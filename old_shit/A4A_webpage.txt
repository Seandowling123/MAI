Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, Trust Fund)
Created by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, the AATF provides funding for improvements to the nation’s airports and air traffic control system. Money in the fund comes solely from users of the system, principally from collections related to passenger tickets, passenger flight segments, international arrivals/departures, cargo waybills, aviation fuels and frequent-flyer mileage awards from nonairline sources like credit cards. Additional Information: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides services to commercial, private, corporate and military aircraft. In large part, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury supports the FAA noncommercial aviation functions. The balance of the FAA budget is funded primarily by airlines and their customers through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF), which Congress established in 1970 “to provide for the expansion and improvement of the nation’s airport and airway system.” The Trust Fund initially aimed to address capital needs, such as runways and taxiways at airports and new computers and radar equipment for the air traffic control (ATC) system. Since then, however, Congress also has used Trust Fund revenues to cover much of the FAA operating budget. Trust Fund revenues come from several excise taxes paid by air carriers, air travelers, shippers and other users of the nation’s airports and ATC services. Congress has increased these taxes, both in scope and size, several times in the last two decades. The cash balance has historically been counted as a credit against federal obligations, thus helping (albeit artificially) to balance the nation’s budget. With enactment of AIR-21, however, Congress mandated that all taxes and interest paid into the fund in any given year be expended the following year, ensuring that capital-development projects critical to FAA modernization are no longer neglected. NOTE: Trust Fund taxes expired 1/1/96-8/26/96 and 1/1/97-3/6/97.

Airport Improvement Program (AIP)
Established under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, this program provides grants to public agencies and, in some cases, to private owners and entities for the planning and development of public-use airports that are included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). Eligible projects include those improvements related to enhancing airport safety, capacity, security and environmental concerns.

Air Route Traffic Control Center

Ancillary Revenue
In the case of passenger transportation, revenue from nonticket sources.

Appropriations
Created by an act of Congress, appropriations enable the federal government to fund its activities. Appropriations allow FAA to incur obligations and make payments out of the Treasury for specified purposes.

Area Navigation (RNAV)
Area Navigation (RNAV) is a system that allows navigation on any desired flight path, rather than one defined by ground-based fixed airways. An RNAV system can determine position by referencing the position of ground- or space-based navigation aids, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), using onboard flight management computers.

Artificial Horizon
An instrument that enables a pilot to determine the attitude of the aircraft in relation to the horizon, i.e. whether the aircraft is nose-up, nose-down or banking left or right.

Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS)
A Flight Service Station (FSS) is an air traffic facility that provides information and services to pilots before, during and after flights but does not separate aircraft. Typical services to pilots include opening and closing of flight plans, traffic advisories, emergency assistance, preflight briefings (including weather briefings and notices to airmen (NOTAMs). In 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began a process to provide services to general aviation pilots utilizing a government network of Automated Flight Service Stations via a performance-based contract with Lockheed Martin. In 2007, services previously provided by 58 FAA sites were consolidated into 3 hubs and 15 refurbished existing facilities.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)
An aircraft-based surveillance service capable of replacing today’s ground-based radar system. With ADS-B, the aircraft GPS determines aircraft location. ADS-B then broadcasts that position, via a radio transmission, approximately once-per-second, to controllers on the ground and other aircraft. ADS-B would give controllers and other traffic a more precise location for each aircraft. By doing this, a portion of the current infrastructure is, in essence, being shifted to the aircraft. Two major elements of ADS-B comprise the total system. ADS-B Out refers to messages transmitted to ground stations and other aircraft through an onboard transmitter known as a transponder. These messages, using a GPS-derived position, contain information regarding accuracy and position-reliability information. This ensures that the transmitted position meets the requirements necessary for an aircraft to utilize certain airspace or advanced procedures. A robust ground-based system then receives, processes and displays this information for use by air traffic control facilities. ADS-B In refers to the aircraft and ground software and hardware that unlock the potential for greatly advanced air-traffic procedures. Several applications, currently under development, leverage the foundational elements created by the ADS-B Out rule and the associated ground infrastructure. Much greater safety, efficiency, environmental benefits and capacity will be available, compared to the current dated system of ground-based radars and voice communications.

Available Seat Mile (ASM)
One seat transported one mile; the most common measure of airline seating capacity or supply. For example, an aircraft with 100 passenger seats, flown a distance of 100 miles, produces 10,000 ASMs. Sometimes measured as an available seat kilometer (ASK).

Available Ton Mile (ATM)
One ton of capacity (passenger and/or cargo) transported one mile. Sometimes measured as an available ton kilometer (ATK).

Average Haul
The average distance one ton is carried. It is computed by dividing ton miles or ton kilometers by tons of freight originated.

Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS)
A system that enables users to perform integrated queries across multiple databases, search an extensive warehouse of safety data and display pertinent elements in an array of useful formats.

Bermuda I Agreement
The agreement that governed scheduled air-transport services between the United States and the United Kingdom until it was replaced in 1977, was signed on February 11, 1946, and came to be known as the Bermuda Agreement. Term is now commonly used for any agreements that contain capacity and pricing provisions patterned on the first U.S.-U.K. agreement. Such agreements include: (1) Capacity Principles: Requirements that an airline’s capacity must meet in providing services over agreed routes. (2) Designation: Each party is entitled to designate “an airline or airlines” for operation of services over the agreed routes, subject to appropriate laws and regulations; (3) Pricing Article: This sets forth requirements for establishing prices to be charged by designated airlines for services over the agreed routes. The article specifies what consultative procedures are to be followed if a party is dissatisfied with a price proposed by an airline, and ultimately allows that party to exercise unilateral control if agreement is not reached.

Bermuda II Agreement
Following British denunciation of the Bermuda I Agreement in 1976, a replacement was negotiated and approved on July 23, 1977, to govern air services between the United States and the United Kingdom. Referred to as Bermuda II, this bilateral agreement was subsequently amended in April 1978, December 1980 and November 1982. The revised and amended agreement covers scheduled and charter air transportation. Its principles differ from Bermuda I in three primary respects: First, while the authority for multiple designation still is included, this right is limited for specific passenger and combination routes over the North Atlantic. Second, capacity principles are similar to Bermuda I, except for additional consultative procedures to deal with excess passenger or combination capacity on North Atlantic routes. (The Annex on Capacity was rewritten in 1986.) Third, all U.S.-U.K. North Atlantic cargo operations - scheduled and charter - are covered by an annex, which phased out governmental regulation in 1983 (i.e., full deregulation of cargo).

Bonding Authority

Cargo Waybill
A document that lists the goods and shipping instructions for a cargo shipment. The waybill is frequently attached to the side of a package or envelope and sometimes indicates the customer’s cost to ship the item. There is a 6.25 percent tax on cargo waybills, which is deposited into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Cargo airlines contribute to the AATF in this way.

Cash Balance

Charter
When an aircraft, typically the entire aircraft, is hired for a nonscheduled trip.

Charter Rules
The United States has negotiated several types of charter arrangements with other countries. In several cases, the U.S. government has signed bilateral agreements covering only charter air services, or it has approved provisions for charters in the form of letter exchanges or memoranda of understanding. More frequently, the United States negotiates a charter annex to the standard bilateral agreement. There are two basic types of charter annexes: (1) Country-of-Origin, in which charter air services may be performed by either party’s airlines according to the charterworthiness rules that are effective in the country-of-origin of the traffic; (2) Double Country-of-Origin (Belgian Rules), which dictates that charter air services may be performed by either party’s airlines, from either territory, according to the rules of charterworthiness of either country.

Chicago Agreement
These types of agreements are patterned on the standard-form bilateral international Air Transport Agreement drafted at the conference convened in Chicago in 1944 to establish a multilateral arrangement for international civil aviation. The bilateral form was drafted as a suggested interim measure, pending conclusion of a multilateral exchange of traffic rights, which never materialized. A Chicago agreement provides a general operating framework but, unlike other types of air transport agreements, does not include pricing or capacity arrangements.

Chicago Convention
(December 7, 1944) Consists of general principles, standards and recommended practices for international civil aviation. An outgrowth of the Chicago Conference of 1944, the convention also established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), with headquarters in Montreal. ICAO consists of an Assembly, Council and various other specialized bodies. The organization’s aims and objectives are to develop the principles and techniques of international air navigation, and to foster the planning and development of international air transport. The United States ratified the Chicago Convention on August 9, 1946 (See http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/7300.html).

Consumer Price Index (CPI)
A Department of Labor measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI serves as an economic indicator, a deflator of other economic series and a means of adjusting dollar values.

Continuous Descent Approach (CDA)
The stair-stepped approaches to airports in use today begin many miles from the airport and require substantial time flying at low altitudes. Planes descend in steps and require additional thrust each time they level off. With CDA, an aircraft is positioned at its most efficient cruise altitude until it is relatively close to its destination airport. At that point, the aircraft reduces engine thrust to idle and begins a gentle descent to the runway. Benefits include significant reduction in noise, fuel burn and emissions, and shorter flights.

Contract Authority
Allows a federal agency to enter into contracts before appropriations. For FAA, this most frequently applies to AIP (Airport Improvement Program) funds.

Controlled Time of Arrival
The assignment and acceptance of an entry/use time for a specific NAS resource. Examples include point-in-space metering, time to be at a runway or taxi waypoints.

Flaps
Control surfaces installed on the trailing edge of an aircraft wing and used to increase the amount of lift generated by the wing at slower speeds. Flaps also create drag, which has the effect of slowing an aircraft during its landing approach.

Flight
The entire passage consisting of one or more flight legs, from leaving the airport of origin to arrival at the airport of final destination and operated under one flight number.

Flight Data Recorder (FDR)
Records pertinent technical information about a flight. An FDR will record information about the performance of various aircraft systems, as well as the aircraft’s speed, altitude, heading and other flight parameters. Like a cockpit voice recorder (CVR), a flight data recorder is designed to withstand the forces of a crash, so that its information can be used to reconstruct the circumstances leading up to the accident (the more recent and sophisticated FDR is known as a digital flight data recorder, or DFDR).

Flight Deck
Also called the cockpit, it is the section of an aircraft where pilots sit and control the aircraft.

Rules governing flight during periods of generally good visibility and limited cloud cover (i.e., a pilot’s ability to fly and navigate by looking out the windows of the airplane), predominantly employed by piston-powered general aviation. Aircraft flying under the VFR system are not required to be in contact with air traffic controllers and are responsible for their own separation from other aircraft. The visual flight rules (VFR) system is utilized almost exclusively by recreational pilots or low-flying piston-engine airplanes.

Warsaw Convention
(October 12, 1929) The first international convention pertaining to liability in international air transportation, the Convention prescribes rules for air-carrier liability in case of death or injury to passengers, destruction, loss or damage to baggage, and losses resulting from delay of passengers, baggage and cargo. Liability limits set by the Convention were raised in 1955 by the Hague Protocol to the Warsaw Convention. Some parties to the Warsaw Convention have not ratified the Hague Protocol, which amended the Convention. The United States ratified the Warsaw Convention on July 31, 1934. The United States continued to adhere to the Warsaw Convention only after all airlines serving the United States agreed to sign an amendment that raised the liability limit to $75,000 and prohibited the use of certain Warsaw defenses. This agreement took effect on May 16, 1966. On September 25, 1975, a number of nations, including the United States, signed four Protocols, which amended the Warsaw Convention and the Hague and Guatemala Protocols. The four Protocols amended the increased liability limit found in the Guatemala Protocol, altered the monetary measurement from gold to Special Drawing Rights, and eliminated outdated documentary requirements with respect to the transport of cargo. The Guatemala Protocol and the first three Montreal Protocols have not come into force because the terms of entry into force have not been met.

Examples of wide-body aircraft include the Airbus A300, A310, A330, A340, A350 and A380; the Boeing B-747, B-767, B-777, B-787, DC-10 and MD-11. Technically, any aircraft with a fuselage diameter in excess of 200 inches may be considered a widebody.

Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
A navigation system developed by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is accurate down to three meters (approximately 95 percent of the time). Accuracy is achieved through corrections to the surveyed location of 25 wide-area reference stations on the ground and the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal. WAAS was commissioned in July 2003, and is currently used solely by general aviation.

Wind Shear
Weather phenomenon entailing a strong downdraft of air that can result in the loss of lift for an aircraft passing through it.

Yaw
A description of the movement of the nose of an aircraft from side to side or left and right. Yaw motion is controlled by the vertical stabilizer and the rudder.

Yield
The average amount of revenue received per revenue passenger mile (RPM) or revenue ton mile (RTM), net of taxes.
