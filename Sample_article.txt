Ryanair Holdings will not deviate from its strategy to mainly use its balance sheet to fund its new aircraft deliveries 
with the Boeing 737 Max 10 model.
The Irish carrier has placed an order for 300 new Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft for delivery over a six-year period 
between 2027 and 2033. The order includes 150 firm for the 228-seat model as well as 150 options.
Given the strength of the Ryanair Group's balance sheet, its industry leading credit rating and the approximately 
two-year gap between the last delivery of 197-seat 737-8200 aircraft in financial year 2025, and the first Max in 
financial year 2027, the Group anticipates that capital expenditure will be substantially funded from internal 
cashflows, although it remains opportunistic in its fleet financing strategy.
As of 8 May, Ryanair had received 103 737-8200 out of 210 units under its 2014 contract agreement with Boeing.
Net debt at 31 December 2022 was (EURO)960 million ($1.1 billion), down from (EURO)1.45 billion as of 31 March 
2022, while cash amounted to (EURO)4.1 billion at the end of the December quarter.
The company has issued two Euro-denominated bonds, for an aggregate nominal amount of (EURO)2.05 billion 
since 2020, and has a (EURO)750 million bond maturing in August this year. Last July it signed up to (EURO)6 
billion Euro medium term note programme with Citigroup Global Markets as global coordinator. BNP Paribas and 
Citigroup Global Markets acted as arrangers of the programme. Dealers are Barclays Bank Ireland, BNP Paribas, 
Citigroup Global Markets Europe, Citigroup Global Markets, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole-CIB, Goldman Sachs 
International, Goodbody Stockbrokers, ING Bank, J&E Davy, NatWest Markets, SMBC Bank, Societe Generale and 
Standard Chartered Bank.
The Irish carrier says the new Max 10 deliveries will facilitate disciplined traffic growth of 80% from 168 million 
passengers in year-end March 2023 to 300 million by March 2034. Ryanair expects 50% of these deliveries will 
replace older 737NGs, which will allow Ryanair to continue to operate one of Europe's youngest, most fuel efficient, 
and environmentally sustainable aircraft fleets.
"The Boeing-Ryanair partnership is one of the most productive in commercial aviation history, enabling both 
companies to succeed and expand affordable travel to hundreds of millions of people. Nearly a quarter century after 
our companies signed our first direct airplane purchase, this landmark deal will further strengthen our partnership.

We are committed to delivering for Ryanair and helping Europe's largest airline group achieve its goals by offering 
its customers the lowest fares in Europe," commented Boeing president and chief executive officer Dave Calhoun.
Ryanair says that given the size and scale of the transaction, the order will be subject to shareholder approval at 
Ryanair's 14 September annual general meeting.
