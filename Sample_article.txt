 EasyJet warned investors this week that average fares would be lower than the City had expected. The low-cost 
airline said that fares in the four months to January were 6 per cent below last year because it tried to increase the 
number of seats being filled by Go, the low-cost rival that it bought last year.
EasyJet's shares fell 14 per cent to 213p.
 EasyJet's problems seem to be worsening. It indicated that, for the half-year to March, average fares would 
probably be down by around 8 per cent - the same as recently reported by Ryanair. Analysts at BNP Paribas cut 
full-year EPS forecasts by 9 per cent to 18.5p. EasyJet isn't as capable of absorbing lower fares as Ryanair 
because it has higher costs - the result of flying to more popular airports.
 IC VIEW
 The scale of fare reductions was surprising, vindicating the critics of last year's Go acquisition. But the deal still 
makes long-term strategic sense and, on a forward PE of 12, the shares are worth holding on to.
