The Irish budget carrier yet again took aim at "state aid doping", reaffirmed its bleak traffic expectations for the

Revenue in the financial year that ended March 31 was 10% higher annually at EUR8.49 billion from EUR7.70

Irish carrier Ryanair returned to profit in July thanks to a strong holiday season, but 
expects a "difficult" winter, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told AFP on Tuesday.
"We went back to profit in July, we'll make a profit again in August because the recovery has been very strong in
