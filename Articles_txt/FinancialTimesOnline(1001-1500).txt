Following the US entity's sector update, advising underweight for the IAG, analysts foresee challenges for

They favor low-cost carriers like Ryanair for better margins and growth.
In a day where the European travel sector falls 0.75%, IAG leads declines, despite earlier recovery.
While JP Morgan's assessment differs, with 71.9% advising buying, an 18.8% hold, and 9.4% sell, overall optimism

Ryanair welcomes the High Court ruling that prohibits screenscraper Flightbox from unlawfully scraping Ryanair's 
website. The ruling aims to protect customers from price gouging by OTAs who overcharge for air fares and 
ancillary services. Customers face difficulties accessing their bookings and receiving important flight updates. The 
ruling reinforces Ryanair's determination to ensure customers have access to the lowest fares and can manage 
their bookings directly through Ryanair's website or mobile app.
Key Highlights:
* OTAs not only overcharge for fares, bags, and seats but also block customers from managing their bookings or 
receiving flight updates from Ryanair
* Ryanair does not have a commercial relationship with any OTA or screenscraper
* Ryanair encourages customers to book directly through their website or mobile app
Original Press Release:
Dec. 7 -- Ryanair Group issued the following news release:
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (7 Dec) welcomes the judgement of the Irish High Court granting a permanent 
injunction prohibiting screenscraper Flightbox from breaching the binding Terms of Use of the Ryanair website by 
using bot technology to unlawfully scrape Ryanair's website for OTAs.
Ryanair has long campaigned to protect customers from price gouging by OTAs who continue to dupe 
unsuspecting consumers by unlawfully scraping Ryanair's website, including by overcharging for air fares and 
ancillary services, using fake customer accounts, fake customer payment cards and fake customer emails. This can 
be hugely detrimental to customers who, apart from being overcharged, cannot access their Ryanair bookings, 
make the necessary security declarations, access refunds, or receive direct email communications (such as online 
check-in reminders) from Ryanair. This historical and precedent-setting Court ruling is a major step forward in 
RYANAIR WELCOMES HIGH COURT RULING CONFIRMING SCREENSCRAPING IS UNLAWFUL
protecting unsuspecting consumers from being overcharged by OTAs (see table below), and will help to ensure that 
Ryanair customers always get the lowest fares, the best customer service, and real time email communications.
Ryanair's Dara Brady said:
"We welcome this High Court ruling which established that this screenscraper is bound by the Terms of Use of the 
Ryanair website, which prohibits screenscraping. Ryanair has been granted a permanent injunction to stop this 
unlawful screencraping of Ryanair's data in breach of Ryanair's Terms of Use. The Ryanair website is the only 
website authorised to sell Ryanair flights.
OTAs have for years relied upon screenscrapers (such as Flightbox), fake customer accounts, single-use payment 
cards and fake customer email addresses to make bookings on Ryanair's website in breach of the Terms of Use. 
This can cause huge inconvenience and expense to customers as often OTAs not only overcharge for fares, bags 
and seats, but they also block customers from managing their bookings or receiving important flight updates from 
Ryanair (such as online check-in reminders).
This historic High Court ruling has reinforced Ryanair's determination to pursue justice for our customers to ensure 
they get access to the lowest fares, cannot be overcharged by OTAs, and that they have direct access to manage 
their bookings and to receive up to date flight information.
Ryanair does not have a commercial relationship with any OTA or screenscraper and we strongly object to OTAs 
mis-selling our flights and overcharging consumers. We encourage our customers to book directly with us through 
ryanair.com or our mobile app."

Internet travel giant www.Booking.com has accused Ryanair of "stealing customers away" from the company in the 
latest salvo fired in a major legal battle between the pair in the United States.
Ryanair has sued www.Booking.com and its subsidiaries for alleged screen-scraping of its fares. Now 
www.Booking.com wants the court's permission to amend its counterclaims against the carrier, partly on foot of 
comments Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary made to the Irish Independent following the airline's annual general 
meeting in September.
www.Booking.com claims it has seen a "dramatic escalation" of customer complaints after the airline allegedly told 
customers who paid for seats through www.Booking.com that their reservations were "blocked", or that they would 
have to pay a (EURO)55 verification fee at the airport.
That has prompted www.Booking.com to add a potential claim of "unjust enrichment" against Ryanair, if the 
Delaware court dealing with the case approves its amended counterclaims. Ryanair has opposed the effort to file 
the amended counterclaims.
Ryanair has sued www.Booking.com and its subsidiaries including Kayak, Agoda and Priceline for alleged screen-
scraping of its fares.
Screen-scraping involves a third party accessing an airline's website and often offering that airline's fares to its own 
customers via its own website.
Ryanair is accused of 'stealing customers' by www.Booking.com CEO Michael O'Leary had labelled travel firm 
'internet pirates'
The pair have been locked in the legal fight in the US since 2020, with a suite of executives from both sides, 
including Mr O'Leary, having been deposed in recent months.
Ryanair has claimed that www.Booking.com and its subsidiaries are depriving the airline of the "opportunity to 
maximise its revenues" from its own website, and of bypassing the carrier's website security.
Ryanair failed earlier this year to have all of Booking's counterclaims thrown out. Instead, the court dismissed just 
one of the counterclaims - for defamation linked to Ryanair's public statements.
But now Booking Holdings has sought leave to amend its counterclaims against Ryanair, including making a fresh 
defamation claim on foot of Mr O'Leary's comments in September and emails allegedly sent by the airline to 
www.Booking.com customers.
It has told the court that the specific defamation counterclaim against Ryanair was previously dismissed because 
the court deemed that there was "no suggestion" that the online travel agents being referred to [in Ryanair's public 
statements] is www.Booking.com."
"That is no longer the case," lawyers for Booking Holdings and its subsidiaries have insisted.
They have pointed to comments made by Mr O'Leary to the Irish Independent immediately following the airline's 
annual general meeting on September 14.
"We have a great case," Mr O'Leary told the Irish Independent. "What www.Booking.com and the other OTAs 
(online travel agents) does is unconscionable. They mislead customers. They're internet pirates for a start."
During his deposition on September 26, Mr O'Leary was quizzed about the comments by Booking's lawyers.
"Ryanair's false and misleading statements disparage and delegitimise Booking.com's valid commercial activity, 
unnecessarily confuse and burden customers, degrade the customer experience, and as such, undermine trust and 
confidence in www.Booking.com and deter customers from using www.Booking.com in the future," the OTA's 
lawyers have claimed.
Booking Holdings and its subsidiaries want significant damages awarded against Ryanair and the airline prevented 
from contacting www.Booking.com customers or making "false" statements about the travel agent.
Yesterday, Ryanair released a survey which it claims is "exposing the scams and overcharging of these OTA 
pirates".

Ryanair's denial of e-boarding pass fee is absurd: NI passenger
Ryanair's denial of e-boarding pass fee is absurd: NI passenger

A NORTHERN IRELAND man has said claims by Ryanair that customers haven't been required to pay for seating 
in order to download a digital boarding pass on their phone are "absurd".
There has been confusion after some customers hit out at the budget airline for an apparent change in policy - a 
change the airline denied was in force.
Passengers happy to accept a random seat allocation say they were offered the option of queueing at a Ryanair 
check-in desk to print a paper boarding pass at the airport, or to pay to reserve a specific seat in order to display an 
e-boarding pass on their smartphone. Previously, those accepting a random seat would have received a free online 
boarding pass on their phone as well.
However, a spokesperson for Europe's biggest budget airline, when contacted by the Belfast Telegraph, said: 
"There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass - ever."
Both e-boarding passes and printed passes are typically offered without a requirement to pay for seat selection by 
most airlines.
One local man, who recently travelled from Dublin to Faro, said he checked in for a flight on Saturday.
"I was surprised to see that I was checked in but a [smartphone] boarding pass was unavailable unless I chose to 
select and pay for a seat," he said.
He was further advised to "proceed to the Ryanair desk to collect my boarding pass for free, or I could choose a 
seat [and pay] and get an instant boarding pass".
Ryanair's denial of e-boarding pass fee is absurd: NI passenger
He added: "The fact Ryanair are saying in your article they do not charge is absurd - if I wanted it [his boarding 
pass] instantly I had to pay for it."
The man said he enquired at the desk whether he would be required to go through the same process on the return 
trip and was told by the attendant she wasn't sure.
"She told me that they are trialling this in some airports but she wasn't sure which ones," he explained.
"Clearly they didn't put a lot of thought into it."
The issue is still far from clear at present.
A spokesperson for Ryanair said in response: "As per our statement, which this passenger correctly points out, 
there is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass - ever."
The airline also told media: "All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish, or if passengers 
wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge."
Queries to the 'Ask Ryanair' account on X (formerly Twitter), stated that "due to popularity of reserved seats, 
Ryanair is keeping seats available until the end for those customers wishing to purchase.
"Some passengers will be assigned the last remaining seats at the airport for free."
The Belfast Telegraph asked Ryanair specifically: can passengers who don't choose a seat - and who therefore 
avoid the seat fee - also get their digital boarding pass for free on their mobile phone?
So far there has been no response to this question.

TRAVEL giant On The Beach has slammed low cost airlines for their 'anti competitive behaviours' - and has vowed 
to keep pursuing Ryanair after a £2m court victory.
The Manchester group has announced record revenues for 2023 - and also said it had won a legal claim against 
Ryanair over outstanding refunds on cancelled or changed flights. It said it had been awarded £2m plus interest and 
costs.
OTB said it intended to pursue Ryanair 'for further sums due in similar circumstances.' .' And it also called for action 
from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) over the actions of low-cost airlines.
In his statement to the Stock Market this week, CEO Shaun Morton said the travel industry urgently needed 'holistic 
and comprehensive regulatory reform' to create a level playing field for businesses and consumers.
He said: "The market power of the few airlines operating popular leisure routes from the UK, and how that power 
manifests itself to the detriment of consumers, poses a serious threat to fair competition and choice for consumers. 
Low cost airlines ('LCA') are using anticompetitive behaviours to stop consumers booking through online travel 
agents, harming consumers in the process. These increasingly sophisticated anti-competitive behaviours include 
blocking OTA (online
We continue challenge anti-behaviour CEO Shaun travel agency) bookings, reducing or removing seats to certain 
destinations, making them completely unbookable by OTAs or consumers unless booked directly with the airline; 
and false and misleading smear campaigns that cast doubt in the minds of consumers about the validity and 
benefits of booking package holidays with OTAs."

He added: "We continue to challenge Ryanair on its anti-competitive behaviour and withholding of refunds through 
ongoing litigation. We recently successfully sued Ryanair for £2m of outstanding flight refunds."

Highlight: A Ryanair flight from Dublin Airport to Lanzarote was forced to land in Morocco after a passenger 
became "disruptive" on board
Body
A Ryanair flight from Dublin Airport to Lanzarote had to be diverted to Morocco after one of the passengers became 
"disruptive" on board yesterday morning (Wednesday 6 December). The incident caused the flight to divert to one 
of Morocco's major cities, Agadir.
Once it landed in the local airport the plane was met by Moroccan police on the runway and policemen removed the 
disruptive passenger and took them into custody. The disruption caused by the passenger "is now a matter for 
[Moroccan] police". The flight continued to Lanzarote and arrived "with a short delay". 
A spokeswoman for Ryanair told Dublin Live: "This flight from Dublin to Lanzarote (December 6) diverted to Agadir 
when a passenger became disruptive onboard. Crew called ahead for police assistance and the aircraft was met by 
local police upon arrival who removed the disruptive passenger. The flight continued to Lanzarote following a short 
delay."
It comes after a Ryanair flight heading from London Gatwick to Morocco was forced to divert and make an 
emergency landing at Faro in Portugal on Tuesday morning (5 December) after the pilot fell ill. 
Portuguese paper Correio da Manha said the pilot had told passengers before landing that he wasn’t feeling well 
and the diversion triggered a ‘red alert’ at the airport. The 18 passengers on board were forced to wait at the 
Algarve airport to take off again. A spokesperson from Ryanair told The Daily Mail: “There was no ‘emergency 
landing’. This flight from Stansted to Morocco diverted to Faro when one of the pilots became ill. The aircraft landed 
normally, and passengers were transferred to an alternative aircraft operated by another crew before continuing to 
Morocco.”

Ryanair passengers queue for boarding passes after changes to procedure
Ryanair passengers queue for boarding passes after changes to procedure

BARRY O HALLORAN  A Ryanair passenger who paid more than EUR 230 for return flights from London had to 
queue for about 20 minutes for a boarding pass after the carrier recently changed its rules.
The airline has been under fire this week after it emerged that some passengers who do not pay for reserved seats 
had to queue for boarding passes.
One passenger who contacted The Irish Times paid £200 (EUR 233) for return Stansted-Dublin flights this week 
and had to queue in the London airport for a boarding pass as they did not pay to reserve a seat. The passenger, 
who was travelling to Dublin on short notice for personal reasons, paid £180 for the outward leg from Stansted and 
£20 return.
When the individual checked in online, they opted for a randomly selected seat, a service for which Ryanair does 
not charge. 
Boarding pass Once they requested their boarding pass at the end of the process, they received a message 
saying:  This is not a mobile boarding pass, you must collect your boarding pass at the airport check-in 
desk . They estimated that they had to queue 15-20 minutes at Stansted Airport to get their printed 
boarding pass.
The individual says they chose to pay £9 to reserve a seat on the return leg to avoid waiting at the airport for a 
pass.
Ryanair introduced this procedure recently, sparking reports that the carrier was attempting to charge for boarding 
passes or to prompt more passengers to pay for seats.
However, Ryanair pointed out that it did not charge for digital boarding passes.  All Ryanair passengers can pay for 
a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated 
seat entirely free of charge,  said the airline.
Ryanair charges EUR 8-EUR 21 to reserve seats, asking more for  legroom  seats at emergency exits or at the front 
of the aircraft.

It has three fares: basic, which allows the passenger one small on-board bag; regular, which includes a 10kg that 
can be stowed overhead; and plus, which includes a 20kg check-in bag. The airline maintains that it has to charge 
for extras to keep fares low.

Ryanair's new routes out of Norwich airport will create more than 60 new jobs and bring more than 60,000 
passengers through the terminal each year, the company has revealed. The budget airline confirmed it would begin 
operations at the airport for the first time, with 12 flights a week to and from Malta, Alicante, and Faro starting on 
April 1.
The new jobs created will boost the number of people employed at the airport by around a quarter.
The company said the new routes would also bring more than 60,000 additional passengers to the airport, with 
return tickets currently available to Alicante from £29.99.
It added that the budgetfriendly flights would be "exciting" for passengers, who it said had been "forced to pay sky 
high fares by the high fare carriers who dominate at Norwich Airport".
Ryanair's head of communication, Jade Kirwan, said: "Our new Norwich operation will bring competitive fares and a 
wider selection of summer routes to our customers in Norwich and the wider Norfolk region, and also support 
important regional development through increased connectivity, inbound tourism, and local job creation."
Norwich Airport currently operates flights to 18 destinations in nine countries, with connections to 150 more 
locations via Amsterdam.
Journeys to Malta and the Spanish port city Alicante have been previously available with KLM and the now-
dissolved Flybe, but services were cancelled shortly before the Covid pandemic.
The airport said that although passenger numbers had fallen due to the pandemic, they had returned to around 
80pc of their pre-Covid levels, and that the arrival of Ryanair was due to push that up to 90pc.

Richard Pace, managing director of Norwich Airport, added: "Alicante, Faro and Malta are hugely popular 
destinations and with twice-weekly flights it means we can offer passengers even more great choices from their 
local airport."

There's no doubt that attracting budget airline Ryanair to Norwich for the first time is quite a feather in the cap for 
the city's airport.
When flights start leaving from the runway next year it will mark the first time the Irish company has operated from 
Norwich.
The airline predicts it will increase the number of passengers passing through the airport terminal's doors each year 
by some 60,000 people.
And it says that will create more than 60 new jobs - which would increase the number of people employed at the 
airport by around a quarter.
That is a significant number of new jobs for the city, which will provide a boost to the regional economy.
Passengers will no doubt welcome new flights to and from Malta, Alicante and Faro, particularly if Ryanair is true to 
its word about people not having to pay "sky hire fares" to jet off on their holiday getaways.
Campaigners, who have long criticised the aviation industry for fuelling climate change, are less likely to be 
impressed.
And a word of further caution is, perhaps, needed. There have been too many occasions when airline operators 
have turned up offering flights from Norwich Airport only to not stay the course, or whose services have left 
something to be desired.
Will Ryanair's arrival bring economic take-off?; Opinion SERVING THE COMMUNITY SINCE 1870
TUI has come in for strong criticism over the past couple of summers after a catalogue of delays and disruption, 
with some holidaymakers being diverted to other airports because of issues with some of the planes which were 
being used.
Hopefully, Ryanair's intentions are a vote of confidence in the city - a sign that its fluctuating fortunes are on the up.
Passenger numbers dropped off because of the Covid pandemic. They are now around 80 percent of pre-Covid 
levels. It is predicted the arrival of Ryanair will push it up to 90pc, which will be a welcome boost for airport bosses.

RYANAIR ASKS FOR IMMEDIATE OPENING OF MONTIJO AIRPORT TO STIMULATE GROWTH AND

Ryanair is urging the Portuguese Government to open Montijo Airport urgently to address the capacity crisis in 
Lisbon. The airline argues that the current Lisbon Airport no longer meets the needs and that Montijo should be 
opened to provide additional connectivity and tourism growth. Ryanair also criticizes ANA, the airport's owner, for 
increasing airport fees and harming Portugal's connectivity, tourism, and low fares. The airline has already been 
forced to reduce operations in response to the fee increase.
Key Highlights:
* Passenger fees in Lisbon have increased by 50% since 2019, while most European airports have reduced fees to 
recover traffic and growth
* Ryanair has been forced to withdraw an aircraft from its base in Madeira and reduce traffic in Faro and Porto due 
to the increase in airport fees
* Granting the concession for Montijo to a competitor of AFA would accelerate its opening and bring more traffic, 
tourism growth, and thousands of new jobs to Lisbon and Portugal
Original Press Release:
Dec. 7 -- Ryanair Group issued the following news release:
- INDEPENDENT PROVIDER REQUIRED TO OPERATE MONTIJO AND BREAK ANA'S MONOPOLY
Ryanair, Portugal's main airline, today (7 December), calls on the Portuguese Government to stop wasting time on 
'studies' and 'commissions' and deliver much-needed growth in air transport and tourism to Lisbon. The solution to 
Lisbon's capacity crisis is obvious and lies across the bay in Montijo. Ryanair calls for the urgent opening of Montijo 
Airport following yesterday's announcement by the Independent Technical Commission regarding the new airport in 
the Lisbon area. The current Lisbon airport (Portela) no longer meets the needs and Montijo must be opened 
RYANAIR ASKS FOR IMMEDIATE OPENING OF MONTIJO AIRPORT TO STIMULATE GROWTH AND 
REDUCE FARES IN LISBON
urgently to provide Lisbon and Portugal with the additional connectivity and tourism/job growth needed to stimulate 
the economy.
Montijo Airport should be reopened to break the monopoly of ANA, the company that owns the airport, on access to 
Lisbon airport. ANA, which is increasing airport fees by 17% from 2024, is harming Portugal's connectivity, tourism 
growth, job growth and undermining low fares for Portuguese consumers and visitors. It is no longer acceptable for 
Portugal's citizens and visitors to be exploited by ANA's refusal to accommodate further growth or efficiencies at 
Lisbon Portela Airport.
The French-owned ANA monopoly faces no competition in Portugal, which allows it to increase prices without 
penalty. In Lisbon alone, passenger rates have increased by +50% since 2019, despite most European airports 
reducing passenger rates post-Covid to recover traffic and growth. The Portuguese Government has failed to 
ensure that airports, which play a vital role in the national infrastructure, are used to drive growth for the benefit of 
Portugal's citizens and economy, rather than enriching a French-owned airport monopoly operator.
Ryanair has already been forced to withdraw one aircraft (a $100 million investment) from its base in Madeira this 
winter, while also reducing traffic at Faro and Porto in response to ANA's 17% increase in airport charges from 
2024. However, a decision by the Portuguese Government to grant the concession for Montijo to an AFA competitor 
would accelerate the opening of Montijo and bring more traffic and tourism growth, as well as thousands of new 
jobs to Lisbon and Portugal.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair Group CEO, said:
"The Portuguese Government has been idly talking for years about a second airport for Lisbon, while Montijo 
should have been opened years ago. We are almost in 2024 and we are still waiting for the Portuguese 
Government to make a decision on where to place a new airport for Lisbon. ANA, the French airport monopoly, 
claims that Portela is full and cannot issue any more slots. Any sensible government would ensure that the capital's 
airport has the capacity to grow. The Portuguese Government failed to do this, and the solution is across the bay in 
Montijo.
The time for studies, commissions and more politics is over. Lisbon's citizens and visitors deserve growth in 
frequencies and new routes, and this can only be delivered in Montijo. The airport in Montijo already exists, needs a 
modest investment in terminal infrastructure and could be ready by the summer of 2024 or 2025 if the Portuguese 
Government would just make a decision.
As the former Minister of Transport, Pedro Nuno Santos, said, Portugal is wasting a lot of time postponing this 
decision on the second airport. The decision must be made now. The Portuguese Government must wake up and 
open Montijo to prevent the French monopoly VINCI from enriching itself at the expense of Portugal's citizens and 
visitors with inflationary price increases in Lisbon, Portela, whilst artificially restricting capacity growth in Portela. 
Competition for Montijo will bring growth, choice and lower fares for Portugal's citizens and visitors, and Montijo 
must be opened urgently, preferably under the management of a new airport operator, if the future growth and 
health of Lisbon's tourism industry is to be maintained. guaranteed.
The time for hesitation and delay is over. The time to select Montijo as Lisbon's second airport and allocate its 
operation to an airport operator competing with the French monopoly VINCI has long passed ."

Body
A Ryanair flight from Dublin to Lanzarote had to be diverted to a country in north Africa yesterday after a passenger 
on board became "disruptive".
The incident, which happened after the flight left Dublin Airport yesterday morning, December 6, caused the flight to 
be re-routed to one of Morocco's major cities, Agadir. 
Once it landed in the local airport, the plane was met on the runway by Moroccan police who removed the 
disruptive passenger and took them into custody, Dublin Live reports.
After this disturbance, the flight continued to Lanzarote and arrived "with a short delay". 
A spokeswoman for Ryanair told the Irish Mirror: "This flight from Dublin to Lanzarote 6 Dec diverted to Agadir 
when a passenger became disruptive onboard. 
"Crew called ahead for police assistance and the aircraft was met by local police upon arrival who removed the 
disruptive passenger. 
"The flight continued to Lanzarote following a short delay."
Meanwhile, the Ryanair spokesperson said the disruption caused by the passenger "is now a matter for [Moroccan] 
police".

Why do I have to queue for a boarding pass on Ryanair ?
Why do I have to queue for a boarding pass on Ryanair?

Body
Q I've read of an apparently new requirement for some Ryanair passengers to queue up at the airport for a 
boarding pass rather than using a code on their mobile phone. Could it be because Ryanair's new Boeing 737 Max 
aircraft have more seats than their 737-800 aircraft? In the event of an equipment change, it could mean the 
unlucky few on a full flight could be moved onto the next one - which is something they would do at the check-in 
desk?
TTD
A Ryanair's airport arrangements for passengers, like me, who prefer to avail of the basic fare on budget airlines 
without any added extras, abruptly changed at the weekend. The standard option to show a mobile boarding pass 
on their smart phone was not open to some of them. Instead, they were offered a choice between paying for an 
assigned seat - costing £8 or more - or queuing at an airport check-in desk for a paper boarding pass to their 
randomly assigned seat.
A spokesperson for the airline told me: "If passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly 
allocated seat entirely free of charge." That's true, but it does not explain the current issue. So I have been studying 
the airline's customer-care feed on social media. One passenger was told: "Due to popularity of reserved seats, 
Ryanair is keeping seats available until the end for those customers wishing to purchase. Some passengers will be 
assigned the last remaining seats at the airport for free."
The idea that Ryanair has to hold seats back because people routinely decide at an airport to pay extra to reserve a 
space looks preposterous. All of us who are content with random allocation have declined repeated invitations to 
pay extra. But were I running late and/or the queue for boarding passes looked too long, I would reluctantly pay up - 
and it seems others are, too. The aim seems to be: to increase the number of passengers who pay for a specific 
seat by offering an unpalatable alternative: another airport hurdle and queue.
Why do I have to queue for a boarding pass on Ryanair ?
You smartly raise the "downgauging" issue: when an older 189-seat jet has to replace a newer 197-seat plane. This 
is a rare event, and when it happens there are almost always enough seats because of "no-shows"; Ryanair does 
not overbook. I have only heard of one confirmed incident. In common with other airlines such episodes are 
handled at the departure gate - with the carrier obliged to offer incentives to lure volunteers to offload, or pay cash 
compensation for involuntary denial of boarding.

Few foreign airlines are operating flights to and from Israel and the situation seems unlikely to change in the near 
future. "Globes" has learned that Ryanair, which has the biggest aircraft fleet in Europe, and is one of the most 
popular low-cost carriers operating in and out of Ben Gurion airport, is to cancel all its flights to and from Israel in 
January. An official announcement on the matter has not yet been released.
The frequency of flights landing and taking off from Ben Gurion airport has fallen 80% since the start of the war on 
October 7th from 500 per day to just 100 per day. Most foreign airlines have canceled all flights to Israel, in part 
because of the refusal of insurance companies to provide them with coverage.
With government insurance guarantees the three Israeli airlines - El Al, Arkia and Israir - are continuing their flights. 
El Al has canceled flights to some destinations including Sharm el-Sheikh, Istanbul, Dublin, Marseilles, and Tokyo.
The few foreign airlines that are operating flights to and from Israel include Ethiopian Airlines to Addis Ababa, 
Etihad Airways to Abu Dhabi, flyDubai to Dubai, Uzbekistan Airways to Tashkent, and Azimuth Airline and Red 
Wings to Russia.

A beauty salon is hoping to see more clients through its doors after opening its new extension which has been six 
months in the making.
Pampers Beauty Centre in London Street in Norwich has a history stretching back more than 40 years and Nicky 
Morley has owned the salon since 2016.
Over the past six months she has been refurbishing the first floor of the building along with her husband Andy and 
tonight they are hosting a launch event with goodie bags and discount offers.
"We have completely gutted the first floor to bring it up to date and up to standard and make us one whole salon," 
Mrs Morley said.
"We have a very posh new reception area with a coffee bar and the reception is on the main first floor to greet all 
our clients on entry.
"And we've added two new treatment rooms and a new toilet as well."

The beauty centre offers an extensive list of treatments, with everything from facials and nails to massages, IPL hair 
removal and electrolysis.
It has a resident aesthetics doctor and a team of very experienced hairdressers providing cuts, colours and 
extensions.
"We have the most amazing view of London Street from the salon," Mrs Morley said. "One that you just don-t get 
anywhere else - the city is so beautiful and even more so at this time of year."

The mother-of-two said the best part of the whole refurbishment has been the extra time spent with her family.
She added: "It has been myself and my amazing husband Andy that have completed the work between us over the 
last six months.
"Working alongside, and with two children and a dog, it-s been a busy and hectic time but we feel so proud of what 
we have achieved.
Tonight (December 7), in celebration of the launch, the salon will be offering course discounts, special offers on 
retail, goodie bags and a glass of bubbly for its clients to say thank you for their support.

Military flights 'best option for Prestwick'
Military flights 'best option for Prestwick'

Bosses at Prestwick airport say they will continue to focus on military flights and cargo, rather than growing 
passenger numbers, as they aim to make it attractive to potential buyers.
The Ayrshire site has returned to profit in recent years largely through an upturn in the amounts of fuel it is selling to 
military aircraft.
Prestwick was bought by the Scottish government for a token £1 in November 2013 and owes about £52 million in 
loans and interest to the public purse.
Forsyth Black, the chairman, suggested it was important to ensure the airport had multiple income streams and 
indicated attracting new passenger flights was not a priority. Ryanair is the only airline running passenger flights 
from Prestwick. Black said: "We talk to other passenger airlines from time to time but they are not our major focus. 
We know we have to focus more on cargo and military at the moment."
The Scottish parliament heard how a deal to sell the airport back to the private sector was 95 per cent complete 
before it was scuppered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ian Forgie, the airport's chief executive, said of the potential buyers: "They were another airport business and they 
had to withdraw to focus on their investments elsewhere." But he confirmed the early stages of due diligence had 
just started on a new approach.
However, Black said: "Sometimes we get bids where there is no credible plan and no credible money and it is 
almost pie in the sky." He added none of the approaches received since he joined the board two years ago had 
been recommended to the Scottish government as a credible buyer and also confirmed none of the debt to the 
public purse would be repaid until the airport was returned to the private sector.
Military flights 'best option for Prestwick'
Black said: "The more profit it makes, the greater value it will have when it is ultimately returned to the private 
sector. It is absolutely a going concern to return it to the private sector. The question for us is how we can maximise 
value for the Scottish taxpayer."
Neil Gray, the wellbeing economy minister, said the government's "door remains open" to credible offers but it 
would not be "a distressed seller".

Highlight: Airport bought by Scottish government will focus more on cargo and armed forces in effort to attract 
buyers
Body
Bosses at Prestwick airport say they will continue focus on military flights and cargo, rather than growing passenger 
numbers, as they aim to make it as attractive as possible to potential buyers.
The Ayrshire site has returned to profit in recent years largely through an upturn in the amounts of fuel it is selling to 
military aircraft particularly those from North America.
Prestwick was bought by the Scottish government for a token £1 in November 2013 and owes about £52 million in 
loans and interest 
to the public purse
.
Forsyth Black, the chairman, suggested it was important to ensure 
the airport had multiple income streams
 and indicated attracting new passenger flights was not a priority.
He also stated the airport was not aware of having hosted any rendition flights as all military aircraft landings had to 
be legally approved by the UK government.
But he did acknowledge what might happen on board a plane was “not something” to which the airport was always 
party and that the doors on some aircraft never opened after touching down in Ayrshire.
Ryanair is the only airline running passenger flights from Prestwick. Black said: “We talk to other passenger airlines 
from time to time but they are not our major focus.
Military flights ‘best way to repay taxpayer for Prestwick airport’
“We know we have to focus more on cargo and military at the moment.”
Members of Holyrood’s economy and fair work committee also heard how a deal to sell the airport back to the 
private sector was 95 per cent complete before it was scuppered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ian Forgie, the airport’s chief executive, said of the potential buyers: “They were another airport business and they 
had to withdraw to focus on their investments elsewhere.
“We have to set the bar pretty high here because we want to make sure we have the right home for this.
“We have turned it into a profitable business. If it is going to be sold it has to go into the right hands with real 
aviation experience to take it into the next generation and the next level.”
Forgie confirmed the early stages of due diligence had just started on a new approach, although Black said many 
such attempts got “filtered out” before moving forward.
Black said: “Sometimes we get bids where there is no credible plan and no credible money and it is almost pie in 
the sky.” 
He added none of the approaches received since he joined the board two years ago had been recommended to the 
Scottish government as a credible buyer. 
He also confirmed none of the debt to the public purse would be repaid until the airport was returned to the private 
sector.
Prestwick has about £43 million in loans with the interest on those in the region of £9 million.
Black confirmed there was no intention to pay dividends to the Scottish government from profits and the borrowing 
would become repayable only “on a liquidity event” such as a sale or merger.
He said: “It is a stated aim of our owners to return it to the commercial sector. We have taken the former lossmaking 
Infratil asset and turned it around to be sustainably profitable.
“The more profit it makes, the greater value it will have when it is ultimately returned to the private sector.
“It is absolutely a going concern to return it to the private sector. The question for us is how we can maximise value 
for the Scottish taxpayer when that liquidity event happens.”
Neil Gray, the wellbeing economy minister, said the government’s “door remains open” to credible offers but it 
would not be “a distressed seller”.

Belarus Bans Landing of Aircraft from EU without Special Authorization

The government of Belarus has implemented a ban on the landing of any aircraft entering from European Union 
airspace, effective December 3, 2023. The ban requires special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 
landing, and it will be in force until at least March 3, 2024. Overflights are not affected by this decision.
The corresponding NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), O0770/23, was issued to protect national interests, according to 
Belaeronavigatsiya. Simultaneously, the ban extends to aircraft departing from Belarus, preventing them from 
entering the airspace of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia-Belarus's EU neighbors.
The impact of this decision is limited, given that all Belarusian airlines have been banned from entering the EU 
since December 2021. The EU imposed the ban in response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair B737 orchestrated 
by Belarus to arrest anti-government activists on board. Belarus's alignment with Russia during the invasion of 
Ukraine further heightened tensions. Currently, there is no airline traffic between the EU and Russia/Belarus. 
Foreign airlines from non-EU countries, however, continue to serve Minsk National, linking the city with destinations 
in Russia and other Asian countries without overflying the EU.

The government of Belarus has implemented a ban on the landing of any aircraft entering from European Union 
airspace, effective December 3, 2023. The ban requires special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 
landing, and it will be in force until at least March 3, 2024. Overflights are not affected by this decision.
The corresponding NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), O0770/23, was issued to protect national interests, according to 
Belaeronavigatsiya. Simultaneously, the ban extends to aircraft departing from Belarus, preventing them from 
entering the airspace of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia-Belarus's EU neighbors.
The impact of this decision is limited, given that all Belarusian airlines have been banned from entering the EU 
since December 2021. The EU imposed the ban in response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair B737 orchestrated 
by Belarus to arrest anti-government activists on board. Belarus's alignment with Russia during the invasion of 
Ukraine further heightened tensions. Currently, there is no airline traffic between the EU and Russia/Belarus. 
Foreign airlines from non-EU countries, however, continue to serve Minsk National, linking the city with destinations 
in Russia and other Asian countries without overflying the EU.

since December 2021. The EU imposed the ban in response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair B737 orchestrated 
by Belarus to arrest anti-government activists on board. Belarus's alignment with Russia during the invasion of 
Ukraine further heightened tensions. Currently, there is no airline traffic between the EU and Russia/Belarus. 
Foreign airlines from non-EU countries, however, continue to serve Minsk National, linking the city with destinations 
in Russia and other Asian countries without overflying the EU.

The government of Belarus has implemented a ban on the landing of any aircraft entering from European Union 
airspace, effective December 3, 2023. The ban requires special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 
landing, and it will be in force until at least March 3, 2024. Overflights are not affected by this decision.
The corresponding NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), O0770/23, was issued to protect national interests, according to 
Belaeronavigatsiya. Simultaneously, the ban extends to aircraft departing from Belarus, preventing them from 
entering the airspace of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia-Belarus's EU neighbors.

Highlight: Images show the inside of the biggest private jet in the world, dubbed the "Flying Mansion" where there 
are luxurious bedrooms, living space and bathrooms including gold trims
Body
A plane dubbed the "Flying Mansion" is the perfect runaround for people with a taste for luxury and millions to 
spend.
The world's biggest private jet has everything you need to start any getaway in style. For people who enjoy the finer 
details in life this is the ideal option but this plane is a one off and sadly not for sale.
A Boeing 747-8 has been specially designed so that for passengers it is like flying in an exclusive hotel. The sheer 
size of the plane means that guests on board can nip between various rooms while flying at 35,000 feet, head 
upstairs or take a nap in a bedroom littered with gold trim.
The Middle Eastern owner of the jet has had the plane extravagantly designed with living areas, dining rooms and 
several bedrooms, leading to it being nicknamed the "Flying Mansion". The bedrooms also feature en-suite 
bathrooms covered in mirrors and decorated with wooden furnishings and more gold trim. 
A golden staircase leads from the master bedroom up to the main living area, lined with colour-coordinated 
bookshelves, artwork on the walls and plush sofas to relax on a long-haul flight. A separate living area also features 
three couches, perfect for unwinding over games or drinks after a long day of premium flying.
While it boasts plenty of space, the plane clearly doesn't scrimp on style. Materials like exotic wood can be found 
throughout and the entire vehicle is kitted out with touchscreen-controlled lights to make sure the mood is always 
set.
Inside world's biggest private jet 'Flying Mansion' with bedrooms and gold trims
 The Boeing 747-8 was first flown in November 2005. With a wingspan of 224ft, the enormous jet can hold up to 
467 passengers at a time - more than twice the capacity of a Ryanair plane. And the cost of this private jet hasn't 
been listed anywhere but its value is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of pounds.
Less than 10 private jets the size of a Boeing 747 are believed to be currently flying due to the astronomical costs 
that come with running it. The jet is owned by real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, whose net worth is thought to be more 
than £10.3billion, according to simpleflying.com.

SFO launches probe into jet engine scam

THE boss of a firm at the centre of an alleged fake plane parts scandal has been arrested as part of a criminal fraud 
probe.
Police arrested Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, director of aircraft parts supplier AOG Technics, at his London home 
yesterday morning.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and National Crime Agency (NCA) launched an investigation into the business 
after bogus components were found in planes.
The company has been in business since 2015 and supplied parts for CF56, the world's best-selling passenger 
aircraft engine. But the firm is accused of providing fake authentication certificates, raising concerns over safety.
SFO director Nick Ephgrave said: 'This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply 
of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.'
He said the SFO would be 'vigorous' with its investigation and 'establish the facts as swiftly as possible'.
Ephgrave told Bloomberg: 'We are now going through front doors, making arrests and seizing properties.'
AOG Technics could not be contacted for comment.
Last week Ryanair became the latest airline to confirm dodgy parts had been found in two of its planes.
The discovery was made during maintenance checks carried out in Texas and Brazil in the past few months.
The parts, which were found in two of Ryanair's Boeing planes, have been removed, the company said.
US carriers Delta, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also found the fake parts on their planes.
SFO launches probe into jet engine scam
The SFO investigation is the first criminal action since regulators were alerted to fake parts found in Boeing and 
Airbus planes earlier this year.
Aviation watchdogs allegedly traced the supplies back to AOG Technics, an obscure London-based firm. 
Regulators in the UK, US and Europe accused the company of supplying engine parts with faked certification 
documents.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority announced in August that it was 'investigating the supply of a large number of 
suspect unapproved parts' that could be traced back to AOG Technics.
It issued a safety notice warning airlines that some of the parts were used in engines fitted in UK planes. Operators 
and owners were told to investigate their records for parts bought directly or indirectly from the firm.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency also said in August that it was examining reports of parts with 
suspected falsified documents.
The US Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines about the scandal and Bloomberg has reported that the US 
Justice Department is in the early stages of a probe.

Highlight: Spain is typically a summer hotspot but in winter one of its cities becomes a gorgeous Christmas 
destination with impressive Christmas lights displays and festive markets
Body
Who said that a Christmas city break means you need to pack heaps of layers and brace yourself for Arctic-feeling 
winds 
There's one gorgeous Spanish city that offers plenty of festive cheer -and with temperatures of around 17C in 
December it won't be hot, but it won't be freezing either! 
Malaga tends to be a popular destination in the summer as Brits flock to its soft sandy beaches and bustling resorts, 
but it very much holds its own in winter too. 
It's also said to be home to some of the world's best Christmas Light displays, reports the Express. That's because 
if you head to the pedestrianised Calle Larios, you'll find 16 breathtaking angels in an impressive show that runs 
three times every evening and lasts for about eight minutes. However if you're hoping for a good view, get there 
early, as it can get quite busy with crowds of locals and visitors alike gathering to watch the 3D projections on the 
city's iconic Cathedral.
For Brits hoping to tick some European Christmas markets off the list, Malaga won't disappoint. This year the 
market is running until January 6, 2024, so there's ample opportunity to explore. You can expect plenty of festive 
stalls at the Paseo del Parque market selling everything from gifts and decorations to mulled wine and roasted 
chestnuts, with a number of shops staying open into the evening for those trying to give Santa a helping hand by 
picking up gifts for the family. 
Beautiful Spanish city has 'world's best Christmas lights' and warm winter weather
Oh, and foodies won't want to miss out on some traditional sweets including shortbread, marzipan, nougat and 
borrachuelos wine-flavoured fried pastries. You'll also find an impressive amount of decorations dotted throughout 
the city from Nativity scenes to twinkling lights and wicker figures. 
Getting to Malaga doesn't have to be a bank-breaking experience either. When we took a look on Skyscanner you 
could find flights from £25 each way with the likes of Ryanair and Wizz Air, no doubt as you're travelling outside of 
the peak season for Spain holidays. As for hotels, Kayak has stays from £33 a night. 
It's not the only festive city you'll want on your radar. For those after an extra dose of festivities, Prague was 
recently named Europe's merriest destination. It's not surprising considering the Czech capital is tipped to have one 
of Europe's best Christmas markets. Add in the gorgeous architecture, snowy weather and cosy restaurants and 
bars, and it's no wonder that visitors from all over the world flock to the city every winter. 
You'll find a lot of the festive action in the Old Town Square where a huge Christmas tree awaits along with a 
nativity scene, carol-singing choirs and plenty of stalls selling everything you could need for a picture-perfect 
Christmas. 
Looking for more inspiration Check out our Christmas markets guide which we're regularly updating with reviews, 
destination tips and deals that we think you'll want on your radar.

Fraud investigators have arrested a UK businessman at the centre of a suspect aircraft parts investigation following 
a dawn raid on his home.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), together with National Crime Agency officers, arrested an individual linked to UK-
based AOG Technics Ltd, a company supplying aircraft parts, some of them safety-critical, to major airlines in the 
UK and around the world.
The SFO said the raid was part of a new criminal investigation into the company, which is already under 
investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority. SFO investigators said they seized material and were continuing to 
question the person arrested.
AOG has supplied parts for the world's best-selling passenger aircraft engine, the CF56, which is used in Airbus 
and Boeing aircraft, as well as parts for the CF6 engine, widely employed in cargo aircraft.
Portuguese airline TAP was first to raise the alarm early this year. It discovered that some engine parts showed 
significant wear despite having been supplied by AOG with documents suggesting they were new.
The discovery led to regulators issuing international safety alerts, and more parts were discovered on planes 
operated by other carriers including Ryanair, Delta, American Airlines and Southwestern.
The SFO said it was working closely with the Civil Aviation Authority and other regulators to examine the 
information obtained.

An individual has been arrested as part of an investigation into AOG Technics, the company accused of supplying 
suspicious engine parts to airlines, the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced Wednesday Dec. 6.
Affected airlines include Tui, Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.
According to Bloomberg, the person in custody is AOG Technics' founder and director, Jose Alejandro Zamora 
Yrala. Business Insider reached out to the SFO for confirmation on this but didn't immediately hear back. AOG 
Technics could not be reached by BI.
"This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the 
consequences of which are potentially far-reaching," said Nick Ephgrave, the SFO director.
"We are determined to establish the facts as swiftly as possible," he added.
The SFO said it raided the Greater London home of the suspect and seized material as part of its investigation.
Aviation authorities in the US, UK, and European Union all issued alerts about AOG Technics earlier this year.
The EU's Aviation Safety Agency said that it suspected the company used false documentation for engine parts of 
an unknown origin.
It left repair shops and airlines scouring their records to find references to AOG Technics.
All three of the major US airlines - Delta, United, and American - are among those who have found parts supplied 
by AOG Technics in their engines.
Some airlines in the US and UK were forced to ground planes because of the scandal. The Independent previously 
reported that at least 100 planes were grounded.
Last week, Ryanair's CEO told Bloomberg that it too had discovered suspect parts during scheduled maintenance 
checks.
Arrest Made in Dodgy Engine Parts Scandal That Affected United, Delta
Southwest was the first major carrier to disclose that it had found parts from AOG Technics in its engines, back in 
September.
"In an abundance of caution, we made an immediate decision to promptly replace those parts on that single 
engine," a spokesperson previously told BI.
The faulty parts were used for CFM56 engines, which power older-generation Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 jets.
Bloomberg reports that the CFM56 is by far the most frequently flown engine, with an aircraft powered by it taking 
off every two seconds around the world.

An individual has been arrested as part of an investigation into AOG Technics, the company accused of supplying 
suspicious engine parts to airlines, the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced Wednesday Dec. 6.
Affected airlines include Tui, Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.
According to Bloomberg, the person in custody is AOG Technics' founder and director, Jose Alejandro Zamora 
Yrala. Business Insider reached out to the SFO for confirmation on this but didn't immediately hear back. AOG 
Technics could not be reached by BI.
"This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the 
consequences of which are potentially far-reaching," said Nick Ephgrave, the SFO director.
"We are determined to establish the facts as swiftly as possible," he added.
The SFO said it raided the Greater London home of the suspect and seized material as part of its investigation.
Aviation authorities in the US, UK, and European Union all issued alerts about AOG Technics earlier this year.
The EU's Aviation Safety Agency said that it suspected the company used false documentation for engine parts of 
an unknown origin.
It left repair shops and airlines scouring their records to find references to AOG Technics.
All three of the major US airlines - Delta, United, and American - are among those who have found parts supplied 
by AOG Technics in their engines.
Some airlines in the US and UK were forced to ground planes because of the scandal. The Independent previously 
reported that at least 100 planes were grounded.
Last week, Ryanair's CEO told Bloomberg that it too had discovered suspect parts during scheduled maintenance 
checks.

Southwest was the first major carrier to disclose that it had found parts from AOG Technics in its engines, back in 
September.
"In an abundance of caution, we made an immediate decision to promptly replace those parts on that single 
engine," a spokesperson previously told BI.
The faulty parts were used for CFM56 engines, which power older-generation Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 jets.
Bloomberg reports that the CFM56 is by far the most frequently flown engine, with an aircraft powered by it taking 
off every two seconds around the world.

FRAUD squad officers investigating a company accused of supplying fake aeroplane parts to airlines around the 
world have arrested a man.
He was being questioned yesterday after his home was searched by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the 
National Crime Agency (NCA).
London-based AOG Technics has supplied parts to airlines around the world but has been accused of selling 
products using fake safety documents. In some cases it has caused aircraft to be grounded, sending carriers and 
manufacturers scrambling to discover whether they are affected.
Ryanair is among those that have discovered fake parts and blamed the British company, while US carriers Delta 
Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also discovered suspect components in their planes.
AOG Technics is also facing legal action by American manufacturer CFM International, after the company's CFM56 
- the world's best-selling jet engine - was said to have been affected. The SFO said that AOG Technics had been 
supplying parts for the CFM56 and the CF6, the most-used cargo aircraft engine, since 2015.
CFM56 engines are used in Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 jets, among others, and some 22,000 are still in 
service globally.
Aviation regulators in the UK, US and Europe have issued alerts to businesses who may have bought AOG's 
products, amid safety concerns.
Serious Fraud Office arrests man in fake aircraft parts investigation
The SFO is working alongside the UK Civil Aviation Authority on the investigation. Nick Ephgrave, the SFO's 
director, said: "This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, 
the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.
The SFO is best-placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts as 
swiftly as possible."
As the scandal unfolded, Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has called for greater scrutiny of third-party jet 
engine suppliers.
AOG Technics could not be reached for comment last night.
Industry sources told Reuters that the parts in question were not considered critical, but nevertheless their presence 
makes it impossible to verify airworthiness. Lawyers for
CFM International and its co-owners General Electric Safran have claimed that AOG Technics used a "deliberate, 
dishonest and sophisticated scheme to deceive the market with falsified documents on an industrial scale".
In filings to London's High Court, they claimed to have uncovered documentary evidence that thousands of jet 
engine parts had been sold by the British company to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with jet engines 
that were made by CFM International.

Fraud investigators have launched an investigation into a company suspected of supplying fake aircraft parts used 
by airlines across the world.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said its investigators carried out a dawn raid at a site in London used by AOG 
Technics and arrested one person who remains in custody.
The UKs Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and its counterparts in the EU and the US issued alerts earlier this year 
warning aviation businesses about unapproved parts sold by the company.
AOG Technics mostly sold to overseas companies that install airline parts but some UK airlines were also affected, 
the SFO said.
It added that some planes have been grounded in the UK and the US.
A spokesman for travel firm Tui confirmed an engine component supplied by AOG Technics on an aircraft the 
groups airlines were sent for leasing was identified and quickly removed before the plane entered service.
Other affected airlines include Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.
SFO director Nick Ephgrave said: This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply 
of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.
The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts as 
swiftly as possible.

The SFO said it is working closely with the CAA and other regulators as part of the inquiry.

British Airways owner IAG nosedives as JPMorgan cuts rating, slashes

British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) and other major European airlines 
slumped after a more cautious view of the airline sector was put forward by JPMorgan, which cut ratings and 
slashed price targets.
Against a backdrop of potentially weaker economic growth, the investment bank highlighted the potential for large 
increases in seat capacity, which could bring revenue per passenger-mile yields down. 
The investment bank prefers low-cost carriers such as Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) to the networks due to 
capacity constraints which could aid pricing. 
It thinks the long-haul supply picture looks more difficult given network capacity increases in particular on 
Transatlantic while lower margins and elevated fuel/ex-fuel cost pressure mean unit revenues are unlikely to grow.  
Balance sheets and valuations do not look overly stretched; however, earnings pressure could send stocks lower, in 
the broker's opinion. 
JPM moved IAG to 'underweight' from 'neutral' and Lufthansa and Air-France KLM to 'underweight' from 
'overweight' with its top sector pick Ryanair - rated 'overweight' - where it noted superior pricing, best-in-class 
margins, and growing net cash.
The broker has nearly halved its price target for IAG to (EURO)1.45 from (EURO)2.80, Lufthansa's target is cut to 
(EURO)7.50 from (EURO)12.00 and Air France to (EURO)9.50 from (EURO)21.50.
British Airways owner IAG nosedives as JPMorgan cuts rating, slashes target
The bank remain 'neutral' on easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ).
Shares in IAG fell 3.6% to 155.65p, Lufthansa fell 4.4% to (EURO)8.20 and Air France dropped 5.9% to 
(EURO)11.92.

Southeast Asia banks on aviation boom
Southeast Asia banks on aviation boom
Financial Services Monitor Worldwide
December 7, 2023 Thursday

Length: 777 words

Major airport expansion projects are taking off across Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and a new airline is set to 
launch next year all banking on an expected boom in air travel in Southeast Asia, fueled by Chinese and Indian 
tourists.
But there are doubts about whether it will materialize in an uncertain economic environment and as worries about 
the impact of travel on climate change deepen.
Thailand's Really Cool Airlines is expected to start flying between Bangkok and Japan around mid-2024, but Chief 
Executive Officer Patee Sarasin a veteran of the region's cutthroat budget sector says it has been a battle to launch 
a new carrier just after a pandemic.
"It's a lot of money. It has been quite grueling to raise the funds," he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).
"There are some points [where you say] 'why am I doing this?' It crossed my mind many, many times."
Patee ran budget carrier Nok Air for more than a decade, but while he is coy about the finer details of the new 
venture, he claims it may yet "change the aviation paradigm."
He added: "Southeast Asia is going to be probably one of the centers of the universe in the future, with the 
slowdown in Europe and in the US."
Flying took a hammering globally during the pandemic as international travel all but shut down, but the industry is 
bullish about its bounce-back, evidenced by a flurry of big-ticket orders at this month's Dubai Air Show and bumper 
profit jumps for the likes of Air France-KLM and Ryanair.
Airport boom
Southeast Asia banks on aviation boom
Southeast Asia is becoming a hot property, with private and public players competing for an expanding market.
The region currently accounts for 10 percent of global traffic more than 500 million passengers in 2019.
And Boeing expects this figure to grow around 9.5 percent a year over the next two decades, well above the global 
average of 6.1 percent.
Across the region from Bangkok to Hanoi, governments are splashing billions of dollars to update and expand 
airport infrastructure.
A new terminal opened at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok's main international airport, in September, and a third runway is 
being built.
There are plans for a third terminal at the city's other airport, Don Mueang, as well as a doubling of capacity at 
Chiang Mai in the north and expansion in the major island tourism hub Phuket.
Cambodia has grand plans to make Phnom Penh's new $1.5-billion airport, expected in 2025, a regional hub to 
compete with Bangkok and Singapore, with about 50 million passengers by 2050.
Further evidence of the kingdom's ambitions came earlier this month with the opening of the new Chinese-funded 
$1.1-billion airport at Siem Reap, the gateway to the Angkor Wat temple complex, Cambodia's biggest tourist draw.
Built as part of Beijing's sprawling "Belt and Road" infrastructure scheme, the Siem Reap airport is designed to 
handle 12 million passengers a year by 2040 double the total number of foreign tourists who visited the country in 
2019.
Philip Kao, president of a Siem Reap tourism association, hailed the new airport as a "game changer" because its 
longer runway means it can handle bigger planes flying long-haul.
But while some are hoping for a tourism bounce back, others are grappling with the environmental impact of the 
construction boom.
Outside Ho Chi Minh City, work on what will be Vietnam's biggest airport, the $15-billion Long Thanh terminal, has 
blanketed nearby neighborhoods in thick red dust.
Turbulence ahead?
Tourist numbers are not yet hitting pre-pandemic highs, and Mayur Patel, Asia director for aviation data consultancy 
OAG, said they are unlikely to do so before late 2024 or early 2025.
"It's fragmented from an economic perspective, but there is a coordinated effort to bring tourism back. Complexities 
will ease out in the years to come," he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).
Thailand, where tourism accounts for around a fifth of gross domestic product, has stepped up measures in recent 
weeks to boost numbers by granting visas on arrival to visitors from China and India two huge reservoirs of 
customers.
Analysts expect growth to be powered by the growing Chinese and Indian middle classes as well as a younger 
generation more keen to travel than their parents.
But OAG warns the region's tourism has sometimes been over-reliant on China, and for now, Chinese visitor 
numbers are still way below pre-pandemic levels as the Asian superpower grapples with a challenging economic 
slowdown.
In Thailand's deep south, Betong International Airport stands as a monument to misguided expansion.
Southeast Asia banks on aviation boom
Opened in 2022 in a remote spot near the Malaysian border, the airport struggled for passengers, and now stands 
idle as airlines halted operations within a few months.

JP Morgan strategists have updated their outlook for European airlines for 2024 and have shown their 
commitment to low-cost airlines. This confidence has taken its toll on IAG, parent company of Iberia, Vueling, 
British Airways and Aer Lingus, which is down around 3% on the Ibex 35.
Other airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa are also suffering in the stock market and are down 5% and 
3.5%, respectively.
Analysts at the US firm have downgraded their recommendation on the three companies to 'underweight' as they 
see potential pressure on profitability in 2024 due to unit revenue concerns over capacity growth. "We are 
16% below EBIT," they remarked.
JP Morgan has become more cautious on the Old Continent's airline sector "given the potential for large capacity 
increases to depress yields against a backdrop of weaker economic growth."
They have also highlighted that the long-haul supply outlook looks more challenging due to increased network 
capacity, particularly for Transatlantic.
" We generally forecast margins down and pressure on fuel/ex-fuel costs is high and unit revenues are 
unlikely to grow," they indicate. "Balance sheets and valuations do not look too tight; however, pressure on earnings 
could drive shares lower," they comment from JP Morgan.
Regarding airlines, the best option for the experts is Ryanair, "with superior pricing, best-in-class margins and 
growing net cash."
JP Morgan has also underlined that it remains 'neutral' on EasyJet, due to tariff risk and disappointing costs, as 
well as on Wizz Air, "on GTF uncertainty".

   MADRID, 7 (EUROPA PRESS9)
   Its preference for low-cost airlines in 2024 is taking its toll on the share prices of both IAG and other European 
airlines such as Air France and Lufthansa. Air France is down 6.9%, Lufthansa -4.9%.
   Analysts believe that within the airline sector, there is potential for large capacity increases to reduce the yields of 
legacy airlines in a context of weaker economic growth. Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair could benefit both in 
terms of margins and growth.
   IAG shares led the Ibex 35 with a fall of more than 3% in the early stages of the day to 1.82 euros in a semi-
holiday climate due to the December long weekend.
   A few days ago, the company regained the 1.80 euro level, from the low of 1.58 euros recorded last October, and 
was looking for the high of 1.99 euros reached last September.
   On December 6, a public holiday, the shares closed at 1.8855 with an increase of 3.57%. IAG has also been 
favored by the fall in the price of oil, as the price of Brent crude oil hit a six-month low yesterday, falling to 74 
dollars.

NI Ryanair passenger brands airline’s denial of e-boarding pass add-on ‘absurd’
NI Ryanair passenger brands airline’s denial of e-boarding pass add-on

A Northern Ireland man has said claims by Ryanair that customers haven’t been required to pay for seating in order 
to download a digital boarding pass on their phone are “absurd”.
There has been confusion after some customers hit out at the budget airline for an apparent change in policy — a 
change the airline denied was in force.
Passengers happy to accept a random seat allocation say they were offered the option of queueing at a Ryanair 
check-in desk to print a paper boarding pass at the airport, or to pay to reserve a specific seat in order to display an 
e-boarding pass on their smartphone.
Previously, those accepting a random seat would have received a free online boarding pass on their phone as well.
However, a spokesperson for Europe’s biggest budget airline, when contacted by the Belfast Telegraph, said: 
“There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass — ever.”
Both e-boarding passes and printed passes are typically offered without a requirement to pay for seat selection by 
most airlines.
One local man, who recently travelled from Dublin to Faro, said he checked in for a flight on Saturday.
“I was surprised to see that I was checked in but a [smartphone] boarding pass was unavailable unless I chose to 
select and pay for a seat,” he said.
He was further advised to “proceed to the Ryanair desk to collect my boarding pass for free, or I could choose a 
seat [and pay] and get an instant boarding pass”.
NI Ryanair passenger brands airline’s denial of e-boarding pass add-on ‘absurd’
He added: “The fact Ryanair are saying in your article they do not charge is absurd — if I wanted it [his boarding 
pass] instantly I had to pay for it.”
The man said he enquired at the desk whether he would be required to go through the same process on the return 
trip and was told by the attendant she wasn’t sure.
“She told me that they are trialling this in some airports but she wasn’t sure which ones,” he explained.
“Clearly they didn’t put a lot of thought into it.”
The issue is still far from clear at present.
A spokesperson for Ryanair said in response: “As per our statement, which this passenger correctly points out, 
there is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass — ever.”
The airline also told media: “All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish, or if passengers 
wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge.”
Queries to the ‘Ask Ryanair’ account on X (formerly Twitter), stated that “due to popularity of reserved seats, 
Ryanair is keeping seats available until the end for those customers wishing to purchase.
“Some passengers will be assigned the last remaining seats at the airport for free.”
The Belfast Telegraph asked Ryanair specifically: can passengers who don’t choose a seat —and who therefore 
avoid the seat fee — also get their digital boarding pass for free on their mobile phone?
So far there has been no response to this question.

Ryanair boarding passes: Everything we know about requirements, extras 
and more

Travel expert Simon Calder said on his Travel Podcast he suspected the practice was a trial designed to drive more 
people towards reserving seats.
It may already have been dropped — although Ryanair has neither confirmed nor denied this.
The airline told Mr Calder there is “no change of procedure in force”.
Here are the key questions and answers about Ryanair check-in and boarding policies as we understand them so 
far.
What’s the background to Ryanair’s check-in requirements?
In 2008, Ryanair became the first airline anywhere in the world to ask passengers to check in online before 
reaching the airport. The aim was to cut costs — drastically reducing the number of travellers who had to see a 
check-in agent at a desk, and commensurately allowing Ryanair to pay less for space at the departure airport.
The option of checking in at the airport has remained available — but at a high cost. The fee started at £10 but 
within a year increased to £40. It is now £55 for each passenger on a booking.
Initially the boarding pass had to be printed out to avoid the charge. This was annoying and difficult for people on 
holiday abroad.
Soon, though, Ryanair aligned with other airlines that allow boarding passes to be carried on mobile phones and 
shown while going through the airport and at the departure gate.
Can I use mobile boarding passes everywhere?
Ryanair boarding passes: Everything we know about requirements, extras and more
No. Ryanair says: “We accept mobile boarding passes on flights from the majority of airports on our network. 
However, unfortunately some airports cannot accept mobile boarding passes yet.”
These airports include Kefalonia in Greece, the Albanian capital Tirana, and all airports in Morocco, Turkey, Israel 
and Lebanon.
Ryanair says: “Customers travelling from these airports must check in online and print out a paper boarding pass 
for their flight.”
Wasn’t there a controversy about airport check-in earlier this year?
Yes. In August, Ryanair was heavily criticised after charging two elderly passengers £110 at London Stansted 
airport, after the couple inadvertently checked in for their inbound rather than outbound flight to France.
At the time, a spokesperson for the airline said: “In accordance with Ryanair’s T&Cs, which these passengers 
agreed to at the time of booking, they failed to check in online before arriving at Stansted airport (August 11) 
despite receiving an email reminder (August 10) to check in online. These passengers were correctly charged the 
airport check-in fee.”
How do travellers avoid charges for extras on Ryanair?
Simply by declining all invitations to pay for extra services and complying with the rules on cabin baggage (carrying 
no more than one small item measuring no more than 40 x 20 x 25cm).
Consider the £15 one-way journey (correct at time of research) from Edinburgh to Shannon on December 11. 
Options offered include:
                                            A 10kg checked bag for an extra £18                       Priority boarding and an additional, 
larger piece of hand luggage for an extra £22                       Fast-track security for £7                       Selecting a seat 
in advance, a minimum of £8                                        
If all these extras were chosen, the fare would increase by £55 — to nearly five times the original price. 
Passengers, though, are able to opt out of all the extras.
What has happened now?
Some passengers who decline the option to book a specific seat in advance, and instead accept random seat 
allocation, say they have been told they cannot use an online boarding pass.
They say they were invited to choose between paying for a specific seat, at which point they could use their 
smartphone, or queue up for a paper boarding pass at a Ryanair desk.
One passenger, Andrew Brown, told The Independent: “Ryanair says that you can check in, but if you want to avoid 
queuing for a free-of-charge printed boarding card at check-in you should pay for a dedicated seat. Then you can 
have your boarding card on your phone as before.”
He speculated: “They’re trying to discourage people from selecting a free random seat. It was brought in without 
notice and there’s nothing on their website about the policy change.
“It puts an end to my practice of taking just hand baggage with no allocated seat and no extras, so just the fare.”
Another passenger, Neil Gregory, told the BBC: “The app said if I opted for a free, random seat I’d have to go to 
check-in to get a paper boarding pass, which I’ve never seen before. If you wanted a digital boarding pass, it said 
you had to pay for a reserved seat.”
The BBC said a traveller was told by staff at the airport check-in desk that the new policy was only for the final 20 
passengers checking in for each flight.
Ryanair boarding passes: Everything we know about requirements, extras and more
On a “random seat assignment” booking for a flight from London Stansted to Italy for December 5, The Independent 
experienced no difficulty checking in online as normal and getting a digital boarding pass on a smartphone.

Body
Ryanair is to start flying to destinations from Norwich International Airport for the first time from next year. The 
budget airline will run services to Malta, Faro in Portugal and Alicante in Spain, according to an aviation analyst 
Sean Moulton.
Mr Moulton shared the news with his 16,600 followers on X, formerly Twitter, along with detailed flight times and 
numbers. He posted screenshots of images showing tickets are not yet on sale but have been uploaded onto 
Ryanair's online system ahead of the new year. Mr Moulton said he expects tickets to be available for purchase 
"soon". 
The budget airline will run flights to Malta, Alicante and Faro on Mondays and Fridays from 1 April as well as a host 
of return journeys. Portuguese destination Faro is a new location for the city airport, which will be provided by a 
6.40pm to 9.40pm outbound or 3.15pm to 6.15pm inbound flight. TUI is currently Norwich Airport's biggest operator 
by destination with nine routes in total, but has regularly attracted criticism in recent years for delays and 
cancellations.
Ryanair is expected to reveal more details of its destinations from Norwich Airport later today (Wednesday 6 
December). It is the first time the carrier has operated from Norwich. Ryanair already operates from three airports 
around London - Gatwick, Luton and Stansted.
The airline pulled out of operating from Southend Airport back in 2021. Norwich Airport currently operates flights to 
18 destinations in nine countries, with connections to 150 more locations via Amsterdam.

Ryanair will add Barcelona-Girona as a fourth destination from Paderborn/Lippstadt Airport in March 2024. The 
flights will operate twice a week and are already available for booking. Girona is known for its medieval buildings, 
walled old town, and Roman fortress remains. The expansion of Ryanair's flight program is seen as a commitment 
to the airport, and the airport director is confident that Barcelona-Girona will be as successful as the existing 
destinations.
Original Press Release:
Dec. 6 -- Paderborn/Lippstadt Airport issued the following news release:
RYANAIR TAKES A FOURTH DESTINATION FROM PADERBORN/LIPPSTADT AIRPORT
Good news for all Spain fans: The airline Ryanair will be adding a fourth destination from Paderborn/Lippstadt to its 
program from March 2024. From Sunday, March 31st, the ship will sail twice a week from its home port to Girona, in 
the immediate vicinity of the metropolis of Barcelona. The flights depart on Fridays and Sundays and can be 
booked now.
Ryanair started in Paderborn/Lippstadt in spring 2023 with Alicante, Mlaga and Palma. The aircraft were very well 
utilized right from the start, so that the globally successful airline will continue to fly to Alicante in the winter of 
2023/2024 and activated the existing flight destinations for the summer half of 2023/2024 at an early stage. Now 
Barcelona-Girona is another very attractive destination.
The Catalan city of Girona, with around 100,000 inhabitants, is known for its medieval buildings, walled old town 
and the remains of a Roman fortress. In addition to Roman, Carolingian and Moorish monuments as well as Gothic, 
Baroque and Modernist buildings, Girona also impresses with its proximity to the Mediterranean and its short 
distance to Barcelona.
"We are very pleased about the expansion of Ryanair's offering at our airport. We see the expansion of the flight 
program as a clear commitment from the airline to our airport. Barcelona-Girona represents a very interesting 
destination that is equally relevant for business and private travelers "I am sure that this destination will be just as 
successful as the existing destinations," emphasizes airport managing director Roland Hser.

Ryanair has said reports it has changed its policy so people have to pay for an online boarding pass are false.
Over the past few days customers have complained that they have had to pay up to 21 for a seat to access a digital 
boarding pass when checking in.
Several told the BBC the only other option was to queue at the airport to collect a paper version.
A Ryanair spokesperson said passengers have never been asked to pay to download boarding passes.
"All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they 
can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge," the spokesperson said.
However, several passengers have complained on social media that if they chose the option of a randomly 
allocated seat they were told they would have to pick up a paper boarding pass at the airport, a problem first 
reported in the Mail on Sunday two days ago.
A series of indignant posts on X, formerly Twitter, have addressed Ryanair directly.
"When and why did you start this carry on? I now have to QUEUE to collect my boarding pass at the airport?" said 
one passenger travelling from London to Belfast early on Monday morning.
Another passenger said: "I just can't believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass 
(mobile or print-out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to do so for no 
other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous."
"This definitely happened to me," Neil Buckley told the BBC. He flew to Riga with Ryanair at the weekend and said 
he felt forced to pay 15.50 for reserved seats - the equivalent of 10% of the ticket price.
Ryanair denies passengers must pay to download boarding pass
"The app said if I opted for a free random seat I'd have to go to check-in to get a paper boarding pass, which I've 
never seen before.
"If you wanted a digital boarding pass, it said you had to pay for a reserved seat. I was really annoyed that I had to 
pay to avoid the inconvenience of queueing at check-in," he said.
Anita Wilczynska, who flew to Krakow last Thursday, said that while checking in online, a message appeared 
informing her she must either collect her boarding pass from the airport, or purchase a seat for an e-boarding pass.
Another traveller on social media said that staff at the airport check-in desk told them the new policy was only for 
the last 20 passengers checking in for a flight, and the charge had been introduced in the past few days.
The BBC has asked Ryanair for further explanation.
Most airlines require passengers to check in online, confirming their intention to travel. Usually you can download 
an electronic copy of your boarding pass at the same time as doing this. Some passengers choose to pick up a 
printed boarding pass at the airport instead. None of those choices usually incur a charge.
However, these Ryanair passengers say they found they had to book a seat, which typically cost between 7 and 21, 
before they were allowed to download their boarding pass. The only alternative, if they chose not to pay to book a 
seat, was to queue for a boarding pass at the airport, they said.
Low-price airlines such as Ryanair have gained a reputation for adding on charges, such as for putting luggage in 
the hold, booking a seat and asking for a seat with extra legroom.
Budget carriers argue that is how they keep basic fares low compared to traditional carriers who usually provide 
meals, baggage and other add-ons within the overall price.
Adding extra optional fees is known as "drip pricing" and can add significantly to the total price.
Recent government research into the issue found these hidden fees were common not only among airlines, but also 
at other travel firms, gyms, restaurants, cinemas and theatres. More than half of firms in the entertainment and 
hospitality industries operate some kind of drip pricing, the research found.
The government recently held a public consultation into drip pricing and whether there should be clearer information 
for consumers.
The consultation closed in October, but the government has not indicated when it will respond.
Ryanair's pricing strategy has already been in the news in recent months, after it charged an elderly couple 110 to 
print their tickets at the airport. They had mistakenly downloaded their return tickets instead of their outgoing ones.
In a second case that hit the headlines, Ryanair charged a family 165 to check in at the airport after it said they had 
"unchecked themselves" even though they turned up at the airport with their printed boarding passes.
Consumer rights expert Martyn James said the latest reports could indicate an error with Ryanair's computer or 
booking systems.
"If this new charge is true, then it's something of a false economy for Ryanair, as they'll need an awful lot more staff 
on the check-in desks to print off all of those boarding passes," he said.
"However, this latest news story highlights a glaringly unfair scenario that's been allowed to continue for far too 
long. Passengers should not have to pay for reserving a 'standard' seat at all. Speedy boarding, more legroom, 
premium - fine. But you should not have to pay to sit next to a loved one."

- RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FLIGHTS TO ALICANTE, FARO & MALTA FROM APRIL 2024
Ryanair, the UK's No.1 airline, today (6th Dec) announced that it will begin operations at Norwich Airport for the first 
time ever this Summer, with 3 exciting new Summer sunshine routes - Alicante, Faro, and Malta - commencing from 
1st April 2024. Norwich will become Ryanair's 22nd UK airport, providing competitive fares, increased connectivity, 
and unbeatable choice to customers in Norwich and the wider Norfolk region who have traditionally been forced to 
pay sky high fares by the high fare carriers who dominate at Norwich Airport. In addition, Ryanair's new Norwich 
operation will drive invaluable inbound tourism for the region and create over 60 local jobs from Summer '24,

Ryanair is the UK's No.1 airline operating over 440 routes and carrying over 52m passengers p.a. to/from the UK 
on its fleet of 107 UK-based aircraft ($10.7bn investment), driving year-round connectivity and inbound tourism 
which supports over 37,000 UK jobs. While competitor airline capacity throughout Europe stagnates, Ryanair will 
continue to grow to carry 300 million passengers p.a. by 2034, as it takes delivery of a further 400 aircraft (incl. 300 
Boeing MAX-10 aircraft) making it the only airline that can deliver real meaningful growth over the next 5 years at 
least.
To celebrate Ryanair's arrival to Norwich, the airline has launched a limited-time seat sale on its 3 new routes 
to/from Norwich with fares for travel from April 2024 until October 2024 from just 29.99, which must be booked by

From 1st April 2024, we will operate 3 exciting new Summer sunshine routes to/from Norwich - Alicante, Faro, and 
Malta. Our new Norwich operation will not only bring competitive fares and a wider selection of Summer routes to 
our customers in Norwich and the wider Norfolk region, but will support important regional development through 
increased connectivity, inbound tourism, and local job creation.
We have worked productively with our new partners at Norwich Airport to agree terms which enable Ryanair to 
deliver this growth and investment for the region, and we look forward to further developing our partnership with 
Norwich Airport and welcoming Norfolk customers/visitors onboard our Ryanair flights to/from Norwich as we 
continue to grow to 300 million p.a. by 2034."
Richard Pace, Managing Director of Norwich Airport, said:
"This is fantastic news for passengers and the first time that Ryanair has flown from Norwich Airport. Alicante, Faro 
and Malta are hugely popular destinations and with twice-weekly flights it means we can offer passengers even 
more great choice from their local airport. We're delighted to be increasing connectivity for local communities and

Ryanair's new routes out of Norwich airport will create more than 60 new jobs and bring more than 60,000 
passengers through the terminal each year, the company has revealed.
The budget airline confirmed it would begin operations at the airport for the first time, with 12 flights a week to and 
from Malta, Alicante, and Faro starting on April 1.
The new jobs created will boost the number of people employed at the airport by around a quarter.
The company said the new routes would also bring more than 60,000 additional passengers to the airport, with 
return tickets currently available to Alicante from 29.99.
It added that the budget-friendly flights would be -exciting- for passengers, who it said had been -forced to pay sky 
high fares by the high fare carriers who dominate at Norwich Airport-.
Ryanair-s head of communication, Jade Kirwan, said: -Our new Norwich operation will bring competitive fares and a 
wider selection of summer routes to our customers in Norwich and the wider Norfolk region, and also support 
important regional development through increased connectivity, inbound tourism, and local job creation.-
Norwich Airport currently operates flights to 18 destinations in nine countries, with connections to 150 more 
locations via Amsterdam.
Journeys to Malta and the Spanish port city Alicante have been previously available with KLM and the now-
dissolved Flybe, but services were cancelled shortly before the Covid pandemic.
The airport said that although passenger numbers had fallen due to the pandemic, they had returned to around 
80pc of their pre-Covid levels, and that the arrival of Ryanair was due to push that up to 90pc.

Ryanair will fly three new routes out of Norwich Airport to desirable Mediterranean destinations from next spring, it 
has been revealed.
The budget airline will run flights to Malta, Alicante and Faro on Mondays and Fridays from April 1, as well as a host 
of return journeys.
Aviation analyst Sean Moulton shared the news with his 16,600 followers on X, along with detailed flight times and 
numbers.
Tickets are not yet on sale but have been loaded onto Ryanair's online system ahead of the new year, screenshots 
show, which Mr Moulton said he expects to be available for purchase "soon".

Norwich Airport currently operates flights to 18 destinations in nine countries, with connections to 150 more 
locations via Amsterdam.
Journeys to Malta and Spanish port city Alicante have been previously available with KLM and the now-defunct 
Flybe, but services were cancelled shortly before the Covid pandemic.
Portuguese destination Faro, however, is a new location for the city airport, which will be provided by a 6.40pm to 
9.40pm outbound or 3.15pm to 6.15pm inbound flight.
Norwich Airport has been contacted for comment and is understood to be close to confirming its first association 
with Ryanair, which flies regularly from Stansted.

Vicky Samwell-Buckenham, manager at Norwich-based agency Oyster Travel, said the routes would only be good 
news for the region.
"People will be over the moon to hear they can fly to these destinations from Norwich Airport again," she said.
"Our customers always love to fly from Norwich and will be happy to continue to support the airport going forward.

She added: "It will be a happy return for those who remember being able to fly to Malta or Malaga with Flybe in the 
past."
Tui is currently Norwich Airport's biggest operator by destination with nine routes in total, but has regularly attracted 
criticism in recent years for delays and cancellations.
The operator announced in September that it would be running a second weekly flight to Tenerife, between October 
and April.

Highlight: Jet2, easyJet and Ryanair have issued travel advice for Brits with Christmas travel plans amidst Met 
Office warnings that further snow and ice could hit the UK later this month
Body
Major airlines have offered passengers advice in the event of winter travel disruption after snow and ice caused 
cancellations this weekend, with the Met Office predicting more to come later this month.
Passengers were left stranded at Glasgow Airport over the weekend when all flight operations were suspended on 
Saturday due to heavy snow. The busy Scottish airport said "winter teams" had worked overnight after "heavier 
than forecast snow". Dozens of flights were cancelled after the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings including 
Scotland, and northern and south-west parts of England. The incident was the first this winter in which snowy or icy 
weather led to disruption at Britain's airports.
Last year Brits heading away for the festive period didn't have to contend with bad weather but with strikes as 
Border Force workers staged walk-outs in December as part of a long running pay dispute. Such action will not 
happen this year. 
Although the RMT Union voted to stop striking last week, festive travellers using the rails may be impacted by the 
strikes targeting 16 train operating companies in England on different days between 2 and 8 December as Aslef 
train drivers continue their campaign of industrial action. 
If you are due to fly over the Christmas period then it is important to check with your airline ahead of the trip to 
check whether there is any weather related disruption. Ryanair, easyJet and Jet2 have advice for Britons travelling 
this month.
Jet2, easyJet and Ryanair issue winter weather advice as Met Office forecasts snow risk
Earlier this week Ryanair urged customers to be aware of "potential disruptions to and from the United Kingdom", 
saying customers who are impacted this week or during the rest of the month would be notified of any changes to 
their flights. Those concerned about disruption "should check their Ryanair app for the latest updates on their flight."
Passengers travelling with easyJet from Luton Airport this month have been advised to take extra car, especially if 
driving to the travel hub.
A statement from the airline said: "Please allow extra time for your journey if you're travelling by road. Following the 
car park fire in October, the drop-off and pick up zone has moved to the Mid-Stay car park. This is a 10 minute walk 
from the Terminal, or a free shuttle bus service is available. Blue Badge holders can be dropped off at Terminal Car 
Park 1. Airport parking is limited so please book this in advance."
Jet2 has said it does not expect any disruptions, but has urged customers to regularly check their flights for any 
changes generally speaking, especially during periods of poor weather. 
Honor Criswick, a meteorologist at the Met Office, told the Mirror that the disruptive weather of the past weekend 
was likely to ease off as the week goes on. 
"There is a risk of snow Wednesday night through to Thursday, probably localised and not near airports, turning 
milder as this week goes on," she said. 
"The only caveat from that is that it will be a lot wetter. There is a further risk of some localised flooding from 
Wednesday onwards. The wind is strengthening a fair amount around the coasts. It will be quite breezy, Thursday, 
Friday and over the weekend as well. 
"From December 12, chance of a cold spell, but it is very uncertain at this time if it could cause impact to air travel, 
but there is always that risk. Perhaps a little bit of disruption."
The national weather service's latest long-range forecast states colder weather is expected to return during the 
festive season. It concerns the period of Wednesday December 20 to Wednesday January 3.
Writing on its website, the Met Office predicted: "Most likely to be unsettled with further bands of rain crossing the 
UK with brighter conditions and showers in between. The wettest and windiest conditions are most likely in the west 
and northwest. The chance of a colder spell of weather, with hazard such as snow and ice, does increase later in 
December and into the New Year period. However, conditions are more likely to remain generally mild and wet."

THE Oxford University Press word of the year is 'rizz', the TikTok generation's term for charm and sexual appeal.
'Revenge spending' was not considered, although it sums up a key post-pandemic trend. There are things on which 
we scrimp, but others on which we will splash out, following the privations of lockdown.
The 18.7pc rise in full-year revenues at online travel agent On The Beach to a record £170.2m shows that revenge 
spending on holidays is going strong.
Shaun Morton, its chief executive, says most consumers are seeking to 'protect - not sacrifice' their break.
Shareholders will be cheered to learn getaways have recovered their rizz, and by the news of a dividend next year.
The figures lifted shares 17.9pc, although they remain 66pc down over three years. The road back to this level may 
be shorter if On The Beach can deploy its tech to disrupt the long haul end of the market.
Another focus will be its battle against what it calls the 'anti-competitive behaviour' of low-cost airlines like Ryanair 
which, it is claimed, block the firm's bookings.
Between On the Beach and Ryanair, there is a distinct lack of rizz. The Competition and Markets Authority should 
intervene to foster a better working relationship.

Prestwick Airport has reported another another profitable year despite challenging economic conditions.
The airport has returned an operating profit of 2.1m - the fourth consecutive year in profit for the facility.
The facility has been hit by the impact of Brexit and a fall in anticipated cargo volumes, but passenger numbers are 
'substantially up' on the previous year.
The airports CEO, Ian Forgie, said: The board and I are pleased with another year of good performance and thank 
all our staff who made it happen.
"We are also pleased to confirm a new five-year agreement with Ryanair and we look forward to working with them 
to grow passenger services.
"The airport remains an important base for Ryanair with an aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul facility on site 
employing over 500 people.
The board is focussed on growing our cargo business and we will continue to invest in equipment and expand our 
facilities to meet demand, building on Prestwicks reputation for fast, efficient and well connected 24/7 cargo 
services.
Glasgow Prestwick continues to provide excellent service to military customers with most nations operating aircraft 
using our facilities, including the Royal Canadian Airforce which recently celebrated its 80th anniversary of its 
connection with Prestwick.
The Airport is also well on its way to achieving its target of 50 per cent percent carbon reduction by 2030, and we 
are also working on supporting the change to sustainable aviation fuel to establish the airport as a key supply point 
for SAF in Scotland.

Our weekly Online Travel Update for the week ending December 1, 2023, is below. This week's Update features of 
variety of stories - resort fees, potential new EU traveler regulations and Ryanair's continued pursuit of OTAs. 
Enjoy.
New Traveler Rights Proposed in EU. Privacy and data security, competition and now, traveler rights . . . Our 
friends at the EU Commission have been busy. The latest from the EU Commission proposes changes to existing 
traveler regulations, including free air travel for those accompanying persons with disabilities, deposit limitations on 
package travel and guaranteed refunds for expired travel vouchers. We will continue to keep an eye on these 
proposed changes in the months ahead.
Add Massachusetts to List of States Seeking to Regulate So-Called Junk Fees. Not to be outdone by her 
contemporaries in California, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell announced this past week 
new regulations requiring hoteliers (and others) to display the 'true' price of a night's stay. The proposed regulations 
will now be the subject of a public hearing on December 20, after which the AG can decide whether to move 
forward with putting the regulations into effect with or without changes coming out of the public comments. My bet is 
on the rules becoming effective.
Ryanair's War with OTAs Continues. In the latest salvo in the ongoing war between Ryanair and OTAs, Ryanair's 
CEO called out those OTAs that allegedly charge travelers 'unjustified fees and charges.' OTAs making the 
illustrious list include Kiwi.com, lastminute.com, Opodo and eDreams. Ryanair went on to accuse the UK's Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of ignoring OTAs' 'rampant internet piracy 
and anti-consumer mis-selling.' Earlier this year, some of the largest OTAs (Expedia and Booking.com) sent letters 
to these same UK authorities accusing Ryanair of 'invasive, unnecessary and unfair treatment' of their customers. 
So, what's the real motivation behind these complaints by Ryanair? Is it simply a bizarre form of direct booking

campaign? Or is someone finally drawing a line with certain OTAs and calling out their practices? Are there lessons 
here for hoteliers?

November 30, 2023 via Boston Globe
Many consumers get an unwelcome surprise when they see a fee tacked on to their online purchase or their hotel 
bill. Examples abound: a $30 'resort fee' added to a lodging bill, a $25 'convenience fee' on concert tickets, a $30 
'upgrade fee' for cell phone service.

Updated: Ryanair steps up campaign against OTAs
November 29, 2023 via Travel Weekly
Ryanair today stepped up its war of words against online travel agencies by listing firms the budget airline claims 
are overcharging consumers. The carrier released data for November identifying Kiwi.com, lastminute.com, Opodo 
and eDreams for adding 'unjustified fees and charges'.

Maria Veronese reports. . Norwich Airport will soon have more flights to and from Europe. Ryanair today announced 
it will be flying from Norwich for the first time from April to the European holiday destinations of Alicante, Faro and 
Malta. We will have 12 weekly flights. 
A really nice schedule. It will be Monday and Friday which if you are a negative way for the weekend, if they want to 
do round-trip they can do that as well. In the past Flybe has tried and failed to make flights from Norwich Airport 
viable but now, post covid, with more people wanting get away. Ryanair has used a bit of blue sky forecasting and 
spotted a gap in the market. We need to look at the regional airports like Norwich and the development and the 
Azores and what we can bring there. That's why we're excited not just to holiday destinations we're looking inward 
as well. The inbound traffic that we're bringing from wider Europe. For the airport and staff and heavy hitter like 
Ryan air will see the creation of 60 jobs and help secure its long-term future. Ryanair will be hoping the 
convenience of using regional airports like this will drive demand with the end it could see them put on possibly 
more routes and flights in future. At the moment we don't know, it's summer only. But if sales are good then I'm sure 
they'll add flights into the winter season for them and we should know that in a few months' time for them is great 
news for them it's not just for the airport I think it's a real vote of confidence in the region both Norwich the city, 
Norfolk the county as well. The new routes are expected to see 60,000 more passengers passed through here next 
year. A project offering free school meals to more than one hundred pupils in the Southwold area of Suffolk could 
be extended.?Teachers say they have already noticed an improvement in children s concentration in lessons. 
Charities are funding the project to help families who are struggling with the cost of living. Dinner time at Southwold 
Primary. Today, roast chicken and all the trimmings. For this and next term school dinners here are free for every 
pupil and at neighbouring Reydon primary school too. I think it's fantastic, I really do. I think it's a really lovely idea.

They children are taken up on it. It's definitely increased. Everyone gets a lovely heart, free meal. I wish it had been 
when my child was here. I would've taken full opportunity of having free school meals. It would've saved me. 
Nationally, nearly 24% of pupils are entitled to free school meals. This pilot scheme has been funded by local 
donations and charities. We hope that school intelligence has been proved, the general health of the child 
improves, that there school concentration in crews and also help their parents are less stressed so they are health 
improved as well. If it goes well and I feel it will and we can raise enough money we want to carry on with the 
project. Certainly in the winter months for that with Ben like to expand it out to other schools in our local area if we 
can. If you have a free school dinner it saves money for your parents and your family. You need the protein and the 
nutrition to concentrate on your schoolwork. It really helps you concentrate if you a full stomach. Teachers have 
already noticed a difference in the classroom. The uptake has been really good. The impact of the children's 
learning in the afternoon, the concentration, they're not worried about being hungry. Sometimes children come in, 
it's been a rush in the morning, it's easy to skip breakfast sometimes that does happen in the reality of everyday life. 
The free school meals pilot is cost #17,000 judging by the number of empty plates it's going down a storm. Richard 
Daniel reporting there. Football now and it was a rollercoaster ride for Luton Town last night. They took on league 
leaders Arsenal and ran them close, but lost to a dramatic late goal. All the details now from our sports reporter 
James Burridge. Lieutenants Kenilworth Road rocking once again. Under lights for the might of arsenal, a seven 
goal thriller and no shortage of drama. Arsenal dominated early on, Martinelli with the open. But Lewton struck back 
five minutes later. I hate her. Restoring arsenals lead nodding in bed wise cross. 2-1 at the break. The second half 
was chaotic. The leagues best defence

ACK in January my new year's resolution was to be more positive, to be a glass half full type of guy. For the most 
part I've succeeded in that aim, but there is no point in being upbeat just for the sake of it and I can't help but think 
that last season's Gold Cup was not the classic we thought it was at the time.
While it is far too early to write of Galopin Des Champs and Bravemansgame, they both look to currently have 
issues. Galopin simply doesn't jump very well anymore. He was sloppy at Cheltenham, sloppy again in the John 
Durkan and on recent evidence he's not as good a horse as Fastorslow, who is a brilliant jumper.
Galopin Des Champs was by no means disgraced at Punchestown on his comeback, but he has gone from looking 
a fast horse to a bit of a slogger in a short space of time. Bravemansgame's performance at Haydock suggested he 
might have an issue. The Betfair Chase turned out to be a moderate affair, with the winning time five seconds 
slower that the previous year, which was run on slower ground according to the Going Stick.
Bravemansgame didn't finish off his race at all and will need to improve stones on that form to have any shot of 
winning the King George again.
Paul Nicholls has pulled bigger rabbits out of his hat in the past, so it's not totally beyond the realms of possibility 
that he could bounce back, but he looks an awfully short price on what he's shown this season. Judged on what 
Stage Star showed at Cheltenham in the Paddy Power, he is the pre-eminent chaser in the Nicholls yard, but he's 
not entered at Kempton. However, I wonder whether the trainer wishes he was when he snuggles under his electric 
blanket at night.
Before, during and after last year's Cheltenham Festival the feeling was that the Turners was by far the weakest of 
the four novice chases run, but that doesn't look the case now with the first two home filling the same places in the 
Paddy Power and the fourth,
Stage Star currently sitting at the top of the chasing tree
Appreciate It, split Fastorslow and Galopin Des Champs in the John Durkan.
The Turners was given another boost of sorts in the Coral Gold Trophy at the weekend. The winner Datsalrightgino 
was firmly put in his place by Stage Star in a handicap at Cheltenham last season, and while he improved for the 
step up to staying trips on Saturday, the only possible conclusion is that Stage Star is as good a chaser as there is 
around.
The plan appears to be the Ryanair, where he will bump into Allaho, and while many are hyping up the Jonbon-El 
Fabiolo Champion Chase rematch, it could be the Ryanair is the race of the festival come March.

Waterford Airport seeking Ryanair service

SARAH SLATER  Waterford Airport is understood to have engaged in preliminary discussions with Ryanair 
following the announcement that up to EUR 30million is to be invested in a runway extension.
A joint private investment of EUR 12 million is to clear the skies for the much-anticipated return of commercial 
flights in and out of Waterford Airport for the first time since 2016.
The joint investment being made by Comer Group International and existing investors Bolster Group could see 
flights to the UK in general resuming by the end of next year. Any deal with Ryanair would likely be some time 
away.
A business plan is to be submitted to the Department of Transport this week, in a bid to secure matching funding. 
Local authorities Waterford City and County Council along with Kilkenny County Council are also expected to 
provide funding. The total amount of funding could top EUR 30 million. The Government has yet to decide whether 
it will provide funding.
The new runway will have the capacity to service large and mid-range airliners, such as the widely-used Airbus 320 
and Boeing 737. Backers hope to see Waterford Airport linking up with summer and winter holiday destinations 
across Europe. London is expected to be the first destination, possibly at the end of next year.
 Attractive destination Minister for Finance Michael McGrath made the announcement in Waterford last 
Friday. He said that an extension to the runway would make the southeast an  increasingly attractive 
destination for both leisure and business travellers and, similarly, it will make it easier for people across 
the region to travel internationally .
He pointed out that the multimillion-euro investment has the potential to boost economic growth in the region in the 
decade ahead and complement significant investment already planned for Waterford including in urban 
regeneration and the southeast Technological University.
Waterford Airport opened in 1981, with Ryanair operating its first scheduled flight four years later. In its final year of 
commercial flight operations seven years ago, the facility handled 13,511 passengers. The Irish Coast Guard Air 
and Sea Rescue helicopter is based at the airport.
Waterford Airport seeking Ryanair service
Speaking on WLRFM, the main shareholder at Waterford Airport, William Bolster, said:  We have no control over 
airlines. We re only the airport, the infrastructure   which is very important. Ryanair has said that once we deliver the 
runway, they ll happily talk to us. 
Mr Bolster revealed that Waterford Airport is also in discussions with other airlines, and that it attracted interest from 
private investors before a deal was struck with the Comer brothers.

O n the Beach Group exceeded £1 billion of sales for the first time as holidaymakers enjoyed the post-Covid 
phenomenon of "revenge travel" (Dominic Walsh writes).
The concept was dreamt up on social media to describe the surge in demand for overseas holidays after the end of 
lockdown.
The result for the online travel agent was a jump in total transaction value for the year from £849.4 million to a 
record £1.07 billion, while group revenue increased by 18.7 per cent to £170 million.
The company was, however, hit by wildfires and other disruptive events.
Adjusted pre-tax profit soared by 66 per cent to £23.6 million.
On the Beach recently won a £2 million payout from Ryanair over flight cancellations and said that it would be 
pursuing the airline for further sums relating to refunds made after the initial claim.
Shaun Morton, 41, who recently replaced the founder Simon Cooper, 51, as chief executive, said the signs for the 
coming year were positive.
Shares in On the Beach rose by 21p, or 17.9 per cent, to 138½p. 6MAG Group, the owner of Manchester and 
Stansted airports, reported operating profits of £218 million in the six months to the end of September on revenues 
24 per cent higher at £705 million. Both airports have returned to prepandemic levels with Manchester handling 
16.4 million passengers in the period and Stansted 15.8 million.

Authorities in London have arrested one person as they investigate the sale of unapproved aircraft parts that have 
turned up in the fleets of several major airlines.
The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said Wednesday that the arrest and seizure of material came during a raid of an 
address in London.
The agency said that it launched a new investigation into fraud at London-based AOG Technics Ltd., which for 
several years has supplied aircraft businesses with parts for popular jet engines produced by CFM International.
Earlier this year, aviation authorities in Europe, the U.K. and the United States warned businesses about the AOG 
parts and asked them to check the origin of parts supplied by AOG.
Suspected unapproved engine parts have wound up at Ireland’s Ryanair, TAP Air Portugal, Virgin Australia and 
several U.S. carriers including American, United, Delta and Southwest, according to published reports.
Fake or unapproved parts have plagued the aviation industry for years, with authorities blaming greed on the part of 
suppliers and poor oversight by regulators.
In some cases, the parts are counterfeits, akin to knockoff handbags. In other cases, they are mislabeled, 
paperwork may be forged, or used parts are passed off as new ones.

History, culture and operatic street life combine to make Palermo, Sicily's capital, a compelling, captivating city. 
Centuries of foreign rule have left an indelible mark on the city's fabric, which has a distinct East-meets-West feel

Autumn is a great time to explore its fascinating back streets as they return to full speed after the summer torpor

48 Hours In: Palermo
Palermo sits on Sicily's north-west coast, overlooked by the dun-coloured ridge of Monte Pellegrino. The historic 
centre, which extends north from the station (2) and contains most of the main sights, is made up of four quarters: 
La Kalsa, Albergheria, Capo and Vucciria. These are divided by the north-south Via Maqueda and the east-west 
Corso Vittorio Emanuele, which crosses it at a point known as the Quattro Canti (4), the "four corners". Running 
parallel to Via Maqueda, Via Roma is another important thoroughfare.
To the north, the 19th-century "new town" is the city's main shopping district. For free city maps, the main tourist 
office (5) is at Piazza Castelnuovo 34 (00 39 091 605 8351; www.provincia.palermo.it/turismo ; 8.30am-2pm and 
2.30-6pm weekdays only). There's also a tourist office at the airport (8.30am-7.30pm weekdays and 8.30am-2pm 
Saturdays).

Richard Wagner supposedly completed his opera Parsifal at the Grand Hotel et Des Palmes (6) at Via Roma 398 
(00 39 091 60 28 111; amthotels.it/despalmes ), a stately 19th-century pile with a grandiose Liberty-style lobby and 
elegant carpeted rooms. Doubles with breakfast start at €145.

For more modest digs, the friendly Hotel del Centro (7) at Via Roma 72 (00 39 091 617 0376; hoteldelcentro.it ) has 
bright, classically styled rooms and an excellent location between the train station (2) and Quattro Canti (4). 
Doubles start at €65, including breakfast.

                     Day one                   
                     Take a hike                   
Start off at Palazzo Reale (9), aka Palazzo dei Normanni, at Piazza Indipendenza 1 (00 39 091 626 2833; 
federicosecondo.org ; open 8.15am-5.40pm and to 1pm Sunday; €8.50). Now seat of Sicily's regional government, 
this muscular Norman palace is home to the Cappella Palatina, a lustrous 12th-century chapel bedecked in gold 
mosaics. From the palace duck under the nearby Porta Nuova (10), and push on to the Cattedrale (11), Corso 
Vittorio Emanuele (cattedrale.palermo.it ; open 9am-to 5.30pm daily; free), whose hybrid Arab-Norman architecture 
incorporates crenellations and cupolas.
Continue on Corso Vittorio Emanuele to the Quattro Canti (4) intersection flanked by four Baroque façades. Turn 
right on to Via Maqueda and, on your left, you'll see the Fontana Pretoria (12), a lavish fountain of tiered basins and 
naked nymphs. Nip through to Piazza Bellini, home to two of Palermo's best-known churches – La Martorana (13), 
now sadly closed behind scaffolding, and the Chiesa Capitolare di San Cataldo (14) (9.30am-12.30pm and 3-6pm 
daily; €2.50).
                     Lunch on the run                   
Taste Palermo's local delicacies at the Touring Café (15) on Via Roma 252 (00 39 091 322 726; 6am to 11pm), 
which serves fabulous fist-sized arancini (fried rice balls; €1.50) and daily specials such as vegetable couscous 
(€5).
                     Window shopping                   
48 Hours In: Palermo
No trip to Palermo would be complete without trawling through a neighbourhood market. The Mercato del Capo 
(16), Via Sant'Agostino (open 7am-8pm daily except Sunday, to 1pm Wednesday) is one of the most characteristic, 
with groaning food stalls squeezed into the Dickensian alleyways of the Capo area.
For a more relaxed experience, there's Sapori e dei Saperi della Legalità (17) at Piazza Castelnuovo 13 (00 39 091 
757 4861). Browse the gourmet goodies, all of which have been produced on land confiscated from the mafia. 
Good buys include extra-virgin olive oil, wine and honey.
                     An aperitif                   
Join Palermo's refined café-goers for an early-evening drink at the Antico Caffè Spinnato (18), Via Principe di 
Belmonte 107-115 (00 39 091 749 5104; spinnato.it ). This polished café in the heart of the busy shopping district 
has outside tables where you can sit back and people-watch over chilled Corvo white (€4.20) or granita di gelsi 
(€4.50), an ice drink flavoured with black mulberries.
                     Dine with the locals                   
On a hidden piazza in the shabby Vucciria district, Ristorante Santandrea (19), Piazza Sant'Andrea 4 (00 39 091 
334 999; ristorantesantandrea.eu ; open dinner only Monday to Saturday) is a smart choice for creative seasonal 
cuisine that features tagliata di tonno con cipolla in agrodolce (tuna with sweet and sour onion). Reckon on from 
€35 per person for a full meal without wine.
More traditional in style is Ristorantino da Spano (20), Piazza Sant'Anna al Capo (00 39 348 562 8789; 
ristorantinospano.it ; closed Monday), a family-run trattoria in the tourist-free area behind the cathedral. Try the 
fettuccine alla tarantina (€6) with mussels and tomatoes.
                     Day two                   
                     Sunday morning: Go to church                   
One of Palermo's finest churches is the graceful Chiesa di San Francesco d'Assisi (21) (open 6.45am-noon and 4-
6.30pm daily) on pint-sized Piazza San Francesco d'Assisi. It sports a solemn Gothic with striking rose window and 
dramatic main portal. Inside, there's the sumptuous Cappella dell'Immacolata right of the altar. Sunday Mass is at 
7.30am, 10am, noon and 5.30pm.
                     Out to brunch                   
Just over the piazza, Antica Focacceria di San Francesco (22), Via Paternostro 58 (00 39 091 320 264; 
bit.ly/BrunchPal ), specialises in classic Sicilian snacks. Its signature dish is pani ca' meusa (€2.50), a roll filled with 
beef spleen served from a large steel cauldron. If that doesn't appeal, go for ricotta-filled cannoli (€2). It opens at 
midday, daily in summer, Wednesday to Monday at other times.
                     Cultural afternoon                   
Palermo's streets are almost deserted on Sunday afternoons so pay a visit to the Galleria d'Arte Moderna (23), Via 
Sant'Anna 21 (00 39 091 843 1605; galleriadartemodernapalermo.it ; open 9.30am to 6.30pm daily except Monday; 
€7 or €11 if there's an exhibition on), a lovely museum showcasing modern Sicilian art in a beautifully restored 15th-
century palazzo.
Another option is Teatro Massimo (1) (00 39 091 605 3262; teatromassimo.it ), Palermo's landmark opera house. 
Here you can take a guided tour (9am to 5pm daily except Monday; €8) or catch a matinee.
                     A walk in the park                   
Down by the seafront, Villa Giulia (24), Via Abramo Lincoln (open 8am to 8pm), is a historic 19th-century 
landscaped park with shady lanes and landscaped gardens.
48 Hours In: Palermo
Next door, there's the Botanical Garden (25), Via Abramo Lincoln 2b (00 39 091 238 91 236; ortobotanico.unipa.it ; 
open 9am to 7pm; €5) where fig trees and palms grow alongside cacti, coffee plants, papaya and bamboo.
                     The icing on the cake                   
South-west of Palermo, the Duomo di Monreale, Piazza Duomo, a sober Norman cathedral (open 8.30am to 
12.45pm and 2.30-5pm Monday to Saturday, 8-10am and 2.30-5pm Sunday; free) is one of Sicily's great 
masterpieces. It's decorated with sumptuous mosaics with gold designs on upper walls depicting biblical scenes. 
The adjacent cloisters (open 9am to 7pm Tues-Sat, until 1.30pm Sun and Mon; €6) are worth a look.
To get to Monreale take bus No 389 from Piazza Indipendenza (26). Buy tickets (€2.60 return) at the kiosk by the

I couldn't have had him at the start of the season but Pagaille is now my top

NEARLY every horse entered in the Ladbrokes King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day has a question to 
answer and I wouldn't want to take a short price about anything at this stage.
A couple of weeks ago I wouldn't have been saying that because I thought last year's winner Bravemansgame 
made a perfectly satisfactory return in the Charlie Hall at Wetherby. However, he was downright disappointing at 
Haydock last time. He beat Royale Pagaille easily in the King George last year but was brushed aside by that rival 
in the Betfair Chase, so I really don't want to be backing him now at the same price he was when he won last year.
If Gerri Colombe and Allaho travel from Ireland, I'd expect Bravemansgame to be a bigger price than he is now, 
although I'm not entirely convinced by either of the Irish stars around Kempton.
Allaho did nothing to suggest he was anything like the force of old on his reappearance at Clonmel. It was a slowly 
run three-runner race and he just had to get round to win, which he did unimpressively. He's an amazing talent at 
his best but after his problems it's open to question whether he can get back to his previous level.
Gerri Colombe is a different kettle of fish because he seems destined for the top and did well to beat three Grade 1 
winners at Down Royal on his comeback. He's not slow by any means and I reckon he's going to be a tough nut to 
crack if he turns up, although it has to be said his form hasn't exactly worked out well and I doubt Kempton would 
be his ideal track.
He couldn't quite get past The Real Whacker at Cheltenham in March and, while the time of his Aintree win is solid, 
the form isn't and I think his reputation exceeds his achievements. That's not to say he can't or won't win the King 
George or the Cheltenham Gold Cup, just that he's priced up on what he might do.
Next there's Shishkin and it's anyone's guess what he's going to do these days. He has the talent to win, of course 
he does, but he didn't win the Ryanair in March when he should have, he gave up the ghost in the Champion Chase 
I couldn't have had him at the start of the season but Pagaille is now my top pick ANTE-POST PRICEWISE
the year before when a shortpriced favourite and, worst of all, he refused to race last time. He has a good record at 
Kempton and if his head's in the game he can win, but that has to be a huge doubt.
The Real Whacker has to bounce back from being pulled up in the Paddy Power and not many, if any, land the King 
George on the back of that sort of preparation, while
L'Homme Presse has been off since jumping badly right in the race last year.
Consequently, the only one to back at this stage has to be the Betfair Chase winner Royale Pagaille, who beat the 
King George joint-favourite easily there and was second in this race last year. That run came on the back of a poor 
preparation and Racing Post Ratings suggest his Haydock run was his best ever.
If that's the case it puts Royale Pagaille right in there with the best of these and he won't mind what the conditions 
are come Boxing Day. I wouldn't have dreamed of him winning the King George at the start of the season but, given 
the concerns about nearly all the others, I can't see him being out of the frame now.

ROBBIE POWER spoke of a fantastic horsewoman who was as tough as old boots, Barry Geraghty praised her 
positivity and ability to infuse confidence into those all around her, while Shane Foley hailed a fantastic woman who 
was fantastic to work for.
They were, of course, talking about the most successful female trainer in the history of the sport, who brought 
everyone to their feet as she made her way up to the stage at the Mansion House in Dublin to collect her 
contribution to the industry award.
As contributions go, they don't get much more generous than the donation made by Jessica Harrington. She has 
spent the last few decades smashing glass ceilings and, not only doing things that women had never done before, 
but most men too.
There was also talk of the "odd bollocking" from both past and present stable jockeys to which Harrington giggled: 
"Well, it didn't do them any harm, did it?"
This was a night of celebration in the Round Room of the Mansion House, where the Irish government used to sit 
and debate between 1919 and 1921. It's doubtful any of those debates were as intense as the one that Michael 
O'Leary and Davy Russell had over a cup of tea at Punchestown all those years ago and during a magnificent 
montage of the recently retired rider, there was certainty a hint of an admission from the Ryanair boss that he might 
have regretted getting rid of him back in 2014.
Russell became the latest recipient of the Irish racing hero award, adding his name to an illustrious roll of honour 
that includes the likes of Pat Smullen and Ruby Walsh.
Gordon Elliott hailed Russell one of the greatest of all time, before adding: "He brought a lot of owners into the 
place, but he also drove a lot out as well," which brought the loudest laugh of the whole night.
Harrington sparkles as legends are honoured Deputy Ireland editor David Jennings reports from the HRI 
Awards night on Monday
The Dungarvan trainer John Kiely is looking younger with every passing year and his first Cheltenham Festival 
winner at the age of 85 was recognised with the National Hunt achievement award.
JP McManus said of Kiely: "I can't think of anybody who deserves it more. He's very understated and an absolute 
pleasure to deal with."
It was A Dream To Share who opened Kiely's festival account in the Weatherbys Champion Bumper under 
teenager John Gleeson, who picked up the emerging talent award. That ride was described as "textbook" by Ruby 
Walsh, who presented him with the trophy. Rich praise from the greatest.
Amy Jo Hayes said she "couldn't talk" such was her shock as picking up ride of the year for her front-running 
masterclass on Redstone Well in a premier handicap at Leopardstown, but for somebody lost for words she 
somehow managed to have everyone in stitches. We need more Amy Jo Hayes in this world.
We nearly didn't have Wesley Joyce still in this world. There were more than a few moments when we thought we 
had lost him on that dark day at Galway during last year's summer festival when a horror fall from Red Heel left him 
fighting for his life. It was a battle he looked like losing for a long time.
"It's just great to be here," whispered Joyce, as he proudly held the Flat achievement award in his hand on the 
stage.
His main employer Johnny
Murtagh told us about a "loveable rogue" and by all accounts Joyce is the cheekiest of young chaps.
Paul Townend ended his awards hoodoo when he was a most deserving winner of the National Hunt award, while 
Barry O'Neill, a seven-in-a-row champion hailed by point aficionado Richard Pugh as someone he would love his 
kids to grow to be, won the point-topoint award.
The racecourse of the year was Ballinrobe. No argument here. Indeed, few could argue with any of the award 
winners. It has been some year for Irish racing.

Highlight: This Boeing 747-8 is the world's biggest private jet and takes travelling in style to a whole new level – 
boasting gold-trimmed bedrooms and stunning bathrooms, it's a far cry from flying economy
Body
The world's biggest private jet has been dubbed the 'Flying Mansion' and has everything you need to start any 
luxury getaway in style.
If flying economy doesn't float your boat, this luxury Boeing 747-8 might be more up your street. It boasts multiple 
spacious living and dining rooms as well as multiple bedrooms, including a master suite.
This swanky boudoir has the utmost privacy as it sits right under the plane's nose and the cockpit, far from loud 
engines and the other bedrooms – making it a much better place to join the mile-high club than your favourite 
budget airline's toilet.
                                            For more of the latest news from the Daily Star, click here.                   
These closed-off living quarters feature a large bed in the middle of the room which is kitted out in high-quality 
materials for the ultimate night's sleep, reports The Sun.  It also has plenty of storage space, so don't worry about 
packing light.
The bedrooms also feature en-suite bathrooms covered in mirrors and decorated with wooden furnishings and gold 
trim. A golden staircase leads from the master bedroom up to the main living area, lined with colour-coordinated 
bookshelves, artwork on the walls and plush sofas to relax on a long-haul flight.
A separate living area also features three couches, perfect for unwinding over games or drinks after a long day of 
premium flying.

While it boasts plenty of space, the plane doesn't scrimp on style. Materials like exotic wood can be found 
throughout and the entire vehicle is kitted out with touchscreen-controlled lights to make sure the mood is always 
set.
The Boeing 747-8 was first flown in November 2005. With a wingspan of 224ft, the enormous jet can hold up to 467 
passengers at a time – more than twice the capacity of a RyanAir plane.
Sound like your cup of tea Unfortunately – and unsurprisingly – the plane will set you back a fairly hefty sum. The 
jet is owned by real estate tycoon Joseph Lau, whose net worth is thought to be more than £10.3billion, according 
to simpleflying.com.

The Independent Technical Commission (CTI) argues that the aviation regulator should have more powers to set 
airport charges. In practice, this means that ANA - Aeroportos de Portugal would lose power compared to the 
current status quo.
"One of the recommendations we are making is that the model for regulating charges should be more in the hands 
of the regulator than in the exclusive hands of the concessionaire," Raquel Carvalho, one of the CTI's seven 
members, said on Tuesday.
"This is a function of the regulator and introduces more transparency into this financing model," she added, during 
the event to present the CTI's conclusions for the location of Lisbon's new airport, which took place on Tuesday.
"The moment of renegotiation of a contract for airport expansion is perhaps the ideal moment for this issue to be 
regulated in a more up-to-date way in the concession contract, if it is maintained, or in any other [contract] that may 
be made, if that is the political option, which we don't know what it will be," added the professor at the Faculty of 
Law of the Portuguese Catholic University.
Currently, ANA - Aeroportos de Portugal presents its proposal and then the National Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC) 
decides whether to accept it or change the amount. At the moment, the regulator is evaluating the fees proposed by 
ANA for next year.
ANA intends to increase rates as follows in 2024: Lisbon (17%), Faro (12%), Porto (11%), Ponta Delgada (9%), 
Funchal (6%).
The proposal on the table has been widely criticized by the airline Ryanair, which announced in November that it 
will cancel one of its two planes in Madeira from January 2024 and reduce flights to Porto and Faro in the summer 
of next year.
The Independent Technical Commission (CTI) has concluded that Alcochete is the best location to host the new 
airport in the Lisbon region.
The group of independent experts believes that the Air Force's Alcochete Shooting Range is the most suitable 
location to replace Humberto Delgado airport.
CTI's choice as the "most advantageous solution for an intercontinental hub" was Humberto Delgado Airport + 
Alcochete Shooting Range.
However, when the Alcochete airport with two runways opens, Lisbon airport will close.
Airport charges. CTI argues that the regulator should gain powers and ANA should lose them
This option provides for two runways, with a capacity for 80 movements per hour and the possibility of expanding to 
four runways. 5,550 people exposed to noise. 40 kms from Lisbon, about 40 minutes. No railroad. Initially, it was 
planned to build a third crossing over the Tagus for a rail link. One of the advantages is that the land belongs to the 
state.
"The Alcochete Shooting Range is a public space and is closer to Lisbon. Vendas Novas involves expropriation," 
said CTI leader Maria do Rosário Partidário.
She recalled the process of building Lisbon's current airport in the 1940s. "There were two sites: Campo Grande 
and Portela. They thought Portela was the best solution, but it was too far from the city center. Distance is relative 
and changes over time."
Between December 6 and January 19, the public and institutional consultation period will take place on the 
Aeroparticipa.pt portal.
The Vendas Novas location was the second choice to build a new airport in the Lisbon region. The first is the 
Alcochete Shooting Range.
The "other viable solution" is for Humberto Delgado airport to remain open until Vendas Novas opens, with at least 
two runways.
The government announced on Tuesday that it will impose the "immediate execution" of works at Lisbon airport.
The announcement was made by António Costa: "the resolution of the council of ministers will impose on ANA the 
immediate execution of the works that are lacking".
These include the south pier, remodeling and expansion of Terminal One, among other obligations, said the Prime 
Minister in a speech during the presentation of the CTI's conclusions.
The aim is to improve flight sequencing and increase Lisbon airport's capacity, including "removing the Terminal 1 
apron from military use" so that the airport concession can be "fully used by civil aviation".
"The contract negotiating committee will be appointed, but we won't wait" for the decisions "for the works to be 
carried out", warned the Prime Minister.
"The Portuguese state will not leave for nowhere, nor will ANA," he said, predicting that the negotiation will be 
"lengthy" and that "nothing justifies further delay".

investigation into AOG Technics Ltd, the company accused of supplying unauthorised plane engine parts to major 
international carriers.
 AOG Technics was accused in September of a "deliberate, dishonest and sophisticated scheme" to supply 
unauthorised engine parts that ended up in Boeing aircraft.
Lawyers of jet engine maker CFM International told the High Court how AOG potentially sold thousands of engine 
components using forged paperwork, causing Virgin Australia (ASX:VAH), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and 
United Airlines to ground some aircraft when the news came to light.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) was caught up in the scandal earlier this month after reporting the discovery of 
unauthorised aircraft components in two engines.
Barrister Matthew Reeve KC of Quadrant Chambers said there was "compelling documentary evidence that 
thousands of jet engine parts have been sold by (AOG) to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with the 
claimants' jet engines."
Little is known about AOG.
According to Companies House filings, the company has one director, Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, who is also 
listed as a director at Sunwave Solutions Ltd and Kensho Group, the former of which dissolved earlier this year.
Arrest made over 'fakes on a plane' scandal
AOG has taken down its website since the 'fakes on a plane' scandal came to light, while Zamora Yrala does not 
have an active LinkedIn profile.
Nick Ephgrave QPM, director of the Serious Fraud Office, said: "This investigation deals with very serious 
allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far reaching.
"The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts 
as swiftly as possible."
The SFO has not disclosed the name of the individual under arrest.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) on Wednesday raided an address and arrested one person as part of a probe 
into an aircraft parts supplier that serviced several major airlines.
Investigators are looking into UK-based AOG Technics Ltd, which has supplied parts for the world's best-selling 
passenger aircraft engine (CFM56) and most-used cargo aircraft engine (CF6) since 2015. 
The parts, which investigators believe may have been non-certified, were mostly sold to overseas companies that 
install airline parts, and to UK airlines, maintenance providers and parts suppliers, the SFO said in a statement.
Aviation authorities in the UK, Europe and the United States have issued alerts to businesses who may have 
bought or installed AOG's parts, resulting in some planes being grounded.   
"This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the 
consequences of which are potentially far reaching," said Nick Ephgrave, director of the SFO.
"The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts 
as swiftly as possible," he added.
CFM56 engines are used on the previous generation of the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft.
Airlines affected include Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Virgin 
Australia Airlines.

Highlight: Ryanair is among the companies sold engine components with false safety documents
Body
Fraud squad investigators investigating a company accused of supplying fake aeroplane parts  to airlines around 
the world have arrested a man. 
The man was being questioned on Wednesday after his home was searched by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) 
and the National Crime Agency (NCA).
London-based AOG Technics has supplied parts to airlines  around the world, but has been accused of selling 
products using fake safety documents.
In some cases it has caused aircraft to be grounded, sending carriers and manufacturers scrambling to discover 
whether they are affected.
Ryanair is among those that have discovered fake parts and blamed the British company, while US carriers Delta 
Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also discovered suspect components in their planes.
AOG Technics is also facing legal action by American manufacturer CFM International, after the company’s CFM56 
– the world’s best-selling jet engine – was said to have been affected.
The SFO said AOG had been supplying parts for the CFM56 and the CF6, the most-used cargo aircraft engine, 
since 2015.
CFM56 engines are used in Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 jets, among others, and some 22,000 are still in 
service globally.
Aviation regulators in the UK, US and Europe have issued alerts to businesses who may have bought AOG’s 
products, amid safety concerns.
Man arrested by fraud squad investigating fake aircraft parts scandal
The SFO is working alongside the UK Civil Aviation Authority  on the investigation.
Nick Ephgrave, the SFO’s director, said: “This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the 
supply of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far reaching.
“The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts 
as swiftly as possible.”
As the scandal unfolded, Michael O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair , has called for greater scrutiny of third-party jet 
engine suppliers.
AOG could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
Industry sources told Reuters that the parts in question were not considered critical, but nevertheless their presence 
makes it impossible to verify airworthiness.
Lawyers for CFM and its co-owners General Electric Safran have claimed that AOG used a “deliberate, dishonest 
and sophisticated scheme to deceive the market with falsified documents on an industrial scale”.
In filings to London’s High Court, they claimed to have documentary evidence that thousands of jet engine parts 
had been sold by the British company to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with CFM jet engines.

The boss of a firm at the centre of a fake plane parts scandal has been arrested as part of a major criminal fraud 
probe.
Police arrested Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, director of aircraft parts supplier AOG Technics, at his London home 
yesterday morning.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and National Crime Agency (NCA) launched an investigation into the business 
after bogus components were found in planes.
The company has been in business since 2015 and supplied parts for CF56, the world's best-selling passenger 
aircraft engine. 
But the firm is accused of providing fake authentication certificates, raising concerns over safety.
SFO director Nick Ephgrave said: 'This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply 
of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.'
He said the SFO would be 'vigorous' with its investigation and 'establish the facts as swiftly as possible'.
Ephgrave told Bloomberg: 'We are now going through front doors, making arrests and seizing properties.'
AOG Technics could not be contacted for comment.
Last week Ryanair became the latest airline to confirm dodgy parts had been found in two of its planes. 
Serious Fraud Office arrests company boss as it launches probe into jet engine scam
The discovery was made during maintenance checks carried out in Texas and Brazil in the past few months. The 
parts, which were found in two of Ryanair's Boeing planes, have been removed, the company said.
US carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have become caught up in the scandal which 
has resulted in planes being grounded. 
The SFO investigation is the first criminal action since regulators were alerted to fake parts found in Boeing and 
Airbus planes earlier this year. 
Aviation watchdogs traced the supplies back to AOG Technics, an obscure London-based firm. Regulators in the 
UK, US and Europe accused the company of supplying engine parts with faked certification documents.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority announced in August that it was 'investigating the supply of a large number of 
suspect unapproved parts' that could be traced back to AOG Technics.
It issued a safety notice warning airlines that some of the parts were used in engines fitted in UK planes. Operators 
and owners were told to investigate their records for parts bought directly or indirectly from the firm.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency also said in August that it was examining reports of parts with 
suspected falsified documents.
The US Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines about the scandal and Bloomberg has reported that the US 
Justice Department is in the early stages of a probe.

December 6th, 2023 ( International Business Times News  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Major airport expansion projects are taking off across Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and a new airline is set to 
launch next year -- all banking on an expected boom in air travel in Southeast Asia, fuelled by Chinese and Indian 
tourists.
But there are doubts about whether it will materialise in an uncertain economic environment and as worries about 
the impact of travel on climate change.
Thailand's Really Cool Airlines is expected to start flying between Bangkok and Japan around mid-2024, but CEO 
Patee Sarasin -- a veteran of the region's cutthroat budget sector -- says it has been a battle to launch a new carrier 
just after a pandemic.
"It's a lot of money. It has been quite gruelling to raise the funds," he told AFP.
"There are some points (where you say) 'why am I doing this?' It crossed my mind many, many times."
Patee ran budget carrier Nok Air for more than a decade, but while he is coy about the finer details of the new 
venture, he claims it may yet "change the aviation paradigm".
Flying took a hammering globally during the pandemic as international travel all but shut down, but the industry is 
bullish about its bounceback, evidenced by a flurry of big-ticket orders at this month's Dubai Air Show and bumper 
profit jumps for the likes of Air France-KLM and Ryanair.
Southeast Asia is becoming a hot property, with private and public players competing for an expanding market.
The region currently accounts for 10 percent of global traffic -- more than 500 million passengers in 2019.
And Boeing expects this figure to grow around 9.5 percent a year over the next two decades, well above the global 
average of 6.1 percent.
Southeast Asia Banks On Aviation Boom
Across the region from Bangkok to Hanoi, governments are splashing billions of dollars to update and expand 
airport infrastructure.
A new terminal opened at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok's main international airport, in September, and a third runway is 
being built.
There are plans for a third terminal at the city's other airport, Don Mueang, as well as a doubling of capacity at 
Chiang Mai in the north, and expansion in the major island tourism hub Phuket.
Cambodia has grand plans to make Phnom Penh's new $1.5 billion airport, expected in 2025, a regional hub to 
compete with Bangkok and Singapore, with about 50 million passengers by 2050.
Further evidence of the kingdom's ambitions came earlier this month with the opening of the new Chinese-funded 
$1.1 billion airport at Siem Reap, the gateway to the Angkor Wat temple complex, Cambodia's biggest tourist draw.
Built as part of Beijing's sprawling "Belt and Road" infrastructure scheme, the Siem Reap airport is designed to 
handle 12 million passengers a year by 2040 -- double the total number of foreign tourists who visited the country in 
2019.
Philip Kao, president of a Siem Reap tourism association, hailed the new airport as a "game changer" because its 
longer runway means it can handle bigger planes flying long-haul.
But while some are hoping for a tourism bounceback, others are grappling with the environmental impact of the 
construction boom.
Outside Ho Chi Minh City, work on what will be Vietnam's biggest airport, the $15 billion Long Thanh terminal, has 
blanketed nearby neighbourhoods in thick red dust.
Tourist numbers are not yet hitting pre-pandemic highs, and Mayur Patel, Asia Director for aviation data 
consultancy OAG said they are unlikely to do so before late 2024 or early 2025.
"It's fragmented from an economic perspective, but there is a coordinated effort to bring tourism back. Complexities 
will ease out in the years to come," he told AFP.
Thailand, where tourism accounts for around a fifth of gross domestic product, has stepped up measures in recent 
weeks to boost numbers by granting visas on arrival to visitors from China and India -- two huge reservoirs of 
customers.
Analysts expect growth to be powered by the growing Chinese and Indian middle classes -- as well as a younger 
generation more keen to travel than their parents.
But OAG warns the region's tourism has sometimes been over-reliant on China, and for now Chinese visitor 
numbers still way below pre-pandemic levels as the Asian superpower grapples with a challenging economic 
slowdown.
In Thailand's deep south, Betong International Airport stands as a monument to misguided expansion.
Opened in 2022 in a remote spot near the Malaysian border, the airport struggled for passengers, and now stands 
idle as airlines halted operations within a few months.

The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and its counterparts in the EU and the US issued alerts earlier this year 
warning aviation businesses about unapproved parts sold by the company.
AOG Technics mostly sold to overseas companies that install airline parts but some UK airlines were also affected, 
the SFO said.
It added that ``some planes have been grounded in the UK and the US''.
A spokesman for travel firm Tui confirmed an engine component supplied by AOG Technics on an aircraft the 
group's airlines were sent for leasing was ``identified and quickly removed'' before the plane entered service.
Other affected airlines include Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.
SFO director Nick Ephgrave said: ``This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the 
supply of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.
``The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts 
as swiftly as possible.''
ARREST OVER ALLEGED FAKE PLANE PARTS SCAM
The SFO said it is working closely with the CAA and other regulators as part of the inquiry. end

Major airport expansion projects are taking off across Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and a new airline is set to 
launch next year - all banking on an expected boom in air travel in Southeast Asia, fuelled by Chinese and Indian 
tourists.
But there are doubts about whether it will materialise in an uncertain economic environment and as worries about 
the impact of travel on climate change.
Thailand's Really Cool Airlines is expected to start flying between Bangkok and Japan around mid-2024, but CEO 
Patee Sarasin - a veteran of the region's cutthroat budget sector - says it has been a battle to launch a new carrier 
just after a pandemic.
"It's a lot of money. It has been quite gruelling to raise the funds," he told AFP.
"There are some points (where you say) 'why am I doing this?' It crossed my mind many, many times."
Patee ran budget carrier Nok Air for more than a decade, but while he is coy about the finer details of the new 
venture, he claims it may yet "change the aviation paradigm".
Flying took a hammering globally during the pandemic as international travel all but shut down, but the industry is 
bullish about its bounceback, evidenced by a flurry of big-ticket orders at this month's Dubai Air Show and bumper 
profit jumps for the likes of Air France-KLM and Ryanair.
– Airport boom –
Southeast Asia is becoming a hot property, with private and public players competing for an expanding market.
The region currently accounts for 10 percent of global traffic - more than 500 million passengers in 2019.
And Boeing expects this figure to grow around 9.5 percent a year over the next two decades, well above the global 
average of 6.1 percent.
Southeast Asia banks on aviation boom
Across the region from Bangkok to Hanoi, governments are splashing billions of dollars to update and expand 
airport infrastructure.
A new terminal opened at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok's main international airport, in September, and a third runway is 
being built.
There are plans for a third terminal at the city's other airport, Don Mueang, as well as a doubling of capacity at 
Chiang Mai in the north, and expansion in the major island tourism hub Phuket.
Cambodia has grand plans to make Phnom Penh's new $1.5 billion airport, expected in 2025, a regional hub to 
compete with Bangkok and Singapore, with about 50 million passengers by 2050.
Further evidence of the kingdom's ambitions came earlier this month with the opening of the new Chinese-funded 
$1.1 billion airport at Siem Reap, the gateway to the Angkor Wat temple complex, Cambodia's biggest tourist draw.
Built as part of Beijing's sprawling "Belt and Road" infrastructure scheme, the Siem Reap airport is designed to 
handle 12 million passengers a year by 2040 - double the total number of foreign tourists who visited the country in 
2019.
Philip Kao, president of a Siem Reap tourism association, hailed the new airport as a "game changer" because its 
longer runway means it can handle bigger planes flying long-haul.
But while some are hoping for a tourism bounceback,others are grappling with the environmental impact of the 
construction boom.
Outside Ho Chi Minh City, work on what will be Vietnam's biggest airport, the $15 billion Long Thanh terminal, has 
blanketed nearby neighbourhoods in thick red dust.
– Turbulence ahead? –
Tourist numbers are not yet hitting pre-pandemic highs, and Mayur Patel, Asia Director for aviation data 
consultancy OAG said they are unlikely to do so before late 2024 or early 2025.
"It's fragmented from an economic perspective, but there is a coordinated effort to bring tourism back. Complexities 
will ease out in the years to come," he told AFP.
Thailand, where tourism accounts for around a fifth of gross domestic product, has stepped up measures in recent 
weeks to boost numbers by granting visas on arrival to visitors from China and India - two huge reservoirs of 
customers.
Analysts expect growth to be powered by the growing Chinese and Indian middle classes - as well as a younger 
generation more keen to travel than their parents.
But OAG warns the region's tourism has sometimes been over-reliant on China, and for now Chinese visitor 
numbers still way below pre-pandemic levels as the Asian superpower grapples with a challenging economic 
slowdown.
In Thailand's deep south, Betong International Airport stands as a monument to misguided expansion.
Opened in 2022 in a remote spot near the Malaysian border, the airport struggled for passengers, and now stands 
idle as airlines halted operations within a few months.

Fraud investigators have launched an investigation into a company suspected of supplying fake aircraft parts used 
by airlines across the world.
The Serious Fraud Office  (SFO) said its investigators carried out a dawn raid at a site in London  used by AOG

Body
Fraud investigators have launched an investigation into a company suspected of supplying fake aircraft parts used 
by airlines across the world.
The Serious Fraud Office  (SFO) said its investigators carried out a dawn raid at a site in London  used by AOG 
Technics and arrested one person who remains in custody.
The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority  (CAA) and its counterparts in the EU and the US issued alerts earlier this year 
warning aviation businesses about unapproved parts sold by the company.
This investigation deals with very serious allegations
Nick Ephgrave, SFO
AOG Technics mostly sold to overseas companies that install airline parts but some UK airlines were also affected, 
the SFO said.
It added that “some planes have been grounded in the UK and the US”.
A spokesman for travel firm Tui  confirmed an engine component supplied by AOG Technics on an aircraft the 
group’s airlines were sent for leasing was “identified and quickly removed” before the plane entered service.
Other affected airlines include Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.
SFO director Nick Ephgrave said: “This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the 
supply of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.

“The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts 
as swiftly as possible.”
The SFO said it is working closely with the CAA  and other regulators as part of the inquiry.

Highlight: Firm sold to overseas companies that install airline parts but some UK airlines were also impacted
Body
A man has been arrested after a London  firm was accused of supplying fake aircraft parts used by airlines across 
the world. 
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said its investigators carried out a dawn raid at a site in London used by AOG 
Technics and arrested one person who remains in custody.
The firm mostly sold to overseas companies that install airline parts but some UK airlines were also impacted, the 
SFO said in a statement. 
It added that “some planes have been grounded in the UK and the US”.
AOG Technics has been accused of supplying falsely documented parts for use in the world's most-sold passenger 
jet engine, the CFM56.
CFM56 engines power the previous generation of Boeing  737s and about half the previous generation of Airbus 
A320s.
Earlier this year, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority  (CAA) and its counterparts in the EU and the US issued alerts 
warning businesses about unapproved parts sold by AOG Technics. 
Affected airlines include Tui, Ryanair , American Airlines , Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.

The suspected forgery came to light after reports made by a Portuguese maintenance company in June.

I'd like to thank Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Risch, and the members of this committee for the opportunity to 
testify today. I ask that my full remarks be entered into the record.
Transnational repression defined
Transnational repression occurs when states reach across borders to silence dissent from activists, journalists, and 
others living in exile. Perpetrator states do so using intimidation and violence. This issue presents a direct threat to 
rights and security around the world, including here in the United States, and will require a coordinated response 
from across the US government and between the United States and other democratic governments.
From 2014 through 2022, Freedom House has collected information on 854 direct, physical incidents 
(assassination, kidnapping, assault, detention, or deportation) of transnational repression around the world, 
committed by 38 governments in 91 countries. During this time, 13 states have engaged in assassinations abroad, 
and 30 have conducted renditions.
These numbers are likely only the tip of the iceberg, as states also use indirect tactics to intimidate activists in exile, 
such as the use of spyware, surveillance, threats sent over social media or phone, or threats against family 
members back home (known as coercion by proxy).
The top five perpetrators in our assessment are China, Turkey, Tajikistan, Egypt, and Russia--while Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, Iran, Belarus, and Rwanda round out the top ten. These ten countries are responsible for 80 percent of 
the cases in our database. And China, which conducts the most comprehensive and sophisticated campaign of 
transnational repression, is responsible for 30 percent of the cases.
In the last several years, these countries have undertaken brazen measures to intimidate and silence their exiles 
and diasporas. One of the most famous cases in the United States involves the Iranian regime's plot to kidnap 
journalist and women's rights activist Masih Alinejad from her home in Brooklyn. When that didn't work, Iran 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Michael Abramowitz, President, ....
attempted an assassination plot that was thankfully also unsuccessful. To this day, Alinejad lives under federal 
protection.
Just weeks ago, a group of activists were physically assaulted in San Francisco during the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) Summit while protesting human rights violations by Xi Jinping and the ruling Chinese 
Communist Party. In 2021, Belarusian officials called a fake bomb threat into a Ryanair flight from Greece to 
Lithuania, forcing an emergency landing in Minsk in order to apprehend a blogger critical of the ruling regime. Only 
thirteen months ago, Emirati law enforcement arrested Egyptian-American activist and former Egyptian army officer 
Sherif Osman based on a request from Egypt. Russian journalists Elena Kostyuchenko and Irina Babloyan were 
poisoned in late 2022, possibly in connection with their critical reporting on Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Throughout 2022, Tajikistan's government expanded its campaign of transnational repression against members of 
the Pamiri ethnic group, securing the extradition from Russia of outspoken Pamiri activists such as Oraz and Ramzi 
Vazirbekov.
This does not mean that only authoritarian governments are responsible for incidents of transnational repression. In 
September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada's security services had intelligence 
linking "agents of the government of India" to the June murder of Sikh activist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh 
Nijjar in British Columbia. And on November 29, the Department of Justice alleged in an indictment that an Indian 
national in India was hired by an Indian government official to orchestrate the assassination of a US citizen who is a 
Sikh activist.
An old but growing problem
In some ways, transnational repression is a new term for an old problem. As long as states and leaders have seen 
themselves as threatened by dissent outside their borders, they have tried to control that dissent, and sometimes 
have resorted to coercion to do so. There are legions of historical examples, from the murder of Iranian exiles in 
Europe after the revolution to the car bomb murder of Orlando Letelier in Washington, DC by Chilean government 
agents.
What has changed is the dynamic between those who leave and the states they leave behind, and with it the scale 
and scope of transnational repression. The increased scale of global migration has knit our world closer together as 
more people move across borders and build lives in different countries. It should also be recognized that more and 
more activists and journalists are being driven from their home communities by authoritarian powers closing down 
space for them to operate freely. In Russia alone, hundreds of journalists and activists have fled Vladimir Putin's 
crackdown, setting up operations to continue their work in Georgia, Armenia, Germany, Lithuania, and other 
countries in Europe and Eurasia, all while remaining politically engaged in their origin states.
Digital technology has enabled exiled individuals and groups to remain connected to their origin countries, posting 
on social media and messenger apps that reach people within milliseconds instead of arduously smuggling physical 
samizdat across borders. States, in turn, have gained instantaneous capabilities to surveil their overseas critics 
through social media monitoring and spyware. That surveillance all too often leads to concrete threats against those 
living in the diaspora.
One of the most recent and worrying developments is the extraterritorial repression of reporters. As the space for 
free media and dissent has closed in authoritarian countries, governments are increasingly reaching outward to 
target exiled journalists who continue to do their courageous work from abroad. Our new report released today, 
titled A Light That Cannot Be Extinguished: Exiled Journalism and Transnational Repression, examines this issue 
more closely and describes the repressive toolkit used against target exiled journalists and media. At least 26 
governments have targeted journalists, and 112 of the 854 cases in our database - thirteen percent of all cases - 
involved journalists.
Perpetrator states of transnational repression are innovating even as awareness of the problem in host countries 
grows. Moving forward, host governments and law enforcement must pay increasing attention to the role of 
diplomatic staff and proxy actors working on behalf of origin states to intimidate exiles. The aforementioned recently 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Michael Abramowitz, President, ....
unsealed DOJ indictment alleging a murder-for-hire scheme organized by an Indian government employee against 
a Sikh activist in New York City points to the involvement of criminal associates in such plots. Additionally, foreign 
governments, such as that of China, may continue to seek out private investigators to co-opt host state institutions 
and more easily reach targeted individuals.
For too long, democracies have missed or allowed the actions of authoritarian countries inside their borders. Such a 
pattern of impunity has emboldened states to act abroad without fear of consequences.
A global threat to rights and security
When we see the Russian government for years get away with killing its opponents abroad in baroque schemes 
across Europe; when we see the murder of Jamal Khashoggi literally inside Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate go 
unpunished; when we see the Turkish government boast officially that it has kidnapped over 100 people from 
abroad without any consequence; when we see Rwanda kidnap regime critic Paul Rusesabagina off of a Dubai 
tarmac; when we see armed Iranian agents visiting the house of journalist Masih Alinejad in Brooklyn; when we see 
an Indian government agent plotting to murder a Sikh activist in New York City; we have a global problem. 
Transnational repression poses a threat to both rights and security and a challenge for both domestic and foreign 
policy.
The impact of transnational repression on targeted individuals is severe. People's physical safety is endangered, 
their travel is complicated, their houses are surveilled in the US and elsewhere, they are harassed online and 
offline, and communication with family and friends living in the country of origin is fraught. Some people are cut off 
from their families entirely. Each individual incident of transnational repression produces ripple effects throughout 
the community, fostering an atmosphere of fear and suspicion among neighbors and compatriots.
Even when taking care to avoid being impacted by transnational repression, individuals may still face imprisonment 
and the possibility of deportation. To take one example, Idris Hasan, a Uyghur activist, has been in a Morocco 
prison for two-and-a-half years after he was detained upon arrival on the basis of a since invalidated INTERPOL 
notice requested by China. Hasan's detention in Casablanca was particularly unfortunate, as he had opted to flee 
Turkey due to the uptick in pressure from the Turkish government on outspoken Uyghurs.
The fundamental question is whether democratic societies can and will protect the rights of people inside our 
borders against such intimidation. The bet that autocrats are making is that we are not willing to bear the cost of 
doing so. We must prove them wrong.
Progress so far
Transnational repression is part of a pattern of authoritarian powers seeking to globalize the repression they use to 
maintain control in their own societies. Thankfully, there has been strong, bipartisan interest in addressing this issue 
here in the United States and a growing interest from democracies in Europe and elsewhere.
The Biden Administration has made addressing transnational repression a priority issue across agencies. We are 
pleased to see strong interagency coordination, and, as we understand it, increasing engagement between the 
Executive Branch and the Hill - something crucially important for an effective US response.
Among the steps taken by the US government: The Commerce Department has moved to rein in the use of 
American technology in the production of powerful commercial spyware, which is a crucial vector of transnational 
repression. The State and Treasury departments have sanctioned perpetrators of transnational repression. State 
has been holding trainings for diplomats, engaging with allies around the world, and coordinating emergency 
responses for diaspora communities and exiles abroad. The Department of Homeland Security has pursued 
outreach to vulnerable communities inside the US. The FBI has a dedicated stream of work on transnational 
repression, including a public web page, the issuance of several informational bulletins for targeted communities, 
and the ability for individuals to report transnational repression to the FBI hotline. And, we have seen the 
Department of Justice investigate and prosecute a growing number of cases of transnational repression plotted 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Michael Abramowitz, President, ....
against US persons, sending a powerful signal to perpetrators and their agents that these actions will be caught and 
punished.
There are also a number of bills pending in Congress, including some authored by members of this committee.
These are all important steps that we and others have encouraged, and we applaud these efforts. But, more action 
is needed.
Recommendations for Congress
We urge Congress to strengthen the US response to transnational repression and ensure the US has the tools 
needed to protect those within our borders for years to come. There are three specific steps Congress can take.
1) Pass legislation to address gaps in the US government's response to transnational repression. This includes 
codifying a definition of transnational repression, ensuring government officials who may encounter perpetrators or 
victims of transnational repression receive the training necessary to recognize and respond to the problem, and 
strengthening sanctions authorities to make it easier to hold perpetrators accountable. The Transnational 
Repression Policy Act, which was introduced by Senators Merkley, Rubio, Cardin, and Hagerty, includes provisions 
in all these areas. We urge its passage.
At present, US law does not include a definition of transnational repression, which makes it impossible for officials 
to sufficiently respond. A definition is important to allow officials to understand what transnational repression is and 
to direct their agencies on reporting, training, and sufficient outreach to and support for victims and potential targets. 
Codification of a definition for foreign policy purposes in Title 22 should include a detailed description that explains 
the full scope of transnational repression tactics. Any updates to Title 18, which deals with crimes and criminal 
activity, should be narrowly tailored to ensure US criminal law can sufficiently address transnational repression 
without inadvertently criminalizing benign activities or enabling the targeting of individuals simply due to their 
country of origin. Congressman Schiff has introduced legislation that would update Title 18 with additional 
authorities related to transnational repression.
Some agencies and bureaus have provided training for officials. But, trainings are not yet routinized or mandated 
for all officials or employees who may come in contact with perpetrators or victims. Establishing agency-wide 
trainings for all officials who may encounter the issue will help the US government respond more effectively.
On the sanctions front, the United States possesses a number of targeted sanctions options, including the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act; the authorities provided in section 7031(c) of the annual Department of 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act; the Khashoggi Ban visa restrictions, and 
several country-specific sanctions programs. With the exception of the Khashoggi Ban, however, none of these 
sanctions programs explicitly address transnational repression, and they cover only the most severe cases of 
transnational repression, such as murder or kidnapping. And while the Khashoggi Ban addresses transnational 
repression directly, it only imposes visa bans--a weaker measure than the asset freezes included in other sanctions 
mechanisms. It is also a policy implemented voluntarily by the Biden Administration, meaning future administrations 
would not be legally required to screen visa applicants for activity related to transnational repression.
2) Establish clear pathways for exiled human rights defenders to receive permanent legal status when needed. 
Democratic governments should consider appropriate mechanisms, including providing special visas, such as 
humanitarian visas or visas for human rights defenders, activists, and journalists, to help them receive legal status. 
Countries should also review their asylum processes to ensure that exiled human rights defenders, activists, and 
journalists are not being denied legal status as a result of illegitimate criminal charges leveled against them by 
origin country governments. Permanent legal status offers a better safeguard against transnational repression by 
making the protection of a democracy permanent, reducing a human rights defender's reliance on identification 
documents from their home country (which can often be cancelled or put them at risk when needing to enter 
consulates or embassies of their original country for renewal), and potentially allows family reunification, which 
reduces the risk of coercion by proxy.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Michael Abramowitz, President, ....
3) Urge the Executive Branch to continue to raise transnational repression as a priority issue with partners and 
allies. We commend US leadership in the newly launched G7 Rapid Response Mechanism Working Group on 
Transnational Repression and for signing the Declaration of Principles to Combat Transnational Repression. In 
addition to these efforts with like-minded governments, the United States must not hesitate to raise this issue 
directly at the highest levels with perpetrators of transnational repression, even when those perpetrators are close 
partners such as Saudi Arabia and India. Transnational repression is a violation of rights and sovereignty and 
breaks the bond of trust that must exist for deep cooperation between nations. Whether a government engages in 
transnational repression should be a significant factor determining the nature of bilateral relations and the closeness 
of any partnership.
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.

INTRODUCTION
1. My name is Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC. I am a barrister (King's Counsel) at Doughty Street Chambers, London, 
specialising in human rights and media law. My clients are based around the world: I regularly act for individuals 
targeted by countries such as China, Russia, Saudia Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea. Many of my clients are 
journalists, human rights defenders, peaceful protestors and other individuals who have been targeted by State or 
non-State actors and subject to other forms of reprisal, including arbitrary detention and threats to their life, because 
of they seek to vindicate their internationally protected rights or the rights of others, or to expose the unlawful 
conduct of individuals, government, and/or corporations.
2. I am an expert in journalists' safety and accountability for crimes against journalists. My caseload includes 
leading the international legal teams for pro-democracy activist and publisher Jimmy Lai, imprisoned in Hong Kong; 
for the bereaved family of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, assassinated in Malta; for over 150 BBC News 
Persian journalists, subjected to transnational repression by Iran; and (with my colleague Amal Clooney) for Maria 
Ressa, the Nobel Peace Prize winning journalist in the Philippines. I was appointed an expert by the Inter-American 
Court of Human Rights on the safety of female journalists (Jineth Bedoya Lima v. Colombia) and I have given 
expert testimony to UNESCO and Parliamentary inquiries in the Council of Europe, United Kingdom and Council of 
Europe.
3. Increasingly in my work I see a trend of States no longer being content to simply target critical voices within their 
own jurisdictions: now, they are using the long arm of the State to target their critics, wherever in the world they may 
be. We now live in a world in which journalists can be forcibly brought within jurisdiction by hijacking a Ryanair 
place, as Belarus did in order to arrest Roman Protasevich; in which a journalist from the US is brutally 
dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, a Council of Europe country, as happened to Jamal Khashoggi; in 
which Russia poisons its critics in London; and in which journalists and human rights activists worldwide receive 
online death threats from State-linked actors.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Caoilfhionn Gallagher, Internat....
4. I would like to thank the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for inviting me to give testimony today about this 
vitally important issue of transnational repression. In the available time I wish to focus upon two countries, Iran and 
China, and two stark examples which illustrate new trends in transnational repression which I see in my work: (i) the 
extraterritorial targeting of Iranian journalists worldwide; and (ii) transnational repression and reprisals against those 
supporting Jimmy Lai, the renowned pro-democracy campaigner, media owner and writer imprisoned in Hong 
Kong. This Committee's work in support of and solidarity with Mr Lai, a remarkable and brave man imprisoned for 
standing up to a bully regime, has been commendable. Today we highlight secondary, transnational targeting of 
those who stand up to that bully regime outside Hong Kong, including in particular Jimmy Lai's son, Sebastien, and 
his international legal team.
5. These examples illustrate that the nature of the threats faced by those who speak truth to power is changing - 
and the actions we take to combat those threats must change, too, and change urgently.
IRAN'S TARGETING OF JOURNALISTS GLOBALLY
6. It's often said that journalists don't want to become the story. But given Iran's actions, today we must discuss 
journalists' stories.
7. Iran has a long history of targeting journalists on its own soil - arresting them and accusing them of espionage 
simply for doing their jobs. For decades these tactics were used against local journalists; or foreign journalists when 
based there, such as Jason Rezaian for the Washington Post. Iran targeting journalists is not new, but there are five 
developments which are particularly troubling:
(i) Iran's tactics are now cross-border: no longer is Iran only targeting those who report on its own soil, but it is 
routinely using the long arm of the State to reach out across borders, to attempt to silence journalists based in UK, 
in Europe, in the US, worldwide. In their sights are media organisations such as BBC News Persian (UK); Iran 
International (UK and US); Voice of America (US); Deutsche Welle (Germany); Radio Farda (Czech Republic); and 
individual freelancers. Iran attempts to silence these journalists both through 'lawfare', weaponizing Iranian laws: 
accusing media organisations and journalists of terrorism offences and freezing their assets; and through a range of 
extra-legal tactics, including online harassment.
(ii) Many of Iran's transnational attacks on journalists are gendered and misogynistic: women journalists face 
especially egregious tactics. In my work for BBC News Persian, for example, I see false and defamatory information 
generated through different online platforms and domestic and state-controlled media, aided by search engine 
manipulation of search engines, so that it can be very difficult to separate facts from fakes. This includes fake 
images, often focusing on discrediting the female members of BBC News Persian staff among their friends and 
family - and the broader public - in Iran by accusing them of sexual indecencies. Examples include:
. Fake stories stating that a BBC News Persian presenter had been raped by a colleague known to Iranian 
audiences and a fake photo blog showing her with her "illegitimate child". Later, her father was interrogated by 
authorities, where officers told him she had hidden it from her family because she was embarrassed about having 
been raped by a colleague.
. A presenter was photo shopped into a pornographic image, which was sent to her 14-year old son in London. This 
is particularly threatening in that it demonstrates they know where he goes to school.
(iii) Iran's tactics also constitute a collective punishment of those connected to those journalists: their family 
members and their sources. Family members have passports confiscated, are subject to travel bans, and are 
harassed in an effort to silence their relatives. Clients of mine, based in the UK, have family members in Iran who 
are imprisoned, placed in solitary confinement, and given a chilling message: this will continue unless your loved 
one stops working for the BBC, or Iran International. This is weaponising family members against their loved ones: 
leveraging the fact that they have loved ones within Iran to exert pressure upon journalists outside.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Caoilfhionn Gallagher, Internat....
(iv) Iran is engaging in unprecedented collective punishment of journalists. Simply being connected to a media 
organisation which they are targeting is enough. For example, the Iranian authorities in 2017 issued an injunction 
naming over 150 people, current and former members of BBC News Persian staff, simply because of that 
connection, including those who never appear in front of a screen and never work on political reporting. This is a 
legal dragnet, capturing all in its path.
(v) And now, Iran's conduct against journalists has escalated to include routine and regular credible threats to life in 
multiple countries across the globe. For five years, the temperature has been rising, with a series of escalating 
deeply troubling incidents.
. First, we saw deeply troubling individual examples since 2018:
- In October 2018 Denmark recalled its ambassador from Tehran after its security services accused Iranian 
intelligence service of plotting an assassination on Danish soil.
- In December 2019 a complaint was made to the UN concerning credible death threats made to Rana Rahimpour, 
a BBC News Persian presenter in London. She addressed the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2020, 
saying she had been warned that she, her husband, her children and her parents would be assassinated within one 
month. Her crime? Being a journalist.
- Ruhollah Zam, a journalist and refugee in France was effectively kidnapped by Iran. In October 2019, the 
Revolutionary Guard announced that they had lured him back to Iran (he is believed to have attended a meeting 
with a fake source) and arrested him. He was executed in December 2020. His crime? Being a journalist.
- In July 2021, it was revealed that an Iranian-American journalist based in Brooklyn, Masih Alinejad, was the target 
of a kidnapping plot, with four individuals charged. This year, it was revealed that the FBI had disrupted another plot 
to assassinate her.
. Now, these individual examples have morphed to become a systematic tool in the Iranian authorities' global 
toolbox. (This pattern has been analysed brilliantly by journalist Paul Caruana Galizia in a series for Tortoise, 
Londongrad. n1) By February 2023, the UK's security services, MI5, had revealed that UK authorities had 
discovered at least fifteen "potential threats" since January 2022 to "kidnap or even kill British or UK-based 
individuals perceived as enemies of the regime." That's over one a month. And also in February 2023, channel Iran 
International had to suspend its broadcasts from the UK as it was no longer possible to protect the staff at their 
building in London, following credible threats to multiple staff members. A foreign State had caused such a 
significant threat to British journalists on British soil that they had to stop their work and move their operations. Their 
crime, in Iran's eyes? Being journalists.
TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION AND REPRISALS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WORK CONCERNING HONG KONG
8. Transnational repression by the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities is not new but is undoubtedly on the 
increase, and the tactics being used are becoming more sophisticated. This includes increasingly sophisticated 
cyber tactics n2 and alleged interference with parliamentary democracy in sustained and complex ways. n3 We are 
now seeing an increasingly blurred line between transnational repression tactics used in respect of mainland China 
and those used in respect of Hong Kong, and increasingly brutal tactics being used by the Hong Kong authorities.
9. The passing of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region ("the National Security Law" or "NSL") marked a particularly low point. n4 It was 
passed by China's top legislature, unanimously, on 30th June 2020, without accountability or transparency, and it 
entered into force in the territory that same day. In June 2020, shortly before it was passed, an unprecedented 
statement from over 50 UN experts was issued, expressing their alarm about the repression of fundamental 
freedoms in China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ("HKSAR"), stating that, if passed, the NSL 
would "impose severe restrictions on civil and political rights" in the HKSAR, and would "deprive the people of Hong 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Caoilfhionn Gallagher, Internat....
Kong... the autonomy and fundamental rights guaranteed to them" under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 
"one country, two systems" framework. n5 Amnesty International's summary encapsulates the core concerns:
"The law is dangerously vague and broad: virtually anything could be deemed a threat to "national security" under 
its provisions, and it can apply to anyone on the planet." n6
10. From the outset the Hong Kong authorities have, unsurprisingly, threatened the use of the NSL extra-territorially 
and have been using it to threaten their critics abroad. An example from March 2022: Benedict Rogers, CEO of UK-
based organisation, Hong Kong Watch, was threatened with prosecution under the NSL for the publication of 
certain material on the organisation's website. n7
11. Little wonder that, after the passing of the NSL, a number of States suspended their extradition agreements with 
Hong Kong in order to protect individuals from the politically-motivated charges under the NSL. n8 In March 2022 
the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute ("IBAHRI") called on the international community to 
suspend extradition treaties with Hong Kong "amid alleged intimidation by Hong Kong authorities of human rights 
defenders." n9
12. In July 2023, however, there was a very grave escalation by the Hong Kong authorities. On 3rd July 2023, Hong 
Kong authorities issued arrest warrants and HK$1 million bounties on eight exiled pro-democracy activists and 
former lawmakers: Ted Hui, Dennis Kwok, Nathan Law (former legislators); Anna Kwok, Elmer Yuen, Finn Lau 
(activists); Christopher Mung (a trade unionist); and Kevin Yam (a lawyer). They are based in various countries, 
including the UK, USA and Australia. The Hong Kong authorities allege that they have "committed serious crimes 
endangering national security, advocated sanctions, undermined Hong Kong, and intimidated Hong Kong officials," 
and "schemed for foreign countries to undermine Hong Kong's financial status." All of the suspects have been 
charged with "colluding with foreign forces" under the NSL, save for Mr Mung, who faces one charge of "inciting 
secession." Rewards were offered for information leading to their arrests.
13. On 4th July 2023, Chief Executive John Lee said that the eight would be "pursued for life" and told journalists 
that, "the only way to end their destiny of being an abscondee who will be pursued for life is to surrender." n10 On 
11th July, he described them as "street rats" who should be "avoided at all costs." n11
14. I note that China has a history of kidnapping individuals abroad and forcibly returning them to China - for 
example, see the recent case of 80-year-old historian and activist Lhamjab Borjigin, arrested at his home in 
Mongolia and forcibly returned to China in May 2023. n12 Sky Net, the CCP's campaign to return 'fugitives' from 
overseas, has been expanded since 2022. n13 The transnational tactics and language now being used in relation 
to Hong Kong must be seen against this backdrop.
15. However, the Hong Kong authorities are not only targeting Hong Kongers or 'dissidents' within diaspora 
communities (to use the term in the title of this session). The transnational harassment net is now being cast ever-
wider by the Hong Kong authorities and their agents. They are now targeting those who stand up to the Hong Kong 
authorities, regardless of whether they have ever stepped foot in Hong Kong and regardless of their nationality. 
Transnational targeting of those supporting Jimmy Lai is indicative of new concerning trends which I draw to this 
Committee's attention.
16. As this Committee heard from his son, Sebastien, earlier this year, Jimmy Lai is the oldest and highest profile 
political prisoner in Hong Kong. Since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Mr Lai has been a 
leading figure in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. He is a well-known and high-profile advocate for 
democracy and peaceful assembly, and he has been an outspoken critic of human rights violations by the 
government and authorities of the People's Republic of China. His response to the horrors of Tiananmen Square 
was to found Apple Daily, one of Hong Kong's most popular newspapers and the largest independent Chinese 
language media outlet in the region until its forced closure in June 2021.
17. Due to his work, Mr Lai has been subjected to a barrage of criminal prosecutions, and faces life in prison. He is 
a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned for his peaceful campaigning activities, his writing, and his journalism, as well 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Caoilfhionn Gallagher, Internat....
as on trumped charges based on an alleged breach of a lease. He has served four sentences already; is still 
serving a fifth; and now awaits trial for sedition and offences under the NSL, on charges which arise out of his 
journalism and pro-democracy campaigning. This hearing is timely, as Mr Lai turns 76 this week, on Friday, and his 
NSL trial is due to start in a little over a week, on Monday 18th December 2023. It is clear that the authorities wish 
to see him die behind bars, and wish to use him as an example to send a chilling message to any others who would 
dare to stand up to oppression in Hong Kong.
18. Jimmy Lai's son, Sebastien, who is leading the international #FreeJimmyLai campaign, lives in Taiwan and 
regularly travels across the world to raise awareness of his father's plight and seek to secure his release. He is a 
son campaigning to see his father again. For that, the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have criticised and 
threatened him, using formal statements accusing him of criminal activity; subjected him to hateful attacks in State 
media; and have even interrupted him when he addressed the Human Rights Council in Geneva in June 2023, 
along with a member of our international legal team, Tatyana Eatwell. n14 China's conduct in Geneva shows they 
will stop at nothing to silence criticism. They will even interrupt a son speaking out for his father. A lawyer speaking 
out for her client. NGOs speaking out about the erosion of democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law in 
Hong Kong. This is a bully State, using every tool in its armoury to silence, to intimidate and to threaten.
19. These are not isolated incidents. My colleagues and I, as members of the international legal team for Jimmy Lai 
and Sebastien Lai, have been subjected to a range of actions. None of us are Hong Kongers. None of us are 
'dissidents.' Rather, we are international lawyers acting for our clients and seeking to hold China and Hong Kong to 
account for flagrant violations of Jimmy Lai's fundamental rights protected by international law. What we are 
experiencing does not come anywhere close to the most extreme examples you have heard about today, but it 
nevertheless raises very serious concerns.
20. Some of the transnational tactics used against us include:
(i) Attacks in Chinese affiliated State media since March 2022, particularly targeted at me, as lead counsel of the 
international legal team for Jimmy Lai and Sebastien Lai. This has included multiple articles in Wen Wei Po, for 
example, suggesting that my colleagues and I are "guilty" of committing national security offences, sedition and 
espionage by leading the international legal team in the case; describing me as having "strong anti-China 
sentiment" and having "slandered China" by raising human rights concerns in relation to the Beijing Olympics on my 
twitter account n15; criticising me for "blackening Hong Kong's National Security Law" by expressing concerns 
about it in an online meeting on press freedom at which I spoke at alongside Nobel Peace Laureate Maria Ressa of 
the Philippines (and another client of mine); and criticising my connections to other human rights groups, 
particularly Reporters Without Borders ("RSF") and IBAHRI.
Many of the articles in State affiliated media suggest that Jimmy Lai is guilty of offences for the very act of 
instructing international lawyers. They carry quotes from high-ranking politicians claiming that the international legal 
team are, by filing appeals and making submissions to the UN Human Rights Council Special Procedures for Mr 
Lai, acting illegally and committing serious crimes. n16 By way of example, an article published in Wen Wei Po on 
16th March 2023 included accusations that the international legal team for Jimmy Lai was "colluding with foreign 
forces" - an offence under the National Security Law. We are described as "disgusting," "anti-China foreign forces" 
committing criminal offences to "smear" the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities, and that - by being lawyers acting 
for our client - we and our client are somehow, together, "forces disrupting Hong Kong [which] are determined to 
intervene in Hong Kong affairs forcibly and undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong." By speaking to the United 
Nations or Parliamentarians, it is alleged that that the legal team, "seeks foreign forces to interfere in Hong Kong 
affairs, which must violate Hong Kong's national security law." Editorials call for ever heavier penalties for our client, 
and for our crimes to be investigated and for us to be arrested or extradited to face justice.
(ii) Reprisals from the HKSAR government, through formal public statements. These State media attacks are 
combined with formal sabre-rattling statements from the Hong Kong authorities, accusing us of committing criminal 
offences. Our crime? Being lawyers. Doing our jobs. Such a statement was released in March 2023, for example, 
following Jennifer Robinson and my addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, accusing the legal team 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing "Transnational Repression: Authoritarians Targeting Disssenters 
Abroad." Testimony by Caoilfhionn Gallagher, Internat....
of committing criminal offences for engaging with the UN on behalf of our clients, "abusing" UN processes, and 
"scandalising" the National Security Law and the Hong Kong courts. That same statement also criticised Sebastien 
Lai and claimed he was committing criminal offences by speaking out and calling for his father's release. n17
(iii) These formal actions by State actors are combined with an extensive and prolonged campaign of hacking 
attempts cyber-harassment, which has been distressing and frightening. This has included repeated hacking 
attempts on personal and professional accounts, and multiple death, rape and dismemberment threats to me, and 
threats to my family members, all of which are being dealt with by the authorities. We also regularly receive false 
notifications of inbound WhatsApp calls, purporting to come from individuals when they are alone with female 
members of the legal team, which has been particularly frightening and intimidating. The timing and content of 
these attacks are plainly designed to be attritional and stop me doing my job as Jimmy Lai's lawyer: the attacks 
come thick and fast on key days for the case. It also includes spying attempts, including requests from bogus 
journalists, bogus lawyers or bogus Parliamentary aides and staffers seeking information about the case, our client 
and our approach. Of most concern to me are tactics which I would describe as 'privilege phishing,' seeking to 
obtain legally privileged, sensitive information about clients or other targets of the authorities and thus put them at 
risk. I regularly receive emails impersonating professionals - including emails impersonating a Senate staffer, and 
partners in US law firms - requesting sensitive information; and emails purporting to be sent by me are sent to my 
clients and others. For example, when the NGO Safeguard Defenders published their recent report on illegal 
Chinese police stations abroad, they received an email purportedly from me offering them my services pro bono, 
starting an email chain which then led to requests for sensitive source information. Impersonation of a lawyer is a 
criminal offence in multiple countries worldwide for good reason. These are deeply concerning tactics which could 
risk the physical safety, liberty or even the lives of individuals who are fooled by it.
(iv) Intimidatory physical surveillance within and near the UN building in Geneva: throughout this year, I and 
colleagues on the international legal team have been placed under surveillance, followed and photographed whilst 
meeting with OHCHR staff and State Missions on Mr Lai's case. I understand that one of these incidents - which 
took place within the UN building itself - was investigated and was confirmed to be State activity.
21. These actions are clearly designed to send a message: we should not act for Jimmy Lai, and we should not 
raise concerns about China and Hong Kong's human rights records with the United Nations, other international 
organisations or States. If they go to these lengths and devote such resources to secondary targeting of lawyers 
like me, it gives an indication of the scale on which they are operating. I have acted in the most sensitive of cases 
for two decades, and the tactics which I see in Jimmy Lai's case are on a different scale and of a different severity 
to anything I have seen before.
22. I am grateful to the UN Secretary-General for drawing attention to these actions in his Report on Cooperation 
with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of rights, 21st August 2023. It states that 
multiple UN actors have raised concerns about reprisals by China against those cooperating with the UK and fear 
thereof, n18 many of whom are necessarily anonymous. Our case is the only non-anonymised example. n19 
Alarmingly, China has refused to confirm to the UN Human Rights Committee in its fourth periodic review of 
HKSAR, or to the UN Special Procedures, that engagement with the UN would not constitute an offence under the 
National Security law, stating to the Human Rights Committee that it would "depend on the particulars of the case 
and on the activities of the body in question." n20
23. The campaign by China/ Hong Kong to silence dissent and critical voices, and to shutdown scrutiny of the 
international scrutiny of their actions, is comprehensive and it is sophisticated. The actions listed above are 
designed to intimidate and silence individuals who are simply calling upon the authorities to comply with their 
international obligations, and, in the case of Hong Kong, its own domestic law that purports to guarantee rights and 
freedoms to person in Hong Kong. It is clear that China and Hong Kong's weaponisation of the law - its 'lawfare' - 
extends not only to those within its own borders, such as Jimmy Lai; and those who it erroneously describes as 
"self-exiled", such as the individuals with the bounties; but to anyone, anywhere in the world, who dares question 
their narrative.

CONCLUSION
24. These examples of Iran and China/ Hong Kong make clear the new nature of the threats we face across the 
globe. These are not distant issues. Nor are they diaspora only issues, or dissident issues. They impact upon us all.
25. One often thinks of transnational repression as being targeted at members of a diaspora, victims of human 
rights violations or members of civil society activists whose work or campaigning exposes grave human rights 
violations or other abuses committed by a State. The targeting of my colleagues and I, as the legal representatives 
of Jimmy Lai and Sebastien Lai, is illustrative of the extent to which China attempts to shut down any and all 
scrutiny of its conduct and compliance with its international obligations, including those who engage with the UN 
Human Rights Council, of which China is a member n21 and as a member, purports to uphold the principles and 
purposes of the UN and the promotion and protection of human rights. It is an outrage that China can sit on the 
Human Rights Council whilst at the same time continue to its attempts to harass and intimidate with individuals and 
entities who seek to engage with it.
26. The US Government issued a Hong Kong Business Advisory on 16th July 2021 warning US businesses of the 
emerging risks to their operations and activities in Hong Kong posed by the National Security Law. n22 The growing 
threat of transnational repression by China and the Hong Kong authorities underlines the need for urgent effective 
measures must be taken to address incidents of physical and online targeting and harassment of lawyers, members 
of civil society, human rights campaigners, and academics, who are based outside of China and Hong Kong. Such 
measures, at a national level, require a "whole government" approach to an issue that engages the interests of 
national security, foreign affairs, and business and trade, in cooperation with social media platforms and tech 
companies. Individuals and groups at risk must be warned of the sophisticated and insidious methods used to 
target perceived critics of China and Hong Kong, and associated risks. At an international level, it is only through 
the collaboration and cooperation of States, that this growing threat can be properly addressed, and individuals are 
protected.

Euro stocks up amid hope on ECB rate hikes

ELLEN O REGAN  There was a rally  across the board  of European markets yesterday, driven largely by news 
from central bankers that may indicate an end is in sight for tightening monetary policy and interest rate hikes.
 DUBLIN The Iseq All Share index rose by 0.41 per cent yesterday to 8,465.53, although still trailed slightly 
behind gains seen by some European peers.
Among the banks, AIB rose by 0.23 per cent to EUR 4.34, while Bank of Ireland fell by 1.21 per cent to EUR 8.65 
and Permanent TSB dropped by 3.15 per cent to EUR 1.69.
It was a strong day for home builder Glenveagh Properties, which gained 2.23 per cent to EUR 1.10. Rival Cairn 
Homes also rose, by 0.95 per cent to EUR 1.27. Building materials company Kingspan added 0.50 per cent, to 
close at EUR 71.70.
Food firm Kerry Group also performed well on the day, rising by 1.37 per cent to EUR 75.26. Glanbia rose by 0.64 
per cent to close at EUR 15.23.
Paddy Power parent  Flutter Entertainment rose by 1.21 per cent to EUR 146.05. Budget airline Ryanair rose by 
0.42 per cent to close at EUR 18.11.
Packaging giant Smurfit Kappa slipped 1.45 per cent to EUR 34.78, while insurance company FBD Holdings also 
fell, losing 1.78 per cent to close at EUR 11.05.
LONDON The export-heavy FTSE 100 Index fell by 0.31 per cent yesterday to close at 7,489.84, while the 
FTSE Mid-Cap 250 Index rose by 0.69 per cent to close at 18,487.53.
London s market suffered its third outage in a few months yesterday and the London Stock Exchange Group said it 
is investigating the latest one, which halted trading for about 2,000 smaller shares.
Trading for affected stocks was interrupted twice during morning trading according to the exchange s website. Both 
episodes lasted about an hour.
Euro stocks up amid hope on ECB rate hikes
 Barclays fell by 2.46 per cent after one of the British bank s largest shareholders, Qatar Holding, moved to sell 
around £510 million (EUR 595 million) of its stock.
EUROPE The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index rose by 0.38 per cent on Tuesday, while the German Dax rose 
by 0.78 per cent and the French Cac 40 gained 0.74 per cent.
Investor sentiments were boosted by indications from the European Central Bank (ECB) that it could be finished 
with hiking interest rates.
ECB executive board member Isabel Schnabel said yesterday that the consumer price data released last week 
makes another hike in borrowing costs  rather unlikely. 
German financial services company Allianz gained 1.55 per cent, while German commercial vehicle manufacturer 
Daimler Truck Holding added 3.70 per cent. Ericsson jumped 6.08 per cent after AT&T chose the Swedish  firm 
over Finnish rival Nokia to build a telecom network, sending the latter s shares down 5.94 per cent to near the 
bottom of the Stoxx 600.
 NEW YORK Trading was down across New York s three main indices yesterday, although softening 
economic data heightened expectations among traders that the US central bank may end its interest rate 
hiking cycle.
Figures on the US labour market showed that job openings dropped in October to the lowest level since early 2021, 
indicating that the labour market was easing as higher interest rates cool demand in the economy.
Among individual stocks, Take-Two Interactive Software fell after a trailer of the latest instalment of its best-selling 
Grand Theft Auto video game franchise was released. With the title planned for 2025, analysts were disappointed 
by the lack of an exact release date.    Additional reporting from Reuters and Bloomberg

ONLINE travel agent On The Beach is to pursue Ryanair for more refunds after its High Court victory over flights 
cancelled during the pandemic.
It wants more cash to be returned by the budget airline after refunding travellers whose flights were either cancelled 
or who chose a refund when their flight was changed during Covid.
The High Court last month ordered Ryanair to pay out more than £2m to package holiday companies.
Ryanair at the time said that the companies still had to prove they had refunded customers before receiving 
payment from airlines.
On The Beach said: "This common-sense outcome should not have taken a protracted and expensive legal process 
to resolve." It said it was still pursuing Ryanair for further refunds.
It is thought the amount is at a similar level to the £2m Ryanair has been told to pay by the High Court.
Meanwhile, On The Beach revenue for the year to the end of September rose 19pc, while tourist passenger 
numbers between May and October were up 13pc on the same period last year.

The largest European low-cost airline, Ryanair, announced today that from April it will establish direct flights from 
Sarajevo to Gothenburg, London, Brussels, Memmingen and Milan.
The Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nermin Niki?, said that he hopes that the number 
of the initial five destinations will be expanded so that as many tourists as possible come to our country and that our 
citizens have a connection with as many destinations as possible in the world.
- I am sure that it is much easier for the management of the Ryanair company to enter into such a project when they 
see that the institutions of the state stand behind it. We in the FBiH Government will monitor and support such 
projects, and on Thursday at the Government session we will make a decision on the payment of grant funds to 
airports in the FBiH area - added Niki?.

Antifraud authorities in the United Kingdom on Wednesday arrested Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, the director of a 
company that allegedly sold airplane parts with forged safety documents, Bloomberg News reported.
The Serious Fraud Office raided Zamora’s home on the outskirts of London as part of its investigation alongside the 
country’s Civil Aviation Authority. The suspect’s company, AOG Technics, is alleged to have sold parts with false 
certificates to repair jet engines on civilian aircraft throughout the world.
The scandal has raised questions about whether procedures to ensure the authenticity of airplane parts throughout 
the supply chain are adequate. Several airlines have grounded planes to inspect and replace parts with suspect 
documents.
The suspicions center on the best-selling CFM56 jet engine that were fitted on A320 planes made by Airbus 
(OTCPK:EADSY) (OTCPK:EADSF) and 737s made by Boeing (NYSE:BA).

Dec 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, the major news in the airline domain was the inking of Alaska Air Group's ALK[1] deal to buy 
Hawaiian Airlines for $18 per share in cash. The price represents a massive 270% premium to the closing price of 
Hawaiian Holdings HA[2] - Hawaiian Airlines' parent company - on Dec 1 (the last trading day before the deal was 
announced). The transaction is valued at $1.9 billion. This includes $900 million of Hawaiian Airlines' debt. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was also in the news, courtesy of its impressive traffic numbers for November, driven 
by upbeat air travel demand. The antitrust trial, which was debating on JetBlue Airways' JBLU[4] planned 
acquisition of Spirit Airlines SAVE[5], has ended. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Alaska Air's deal to buy 
HA is expected to be accretive to ALK's earnings within two years post-closure, with at least $235 million of 
expected run-rate synergies. In the event of the deal materializing, Alaska Air's fleet will expand to 365 narrow and 
wide-body planes. The transaction has gained approval from the boards of both companies. However, the 
materialization of the buyout is dependent on required regulatory approvals, Hawaiian Holdings shareholders' 
approval (expected to be sought in the first quarter of 2024) and other customary closing conditions. After all these 
steps, the deal is expected to close in 12-18 months. Even after the deal closure, both companies will maintain their 
respective brands[7]. 
In another development, it was announced that ALK will exit the S&P 500 index on Dec 18, 2023. The airline will 
move down to the S&P SmallCap 600. 
2. The number of passengers ferried on Ryanair flights in November was 11.7 million, marking a 4% year-over-year 
rise in passengers. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. 
The reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. 
However, more than 960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. 
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[8]. 
3. The trial in which the U.S. Department of Justice urged a federal judge to block JetBlue's intended $3.8-billion 
acquisition of Spirit Airlines in an effort to preserve competition among the lowest-cost carriers has been wrapped 
up. The federal judge may allow the merger to proceed if JetBlue divests more assets. Per a Reuters report,[9] U.S. 
District Judge William Young told a JetBlue lawyer that he expected airline fares to rise if no-frills, ultra-low-cost 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY 's Traffic Impresses
Spirit no longer was around to "undercut everyone else" and drive down prices. The judge, who will decide the case 
in the non-jury trial in Boston, told both parties that he was having "trouble" with the Justice Department's request 
for a permanent injunction blocking a deal in a "dynamic industry facing unique opportunities and challenges in the 
post-COVID environment." Price Performance The following table shows the price movements of the major airline 
players over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that almost all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. Consequently, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index improved 12.2% to $62.3 over the past week. Over the course of six months, the sector 
tracker has decreased 6.1%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

Explainer: Is there a new fee for Ryanair customers? What we know about boarding pass confusion
Explainer: Is there a new fee for Ryanair customers? What we know about 
boarding pass confusion

Confusion reigns about a possible change of practice by Europe’s biggest budget airline, Ryanair, requiring some 
passengers either to queue for a paper boarding pass at the airport or pay for seat selection. Travellers have 
accused the carrier of imposing a money-making policy ahead of the Christmas rush.
An airline spokesperson said: “There is no new procedure in force.”
But some travellers have said that they were informed the standard option to show a mobile boarding pass on their 
smart phone was not open to them.
The issue is still far from clear. But these are the key questions and answers about Ryanair check-in and boarding 
policies as we understand them so far.
                     What’s the background to Ryanair’s check-in requirements?                   
In 2008, Ryanair became the first airline anywhere in the world to ask passengers to check in online before 
reaching the airport. The aim was to cut costs: drastically reducing the number of travellers who had to see a check-
in agent at a desk, and commensurately allowing Ryanair to pay less for space at the departure airport.
The option of checking in at the airport has remained available – but at a high cost. The fee started at £10, but 
within a year increased to £40. It is now £55 for each passenger on a booking.
Initially the boarding pass had to be printed out to avoid the charge. This was annoying and difficult for people on 
holiday abroad.
Soon, though, Ryanair aligned with other airlines that allow boarding passes to be carried on mobile phones and 
shown while going through the airport and at the departure gate.
Explainer: Is there a new fee for Ryanair customers? What we know about boarding pass confusion
                     Can I use mobile boarding passes everywhere?                   
No. Ryanair says: “We accept mobile boarding passes on flights from the majority of airports on our network. 
However unfortunately some airports cannot accept mobile boarding passes yet.”
These airports including Kefalonia in Greece, the Albanian capital, Tirana, and all airports in Morocco, Turkey, 
Israel and Lebanon.
Ryanair says: “Customers travelling from these airports must check in online and print out a paper boarding pass 
for their flight.”
                     Wasn’t there a controversy about airport check-in earlier this year?                   
Yes. In August, Ryanair was heavily criticised after charging two elderly passengers £110 at London Stansted 
airport, after the couple inadvertently checked in for their inbound rather than outbound flight to France.
At the time, a spokesperson for the airline said: “In accordance with Ryanair’s T&Cs, which these passengers 
agreed to at the time of booking, they failed to check-in online before arriving at Stansted airport (11 Aug) despite 
receiving an email reminder (10 Aug) to check in online. These passengers were correctly charged the airport 
check-in fee.”
                     How do travellers avoid charges for extras on Ryanair?                   
Simply by declining all invitations to pay for extra services, and complying with the rules on cabin baggage (carrying 
no more than one small item measuring no more than 40 x 20 x 25cm).
Consider the £15 one-way journey (correct at time of research) from Edinburgh to Shannon on 11 December. 
Options offered include:
                                            a 10kg checked bag for an extra £18                       priority boarding and an additional, 
larger piece of hand luggage for an extra £22                       fast-track security for £7                       selecting a seat 
in advance, a minimum of £8                                        
If all these extras were chosen, the fare would increase by £55 – to nearly five times the original price. Passengers, 
though, are able to opt out of all the extras.
                     What has happened now?                   
Some passengers who decline the option to book a specific seat in advance, and instead accept random seat 
allocation, say they have been told they cannot use an online boarding pass.
They say they were invited to choose between paying for a specific seat, at which point they could use their smart 
phone, or queue up for a paper boarding pass at a Ryanair desk.
One passenger, Andrew Brown, told The Independent: “Ryanair says that you can check in but if you want to avoid 
queuing for a free-of-charge printed boarding card at check in you should pay for a dedicated seat. Then you can 
have your boarding card on your phone as before.”
He speculated: “They’re trying to discourage people from selecting a free random seat. It was brought in without 
notice and there’s nothing on their website about the policy change.
“It puts an end to my practice of taking just hand baggage with no allocated seat and no extras, so just the fare.”
Another passenger, Neil Gregory, told the BBC : “The app said if I opted for a free random seat I’d have to go to 
check-in to get a paper boarding pass, which I’ve never seen before. If you wanted a digital boarding pass, it said 
you had to pay for a reserved seat.”
Explainer: Is there a new fee for Ryanair customers? What we know about boarding pass confusion
The BBC said a traveller was told by staff at the airport check-in desk that the new policy was only for the last 20 
passengers checking in for each flight.
On a “random seat assignment” booking for a flight from London Stansted to Italy for 5 December, The Independent 
experienced no difficulty checking in online as normal and getting a digital boarding pass on a smart phone.
                     What does Ryanair say?                   
The Belfast Telegraph has been trying to establish exactly what the airline’s policy is.
A spokesperson for the airline said: “There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass – ever. All Ryanair 
passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select 
a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge.”
The Belfast Telegraph then asked specifically, can passengers who don't choose a seat – and who therefore avoid 
the seat fee - also get their digital boarding pass for free on their phone?
So far there has been no response to this question.
                     What could be going on?                   
Some background: Ryanair has been conducting a campaign to try to persuade passengers not to buy tickets for its 
flights through online travel agents (OTAs). One aspect of this involves requiring some passengers who do book 
through an OTA to go through a series of verification checks before being allowed to check in.
Travellers are told: “Your booking is blocked because it looks like it was booked through an online travel agent who 
has no commercial relationship with us to sell our flights.
“Online travel agents often do not provide us with your correct email address and payment details, so we need to 
verify your identity. We also need to carry out this process in order to ensure we can comply with safety and 
security requirements.”
This very process comes at a cost to Ryanair – as would requiring some passengers to go to a desk at the airport
One theory is that the airline has a new policy of asking some passengers who opt not to select a seat to queue up 
for a paper boarding pass, in a bid to increase the proportion choosing and paying for a specific seat.
Passenger Andrew Brown said: “I’m a regular and think Ryanair is great. But this is a stealth charge.”
The Independent has seen nothing to substantiate the assertions.
The airline spokesperson said: “There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass – ever.”

RYANAIR has denied claims it is charging a new fee for e-boarding passes.
The BBC said some people on social media claimed they'd been charged up to £21 - or alternatively had to queue 
for a paper pass at the airport.
Ryanair said: "There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass - ever.
"All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish, or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, 
they can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge."
One passenger contacted the airline on X, saying: "When and why did you start this carry on? I now have to 
QUEUE to collect my boarding pass at the airport?"
Another said: "So what's this forcing people to buy seats after purchasing a flight or queue for a boarding pass all 
about? I thought the option to take a random seat was to avoid extra queues? Another cash gathering exercise?"
The claims suggest Ryanair is asking some passengers to book a seat for between £7 and £21 before they can 
download their boarding pass.
If they do not book a seat, they have to queue for a pass at the airport.
Over the years budget airlines have introduced charges for addons such as putting luggage in the hold, booking 
seats or choosing a seat with extra legroom.

Highlight: On The Beach was awarded £2 million in October after it said it had to refund customers’ flights as 
Ryanair did not do so
Body
Online travel agent On The Beach says it will continue to “pursue Ryanair  for further sums”, after winning a £2 
million court case over refunds  for flights  cancelled by the low-cost airline.
On The Beach was awarded £2 million in October after it said it had to refund customers ’ flights as Ryanair did not 
do so.
“This common-sense outcome should not have taken a protracted and expensive legal process to resolve,” it said.
The travel agent said it had been forced to pay more refunds since the case began, and it was now trying to chase 
claims for these.
Ryanair itself took legal action against On The Beach in 2010 over an intellectual property dispute, but the case has 
still not progressed to court. On the Beach says “final resolution of the dispute might take some time”.
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.
The travel agent also revealed its profits increased sixfold to £12.9 million in the year to 30 September. The shares 
gained 17.6p, or 15%, to 135p.
CEO Shaun Morton said: “"I am pleased with the Group's incredibly strong performance this year.

Ryanair has been accused of making a "scandalous" change to its check-in policy in a move that will affect millions 
of passengers.
Only passengers who pay for a reserved seat are now allowed to download a mobile boarding pass or print one at 
home.
Those who refuse to pay for a seat - allowing it to be allocated at random - now have to queue at the airport check-
in desks to be issued with a pass. Charges for a reserved seat range from £4.50-£15.50 per flight.
Passengers have complained of being made to stand in "30-metre" queues to be issued with a boarding pass 
before they can go on to clear security.
One passenger wrote on Twitter/X: "I just can't believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a 
boarding pass (mobile or printout) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to 
do so for no other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous."
Some passengers said that the new policy meant passengers now have to pay for a mobile boarding pass, 
although the airline denied this.
Ryanair said: "There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass - ever. All Ryanair passengers can pay for a 
reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated seat 
entirely free of charge."
Ministers have vowed to crack down on so-called "drip pricing", advertising one price upfront and revealing other 
charges later in the buying process.

CTK's Business News in Brief
Ryanair to fly regularly from Pardubice to Girona
-----------------------------------------------------------
Pardubice, East Bohemia - Irish carrier Ryanair will operate a regular biweekly service from Pardubice to Girona in 
Catalonia, Spain, from April 2024, the Pardubice airport has said in a press release.
"I believe that the new connection to this attractive destination will be successful from both directions and will 
increase tourism in the Pardubice Region," said Ivan Cech, head of the East Bohemian Airport company, which 
operates the Pardubice airport. Ryanair already flies from Pardubice to Alicante in Spain. This year, the line is 
estimated to carry over 22,000 passengers. In 2017-2019, Ryanair also operated a service from Pardubice to 
London, which it cancelled.
Ostrava airport to add regular flights to Malaga from spring
-----------------------------------------
Mosnov, North Moravia - The international Leos Janacek Ostrava Airport will offer a new regular service to Malaga, 
Spain, from spring, to be operated by Ryanair every Monday and Thursday, airport operator Letiste Ostrava told 
CTK in a press release today.
The airport is expecting a significant expansion of operations in 2024, said airport head Jaromir Radkovsky. In 
addition to the new service to Malaga, Ryanair will also increase the number of flights to London-Stansted from two 
per week to three per week starting from the end of March.
Panasonic starts building heat pump production facility in Plzen
----------------------------------
Plzen, West Bohemia - Japanese corporation Panasonic has started building a new, significantly larger heat pump 
production facility in Plzen at a cost of Kc7.6bn, Panasonic Heating & Ventilation Air-Conditioning Czech CEO 
Hiroshi Komatsubara said at today's launch of the construction.
CTK's Business News in Brief
Plzen will become the European headquarters for production, research and development. The new plant is due to 
open in May 2025 and will produce up to one million heat pumps a year by 2030, with the products to be exported 
to the whole of Europe, Komatsubara said. Panasonic has been operating in Plzen since 1996, when it started 
producing televisions there as the first Japanese investor in the Czech Republic. Panasonic started producing 
pumps in Plzen in 2018, but the production ran in parallel with the production of televisions. Last year, the 
production of televisions ended and now the company is focusing exclusively on heat pumps, Komatsubara said.
Kralupy refinery to have heat recovery unit worth over Kc500m
-----------------------------
Kralupy nad Vltavou, Central Bohemia - The Orlen Unipetrol group will build a heat recovery unit to recover flue gas 
heat at its production plant in Kralupy nad Vltavou at a cost exceeding Kc500m, the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl 
said in a press release today.
The unit is expected to be completed in mid-2025, according to the press release. The group expects that the unit 
will reduce the refinery's emissions by as much as 15 kilotons per year. The Orlen Unipetrol group is the largest 
refining and petrochemical company in the Czech Republic.
Ceske drahy to raise wages by 2.3 pct from January
-------------------------------
Prague - Czech national rail operator Ceske drahy has signed a collective agreement with the trade unions for next 
year, agreeing on a 2.3 percent increase in wages and the retention of existing benefits such as working hours, 
holidays and various forms of contributions, Ceske drahy said in a press release today.
Ceske drahy employees should also receive an extraordinary bonus of Kc12,000, according to the press release. In 
2022, the carrier employed 21,875 people.

Ryanair will fly three new routes out of Norwich Airport to desirable Mediterranean destinations from next spring, it 
has been revealed.
The budget airline will run flights to Malta, Alicante and Faro on Mondays and Fridays from April 1, as well as a host 
of return journeys.
Aviation analyst Sean Moulton shared the news with his 16,600 followers on X, along with detailed flight times and 
numbers.
Tickets are not yet on sale but have been loaded onto Ryanair's online system ahead of the new year, screenshots 
show, which Mr Moulton said he expects to be available for purchase "soon".
Norwich Airport currently operates flights to 18 destinations in nine countries, with connections to 150 more 
locations via Amsterdam.
Journeys to Malta and Spanish port city Alicante have been previously available with KLM and the now-defunct 
Flybe, but services were cancelled shortly before the Covid pandemic.
Portuguese destination Faro, however, is a new location for the city airport, which will be provided by a 6.40pm to 
9.40pm outbound or 3.15pm to 6.15pm inbound flight.
Norwich Airport has been contacted for comment and is understood to be close to confirming its first association 
with Ryanair, which flies regularly from Stansted.
Three new routes a boost for city airport
Vicky Samwell-Buckenham, manager at Norwich-based agency Oyster Travel, said the routes would only be good 
news for the region.
"People will be over the moon to hear they can fly to these destinations from Norwich Airport again," she said.
"Our customers always love to fly from Norwich and will be happy to continue to support the airport going forward.
She added: "It will be a happy return for those who remember being able to fly to Malta or Malaga with Flybe in the 
past."
Tui is currently Norwich Airport's biggest operator by destination with nine routes in total, but has regularly attracted 
criticism in recent years for delays and cancellations.

‘Scandalous’ Ryanair change will affect millions of passengers

Highlight: Only travellers who pay for a reserved seat can download a mobile boarding pass or print one at home, 
it is claimed
Body
Ryanair has been accused of making a “scandalous” change to its check-in policy, in a move that will affect millions 
of passengers.
The Irish airline quietly implemented the change, which only allows passengers who pay for a reserved seat to 
download a mobile boarding pass or print one at home.
Those who refuse to pay for a seat — allowing it to be allocated at random — now have to queue at the airport 
check-in desks to be issued with a pass. Charges for a reserved seat range from £4.50-£15.50 per flight. 
The move has enraged passengers who complained of being made to stand in “30-metre” queues to be issued with 
a boarding pass. Only then can they clear security.
One passenger wrote on X/Twitter: “I just can’t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a 
boarding pass (mobile or printout) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to 
do so for no other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous.”
The move makes it even harder to board a flight having only paid the headline fare. Previously passengers willing to 
travel with only a small under-seat cabin bag and be randomly allocated a seat at check-in could fly for the 
advertised fare.
Anyone wanting to carry a bigger bag on board, book a seat or check-in luggage would have to pay extra.
Passengers who have been issued a boarding pass but lost it, or do not have a phone, are already charged £20 by 
Ryanair
 to have it printed at the airport. If a passenger fails to check-in at home, they must pay £55 at the airport.
‘Scandalous’ Ryanair change will affect millions of passengers
‘BA charged us an extra £158 to sit together in business class’
Some passengers said that the new policy meant passengers now have to pay for a mobile boarding pass, 
although the airline strongly denied this.
However, a spokeswoman stopped replying to The Times when asked about the policy of not issuing mobile passes 
to passengers without a reserved seat.
The statement said: “There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass — ever. All Ryanair passengers can 
pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly 
allocated seat entirely free of charge.”
Ministers have vowed to crack down on so-called “drip pricing”. It announced a new consumers’ bill at the King’s 
Speech, granting “new powers to enable growing consumer harms to be tackled”.
Drip pricing is the practice whereby businesses only advertise part of a product’s price upfront and reveal other 
charges later in the buying process.
It would ban airlines from charging extra for luggage, seat selection, travel insurance or food and drink vouchers at 
the point of purchase. The practice is most common in the aviation, retail, entertainment and communication 
sectors.
It has become particularly prevalent in the airline industry. The government’s impact assessment of the practice 
found that the median charge for luggage, the most regularly selected product, is £65 — a 54 per cent increase on 
the headline ticket price.

LOW-COST airline Ryanair has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel 
and Hamas.
It comes after the Irish carrier cancelled over 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in Gaza.
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7 and due to the subsequent escalation of the war.
Rival EASYJET said last week that conflict and the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected 
demand for flights in destiminority nations such as Egypt, while it saw bookings impacted across the board in 
October and November due to the war.
EasyJet warned that it does not expect to narrow losses in the first quarter of its new financial year as flights and 
wider demand are affected, but it said booking appetite had started to recover in recent weeks.
Ryanair's latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4% increase in 
people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said yesterday that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until 
early next month.
The budget airline said it "continues to monitor the situation on the ground closely, and stands ready to redeploy 
capacity should conditions stabilise".
It carried 29.3% more passengers in November, at 4.8 million.
Wizz Air said it had also restarted inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova, in Eastern Europe having suspended flights 
to the country in March due to tensions linked to Russia's war with Ukraine.

Pilot told passengers before landing he wasn't feeling well, according to a report
A Ryanair plane had to make an emergency landing in Portugal after the pilot fell ill.
The aircraft was heading from the UK to Morocco but ended up landing at Faro Airport on the Portuguese Algarve 
this morning, according to local reports.
The pilot had told passengers before landing that he wasn't feeling well and the diversion triggered a 'red alert' at 
the airport, according to Portuguese daily Correio da Manha.
A spokesperson from Ryanair said: 'There was no "emergency landing".
'This flight from Stansted to Morocco (5 Dec) diverted to Faro when one of the pilots became ill. 
'The aircraft landed normally, and passengers were transferred to an alternative aircraft operated by another crew 
before continuing to Morocco.'
In April a packed easyJet plane heading to Agadir in Morocco from London Gatwick had to divert to Faro.
Local reports at the time said the flight diversion was the result of the pilot suffering an 'indisposition', and led to an 
identical red alert being activated before the Airbus A320 was landed safely.
EasyJet said in a comment at the time: 'easyJet can confirm that flight EZY6469 from London Gatwick to Agadir on 
21 April diverted to Faro due to the First Officer requiring medical assistance.
'The Captain performed a routine landing in accordance with standard operating procedures and the aircraft was 
met by medical services on arrival in Faro.

'A replacement crew was arranged and passengers have since continued their journey to Agadir. We apologise for 
any inconvenience experienced due to the diversion and resulting delay.
'The safety and well-being of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority.'

Low-cost airline Ryanair has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel 
and Hamas.
It comes after the Irish carrier cancelled over 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in Gaza.
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7 and due to the subsequent escalation of the war.
Rival easyJet said last week that conflict and the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected demand 
for flights in destinations such as Egypt, while it saw bookings impacted across the board in October and November 
due to the war.
EasyJet warned it does not expect to narrow losses in the first quarter of its new financial year as flights and wider 
demand are affected, but it said booking appetite had started to recover in recent weeks.
Ryanair's latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4% increase in 
people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said yesterday it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until early 
January next year.
The budget airline said it "continues to monitor the situation closely, and stands ready to redeploy capacity should 
conditions stabilise".
Wizz Air said it had also restarted inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova, in Eastern

It said the move follows a "comprehensive evaluation of safety factors", adding that the group "intends to gradually

Ryanair has revealed the discovery and replacement of unauthorized engine parts in two of its aircraft during 
routine inspections. The parts, suspected to be supplied by UK-based AOG Technics, were identified several 
months ago during checks in Brazil and the United States. Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, stated that the issue 
involved certain CFM56 engines manufactured by CFM International, impacting several Boeing B737NG and Airbus 
A320ceo family aircraft.
AOG Technics has faced scrutiny for selling parts with falsified Authorized Release Certificates (ARCs), as revealed 
by the European Aviation Safety Agency in August. While the problem has affected multiple airlines globally, 
O'Leary emphasized that Ryanair had been "largely unaffected" by the issue, having never engaged with AOG 
Technics.
The two affected engines are currently in workshops, with the relevant parts forwarded to investigators examining 
AOG Technics. O'Leary called for stricter controls over third-party suppliers in light of this incident. Other airlines, 
including Southwest Airlines, TUI Airways, TAP Portugal, and Virgin Australia, have also temporarily grounded 
aircraft to address the problem. Ryanair operates over 500 Boeing B737NG aircraft.

Ryanair has revealed the discovery and replacement of unauthorized engine parts in two of its aircraft during 
routine inspections. The parts, suspected to be supplied by UK-based AOG Technics, were identified several 
months ago during checks in Brazil and the United States. Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, stated that the issue 
involved certain CFM56 engines manufactured by CFM International, impacting several Boeing B737NG and Airbus 
A320ceo family aircraft.
AOG Technics has faced scrutiny for selling parts with falsified Authorized Release Certificates (ARCs), as revealed 
by the European Aviation Safety Agency in August. While the problem has affected multiple airlines globally, 
O'Leary emphasized that Ryanair had been "largely unaffected" by the issue, having never engaged with AOG 
Technics.
The two affected engines are currently in workshops, with the relevant parts forwarded to investigators examining 
AOG Technics. O'Leary called for stricter controls over third-party suppliers in light of this incident. Other airlines, 
including Southwest Airlines, TUI Airways, TAP Portugal, and Virgin Australia, have also temporarily grounded 
aircraft to address the problem. Ryanair operates over 500 Boeing B737NG aircraft.

Ryanair says it cancelled 960 flights in November due to Gaza conflict
Ryanair says it cancelled 960 flights in November due to Gaza conflict

Ryanair has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel and Hamas. 
It comes after the carrier cancelled more than 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in Gaza.
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7th and due to the subsequent escalation of the war.
Rival EasyJet said last week that conflict and the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected 
demand for flights in destinations such as Egypt, while it saw bookings impacted across the board in October and 
November due to the war.
 EasyJet warned that it does not expect to narrow losses in the first quarter of its new financial year as flights and 
wider demand are affected, but it said booking appetite had started to recover in recent weeks.
Ryanair s latest passenger statistics showed it operated more than  66,400 flights in November, with a 4 per cent 
increase in people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said yesterday that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until 
early January next year. 
The budget airline said it  continues to monitor the situation on the ground closely, and stands ready to redeploy 
capacity should conditions stabilise .
It carried 29.3 per cent more passengers in November, at 4.8 million.
Wizz Air said it had also restarted inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova, in eastern Europe having suspended flights 
to the country in March due to tensions linked to Russia s war with Ukraine. 
It said the move follows a  comprehensive evaluation of safety factors , adding that the group  intends to gradually 
reintroduce operations, including reopening its base in Chisinau, while ensuring safe and secure operations for its 
crew and passengers .   PA

Stock Spotlight: easyJet soars to profitability as dividend return opens stock to income seekers

Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said easyJet had "finally put the ravages wrought by the 
pandemic to bed", thanks to a combination of "aggressive measures" by the group and the tailwind of people 
returning to travel.
Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, said the stock had "shone" following its swing back into 
profitability for the year, which it revealed in its full-year results last week (28 November).
Stock Spotlight: Starbucks brews success in Q4 despite union discord
The company reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of £455m, compared to an expected £441.6m, well ahead of the 
previous year's loss of £178m.
A large amount of the growth has come from the sales of its package holidays, which are expected to expand by 
over 35% next year.
"The group has seen a true profitable benefit from ancillary revenues, which continue to boost revenues, and which 
include the likes of customer payments for personally allocated seats, baggage and food," added Hunter.
Revenues increased by 42% to £8.2bn during the period, which Hunter attributed to the company's pricing strength, 
an increase in capacity and load factors, and further strong growth in the easyJet holidays arm.
"At the same time, the group continues to target more profitable primary airports, as opposed to some of its 
competitors who choose to fly to cheaper, but less convenient, destinations," he noted.

Stock Spotlight: easyJet soars to profitability as dividend return opens stock to income seekers
The airline's load factor - the metric used in the airline industry which measures the percentage of available seating 
capacity that has been filled with passengers - rose to 89% in 2023, up from 86% in 2022. The number of 
passengers also increased, jumping 19% to 82.8 million.
However, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, noted this was "well below the levels Ryanair 
has been able to achieve, where load factors are at 93%".
He added that despite the strong performance of the firm, easyJet had struggled to bring its stock price back to 
levels it was trading at earlier this year.
easyJet's stock price is up 40.7% year-to-date but still sits 12% below the 2023 peak set in May, according to data 
from Morningstar Direct.
The share price is still down 63.4% from its pre-Covid February 2020 levels and Hewson said it had failed to keep 
up with competitor Ryanair's stock, which was up 63% year-to-date and has now surpassed its pre-pandemic 
levels.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the return of the firm's dividend represented a "tick in the box for its 
long-awaited recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic".
He noted that while the travel sector has seen strong demand in the past few years, intense cost pressures have 
been problematic for operators.
"Many airlines got heavily into debt during the pandemic, and they have had to prioritise paying down borrowings 
before dishing out dividends to shareholders," he explained.
Stock Spotlight: Toyota EV pivot may not be enough to catch Tesla
The net cash position of the firm has now pushed it to feel comfortable restarting dividends for the first time since 
2020, he added.
Hunter agreed: "The very fact that easyJet is in a position to make this move is a far cry from the recent past and 
shows confidence in prospects, which have taken some time to recover."
He added that while a projected yield of 1.1% was "for the moment little more than a gesture", the group plans to 
grow the dividend significantly over the next few years.
Beauchamp added that the reappearance of a dividend would also allow income investors to return to the stock, 
"providing hope of more inflows to boost the share price".
However, Mould warned the key challenge for the firm was to "sustain this positive momentum", which may prove 
difficult in the face of high interest rates and an ongoing cost-of-living crisis.

Park and ride trial to be extended following bumper weekend
Park and ride trial to be extended following bumper weekend

A city park and ride site that was given a second chance following a three-year closure has had its trial extended by 
more than three months.
The news comes after the Postwick Park and Ride reopened in September after being used as a Covid testing 
centre, but it was only planned to be open for four months.
But council bosses have confirmed the trial period will now be extended until April following an uptick in use and to 
allow more communities to take advantage of the service.
Councillor Graham Plant, cabinet member for highways, infrastructure and transport, said: "The Postwick Park and 
Ride has been open for more than three months now and figures are going in the right direction.
"Last Saturday saw the most passengers in one day since its reopening.
READ MORE: Ryanair will fly to THREE new Mediterranean destinations from Norwich Airport
"However, numbers are still low at around 37pc of pre-pandemic levels so we still need many more people using 
this service regularly to make it viable for the future."
The site was initially closed to become a Covid testing centre but was reopened as a trial ahead of last Christmas, 
with councillors subsequently emphasising the importance of keeping the site open.
The council warned the public to "use it or lose it" when talking about the 552-car-capacity site which the county 
council say costs 250,000 a year to run.

Mr Plant added: "We know how important this service is - particularly to those living in villages to the east - so we 
have decided to extend the trial until Easter next year to give it the best chance of getting passenger numbers back 
up."
The council also hopes to drive up numbers with quality-of-life changes to its "Travel Norfolk Journey Planner".
This includes showing the number of spaces available at all park and ride sites and a new function that is going live 
at the end of this week for park and ride journeys to appear as individual options when searched through the 
system.

Tirana is one of Europe's most affordable city breaks 
 This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it. Learn more
Planning a city break? With prices soaring around the globe, it’s becoming more challenging to find an affordable 
mini-break.
However, there are still a few destinations where it’s possible to travel without breaking the bank.
Tirana, the capital of beautiful Albania, is one of the most affordable options for a city break and a fantastic choice 
for Britons looking to explore on a budget.
Albania is fast becoming a popular tourist destination but Brits that head there soon will find the country is still 
something of a hidden gem.
So what is there to do in Tirana?
Tirana is an affordable choice for Brits looking for a city break 
Surrounded by mountains, one of the best ways to admire Tirana is from the top of Dajti mountain, easily reached 
on the city’s cable car. At the top, tourists will find fantastic views of the city and a range of family-friendly activities.
A tourist wrote on Tripadvisor: “We were very lucky that the day we chose to go to the Dajti Mountain by the 
Ekspres Cable Car, it was wall to wall sunshine and the panoramic views were spectacular.”
In the city, tourists can visit one of Tirana’s museums, with Bunk’Art 1 and 2 top of most travellers’ lists.
Aubergine is a central ingredient of Albanian cuisine 
‘Spectacular’ destination is one of the cheapest city breaks in Europe
Housed in the city’s former bunkers, each museum delves into aspects of Albanian life under Enver Hoxha’s 
dictatorship. To find out more about the fearsome techniques the dictator’s secret service used to track citizens, 
head to the House of Leaves museum in the centre of the city.
Tirana also has a thriving nightlife scene and tourists will find fantastic cocktail bars in the Blokku district. Expect to 
pay no more than £6 or £7 for a cocktail.
When it comes to restaurants, the city has tons of options. Look out for lamb or aubergine dishes or pick up a 
famous burek pastry from a local bakery.
Brits visiting during spring or summer could also take a day trip to Durres, a nearby beach resort or head north to 
explore the countryside.
It takes just over three hours to reach Tirana from London with budget flights on airlines including Wizz Air and 
Ryanair.
Accommodation is much cheaper than in other European capitals with hotels on offer for around £20 per person per 
night. Search for hotels and self-catered options on Booking.com.

Developers give update on Debenhams plans after 'slight delays'

Developers behind a major housing proposal for the city's former Debenhams department store have given an 
update on why full plans are yet to emerge.
In the summer, developers Stanford Real Estate and planning consultants Lanpro revealed their vision for the 
prominent city centre building, in Orford Place.
Dubbed "Orford House", the development would see almost an entirely new structure built with shops on the first 
two floors and 400 student flats on the other floors.
In a schedule laid out by Lanpro, a public consultation was to be held in June that would be followed by a full 
planning submission in August.
But four months later, a formal application is yet to be lodged with Norwich City Council.

Ben Burgess, Lanpro regional director, said: "Work is still progressing towards submission of a full application for 
Orford House but as is often the case with projects of this size some slight delays have been encountered.
"I would expect the application to be submitted in the near future."
The building opened in 1956 after the previous Curls Brothers store on the site was destroyed in a 1942 Second 
World War air raid.
The building had been home to Debenhams until it closed in May 2021 as the company closed 30 stores around the 
country.

Developers give update on Debenhams plans after 'slight delays'
As part of potential demolition plans, the existing building could be knocked down to all but the basement and 
ground floor.
The various sections of the building would vary in height, but at its tallest, it would be three storeys higher than the 
current, six-floor, building.
As well as its online application, Lanpro held a consultation event in association with Benchmark Architects at The 
Forum on Friday, June 23 to inform the final application.
However, a city council spokesman confirmed its planning department had not yet received plans from the 
developers.

We think of immigrants in economic terms, but what about emotionally?

Many decades ago my parents got a message from the post office to say that a woman in Australia had telephoned 
because she was concerned about a relative of ours who had arrived from Ireland and rented a room in her 
boarding house. He was in such a state of despair that she feared for his life.
I don t know how my parents dealt with this   like almost everyone else, they didn t have a telephone   but the man 
eventually went on to make a life for himself in Australia.
Thinking about him the other day it struck me that this scenario must be repeated in Ireland today for some of the 
immigrants who arrive here.
We often think of immigrants, refugees, even asylum seekers, in purely economic terms, but what s happening for 
them emotionally? How many experience the sort of despair that prompted that woman in Australia to ring an Irish 
post office?
Not all emigrants, as we know, cope successfully with their emotional pain. I have heard Irish people   and I don t 
mean tourists   shouting their angry, drunken way through Leicester Square in London and Downtown, Boston. I 
smiled ruefully and passed on.
We like to hear of successful emigration stories while the ones who were lost to alcoholism, homelessness or both 
have passed into the shadows.
Today s immigrants and even some refugees can, at least, visit home via Ryanair. But many   refugees and asylum 
seekers   may not ever go back to a home that will never be safe.
A 2017 report from the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland outlines what must be a crushing degree of pain for many 
of these people:  Asylum seekers have higher levels of psychopathology than the general population. They suffer 
higher rates of anxiety and depressive disorders than other sections of society. They have up to 10 times the level 
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to the indigenous population.
 Most refugees and asylum seekers have not survived a single clear-cut traumatic event, but a collection of 
negative experiences of war and oppression. A torture experience will not necessarily be clearly separated from the 
other experiences and for some torture was not their worst experience. 
We think of immigrants in economic terms, but what about emotionally?
A person who works with refugees told me of the reversal that some families experience. For instance, you are 
supposed to be the head of your family but you don t speak English well or at all. So, increasingly, it s your school-
going children who interpret the world for you and interpret you to the world.
UK search suggests that having to leave your family behind and the challenge of establishing yourself in your new 
country are sources of depression and anxiety.
Other pressures are more subtle and hardly ever seen by us, the  host  population, especially for immigrants who 
came here to work. Requests for money, along with the expectation that you will send it, can come from the home 
country as many an Irish emigrant experienced in the past. The assumption is made that you have money to spare.
Much of the income of the Irish economy came from emigrants. How many Irish people never or rarely came home 
from England because they were expected to throw money around when they got here and they couldn t admit they 
didn t have it?
On top of this, we have the increasing belligerence of the right wing, with their hatred of immigrants. If I was an 
immigrant and if I had read the reported messages that passed between the promoters of the recent violence in 
Dublin, I would be, at the very least, wary when going around and at worst fearful (especially if I was black or 
brown).
Perhaps I am painting too gloomy a picture. I have left out the bright spots and the success stories. But it is good, I 
think, to have a rounded and empathetic understanding of people who are here and will always be here.
And who, in many respects, are no different to how we used to be.

to make sure these recover that money from some of the airlines, I. Oh, and you're bringing in other action against 
them. Now, according to these results right is at fresh action It's it's the same. It's the same point it just relates to a 
different period of time, so we just need to make sure that I guess. Now the tiller just completed that we did back a 
good thing we could get everything is due back to was and I guess more why did ensure what you want to see in 
terms of colour. 
You've been pushing the regulators to look at the issue of refunds. Yeah, I think the the framework in the August 
quite clear I'm not sure it's always it too we we have a completely independent brings and trust account where our 
customer money goes before they go on holiday. that means that when there are problems, we have the financial 
flexibility to Reepham from it. We always do so in cash. that could be thinking to the parents in black customers 
there is framework in law to make sure this happens. I just think the. The regulators need to make sure there aren't 
opposition that It's always happening across the board and should be clear that the Ryanair kind of blame. 
Companies like yours this and say sort of exactly what you're saying in the opposite direction very quickly, then tell 
us what summer looks like. Yes, those that were great our we sent more than 10% more people about their summer 
holidays this year earlier but it's big stuff we're are looking like that again for the summer. Yeah, and it really 
promising, but for the summer. So, yeah, not as the picture doesn't it tells us, sometimes a little bit about how we're 
feeling about our spending power doesn't show more than group CEO on the beach. So much for your time time 
now 23 minutes past 7 Thank you will. You've probably heard of Grand theft Auto, Even if you've never allowed

and to tell us first for so many don't know anything about it, has never played it What is the appeal been so Grand 
theft Auto, is one of the most celebrated the against all time so it's made by Rockstar Games which is a studio that 
has a reputation for incredible world will be in look at storytelling and the the kind of the stories are something like 
the world Sopranos or the wire so criminal game lots of then heist, things like that and they are just games that you 
can fall into people spend hundreds even thousands about playing these games is it's satire, this I think that I the 
stories quite transgressive, you know, they are known for pushing boundaries. At least you know within the video 
games. Well, I think you if you watch the partners other while there's been much worse. But in video games. You 
know they said there they're quite transgressive stories and they are quite satirical and the humour very well is that 
the the key to it because I mean, you think of video games that I suppose what I would think of this as a brand is 
you think that being hugely successful and kind of violent but not in a way that other games aren't or indeed that 
films aren't and that being the attraction but actually the attraction is much more than that is much cleverer than 
that. Yes, absolutely. I think

Aena asks Iberia to abandon the handling war
Aena asks Iberia to abandon the handling war

Aena has called the awarded companies and airlines to sign the contracts for the new ground handling service 
licenses, so that they can start operating before the summer season "to ensure the quality of service to travelers". 
The airport manager has asked Iberia to accept "with greatness of spirit" that it has lost numerous licenses 
"because other companies presented better proposals" and to abandon "unedifying" attitudes that significantly 
hinder the transition process.
The company chaired by Maurici Lucena reacts in this way to the decision adopted last week by the Central 
Administrative Court of Contractual Resources (TACRC) to reject Iberia's appeal to stop the awarding of the tender 
and the signing of the new contracts, as EL PAÍS reported. After the rejection of the administrative appeal, the 
airline of the IAG group has one last bullet left, as it has filed an appeal before the Audiencia Nacional (National 
Court) requesting the annulment of the tender and the precautionary suspension of the new contracts until the 
process is settled.
The outcome of the tender, which was announced on September 26, was a severe blow to Iberia's business. The 
company lost all the major airports where it was present in terms of passenger traffic, except for Madrid-Barajas. 
Iberia Airport Services ceded the airports of Barcelona-El Prat, Palma de Mallorca, Malaga, Alicante, Gran Canaria, 
Tenerife Sur, Ibiza and Bilbao.
Despite the legal appeal, Aena has decided to continue with the process. To this end, it has convened the 
employers' association of handling companies (Aseata) and the Association of Airlines (ALA) operating in Spain to 
comply with the planned schedule of "a transition process as quickly as possible and with the least possible harm to 
passengers". In the next few days, a commercial dialogue will formally begin between licensed handling companies 
and airlines so that the latter contract their services or, on the contrary, decide to carry out the self-handling to 
which they are entitled by law, such as that already provided by companies like Ryanair and EasyJet.
Aena recalls that it designed and resolved the public tender for handling licenses by delegation of a public function, 
which emanates from a European directive and a Royal Decree. "In any public tender, by definition, the best 
technical and economic proposals win an award," justifies the airport manager. The airline Iberia had accused Aena 
of "obvious irregularities" in its appeal to the TACRC, an accusation rejected by Aena, which assures that the 
award, which will allow the operation of the service for a period of seven years with a value of more than 5,000 
million euros in revenue, was made "applying 100% objective, transparent and non-discriminatory selection 
criteria".
Labor dispute
Aena asks Iberia to abandon the handling war
In its attack against the airline, Aena considers it an "obvious contradiction in terms" that Iberia maintains that its 
handling proposals are the best and, simultaneously, "hesitates in the decision to carry out autohandling to the 
airlines of the IAG group".
Precisely, Iberia's doubt as to whether it will continue to provide this service to the airlines of the group or will 
subcontract it to the new companies awarded (Groundfource, Aviapartner, Menzies and Swissport, mainly) has 
unleashed a labor conflict among the more than 7,000 workers operating in the subsidiary Iberia Airport Services, 
who fear that their working conditions will worsen.
UGT and CC OO have jointly demanded Iberia to announce now the autohandling, as allowed by the tender, for all 
IAG airlines, without waiting for the judicial resolution, to ensure the jobs of around 3,000 employees, of which more 
than 1,000 operate at Barcelona-El Prat airport, and to reach agreements with other operators to maintain their 
working conditions, since by law these companies must subrogate the staff of the Iberia subsidiary that now 
provides this service.

Estonia: Some 220,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in November
TALLINN, Dec 05, BNS – Some 220,000 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in November, which is 6 
percent more compared with the same month of the previous year.
The increase in the number of passengers was thanks to a tighter flight schedule -- in November there were 91 
more scheduled flights than at the same time last year, while the number of seats on sale exceeded the figure 
recorded at the same time a year ago by 10 percent, the airport said.
Regular flights to 31 different destinations were operated out of Tallinn in November. The most popular direct flight 
destinations were traditionally the larger hubs of Frankfurt, Helsinki and Riga. The airline with the largest market 
share in November was Air Baltic, which carried every fourth passenger passing through Tallinn Airport. Air Baltic is 
flying to altogether 15 destinations from Tallinn during the winter season. With nine destinations, the next largest 
airline was Ryanair, whose flights were used by 14 percent of all passengers. Among the charter flights, the most 
popular destination was Egypt.
A total of 2,922 flight operations, meaning an average of 97 arrivals and departures per day, took place in 
November.
Eero Pargmae, a member of the management board of Tallinn Airport, said that active preparations are already 
underway today to put together the summer flight schedule for next year.
"We have previously announced the arrival of Transavia France in Estonia, which will start flights to Paris in April. In 
addition, Eurowings will also start flying from Tallinn as a new airline in the summer, connecting Tallinn with Prague 
3-4 times a week starting from the end of March. Eurowings is a German low-cost airline that is part of Lufthansa 
Group," Pargmae said.
Estonia : Some 220,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in November
Elsewhere in Estonia, regional airports served a total of 4,912 passengers in November -- 3,467 in Kuressaare and 
1,069 in Kardla. From November, it is once again possible to fly on the Parnu-Ruhnu-Kuressaare route with the 
airline Diamond Sky.

Repsol supplies sustainable biofuel to Atlas Air and Inditex for cargo flights
Repsol supplies sustainable biofuel to Atlas Air and Inditex for cargo flights

Repsol has begun supplying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Atlas Air for the cargo flights that this company 
performs for Inditex from Zaragoza airport. Since the beginning of November, Atlas Air has been using 5% of this 
green fuel on all its flights.
New York-based Atlas Air becomes the first cargo airline to regularly incorporate biofuels in its operations in Spain. 
This initiative not only marks a significant step forward in the industry, but also strategically positions them to 
comply with regulations set forth by ReFuelEU Aviation. These regulations call for the use of 2% renewable fuels by 
2025, 6% by 2030 and, ultimately, 70% by 2050.
Repsol has established similar agreements with other airlines, such as Iberia and Ryanair. The collaboration 
between the oil company and the Spanish airline was highlighted by an important milestone: the first long-range 
flight between Madrid and Washington, which operated with renewable fuel produced from waste at the Petronor 
industrial complex. In addition, both companies have joined forces to offer the airline's corporate customers the 
possibility of purchasing this sustainable fuel.
On the other hand, the oil company will supply 155,000 tons of sustainable fuel to the Irish airline Ryanair between 
2025 and 2030. This amount is equivalent to more than 28,000 flights between Dublin and Madrid, thus achieving 
an estimated reduction of 490,000 tons of CO2 emissions.
During the course of this year, Repsol also established a collaboration with Gestair to introduce biofuels in the 
business aviation sector. In addition, it formalized an agreement with the Air and Space Army, allowing the Eagle 
Patrol to use, for the first time in the air parade on Columbus Day, a renewable fuel produced by Repsol.
In this line, the oil company is about to inaugurate the first advanced biofuels plant in Spain, located in Cartagena 
(Murcia). This plant has the capacity to produce 250,000 tons of renewable fuels from waste, contributing to 
Repsol's goal of reaching a production capacity of 1.3 million tons of renewable fuels by 2025 and more than 2 
million tons by 2030. In this way, Repsol leads the market in the Iberian Peninsula and is making decisive progress 
towards the goal of zero net emissions by 2050.
Land, sea and air
Repsol has alliances to supply biofuels to road transport: with Leroy Merlin, XPO, Tragsa, Avanza, Alsa, Grupo 
Sesé, Serveto and Carreras. In May, it started supplying 100% renewable diesel at three service stations in Madrid, 
Barcelona and Lisbon. By the end of this year, a total of 50 service stations will be dispensing advanced biofuel in 
the main cities and transport corridors of the Iberian Peninsula.
Repsol supplies sustainable biofuel to Atlas Air and Inditex for cargo flights
It also has a collaboration agreement with Navantia to jointly develop innovative solutions for maritime transport. 
Both companies are studying the performance of the new low-carbon liquid fuels that the oil company will supply to 
the shipbuilder.

Low-Cost Carrier Market is Expected to Globally Reach USD 595.1bn by 
2032, According to Allied Market Research
Airline Industry Information

Allied Market Research has published a report, titled, "Low-Cost Carrier Market by Aircraft Type (Narrow Body 
Aircraft and Wide Body Aircraft), Destination (Domestic and International), and Haul (Short Haul and Long Haul): 
Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2022-2032," the firm said.
According to the report, the global low-cost carrier industry size generated USD 196.1bn in 2022, and is anticipated 
to generate USD 595.1bn by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 12.1% from 2023 to 2032.
Factors such as liberalization of aviation markets and open skies agreements, low maintenance costs associated 
with aircraft, and growth of the tourism industry drive the growth of the low-cost carrier market. 
However, high competition, and fluctuations in fuel prices hinder the growth of the market. 
Furthermore, innovative service offerings from low-cost airlines, and adoption of latest technologies by LCCs for 
ticket sales, check-ins, baggage processing offer remarkable growth opportunities for the players operating in the 
low-cost carrier market.
Impact of Russia-Ukraine War
The closure of airspace around the conflict zone in Eastern Europe has led low-cost carriers to cancel flights to 
nearby destinations resulting in revenue declines from lost ticket sales.
The economic ripple effects such as rise in consumer prices across Europe and supply chain issues may reduce 
discretionary spending on travel in the near-term limiting passenger growth for low-cost airlines.
The narrow body aircraft segment to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period
Low-Cost Carrier Market is Expected to Globally Reach USD 595.1bn by 2032, According to Allied Market 
Research
On the basis of aircraft type, the narrow body segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly 
four-fifths of the global low-cost carrier market revenue, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status during the 
forecast period. 
The segment is also expected to register the highest CAGR of 12.3% from 2023 to 2032. 
Narrow body aircraft typically have a single aisle and are well-suited for short to medium-haul routes, providing an 
ideal solution for carriers focusing on point-to-point travel. These aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 
families, offer a balance between fuel efficiency and passenger capacity.
The domestic segment to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period
On the basis of destination, the domestic segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly 
three-fourths of the global low-cost carrier market revenue, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status during 
the forecast period. 
Domestic routes remain the largest market for low-cost carriers, especially major players such as Southwest 
Airlines Co. in the US, Ryanair group in Europe, and AirAsia which have built significant market share on regional 
routes by stimulating demand with affordability. 
Moreover, government aviation firms have sought investments to further expand domestic air networks.
The international segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 13.6% from 2023 to 2032. The international 
segment in the low-cost carrier market encompasses air travel services that connect cities and regions across 
different countries. 
Low-cost carriers operating in the international segment provide cost-effective options for passengers seeking 
affordable travel beyond national borders.
The short haul segment to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period
On the basis of haul, the short haul segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly three-
fourths of the global low-cost carrier market revenue, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status during the 
forecast period. 
The growth of regional economic integration and increased tourism activities contribute significantly to the growth of 
short haul LCCs. 
These carriers play a pivotal role in connecting cities and regions, fostering economic activities, and promoting 
tourism within specific geographical areas. Short haul LCCs enable travelers to explore nearby destinations 
conveniently, stimulating both business and leisure travel.
The long-haul segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 13.4% from 2023 to 2032. Long haul airlines 
used to be the dominant players in the long-haul market, but long-haul LCCs have started to change that. 
These carriers concentrate on offering long distance travel options that are reasonably priced by utilizing 
developments in aircraft technology. The increase in need for direct and reasonably priced connections on longer 
routes has driven the growth of the segment.
Asia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2032
Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for nearly two-
fifths of the global low-cost carrier market revenue. 
Asia-Pacific is also expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 13.1% from 2023 to 2032. Rapid economic 
development in Asia-Pacific. has seen aviation emerge as a key regional connectivity enabler with low-cost carriers 
at the forefront leveraging the price-sensitive, fast-growing middle class and youth demographic. 
Low-Cost Carrier Market is Expected to Globally Reach USD 595.1bn by 2032, According to Allied Market 
Research
AirAsia, IndiGo, Cebu Pacific are among leading low-fare airlines stimulated by progressive policy reforms. 
Moreover, large populations in China, India, and Indonesia provide scale economies that improve international 
viability while catering to sizable captive domestic audiences.
Recent Developments: 
In April 2022, The Jetstar Group entered into a collaboration with IndiGo, allowing Jetstar customers to book 
connections and flights on IndiGo services through its Jetstar Connect platform.
In May 2023, Ryanair Holdings plc placed an order for 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft scheduled for delivery 
between 2027 and 2033. This strategic move aims to expand its fleet and enhance its market presence.
Key Highlights: 
The low-cost carrier industry report comprehensively examines segments including narrow-body aircraft and wide-
body aircraft. The analysis spans different regions, encompassing North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and 
LAMEA.
Integrating high-quality data, professional insights, and critical independent perspectives, the study adopts a 
research approach aimed at providing a well-rounded view of global markets. The goal is to assist stakeholders in 
making informed decisions to achieve their ambitious growth objectives.

Dear Chairman Kean,
Esteemed members of the Subcommittee,
Let me start with the words of gratitude to the US Congress and the American people for supporting the democratic 
aspirations of the Belarusian people for many years. I do believe that one day Belarus will become a truly 
independent, democratic country, reliable partner, member of the European Union and Trans-Atlantic Community. 
To achieve this goal, we have to dismantle the illegitimate regime of dictator Alexander Lukashenka, who has been 
ruling the country for 29 years.
In 2020, Belarusians made a clear choice in favor of democracy, freedom, and human rights. According to 
observers and alternative vote count, Belarusians resolutely voted down corruption, lawlessness, and 
incompetence. Instead, they voted for values of democracy, freedom and human dignity. I won that election. 
However, the dictator refused to step down, and instigated the terror against Belarusians. Security services 
detained protestors en masse. We have credible reports of torture, abuse and inhumane treatment in detention 
centers. The police also cracked down on journalists, civil society activists, and opposition figures.
More than 60 thousand people got imprisoned. At least 20 people were killed, thousands were tortured. Hundreds 
of thousands were forced to flee the country, including myself. The repressions against the general population can 
be classified as crimes against humanity, according to the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights. At least 1500 
political prisoners remain behind bars as I speak, including my husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski who was sentenced 
to 19,5 years in prison. Including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Ales Bialiatski, my colleague Maria Kalesnikava, 
presidential hopeful Viktar Babaryka, activist Palina Sharenda-Panasiuk, journalist Ihar Losik and others.
Feeling impunity, the regime of the dictator Lukashenka became a threat to the entire region. It hijacked the Ryanair 
flight to kidnap the dissident journalist, it orchestrated the migration crisis on the border with Lithuania, Poland and 
House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe Hearing "The Future of Freedom and Democracy in Belarus ." 
Testimony by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, National Leader o....
Latvia. Finally, it dragged our country into the Russian criminal war against Ukraine, providing it with weapons, 
infrastructure, training, and territory. All of that happened against the will of the Belarusian people.
Lukashenka's regime allowed Russia to deploy Russian troops and nuclear weapons on our territory. We have 
evidence that the dictator also participated in the abduction of Ukrainian children from the occupied territories. 
There is an ongoing attack on Belarusian culture, language and national identity. Belarus becomes more and more 
dependent on Russia.
However, Belarusian people don't want their country to be a Russian proxy and an accomplice in the war. 
Belarusians support Ukraine, and they want to have a good relationship with all neighbors. Since the beginning of 
the full-scale invasion, Belarusians organized a pro-Ukraine movement that has taken many forms. Railway 
partisans stopped trains with Russian military equipment. Many people went to Ukraine as military volunteers to join 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, and formed the largest foreigners' unit within UAF, the "Kalinouski Regiment".
Belarusians see their country as free and independent. Only 4.5% of Belarusians support the unification with 
Russia. Despite brainwashing propaganda, Belarusians remain dedicated to the idea of independent and 
democratic Belarus, free of oppression and tyranny, with strong national identity and a thriving private sector.
As the President-elect, I continue to perform my duties from exile. Together with civil society and political groups, 
we have formed alternative institutions of power, such as the United Transitional Cabinet, which is the executive 
body, and the Coordination Council. I represent Belarusians on the international arena meeting the world leaders 
and participating in the international fora on behalf of our nation. I am urging the international partners to distinguish 
between the regime and the people of Belarus, between Belarus and Russia, to support the democratic movement 
of Belarus.
I understand that democratic transition in Belarus is a task for Belarusians, but we can't do it alone. We need 
support from the United States.
I call on the United States to elaborate, in concert with other nations, an action plan to support the efforts of 
Belarusians to preserve independence and restore democracy in Belarus. Appointment of a US Special Envoy on 
Belarus would be a step in this direction. We call for setting up a coalition for independent democratic Belarus in 
which the US could take a lead.
This coalition should demand full removal of the Russian military from Belarus and a complete seizure of any 
involvement of Belarus in the war against Ukraine, to counter the Kremlin's encroachment on Belarusian 
sovereignty and national identity. This should include imposing sanctions and non-recognizing agreements signed 
by the regime with Russia after the 2020 elections. There is an urgent need to introduce sanctions against Russia 
for its illegal attempts to subjugate Belarus and to instrumentalize it in the confrontation with our European 
neighbors.
We should not allow Belarus to become a consolation prize to Putin. Belarus should not become a bargaining chip 
in any negotiations with Russia. "Nothing about Belarus without Belarusians" must be an absolute principle. Our 
presence will ensure that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Belarus are upheld consistently 
and principally. I applaud the US decision to launch the Strategic Dialogue with Belarusian democratic forces.
The US and its partners should support human rights efforts by monitoring the situation, providing aid to the victims 
and vulnerable groups facing repressions, financing initiatives and foundations that help political prisoners and their 
families, and supporting human rights education programs. International mechanisms within OHCHR must be 
maintained and strengthened. Given the gravity of the situation with political prisoners, it is imperative to create a 
bilateral US-Belarus working group to develop a strategy for the release of political prisoners and extension of 
support to work with them. Among other decisions, this group should lead to the creation of an international fund to 
help political prisoners.
House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe Hearing "The Future of Freedom and Democracy in Belarus ." 
Testimony by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, National Leader o....
I call on the United States to increase the isolation of the regime and the pressure exerted on it. Economic 
sanctions are not a silver bullet, but a tool to weaken the regime and its ability to conduct repressions and assist 
Russians in the war. It is crucial to strengthen sanctions on the military industrial complex supporting the Russian 
war, on the banking and financial sector. The sanctions must be coordinated with the EU, UK, Canada, and 
Belarusian democratic forces.
The current sanctions don't work in full due to loopholes, so it's crucial not just to impose them but also monitor and 
enforce them. I ask to consider the secondary sanctions on those who help to bypass sanctions, based on 
Executive Order 14038, and to harmonize trade sanctions against Russia and Lukashenka.
The US can take a more active role in bringing the dictator and his cronies to account. The US could submit country 
referrals in ICC and ICJ on a number of cases, including the unlawful displacement of children, deportation or 
forcible transfer of civilian population, cases against the regime's officials under the universal jurisdiction, crime of 
persecution, etc.
While isolating the regime in Minsk, it is crucial to support democratic forces - to strengthen agency and ability to 
deliver practical results to the benefit of Belarusians inside and outside Belarus. The US can increase its assistance 
to Belarusian democratic institutions, civil society, independent media, and cultural initiatives. The US aid to Belarus 
amounts to 30 million USD a year approximately, while Russian aid to sustain Lukashenka's regime is in billions. 
The international aid to the democratic Belarus is enough to subsist, but we need resources to win.
All dictatorships fell, and Lukashenka's dictatorship will fall too. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare Belarus to 
democratic transition, by developing a plan for the country's economic recovery. We will need to rebuild Belarus 
after decades of poor management and tyranny, after repressions and Russian dominance. We will need to 
reconcile the nation and integrate it in the international economy.
Belarusians must know that, as a part of democratic transition, Belarus will be given all the necessary assistance to 
conduct economic and political reforms. Please help us to advance the agenda of democratic, independent, pro-
European Belarus.
The path to freedom and democracy may be long and difficult. But this path is the only right one. I ask the United 
States to stand with free and independent Belarus.

For low-cost airlines, the entire business model is based on luring customers with a base fare for significantly lower 
than what is offered by other airlines and then making up for the difference with extra fees for things that are also 
normally covered. While someone traveling alone for a weekend in a nearby city with...

 European shares dipped yesterday as they paused for breath after a strong showing last week, with miners and 
energy among the weakest performers as they were hurt by weak commodity prices.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1 per cent, after touching a fresh four-month high in early trade and posting 
its third straight weekly gain on Friday.
 DUBLIN The Iseq declined 
 0.4 per cent to 8.431.07. Banking stocks were in focus, with AIB and Bank of Ireland declined by 0.7 per cent 
each to EUR 4.33 and EUR 8.56, respectively, as sector followers continued to speculate on where interest rates 
are headed.
European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos said yesterday that while a drop in euro zone inflation last 
month to 2.4 per cent (compared to a peak of 10.6 per cent in late 2022) was a  positive surprise , any future 
decisions on interest rates will depend on reality on the ground.
Ryanair edged 0.2 per cent higher to EUR 18.05 as the carrier reported that its passenger traffic increased  4 per 
cent in November.
 LONDON The FTSE 100 eased 
 0.2 per cent as heavyweight energy and mining stocks fell after a stronger dollar and concerns about China s 
economy dragged  oil and metal prices.
Energy giants Shell and BP fell more than 1 per cent as oil prices dipped, pressured by investor scepticism over 
the latest Opec+ decision on supply cuts and uncertainty surrounding global fuel demand.
European shares pause for breath
London-listed miners such as Glencore, Rio Tinto and Anglo American slid 2.7-3.7 per cent as copper prices fell 
against a firm dollar, with further pressure coming from an increase in stocks in London Metal Exchange 
warehouses and resurfacing doubts over Chinese demand prospects.
Shares of Rolls-Royce rose 3.1 per cent to touch a more than four-year high after JP Morgan upgraded the 
engineering firm from neutral to overweight.
 EUROPE
 Europe s Stoxx 600 has risen nearly 10 per cent year-to- date, underperforming the US benchmark S&P 500 s 
near- 20 per cent jump, which was also aided by strong enthusiasm around AI stocks and better- than-expected 
third-quarter earnings.
Among individual stocks, Nokia fell 6.5 per cent, with an analyst pointing to market speculation indicating AT&T 
may remove the Finnish provider of mobile network technology from its vendor list.
Roche gained 2.8 per cent after agreeing to take over obesity drug developer Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion 
(EUR 2.5 billion).
Chipmaker ASM International fell 6.4 to the bottom of Stoxx 600, dragging tech stocks 0.8 per cent lower.
Meanwhile, Greece s 10- year government bond yield   or market interest rate   touched its lowest level (3.57 per 
cent) since June after rating agency Fitch upgraded its sovereign rating to investment grade.
 NEW YORK Wall Street shares were 
 lower in early-afternoon trading, after rallying last week, on caution ahead of a slew of economic data due this 
week that will likely  test the narrative of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by early next year.
Shares of Alaska Air Group dropped after the carrier said on Sunday it would acquire  Hawaiian Holdings for 
$1.9 billion, including debt. Hawaiian s shares nearly tripled.
Analysts have, however, alluded to the possibility of a Santa Claus rally as equities rebound from a likely mid-
December low due to tax-loss harvesting   a process in which investors sell underperforming stocks to lock in tax 
benefits.
Cryptocurrency firms rose, as bitcoin crossed $40,000 for the first time this year.   Additional reporting: Reuters

ONLINE travel agent On The Beach says it will continue to "pursue Ryanair for further sums", after winning a £2 
million court case over refunds for flights cancelled by the airline.
On The Beach was awarded £2 million in October after it said it had to refund customers' flights as Ryanair did not 
do so.
"This common sense outcome should not have taken a protracted and expensive legal process to resolve," it said. 
The travel agent said it had been forced to pay more refunds since the case began, and it was now trying to chase 
claims for these.
Ryanair itself took legal action against On The Beach in 2010 over an intellectual property dispute, but the case has 
still not progressed to court. On The Beach says "final resolution of the dispute might take some time".
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.
The travel agent also revealed its profits increased sixfold to £12.9 million in the year to 30 September. The shares 
gained 17.6p, or 15%, to 135p.
CEO Shaun Morton said it had seen "the majority of consumers protect - not sacrifice - their holiday, a trend our 
research shows will continue".

RYANAIR cancelled 960 flights in November due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, it has been revealed.
In a report, the low-cost airline said it flew 11.7m passengers in November, a four per cent increase on the prior 
year and taking its 2023 total to 180.8m.
However, the number marks a significant dip in October's figure of 17.1m. Load factor, the proportion of seats filled 
by passengers, sat at 92 per cent.
Airline shares dipped after Hamas invaded Israel last month, amid investor concern over route offerings and a spike 
in oil prices. The Irish carrier already cancelled over 870 flights in October due to the violence in the Middle East.
Ryanair has been one of the few major carriers to see shares continue rising in the quieter autumn months, 
following this summer's record season of travel.
Budget rival Wizz Air reported a more measured fall in November's passenger numbers, carrying 4.8m passengers, 
down from 5.4m the prior month.
Chief executive of Wizz Air, József Váradi told City A.M. that the war had created a "ripple effect" on demand 
across neighbouring countries.

RYANAIR and Wizz Air said passenger numbers soared in November as the travel sector continued its post-
pandemic bounce back.
Customers rushed to book holidays despite the cost-ofliving squeeze with travel remaining a top priority for many 
families, the low-cost carriers said.
Analysts said travellers are still 'making up for opportunities lost' during the pandemic. Wizz Air carried 4.8m 
passengers last month, which was 29.3pc more than November last year. Its load factor - which measures the 
percentage of available seats that have been sold - was 88.4pc during the month.
Over the last 12 months, 59.5m passengers have flown with Wizz Air, an increase of 34.9pc on the previous year.
Meanwhile, Ryanair reported a 4pc jump in passenger numbers to 11.7m and a load factor of 92pc in November. 
The airline has had 180.8m passengers in the last 12 months, up 14pc on 158.4m the year before.

LOW-cost airline Ryanair has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel 
and Hamas.
It comes after the carrier cancelled over 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in Gaza.
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7, and due to the subsequent escalation of the war. Rival easyJet said last week that conflict and 
the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected demand for flights in destinations such as Egypt, 
while it saw bookings impacted across the board in October and November due to the war.
Ryanair's latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4% increase in 
people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said yesterday that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until 
early January next year.
The budget airline said it 'continues to monitor the situation on the ground closely'.

IRISH STOCK REPORT
Ryanair Holdings (I:RY4B), Ireland's largest Airline company by market cap, has soared 47.4% Year To Date. 
There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2024 and beyond 
as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Ryanair Holdings. However, there are several key 
reasons why some investors remain bullish on the short-term prospects for Ryanair Holdings.
Below are some of those key reasons:
- Ryanair Holdings' share price has lifted 2.4% from its previous trading session to close at EUR18.0.- The volume 
was 1.4 times the average daily trading volume of 1.8 million shares.- The stock has a 1-month relative price 
strength of 94 indicating it is outperformed 94% of the market. A price rise combined with a high relative strength is 
a bullish signal. - The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving 
Average (EMA) of 17.4 minus the 26-day EMA of 16.8 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. The price to 50-day 
EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. - Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish 
signal.- The stock is up in last 3 days 3.2%, 3.9% for last 5 days and 22.9% for past month.
However, there is at least one reason investors may remain bearish in the short-term:
- The stock is trading below both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of 16.4 is lower than the 200-day MAP of 16.8, a 
bearish indicator.

Highlight: Passengers claimed they were forced to pay extra to obtain a digital pass
Body
Ryanair  has denied claims from passengers that it has introduced a “scandalous” extra fee to obtain a digital 
boarding pass.  
Travellers using the budget airline  said they had been charged up to £21 to book a seat on their flight, in order to 
access their e-boarding pass.
Those who refused to pay the fee claimed that they were forced to queue for a paper pass at the airport. 
But a spokesperson for Ryanair denied that the airline had introduced the charge, despite furious complaints from 
passengers on social media. 
One passenger travelling from London to Belfast on Monday tweeted: “When and why did you start this carry on? I 
now have to QUEUE to collect my boarding pass at the airport.”
Another passenger said: “I just can't believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass 
(mobile or print-out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to do so for no 
other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous.”
And another passenger posted a screenshot of their app after checking in, with a message reading: "Get your 
boarding pass now and avoid queueing at the airport by adding a seat".
They wrote alongside the image: "Charging for a mobile boarding pass? You are ridiculous."
Ryanair denies introducing 'scandalous' boarding pass fee after passenger complaints
Ryanair passengers are usually provided with their digital boarding pass for free via their app. There is a separate 
fee for travellers wishing to book a specific seat on the flight. 
A spokesperson for Ryanair said in a statement: “There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass – ever. 
"All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they 
can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge.”
Ryanair is known for its low fares  but has also been criticised for its numerous add-on charges. 
This includes a fee for putting luggage in the hold, booking a seat and requesting a seat with extra legroom. 
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary  has defended the airline's hidden fees, saying they are essential in order to keep 
fares low. 
Consumer rights expert Martyn James told the BBC that the new fee was likely a malfunction on Ryanair’s 
computer or booking systems. 
“If this new charge is true, then it's something of a false economy for Ryanair, as they'll need an awful lot more staff 
on the check-in desks to print off all of those boarding passes," he said.
“However, this latest news story highlights a glaringly unfair scenario that's been allowed to continue for far too 
long. Passengers should not have to pay for reserving a 'standard' seat at all. Speedy boarding, more legroom, 
premium -fine. But you should not have to pay to sit next to a loved one."

Highlight: Budget airline Ryanair came under fire from customers claiming they are being charged between £8 and 
£21 for a seat to get their boarding pass – but spokesperson says there is 'no charge for boarding pass – ever'
Body
Holidaymakers have spoken out in fury after claiming budget airline Ryanair had introduced a new charge. A small 
number of passengers claimed they were being forced to pay for a seat in order to download an e-boarding pass, or 
face queuing up at the airport. 
However, the airline has hit back at the 'false' reports. A spokesperson told the Daily Star: "These reports are false. 
There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass – ever. All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if 
they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of 
charge.:"
The airline is notorious for charging for heaps of add-ons from checked luggage to cabin bags, drinks and snacks 
on board, seat selection, priority boarding and more. Airlines have previously stated that digital passes allow them 
to hire fewer check-in agents which saves them money and keeps costs down. This is part of what lets them sell 
flights at such low prices.

Ryanair has already come under fire for charging Brits £55 per person to print off their boarding passes if they don’t 
check in online. This fee is applied to prevent large queues at the airport for check-in. Earlier this year, a woman 
took to Twitter, now known as X, in fury after her elderly parents were charged the added fee. She said her parents 
"in their 70s and 80s" made a mistake when downloading their boarding passes to their mobiles.
Ryanair hits back at 'false' claims that it's introducing a new fee for passengers
To be able to board the flight they then had to shell out £110 for "two pieces of paper". The rule means that the 
latest change to Ryanair policy, which will cause more queues at check-in is confusing for some.
A Ryanair spokesperson told Daily Star at the time: "In accordance with Ryanair’s T&C’s, which these passengers 
agreed to at the time of booking, they failed to check-in online before arriving at Stansted airport 11 Aug despite 
receiving an email reminder 10 Aug to check-in online. These passengers were correctly charged the airport check-
in fee £55 per pax.
"All passengers travelling with Ryanair agree to check-in online before arriving at their departure airport and all 
passengers are sent an email/SMS, reminding them to do so 24hrs before departure. We regret that these 
passengers ignored their email reminder and failed to check-in online."

Ryanair has been criticised for a "ridiculous" and "disgraceful" add-on charge where some customers are reportedly 
having to pay a fee to access their digital boarding pass.
The budget airline already charges for add-ons such as checked baggage and booking a seat in advance.
Now it appears that some are being stuck with having to pay a fee to access their digital boarding pass, otherwise 
they will have to queue to collect a printed one from the airport.
Passengers have shared screenshots on X (formerly Twitter), with the airline-s app instructing them to select a 
random seat in advance at a cost of between 8 and 21 if they wish to download their digital boarding pass.
@Ryanair I just can-t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass (mobile or print-
out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to do so for no other reason for 
you to make a few quid. Scandalous. pic.twitter.com/48SMNrbMSV
- Ell- To Pay (@Ell2Pay) December 2, 2023
Airport staff told The Mail on Sunday the change, which has been rolled out in recent days, had caused outrage 
with affected customers.
How did Ryanair passengers react to digital boarding pass charge?
One Ryanair customer posted online: "I just can-t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a 
boarding pass (mobile or print-out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to 
do so for no other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous."
Another person shared: "@askryanair I know that you're cheap but forcing me to pay for a seat or having to go to 
the airport early to collect a boarding pass in person is RIDICULOUS".

Frustration was evident among many people, with another posting: "@Ryanair why have I now got to buy a seat to 
access a digital boarding pass that was free for years you're disgraceful and do nothing but congest airports and

Highlight: Ryanair passengers claimed that they were being charged up to £21 for a seat in order to get an e-
boarding pass but the budget airline has hit back at the 'false' reports
Body
                     Ryanair has denied reports it has started charging customers a new fee for e-boarding passes. 
A small number of passengers with the budget airline claimed they had to fork out up to £21 for a seat booking if 
they wanted an e-boarding pass, or face having to queue at the airport to get their ticket. However, the airline has 
slammed the claims as 'false'. 
A spokesperson for Ryanair told the Mirror: "These reports are false. There is no charge for a Ryanair digital 
boarding pass - ever. All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to 
avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge." 
If you are due to fly with Ryanair, it is worth noting that you'll need to check-in online two hours or more before your 
flight -or you'll face a fee to check-in at the airport. CEO Michael O'Leary has said multiple times that the £65 fee is 
levied to stop people checking-in in person at the airport, as doing so requires additional staff. 
                     Have you been hit by the new fee Email webtravel@reachplc.com                   
Most airlines require passengers to check-in online and then allow them to download a pass. Customers can 
usually pick up a printed copy from the airport free of charge, whether from an airline staff member or from a self-
service machine.
Ryanair hits back at 'false' reports it's charging passengers to get e-boarding passes
The airline has gained a reputation in recent years for levying charges on their customers. Unzela Khan recently 
ended up having to pay £220 to check-in at Luton Airport, based on each of her party being charged £55 each. She 
told MyLondon that her family had booked a holiday to Naples, Italy, and paid around £200 for the flights.
The family arrived at Luton Airport on November 3 and thought all was well until they got to the front of the check-in 
desk queue. "We reached the check-in desk, weighed our bags and discussed checking in the baby car seat and 
pushchair. Then, the Ryanair employee said: 'That'll be £55.' Confused, we asked why and were told it was 
because we hadn't checked in online."
Despite the family's protests, they were told it would cost £220 for the four of them, although the baby could fly for 
no extra cost. If they couldn't afford to stump up, they weren't allowed to fly. "Anyway, we begrudgingly had to pay 
the £220 which is a whole adult ticket to Italy while listening to another family next to us going through the same 
shock and horror," Unzela said.
Ryanair's website states that "You can check in for your flight at the airport, but you will have to pay an airport 
check-in fee per passenger to cover the extra cost of the airport check-in service." If you fail to check-in online two 
hours or more before your plane departs, then you will be charged the fee, even if you can do so at the airport.

Ryanair has been criticised for a "ridiculous" and "disgraceful" add-on charge where some customers are reportedly 
having to pay a fee to access their digital boarding pass.
The budget airline already charges for add-ons such as checked baggage and booking a seat in advance.
Now it appears that some are being stuck with having to pay a fee to access their digital boarding pass, otherwise 
they will have to queue to collect a printed one from the airport.
Passengers have shared screenshots on X (formerly Twitter), with the airline-s app instructing them to select a 
random seat in advance at a cost of between 8 and 21 if they wish to download their digital boarding pass.
@Ryanair I just can-t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass (mobile or print-
out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to do so for no other reason for 
you to make a few quid. Scandalous. pic.twitter.com/48SMNrbMSV

The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Audiencia Nacional is requesting the conviction of the airline Ryanair for 
having violated the right to strike of workers belonging to the collective of cabin crew members (TCPS) in the 
stoppages called by the Unión Sindical Obrera (USO) and by the Sindicato Independiente de Tripulantes de 
Tripulantes de Cabina de Pasajeros de Líneas Aéreas (Sitcpla) between June 2022 and January 2023. The 
statement issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office also calls for the conviction of two other companies, 
subcontractors of the airline, for the same reason: Crewlink Ireland LTD and Workforce International Contractors 
LTD.
The strikes were called as a result of repeated claims of job insecurity. It was resolved in a trial held on November 
29, 2023 by the Social Chamber of the National Court that Ryanair "repeatedly and repeatedly carried out acts 
aimed at hindering and preventing the legitimate exercise of the right to strike through acts of different nature". The 
way in which the company acted to hinder the development of the strikes, according to the statement, was through 
the lack of information to workers about the scheduled flights, the abusive designation of the number of workers for 
the provision of minimum services, the use of workers from third states and the warning of disciplinary dismissals.
The unions took the first actions against Ryanair after it failed to comply with the Minimum Services Resolution 
established by the Ministry of Transport on the first strike days scheduled for June 24, 25 and 26 of this year. 
According to the complaint, Ryanair maintained as protected flights all those that were already scheduled, which 
resulted in an illegal setting of 100% of the minimum services. The unions USO and Sitcpla indicated that Ryanair 
workers had to operate those flights by obligation under the guise of minimum services, so they could not exercise 
their right to strike.
Another complaint was filed with the Special Directorate of Labor Inspection and Social Security against the airline 
by USO and Sitcpla, which brought to the attention "multiple irregularities" that Ryanair had committed "with total 
impunity", such as the assignment of guards, both at home and at home.
Background
In the middle of this year, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal that Ryanair and the two associated firms 
Crewlink Ireland Ltd and Workforce Contractors Ltd filed against the 2021 General Court judgment. This body 
declared that the companies violated the workers' right to strike The stoppages had been called for 10 days in 
The Public Prosecutor's Office asks the Audiencia Nacional to condemn Ryanair for violating the right to strike.
September 2019. For this episode, the high court upheld the compensation to the trade unions UNO-STA and 
Sticpla for the violation of the rights of freedom of association, with the sum of 30,000 euros for each of them.
The decision also obliged the condemned companies to reimburse the workers who took part in the strike with the 
monthly productivity bonus in the amount of 150 euros, from which only the sum of 5 euros could be deducted for 
each day of participation in the strike.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday Ryanair spokesman said: "Passengers have the choice of choosing a seat for a 
small fee or be randomly allocated a seat free of charge."
The latest fee does not appear to affect all travellers, with some saying they got a digital boarding pass for free.

Ryanair has been criticised for a "ridiculous" and "disgraceful" add-on charge where some customers are reportedly 
having to pay a fee to access their digital boarding pass.
The budget airline already charges for add-ons such as checked baggage and booking a seat in advance.
Now it appears that some are being stuck with having to pay a fee to access their digital boarding pass, otherwise 
they will have to queue to collect a printed one from the airport.
Passengers have shared screenshots on X (formerly Twitter), with the airline-s app instructing them to select a 
random seat in advance at a cost of between 8 and 21 if they wish to download their digital boarding pass.

Ryanair breaks silence after claims passengers charged £21 to download boarding pass 
Ryanair has dismissed the reports about the change to its charging policy and added that passengers have never 
been asked to pay to download boarding passes. The airline company had to issue a statement after there were 
several reports of the airline charging its passengers a fee of £21 to download the boarding pass.
Breaking its silence on the issue, the company said that all these allegations are false even though many travellers 
have complained on social media that they have had to pay a “scandalous” new fee to access their boarding 
passes online.
Many said that they were only able to download the electronic pass if they paid up to £21 for a seat first. The 
alternative was to queue for a paper boarding pass at the airport.
A Ryanair spokesperson said: “All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers 
wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge.”
However, several passengers have complained on social media that if they chose the option of a randomly 
allocated seat they were told they would have to pick up a paper boarding pass at the airport, a problem first 
reported in the Mail on Sunday two days ago.
A series of indignant posts on X, formerly Twitter, have addressed Ryanair directly. One wrote: “When and why did 
you start this carry on? I now have to QUEUE to collect my boarding pass at the airport?"
Another passenger said: "I just can't believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass 
unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue to do so for no other reason for you to make a few 
quid. Scandalous."
Ryanair breaks silence after claims passengers charged £21 to download boarding pass
"This definitely happened to me," said Neil Buckley, who flew to Riga with Ryanair at the weekend and said he felt 
forced to pay £15.50 for reserved seats - the equivalent of 10 percent of the ticket price. The app said if I opted for a 
free random seat I'd have to go to check-in to get a paper boarding pass, which I've never seen before." 
The budget airline already charges extra for additional hand luggage, hold luggage and boarding pass printing, like 
most other carriers.
Brits travelling abroad or within the UK should be aware that airlines often add extra charges, for services such as 
putting luggage in the hold, booking a specific seat and requesting a seat with extra legroom.

Passengers have shared screenshots on X (formerly Twitter), with the airline-s app instructing them to select a 
random seat in advance at a cost of between 8 and 21 if they wish to download their digital boarding pass.
@Ryanair I just can-t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass (mobile or print-
out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to do so for no other reason for 
you to make a few quid. Scandalous. pic.twitter.com/48SMNrbMSV

Airport staff told The Mail on Sunday the change, which has been rolled out in recent days, had caused outrage 
with affected customers.
How did Ryanair passengers react to digital boarding pass charge?
One Ryanair customer posted online: "I just can-t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a 
boarding pass (mobile or print-out) unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue (30m or longer) to 
do so for no other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous."
Ryanair passengers slam 'disgraceful' and 'ridiculous' new add-on charge
Another person shared: "@askryanair I know that you're cheap but forcing me to pay for a seat or having to go to 
the airport early to collect a boarding pass in person is RIDICULOUS".

- Denis (@the_kneeees) December 2, 2023
Frustration was evident among many people, with another posting: "@Ryanair why have I now got to buy a seat to 
access a digital boarding pass that was free for years you're disgraceful and do nothing but congest airports and 
damage your reputation inexorably".
Speaking to The Mail on Sunday Ryanair spokesman said: "Passengers have the choice of choosing a seat for a 
small fee or be randomly allocated a seat free of charge."
The latest fee does not appear to affect all travellers, with some saying they got a digital boarding pass for free.

Body
Ryanair passengers say they are being charged an extra £21 if they want to get their online boarding passes -rather 
than queuing up to get them at the airport. Airport staff have told Mailonline and the BBC the change has been 
rolled out in the last few days.
The system means that you can check in online to get your boarding pass, but in order to print it you then have to 
pick a seat or request a random seat -which will cost you up to £21. To avoid the fee you instead have to queue up 
when you get to the airport to get your boarding pass -despite having checked in online.
Vivien Lovrin told the Mail she checked in but then had a message reading: "Check-in done! Get your boarding 
pass now and avoid queuing at the airport by adding a seat."
Securing a random seat costs £21. She said: "When you thought Ryanair couldn't sink any lower, they find a way to 
force you to buy a seat. How is this legal Isn't the whole point of online check-in to avoid people queuing at the 
airport"
Fabien Mauroy said on X: "Worse experience for people, long queue at airports, [and] polluting planet for money." 
Another passenger said: "When and why did you start this carry on I now have to QUEUE to collect my boarding 
pass at the airport"
Ryanair charges people £55 to print a boarding pass at the airport if you don't check in online.
 A Ryanair spokesman said: "Passengers have the choice of choosing a seat for a small fee or be randomly 
allocated a seat free of charge."

Body
The Prosecutor's Office of the Audiencia Nacional has requested that the company Ryanair be sentenced for 
violation of the right to strike of workers belonging to the collective of cabin crew in the stoppages called by USO 
and the Independent Union of Cabin Crew of Airline Passengers (Sitcpla) between June 2022 and January 2023.
This is stated in a note issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office, in which they also report in favor of the conviction 
of two other companies, subcontractors of the airline, for the same reasons: Crewlink Ireland LTD and 
Workforce International Contractors LTD.
The stoppages were the result of repeated claims for labor insecurity, and the Prosecutor's Office, after the trial 
held last November 29 in the Social Chamber of the AN, points out that it has been found that the airline 
"repeatedly and repeatedly carried out acts aimed at hindering and preventing the legitimate exercise of the right to 
strike through acts of various kinds".
Thus, it lists that there was "lack of information to the workers about the scheduled flights", there was an"abusive 
designation of the number of workers for the provision of minimum services", there was a "use of workers from 
third states" and there were warnings of disciplinary dismissals.
It should be recalled that the unions initiated the first legal actions after Ryanair breached, as they denounced, the 
Minimum Services Resolution issued by the Ministry of Transport on the first strike days scheduled for June 24, 
25 and 26 of that year. Ryanair included, they argued, as protected flights all those that were scheduled, resulting 
in an illegal setting of 100% of minimum services.
USO and Sitcpla pointed out that Ryanair crew members were forced to operate those flights under the guise of 
minimum services, so they could not effectively exercise their right to strike.
At the same time, USO and Sitcpla also filed a complaint with the Special Directorate of Labor Inspection and 
Social Security against Ryanair to bring to the attention of this body the "multiple irregularities" that, again, the 
airline would have committed "with total impunity", such as the allocation of guards, both at home and at home, 
which on that first day was 113% more than on any other Friday.
Prosecutor's Office asks Ryanair to be sentenced for violating the right to strike
The Supreme Court ruling
It so happens that in April of this same year, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Ryanair and its 
subcontractors Crewlink Ireland Ltd and Workforce Contractors Ltd against the judgment of the National Court of 
2021 which declared that these companies violated the right to strike of the workers who participated in the strike 
called on 10 days in September 2019, as well as the rights of freedom of association of USO and Sitcpla.
The judgment ratified by the Social Chamber of the Supreme Court declared the radical nullity of several of the 
corporate actions, as contrary to the fundamental rights to strike and freedom of association, and sentenced the 
defendant companies to compensate the two plaintiff unions for moral damages caused with the sum of 30,000 
euros for each of them.

Highlight: "I just can't believe your new policy," traveler James Harris wrote on social media.
Body
For low-cost airlines, the entire business model is  luring customers with a base fare for significantly lower than 
what is offered by other airlines and then  with extra fees for things that are also normally covered.
While someone traveling alone for a weekend in a nearby city with no bag can score a good deal, a very common 
complaint is that one  very much at all when fees for everything from baggage and seat selection to a bottle of water 
aboard the flight is factored in.
Over the weekend of Dec. 2 and 3, low-cost airline Ryanair  incurred much customer outrage after some travelers 
started reporting being asked to pay up to £21 ($26.53 USD) to download their boarding pass when checking in for 
their flights - the window that popped up after someone with the lowest ticket fare completes the check-in steps now 
reportedly reads "check-in done! get your boarding pass now and avoid queuing at the airport by adding a seat."
 Check-in pop-up causes a stir (but Ryanair denies making changes) 
Launched in 1985 out of Ireland, Ryanair rose to become the  by offering shuttle-style flights between nearby 
European cities for what in some cases could be as low as (EURO)19.99 ($21). The alternative for those who want 
to avoid the fee is, an airline spokesperson  the BBC, to come to the airport and line up for a physical check-in even 
if they have already checked in online.
More Travel:
"All Ryanair passengers can pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they 
can select a randomly allocated seat entirely free of charge," the spokesperson said while denying accusations that 
it added a fee.
A budget airline's fee is causing a storm of outrage
Both budget airlines and mainstream carriers charge economy travelers to select their seat ahead of check-in but, 
in Ryanair's model, those who do not pay extra only get their seat assigned at the airport instead of during online 
check-in like with full-service carriers.
'I just can't believe your new policy,' travelers complain 
Perhaps because more passengers started noticing the fee due to the new pop-up windows, it caused some 
serious discontent among travelers who feel that a boarding pass is a basic part of a plane ticket and should not be 
treated as an "extra" by the airline.
Ryanair has so far not been answering questions on which flights have the ticket fee (most of the customers seeing 
the new pop-ups have so far been in the United Kingdom) but the fee seen by different passengers ranged from £8 
for shorter flights and £21 for longer ones. 
"I just can't believe your new policy," traveler James Harris  on X, the social media platform formerly known as 
Twitter. "Ryanair added friction so you either now pay extra in time or money for something that is standard 
everywhere, i.e. a check in process to receive a ticket that gets you to the gate. I don't mind random seat allocation, 
but this newly added extra step is just wrong."

Ryanair passengers have hit out after claims the budget airline has added a new fee to charge for e-boarding 
passes.
Some said they have been charged up to £21 to obtain the pass - or alternatively, queue for a paper pass at the 
airport, according to the BBC.
The development was first reported by Mail Online after passengers took to social media to vent their frustration. It's 
not clear when the charge may have been introduced.
Ryanair has been asked for comment by the Belfast Telegraph.
One passenger contacted the airline on X, formerly known as Twitter. "When and why did you start this carry on? I 
now have to QUEUE to collect my boarding pass at the airport?" he asked.
Another said: "So what's this forcing people to buy seats after purchasing a flight or queue for a boarding pass all 
about? I thought the option to take a random seat was to avoid extra queues? Another cash gathering exercise?"
Airline passengers are commonly asked to check-in online and confirm their intention to take the flight, often 
downloading an electronic copy of their boarding pass at the same time. Passengers can also choose to pick up a 
paper copy at the airport but are not usually charged to do so.
Ryanair now appear to be asking some passengers to book a seat, which costs between £7 and £21 before they 
can download their boarding pass. If they do not book a seat, they have to queue for a pass at the airport.
Over the years budget airlines have added on charges for add-ons such as putting luggage in the hold, booking 
seats or choosing a seat with extra legroom. Companies often claim it's a measure to retain a low-price structure.

Ryanair passengers are being forced to pay £21 for a new hidden fee - or face huge airport queues. Until recently, 
the airline provided people with their digital boarding passes for free via their app.
But now passengers now have to pay between £7 and £21 for a randomly allocated seat, which will then allow them 
to have their pass on their phone before travelling to the airport. Those who don't pay up will have to wait in line to 
get their boarding pass at the check-in desks instead. 
"Charging for a mobile boarding pass You are ridiculous," fumed one user on Twitter/X in a tweet to the budget 
carrier. A second Ryanair passenger moaned: "I just can't believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to 
create a boarding pass mobile or print-out unless they buy a seat.
"Forcing them to join a check-in queue 30m or longer to do so for no other reason for you to make a few quid. 
Scandalous." A spokesperson from the budget carrier told Mail Online: "Passengers have the choice of choosing a 
seat for a small fee or be randomly allocated a seat free of charge."
Another raged: "If a passenger requires oxygen for medical reasons they are not allowed to bring their own and 
must pay 55 to use Ryanair's. WHAT !!!" Defending the carrier, one said: "If you don't like it don't use them. Last 
time we travelled overseas it actually worked out much cheaper and quicker to fly with a reputable airline when all 
the extras were taken into account."
Ryanair in hot water over new £21 charge and passengers say 'you are ridiculous'
Bambino agreed and said: "Have any of these negative commenting people flown regularly or flown ryan air If you 
holiday regularly via a third party then you don't get to choose the airline. I flew with on the beach and Ryan Air was 
already pre chosen. I flew to Crete with them in October. Got extra leg room, plane was fine, staff were polite. 
"Small hand luggage to fit under the seat as no overhead cabins which was fine for us. Only down side is you don't 
get any free food or drink or USB/C ports or tv's . But it wasn't a problem. They were fast to unload, turn around 
time and load the next lot on. No problems and efficient."

Ryanair cancelled 960 flights in November due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, it has been revealed.
In a report, the low-cost airline said it flew 11.7m passengers in November, a four per cent increase on the prior 
year and taking its 2023 total to 180.8m.
The number marks a significant dip on October’s figure of 17.1m. Load factor, the proportion of seats filled by 
passengers, sat at 92 per cent.
Airline shares dipped after Hamas invaded Israel last month, amid investor concern over route offerings and a spike 
in oil prices. The Irish carrier already cancelled over 870 flights in October due to the violence in the Middle East.
Ryanair has been one of the few major carriers to see shares continue rising in the quieter autumn months, 
following this summer’s record season of travel.
Budget rival Wizz Air reported a more measured fall in November’s passenger numbers this morning, carrying 4.8m 
passengers, down from 5.4m the priot month.
The Hungarian-based firm said it had decided to suspend operations in Israel until early January 2024, adding that 
it continues to “monitor the situation on the ground closely and stands ready to redeploy capacity should conditions 
stabilize.”
Chief executive József Váradi toldCity A.M. in early November that the war had created a “ripple effect” on demand 
across neighbouring countries in the region.

JUDGMENT
SUMMARY
Agency workers
The Employment Appeal Tribunal (“EAT”) dismissed Ryanair DAC ’ s and Storm Global Limited ’ s appeals from the 
decision of the London (East) Employment Tribunal (the “ET”) relating to the status of the claimant, Mr Lutz.
Mr Lutz was one of a pool of “contracted” pilots who flew Ryanair ’ s aircraft. He was supplied to Ryanair by MCG 
Aviation Limited (now Storm Global Limited). Mr Lutz brought claims: (i) against MCG alone for unpaid accrued 
annual leave pursuant to regulation 3 of the Civil Aviation (Working Time) Regulations 2004 SI 2004/ 756 (“CAWR”) 
on the basis that he was a “crew member” “employed” by MCG as a member of flight crew within the meaning of 
regulation 3; and/or within the parent Council Directive 2000/79/EC of 27 November 2000 concerning the European 
Agreement on the Organisation of Working Time of Mobile Workers in Civil Aviation; and/or a “worker” pursuant to 
Articles 31 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (the “EU Charter”); and (ii) against both MCG 
and Ryanair seeking the same employment conditions as would have applied if he had been directly recruited by 
Ryanair, pursuant to the Agency Worker Regulations 2010 SI 2010/93 (“AWR”) on the basis that he was an “agency 
worker” within the meaning of regulation 3(1).
Following a preliminary hearing the ET accepted that Mr Lutz had the alleged statuses. It was common ground that 
he had a contract with MCG and that he was “supplied” to Ryanair to work as a pilot under its direction within the 
meaning of regulation 3(1)(a), AWR. Unchallenged findings made by the ET included: that Mr Lutz was not in 
business in his own account and Ryanair and MCG were not his clients; that there was a complete imbalance of 
power and Mr Lutz was not able to alter anything about the arrangements; that the service company he was 
required to use was a fiction; that the substitution clause in the written agreement was a sham; and that the 
dominant purpose of the arrangement was for Mr Lutz to provide personal service as pilot to Ryanair.
United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal Decision: Ryanair DAC & Anor v Lutz [2023] EAT 146 (30 
November 2023)
As regards the CAWR claim, the parties accepted that “employed” was to be understood in the EU law sense of an 
“employment relationship”. In Allonby v Accrington and Rossendale College [2004] ICR 1328, the Court of Justice 
of the European Communities had accepted that a tripartite arrangement involving an individual who was supplied 
by an agency to provide services to and under the direction of an end user, could give rise to a worker relationship 
between the individual and the agency. The EAT held that Lord Leggatt JSC ’ s analysis in Uber BV v Aslam [2021] 
UKSC 5, [2021] ICR 657 (“Uber”) had not narrowed that position and that the ET ’ s findings were sufficient to 
support the conclusion that Mr Lutz was employed by MCG for the purposes of CAWR.
As regards the AWR claims, the EAT found that the ET was entitled to conclude that Mr Lutz ’ s contract was to 
perform work or services personally within the meaning of regulation 3(1)(b)(ii) AWR and no material error of law 
was disclosed by its reasoning. In so far as a right to substitute existed, the ET was correct in taking into account 
fetters arising from airline safety regulatory requirements; there was no distinction of principle between these 
circumstances and the regulatory requirements in Uber and in Sejpal v Rodericks Dental Ltd [2022] EAT 91, [2022] 
ICR 1339.
The EAT also determined that the ET had not erred in concluding that the supply of Mr Lutz pursuant to a five year 
fixed term was to work “temporarily” within the meaning of regulation 3(1)(a) AWR. There was no basis for 
departing from the earlier EAT authorities that had considered the meaning of this concept (Moran v Ideal Cleaning 
Services Ltd [2014] ICR 442; Brooknight Guarding Limited v Matei (EAT/0309/17/LA); and Angard Staffing 
Solutions Ltd v Kocur [2020] ICR 1541), which, in any event, were correctly decided. Accordingly, the ET was 
correct in deciding that the supply of Mr Lutz was terminable on a condition being satisfied, rather than an open-
ended indefinite arrangement and, as such, was temporary. In this instance, the ET ’ s findings of fact indicated that 
the agreed five year term represented the basis of the supply in practice; and the nature of any successive 
assignment was to be considered at the point of that supply.
MRS JUSTICE HEATHER WILLIAMS:
Introduction
1.This is the unanimous judgment of all three members of the appeal tribunal, to which the lay members have made 
a valuable contribution.
2.Ryanair DAC and Storm Global Limited both appeal the decision of the London (East) Employment Tribunal (“the 
ET”), Employment Judge Housego (“the EJ”) sent to the parties on 5 April 2022 following a preliminary hearing to 
determine the status of the claimant, Mr Lutz.
3.Mr Lutz was one of a pool of “contracted pilots” who flew Ryanair ’ s aircraft. The EJ indicated that there were 
many pilots in the same position as him (paragraph 1, ET ’ s Reasons). Mr Lutz was supplied to Ryanair by a 
company known as MCG Aviation Limited. That company is now called Storm Global Limited. To avoid any 
confusion, in this judgment we will refer to the parties as follows: “Ryanair”, “MCG” and Mr Lutz. This corresponds 
to the way they are referred to in the ET ’ s decision.
4.Mr Lutz has brought two claims:
i) Against MCG alone for unpaid accrued annual leave pursuant to regulation 3 of the Civil Aviation (Working Time) 
Regulations 2004 SI 2004/ 756 (“CAWR”) on the basis that he was a “crew member” within the meaning of 
regulation 3; and/or under the parent Council Directive 2000/79/EC of 27 November 2000 concerning the European 
Agreement on the Organisation of Working Time of Mobile Workers in Civil Aviation (the “AVD” and the “Aviation 
Agreement” respectively); and/or pursuant to Articles 31 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU 
(the “EU Charter”);
ii)Against both MCG and Ryanair for the same working and employment conditions as would have applied if he had 
been directly recruited by Ryanair, particularly in relation to pay and/or annual leave, pursuant to the Agency 
United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal Decision: Ryanair DAC & Anor v Lutz [2023] EAT 146 (30 
November 2023)
Worker Regulations 2010 SI 2010/93 (“AWR”) on the basis that he was an “agency worker” within the meaning of 
regulation 3(1).
5.As set out in the ET ’ s Judgment, the EJ determined:
i)Mr Lutz was a “crew member” employed by MCG within the meaning of regulation 3, CAWR;
ii)Mr Lutz was a “crew member” on board civil aircraft employed by MCG within the meaning of the Aviation 
Agreement;
iii)Mr Lutz was a “worker” for the purposes of Article 31 of the EU Charter;
iv)Mr Lutz was an “agency worker” within the meaning of regulation 3(1) AWR, as he was supplied by MCG to work 
temporarily for and under the supervision and direction of Ryanair and he had a contract with MCG to perform work 
or services personally;
v)Mr Lutz was not excluded from this definition of “agency worker” by regulation 3(2) AWR as he did not carry on a 
profession or business in which either MCG or Ryanair was a client or customer within the meaning of that 
regulation.
6.Ryanair appeal against the fourth of these conclusions, taking issue with the findings that Mr Lutz was supplied to 
work “temporarily” (Grounds 1 and 2 of their grounds of appeal) and that his contract with MCG was to perform 
work or services personally (Grounds 3 - 5).
7.In their original grounds of appeal, MCG also appealed against the finding that Mr Lutz was supplied to Ryanair to 
work “temporarily” (Ground 3); the ET ’ s failure to find that the regulation 4(2) AWR exception applied, so that it 
was not a “temporary work agency” (Ground 2); and the finding that he was employed by MCG as a “crew member” 
for the purposes of CAWR (Ground 1). MCG did not appeal the conclusion that Mr Lutz was a worker for the 
purposes of the EU Charter, nor the finding that he had a contract with MCG to perform work and services 
personally within the meaning of regulation 3(1)(b) AWR. During the hearing, after the latter was raised in the 
course of oral submissions, MCG sought permission to amend its grounds of appeal to include a challenge to the 
finding that Mr Lutz ’ s contract with MCG was to perform work or services personally (“the amendment 
application”). There was no challenge to the ET ’ s finding that Mr Lutz did not carry out a profession or business in 
which MCG and/or Ryanair was a client or customer.
8.Draft amended grounds of appeal were supplied by Mr Brown KC at the start of Day 2 of the hearing. The other 
parties raised no objection to the amendment application. As it relied upon the same arguments as those already 
raised in respect of MCG ’ s Crew Member Ground, we accept that no prejudice would be occasioned to Mr Lutz by 
the grant of the amendment. We heard the substantive submission on a provisional basis, indicating that we would 
address the amendment application in our reserved decision. Given the circumstances, we grant MCG permission 
to amend their grounds of appeal in the terms sought.
9.At this stage we will briefly identify each of the grounds of appeal, in order to give an indication of the issues that 
we need to decide. (For further detail see paragraphs 121 - 130 below.) We begin with the one ground relating to 
the CAWR claim and then set out the AWR grounds (in the order in which we will consider these grounds in due 
course):
i)The ET erred in finding that Mr Lutz was a “crew member” who was “employed by” MCG. Although there was a 
contract between Mr Lutz and MCG, the ET failed to address the nature of the contract and specifically whether 
there was a sufficient contractual nexus between these parties, particularly given it was a tripartite contract with Mr 
Lutz ’ s service company. Furthermore, the ET erred in finding that the relationship was “employment” in the EU law 
sense identified in Allonby v Accrington and Rossendale College [2004] ICR 1328 (“Allonby”) and Uber BV v Aslam 
[2021] UKSC 5, [2021] ICR 657 (“Uber”) (“MCG ’ s Crew Member Ground”);
United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal Decision: Ryanair DAC & Anor v Lutz [2023] EAT 146 (30 
November 2023)
ii)The ET erred in failing to conclude that MCG was not a “temporary work agency” for the purposes of the AWR as 
a result of the exception in regulation 4(2) (“MCG ’ s TWA Ground”);
iii)The ET misdirected itself, misapplied the law and/or arrived at a perverse conclusion in finding that Mr Lutz had 
no right of substitution and/or that, if there was a right of substitution, it did not negative the conclusion that his 
contract with MCG was to “perform work or services personally” within the meaning of regulation 3(1)(b)(ii) AWR 
(“Ryanair ’ s Substitution Grounds”);
iv)Mr Lutz was not an “agency worker” within the meaning of regulation 3(1)(b)(ii) AWR for the same reasons as 
those relied upon under MCG ’ s Crew Member Ground (“MCG ’ s Additional Ground”);
v)The ET misdirected itself in law and/or misapplied the law in concluding that Mr Lutz was “temporarily” supplied to 
Ryanair within the meaning of regulation 3(1)(a) AWR, in particular in circumstances where the ET found that on the 
expiry of the five years fixed term, contracted pilots were always issued with a new five year contract; and these 
pilots did not provide cover, but were rostered on the same basis as Ryanair ’ s permanently employed pilots. 
Alternatively, the existing case law on the meaning of “temporarily” in this provision (Moran v Ideal Cleaning 
Services Ltd [2014] ICR 442 (“Moran”); Brooknight Guarding Limited v Matei (EAT/0309/17/LA) (“Brooknight”); and 
Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd v Kocur [2020] ICR 1541 (“Angard”)) fails to properly interpret the meaning of 
“temporarily” (“Ryanair ’ s Temporarily Grounds”); and
vi)The ET erred in finding that Mr Lutz was “temporarily” supplied to Ryanair within the meaning of regulation 
3(1)(a) AWR, and in particular the ET erred in finding that the five year contract between Mr Lutz and MCG was 
determinative of the nature of the supply arrangements between MCG and Ryanair (“MCG ’ s Temporarily 
Ground”).
10.Mr Lutz resists the appeal and relies upon the ET ’ s Reasons and also upon his additional grounds for resisting 
the appeal dated 3 February 2023.
11.By order sealed on 21 December 2022 the appeal was set down for a full hearing by HHJ Martyn Barklem, with 
a time estimate of two days. We are grateful to all counsel for their very clear and helpful written and oral 
submissions, which were of considerable assistance to us.
12.The structure of this judgment is as follows:
(i)The ET ’ s decision: paragraphs 13 - 63;
(ii)The legal framework: paragraphs 64 - 120;
(iii)The grounds of appeal: paragraphs 121 - 130;
(iv)General observations: paragraphs 131- 134;
(v)MCG ’ s Crew Member Ground and Additional Ground: paragraphs 135 - 159;
(vi)MCG ’ s TWA Ground: paragraphs 160 - 163;
(vii)Ryanair ’ s Substitution Grounds: Ground 3: paragraphs 164 - 169;
(viii)Ryanair ’ s Substitution Grounds: Grounds 4 and 5: paragraphs 170 - 191;
(ix)Ryanair ’ s and MCG ’ s Temporarily Grounds: paragraphs 192 - 212;
(x)Outcome: paragraph 213.
The ET ’ s decision
United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal Decision: Ryanair DAC & Anor v Lutz [2023] EAT 146 (30 
November 2023)
13.There was an agreed list of issues before the EJ. Paragraphs 1 - 5 concerned the status issues that were to be 
determined at the preliminary hearing. The hearing took place over four days, 29 March - 1 April 2022 and the 
reserved judgment was promulgated very shortly afterwards on 5 April 2022. As described in paragraph 5 of the 
Reasons, the ET heard oral evidence from the claimant and from his witness, Ben Morais, a Ryanair captain and 
Chairman of the Company Council for the British Airline Pilots Association. The ET also heard from Diarmiud 
Rogers, Head of Flight Operations Base Management, and Grace Crawford, Base Manager, on behalf of Ryanair; 
and from Robert Scanlon of Scanlon Associates Ltd (“Scanlons”) and Elizabeth Hoefsmit, Managing Director of 
MCG, on behalf of MCG.
Findings of fact
14.As we return to below, the structure of the ET ’ s Reasons is not easy to follow at times. In addition, the findings 
of fact do not always appear chronologically. For present purposes we have set out the EJ ’ s factual findings in a 
broadly chronological order. After setting out these findings, we turn to the EJ ’ s reasoning and conclusions. We 
leave some key findings of fact, as opposed to narrative, to that subsequent section.
15.Ryanair had a five-year agreement with MCG (then called Storm McGinley Support Services Ltd) dated 28 
December 2011. Although the agreement was expressed to be for a term of five years, the parties continued to 
operate under it at all material times thereafter. MCG was referred to therein as “the Supplier” to Ryanair. The 
written agreement said that MCG agreed to procure Service Companies for Ryanair, who would have “Company 
Representatives”, who would constitute a pool of pilots that MCG would provide to support seasonal fluctuations in 
Ryanair ’ s level of need for pilots (paragraph 27). The EJ observed that the arrangement was initially envisaged to 
provide a series of temporary assignments with gaps in between, but by the time that Mr Lutz became involved, the 
rostering of all pilots, contracted and employed, was done on the same basis (paragraph 27). In due course, 
“contracted pilots became even more integrated when Ryanair agreed that for seniority purposes all pilots were in 
one pool” (paragraph 27, ET ’ s Reasons).
16.On 10 August 2017, Mr Lutz applied to Ryanair in response to an advertisement for pilots (paragraphs 28 and 
29, ET ’ s Reasons). He passed a preliminary assessment in September 2017 (paragraphs 28, 29 and 30). Mr Lutz 
’ s first contact with MCG was when Mr Loadwick of MCG emailed him to inform him that he had passed the 
assessment and that he was to be offered a place as a contracted pilot (paragraphs 32 - 34). In due course Mr Lutz 
was notified of the training course he was expected to attend. The training was to fly a particular type of aircraft; in 
Mr Lutz ’ s case, a Boeing 737. This was decided by Ryanair and he had no say in the matter (paragraphs 36 - 37). 
As a contracted pilot he had to pay for the training (paragraph 37).
17.A subsequent email from Mr Loadwick sent on 2 October 2017 informed Mr Lutz that he needed to set up an 
Irish limited company. He was given the names of three accountancy firms who could do this for him and who would 
then manage things. He was told to pick one of the three and he picked ContractingPlus Ltd (paragraph 39). 
ContractingPlus set Mr Lutz up with a limited company, Sudeley Ltd (paragraph 40) and arranged for him to sign an 
agreement dated 19 October 2017, which was expressed to be made between MCG (described as “ the Contractor 
”), Sudeley and Mr Lutz, (described as “the Company Representative”) (paragraph 51).

Alliance News) - Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Monday both said passenger 
traffic increased in November compared to a year before, despite flight cancellations to Israel amid the ongoing 
conflict. 
Dublin-based Ryanair said that it carried 11.7 million passengers in November 2023, up 4% from 11.2 million in the 
corresponding month last year. Its load factor was unmoved at 92%. 
On a rolling 12-month basis to October, Ryanair said it carried 180.8 million passengers, up 14% from 158.4 million 
the year before. The load factor improved to 94% from 91%.
Ryanair added that it operated over 66,400 flights in November, but noted that over 960 flights were cancelled due 
to the Israel/Gaza conflict.
Meanwhile, Budapest-based Wizz Air said it carried 4.8 million passengers in November, up 29% from 3.7 million 
the year prior.  Capacity for the month was also 29% higher at 5.4 million seats.
Its load factor improved year-on-year to 88.4% from 88.1%. 
Wizz Air's carbon dioxide emissions in November grew 32% to 452,743 tonnes from 343,874 last year.
The Hungarian airline said that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until early January, adding that it 
continues to monitor the situation and "stands ready to redeploy capacity should conditions stabilise."
Shares in Wizz Air were trading 1.1% lower at 1,926.00 pence each in London on Monday morning, while Ryanair 
shares were up 0.4% at EUR18.07 in Dublin.

Highlight: Everyone from Samsung to Victoria’s Secret is getting in on Roblox. We hunted down the very worst 
branded experiences in the all-ages game platform (and an unofficial Ryanair world)
Body
Gone are the days where a billboard at the side of the road and an expensive TV advert during the X Factor were 
enough to get your product noticed. Now you’ve got to advertise in online video games, such as Roblox. If you 
haven’t heard of Roblox, it’s basically a more rubbish version of Minecraft. Instead of creating worlds, people – 
mostly children – create complete games. Then, they can upload and potentially monetise them.
Roblox now houses more than 50m games that can be played on your phone, computer or games console, and 
19% of all children in the UK are said to play it. It has had its success stories, turning the occasional teenager into a 
millionaire from their bedroom, but it also has a dark side, with children running up bills in the thousands buying 
pixelated meta-tat and, worse, receiving allegations of games being used for grooming.  But none of that has 
stopped corporations getting involved with their own branded Roblox worlds. Who wouldn’t want to virtually recreate 
the thrills and spills of checking in to a budget airline flight, or learn how frozen chips are made? We trawled our 
way through the worst Roblox corporate tie-ins and an unofficial Ryanair world, so you don’t have to.
McCain Farms of the Future
If you’ve ever wondered how chips are made (spoiler: grow some potatoes, cut them into chips, bam), then Farms 
of the Future is for you. I learned, begrudgingly, about the future of the potato, which alas is not a super-engineered 
sentient being like Super Potato in Peppa Pig, but instead … regeneratively farmed potatoes. Even more 
disappointingly, the farms of the future don’t feature flying tractors or cows standing on their hind legs wearing 
cardigans. Instead you’ll be learning all about soil health, biodiversity and on-farm resilience to climate change as 
you chip your own ’tatoes, serve them from a van, then build your own farm to grow even more regenerative spuds. 
All of this is about as interesting as a boiled potato. 2/5
Who wants to farm potatoes in the metaverse? Exploring Roblox ’s corporate hell-worlds
L’Oréal Paris Hair Colour
Apparently, by accepting the L’Oréal Paris Hair Colour Challenge, I can win some hair. It’s been a long time since 
I’ve had hair, so I’m certainly – desperately – up for the challenge. Like McCain Farms of the Future, L’Oréal Paris 
Hair Colour is part of Livetopia – a giant, ever evolving Roblox metaverse, rather than a standalone game. It plays 
more like a branded interlude, a quick five minute job while you’re wandering around looking for something less 
boring to do instead.
All I have to do is choose the right hair colour for my three customers – Alix, Eve and Sam. Alix, Eve and Sam are 
particularly fussy about their barnets, so it’s a case of trial and error. But I soon have them smiling (at least, I would, 
if they had faces) and the hair prize is mine. I feel like that bit in the Simpsons when Homer discovers Dimoxinil  
and runs through the streets to celebrate. 2/5
Samsung Space Tycoon
Disappointingly, downloading Samsung Space Tycoon on an iPhone doesn’t cause it to instantly explode – a trick 
surely missed here by one of Apple’s main competitors. Space Tycoon certainly seems more interesting than a visit 
to the Apple Store. You run around a space station, mining the raw materials such as copper and cobalt to turn into 
Samsung products like Galaxy Watches and Z Flip phones. You then sell these to make funds available to hire an 
alien workforce to assemble future Samsung products such as hoverboards, pogo sticks, and Z Flip backpacks. 
There are plenty of little sub games to relieve you of the slightly repetitive gameplay of: mine this, make that, sell 
this, make that. There’s no arguing the whole thing is Samsunged to the max, but it’s easily the best of the lot so 
far. So have an extra Samsung-branded star for that. 3/5
Victoria’s Secret Happy Nation
Before you call the police or lose it on Mumsnet, there is a valid reason that Victoria’s Secret – you know, the frilly 
underwear people – have entered a metaverse aimed at kids. They’ve now launched their own range of “size-
inclusive and gender-free products” such as sweats, swimwear, bras, undies and body care, aimed at tweens, all 
under the Happy Nation brand. This is to, and I quote: “Help foster a judgment-free community that is supportive 
and accepting of tweens during some of the most transformative years of their lives.” All we got in my day was a 
hand-me-down Gillette razor and a box of Oxy pads.
I read that the Happy Nation Roblox game has you running around a happy shopping centre, going down slides, 
customising shirts, and playing “obby” (obstacle) games to win virtual money to spend. It’s part of the BayView 
metaverse – again, a giant Roblox mall that constantly evolves. I go in search of it, but after an hour of fruitless 
running about, turns out that Happy Nation has now left the BayView metaverse, so neither you, nor I, can actually 
play it any more. Oh well. 1/5
Unofficial Ryanair
Hats off to 19-year-old Aberdeen computer science student Sebastian Codling, who coded the unofficial Ryanair 
Roblox world when he was just 11. Since 2015, Codling has helped simulate more than a million Ryainair flights 
with all the thrills, spills, frustration and wanting to jump out of the airplane window of the real thing. Speaking to the 
Times this October, Codling explained how he now employs full-time staff to cope with the demand from more than 
80,000 members.
Unlike the majority of Roblox games, you can’t just download and play. Instead, you have to book an “actual” ticket. 
There are more flights in the evenings, after school. I’m booked in on the 19:45 from Kraków. Value tickets are free, 
Flexi Plus cost 620 Robux or £5.50 in real money. (Roblox takes a cut of all its game creators’ profits, which 
explains why the company has just been valued at £19bn.)
Once you’ve checked in to the (virtual) airport at a real time, the experience couldn’t be closer to the real thing. It’s 
got overpriced food, overcrowded check-in lanes and charges for any luggage that weighs more than a slice of 
cucumber. The amazing thing is that all the people you see and engage with are also real people playing on 
Who wants to farm potatoes in the metaverse? Exploring Roblox ’s corporate hell-worlds
Roblox, from the other passengers to the staff to the pilot. You can even apply to work at Roblox Ryanair. There are 
83 people on my flight, but I’m chucked off because I wanted to see what would happen if I told the person at the 
check-in desk that I had a bomb in my suitcase, and I was taken away to be officially bollocked by security. At least, 
here in cyberspace, you can’t be charged to go to the toilet. 5/5

Ryanair reveals 960 flights axed in November due to Gaza conflict

Low-cost airline Ryanair has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel 
and Hamas.
It comes after the Irish carrier cancelled over 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in Gaza.
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7 and due to the subsequent escalation of the war.
Rival easyJet said last week that conflict and the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected demand 
for flights in destinations such as Egypt, while it saw bookings impacted across the board in October and November 
due to the war.
EasyJet warned that it does not expect to narrow losses in the first quarter of its new financial year as flights and 
wider demand are affected, but it said booking appetite had started to recover in recent weeks.
Ryanair’s latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4% increase in 
people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said on Monday that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until 
early January next year.
The budget airline said it “continues to monitor the situation on the ground closely, and stands ready to redeploy 
capacity should conditions stabilise”. 
It carried 29.3% more passengers in November, at 4.8 million.
Wizz Air said it had also restarted inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova, in Eastern Europe having suspended flights 
to the country in March due to tensions linked to Russia’s war with Ukraine.

It said the move follows a “comprehensive evaluation of safety factors”, adding that the group “intends to gradually 
reintroduce operations, including reopening its base in Chisinau, while ensuring safe and secure operations for its 
crew and passengers”.

Highlight: Airlines have been forced to suspend flights to Tel Aviv and Jordan after Hamas militants launched an 
attack on Israel on October 7.
Body
Low-cost airline Ryanair  has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel  
and Hamas. 
It comes after the Irish carrier cancelled over 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in Gaza. 
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv  and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7 and due to the subsequent escalation of the war.
Rival easyJet said last week that conflict and the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected demand 
for flights in destinations such as Egypt, while it saw bookings impacted across the board in October and November 
due to the war.
EasyJet warned that it does not expect to narrow losses in the first quarter of its new financial year as flights and 
wider demand are affected, but it said booking appetite had started to recover in recent weeks.
Ryanair’s latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4% increase in 
people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said on Monday that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until 
early January next year.
The budget airline said it “continues to monitor the situation on the ground closely, and stands ready to redeploy 
capacity should conditions stabilise”. â€‹
It carried 29.3% more passengers in November, at 4.8 million.

Wizz Air said it had also restarted inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova, in Eastern Europe having suspended flights 
to the country in March due to tensions linked to Russia’s war with Ukraine.
It said the move follows a “comprehensive evaluation of safety factors”, adding that the group “intends to gradually 
reintroduce operations, including reopening its base in Chisinau, while ensuring safe and secure operations for its 
crew and passengers”.

An English couple living in Fulham had planned to go to Marseille, France, to watch a soccer match. The return, 
naturally, was to their hometown in the UK. But something went wrong for Elise Mallia, 33, and Jessy Jezequel, 41. 
The Ryanair plane that was supposed to take them home landed 1,300 kilometers away and in another country: 
Spain.
 The couple had taken advantage of the tour to take a short tour of the port city before going to the airport: their 
boarding ticket went through three controls before entering the boarding gate, but they still ended up 
unexpectedly extending their trip with a trip to the Spanish capital, according to the Mirror.
 It wasn't until the couple descended into Madrid that they both realized the mix-up. Elise, who works as a Fulham 
estate agent, said, "About an hour into our flight, Jesse said he thought he heard a flight attendant say Madrid, 
but we thought he had dreamt it."
He continued, "But after that we started to realize that all the flight attendants spoke Spanish. When we asked, they 
told us we were going to Madrid, and we had no idea how it was possible to be on that flight and not the flight that 
was taking us home."
They took a plane and showed up anywhere.
The woman further recounted that they had scanned their boarding passes three times before boarding the flight 
and assumed they must have been wrong, but when they checked, they were not. They were approaching Madrid. 
"We were baffled and so were the flight attendants," he said.
"We panicked."
"We got home in the end, but we still have no idea how it happened. It's not like taking the wrong bus, we literally 
ended up in a different country!" she exclaimed.
 The story went viral in April, when the couple had booked a flight from Marseille to Stansted Airport and were 
heading towards what they believed was the correct boarding gate. Elise said she swore she saw 'Madrid' at the 
gate next to theirs.
 She recalled that she even made a joke to Jesse that they should continue their vacation and go to Spain instead 
of returning to London, not realizing that they would be fulfilling that idea, but not at the right time.
They board a plane to return home but get off anywhere: "We showed up in another country".
 Elise said, "Surely it must be quite difficult to get on the wrong plane because of security!". The couple eventually 
made it back to Fulham, but five hours later than planned. "We were in a panic and tried to explain to the staff that 
we weren't supposed to be in Spain."
The couple never cease to be amazed by the failures at the checks_ "Everyone thought we were mad at first, until 
we showed them our boarding passes. How did no one notice our boarding passes or that there were two other 
passengers on the flight?
 "Surely you shouldn't be able to get on the wrong plane without anyone noticing!".
A Ryanair spokesman gave details of what the company believes happened: "Mr. Jezequel and Ms. Mallia boarded 
their flight from Marseille to London Stansted through the correct gate. However, these passengers did not follow 
the route assigned to the aircraft departing for London Stansted, crossed an unauthorized area and mistakenly 
boarded a flight bound for Madrid."
And it detailed, "As for the couple occupying the same seats assigned on their original flight, they explained, "Both 
passengers were able to occupy the same seats they had booked for their original flight, as this flight was not fully 
booked, so they were not alerted to their error at this time."
"Prior to the departure of each flight, an announcement is made informing passengers of their final destination and 
estimated time of arrival, which should have alerted Mr. Jezequel and Ms. Mallia that they were on the wrong 
plane," they explained.
"Upon arrival at Madrid airport, these passengers realized their mistake and Ryanair personnel were notified of 
these diverted passengers. Mr. Jezequel and Ms. Mallia were accommodated on a flight from Madrid to London 
Stansted that same day.
The company placed the responsibility on them to board the correct flight:"It is the responsibility of each 
passenger to ensure that they board the correct aircraft".

Should I buy my brother a Ryanair Christmas voucher?

Highlight: TRAVEL QUESTIONS: Simon Calder on festive gift cards, packing Christmas presents, and travelling to 
Colombia
Body
Q I have just received an email headed: “Make your Christmas shopping stress-free.” I’m all in favour of that. The 
invitation is from Ryanair and urges me to “gift your loved ones a Ryanair gift card”. My brother has a house near 
Pisa in Italy and regularly flies there on Ryanair. Should I be tempted to send him £100 worth of flights?
                     Sarah A                   
                     A This is a question I tend to get each December, and my answer remains the same: no. I welcome 
the general trend towards giving experiences rather than goods. What better, you might wonder, than the gift of 
travel? But if you buy a gift card for a particular airline, you risk providing a distinctly inferior experience.
Airlines love selling vouchers. They take in cash in exchange for a future obligation to offer air travel to the same 
value; Ryanair even asks the donor to pay an extra £2 on top for administration. Some people will forget to use their 
present by the expiry date (a year after issue in the case of Ryanair), which then gifts the carrier some useful free 
money. Some travel gift vouchers, but not Ryanair’s, insist the voucher is used in one go; your brother would not 
need to use the full £100 in a single transaction, and any balance is carried forward to use within the year.
Yet even if your brother is assiduous about using the voucher, it is not a helpful asset. Ryanair has a good range of 
flights to Pisa, from Birmingham, East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted, Manchester and Prestwick. But it has 
no monopoly from the UK: easyJet flies from London Gatwick and Manchester, while British Airways departs from 
London Heathrow. If a rival airline has a more convenient departure airport, timing or fare, you will inadvertently 
prevent him from the ideal itinerary.
May I offer an alternative? Credit his bank account with £102 (which is what a £100 Ryanair gift card would have 
cost you), and give him a card explaining that you would like to buy him some flying. You might even want to print 
Should I buy my brother a Ryanair Christmas voucher?
out my response to you, to show him what you were thinking. And thank you for the opportunity to remind people to 
steer clear of travel company-specific gift vouchers this Christmas.
                     Q I am visiting relatives in Kentucky for Christmas, flying via Atlanta. I am taking presents in my 
checked-in luggage. I hope to be flying back with some, too. I have heard that security staff can break into your 
baggage if necessary, though I also heard you can get special locks that they can open. Can you advise?
                     Josie H                   
                     A In the US, all airport security is handled by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). One of 
its many requirements is that all connecting baggage from passengers arriving from overseas must be rechecked 
before an onward domestic flight. You will need to pick up your checked-in luggage from the carousel on arrival, 
take it through customs and drop it off again at the airline check-in. At this stage, your baggage becomes of interest 
to TSA screeners.
The TSA says: “The majority of checked baggage is screened without the need for a physical bag search.” But 
yours might be pulled for a hand search – especially if it contains items such as tightly packed books, which are 
difficult to identify on scanners. I don’t use locks on checked luggage, because I find them more trouble than they 
are worth, but many people like to deploy them. If you prefer to lock the baggage, it’s easy to buy so-called “TSA-
compliant” locks, including in the UK. These are typically combination locks that you can set yourself. What makes 
them useful is that the manufacturer has provided a master key to the TSA so that they can be unlocked without 
damage.
That, at least, is the theory. The TSA says it “has no position on the validity or effectiveness of these products as a 
security measure and will be forced to remove these products if necessary during the inspection”. The odds, 
though, are in your favour.
On your return journey, you can check the baggage right through from the local airport in Kentucky to your final 
destination; the TSA regards screening done at one location to be valid at other US airports on the bag’s itinerary.
                     Q I have booked flights to Colombia at the end of February for 18 days. I have nothing else booked 
yet, but I am planning to visit Bogota, Medellin and Cartagena – possibly including the Rosario Islands. Any other 
suggestions?
                     Pat W                   
                     A What a joy to be able to look forward to a trip to Colombia in the northern winter. It is South 
America’s most generous nation, in terms of the breadth of experiences on offer: Caribbean beaches, Andean 
peaks, Hispanic history and Amazonian adventures.
With just 18 days to make the most of the country, I suggest you start lining up some domestic flights; while the 
terrestrial scenery is impressive, the highways are very dangerous and I always fly rather than travel very long 
distances by road. Bogota to Cartagena is over 400 miles by air, and a lot more by rail.
Assuming you are flying to Bogota airport, get a plane straight out as soon as you arrive: the capital is certainly 
interesting, but best appreciated when you are more in tune with Colombian life. Head for Cartagena, the most 
enchanting Spanish city in South America. After a day or two of immersion in its colonial grandeur, you should 
certainly head over by boat to the Rosario Islands. If you are a beach person, stay overnight in one of the laid-back 
resorts, otherwise make it a day trip.
You could go overland to Medellin (opt for the highest quality bus you can afford). This high-altitude, high-energy 
metropolis is in the middle of some superb landscapes. Cali, further south, is also superb for music and cuisine. For 
more colonial ambience head south to Popayan and possibly Pasto, close to the Ecuadorean border.
Finally, fly back to Bogota. You will enjoy your time here more with some street smartness. Stay in the once-
neglected but now restored Barrio La Candelaria, its charming historic heart.
Should I buy my brother a Ryanair Christmas voucher?

Highlight: Airlines have been forced to suspend flights to Tel Aviv and Jordan after Hamas militants launched an 
attack on Israel on October 7th
Body
Low-cost airline Ryanair has said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to the war between Israel 
and Hamas.
It comes after the Dublin-based carrier cancelled over 870 flights in October as a result of the conflict in 
Gaza.Advertisement
Airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv and neighbouring Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7th and due to the subsequent escalation of the war.
British rival easyJet said last week that conflict and the threat to stability across the Middle East has also affected 
demand for flights in destinations such as Egypt, while it saw bookings impacted across the board in October and 
November due to the war.

EasyJet warned that it does not expect to narrow losses in the first quarter of its new financial year as flights and 
wider demand are affected, but it said booking appetite had started to recover in recent weeks.
AdvertisementRyanair's latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4 per 
cent increase in people flown, at 11.7 million, despite the cancellations.
London-listed Hungarian airline Wizz Air said on Monday that it has decided to suspend operations in Israel until 
early January next year.

capacity should conditions stabilise". â€‹Advertisement
It carried 29.3 per cent more passengers in November, at 4.8 million.
Wizz Air said it had also restarted inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova, in Eastern Europe having suspended flights 
to the country in March due to tensions linked to Russia's war with Ukraine.
It said the move follows a "comprehensive evaluation of safety factors", adding that the group "intends to gradually

The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree looked like half of it was missing when it was first installed 
The famous Trafalgar Square Christmas tree has been lifted into place this morning after its long journey from 
Norway and, not for the first time, questions were immediately asked about why it looked like half of it was missing. 
The massive 62ft Norwegian spruce had travelled all the way from the forests north of Oslo and as it was 
manoeuvred into place looked like it was feeling the effects of the long journey, having been felled on November 24.
As London's showpiece festive tree was lowered into its stand wags on social media were quick to mock its 
appearance with a host of branches appearing to be missing. One social media user, Rachel Ramsay, took to X, 
formerly Twitter, to ask: "Where is the other half of it?!"
Another, Suganthan Mohanadasan, joked: "That's only half the tree. Explains the recession in Norway." "Is it me, or 
does it look quite dead?" @glitter_JoJo asked.
The 70-year-old tree as it was felled in Norway 
However, others rushed to defend the tree, with Dan Barker commenting: "It'll perk up - it's had a long journey!" And 
indeed within a few hours the tree was starting to look more like it had before being placed on its side for the long 
trip across the North Sea.
This year's tree was grown in Nordmarka, 19 miles north of Oslo. Norway sends a tree to London every year as a 
token of thanks for Britain's support during World War Two. This year marks the 76th anniversary since King 
Haakon VII sent the first spruce to London.
When Norway was invaded in 1940, the King of Norway sought refuge in Britain and the Norwegian government-in-
exile was established in London.
'Where's the other half?' Sad-looking Trafalgar Square Christmas tree brutally mocked
The tree arrived at the Port of Immingham after crossing from Norway by boat where it underwent checks before 
being driven to London on Saturday.
Within a few hours the tree began to look a little more like itself again 
This year's tree will be decorated in traditional Norwegian fashion with vertical strings of energy-efficient lights, with 
the lights being switched on this Thursday.
The Lord Mayor of Westminster Patricia McAllister joined the British Ambassador Jan Thompson for the official 
felling ceremony in Norway where the tree appeared much bushier than when it arrived in London.
It isn't the first time that the tree has been ridiculued for being in a bit of a sorry state.

Last year the tree was mocked as "limp" and "scrawny", while the 2021 tree was cruelly labelled as "flea bitten" due 
to its thin stature.
One social media user wondered why this was an annual occurrence, writing on X: "Have we upset the Norwegians 
these past few years? Their annual gift seems to get ever more limp and barren."
An account attributed to the beloved cat from 10 Downing Street, Larry, also joined in on the joke last year and said: 
"Judging by the photos of the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree being felled last week in Norway and arriving today, 
it’s been transported as hand luggage on Ryanair."
A Westminster Council spokesperson explained that the tree has been lying on its side for a week, causing parts of 
it to look a little bit flat. However, after shaking up the branches, the tree looked just as it did before it was felled.
Reacting to the tree's appearance being mocked, its official X page wrote: "Looks like you spoke too soon, look at 
me now! â€¦Also it’s not always about what’s on the outside, this is a beautiful tradition which I hope will carry on for 
years to come."

If the lure of festive foods, cosy bars and Christmas markets has got you wanting to get away for the weekend, our 
early gift to you is a roundup of the best European cities to visit during the festive season. 
Ancient streets lined with historic buildings become even more atmospheric when they are lit up for Christmas. The 
festive markets that pop up on cobbled streets sell seasonal treats while visitors skate on ice rinks and take in the 
sound of choirs singing carols in the open air. 
From the effortlessly 'Instagrammable' streets of Vienna to the romance of Paris as the temperature falls, some 
European cities offer it all. 
Many destinations across Europe are covered in lights, decorations and a light dusting of snow for Christmas and 
we've rounded up a selection of the best places to go to soak up the seasonal spirit.
December can often see price hikes on travel and hotel stays, but to help make your Christmas dream more 
affordable, we've found the best value flights and places to stay so you can save some money to buy presents, 
                     Krakow, Poland                    
Christmas in Krakow is a thing of beauty with the festive season and its religious meaning welcomed as a time of 
great joy. As the city is bedecked in the trappings of the season including Christmas trees and lights, nativity scenes 
and carol singing, locals love to get involved on a grand scale. 
I'm a travel writer and these are five great European cities for last-minute Christmas breaks
Live your best gingerbread dreams at one of the city's famous Christmas markets that take over the main square, or 
take in the annual traditional nativity contest, known as Szopki, where local artisans create elaborate miniatures of 
historical Kraków buildings to illustrate scenes from the birth of the baby Jesus. 
With snow expected to fall throughout December, you can warm up with some mulled wine and indulge in some 
hearty Polish food at the festive celebrations in Rynek Glowny.
                     How to get there                   
Wizz Air is offering flights from London Luton to Krakow for £30.99, departing on December 4. Other providers of 
cheap flights to Krakow include East Midlands to Krakow from £43 with Jet2 and Luton to Krakow for £40 with 
Ryanair.
                     Where to stay:                   
The Old Town is at the heart of all the festive action and there are many hotels and hostelries to choose from. 
Depending on your budget you could bed down in the Leone Aparthotel for just £38 a night, take in the views from 
the Sheraton Grand Krakow from £108 a night or splash out on a luxury stay at the Hotel H15 Luxury Palace from 
£215 a night. 
                     Budapest, Hungary                   
Visiting the city just in time for Christmas, festive fans can wrap up warm and wander through the seasonal street 
markets that come to life from November 17 until January 1, 2024. With several different markets to choose from, it 
is the Vorosmarty Square Christmas Market that reigns supreme, thanks to its position in one of Budapest's most 
picturesque cobblestone squares.
Budapest is also home to some incredible thermal pools and a trip to the city wouldn't be the same without taking a 
dip. Absolute bliss in wintertime, the Szechenyi Baths and the historic Rudas Baths promise to revitalise your body 
and soul during your stay. Budapest nightlife takes spa baths to another level, with a selection of thermal pool 
parties happening throughout the season as well as the ruin bars where locals relax in abandoned bnuldingas. 
Another reason to visit Budapest is the incredible traditional Hungarian delicacies such as Goulash, grilled meats 
and sausages and flatbread lepény baked in a clay oven as well as strudels, Sekler cake, beigli, flódni and other 
sweets and fragrant winter beverages. 
                     How to get there:                   
Wizz Air has flights from London Lutoms starting from as little as £26.99 one way on December, 7, while Ryanair is

                     Where to stay:                   
Much of the city's famous nightlife can be found in the Jewish Quarter as can the large Christmas market at St. 
Stephen's Basilica, but staying there can be expensive. Many tourists choose to stay just outside in the 5th district 
where you can find a one-night stay at the City Hotel Matyas from £112 per night or the Danubius Hotel Erzsébet 
City Center for £117 per night.
                     Berlin, Germany                   
Home to some of Europe's earliest Christmas markets, the capital city of Berlin is also famous for its incredible 
history, vibrant social scene and dedication to the Christmas cause. 
With over 80 festive markets scattered across the city, there is no shortage of seasonal shopping, as well as a 
Christmas carnival, skating rink and an iconic Ferris wheel. During the month of December, the city sings along with 
I'm a travel writer and these are five great European cities for last-minute Christmas breaks
the sound of the many carol concerts that take place inside the iconic Berlin Cathedral opening its doors for 
everyone to hear. 
                     How to get there:

                     Where to stay:                   
The city of Berlin has lots of accommodation on offer to suit every traveller. From the cheap and cheerful £56 rooms 
at the Märkischer Hof Hotel to the four-star luxury of the West Grand Berlin Hotel with rooms starting from £220 per 
night,
                     Vienna, Austria                   
The ancient city of Vienna is a festive wonderland packed full of Christmas markets, skating rinks and Gluhvine. 
As one of the most picture-perfect Christmas settings in all of Europe, Vienna comes alive with the sound of advent 
concerts and the smell of Vienna sausage and roasted chestnuts. Head over to Rathausplatz, Vienna's most 
famous Christmas market, and immerse yourself in the crowds of visitors who flock to Vienna to feel festive at 
Christmas time. 
                     How to get there:                   
Ryanair is offering one-way flights from Manchester to Vienna on December, 4 for just £25.51 per person, while 
Wizz Air has flights from London to Vienna starting from £44 in December. 
                     Where to stay:                    
Vienna is full of pretty hotels housed in ancient buildings. Some of the best value hotels we found in December 
include the Hotel Graf Stadion for £133 per night and the Levante Rathuas Apartments for £135 per night.
                     Paris, France                   
The city of love is one of the prettiest places to be at Christmas time. The Eiffel Tower surrounded by a blanket of 
snow is a rare wonder to behold and the twinkling lights of the Christmas street markets transform the city into its 
very own winter wonderland. 
With over a million bulbs lighting up the Champs-Élyséese and a sky full of flowing balloons of the Bercy Village, 
Paris is perfect for some high-end Christmas shopping. There is also an ice skating rink at the Jardin des Tuileries 
and the beautiful vintage fairground at the Musee Des Arts Forains.
                     How to get there:                   
Paris is just a short flight from the UK, with Ryanair flying direct from Manchester to Paris Beauvais for just £14.99 
in December, EasyJet flies from London to Charles De Gaul for £37.99.
                     Where to stay:                   
Paris is not the cheapest city in the world to stay in, but there are some lovely places to spend the festive season if 
you don't mind paying a bit more for it. Some of the most affordable hotels we found include the Hôtel Des Arts-
Bastille for £136 per night, Le Relais du Marais for £147 per night and Serotel Lutèce for £187 per night.
If you would rather book a city break with flights and accommodation included, First Choice is currently offering a 
selection of Christmas market stays with prices starting from £224 per person. Tui and LoveHolidays also have 
great deals on European city breaks between now and Christmas.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) reported a strong increase in passenger numbers, capacity and load factor in 
November. 
The budget airline operator said it carried 4,760,154 passengers, representing a 29.3% increase compared to 
November 2022, at a load factor of 88.4%. 
Capacity was 28.8% higher at 5,384,679 seats. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, capacity rose 27.6%, passenger numbers jumped 34.9% and the load factor increased 
4.9 percentage points to 91.1%. 
The company said it has decided to restart inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova from December 14, but has 
suspended operations in Israel until early January 2024. 
Gerald Khoo at Liberum said the acceleration in both passenger and capacity growth in November compared with 
the trend of recent months "surprised us".
"This comes against a tougher comparative and management had guided to capacity growth slowing," Khoo 
pointed out. 
Retaining a 'hold' rating, Khoo added that although "there was (as usual) no commentary on unit revenues, we 
would see the balance of risks being to the downside with faster growth and flat load factors".
Wizz Air and Ryanair report jump in passenger numbers in November
Separately, Ryanair also posted its traffic numbers, with passenger numbers rising 4% to 11.7 million passengers 
from 11.2 million last year with an unchanged load factor of 92%.

(Alliance News) - London's FTSE 100 is called to open lower on Monday, while Asian equities made an 
underwhelming start to the week, as investors eagerly anticipate Friday's US nonfarm payrolls data. 
Friday's US jobs report could spark a 'Santa rally' for equity markets before the end of the year. Hotter-than-
expected data could prompt the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates higher for longer, however. 
"Investors expect further fall in US jobs openings, less than 200,000 job additions last month with slightly higher pay 
on month-on-month basis. The softer the data, the better the chances of keeping the Fed hawks away from the 
market," Swissquote analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya commented. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said it is still "premature" to speculate on when the US central bank will start 
cutting interest rates. 
Gold added some sparkle during the quiet start to the week, meanwhile, hitting a record high. 
"The slide in yields along with the weakness in the US dollar has also seen gold prices surge, as the yellow metal 
pushed to a new record high above USD2,100 an ounce in Asia trading this morning," CMC Markets analyst 
Michael Hewson commented.

Fitch Ratings maintained its negative outlook on the UK's credit rating, amid uncertainty stemming from the nation's 
final trading relationship with the EU post-Brexit, and high public debt. The 'AA-' rating was maintained, a score 
which nations including France, Ireland and South Korea also share.
"The UK's ratings reflect a high-income, large, diversified and flexible economy, a credible macroeconomic policy 
framework, deep capital markets and sterling's international reserve currency status, which provides ample 
financing flexibility. These strengths are set against high public and external debt, high debt service costs relative to 
peers and some remaining uncertainty regarding the final form of the UK-EU economic relationship post-Brexit," 
Fitch said. Moody's lifted the UK's rating outlook to stable in October, believing "policy predictability has been 
restored" following last year's mini-budget chaos. Fitch fell short of doing the same, however.

Waterford Airport gets more than €12m in private investment for runway extension
Waterford Airport gets more than €12m in private investment for runway 
extension
Transportation Monitor Worldwide

Waterford Airport could see its long-awaited runway extension in place by this time next year, following an 
announcement of more than 12 million in private investment.
It is over seven years since the airport has seen a commercial flight take off from its runway but a partnership 
between existing shareholder the Bolster Group and the Comer Group which develops property on an international 
scale is set to see the necessary infrastructure put in place.
The existing runway has been seen as a barrier to attracting airlines to Waterford, because of its relatively short 
length, and while planning permission has been approved for a longer runway, local interests have been trying to 
attract funding to make this happen.
Almost half of the expected 30 million which is needed to fund the extended runway is coming from the deal with 
the Comer Group, along with local investment, with the remainder hoped to come from public funding.
The new runway will have the capacity to service large and mid-range airliners, such as the widely-used Airbus 320 
and Boeing 737, and backers hope to see Waterford Airport linking up with summer and winter holiday destinations 
across Europe. London is expected to be the first destination, possibly at the end of next year.
The current major shareholder is construction, flooring and engineering firm the Bolster Group, who have been 
driving the development of the airport since the last commercial flights operated from the site in 2016.
Meanwhile, new partners the Comer Group have been behind multi-million pound property deals in the UK and the 
continent including the Royal Connaught Park in Bushey; Mast Quay on the river Thames; Newland Park in 
Buckinghamshire; and The Pyramid in Berlin; as well as Irish developments such as Number One Ballsbridge and 
Milners Square in Dublin.
Waterford Airport gets more than €12m in private investment for runway extension
The investment was announced at an event in the city attended by the Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath.
"I welcome today's announcement of additional private investment in Waterford Airport," Minister McGrath said.
"An extension to the runway would make the south-east an increasingly attractive destination for both leisure and 
business travelers from overseas.
"Similarly, it will make it easier for people across the region to travel internationally. This has the potential to boost 
economic growth in the region in the decade ahead and complement significant investment already planned for 
Waterford including in urban regeneration and the South East Technological University," he added.
'Matched funding'
Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said recently during a visit to Waterford that the principle of "matched funding" remains, 
subject to the business case for the airport being agreed with the Government.
"Further exchequer funding will be required, and I urge all parties to progress the business case as soon as 
possible," Mr Varadkar said.
Waterford Airport opened in 1981 and saw off its first international flights in 1985, with Ryanair providing the 
inaugural flight to London Gatwick.
While it has not hosted commercial passengers since 2016, it is the base for the Coast Guard's R117 helicopter 
and is also used by flight schools, flying clubs and private flights.
In a joint statement Comer Group director Luke Comer and William Bolster, executive of Waterford Airport said: 
"We are delighted to announce the runway expansion, which will re-open up travel to the UK and European 
destinations all year round.
"Those local to the area have had to travel to Dublin or Cork to catch flights over the last seven years and the time 
absolutely felt right to bring the airport back to life with much-needed investment and put Waterford firmly back on 
the international map."
Fine Gael senator and former airport board member, John Cummins, welcomed today's news and said he expects 
the business case for funding to be "very well received" by the Department of Transport.
"I have constantly liaised with the Taoiseach on this matter since I was on the board of the airport. He has been a 
vocal supporter of our goal to develop a runway in the south east capable of servicing the main aircrafts of choice 
by most major airlines, B737s and A320s," he said.

         Lavacolla is imposed as a reference holiday airport in the northwest peninsular: 65% of its users travel for 
reasons related to leisure or visiting relatives, while only 19% do it for business or work reasons; and the remaining 
17% justify other reasons. This is shown in the 2022 report of the terminal recently published by Aena, which offers 
an x-ray of the activity of Rosalía de Castro and also of its passengers. As is already known, the aerodrome 
accounted for 3.2 million passengers last year, 11.4% more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic, beating an 
all-time record. It also recorded 25,000 flights, up 13.6 %, while the cargo terminal experienced an increase of 51.6 
%, reaching 4.9 million tons of goods.
Santiago airport connected Galicia with nine countries and 37 destinations in 2022; it was served by ten 
airlines, five of which were low-cost; and offered a total of 53 routes, 31 domestic and 22 international. Domestic 
routes accounted for 76.5% of traffic, or 2.5 million passengers: a total of 31 routes were offered to 17 Spanish 
destinations. Madrid-Barajas was the most popular connection. It registered 503,000 passengers, 16% of the total; 
followed by Barcelona, with 393,000 users (12%), Palma de Mallorca, with 192,000 (6%), Seville, with 182,000 
(6%), Alicante, with 170,000 (5%), the same figure as Malaga, Gran Canaria (166,000; 5%), Valencia, (151,000; 
5%), Tenerife Sur (120,000; 4%), and Lanzarote, with 114,000 passengers (4%).
         As for international traffic, it represented 24 % of the activity of Rosalía de Castro airport, with 760,700 
passengers. The main foreign market for Lavacolla was the United Kingdom, which represented 6 % of the 
terminal's activity, with just 200,000 passengers; followed by Switzerland, with another 200,000 (5 %); France, with 
100,000; and Italy, with the same figure. From Santiago it was possible to travel directly to 20 foreign destinations 
by means of 22 routes: 5 to France, 3 to Germany, 3 to Switzerland, 3 to the United Kingdom and 2 to Italy, 
according to Aena's EMMA 2022 survey. 
Airlines
         In terms of airlines, Ryanair was once again the leader. It offered 26 routes last year, with 1.56 million 
passengers, which represents 48% of the terminal's total and an increase of 26% of its activity in the Galician 
capital. It was followed by Vueling, with 1.02 million customers in Compostela, growing by 50 % with respect to 
2019, and with a business that, with 18 routes, accounted for 32 % of Lavacolla's offer.
Lavacolla is becoming a holiday airport: only 19% of travelers travel for business purposes
         Iberia Express, which only offered the route to Madrid, was the third airline last year, with 302,777 travelers (9 
%), while EasyJet had three destinations and accounted for 143,178 customers (4 %) in Santiago. Air Nostrum, in 
fifth place, carried 50,364 passengers (2 %) and Iberia 41,146 (1 %). At the same time, Aer Lingus accounted for 
34,572; and Lufthansa, 29,325. The annual report also reveals that five of the ten airlines that operated in Santiago 
last year, just those that are considered low-cost, congregated 95% of Lavacolla's passengers, that is, 3.1 million. 
In addition, it is noted that charter flights represent only 1% of the activity of the airport of the Galician capital: in 
2022, 18,000 people traveled in this modality.    
Traffic peaks in July and August
         72% of the terminal's traffic was concentrated between April and October, with peaks in July and August, 
when 364,000 and 375,000 passengers were recorded, respectively, almost three times more than in January, 
when only 131,000 users were registered.
         On the other hand, the annual report elaborated by the airport manager also offers a profile of the Lavacolla 
passenger. Fifty-two percent of the users who land at the Rosalía de Castro facilities are men, while women 
represent the remaining 48%. A good part of the total, 42 %, are between 30 and 49 years old. Twenty-five percent 
are between 15 and 29 years of age, and another 17% are between 50 and 64 years of age. Those under 15 
account for 10 percent of the total, and those over 64, only six percent.
         Only 23% of the total number of passengers have their residence in Santiago or the province of A Coruña. 
Fifty-four percent of those who traveled last year to or from Lavacolla live in other Spanish provinces, while 23% live 
abroad. With respect to nationalities, 82 % of the travelers had Spanish national identity cards and the remaining 18 
% from other countries.
         So much for Aena's X-ray of Santiago airport in 2022. With only one month to go before the end of 2023, 
everything points to the fact that the figures will still improve this year, taking into account that up to October there 
were 3.086 million passengers, 10.5 % more than in 2022; and 23.8 % more than in 2019.

LOW-COST airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air reported bumper passenger numbers again for November, despite the 
impact of the conflict in Israel and Gaza on their operations.
Wizz flew 4.8 million passengers during the month, up 29% on November 2022, though its load factor remained 
steady at 88%. The FTSE 250 airline has suspended all flights to and from
Israel until 2024 but "continues to monitor the situation on the ground closely, and stands ready to redeploy 
capacity should conditions stabilise". Ryanair reported slower growth, but still flew 11.7 million passengers, up 4%, 
with its flights 92% full. The Irish carrier cancelled 960 flights because of the conflict, about 1.5% of its total journeys 
last month.

First there was the fee to check your bag, then extra legroom, meaning barely enough to begin with. But now the 
budget airline Ryanair has managed to take things a step further. Now travelers can be charged up to $27 to get a 
digital boarding pass with a seat assignment, or they can wait in line to get one printed for free. Furious passengers 
are venting on social media, calling the move disgraceful. A spokesman for Ryanair says passengers have a

Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) are flying in different directions, according to analysts at Deutsche 
Bank.
Central Europe-focused Wizz is downgraded to a 'sell' with its target price slashed to 1,550p from 2,850p, while 
Dublin-listed Ryanair gets a healthy target upgrade to (EURO)24.50 from (EURO)21.00.
Overall, Deutsche Bank says prices in peak periods are approaching a ceiling but off-peak there are gains to be 
had.
Ryanair continues to see healthy premiums and stands out in the short-haul market and can still get a re-rating in 
2024 as this feeds through, especially as Deutsche Bank says its forecasts are below consensus.
For Wizz Air, the reverse is the case and the broker suggests that consensus forecasts are too high, hence the 
downgrade.
Shares in Ryanair were unchanged at (EURO)15.40 while Wizz eased 0.6% to 1,935p.

Ryanair and Wizz Air said passenger numbers soared in November as the travel sector continued its post-
pandemic bounce back.
Customers rushed to book holidays despite the cost-of-living squeeze with travel remaining a top priority for many 
families, the low-cost carriers said.
Analysts said travellers are still 'making up for opportunities lost' during the pandemic. 
Wizz Air carried 4.8m passengers last month, which was 29.3 per cent more than November last year. 
Its load factor - which measures the percentage of available seats that have been sold - was 88.4 per cent during 
the month.
Over the last 12 months, 59.5m passengers have flown with Wizz Air, an increase of 34.9 per cent on the previous 
year.
Meanwhile, Ryanair reported a 4pc jump in passenger numbers to 11.7m and a load factor of 92 per cent in 
November. 
The airline has had 180.8m passengers in the last 12 months, up 14 per cent on 158.4m the year before.

Castellón airport isscheduled to operate a total of 18 scheduled flights to and from the province during the 
December long weekend, from 6 to 10 December, with a total of more than 2,400 seats.
         The infrastructure is thus established as a departure option for those people from Castellón who choose 
to take advantage of the holidays to travel abroad. In total, the province will be connected non-stop with five 
destinations, although the options multiply if linked with another flight. 
The details
         Specifically, the connection to Madrid operated by Air Nostrum, Iberia's franchisee company, has 
scheduled eight frequencies in the coming days, which in turn allow linking with a total of 86 domestic and 
international destinations, thus multiplying the options for travel from the base of Vilanova d'Alcolea.
         Meanwhile, Wizz Air offers two frequencies on the route to Bucharest and Ryanair another two flights 
to London. The latter low-cost company also offers the possibility of traveling to and from Düsseldorf Weeze 
airport , in addition to any of the four aircraft that will operate to or from Brussels.

Low cost airline Ryanair said more than 960 flights were cancelled last month due to war between Israel and 
Hamas.
The Irish carrier's latest passenger statistics showed it operated over 66,400 flights in November, with a 4% 
increase in people flown, at 11.7 million.
Airlines have been forced to suspend flights to Tel Aviv and Jordan after Hamas militants launched an attack on 
Israel on October 7.
Rival easyJet said last week that the subsequent escalation of the conflict in Gaza has also impacted on demand 
for flights in destinations such as Egypt, while it added that bookings were impacted across the board in October 
and November due to the war.

Dec 04, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more passengers 
flew than a year ago. 
The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got cancelled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 60.7% so far this year compared with 6.6% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. Passenger volume has been 
robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic. The company recently reported 
second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023) revenues of $5,361.3 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $5,137.7 million. 
Revenues improved year over year driven by upbeat passenger volumes. Further, traffic grew 11% to 105.4 million 
during the first half of fiscal 2024. On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax grew 59% 
year over year during the first half of fiscal 2024. Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[4] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[5]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.02% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 5.1% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 17.3% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 31.5% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 181.3% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

Ryanair passengers hit with 'scandalous' new fee of up to £21 to board flight
Ryanair passengers hit with 'scandalous' new fee of up to £21 to board flight

Ryanair customers have shared their fury over the new imposed fee 
Digital boarding passes make it quick and easy to breeze through airport check-in and security, but Ryanair 
passengers may find it's no longer a given.
The airline, which already charges extra to print boarding passes, has imposed a new fee on its customers.
According to Ryanair staff, it is now customary for travellers to pay to add a random seat to their booking to access 
the digital boarding pass.
It comes as a crushing blow to savvy jet-setters who have managed to dodge seat selection fees by accepting their 
fate with a randomised allocation.
Now, fliers must pay between £8 and £21 for their e-pass, or face long queues at the airport to get a physical one.
The budget airline already charges extra for additional hand luggage, hold luggage and boarding pass printing, like 
most other carriers.
But now passengers have found that seat selection is no longer something they can easily opt out of - even if 
they're happy with a random allocation.
It means Ryanair customers face long queues for what could be hours just to get their boarding pass 
Airport staff reportedly told The Mail on Sunday that the change, which has been rolled out in recent days, had 
caused outrage among customers.
And it's clear to see on social media, with several people having taken to X, formerly Twitter to share their anger.
Ryanair passengers hit with 'scandalous' new fee of up to £21 to board flight
Just yesterday, one person wrote: "@Ryanair I just can’t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to 
create a boarding pass unless they buy a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue to do so for no other reason 
for you to make a few quid. Scandalous."
@Ryanair I just can’t believe your new policy of not allowing passengers to create a boarding pass unless they buy 
a seat, forcing them to join a check-in queue to do so for no other reason for you to make a few quid. Scandalous. 
pic.twitter.com/48SMNrbMSV
Another wrote: "When you thought @Ryanair couldn’t sink any lower, they find a way to force you to buy a seat. 
How is this legal, please? Isn’t the whole point of online check-in to avoid people queueing at the airport???"
On the Ryanair app, the airline states that those who queue to collect their boarding pass "will not be charged an 
extra fee", which means customers are not subject to the usual £20 printing charge.
This existing £20 tariff is imposed on those who need their boarding pass printed because they have not checked in 
online, or perhaps because they have checked in but are unable to show a boarding pass.
Reasons for being charged the re-print fee include losing the paper copy, not having downloaded the Ryanair app, 
or even a dead phone battery which makes the e-pass inaccessible.
It means passengers face an added cost built into their journey every time they fly with the budget airline, which 
already charges for extra luggage and seat selection.
Prices for priority boarding and two cabin bags stand at between £6 and £38 with a 10kg checked bag between 
£11.99 and £35.99.
A 20kg checked-in bag costs between £18.99 and £59.99 depending on when it is booked.
Ryanair told Express.co.uk: "There is no charge for a Ryanair digital boarding pass. All Ryanair passengers can 
pay for a reserved seat if they so wish or if passengers wish to avoid this seat fee, they can select a randomly 
allocated seat entirely free of charge."

HAVING charged passengers to reserve a seat, stow a suitcase and print a boarding pass, you might have thought 
Ryanair had run out of add-ons to squeeze out of its customers.
But now the budget airline appears to have come up with yet another wheeze, with fliers told they must pay to add a 
random seat if they wish to receive their digital boarding pass. Those who refuse to pay between £8 and £21 are 
told to queue at the airport to receive a printed boarding pass.
Airport staff told The Mail on Sunday the change, which has been rolled out in recent days, had caused outrage 
with customers.
Vivien Lovrin booked to fly from London to Germany last Thursday and having opted not to pay extra to reserve a 
seat, proceeded to checkin with a randomly allocated spot.
But after filling in her details, the Ryanair app told her: 'Check-in done! Get your boarding pass now and avoid 
queuing at the airport by adding a seat.'
On clicking through she was told to pay a fee to secure a random seat - or else face yet another airport queue to 
get her boarding pass.
She said: 'When you thought Ryanair couldn't sink any lower, they find a way to force you to buy a seat. How is this 
legal?
'Isn't the whole point of online check-in to avoid people queuing at the airport?'
Passengers' anger as Ryanair charges £21 for e-boarding pass
Ciaran Murtagh was faced with the same issue. He said: 'So Ryanair, you are making travellers, who do not wish to 
book a seat, queue up at a desk and have their boarding pass printed. That's great for the environment and another 
cheap shot at passengers to pay more to travel. A new low for Ryanair. Absolutely disgraceful.'
Fabien Mauroy, who was flying out of London on Friday, commented about Ryanair on X (formerly Twitter): 'Worse 
experience for people, long queue at airports, [and] polluting planet for money.'
The new fee makes a mockery of a £55 fine the budget firm imposes on passengers to print out their boarding pass 
at the airport if they don't check-in online.
Italian traveller Marcello Maggio said: 'Ryanair says I must check in online, but it doesn't give me the boarding pass 
online to force me to pay for a seat. What am I buying with the ticket if not a seat to fly?'
Other add-ons for those who book online include £4 to £15 to reserve a seat, while bags cost between £20 and 
£60, with an excess fee of around £10 per kilo. If a passenger requires oxygen for medical reasons they are not 
allowed to bring their own - and must pay £55 to use Ryanair's. The latest fee does not appear to affect all 
travellers, with some saying they got a digital boarding pass for free.
A Ryanair spokesman said: 'Passengers have the choice of choosing a seat for a small fee or be randomly 
allocated a seat free of charge.' The firm did not respond to claims that it was effectively forcing customers to pay 
for a digital boarding pass.

Q I have just received an email headed: "Make your Christmas shopping stress-free." I'm all in favour of that. The 
invitation is from Ryanair and urges me to "gift your loved ones a Ryanair gift card". My brother has a house near 
Pisa in Italy and regularly flies there on Ryanair. Should I be tempted to send him £100 worth of flights?
Sarah A
A This is a question I tend to get each December, and my answer remains the same: no. I welcome the general 
trend towards giving experiences rather than goods. What better, you might wonder, than the gift of travel? But if 
you buy a gift card for a particular airline, you risk providing a distinctly inferior experience.
Airlines love selling vouchers. They take in cash in exchange for a future obligation to offer air travel to the same 
value; Ryanair even asks the donor to pay an extra £2 on top for administration. Some people will forget to use their 
present by the expiry date (a year after issue in the case of Ryanair), which then gifts the carrier some useful free 
money. Some travel gift vouchers, but not Ryanair's, insist the voucher is used in one go; your brother would not 
need to use the full £100 in a single transaction, and any balance is carried forward to use within the year.
Yet even if your brother is assiduous about using the voucher, it is not a helpful asset. Ryanair has a good range of 
flights to Pisa, from Birmingham, East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted, Manchester and Prestwick. But it has 
no monopoly from the UK: easyJet flies from London Gatwick and Manchester, while British Airways departs from 
London Heathrow. If a rival airline has a more convenient departure airport, timing or fare, you will inadvertently 
prevent him from the ideal itinerary.
May I offer an alternative? Credit his bank account with £102 (which is what a £100 Ryanair gift card would have 
cost you), and give him a card explaining that you would like to buy him some flying. You might even want to print 
Should I buy my brother a Ryanair Christmas voucher?
out my response to you, to show him what you were thinking. And thank you for the opportunity to remind people to 
steer clear of travel company-specific gift vouchers this Christmas.

'Venice of Portugal' is only a short flight away from UK airports 
With picturesque canals, vibrant boats, and a thriving fishing industry, Aveiro, in Portugal, shares many similarities 
with its Italian counterpart.
The city, half the size of Venice, boasts twice the space to explore, minus the overwhelming crowds.
During summer, temperatures reach up to 29°C, creating an ideal setting for exploring canals and relaxing on 
sandy beaches like Barra Beach and São Jacinto Beach. What sets it apart is its wallet-friendly perks.
A pint of beer won't cost you more than £1.80, and dining out at a reasonable restaurant comes in at around £6.98. 
Aveiro welcomes budget-conscious travellers with open arms.
Getting to Aveiro is hassle-free with direct flights from various UK cities, including London, Leeds, Bristol, Belfast, 
Birmingham, and Edinburgh.

Aveiro station 
Ryanair and easyJet offer return tickets starting at just £26, with with a short two-and-a-half-hour flight time. After 
landing in Porto, a scenic one-hour drive takes you to Aveiro.
Accommodations won't break the bank, with options like the four-star Costa do Sal Hotel Boat Lounge offering 
stays for as low as £27.50 per person for a night. Comparatively, the overall cost of a trip to Aveiro is significantly 
more budget-friendly than its Venetian counterpart.
'Venice of Portugal ' is a short flight away from UK airports and pints are less than £2
While Aveiro is smaller than Venice, it compensates with attractions. Moliceiro Boat Tours along the Ria de Aveiro 
offer unique views, starting at £12 per person.
Lighthouse and beach at Praia da Barra, Aveiro 
Indulge in Portuguese sweets at Oficina do Doce or explore the Paiva Walkways for £10.44 per person. English is 
widely spoken in Aveiro, and the local currency is the Euro, with £10 fetching approximately €11.52.
There are currently no Covid restrictions, and British visitors can stay for up to 90 days without a visa, provided their 
passport has at least three months' validity beyond the departure date.
For an affordable, sun-soaked escape reminiscent of Venice, Aveiro is a hidden gem waiting to be explored.

The following information was released by the Adam Smith Institute:
Tim Worstall
3 December 2023
This is true of booze, of drugs, of tobacco and, yes, jet engine parts:
Ryanair has found "fake parts" in two of its aircraft engines during scheduled maintenance checks, becoming the 
latest airline to be impacted by a brewing scandal.
The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been 
removed from the engines, the low-cost carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary told Bloomberg News.
It comes as the global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators 
scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment.
We do not, of course condone this. But we do know quite a bit about it as a result of having been out there in that 
international and global economy for all these decades.
The difficulty is that the nut, bolt or screw for a jet engine is worth 5x to 10x with the right piece of paper than it is 
without. Let's not make the situation more complicated than that. It's righteous that it should too, traceability of parts 
in something so complex, so horrendous in effects if failure occurs, is a very good idea indeed.
But, it's always going to happen that people will try to trade across a 5x to 10x price difference. Note that this is not 
a result of markets or capitalism. This isn't neoliberalism run riot - this is just what happens among humans. This 
also doesn't mean that people who do even fake jet engine parts should not be righteously jugged, not that we 
should not investigate allegations of it - as here, allegations only so far.
A WARNING TO PROHIBITIONISTS
What it does mean is that governments simply cannot go around creating 5x and 10x price differences as will be 
true of banning tobacco and so on. Because people simply will trade across those differences. As they do with 
drugs, at large scale, and as currently also does happen with both tobacco and booze.
With jet engines the consumers - the airlines - absolutely do not want fake parts at any price. For knowing use of 
them would likely violate both their insurances and also their licences. Now switch the model to one where 
consumers do desire the item on offer - drugs, booze, baccy. There is that demand, there is that profit margin, trade 
will happen across it.
This then being the message for the prohibitionists. Even if it were true that society would be better without these 
things - it wouldn't - it still won't work. And there's absolutely no point at all in implementing a policy that won't work. 
So, don't.

Travel expert Megan Gougeon has taken over 300 flights in the past decade 
A travel expert, who has taken more than 300 flights, has revealed some surprising facts about plane that 
passengers are never told. 
In a YouTube video, Megan Gougeon warned her followers to steer clear of airline blankets and explains why 
wearing socks is always a bad idea.
"For those worried about safety, Megan suggests choosing seats "in the middle of the last row at the back of the 
plane." She says these spots have the "highest survival rates in the event of a crash."
Megan explains that this feature, known as a "bleed hole," plays a significant role in maintaining cabin pressure and 
preventing the window from fogging up.
She further explains that commercial plane windows typically have three layers - outer, middle, and inner - made of 
acrylic and glass. 
READ MORE: The airport used by Ryanair a crazy 68 miles from the city it's meant to be in
The circular outlet known as a 'bleed hole' is 'crucial for regulating cabin pressure' 
The inner plastic layer prevents passengers from accessing the middle and outer glass panes. The middle pane 
has a 'bleed hole' in it, followed by an air gap, and then the outer pane of glass.
To keep the cabin safe, it's important to manage the pressure between the inner and outer window panes. 
Travel expert reveals plane secrets including warning about in-flight blankets
She reveals a secret airlines don't usually share: there should be life vests under every seat. But sometimes, 
passengers take them, so it's worth checking your seat before take-off. If you can't find one, tell a flight attendant 
straight away.
Another feature you might not have noticed, she said, is the ashtray in the bathroom. Despite smoking being illegal 
on planes, some passengers break the rules. So, planes must have a safe place to extinguish a cigarette.
She warned of the blankets that have been wrapped in plastic 
Do not walk around in your socksAnother tip from Megan is to avoid walking around the plane in your socks. She 
explains that the "little droplets on the ground aren't always water," and "the aisle floors also accumulate germs that 
are tracked out of the airplane bathroom."
By keeping your shoes on, she says, "you're not just avoiding the unpleasantness of bathroom spills but you are 
also protecting yourself from a variety of germs that could lead to a variety of foot conditions."
Megan recently discovered that pillows and blankets on long-haul flights are reused and may only be clean for the 
first flight of the day.
Catrina McGrail, another former flight attendant, says the best way to ensure a blanket is clean is to make sure it's 
wrapped in plastic.
"Using the sealed plastic bags means passengers would know their blanket would be fresh," she said.

Highlight: After one of the coldest nights since March, the Met Office has warned of more snow and ice
Body
The UK has been hit by a wave of snow and ice  this weekend as a major incident was declared and flights were 
grounded.  
The coldest overnight temperature this winter was recorded in northern Scotland, the Met Office  said, as Altnaharra 
in the Highland region dropped to -12.5C.
It comes as thousands of people across Cumbria woke up without power on Sunday morning after heavy snowfall  
affected Electricity North West’s service. 
East Midlands Airport was forced to temporarily close its runway after heavy snow  blanketed the ground. 
The airport said in a tweet at about 8.10am today: “Due to snow, our runway is temporarily closed. We will update 
you as soon as possible.”
On Saturday morning, Glasgow Airport suspended all flights as many inbound flights were diverted, delayed or 
cancelled. The inbound Wizz Air flight from Budapest landed at Edinburgh, while a Ryanair jet from Malaga touched 
down in Prestwick.
Yellow weather warnings for snow and ice  are currently in place in large parts of Scotland, the Midlands, Wales 
and the North East, with snow and ice set to disrupt roads and railways.
There is a yellow warning for rain from midnight until 6pm Monday which affects most of southern England, Wales 
and the West Midlands.
                       For the latest on the cold weather across the UK, follow our live blog                                        
Mapped: Snow and ice Met Office warnings as UK hit by overnight freeze
The freezing weather is being caused by a blast of cold air from northern Scandinavia, resulting in a particularly 
cold snap for many northern and eastern parts of the UK.
After a relatively mildNovember , temperatures plummeted this week  with snow falling on Wednesday morning 
across parts of Yorkshire and Scotland. The flurries continued into Thursday evening with North Yorkshire Police 
reporting 100 cars stuck on the A171, between Whitby and Scarborough.
And on Friday morning, icy conditions on the roads resulted in 20 schools in County Durham closing.
In London, where commuters woke up to temperatures of -4C  on Friday morning, mayor Sadiq Khan activated a 
“severe weather emergency protocol” for accommodation to be opened for rough sleepers.
The first snow of the season was even reported in parts of the capital including West Hampstead, Ealing and 
Islington.
Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “Last night was a cold night across the country  with a widespread 
frost as temperatures fell well below freezing for most.
“Colder conditions are now covering all areas of the UK and we will see little change as we go into the weekend.
“Daytime temperatures will be rooted in single figures and overnight temperatures falling well below freezing in 
many places. We will continue to see wintry showers at times and where these showers fall as rain there is a risk of 
icy patches forming.”
The yellow weather warnings in place warn of disruption to roads and railways, and of the risk of icy patches on 
roads, pavements and footpaths.
Alongside the Met Office warnings, the government’s UK Health Security Agency has amber cold health alerts in 
place for five regions: the East Midlands, West Midlands, North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber 
until December 5.
The alerts warn of the cold weather impacting the regions’ health services.

Near the seafront at Nice there's a small shop selling vintage postcards. The majority feature sunbathing beauties, 
but the older, black-and-white ones show overcoated figures contemplating an empty beach.
These are the winter visitors, the 'hivernants' - after 'hiver', the French word for winter. From the 1860s until the 
1930s, 'high season' on the Riviera was from November to April. Various physical and psychological ailments were 
thought to be alleviated by the mild winter climate, bracing sea air and high blue skies.
Having visited Nice in summer, I thought it time to sample the winter experience.
Of course, the hivernants went by train, most famously the Train Bleu sleeper from Paris.
Today, the sleek Eurostar from London fits the bill and, on arrival in Paris, the Metro is fine for the transfer from 
Gare du Nord to south-facing Gare de Lyon.
Kirker Holidays Nice starting from com). The price sharing, including Eurostar and TGV Also includes private from

Though the train has long gone, inside the station the gilded Train Bleu restaurant beckons - with its frescoes 
showing heavenly Riviera scenes.
Then it's the TGV for a swift transfer to Nice. Even in standard class, your seat is wide, and there is a buffet car 
where you can eat a croque monsieur, drink wine and stare out of the cinematic windows.

convivial restaurants, the invigorating escape withou....
You only realise the speed of the train when it runs alongside a road - going twice the speed of the cars.
But they slow down as they reach the Riviera coast, and you approach Nice just as the sky turns pink over the Med.
My hotel, the three-star Villa Rivoli, was built in the 1890s especially for the hivernants. It's a minute from the sea, 
cosy and quiet, with rooms featuring marble fireplaces and retro fabric wallpapers.
There was time before dinner for a stroll.
In winter, the palm trees along the Prom are wrapped in fairylights which contrast beautifully with the dark blue night 
sky. The waves are foamier than in summer, and the sea seems louder - perhaps because there are only a couple 
of dozen people on the Prom, as opposed to thousands.
I sat on a sea-facing bench to smoke a cigar. Nearby, a Frenchman was doing the same.
'Ten today - better tomorrow,' he said.

We got talking and I said I would like to retire to Nice. 'Oh but you are obviously not old enough,' he said.
Charming man. It was a novelty to walk through the pastel-coloured labyrinth of the old town without having to 
constantly step aside for people.
In winter, you will have a whole alleyway or a small square to yourself. In the largest square, Cours Saleya, the 
terraces of the restaurants are packed in summer, but hardy sorts still dine outside in winter, when the prices are 
lower (although the big winter saving is on accommodation).
In the unpretentious, blue-painted interior of La Cambuse, one of the smallest and oldest restaurants, I ate clams 
and spaghetti - which seemed appropriate, Nice having been part of Italy until 1860.
The next morning was bright blue. On my stroll, I bumped into the cigar smoker again. He gestured to an 
illuminated display outside a pharmacy. It gave the temperature: 11C.
You realise, in the peacefulness of winter, that Nice is an inherently old-fashioned sort of place, with all the palaces 
and villas in the flamboyant, Belle Epoque style of the late 19th Century, the sleepy antique shops, the mellow 
sound of the tram bells.
If you climb the steps of the Castle Hill, at the west end of Nice's bay, the city is arrayed below you.
It looks hot, even in winter: the palms are evergreen after all, the sky and sea are as blue as in summer - and the 
orange trees in the streets bear their fruit in winter.
There are orange trees, too, in the winter garden of the Musee Massena on the Prom, whose marble rooms contain 
posters and photographs from hivernant era.
Those days are also evoked in the Musee des Beaux Arts, a little way inland. I recommend the rooms featuring the 
paintings of Raoul Dufy, who lived in Nice. In wintry blues, he obsessively painted the domed Casino that stood on 
a short pier from 1891 until 1942 and was a social centre for the hivernants.
I encountered one other person in those rooms. 'Bonne journee,' he said, before he departed. Such small, civilised 
exchanges are a regular feature of Nice in winter.

That evening, I repeated the seafood and pasta theme - this time with squid at Le Bistrot d'Antoine, a convivial, 
rustic-looking place in the old town. It was packed, even though the surrounding streets were quiet. This meal, like

Here, you see the former hotels that accommodated the hivernants. On a sunny winter's day, their ornate white 
plasterwork still dazzles against the blue sky. But they are now luxury flats with hair salons, pharmacies and banks 
on their ground floors.
Their elderly, well-preserved residents, in their tailored cashmere coats, are living the hivernant life. It doesn't seem 
to be doing them any harm.

Restaurant (and Boutique Cookery School) and the Spanish restaurant Cava Bodega in Galway city. In 2015 he

Copenhagen is a culinary mecca with an amazing density of wonderful restaurants, cafés and wine bars. I’ve 
always had a fascination with Nordic cuisine and Copenhagen is a huge inspiration for me. I travel there once or 
twice a year, squeezing so much into every trip. Food culture is to the fore in Copenhagen and it excels at food 
tourism, something I feel we could do way more here in Ireland.
It’s famous for “new Nordic cuisine”, but while many of Copenhagen’s Michelin-starred restaurants still maintain this 
unique approach, other restaurants do not limit themselves to this dogma. Copenhagen is also famous for its 
bakeries and pretty much pioneered the global resurgence in sourdough.
                   Getting there and getting around                   
Fly direct from Dublin on SAS or Ryanair. You can hop on the metro straight from Kastrup airport and reach the city 
centre in about 20 minutes. Taxis are very expensive.
What makes Copenhagen such a joy to get around is that you can cycle everywhere — simply rent a bike. The 
locals cycle everywhere and there are designated cycle ways across the city, but be careful in rush hour — it gets a 
little dog-eat-dog in the cycle lane.
                   When to visit and best places to base yourself                   
JP McMahon’s insider guide to Copenhagen
I love to visit at any time of the year, though I think early summer in Copenhagen is perhaps the nicest. It’s quite 
cold in winter, but the classically styled city centre amusement park Tivoli Gardens (
tivoli.dk/en
) is particularly fantastic and festive at Christmas time.
Public transport in Copenhagen is really good, so anywhere in the city centre — Indre By — is perfect as a base. 
However, I love Norrebro and Vesterbro is very good for nightlife. I often stay in the Wakeup hotels (
wakeupcopenhagen.com
). They’re cheap, clean and cheerful and may help towards offsetting the money you’re going to spend on food and 
wine.
                   One unforgettable restaurant                   
I think I’ve eaten in Noma (
noma.dk
) seven or eight times, but my most memorable meal was the first time I ate there — in its former location — when I 
first visited the city in 2015. That weekend we also ate at Geranium (
geranium.dk
) and several other Michelin-starred spots — quite a lot in two days, even for me! The sheer brilliance of the food at 
Noma will for ever remain with me. Aniar’s first head chef, Enda McEvoy [the co-owner of Ean in Galway and 
former chef-owner of Michelin-starred Loam], did a stage [chef internship] at Noma in 2011 and that influenced so 
much of what we do in Aniar, from zoning in on local and wild food to embracing seaweed.
                   Plus a couple more to try                   
While Noma is the most memorable, I’ve had some amazing meals at Kadeau (
kadeau.dk
), now one of my favourite restaurants on the planet, and others now sadly closed like Amass, Geist and Relae. A 
meal at the multisensory restaurant Alchemist (
alchemist.dk
) takes about six hours and is global in its molecular approach rather than new Nordic.
Christian Puglisi is a benchmark of good cooking in Copenhagen. He began with Relae and Manfreds — where I 
had the most transformative beef tartare of my life, so much so it inspired me to open Tartare in Galway His pizzeria 
Baest (
baest.dk/en
) is probably the best pizza in Copenhagen.
On my last trip we visited an Italian restaurant called Barabba (
barabba.dk
), where they make their own pasta and serve memorable small plates coupled with a great wine list. For my next 
trip, two Michelin-starred Koan (
JP McMahon’s insider guide to Copenhagen
koancph.dk
) is top of my wish list.
                   Where to get coffee                   
Copenhagen has a great café culture. A favourite spot for coffee or breakfast is Atelier September (
cafeatelierseptember.com
). Its smorrebrod (open-faced rye bread sandwich) is worth trying. If you want to splash out on brunch, check out 
Palaegade (
formelfamily.dk/palaegade
).
                   A great place for a drink                   
My favourite wine bar is Ved Stranden 10 (
vedstranden10.dk
) and as locations go it doesn’t get much better, right by the canal. It was at the forefront of the natural wine 
revolution that is now widespread across the world. Clubs open round the clock in the city but my dancing days are 
over! These days after a good meal, a couple of glasses of wine in a relaxed bar for the evening suits me.
                   Watching the budget                   
Copenhagen makes Ireland look cheap, so expect to pay more for everything, from your coffee in the morning to 
your glass of wine in the evening. I think budgeting a couple of hundred euros a day would cover everything. Fine 
dining is obviously the extreme end of the spectrum and can blow the budget, but even good casual dining spots 
will set you back about €200. They have a higher tax on food and wine in restaurants — 25 per cent, Ireland is 13.5 
per cent Also, wages are considerably better for chefs in restaurants over in Denmark so you pay the price of this 
difference.
                   One thing you must see or do                   
The boat around the canals is a little “touristy” but does give you a good bearing on the city. There’s lots of different 
ones, from eco-friendly GoBoat and kayak trips to the bigger Netto and classic canal boats — the latter two are 
included in Wonderful Copenhagen’s Copenhagen Card (
copenhagencard.com
; from €62 for 24-hour adult tickets). In terms of overhyped touristy things, I wouldn’t recommend 
                   The Little Mermaid                   
 statue.
                   Copenhagen summed up in one sentence?                    
A beautiful, historic city with some of the best restaurants, cafés and wine bars — a few days spent in Copenhagen 
will add more hygge to your life.

@mistereatgalway Copenhagen is a culinary mecca with an amazing density of wonderful restaurants, cafés and 
wine bars. I've always had a fascination with Nordic cuisine and Copenhagen is a huge inspiration for me. I travel 
there once or twice a year, squeezing so much into every trip. Food culture is to the fore in Copenhagen and it 
excels at food tourism, something I feel we could do way more here in Ireland.
It's famous for "new Nordic cuisine", but while many of Copenhagen's Michelinstarred restaurants still maintain this 
approach, other restaurants do not limit themselves to this dogma. Copenhagen is also famous for its bakeries and 
pretty much pioneered the global resurgence in sourdough. GETTING THERE AND GETTING AROUND Fly direct 
from Dublin on SAS or Ryanair. You can hop on the metro straight from Kastrup airport and reach the city centre in 
about 20 minutes. Taxis are very expensive.
What makes Copenhagen such a joy to get around is that you can cycle everywhere - simply rent a bike. The locals 
cycle everywhere and there are designated cycle ways across the city, but be careful in rush hour - it gets a little 
dog-eat-dog in the cycle lane. WHEN TO VISIT AND BEST PLACES TO BASE YOURSELF I love to visit at any 
time of the year, though I think early summer in Copenhagen is perhaps the nicest. It's quite cold in winter, but the 
I know the perfect place: Copenhagen, Denmark JP McMahon, the culinary genius behind Galway city's Aniar 
and Cava Bodega restaurants, reveals his all-time top s....
classically styled city centre amusement park Tivoli Gardens (tivoli.dk/en) is particularly fantastic and festive at 
Christmas time. Public transport in Copenhagen is really good, so anywhere in the city centre - Indre By - is perfect 
as a base. However, I love Norrebro and Vesterbro is very good for nightlife. I often stay in the Wakeup hotels 
(www.wakeupcopenhagen.com). They're cheap, clean and cheerful and may help towards offsetting the money 
you're going to spend on food and wine.
ONE UNFORGETTABLE RESTAURANT I think I've eaten in Noma (noma.dk) seven or eight times, but my most 
memorable meal was the first time I ate there - in its former location - when I first visited the city in 2015. That 
weekend we also ate at Geranium (geranium.dk) and several other Michelinstarred spots - quite a lot in two days, 
even for me! The sheer brilliance of the food at Noma will for ever remain with me. Aniar's first head chef, Enda 
McEvoy [the coowner of Ean in Galway and former chef-owner of the Michelin-starred Loam], did a stage [chef 
internship] at Noma in 2011 and that influenced so much of what we do in Aniar, from zoning in on local and wild 
food to embracing seaweed. PLUS A COUPLE MORE TO TRY While Noma is the most memorable, I've had some 
amazing meals at Kadeau (kadeau.dk), now one of my favourite restaurants on the planet, and others now sadly 
closed like Amass, Geist and Relae. A meal at the multisensory restaurant Alchemist (alchemist.dk) takes six hours 
and is global in its molecular approach rather than new Nordic.
Christian Puglisi is a benchmark of good cooking in Copenhagen. He began with Relae and Manfreds - where I had 
the most transformative beef tartare of my life, so much so it inspired me to open Tartare in Galway His pizzeria 
Baest (baest.dk/ en) is probably the best pizza in Copenhagen.
On my last trip we visited an Italian restaurant called Barabba (barabba.dk), where they make their own pasta and 
serve memorable small plates coupled with a great wine list. For my next trip, the two Michelin-starred Koan 
(koancph.dk) is top of my wish list.
WHERE TO GET COFFEE Copenhagen has a great café culture. A favourite spot for coffee or breakfast is Atelier 
September (cafeatelier www.september.com). Its smorrebrod (open-faced rye bread sandwich) is worth trying. If 
you want to splash out on brunch, check out Palaegade (formelfamily.dk/ palaegade).
A GREAT PLACE FOR A DRINK My favourite wine bar is Ved Stranden 10 (vedstranden 10.dk) and as locations 
go it doesn't get much better, right by the canal. It was at the forefront of the natural wine revolution that is now 
widespread across the world. Clubs open round the clock in the city but my dancing days are over! These days 
after a good meal, a couple of glasses of wine in a relaxed bar for the evening suits me. WATCHING THE BUDGET 
Copenhagen makes Ireland look cheap, so expect to pay more for everything, from your coffee in the morning to 
your glass of wine in the evening. I think budgeting a couple of hundred euros a day would cover everything. Fine 
dining is obviously the extreme end of the spectrum and can blow the budget, but even good casual dining spots 
will set you back about (EURO)200. They have a higher tax on food and wine in restaurants - 25 per cent, Ireland is 
13.5 per cent. Also, wages are considerably better for chefs in restaurants over in Denmark so you pay the price of 
this difference.
ONE THING YOU MUST SEE OR DO The boat around the canals is a little touristy but does give you a good 
bearing on the city. There's lots of different ones, from eco-friendly GoBoat and kayak trips to the bigger Netto and 
classic canal boats - the latter two are included in Wonderful Copenhagen's Copenhagen Card 
(copenhagencard.com; from (EURO)62 for 24-hour adult tickets). In terms of overhyped touristy things, I wouldn't 
recommend The Little Mermaid statue. COPENHAGEN SUMMED UP IN ONE SENTENCE? A beautiful, historic 
city with some of the best restaurants, cafés and wine bars - a few days spent in Copenhagen will add more hygge

Two Ryanair planes have been identified as having fake engine parts, the airline's boss has admitted.
It is the latest airline to be hit by the scandal which had already affected Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and 
Delta Air Lines.
Parts have been found during maintenance checks in Brazil and Texas.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the fake components are from UK supplier AOG Technics, which is 
not one of Ryanair's approved suppliers, it was reported.
Ryanair was asked for comment.
At the time of publishing AOG Technics website had been taken down.

IT seems improbable that Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is joining in the national wave of appreciation for Shane 
MacGowan's visionary flair and creative brilliance. For on the subject of his favourite RTÉ radio shows, the budget 
airline founder showed little patience for music or phone-in chat shows like Liveline, much preferring a diet of 
current affairs and news.
Comparing the State broadcaster with Aer Lingus in the 1980s, he said: 'RTÉ is probably overstaffed, it's certainly 
badly run. Would I like to see RTÉ survive? Yes, clearly, I think the area of news in RTÉ does a very good job, but 
there's lots of areas of RTÉ that frankly, if they disappeared tomorrow, I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.'
O'Leary singled out Joe Duffy's religious programmes and Liveline as expendable, adding 'Ryan Tubridy playing 
records for an hour' was 'a complete waste of time'. Tastes differ, of course, and it behoves the State broadcaster to 
cater for all.
But isn't it ironic that the programmes Michael O'Leary values most are those that the ruthlessly commercial 
entrepreneur would probably take an axe to and replace with cheapas-chips chat shows had he the running of a 
broadcast service?

RYANAIR chief Michael O'Leary has called for tighter regulations on aircraft parts suppliers after the budget carrier 
was hit by an international scam.
The airline found fake engine parts in two of its planes during maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil, which have 
since been removed.
Major US carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also found suspect parts believed 
to have come from a bogus UK-based supplier.
Mr O'Leary said: "Given the level of paperwork that exists, I'm not quite sure how anybody was able to come up 
with dodgy parts."
The UK's aviation watchdog announced in August it was "investigating the supply of a large number of suspect 
unapproved parts" that could be traced to one supplier.
The Civil Aviation Authority issued a safety notice warning airlines that some of the parts were used in engines fitted 
to British planes.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in August it was examining reports of parts with suspected 
falsified documents.

Dec 03, 2023( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  
 This is true of booze, of drugs, of tobacco and, yes, jet engine parts[1]:  
Ryanair has found 'fake parts' in two of its aircraft engines during scheduled maintenance checks, becoming the 
latest airline to be impacted by a brewing scandal. 
The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been 
removed from the engines, the low-cost carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary told Bloomberg News. 
It comes as the global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators 
scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment. 
We do not, of course condone this. But we do know quite a bit about it as a result of having been out there in that 
international and global economy for all these decades.  
The difficulty is that the nut, bolt or screw for a jet engine is worth 5x to 10x with the right piece of paper than it is 
without. Let's not make the situation more complicated than that. It's righteous that it should too, traceability of parts 
in something so complex, so horrendous in effects if failure occurs, is a very good idea indeed. 
But, it's always going to happen that people will try to trade across a 5x to 10x price difference. Note that this is not 
a result of markets or capitalism. This isn't neoliberalism run riot - this is just what happens among humans. This 
also doesn't mean that people who do even fake jet engine parts should not be righteously jugged, not that we 
should not investigate allegations of it - as here, allegations only so far. 
What it does mean is that governments simply cannot go around creating 5x and 10x price differences as will be 
true of banning tobacco and so on. Because people simply will trade across those differences. As they do with 
drugs, at large scale, and as currently also does happen with both tobacco and booze.  
With jet engines the consumers - the airlines - absolutely do not want fake parts at any price. For knowing use of 
them would likely violate both their insurances and also their licences. Now switch the model to one where 
consumers do desire the item on offer - drugs, booze, baccy. There is that demand, there is that profit margin, trade 
will happen across it. 
This then being the message for the prohibitionists. Even if it were true that society would be better without these 
things - it wouldn't - it still won't work. And there's absolutely no point at all in implementing a policy that won't work. 
So, don't.

Holidaymakers fury at Ryanair as budget airline charges passengers a whopping £21 for an e-boarding pass

Passengers told by budget airline to pay to reserve a seat or queue at the airport
Having charged passengers to reserve a seat, stow a suitcase and print a boarding pass, you might have thought 
Ryanair had run out of add-ons to squeeze out of its customers.
But now the budget airline appears to have come up with yet another wheeze, with fliers told they must pay to add a 
random seat if they wish to receive their digital boarding pass. Those who refuse to pay between £8 and £21 are 
told to queue at the airport to receive a printed boarding pass.
Airport staff told The Mail on Sunday the change, which has been rolled out in recent days, had caused outrage 
with customers.
Vivien Lovrin booked to fly from London to Germany last Thursday and having opted not to pay extra to reserve a 
seat, proceeded to check-in with a randomly allocated spot.
But after filling in her details, the Ryanair app told her: 'Check-in done! Get your boarding pass now and avoid 
queuing at the airport by adding a seat.'
On clicking through she was told to pay a fee to secure a random seat - or else face yet another airport queue to 
get her boarding pass.
She said: 'When you thought Ryanair couldn't sink any lower, they find a way to force you to buy a seat. How is this 
legal?
'Isn't the whole point of online check-in to avoid people queuing at the airport?'
Holidaymakers fury at Ryanair as budget airline charges passengers a whopping £21 for an e-boarding pass
Ciaran Murtagh was faced with the same issue. He said: 'So Ryanair, you are making travellers, who do not wish to 
book a seat, queue up at a desk and have their boarding pass printed. That's great for the environment and another 
cheap shot at passengers to pay more to travel. A new low for Ryanair. Absolutely disgraceful.'
Fabien Mauroy, who was flying out of London on Friday, commented about Ryanair on X (formerly Twitter): 'Worse 
experience for people, long queue at airports, [and] polluting planet for money.'
The new fee makes a mockery of a £55 fine the budget firm imposes on passengers to print out their boarding pass 
at the airport if they don't check-in online.
Italian traveller Marcello Maggio said: 'Ryanair says I must check in online, but it doesn't give me the boarding pass 
online to force me to pay for a seat. What am I buying with the ticket if not a seat to fly?'
Other add-ons for those who book online include £4 to £15 to reserve a seat, while bags cost between £20 and 
£60, with an excess fee of around £10 per kilo. 
If a passenger requires oxygen for medical reasons they are not allowed to bring their own - and must pay £55 to 
use Ryanair's. 
The latest fee does not appear to affect all travellers, with some saying they got a digital boarding pass for free.
A Ryanair spokesman said: 'Passengers have the choice of choosing a seat for a small fee or be randomly 
allocated a seat free of charge.' 
The firm did not respond to claims that it was effectively forcing customers to pay for a digital boarding pass.

Tartan barmy: Air prices rise 600%

THE Tartan Army will need more Euros for Euro 2024 as air fares jumped 600% - even before fans know where 
they are going.
Qualifying for the first foreign tournament in a quarter of a century has seen prices go through the roof for 
supporters desperate to follow Steve Clarke's men to Germany next summer.
It's thought up to 25,000 Tartan Army footsoldiers will cross the North Sea for the first mass gathering on the 
continent since the World Cup in France in 1998.
The draw to determine who and where Scotland play won't be made until this evening in Hamburg, yet airlines have 
already responded to surging Scottish demand by sending air fares sky-high.
For example, German carrier Lufthansa is charging £410 for a one-way ticket from Glasgow to Frankfurt on June 
13, the day before the tournament begins.
Wily Scotland fans who anticipated that their team would qualify booked the same flight last September - for £98.
Ryanair are charging £342 for a seat on the Edinburgh to
Dusseldorf flight the same day. That is 600% up on the price the week before, just £47.
The same can be seen with hotel prices, up in some cases by 300% for middle-ranking establishments. In Berlin, a 
night's stay at the three-star Amano Grand Central, Mitte, will cost 302 Euros (£260) on June 15, the day the capital 
hosts its first group game.
The next night, the price falls to 92 Euros (£80).
Legendary Tartan Army footsoldier John Low, 77, awarded a SFA honour for attending 100 Scotland internationals, 
said: "These companies are profiting from the desire to see Scotland play."
Tartan barmy: Air prices rise 600%
A spokesman for Lufthansa said: "Our prices are largely determined by supply and demand."
Ryanair has been approached for comment.

Waterford Airport to receive multimillion-euro investment
Waterford Airport to receive multimillion-euro investment
Transportation Monitor Worldwide

Copyright 2023 Global Data Point. Provided by Syndigate Media Inc. All Rights Reserved
Length: 317 words
Body
Waterford Airport is to receive a multimillion-euro investment, seven years after the departure of its last commercial 
flight.
An announcement of a combination of public and private investment is expected on Friday, with the focus to be an 
extension to the airports runway.
It is understood that up to 20 million will be committed by private investors, with overall investment possibly topping 
30 million when public funding is added. The board of the airport is known to have begun negotiations with the 
billionaire Galway brothers Luke and Brian Comer that could see them taking a majority stake in the facility. The 
Waterford News & Star title reported earlier this month that this could amount to an 80 per cent holding.
A 150 metre extension to the airports runway, funded by the Department of Transport, was planned a decade ago 
but never came to fruition. Planning permission was granted last year for a runway extension and associated works, 
but private investment stalled.
Minister for Finance Michael McGrath is due in Waterford on Friday to make an announcement about the airports 
future.
Waterford Airport opened in 1981, with Ryanair operating its first scheduled flight four years later. In its final year of 
commercial flight operations seven years ago, the facility handled 13,511 passengers. The Irish Coast Guard Air 
and Sea Rescue helicopter is based at the airport.
Last September, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan poured cold water over the commercial future of Waterford 
Airport, pointing to the number of aviation facilities already in the southeast and noting the Government had not 
seen a detailed redevelopment proposal for the facility.
Waterford Airport to receive multimillion-euro investment
We have so many airports in the country... Knock, Shannon, Kerry, Cork, Dublin, Belfast, he told local radio station 
WLRFM at that stage.
It is not an easy commercial proposition to start getting the base that would give you a commercial service.

Highlight: "Not only do you get a view, you also don't have to face anyone else while sitting there"
Body
Passengers flying from Manchester Airport may all know about The Lion and Antelope pub, but there's also another 
bar that has less queues and a runway view that people often miss. 
Situated in Terminal 3, there's a reason why the Lion and Antelope is so popular: It's open until 3am or whenever 
the last departure is and it serves classic dishes alongside a wide array of drinks. But that also means it comes at 
the cost of long queues and lengthy waits for a table.
But one frequent traveller, who visits the Airport a number of times a year, has shared their top drinking spot in the 
terminal that they say is little-known and often has no queues.
Not far away from the Lion and Antelope lies the Nook, which Lancs Live's Federica Bedendo has revealed to be 
her new favourite place to visit whilst waiting to catch a flight.
Federica says she often flies from Terminal 3 to travel to her hometown of Venica via Ryanair so has become well 
trodden with the terminal over the years. She writes: "This means I often find myself at Terminal 3, where I'd like to 
enjoy a pint alone and in peace.
"Now, that can sometimes feel like a mission. The Lion and Antelope is the biggest bar in the terminal once you 
pass security and naively, for a long time I thought it was the only bar where you could get a draught beer -
WRONG.
"I've often found myself queuing for ages for a pint, only to then have to sit next to a tipsy couple who want to talk 
about their upcoming Canaries trip, with a stag do loudly enjoying their pre-flight drinks behind me.
The 'quiet and inviting' Manchester Airport bar with a runway view that not many people know about
"Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-social, but when I travel alone I only ever have a maximum of two drinks, so I'm 
often not at the same level of merriness as the people trying to have a chat. And at the Lion and Antelope, it's often 
the case you have to share a table because of how busy it is and limited seating space.
"You can imagine my shock when one day after enjoying my pint at that bar, I walked towards the nearby loos, only 
to see that beyond the toilet areas there was.... Another bar serving draught beer, called The Nook.
"Not only was this bar quieter, with little to no queue, but there is also a long bar-type seating area with stools 
overlooking the runway. Not only do you get a view, you also don't have to face anyone else while sitting there."
Federica said the bar also has plugs to charge your phone or laptop, as well as a handful of tables which can be 
just right for a small family. Speaking about the bar, she adds: "You can also access the bar by following directions 
for gates 49-44 and you'll see the bar on the left, just before reaching the gates.
"Quiet, inviting and serving a range of beers, wines and soft drinks, and with the free entertainment of watching the 
planes land and take-off -what's not to like.
"I was there just this past weekend, killing a bit of time before my flight. On draught they had a Brooklyn Pilsner and 
Manchester Craft lager from the J.W. Lees brewery.
"When I sat myself down on one of the stools, I just popped my headphones in and enjoyed my podcasts, while 
sipping on my beer and watching the luggage being loaded on to a departing plane. It was very relaxing.
"If like me, you'd never clocked the Nook -you're welcome. And if you had and were trying to keep this quiet, don't 
worry, I doubt the kind of people you are trying to avoid have read past the headline!"

Highlight: Michael O’Leary calls for tighter control over third-party suppliers
Body
Ryanair has become the latest airline to find “fake parts” in two of its aircraft engines amid an unfolding safety 
scandal in the United States.
The low-cost carrier confirmed that components with falsified certification documents had been discovered in two 
aircraft engines in Texas and Brazil in recent months. 
The fraudulent parts were found during scheduled maintenance checks and have been removed from the engines.
Ryanair, Europe’s largest short-haul airline, is the fourth carrier to find suspicious parts after Delta Air Lines, 
American Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
The scandal was first reported by Bloomberg in September after a Portuguese maintenance and repair company 
noticed in June that spare engine parts labelled “new” in their paperwork showed signs of wear. Since then aviation 
industry regulators have launched an investigation into AOG Technics, a London-based company that is thought to 
have sold thousands of engine parts with fake certification for Airbus and Boeing models.
The
Civil Aviation Authority
issued a warning in August advising British-based airlines to thoroughly investigate their records for any parts 
acquired directly or indirectly from AOG Technics.
Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of 
Ryanair,

 told Bloomberg that he believed the allegedly fraudulent parts found in the engines had been supplied by AOG 
Technics. He clarified that the airline did not buy components directly from AOG Technics but had done so through 
third parties. He added that the two engines remained in workshops and that the suspect parts had been sent to the 
bodies investigating AOG Technics.
O’Leary, 62, said Ryanair remained “largely unaffected” by the scandal. The airline has reported strong half-year 
profits of €2.18 billion after dealing with record summer traffic.
However, the tycoon called for tighter control over the third-party suppliers of engine parts. “Given the level of 
paperwork that already exists, I’m not quite sure how anybody was able to come up with dodgy parts,” he told 
Bloomberg.
AOG Technics is a parts buyer and seller registered at a high-end office location near London Victoria station. The 
company deleted its website and LinkedIn profile after Bloomberg’s initial report on the story in September.
Companies House shows the business was incorporated in 2015 and lists Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, 35, as the 
sole director.
AOG Technics did not respond to a request for comment.

Dublin-based Avia Solutions Group, the world's largest aircraft leasing, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) 
firm, said it generated earnings of (EURO)316m in the third quarter of the year, as revenue rose to (EURO)1.64bn.
The figures were up 31pc and 22pc respectively.
Avia, which moved its headquarters to Dublin from its home country of Lithuania earlier this year, has customers 
including Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, Wizzair, Ryanair and SAS. Avia is the parent company of SmartLynx Airlines, 
Avion Express, BBN Airlines, Klasjet and Magma Aviation.
The company is ultimately controlled by businessman Gediminas Ziemelis, the group's chairman.
Avia Solutions Group chief executive Jonas Janukenas said that the third-quarter performance was a reflection of 
the "substantial demand" for ACMI services across the world.
"The year 2023, especially the extremely active summer season, demonstrated the tremendous need for ACMI 
services in the aviation industry worldwide," he said.
Europe accounted for 69pc of revenue in the third quarter, while Asia accounted for 19pc. Its revenue in Asia rose 
just over 9pc in the period. The group now has a fleet of 197 passenger and cargo aircraft and plans to expand in 
the Asia-Pacific region. It has set up new companies in Thailand and Indonesia to underpin its development and 
aims to have a total of five operators in Asia by the end of next year. It is also expanding in South America.
"Expanding in south-east Asia and South America is a key strategic direction for the group, allowing us to balance 
the reduced seasonal demand in Europe during the winter by shifting aircraft to these regions," said Mr Janukenas. 
"During the past few years, we have become a major aviation player in this part of the world and plan further 
expansion.
Earnings jump to (EURO)316m at aircraft operator Avia
"Additionally, significant investments are being made in MRO [maintenance, repair and overhaul] infrastructure for 
the group's aviation companies providing ACMI services. The total investment in the initial development phase in 
the region amounts to (EURO)25m."
Avia Solutions has begun the construction of a 20,000 sqm aircraft maintenance hangar in the Dominican Republic 
and a 17,000 sqm aircraft maintenance hangar in Bali. The group's subsidiary, Avion Express, has established an 
ACMI airline in Brazil to serve clients in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic.
This year, Avia freed up almost (EURO)1.5bn in capital that could potentially be made available to distribute to 
shareholders.

RYANAIR has become the latest airline to be hit by an international scam after it found fake engine parts in two of 
its planes.
The parts were discovered during maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil in the past few months. They have since 
been removed.
In a growing scandal, major US carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also found 
suspect parts.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said the bogus components came from the British supplier AOG Technics, which is 
not one of his airline's approved suppliers.
Regulators have been alerted to fake parts found in Boeing and Airbus planes this year and investigators have 
traced the supplies back to AOG Technics.
Aviation watchdogs in Europe, the UK, and the US have accused the company of supplying engine parts with faked 
certification documents, raising concerns over safety. Calling for tighter control of third-party jet engine suppliers, Mr 
O'Leary told the Bloomberg financial news group: 'Given the level of paperwork that exists, I'm not quite sure how 
anybody was able to come up with dodgy parts.'
US engine-maker CFM International has taken legal action against AOG Technics after its CFM56 model - the 
world's most widely used jet engine - was affected by the scandal.
Following a review of AOG Technics documents, CFM international said thousands of engine parts may have been 
sold with forged paperwork.

Bogus components from AOG Technics were found in 145 of the 22,600 CFM56 engines in operation, according to 
reports.
More than half of the planes affected have been grounded.
The UK's aviation watchdog announced in August it was 'investigating the supply of a large number of suspect 
unapproved parts' that could be traced back to AOG Technics. The Civil Aviation Authority issued a safety notice 
warning airlines that some of the parts were used in engines fitted to British planes.
Operators and owners were told to investigate their records for parts bought directly or indirectly from AOG 
Technics.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency also said in August it was examining reports of parts with suspected 
falsified documents.

'What sort of masochist doesn't use a lever that's there specifically to lessen their discomfort?'
There is something very weird about this debate. Which is that unlike most "divisive" topics, which have pros and 
cons on either side, I cannot begin to fathom why this one is even an argument.
Seats on planes (and indeed in cars and various other modes of transport) are designed to recline because it is 
much, much more comfortable for human beings to sit for long periods of time leaning back than bolt upright. This 
fact is indisputable. The button is there for you to use it. What sort of absolute masochist, first of all, does not make 
use of a lever that is there specifically to lessen their discomfort?
But more baffling still, why should that person, not satisfied with spending hours in such a pose themselves - 
defiant, like a martyr burning at the stake - expect all his fellow passengers to choose the same fate?
The only scenario in which I can vaguely imagine being annoyed by someone in front of me reclining their seat 
would be if mine did not also recline. Even then, it would only be, presumably, because my button was broken, 
which would not be the fault of the person in front, nor even something they'd know about.
Further, in the unlikely event that such a misfortune did befall me on a long-haul flight, I would not, in a million 
years, stand up, tap this person's shoulder and demand they not use their button either; thereby doubling the 
human suffering. Happily, we rarely need to delve into this level of philosophy, given that reclinable seats all recline, 
so that as soon as the seatbelt signs go off, the domino effect can take place and everyone can claim their few 
inches of improvement. Why - if this is you - do you not want to lean?
Is it ever acceptable to recline on a plane? Two frequent flyers go head to head The innocent key to an easier 
journey, or the behaviour of a 'psychopath'? You ....
The only motive I can see for banning adjustable seats is the very one which has driven certain budget airlines to 
do just that: stinginess. Ryanair, for one, stripped out the function (along with other frills, like seatback pockets) in 
2004 because it made the chairs lighter and thus the fuel costs lower. And it doesn't make for a very comfortable 
flight, does it?
I've written about this "debate" extensively in the past and am still no closer to understanding the other side. So if 
anyone has a logically sound argument as to why I should, on my next lengthy flight, refrain from pushing that 
button, I'd like to hear it. Write in, leave a comment online. I await with bated breath.
Annabel Fenwick Elliott 'People who recline their seats on aeroplanes are psychopaths and should be banned from 
flying'
As golden rules go, the one about treating others as you would like to be treated is one of the easier ones to live by. 
If you're going on a date, don't have a cheese and onion sandwich for lunch. If you work in a small office, don't 
reheat a fish pie in the communal microwave. If you're off on holiday, don't recline your seat on the plane.
You may think: "I paid for this seat, why shouldn't I do whatever I like?" What's it to you if the person behind you has 
less leg room?
Planes are uncomfortable. For most, flying is the worst part of going on holiday; the misery of being stuffed into a 
metal can at 36,000ft is the price we begrudgingly pay for the joy of travel. Is three inches of reclined comfort so 
much to ask?
Yes. We live in a society and that means sometimes you have to cope with minor discomfort for the good of those 
around you. And let's not pretend that keeping your seat upright is more than a minor discomfort. You do it for 
seven hours a day at work, you can manage it on a short-haul flight.
Chances are, immediately after your flight, you'll be checking into a comfortable hotel room where you can laze and 
lounge to your heart's desire. You won't have to inflict yourself on anyone else while you do it.
Allow me to remind you of a basic fact of life which some entitled air passengers seem to have forgotten: you are no 
more important than anyone else. You do not have a God-given right to comfort at their expense.
The benefit you get from reclining is, frankly, miniscule. It isn't going to make the seat less hard, it isn't going to 
improve the taste of your in-flight meal, it isn't going to make the feet of the guy beside you stink any less.
What it will accomplish is to give even less room to the person behind you, make it harder to watch their film or eat 
their meal, and set their holiday off to a bad start.
Some small discomfort is the price of having cheap airfares and being able to travel. If you don't like it, pay for the 
upgrade to first class or better yet, hire a private jet where you can do literally anything you want. If these are 
impossible and you truly can't handle a few hours of sitting up straight, perhaps you're simply not suited to travel. 
Might I recommend staying at home in your armchair and moaning about your misanthropy on social media 
instead?

Highlight: Safety concerns have been raised, with aviation watchdogs in the UK, Europe and the US accusing the 
company of offering engine parts with faked certification documents
Body
Two Ryanair planes have been identified as having fake engine parts, with the company becoming the latest in a 
series of international airlines to be hit by the scandal, it has been reported.
Over the past few months, the parts have been identified during maintenance checks in Brazil and Texas. 
Additionally, the prominent US carriers Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were also found to 
have faulty parts in their planes.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the fake components are from British supplier AOG Technics, which 
is not one of Ryanair's approved suppliers, MailOnline reports. This year regulators were alerted to the faulty parts 
identified in Boeing and Airbus planes, and reportedly the supplies have been traced back to AOG Technics.
Airline parts are supposed to undergo strict safety tests to ensure they are deemed 'airworthy', with each part meant 
to come with a certificate that can be used to trace the part's origins and inspection records.
But safety concerns have been raised, with aviation watchdogs in the UK, Europe and the US accusing the 
company of offering engine parts with faked certification documents.
Mr O'Leary asked for stricter control of third-party jet engine suppliers, and legal action against AOG Technics has 
been initiated after its CFM56 model, which holds the record for most engines ever sold to airlines at almost 34,000, 
was supposedly impacted by the scandal. The Civil Aviation Authority is Britain's watchdog and it has issued a 
Ryanair finds fake engine parts in two planes as bogus parts scandal continues
safety notice to airlines, saying it was "investigating the supply of a large number of suspect unapproved parts" that 
could, it said, be traced to AOG Technics.
In August, the EU Aviation Safety Agency said it was looking at reports of parts with supposed falsified documents, 
whereas the US Federal Aviation Administration has cautioned airlines about the scandal. A probe is being 
undertaken by the US Justice Department, but it remains in the early stages.
In October, big airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines had jets pulled from their 
fleets due to investigations into similarly potentially catastrophic faults. 
The Mirror contacted Ryanair for a comment. At the time of publishing AOG Technics website had been taken 
down.

RYANAIR has found "fake parts" in two of its aircraft engines during maintenance checks, becoming the latest 
airline to be affected by a brewing scandal.
The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been 
removed from the engines, the low-cost carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary told Bloomberg News.
The global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators scrambling to 
assess engines and trace equipment.
Aviation regulators have accused an obscure London company, AOG Technics, of supplying thousands of engine 
parts with faked certification documents for Airbus and Boeing models, including older-generation 737s used by 
Ryanair.
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are among the carriers reportedly that found suspect 
parts. The Civil Aviation Authority said in August that it has been investigating the supply of a "large number of 
suspect unapproved parts" through AOG Technics.
Mr O'Leary said the Irish airline has never conducted business directly with AOG, receiving the component for two 
engines instead via third parties. He added that the carrier remains "largely unaffected" by the scandal.
Airlines were told to check their stocks of spare engine parts after reports around AOG started circulating earlier this 
year, according to Mr O'Leary. The discovery of so-called fake parts comes after Ryanair was forced to make 
changes to its winter schedule after Boeing delayed aircraft deliveries.

The setback prompted Mr O'Leary to say he could scrap future orders if the US aviation giant continued to miss 
delivery targets.
In October, he said: "It is frustrating because the demand for travel is very strong and we think there are a lot of 
competitors who are going to be grounding their aircraft."
AOG Technics has been accused by US engine giant General Electric and its French business partner Safran of 
large-scale fraud that they allege has led to fake or old parts being wrongly installed into more than 100 engines.
AOG's founder and owner Jose Zamora Yrala is fighting the allegations.

Hello from Budapest, the capital of Hungary.
I've been coming here since the wonder days, by that I mean the '90s, when Hungary had just thrown off 
communism and came in from the cold. Believe me, that was the best time to visit this fascinating city.
It was in 2003, while I was living in Moscow, I took my dad to Budapest for a trip. I told him I'd fallen in love with this 
city and wanted to buy a flat there. I managed to do just that in 2007.
Wow, was it really 16 years ago? Goodness me.
I sold up in 2013, and have returned since, but not for six years.
These days I'm done with heading off to war zones for months at a time, yet I'm still due a holiday now and again. 
So, why not make it a working holiday and write about it?
The only trip I've done in the last seven months was to drive to Brussels and back to collect our cat Pinkie, and that 
was four days of motorway driving with a stressed cat - so not much fun.
Don't worry, I didn't leave the cat to her own devices in Aberdeen - Lina is back from Russia, so Pinkie is well taken 
care of.
I've finally settled down, with a house, a cat and girlfriend. Regrets? None whatsoever. I'm very happy actually. That 
said, a few weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that it was time to do something… just for me.
BACK TO AN OLD LOVE DISPATCHES
I'm out of practice with this travelling malarky. I mean, I used to spend around eight months of each year on the 
road, with huge amounts of time in airports. It didn't bother me, in fact I enjoyed airports as it meant I was off on 
another adventure. But now that's all over, I find myself really focusing on the actual airport and then the flight itself. 
And both were awful, too busy and too noisy.
As for airports, monumental rip-offs. Just a means to an end, that's all. I take no pleasure in being in them anymore.
As for the flight, it may have been KLM via Amsterdam, but it seems all flights are no-frills now.
I remember you used to get a full cooked breakfast on the BA flight from Aberdeen to London - long gone now. 
These days, you can pay for a freezing cold sandwich. Ryanair basically. At least I got a free coffee on KLM.
In Budapest, I took a taxi from the airport to my rented apartment. I must be getting old, I used to take the bus.
It was rush hour, and I've never seen it so busy. I've driven a lot here over the years and would not like to have 
done that now.
As I looked out of the car window, I spotted old monuments, landmarks, that back in the day were out of town and 
basically on their own. Now, they are surrounded by giant western shopping malls, McDonald's and Burger King 
and Aldis everywhere.
I arrived at my lovely apartment in the north of the city away from the centre, and with no time to lose, I dumped my 
bags and headed out. Would it still be there, I wondered?
I walked on to Andrassy Avenue, past the Opera House and up towards Heroes' Square. And yes, there it was. 
Café Kara.
I sat outside in the cold evening air and ordered a beer, which I drank overlooking Heroes' Square (see photo).
I felt a rush of nostalgia: this city holds so many personal memories for me.
I sat, drank said beer, and let those memories all wash over me.
The next day I was up and out the door by 8am. I headed south, crossed the Danube, climbed a hill and took this 
stunning photo (above) looking down over the city.
Later, back at ground level, in the streets surrounding the very centre, this is where it's all changed so much.
I noticed loads of especially Asian takeaways. Budapest never had those when I lived here.
Also lots of foreign workers on bikes riding around delivering fast food. And, annoyingly, kids on e-scooters, darting 
around; dangerous things, should be banned.
Other things they didn't have when I lived here include - recycling bins, paying for anything and everything with 
contactless, and wifi. I didn't have wifi in my apartment back then, I used to go to a coffee shop to go online. How 
the world has changed in 15 years.
The centre, I'm afraid, does have a lot of tacky tourist shops, while the top street in the capital, Andrassy Avenue, 
now boasts shops such as Apple, Omega watches and a plethora of other such high-end establishments.
It's the same the world over - a one-sizefits-all high street. To be fair, it slowly started to creep in here as I left 10 
years ago. By that I mean globalisation and mass tourism. Not my favourite combination.
But the globalisation genie is out of the bottle, and as much as I would like to shove him back in, he ain't going.
To sum up, the buildings of Budapest may well still be Hungarian, but the shops and products are no longer 
Hungarian. And the signs outside most shops or cafés are not in Hungarian anymore, but English.
BACK TO AN OLD LOVE DISPATCHES
However, just a few streets north of the centre, where the tourists rarely venture, it still thankfully feels Hungarian.
Therefore, despite the fact "everything" has changed in this city, at the same time as I walk around streets I know 
like the back of my hand, it seems as nothing has changed. Does that make sense?
Walking in no particular direction and with no plan, at around 11am, I found myself one block away from Akacfa 
Street. This is where I used to live. I simply had to go.
With sheer luck, the apartment's main door to the street was open, so in I sneaked. Up the old-fashioned spiral 
staircase and right out on to the old wrought iron veranda that ran past my flat.
What a surreal feeling. From the very day I moved in, I made friends with the elderly Hungarian lady who lived in 
the far corner of my landing.
She took me into her heart, invited me to call her Mama, and treated me like a grandson.
She cried when I left in 2013, but I returned to see her twice. Sadly, mama died just before her 90th birthday a few 
years ago.
As I stood there, I looked over at where she used to sit outside her front door.
She'd often walk over and bring me cooked food, and when I'd built up the courage,
I cooked her a goulash and brought it to her. Either a brave or foolish thing to do -after all, she'd been making that 
dish all her life - but, much to my relief, it seemed to pass muster.
On writing this column, I found on my laptop the last photograph taken of Mama and myself, you see it here.
She was wonderful. I miss her. As I stood and gazed at my flat, it looked the same as always. My mind drifted 
inside and to the numerous family and friends that visited me here but have since passed. My Russian "mum and 
dad", Vladimir and Tamara, and, of course, my own dad.
It was very quiet. I stood for a few more minutes, then left.
Later that evening, I was sitting outside a street café with a glass of Hungarian red. As I supped, I felt a huge mix of 
emotions. Kind of numb, but not in a bad way.
Maybe I shouldn't have gone to my old flat. But I'm glad I did. I wanted to see it again. Not the actual property, for 
that's just bricks and mortar. I wanted to try to get a feel for the people who'd shared that part of my life.
I feel, though, as if I've broken a golden rule. "Don't look back, you're not going that way." A very powerful statement 
indeed.
Yet I'll console myself with another powerful statement, one I read out at my dear friend John's funeral.
"Don't be sad it's over… be grateful it happened."

Body
Adverse weather has led to delays and cancellations at Manchester Airport this morning December 2.
With a yellow weather warning in place across much of the north of England, there have been 38 flights delayed by 
half an hour or more, and two flights have been cancelled. The warning is in place for snow and ice.
But much of continental Europe is also blanketed in snow, including Germany - which is where the two cancelled 
flights were bound for. Both the 7:15am and 10:55am Lufthansa services to Munich have been cancelled, as 
Bavaria is set to receive between 15cm and 25cm of snowfall today.
One notable grounded flight is Manchester United's private plane to Newcastle as the Red Devils take on the Toon 
in the north-east at 8pm tonight. It's thought the squad will now drive to the game.
However, some flights have simply been delayed by the bad weather, and most services are running to time, 
according to Flight Radar 24. This is a list of every cancelled and delayed flight on Saturday morning December 2.
This list will be updated throughout the day.

Edinburgh Airport expected ‘to be put up for sale by Christmas’
Edinburgh Airport expected ‘to be put up for sale by Christmas’

Highlight: Edinburgh Airport said to be valued at more than £2 billion
Body
Aviation sources have said that Edinburgh Airport is expected to be put up for sale “before Christmas”.
Strengthening rumours about the expected move by owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) came as the 
Reuters news agency reported on Friday the company was working on a sale of its majority stake.
Scotland’s busiest airport could be valued at more than £2.15 billion (€2.5bn) and sold as early as next year, 
according to unnamed sources quoted by Reuters.
New York-based fund managers GIP bought the airport in 2012 for £807 million in an auction forced on owner BAA, 
which also owned Glasgow Airport, by the Competition Commission. It sold a 50 per cent stake in Gatwick, Britain’s 
second busiest airport after Heathrow, four years ago.
The latest speculation follows reports in October last year of a possible £3bn sale of Edinburgh.
The aviation source told our sister paper The Scotsman: “We keep hearing rumours that the sale process is going 
to get underway imminently. As I understand it, the formal process will be starting before Christmas.
"The rumours are so strong and grounded. There is no smoke without fire. It seems to be the worst kept secret in 
the industry.”
Sources also told Reuters the owners of AGS Airports, which runs Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, 
may also sell. It follows Ferrovial, one of the owners, selling its 25 per cent stake in Heathrow Airport as the largest 
shareholder in a £2.37bn deal on Wednesday.
The company and Australian partners Macquarie bought what became AGS from its ownership by Heathrow in 
2014 for more then £1bn.
Edinburgh Airport expected ‘to be put up for sale by Christmas’
The potential Edinburgh Airport sale comes after passenger numbers rebounded to near pre-Covid levels in the first 
half of this year. In an update published in September, the airport reported a “continued strong recovery” from the 
pandemic with 6.6 million passengers in the six months to the end of June – 93 per cent of 2019 levels. It reported 
revenue up 15 per cent on the same period in 2019 to £115m.
The airport, which employs some 750 staff with a further 7,000 working for other companies on the site, said: “The 
recovery has been led by international markets with a strong rebound in both outbound and inbound travel.”
This has included Ryanair and Easyjet, the airport’s biggest airlines, basing more aircraft there with new routes, 
while Scotland’s only flights to China resumed this summer.
Other new routes include WestJet flying to Calgary in Canada, Delta resuming Atlanta flights and JetBlue launching 
New York flights next May, joining two other airlines on the route.
Postponed Edinburgh Airport runway resurfacing 'has increased risk of emergency repairs’ because of ‘significant 
patching’
The airport said it was spending £40m on improvements this year, including new security scanners, which will relax 
the 100mL hand baggage liquids limit from next June, in line with the UK Government deadline.
However, the airport has been plagued by chronic baggage problems this year caused by a shortage of staff at 
airline handling agents Swissport and Menzies Aviation and luggage delays at hub airports elsewhere.
GIP declined to comment, but AGS dismissed the reports as “simply speculation”.

Boeing Excluded From US Air Force's 'Doomsday Plane' Project, Spotlight 
On Sierra Nevada For SAOC Contract

Boeing Company(NYSE:BA) has been reportedly excluded from the U.S. Air Force's competition to develop the 
successor to the E-4B Nightwatch, often referred to as the "Doomsday Plane"for its nuclear war resilience.
This development, confirmed by Boeing on Friday, significantly alters the dynamics of the contest to build the 
aircraft's next version, according to a news report by Reuters.
This decision positions the privately-held defense contractor Sierra Nevada Corp as the only publicly known 
contender for the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) contract.

This contract aims to replace a fleet that has been operational since the 1970s, the report read.
The Air Force, targeting a 2024 award date for the SAOC contract, has refrained from commenting on whether 
there were other bidders besides Sierra Nevada Corp.
"We cannot discuss an active source selection and detailed program information is classified," an Air Force 
spokesperson told Reuters.
According to two sources familiar with the matter, Boeing, the current manufacturer of the E-4B, and the Air Force 
could not reach an agreement on data rights and contract terms, according to the outlet.
The sources revealed that Boeing was unwilling to commit to a fixed-price contract that would require the company 
to cover costs exceeding a predetermined limit, it added.

"We are approaching all new contract opportunities with added discipline to ensure we can meet our commitments 
and support the long-term health of our business," Boeing said in a statement to Reuters.
"We remain confident our SAOC approach is the most comprehensive, technically mature and lowest-risk solution 
for the customer and Boeing."
Boeing's defense unit has lost $1.3 billion this year on fixed-price development programs that include NASA's 
Starliner and the next Air Force One, the reportadded.
It has lost $16.3 billion on fixed-price programs since 2014, according to a Reuters review of Boeing's regulatory 
filings.
The Air Force currently operates a fleet of four E-4B aircraft, with at least one always on alert.These highly-modified 
Boeing 747-200 jumbo jets, dating back to the 1970s, are becoming increasingly challenging and costly to maintain 
due to the obsolescence of parts.
The E-4B fleet is anticipated to reach the end of its service life in the early 2030s.
Price Action:BA shares closed higher by 0.97% to $233.87 on Friday. Shares gained 0.42% to $234.86 after hours.

As Advent calendar doors are eagerly opened, it can be easy to forget how dull January can be. Yet, thanks to wet 
weather, long nights, and the seemingly endless eking out of December pay packets, the jolly season can quickly 
unfold into a month of melancholy.
The good news is, the start of the year is a great value time to get away, as travel providers sell getaways for a 
song and flights can be snapped up for as little as £30 to some of the UK's favourite holiday destinations.
These are some of the most costeffective destinations to book now for a New Year's pick-you-up… Portugal Earlier 
this year, Post Office Travel Money ranked Lisbon and the Algarve as two of the best-value holiday destinations in 
Europe and the pocketfriendliness
of both continues into 2024. Flights to the Portuguese capital can be snapped up from £38 return with Ryanair in 
January and hotel rooms are readily available for less than £100 a night, including Mama Shelter Lisbon, where 
doubles start at £78.
In the Algarve, return flights start at £35 to Faro in early January. You'll need to pack a jumper or two, and perhaps 
a coat and some sturdy shoes, but at this time of year, you could happily stride off on the Rota Vicentina's network 
of hiking trails that embroider the region's quiet west coast into rural Alentejo. Accommodation at guesthouses and 
rural hotels costs as little as Euro 60 (£52)
a night at properties such as Cercas Velhas in Vila do Bispo (rotavicentina. com). UTracks offers a seven-night 
group walking tour from Porto Covo to Odeceixe, taking in fishing villages and untamed beaches, from £595pp, 
departing 6 January.
For a bit more luxury, a week at
New Year escapes
the five-star Pine Cliffs Resort near Albufeira, with its clifftop golf course and spa, costs from £548pp with British 
Airways Holidays in January, including flights from Gatwick.
A week at Hotel Vasco da Gama, in beachside Monte Gordo, close to the Spanish border, is priced from £359pp 
with Jet2holidays, based on a 14 January departure from Manchester. Albania Online travel company Opodo 
reports that bookings to the capital of Tirana have grown by 78 per cent in the past year and with Tim Hentschel, 
the CEO of HotelPlanner.com, earmarking the city as one of the most affordable places to take a break in January, 
it looks set to remain a hot ticket.
Highlights of a visit include cable car rides into the Dajti Mountains that skirt the city, taking in views of forests, 
farms and bunkers on the ascent, strolls
around the 230-hectare city centre Grand Park, and visits to Bunk'Art museum to discover what city life was like in 
the Communist era.
Visitors with a little more time on their hands can also take day trips to lesser-known places such as Durrës, one of 
the world's oldest cities, with about 2,500 years of recorded history, and Berat, where the Unesco-listed centre is 
speckled with Ottoman architecture.
In the south-east, there is also good value skiing and boarding in the small resort of Ski Pista Bigëll (facebook.com/ 
SkiPistaBigell).
Stays at five-star hotels in Tirana such as the Mak Albania start at £95 a night, and you can dip into the capital's 
inviting markets, such as the old town's New Bazaar to warm up in the bars, cafés and restaurants (pazariiri.com). 
Morocco Travel search engine Kayak has named Marrakech as one of the 10 most affordable places to fly to in 
January, but it is not the only place in Morocco where you will find good value. On the west coast, in the seaside 
resort of Taghazout, a seven-night stay at the Timoulay Hotel costs from
Continued from p73
£635pp with TUI, with flights departing from Glasgow on 23 January.
Half-an-hour north of busy Agadir, Taghazout, is a popular surfing destination, but if the average January daytime 
temperature of 20°C isn't enough to tempt you into the water, there is still plenty to do.
Day trips can be taken into the Sahara Desert, to Paradise Valley - an oasis-like valley on the Tamraght River - and 
the town of Tiznit, with its ancient walls and Berber jewellery souk.
For something a little different, The Adventure People is offering an eight-day touring holiday from Casablanca to 
Marrakech, which includes time in Fes, with its leather tannery, and the Road of 1000 Kasbahs, which is lined with 
forts, from £412 excluding flights, in January. Turkey With the pound remaining strong against the Turkish lira, 
Turkey is an obvious choice for bargain-hunting holidaymakers in the new year.
Average daytime temperatures settle around 15°C on the popular south-west coast in January which, while not that 
conducive to sunbathing, makes it more comfortable to explore destinations such as Göcek and Kemer.
Located between the tourist hubs of Fethiye and Marmaris, Göcek is a pretty harbour town that's backed by forests 
and scalloped with coves, while a series of walking and biking trails squiggle their way around the resort, passing 
through olive groves and ocean lookout points as they go. A seven-night all-inclusive stay at the Rixos Premium 
Göcek costs from £571pp in January.
An hour's drive south of Antalya, the marina town of Kemer is hemmed in by the Taurus Mountains and visitors can 
get up into the peaks using the Olympos Cable Car, which ascends to 1,900m. Visits to the ancient Lycian city of 
Myra are also an option.
New Year escapes
A 15-day stay at the Alinda Hotel in Kemer costs from £1,199pp with Just Go! Holidays or, for those who want to 
get away for longer, four weeks' all-inclusive at the same hotel starts at £1,749pp, including flights from Gatwick, 
Luton
or Manchester, departing 7 January. Malta Malta may be just 17 miles long and nine miles wide, but the island 
crams in the sights, and January, with typical daytime temperatures of 16°C, is an ideal time to tour them.
Work your way through the traditional stopping points of Valletta, Mdina and Sliema, before moving
on to visit Birgu, the island's former capital, the marina town of Bormla, and Senglea, where the Gardjola Gardens 
serve up views over the Grand Harbour.
Pack your walking boots, and you can hike the Dingli Cliffs on the south side of the island. Rising 253m above the 
sea, they provide the highest point in Malta and one of the best places to catch the sunset, which takes place 
around 5pm in January.
While deals are available all over this Mediterranean island this January, Qawra is looking like the nucleus of low-
cost breaks. Located on the north-east coast, an hour's drive from Valletta, Qawra is boxed in by the sea on three 
sides, giving visitors easy access to rocky beaches and waterside promenades lined with cafés and restaurants that 
open year-round.
Thomas Cook is offering seven nights at the four-star Ax Odycy from just £195pp including flights, departing 26 
January.
Cyprus Promising average daily temperatures of between 14°C and 18°C, January is a prime time for exploring 
Cyprus beyond the beaches. Away from the stifling heat that can keep some holidaymakers sun lounger-bound in 
summer, visitors can discover the island's historical sites, mountain villages and walking trails in comfort.
From the hill town of Platres, an hour's drive inland from Paphos, are walking routes that feel their way around the 
Troodos Mountains to sights such as the Caledonia Waterfalls - a cluster of 12m-high vertical falls - and the 
Unesco-listed Lampadistis Monastery.
A seven-night stay at the Petit Palais Platres Boutique Hotel costs from £565pp with Olympic Holidays, including 
flights from Luton, in
early January. Tunisia Holidays to Tunisia's north-east coast are a steal in January. Averaging at
around 16°C, coastal temperatures are ideal for getting out and about. The fascinating capital Tunis has been 
ranked as having one of the world's lowest costs of living by the Economist Intelligence Unit this week.
From beach resorts such as Sousse, Port El Kantaoui and Hammamet, it's easy to visit historical sites such as the 
ruins of Carthage, the amphitheatre of El Jem - North Africa's answer to Rome's Colosseum - and the Unescolisted 
city of Kairouan, as well as the village of Sidi Bou Said, with its white-domed buildings and blue shuttered windows.
EasyJet Holidays is offering a week's half board at the Iberostar Selection Diar El Andalous in Sousse from £357pp, 
departing Luton on 27 January.
First Choice has a week's half-board at the Phenecia Hotel in Hammamet from £292pp, with Birmingham flights on 
19 January.
Ras Al Khaimah, UAE The United Arab Emirates might not be an obvious choice for a budget-friendly holiday, but 
come January, there are bargains to be had in Ras Al Khaimah.
The most northerly of the seven emirates, it tempts visitors with desert dune adventures, honey-coloured beaches, 
adrenaline activities that include the world's longest zipline, and temperatures that settle around 25°C in January.
New Year escapes
Located on the west coast, the man-made archipelago of Al Marjan Island is one of Ras Al Khaimah's fastest-
growing holiday destinations. It has 4.8 miles of sandy beaches, a palmlined corniche and easy access to the 
emirate's top adventure spots.
With loveholidays, seven nights at the Mövenpick Resort on Al Marjan Island start at £771pp in January, including 
flights from Heathrow.
Seven-night stays at the Hampton by Hilton Marjan Island are available from £763pp including flights from Stansted 
with On The Beach.
Thailand
Long-haul holiday specialists Flight Centre has revealed that Thailand is one of the most popular destinations 
among Britons looking for a January escape. Justin Penny, head of aviation at Flight Centre, told i: "With the British 
pound strong against the Thai baht, spending money goes further and luxury experiences such as guided tours and 
fine dining can be enjoyed at a lower price than more expensive winter-sun hot spots."
Phuket is one of its most popular islands. Eight nights at the Sunprime Kamala Beach Phuket on the west coast 
start at £899pp in January, including flights from London. Two hours north in quieter Khao Lak, a week at the five-
star Outrigger Khao Lak Beach Resort starts at £999pp with flights.
Those looking for an alternative to the busy southern holiday destinations should consider heading to the beach 
resorts that hug the Gulf of Thailand.
Three hours' drive south from Bangkok, Hua Hin is all white beaches, lively markets, and opportunities to visit 
temples. Around 15 minutes south of Hua Hin's five-star resorts, Pak Nam Pran is a historic fishing village at the 
mouth of the Pran river, with secluded bays and forest to explore.
A short walk from the beach, the Wyndham Hua Hin Pranburi Resort and Villas has doubles from as little as £67 
B&B in early January.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
November 27, 2023: 30,000 penalty points for Galway license plate holders last year
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

institutions that have made significant contributions on advancing environmental issues, by helping Japanese 
businesses create corporate value through business strategies that incorporate environmental considerations. The

standardized data available to investors - and improving market transparency.
A longtime advocate for improving the quality and usefulness of corporate sustainability disclosures, Bloomberg is a 
trusted and reliable source for environmental, social & governance (ESG) data. Bloomberg offers ESG data with 
10+ years of history for more than 11,700 companies in 102 countries, in addition to its proprietary Gender Equality 
Index (GEI) and its quant-driven ESG scores launched in 2020. Moreover, Michael R. Bloomberg is the Chair of the

"We are delighted to receive the coveted Gold Award having just received the Bronze Award in this category last 
year," said Norman Tweeboom, Head of Japan at Bloomberg. "It speaks to our recent efforts to accelerate the 
development of our ESG solutions to help investors create alpha with impact. ESG is a particularly important focus 
for the investment community in forward-looking Japan, the country with the highest number of TCFD-supporting 
companies in the world.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
November 26, 2023: Galway Bay FM PwC to provide new state of the art Media Suite to Platform94
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

Many Gaeltacht schools are being left in the "ha'penny place" over how funding is distributed.
That's according to Galway West TD Mairead Farrell, who has raised the issue in the Dail.
She said voluntary schools get a bilingual grant per student - but ETB schools don't get the same grant, despite the 
fact most Gaeltacht schools are ETB schools.
Speaking in the Dail, Sinn Fein Deputy Farrell said it should be a simple issue to address.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
November 27, 2023: Galway Bay FM Mairead Farrell says Gaeltacht schools being left in the "ha'penny place"
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

"We're heading into our busiest season, so there will be no rest for me until January," joked our server while we 
enjoyed dinner at InterContinental Vienna, which overlooks the city's Stadtpark.
Though the crowds of festive holidaymakers had already begun to make their way to the sparkling lights of Vienna's 
many Christmas markets when we visited in mid-November, the Austrian capital is set to become even busier as 
December hits.
When planning a Christmas market holiday, though Krakow, Prague or Bruges might immediately spring to mind, 
recent research has named Vienna as the number one Christmas market destination for holidaymakers in winter 
2023, surpassing the likes of Paris and London. Based on search data gathered by Mega Dice, there are over 
45,000 hashtags about the Christmas markets in Vienna, which ranks the city above the likes of London, Paris, 
Berlin and Prague.
And even though the first winter snow had not yet fallen, our trip to the metropolis pushed us headfirst into the 
festive spirit.
Getting to Vienna
Vienna is just a short flight from the UK, taking an average of two hours and 15 minutes from most London airports, 
two hours and 25 minutes from Manchester and two hours and 40 minutes from Vienna. You can fly to the Austrian 
Vienna travel guide: A weekend at Europe's 'best' Christmas market destination
capital direct from the UK with a few airlines, including Ryanair, Wizz Air, Austrian Airlines, British Airways and Jet2, 
depending on which departure airport you choose.
If you are planning on visiting Vienna for a Christmas holiday, there are some great deals available on flights and 
even city break package holidays right now.
At the time of writing, you can jet off from Leeds Bradford Airport on a direct flight to Vienna with Jet2 for just £47 
per person on December 18, 2023. Or, if you're after a package holiday, Jet2CityBreaks has a selection of deals 
which include stays in hotels just a stone's throw from some of Vienna's markets, as well as flights and luggage.
On our visit, we flew direct from London Heathrow with Austrian Air, and despite a rocky year for the travel industry 
littered with cancellations and delays, our journey went off without a hitch. Some of the best prices on flights with 
Austrian Air are available when you book in advance, but even at the time of writing, the flag-bearing airline has 
seats available from £150 in December.
Staying in Vienna
Home to over 400 hotels, there is plenty of choice when planning your trip to Vienna, whether you're choosing your 
stay based on location, price, amenities or vibe.
We checked into the near enough brand new Hotel Indigo Naschmarkt, which first opened its doors in 2023. This 
chic, modern escape is discreetly tucked back from the urban hustle and bustle, and you might not even realise it is 
there at first glance.
However, set behind a contemporary, angular facade, is a stylish, greenery-filled retreat that provides a quiet, 
boutique stay. The hotel is part of the IHG Hotels & Resorts family and offers four levels of room type, some of 
which, including the one we stayed in, come with your own outdoor courtyard seating area. 
Certain rooms at Hotel Indigo Naschmarkt come with their own private balcony or terrace 
The design, like most Hotel Indigo locations around the world, is done so with unique nods to the local area that it 
calls home. The hotel layout, with rooms surrounding a courtyard, is reminiscent of traditional apartments in the 
Viennese city.
Inside, Hotel Indigo gives subtle nods to Vienna straw furniture, a type of weave with an octagonal pattern often 
found in bistros. There's a lampshade in the bedroom, the woven hanging chairs on the terrace and you can even 
see the delicate pattern woven into the hallway carpets.
There's a trendy, luxe lobby bar, providing the perfect solace to enjoy an aperitif or nightcap, and downstairs, Hotel 
Indigo's restaurant is an explosion of greenery. Take a seat among the variety of plants and enjoy brunch or dinner.
A stay here is perfect for those seeking a hip, boutique experience, with average prices starting at approximately 
£130 per night. You can learn more about a stay at Hotel Indigo Naschmarkt in our full review here.
Alternatively, if you want to splurge on a stay that has a little of that classic hotel glamour, and is also even closer to 
some of Vienna's main Christmas markets, a stay at IHG Hotels & Resorts InterContinental Wien could be more 
your speed.
The 1960s hotel is tucked in a vast, concrete building that really doesn't match the old-world ritz inside. You can 
expect sparkling chandeliers at every turn, a grand carpeted staircase and staff dressed in traditional, white, luxury 
uniforms. 
You'll be greeted at InterContinental Vienna by a vast, sparkling chandelier - with even more inside 
One of the most eye-catching features of the huge lobby is an American-style bar, set beneath a draping of 
quadrangle crystals.
Vienna travel guide: A weekend at Europe's 'best' Christmas market destination
When it was first built in 1964, the 39-metre-tall complex was an icon of the jet-set golden years of travel. Though it 
holds on to many of its traditional accents, InterContinental has also integrated modern amenities, including the 
Parlor restaurant serving up a "Taste of Lebanon" by chef Khaled Akoum.
The restaurant is just a taste of the rich and diverse selection of global cuisines on offer in the Austrian capital. The 
hotel has previously been a refuge for guests including David Beckham. A stay at InterContiental can be booked for 
an average of £200 per night.
However, if you are looking for a simple, purse-friendly stay, IHG Hotels & Resorts Holiday Inn Vienna City can be 
booked for an average of £107 a night.
The hotel won a TripAdvisor Travellers' Choice Award this year, and though it's not slap bang in the heart of the 
city, main attractions can be reached in around 15 to 20 minutes on foot.
Vienna's Christmas Markets
Vienna lights up as the festive season begins, with over 20 official Advent markets dotted across the ornate city.
While there are plenty to choose from, perhaps the most famous is the Viennese Christmas Market on City Hall 
Square, Christkindlmarkt am Rathausplatz, which welcomes guests through its tall, sparkling gateway to explore an 
array of quaint stalls filled with festive goodies and seasonal treats.
Pop on your ice skates and glide around the illuminated City Hall Park or wander past the illuminated tree of hearts. 
For little ones, there's a 12-meter-high multi-level carousel that twinkles as it turns and looks particularly enchanting 
against the blanket of nightfall.
We stopped to pick up Spritzgebäck, a traditional Viennese finger biscuit where each end is dipped in creamy 
chocolate, with a tangy orange centre sandwiched between the shortbread fingers.
City Hall Square's Christmas market has an ice rink surrounded by sparkling lights 
Another favourite from the trip was the Christmas Village Belvedere Palace, where the Christmas lights twinkle in 
front of the stunning Baroque palace.
The market here is known for its food offering, with plenty of Austrian options including sausages and potato 
rounds. The market overlooks a large lake decorated with glistening star lights, where the palace can be seen 
reflected in the glassy waters below. Once you've finished up your mulled wine, why not walk off the treats in the 
stunning palace gardens?
As well as the larger markets, there are also a few smaller ones dotted across the city, including
You can see a full list of all of Vienna's Christmas markets and their opening times on the official Austria website.
The Christmas lights at Belvedere Palace are beautiful 
What to do in Vienna
Of course, you can spend a weekend trip visiting all of Vienna's Christmas markets, but there is so much to do 
beyond Vienna's Christmas markets. Some of our favourite hours were spent simply ambling the streets of the city, 
taking in the stunning Baroque architecture and stumbling on hidden cobbled courtyards.
Art lovers and those with a keen eye for 20th-century design should pay a visit to Hundertwasser House on the 
corner of Kegelgasse and Löwengasse.
There are hardly any straight lines to be found in this colourful, modernist residential complex by artist 
Friedensreich Hundertwasser which was built between 1983 and 1985. The building can only be viewed from the 
Vienna travel guide: A weekend at Europe's 'best' Christmas market destination
outside, but right opposite is the Hundertwasser Village, which is open to visitors. The artist created his own 
shopping centre with a "village square", a bar and stores in his style.
Hundertwasser House is an explosion of colour 
And speaking of art, the MuseumsQuartier is not to be missed. The former imperial court stables for around 600 
horses and 200 carriages is now home to over 60 cultural institutions. Among its main attractions are the Leopold 
Museum, which holds a vast Schiele collection, the MUMOK Museum of Modern Art, and Austria's Museum of 
Architecture, Architekturzentrum Wien.
Head further into the heart of Vienna, where you will find the grand, gothic St Stephen's Cathedral, which at 136 
meters in height, is the tallest church in Austria. Located in the bustling Stephansplatz, the cathedral is free to enter 
and take in the stunning architecture, but for an added cost you can book a tour of its catacombs or climb both of 
the cathedral's towers.
And with great composers a crucial part of Vienna's heritage, it's worth paying a visit to the grand Vienna State 
Opera, where guided tours last approximately 40 minutes.
Every evening, 10,000 music enthusiasts listen to live classical music in Vienna, and Christmas is a particularly 
busy time for live performances thanks to its annual advent concert schedule. You can find out more about the 
schedule for 2023 here.
Dining and drinking
Bursting with culture, there really is something for everyone to enjoy in Vienna, from local, Austrian cuisine to 
unique, globally-inspired dishes. Before we had even packed our bags, I'd heard a lot about the city's coffeehouse 
culture, and Central Cafe located in the inner city seemed to be the main tourist hangout. 
This Art Deco haunt is not your typical cafe, with grand arched ceilings and marble columns throughout. It's a must-
do for those who want to enjoy some delicious Austrian sweet treats to the backdrop of a tinkling piano. But be 
warned, it's a hit with tourists and you might struggle to get a table without booking ahead.
Experience a taste of Lebanon from chef Khaled at InterContinental's Parlor 
For dinner, we ventured to Parlor at InterContinental Hotel, where we experienced a "Taste of Lebanon" by chef 
Khaled Akoum. Here, you can expect staff who greet you like an old friend and take a genuine interest in your day.
The menu has a wide range of dishes to choose from and caters well to those with vegan and vegetarian diets - 
which was a huge bonus for us. The mezze platters are a great option if you can't decide on a dish, and are perfect 
for sharing.
Although we were almost too full for dessert, Chef Khaled specially crafted a dessert selection plate for us with a 
little taste of everything on the menu - which we gladly found some room for. Think pancakes, stuffed with walnut, 
and bitesize vanilla cream cake, all drizzled with a super sweet syrup.
There is so much to see and do in Vienna at Christmas 
During our stay, a cosy ramen restaurant just a short walk from our hotel caught our eye one evening.
Our interest was piqued by a review on TripAdvisor, describing it as the "best ramen house in Vienna". Karma 
Ramen is a small, quirky restaurant serving up a decent selection of Ramen bowls and side dishes, with plenty of 
choice for vegetarians and vegans.
Given the size of the restaurant, it's probably best to reserve. Noodles here are made fresh every day and many 
ingredients are sourced from regional suppliers. Though I certainly haven't tried enough of Vienna's ramen houses 
Vienna travel guide: A weekend at Europe's 'best' Christmas market destination
to decide whether Karma Ramen is the "best", the Yasai Ramen was the perfect way to warm up after a chilly, 
festive day.

BARRY O HALLORAN  European markets surged late 
yesterday as US Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, signalled that an end to rising interest rates may be in 
sight.
Addressing a gathering at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia, the US central bank chief said the need to slow the 
world s biggest economy had to be balanced with the risk that it could move too far and noted the bank had made 
progress in its fight against inflation.
DUBLIN Traders said most Irish stocks rallied as investors took in details of Mr Powell s speech.
Ryanair climbed 2.42 per cent to close at EUR 18 as airlines across Europe enjoyed the general good sentiment 
towards equities despite lingering fuel price concerns.
Oil producers  cartel Opec said member countries would cut production by around 900,000 barrels a day next 
month, but was fuzzy on the detail. Crude prices remained stable as a result yesterday.
Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment gained 2.69 per cent to EUR 147.10. Packaging giant Smurfit Kappa 
gained 2.44 per cent to EUR 35.65.
Among the smaller stocks, dealers said that Irish banks did well. AIB rose 1 per cent to EUR 4.296, while Bank of 
Ireland added 1.2 per cent to EUR 8.694.
LONDON Predictions that 2024 would be a good year for commodities such as copper drove a strong start 
to December for mining stocks, which helped London s blue chip FTSE 100 index gain more than 1 per cent 
yesterday.
Anglo American climbed 169 pence sterling or 7.9 per cent to 2,311p. Antofagasta added 87p or 6.2 per cent to 
1,495.5p. In the same vein Rio Tinto rose 200p or 3.7 per cent to 5,599p while Glencore climbed 15.9p or 3.6 per 
cent to 457.7p.
Europe surges on Fed interest rates signal
Irish DIY and builders  suppliers Grafton Group, which has its sole listing in London, added 1.4 per cent to close at 
820.7p. The owner of Woodies  DIY chain benefited from a strong performance across building and housing stocks 
spurred by positive interest rate signals from the US.
Aer Lingus owner International Consolidated Airlines  Group (IAG) gained 2.2 per cent to 156.5p.
EUROPE The miners  strong performance helped boost the benchmark S&P Stoxx 600, which covers 
leading companies across 18 European markets, by 1 per cent on the day. The gain left the index 6.45 per 
cent ahead of its November 1st close.
News that euro zone inflation slipped to 2.4 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in October drove gains across the 
region, with leading markets all ending the day ahead. Germany s DAX was up 1.1 per cent, while France s leading 
index the CAC 40 added 0.5 per cent.
Air France KLM climbed 3 per cent to EUR 11.98 on a good day for airlines. Lufthansa s stock accelerated at the 
same rate to EUR 8.22.
US Wall Street s main indexes inched higher 
yesterday after Mr Powell acknowledged progress in lowering inflation.
Drugmaker Pfizer, which has a strong Irish presence, fell 4.6 per cent as it scrapped a plan to advance a twice-
daily version of oral weight-loss drug Danuglipron into late-stage studies, delaying its entry into the lucrative market.
Paramount Global climbed 7.6 per cent on a report the media company and Apple have discussed bundling their 
streaming services at a discount.
Tesla underperformed megacap peers, falling 1.6 per cent, as the electric vehicle maker priced its Cybertruck 
above its initial forecast.   Additional reporting: Bloomberg, Reuters

Ryanair became the latest airline to say it has found unauthorised parts in two aircraft engines. The chief executive, 
Michael O'Leary, said the suspect parts were discovered during scheduled maintenance checks and removed. Air 
regulators are investigating the global supply of thousands of Airbus and Boeing engine parts supplied with fake

WHAT the f*** is going on with all the bad language?
This week, Elon Musk, Denis O'Brien and Mary Lou McDonald let fly with colourful phrases.
X owner Musk is a free speech absolutist with zero tolerance for advertisers threatening to pull out over culture war 
rows on the site.
"If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising? Blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself. Go f*** yourself. 
Is that clear?"
Meanwhile, telecoms billionaire Denis O'Brien criticised tech giants Meta and Google, calling them "greedy f***s".
He said telecom operators are "b****xed" and the industry is now "s***e". In the Dail, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou 
accused the Government of "an exercise of the most brazen arsecovering" following last week's stabbing and 
subsequent riots.
The only one who usually requires asterisks in quotes is Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who says things like: "I 
don't give a f*** if no-one likes me".
Used when necessary, it's a great release and is refreshing and impactful.
It's clever too - social studies find cursing builds camaraderie within a group, especially if it faces opposition.
It forges "parasocial" bonds, where a person feels close to someone they don't actually know.

Highlight: A combination of emissions taxes and airport fees mean that the cost of flying to some European 
destinations is set to rise
Body
Flying will become “something for the rich and privileged” as airlines face significant tax rises on jet fuel, according 
to Jet2’s boss, with some destinations set to get more expensive than others.
Speaking at the Jet2holidays conference in Turkey this week, Steve Heapy, the chief executive of Jet2, said that 
the aviation sector produces less carbon dioxide than other industries, including meat production, yet airlines have 
to pay more in carbon taxes.
For decades, a tax exemption on jet fuel has enabled airlines operating in the UK and the EU to keep prices 
artificially low. Now, a growing list of environmentally charged levies are being placed on aviation as governments 
work towards 2050 net zero targets.
So what exactly is about to change, and which destinations are set to become more expensive?
                     Carbon permits and a “massive” tax hike                   
Under the UK’s emissions trading scheme (ETS), the cost for a permit per tonne of carbon dioxide had risen by a 
factor of almost 16 in just five years. Heapy said that Jet2 omits approximately 2.2 million tonnes of CO2 per year. 
In 2018, the permit cost £5 per tonne. Today, that has risen to £78 per tonne, he said.
The aviation industry may have been subject to tax waivers on jet fuel until now, but this could be about to change: 
Heapy warned that the rolling out of a “massive” EU-wide tax on jet fuel could mean higher ticket prices for the 
consumer.
“Imagine your tax rate went up to 70 per cent – that’s what’s going to happen with jet fuel,” he warned this week.
The cost of flying is rising, and these holiday favourites will go up the most
The rise in flight tickets is already happening and there are many factors at play, including rejuvenated demand for 
travel after the pandemic, airlines recouping lost earnings,an increase in air passenger duty (APD) , and a spike in 
the cost of oil following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, more recently, the war in the Middle East.
Change is already underway. Earlier this year, easyJet  revealed that its average fares (from January to March, 
2023) were up 31 per cent year-on-year. Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of the low-cost airline, said the rise 
was down to significant cost increases, notably the price of jet fuel. Ryanair’s fees increased by 20 per cent in 2022, 
and jumped by another 15 per cent in 2023.
                     Ryanair to slim down Portugal routes                   
Heapy’s words come just days after Ryanair said it would be reducing its services from the UK to a number of 
destinations in Portugal, due to increased airport charges.
“We have recently been victims of the ANA/Vinci monopoly, which has extraordinarily increased airport charges for 
next year,” said Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair. ANA Aeroportos de Portugal manages 10 
Portuguese airports.
Ryanair closed its base in Ponta Delgada in the Azores this winter for this reason, and warned that there could be a 
further reduction in services to Portugal on the horizon.
“If ANA continues with these latest monopoly price increases to 2024, then Ryanair intends to downsize one of its 
two Madeira-based planes and significantly reduce our schedules to and from Faro and Porto for summer 2024,” 
O’Leary said.
Portugal is set to increase its airport fees by an average of 14.6 per cent in 2024, amounting to approximately €1.60 
(£1.38) per passenger, per flight. This, O’Leary said, would “harm Portugal’s competitiveness” and “crowd out 
much-needed tourism growth”.
Madeira could face a double hit. Because it is in the outer regions of the EU, it has always been exempt from the 
EU’s Emission Trading Scheme charge. However, this exemption is due to be removed by January 1, 2024 (when 
flying in from other EU member states), which will likely lead to higher ticket prices. The Canary Islands will also be 
affected by this change. Heapy predicts this could increase the cost of flying to these destinations by £25.
                     The dawning of “green fuel”                   
The introduction of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) could contribute to a rise in the cost of flying. The topic was in 
the news this week, when Virgin made its first transatlantic flight using the jet fuel alternative. 
Willie Walsh, director general of IATA and a former chief executive of British Airways, said: “It will mean higher 
fares, because sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than your traditional jet kerosene. And as we transition 
to net zero, it is going to cost some money.”
There are additional concerns regarding the scalability of SAF, with suggestions that it could never be applied to 
more than a limited number of flights.
The rise of airline ticket prices will have an impact not just on the tourist’s pocket, but on the destination itself. A 
2022 Deloitte report entitled “Flying Towards a sustainable future” predicted that, for Spain, the emerging suite of 
aviation taxation measures could mean a loss of up to 11 million international tourists per year.
There are certain destinations that already cost more to reach.
Based on the average ticket price between 2017 and 2022, the cost of flying from the UK to Istanbul has risen by 
69.4 per cent, according to OAG data. Other cities to have seen significant rises include Amsterdam (31.1 per cent), 
Rome (33.3 per cent) and Santander (60.9 per cent).
The cost of flying is rising, and these holiday favourites will go up the most
The overall cost of package holidays is on the up, too. A Which? comparison of average prices for package 
holidays in six popular destinations revealed that a week’s break in 2023 increased by an average of 30 per cent 
year-on-year – to £867 per person. A seven-night trip to Italy cost £616.68 per person on average last year. This 
year, the same trip would cost £757.53 – an increase of 23 per cent.

The British Airline Pilots Association issued the following news release:
BALPA is delighted with the court win for one of its members that is likely to have significant wider implications for 
aviation in terms of the employment status and rights of so called 'self-employed' pilots and agency workers.
An Employment Appeal Tribunal has handed down the attached judgment in our case of Lutz v Ryanair & Storm 
Global (formerly MCG Aviation).
This appeal came about when both Ryanair and Storm Global appealed our successful ET ruling from last year.
BALPA is delighted to have won across the board with both appeals by Ryanair and Storm Global dismissed in their 
entirety.
This is a major legal victory for BALPA on behalf of Mr Lutz and in turn our Ryanair contractor pilot members, and 
for workers' rights generally. We have established that the member in whose name we brough this test claim, Jason 
Lutz, was a 'crew member' and a 'worker' of Storm Global (and that the intermediary company he was required to 
set up was a 'sham'), thereby entitling him to holiday pay and other rights; and that he was an 'agency worker' of 
both Storm Global and Ryanair, which entitles him to the same employment conditions as those pilots recruited 
directly to Ryanair after a certain period of service.
You can hear Jason Lutz speak about the support BALPA has given him here (https://youtu.be/UoZiVZYdbVU):

Tribunal

here(https://d15khrjun3ryw0.cloudfront.net/2022/04/Case-Lutz-v-Ryanair-and-Mcginley.pdf)) stated the following:
'Mr Lutz was not in business in his own account and Ryanair and MCG [Storm Global] were not his clients; that 
there was a complete imbalance of power and Mr Lutz was not able to alter anything about the arrangements; that 
the service company he was required to use was a fiction; that the substitution clause in the written agreement was 
British Airline Pilots Association : Legal Win on Self-Employment
a sham; and that the dominant purpose of the arrangement was for Mr Lutz to provide personal service as pilot to 
Ryanair.'
BALPA was represented by Alice Yandle and Caitlin Farrar of Farrer & Co, and Michael Ford KC and Stuart 
Brittenden of Old Square Chambers. Farrer & Co commented that:
"The Employment Appeal Tribunal has robustly rejected Ryanair's and Storm Global's (formerly MCG's) grounds of 
appeal in full. The decision to uphold the Employment Tribunal's findings has immense implications for the use of 
the pilot contractor model in the aviation sector, and leaves the way open for other potential claims by pilots 
engaged under similar arrangements."
Interim General Secretary and Head of Legal Services at BALPA, Miranda Rackley said:
"Once again the courts have ruled in our favour and that's not only good news for Jason Lutz, but also for all the 
other similarly purported "self-employed" pilots in the aviation sector.
"We urge Ryanair and Storm Global to take note of the ruling and to focus on working with BALPA to set out 
clearer, more secure forms of employment for their pilots."

Highlight: Leg room, seat width, baggage allowance, punctuality – we’ve measured everything that counts and 
crowned a definitive winner
Body
They’re the airlines we love to hate, whisking passengers across Europe for low fares with incredible regularity – in 
theory, at least. But the reality of “budget” airlines , as all-too many of us know, can be fraught with hidden fees, 
confusing baggage allowances and copious delays.
However, not all budget airlines are created equal. In a bid to find the best carrier, we’ve compared Wizz Air, Jet2, 
easyJet and Ryanair on all of the key credentials. There is a clear winner – and loser – but do you agree? Have 
your say in the poll and comments below. 
                     Best for routes and connections                   
By passenger numbers, Ryanair is Europe’s largest budget operator: it flew more than 17 million people in October 
alone. Its last recorded fleet size is 565 (as of summer 2023), by far the biggest of our survey, serving more than 
240 airports across 40 countries.
Ryanair is also the best-connected of the bunch. It flies from 21 UK airports, including lesser-served areas such as 
Newquay and Teesside, so we’re rating it top for UK range. Its routes include rarer low-cost destinations too, such 
as Jordan, Montenegro and Casablanca. 
Currently operating from 18 UK airports, easyJet serves 155 airports across 36 countries. It is Europe’s second 
largest airline by passenger numbers (pipped by Ryanair), with a large fleet of 336 planes.
In March 2024, easyJet will open a new three-aircraft base in Birmingham, adding 16 new routes to its current tally 
of 1,024. For connectivity, it comes second place to Ryanair.
The best (and worst) budget airlines in the UK
In third place is Wizz Air, which serves 73 destinations directly from the UK, plus more than 100 others via 
connections – including cities in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. 
There are 179 aircraft in the Wizz Air fleet, and it has hubs at London Luton and Gatwick. It flies from a further six 
UK airports: Glasgow, Birmingham, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Leeds and Liverpool, so has a fair regional coverage.
For routes and connectivity, Jet2 ranks fourth. It flies to over 65 European destinations from 11 UK airports, with a 
new base at Liverpool opening in March. Other hubs include Birmingham, Bristol, East Midlands, Edinburgh, 
Glasgow, Leeds and Stansted.
It operates 119 aircraft, and is the UK’s third largest scheduled airline; notable destinations include Norway, 
Morocco, Cyprus and Iceland. 
                       The winner: Ryanair                   
                       The loser: Wizz Air has a higher number of destinations than Jet2 – but the latter scoops Wizz on its 
choice of UK airports. It’s a tie                   
                     Best prices for Easter 2024                   
Let’s say you want to fly from London to Malaga next Easter, 30 March to 12 April – hand luggage only. Which 
airline has the cheapest fares? 
The price per adult offered by Ryanair currently starts from £262.86 (Stansted); easyJet £207.98 (Gatwick); Wizz 
Air £219.98 (Gatwick); and Jet2 £382.90 (Stansted). Prices were sourced directly from the airlines on Dec 1, 2023, 
and are inclusive of booking fees.
                       The winner: easyJet, for a decent £207.98 per adult fare                   
                       The loser: Jet2                   
                     Best for seat comfort                   
When it comes to seat width, our four airlines are pretty much equal. On Wizz’s Airbus A320 and easyJet’s Airbus 
A321neo, the seats are 18cm wide. Opt for Jet2’s Boeing 737-300 or Ryanair’s Boeing 737-800, and you’ll miss out 
on 10mm: their seat width is 17cm.
But when it comes to seat pitch, there’s a clear winner. This is the distance between any point on one seat and the 
same point on the seat in front – so is a good measure of not only leg room, but “headspace” and perception of 
roominess in the cabin. According to Seat Guru, and verified by the airlines, Wizz’s seat pitch is 28cm, easyJet’s 
29cm, Ryanair’s 30cm, and Jet2’s 31cm. 
                       The winner: Jet2                   
                       The loser: Wizz Air                   
                     Best for punctuality                   
If you boarded a flight anywhere this summer, chances are it was delayed or cancelled.  Airport strikes, wildfires, air 
traffic meltdowns: which airline fared best against the odds?
The aviation analysts at OAG provided Telegraph Travel with data across more than half a million flights from June 
1 to Sept 3, covering airlines departing from 48 UK airports. 
Ryanair operated 91,897 flights, of which 31.8 per cent arrived or departed on time. For easyJet, 44.7 per cent of its 
111,551 flights were on schedule, while 57.7 per cent of Jet2’s 38,986 services ran as planned. 
The best (and worst) budget airlines in the UK
The data from OAG suggested that Wizz Air managed to depart or arrive on time on just 7.8 per cent of its services. 
The airline contested the figure, insisting that “almost half” of departures and “almost 40 per cent” of arrivals were 
on time. It added: “The majority of delays were due to issues outside of Wizz Air’s control, such as the recent air 
traffic control fault, meaning these statistics are not an accurate representation of our overall performance.”
                       The winner: Jet2                   
                       The loser: A tie between Ryanair and Wizz Air                   
                     Best for hand baggage allowance                   
We compared the size and weight limits for free hand baggage, on a standard ticket. 
Jet2: 56 x 45 x 25cm (total volume 63,000cm3); maximum 10kg
easyJet: 45 x 36 x 20cm (total volume 32,400cm3), “which needs to fit in our baggage gauge and under the seat in 
front of you”. Maximum 15kg
Wizz Air: 40 x 30 x 20cm (total volume 24,000cm3), and “must be placed at the feet of the passenger under the 
seat in front of them”. Maximum 10kg
Ryanair: 40 x 20 x 25cm (total volume 20,000cm3); no weight limit is listed
                       The winner: easyJet’s 15kg limit is the most generous weight – but for size, Jet2 is the best. Its 
volume allowance is more than three times the size offered by Ryanair                   
                       The loser: Ryanair                   
                     Best for checked-in luggage                   
When you pay to bring a suitcase, there’s a sliding scale of fees. For ease of comparison, the following covers 
luggage weighing 20kg or more, booked at the same time as your flight. 
With Ryanair, a 20kg bag costs £18.99 to £59.99, according to your route and travel dates – the lowest weight 
allowance of our four airlines. Excess baggage ranges from £9 to £11 per kilo, the cheapest fee in this comparison.
Jet2’s baggage add-on covers bags up to 22kg: costs vary, and it doesn’t quote a ballpark fee online if you don’t 
have a booking. According to mybaggage.com, the average cost is £21 each way. Excess weight is £12 per kilo.
Wizz charges between £8.25 and £87.11 for a 20kg bag, in peak season, with an excess fee of £12 per kilo. On 
easyJet, 23kg of hold luggage costs from £9.49 per item; excess weight is £12 per kilo.
                       The winner: The varying prices make it hard to compare fees, but easyJet’s baggage allowance is 
the most generous, at 23kg                   
                       The loser: It’s a tie:Ryanair and Wizz Air offer 20kg each. The latter’s upper threshold is the most 
costly, though Jet2 isn’t transparent about its fees unless you have a booking with them                   
                     Best for fines and fees                   
To change a name on a booking, Ryanair charges £115 per flight. To change your flights costs £45, plus any 
additional fare. To check in at the airport rather than on the app, Ryanair charges £30 or £55 if flying from Spain. 
Boarding pass reissue is £20.
Name changes with Jet2 cost £35; flight changes are £35, plus any additional fare. No charge for airport check-in or 
boarding pass print-out.
The best (and worst) budget airlines in the UK
With easyJet, name changes cost £55; flight changes are £25 if more than 60 days before travel, or £49 if within 60 
days, plus any additional fare. There is no charge for airport check-in or boarding pass print-out. 
Name changes with Wizz cost £55; flight changes cost £36.50 to £46, plus any additional fare. If you want to check 
in at the airport, you can pre-book online for £11.50 per flight; airport check-in without pre-booking costs £35.50.
Be warned: in many instances, the above fees are higher if arranged via a customer services agent, rather than 
online. 
                       The winner: Jet2                   
                       The loser: Ryanair                   
                     Best for priority boarding                   
Jet2 is the only airline not to offer speedy boarding as an optional add-on. But if you want to board first (or at least 
be in the queue to board first), Ryanair’s priority access costs from £6 to £36, and includes two cabin bags.
Wizz’s package costs up to €58.80 (£50.62) when booked in advance, and includes priority boarding and check-in, 
plus a carry-on wheelie. To get “Speedy Boarding” on easyJet, you’ll need an easyJet Plus card (£215 annually), 
pay for a Standard Plus or Flexi fare, or add a large cabin bag to your booking – priced “from £5.99”.
                       The winner: There really isn’t much between easyJet and Ryanair                   
                       The loser: Jet2, for not offering the option                   
                     Best rated on Trustpilot                    
On customer review website Trustpilot, Jet2 is by far the best-rated of the airlines – scoring an overall 4.5 
(“Excellent”) out of a possible five. It has five-star reviews from 72 per cent of reviewers; four stars from 14 per cent; 
and one star from 7 per cent. 
“Pleasant and attentive cabin crew,” reads one verified Jet2 customer review. “Friendly and informative captain. 
Took off an hour late but we made up 25 minutes. Excellent.”
It’s a different story for the rest of the pack. Ryanair and easyJet both score 1.4 stars overall, and Wizz Air 1.3 stars 
(out of five). A total of 89 per cent of Wizz customers awarded it just one star.
“Robbery,” states a reviewer of one of the airlines. “I don’t understand why people still buy ticket[s] from that 
airline… [it] should not be allowed to operate in our society.”
                       The winner: Jet2                   
                       The loser: Wizz                   
                     Best rated by The Telegraph                   
In this year’s Telegraph Travel Awards, Jet2 was voted “best short-haul airline” – scooping the top spot for the 
second consecutive time. Almost 30,000 readers voted in the awards, widely praising Jet2 for its clear contact with 
passengers, and giving refunds without fuss.  
Further down the table, easyJet took 10th place, Ryanair 22nd and Wizz Air came 23rd – the very last place. Wizz 
faced criticism from Telegraph readers for its slow refunds, last-minute cancellations and poor customer service. 
                       The winner: Jet2                   
                       The loser: Wizz                   
The best (and worst) budget airlines in the UK
                     The verdict: which is the best?                   
Bravo to Jet2, which is rated consistently high for customer satisfaction, baggage allowance and comfort – while 
offering the lowest fees and fines among its peers. Our study suggests it doesn’t come cheap, though: in our fare 
comparison, it was the most expensive by £174.92.
At the other end of the spectrum, the wooden spoon goes to Wizz. It tallies three individual “loser” titles and three 
shared ones, and no “wins” to its name – thanks to hefty delays, terrible reviews, reportedly poor service and costly 
(yet measly) bag allowance.
A Wizz Air spokesman said: “This year, we have invested more than £90 million to improve our operations, 
including our customer service. Our customer data shows Wizz Air’s brand consideration ratio to be higher than our 
main UK competitor. We also perform better in customer service, refunds, ease of booking and information provided 
to customers.
“While there will always be situations outside our control such as weather and air traffic control problems, we still 
completed 99.16 per cent of our flights this summer which is a significant improvement from last year and in line 
with industry standards. More than 90 per cent of refunds and claims were also processed within five days.
“Regarding costs, ticket prices and costs for optional extras are clearly outlined on our website and app. We are an 
ultra-low-cost carrier and to keep our fares low, we offer optional add-ons at an additional charge, such as checked 
luggage or preferential seating. Unbundling products means that customers only need to pay for what they need 
and we can offer the most affordable and exciting travel opportunities.
“Optional add-ons are not required in order to fly, and we believe that customers should be offered the choice and 
flexibility to choose the right products for them.”

Ryanair caught up in unauthorised aircraft parts scandal
Ryanair caught up in unauthorised aircraft parts scandal

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has reported the discovery of unauthorised aircraft components in two engines, 
making the Irish carrier the latest to be embroiled in a scandal involving the distribution of aircraft parts with falsified 
certification documents.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the parts likely originated from UK-based AOG Technics, although Ryanair had 
no direct business dealings with the little-known group.
The unauthorised parts were found and removed during routine maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil in recent 
months.
 AOG Technics was accused in September of a "deliberate, dishonest and sophisticated scheme" to supply 
unauthorised engine parts that ended up in Boeing aircraft.
Lawyers of jet engine maker CFM International told the High Court how AOG potentially sold thousands of engine 
components using forged paperwork.
Barrister Matthew Reeve QC of Quadrant Chambers said there was "compelling documentary evidence that 
thousands of jet engine parts have been sold by (AOG) to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with the 
claimants' jet engines", according to Reuters reporters covering the case.
Virgin Australia (ASX:VAH), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines grounded some aircraft when the 
news came to light, though Ryanair remains "largely unaffected" overall by the scandal, O'Leary commented.
Ryanair caught up in unauthorised aircraft parts scandal
According to Companies House filings, AOG has one director, Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, who is also listed as a 
director at Sunwave Solutions Ltd and Kensho Group, the former of which dissolved earlier this year.
AOG has taken its website down, while Zamora Yrala does not have an active LinkedIn profile.

SARAJEVO (Bosnia and Herzegovina), December 1 (SeeNews) - The Tourism Association of the Sarajevo Canton 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina said it relaunched a call for financial incentives to airlines that will introduce flights to the 
Sarajevo International Airport in 2024, approximately a week after disclosing the results from the previous 
procedure.
The call is for airlines which plan to open a base at the airport and introduce new direct flights to strategic 
destinations or long-haul flights, the Tourism Association of the Sarajevo Canton said in a tender published earlier 
this week.
Interested airlines can apply to the call by December 28.
Last week, Sarajevo International Airport said that the Tourism Association of the Sarajevo Canton had selected 
Hungarian Wizz Air, Irish Ryanair, and Turkish SunExpress in the initial tender for subsidies, which was launched in 
November. The new call does not provide reasons for the relaunch of the tender.
Passenger numbers at the Sarajevo International Airport surged to 1.38 million in 2022, compared with 767,134 
passengers served a year earlier. Bosnia and Herzegovina has three other international airports, located in Banja 
Luka, Tuzla and Mostar.
The Sarajevo Canton is one of ten cantons making up the Federation, one of two autonomous entities that form 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The other entity is the Serb Republic.

Green light for runway extension at Waterford Airport

A MULTIMILLION-euro investment in Waterford Airport, from which the last commercial flight departed seven years 
ago, is to be given the green light.
A combined private-sector and State investment is expected to be announced today by Finance Minister Michael 
McGrath regarding the much-anticipated extension to the airport's runway.
Up to (EURO)12million is expected to be invested from the private sector. However, matching Government funding 
has not yet been approved.
Local authorities around the southeast are also to be asked for financial contributions, which could see the overall 
investment topping (EURO)30million.
A 150-metre runway extension was promised 10 years ago, to be funded by the Department of Transport, but the 
plan never came to fruition.
Planning permission was granted last year for the runway extension but private investment stalled.
In 2022, the board started talks with the billionaire Comer brothers from Galway to buy a majority stake in the 
airport.
Mr McGrath is expected to be in
Waterford today to make the announcement on the airport's future.
Waterford Airport opened in 1981 with Ryanair operating its first scheduled flight four years www.later.No 
commercial flights have left Waterford Airport in the past seven years but a runway extension could pave the way 
for their return. In its final year of commercial flight operations, Waterford handled 13,511 passengers.

As part of the expansion, Ryanair will base two Boeing 737-8-200 aircraft at Dubrovnik airport and introduce 16 new 
routes, enhancing connectivity to popular destinations across Europe. The newly announced routes include:
London Stansted (2x daily)
Rome Fiumicino (10x weekly)

In addition to the new routes, Ryanair will increase frequencies on existing summer-only routes from Dublin 
International (from 4x weekly to 2x daily) and Vienna (from 3x weekly to 8x weekly). The move aims to meet 
growing demand and provide passengers with expanded travel options during the summer season.
While Ryanair currently does not operate flights to Dubrovnik in the winter season, the establishment of a seasonal 
base highlights the airline's strategic focus on capturing summer travel demand in the popular Croatian destination.
Ryanair's other bases in Croatia include Zagreb Franjo Tudman, serving as the only year-round destination, and 
seasonal bases in Osijek, Pula, Rijeka, and Split during the summer months. The expansion into Dubrovnik further 
solidifies Ryanair's presence in the Croatian market, providing travelers with increased accessibility to diverse 
European destinations during the peak travel season.

In addition to the new routes, Ryanair will increase frequencies on existing summer-only routes from Dublin 
International (from 4x weekly to 2x daily) and Vienna (from 3x weekly to 8x weekly). The move aims to meet 
growing demand and provide passengers with expanded travel options during the summer season.
While Ryanair currently does not operate flights to Dubrovnik in the winter season, the establishment of a seasonal 
base highlights the airline's strategic focus on capturing summer travel demand in the popular Croatian destination.
Ryanair's other bases in Croatia include Zagreb Franjo Tudman, serving as the only year-round destination, and 
seasonal bases in Osijek, Pula, Rijeka, and Split during the summer months. The expansion into Dubrovnik further 
solidifies Ryanair's presence in the Croatian market, providing travelers with increased accessibility to diverse

European LCCs leverage net cash positions
European LCCs leverage net cash positions

European low-cost heavyweights Ryanair and Easyjet reported net cash positions at the end of September 2023, 
which will help support increasing capital expenditure in the coming years.
Ryanair's net cash totalled (EURO)840 million ($919 million) as of 30 September, versus (EURO)560 million in 
March and net debt of (EURO)500 million as of 30 Sep 2022, with over (EURO)1 billion of debt repayments made 
during the first half of the year. All of the Group's owned Boeing 737 fleet (534 aircraft) are unencumbered, said the 
carrier.
Ryanair took delivery of 26 Boeing 737 Max 8200s in the first half of the year to reach 124 Max units at the end of 
September. The company noted that its debt free 737 fleet provides flexibility for financing options including bonds 
through its Euro medium term notes (EMTN) programme, bank financing, sale and leasebacks and Jolco 
financings.
The carrier said it is on track to repay its second 2023 bond of (EURO)750 million due next month and (EURO)2.8 
billion of fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures (capex) using internal cash resources. "We are determined to pay 
down our remaining debt as it matures between now and 2026," the carrier stated in its first half results.
UK low-cost carrier Easyjet returned to a net cash position of £41 million ($52 million) at the end of fiscal-year 2023. 
This compares with net debt of £670 million at the same time in 2022 and £326 million as of 30 September 2019.
Easyjet had unrestricted access to £4.7 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and money market 
deposits of £2.92 billion (versus £3.64 billion in 2022) and borrowings of approximately £1.85 billion, despite 
repaying £1.2 billion of gross debt and the purchase of 10 aircraft during the year.
During the financial year, it repaid the drawn element of the UK Export Finance (UKEF) facility and its February 
2016 (EURO)500 million Eurobond, reducing gross debt.
The carrier also repaid $950 million of debt under the UKEF facility, replacing it with a new $1.75 billion undrawn 
five-year sustainability-linked term loan facility in the third quarter.
European LCCs leverage net cash positions
Easyjet said this benefited net interest costs in the second half of the financial year, with a positive impact from 
higher interest rates on cash balances throughout the whole year, resulting in the net finance charge for the year of 
£48 million being 59% lower than the prior year.
"This strength, reflected in the investment grade credit ratings we hold, positions easyJet to be able to prepare for 
the capex coming over the next few years, as aircraft deliveries increase, but also provides a base to deal with 
those challenges and opportunities that the current macro-economic environment may present," it said in its annual 
report.
The carrier reported headline ROCE of 12.6% driven by the higher headline profit before interest, foreign exchange 
gains and tax of £476 million this year, combined with the reduction in net debt.
In October Easyjet sold three Airbus A319 units to parties and leased them back. The carrier booked £32 million in 
gross proceeds. This followed the sale and leaseback transactions of eight A319 aircraft in the 2023 financial year 
which resulted in a net cash inflow of £76 million.
Easyjet's total fleet as of 30 September 2023 comprised 336 aircraft, compared with 320 aircraft a year ago.

Ryanair Holdings Plc(NASDAQ:RYAAY) reportedly discovered unauthorized parts in two aircraft engines, joining 
other significant airlines in dealing with the issue of components distributed withcounterfeit certification documents.
During routine maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil over recent months, the questionable parts were found in 
aircraft engines and removed, according to a newsreportby Bloomberg, citing CEO Michael O'Leary in a Dublin 
interview.
According to aviation authorities, a lesser-known London firm, AOG Technics Ltd., is alleged to have provided 
thousands of engine parts with counterfeit certification documents forAirbus SE(OTC:EADSY) (OTC:EADSF) 
andBoeing Company(NYSE:BA) aircraft, the report read.

This includes older-generation 737s operated by Ryanair.
Other airlines, such asDelta Air Lines, Inc.(NYSE:DAL),American Airlines Group, Inc.(NASDAQ:AAL), 
andSouthwest Airlines Company(NYSE:LUV) have also discovered dubious parts, as reported by Bloomberg.
O'Leary indicated that he suspects AOG supplied the parts found in Ryanair's fleet, although the Irish budget airline 
has never directly dealt with AOG, the report read. These components for two engines were received through third 
parties.

Ryanair, which exclusively uses Boeing aircraft, has approximately 1,500 engines in its fleet, as stated by O'Leary.
"Given the level of paperwork that already exists, I'm not quite sure how anybody was able to come up with dodgy 
parts," he said, which is noted by Bloomberg.

Waterford Airport to receive multimillion investment
Waterford Airport to receive multimillion investment

SARAH SLATER  Waterford Airport is to receive a multimillion euro investment, seven years after the departure of 
its last commercial flight.
An announcement of a combination of public and private investment is expected today with the focus to be an 
extension to the airport s runway.
It is understood that up to EUR 20 million will be committed by private investors, with overall investment possibly 
topping EUR 30 million when public funding is added. 
The board of the airport is known to have begun negotiations with the billionaire Galway brothers Luke and Brian 
Comer that could see them taking a majority stake in the facility. 
The Waterford News & Star title reported earlier this month that this could amount to an 80 per cent holding. 
Runway extension A 150 metre extension to the airport s runway, funded by the Department of Transport, 
was planned a decade ago but never came to fruition. Planning permission was granted last year for a 
runway extension 
 but private investment stalled. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath is due in Waterford today to make an 
announcement about the airport s future. Waterford Airport opened in 1981, with Ryanair operating its first flight four 
years later. In its final year of commercial flight operations seven years ago, the facility handled 13,511 passengers. 
The Irish Coast Guard Air and Sea Rescue helicopter is based at the airport. Last September, Minister for Transport 
Eamon Ryan poured cold water over the commercial future of Waterford Airport, pointing to the number of aviation 
facilities already in the southeast.

Highlight: After one of the coldest nights since March, the Met Office has warned of more snow and ice
Body
The UK has been hit by a wave of snow and ice  this weekend as a major incident was declared and flights were 
grounded.  
The coldest overnight temperature this winter was recorded in northern Scotland, the Met Office  said, as Altnaharra 
in the Highland region dropped to -12.5C.
It comes as thousands of people across Cumbria woke up without power on Sunday morning after heavy snowfall  
affected Electricity North West’s service. 
East Midlands Airport was forced to temporarily close its runway after heavy snow  blanketed the ground. 
The airport said in a tweet at about 8.10am today: “Due to snow, our runway is temporarily closed. We will update 
you as soon as possible.”
On Saturday morning, Glasgow Airport suspended all flights as many inbound flights were diverted, delayed or 
cancelled. The inbound Wizz Air flight from Budapest landed at Edinburgh, while a Ryanair jet from Malaga touched 
down in Prestwick.
Yellow weather warnings for snow and ice  are currently in place in large parts of Scotland, the Midlands, Wales 
and the North East, with snow and ice set to disrupt roads and railways.
There is a yellow warning for rain from midnight until 6pm Monday which affects most of southern England, Wales 
and the West Midlands.
                       For the latest on the cold weather across the UK, follow our live blog                                        
Mapped: Snow and ice Met Office warnings as UK hit by overnight freeze
The freezing weather is being caused by a blast of cold air from northern Scandinavia, resulting in a particularly 
cold snap for many northern and eastern parts of the UK.
After a relatively mildNovember , temperatures plummeted this week  with snow falling on Wednesday morning 
across parts of Yorkshire and Scotland. The flurries continued into Thursday evening with North Yorkshire Police 
reporting 100 cars stuck on the A171, between Whitby and Scarborough.
And on Friday morning, icy conditions on the roads resulted in 20 schools in County Durham closing.
In London, where commuters woke up to temperatures of -4C  on Friday morning, mayor Sadiq Khan activated a 
“severe weather emergency protocol” for accommodation to be opened for rough sleepers.
The first snow of the season was even reported in parts of the capital including West Hampstead, Ealing and 
Islington.
Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “Last night was a cold night across the country  with a widespread 
frost as temperatures fell well below freezing for most.
“Colder conditions are now covering all areas of the UK and we will see little change as we go into the weekend.
“Daytime temperatures will be rooted in single figures and overnight temperatures falling well below freezing in 
many places. We will continue to see wintry showers at times and where these showers fall as rain there is a risk of 
icy patches forming.”
The yellow weather warnings in place warn of disruption to roads and railways, and of the risk of icy patches on 
roads, pavements and footpaths.
Alongside the Met Office warnings, the government’s UK Health Security Agency has amber cold health alerts in 
place for five regions: the East Midlands, West Midlands, North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber 
until December 5.
The alerts warn of the cold weather impacting the regions’ health services.

Highlight: Vigo in northern Spain is one of Skyscanner's trending destinations in 2024, in part due to its weather, 
its access to the Atlantic Ocean and its lovely old town
Body
A beautiful city in northern Spain with surrounded by lush countryside is the trending destination for Brits in 2024, 
according to one study.
Vigo is located in the picturesque region of Galicia, which is at the heart of an area called Green Spain. While much 
of the country is a little arid and dry, parts of the north and north west are lush and verdant, benefitting from the their 
location on the Atlantic.
According to research by Skyscanner, it is going to be one of the hottest destinations among holidaymakers in 
2024. The city has seen a remarkable 1,235% increase in online searches among Brits over the past year. 
It is not the first city you might think of when you're dreaming of a trip to Spain, but it is a great alternative to some 
of the more obvious, popular and often overcrowded places. Compared to Malaga and Benidorm -which are 
increasingly roasting in June, July and August -the weather in Vigo is a lovely mid-20s for much of the spring and 
summer.
The waves found off its sandy, wide beaches are found more interesting and powerful than those that gently lap 
onto the east and south coasts of Spain. At the likes of Playa Samil and Praia do Vao the Ocean swell rises up into 
a formidable force that makes it a haven for surfers. 
There's plenty to see in the city itself, which has a population of around 300,000. MARCO showcases contemporary 
art exhibitions, while theatres such as the García Barbón Theater host great local plays and dance shows. 
Sun-soaked city most Brits don't know about with golden beaches and £28 flights
The historic Old Town is a cultural hub of narrow streets, charming squares, and traditional Galician architecture. A 
pleasant afternoon can be spent wandering from here to the seafront promenade which is lined with cafes, 
restaurants, and sculptures.
Castro Fortress overlooks the bay of Vigo and provides a glimpse into the city's maritime past. The site offers 
panoramic views of the surrounding area and the Atlantic Ocean.
If that sounds like it's up your street, then the good news is that a trip to Vigo is unlikely to cost you the Earth. Right 
now there are return flights from London Stansted with Ryanair for £28 return -ideal, so long as you're willing to 
brace yourself against the nippy Atlantic winter weather.
If you are in the mood for a holiday but want something warm and soon, then another Spanish destination may be 
preferable. The Canary Islands are a popular year-round choice, celebrated for their dramatic volcanic landscapes 
and unique black sand beaches, offering a distinct and memorable getaway.
Sunseekers fleeing colder northern climes can head to Gran Canaria and Tenerife, which both enjoy average winter 
temperatures of 22°C. Party-lovers might consider trading the slightly lower average temperatures of Lanzarote for 
some of the island's famous nightlife. Check out our winter holiday guide for the islands here.

The fake parts were found during maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil
•
Michael O'Leary said components came from British supplier AOG Technics
Ryanair has become the latest airline to be hit by an international scandal after it found fake engine parts in two 
planes.
The parts were discovered during maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil during the past few months.
Major US carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also found suspect parts in their 
planes.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the bogus components came from the British supplier AOG Technics, 
which is not one of Ryanair's approved suppliers.
Regulators have been alerted to fake parts found in Boeing and Airbus planes this year and investigators have 
allegedly traced the supplies back to AOG Technics. Aviation watchdogs in the UK, US and Europe have accused 
the company of supplying engine parts with faked certification documents, raising concerns over safety.
Mr O'Leary called for tighter control of third-party jet engine suppliers. US engine maker CFM International has 
taken legal action against AOG Technics after its CFM56 model - the world's most widely used jet engine - was 
allegedly affected by the scandal.
The Civil Aviation Authority, Britain's watchdog, has issued a safety notice to airlines and said it was 'investigating 
the supply of a large number of suspect unapproved parts' that could, it said, be traced back to AOG Technics.

scandal
The EU Aviation Safety Agency said in August it was examining reports of parts with suspected falsified documents, 
while the US Federal Aviation Administration has warned airlines about the scandal. The US Justice Department is 
said to be in the early stages of a probe.
AOG Technics did not respond to a request for comment last night.

Airline Ryanair said it had found unauthorized parts in two aircraft engines, becoming the latest major airline 
involved in the distribution of components with falsified certification documents.
The suspect parts were discovered during scheduled maintenance checks in Texas (USA) and Brazil in recent 
months and have been removed from the engines, the company's CEO Michael O'Leary said in an interview in 
Dublin on Thursday (30).
Aviation regulators have accused London-based company AOG Technics of supplying thousands of engine parts 
with falsified certification documents for Airbus and Boeing models, including the previous-generation 737 models in 
use by Ryanair.
Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are among the airlines that have found suspect parts, 
Bloomberg News reported.
O'Leary said he believed AOG supplied the parts that inadvertently ended up in Ryanair's fleet. The Irish low-cost 
airline never did business directly with AOG, receiving the component for two engines through third parties, and the 
airline remains "largely unaffected" by the scandal, the CEO said.
Ryanair operates an exclusive fleet of Boeing planes and owns around 1,500 engines, O'Leary said. The founder of 
AOG, Jose Zamora Yrala, was contacted and did not respond to a telephone message requesting comment.
The CFM56 engine affected by the scandal is the most popular in global aircraft fleets. The power plant is 
manufactured by a joint venture of Safran and General Electric called CFM. In October, engine manufacturers said 
they had found 126 engines with suspect parts sold by AOG, including some installed in CFM's own repair shops.
Airlines were told to check their stocks of spare engine parts after Bloomberg first reported on AOG earlier this year, 
according to O'Leary. The components found have been sent to the groups leading the investigation into AOG, 
while the engines remain in the workshops, he added.
In the wake of the scandal, O'Leary said stricter controls were needed on third parties that supply parts for jet 
engines. "Given the level of documentation that already exists, I'm not sure how anyone managed to produce fake 
parts," he said.

Highlight: Claim comes as Scotland’s busiest airport said to be valued at more than £2 billion
Body
Edinburgh Airport is expected to be put up for sale before Christmas, a well-placed aviation source has told The 
Scotsman.
Strengthening rumours about the expected move by owners Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) came as the 
Reuters news agency reported on Friday the company was working on a sale of its majority stake.
Scotland’s busiest airport could be valued at more than £2.15 billion (€2.5bn) and sold as early as next year, 
according to unnamed sources quoted by Reuters.
New York-based fund managers GIP bought the airport in 2012 for £807 million in an auction forced on owner BAA, 
which also owned Glasgow Airport, by the Competition Commission.
It sold a 50 per cent stake in Gatwick, Britain’s second busiest airport after Heathrow, four years ago.
The latest speculation follows reports in October last year of a possible £3bn sale of Edinburgh.
The aviation source told The Scotsman: “We keep hearing rumours that the sale process is going to get underway 
imminently. As I understand it, the formal process will be starting before Christmas.
"The rumours are so strong and grounded. There is no smoke without fire. It seems to be the worst kept secret in 
the industry.”
Sources also told Reuters the owners of AGS Airports, which runs Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, 
may also sell.
Edinburgh Airport ‘to be put up for sale by Christmas’ by owners Global Infrastructure Partners
It follows Ferrovial, one of the owners, selling its 25 per cent stake in Heathrow Airport as the largest shareholder in 
a £2.37bn deal on Wednesday.
The company and Australian partners Macquarie bought what became AGS from its ownership by Heathrow in 
2014 for more then £1bn.
Flight cancellation Scotland: I’m grateful my airline got me home after my flight was cancelled, I just wish they’d told 
me how
The potential Edinburgh Airport sale comes after passenger numbers rebounded to near pre-Covid levels in the first 
half of this year. In an update published in September, the airport reported a “continued strong recovery” from the 
pandemic with 6.6 million passengers in the six months to the end of June – 93 per cent of 2019 levels.
It reported revenue up 15 per cent on the same period in 2019 to £115m.
The airport, which employs some 750 staff with a further 7,000 working for other companies on the site, said: “The 
recovery has been led by international markets with a strong rebound in both outbound and inbound travel.”
This has included Ryanair and Easyjet, the airport’s biggest airlines, basing more aircraft there with new routes, 
while Scotland’s only flights to China resumed this summer.
Other new routes include WestJet flying to Calgary in Canada, Delta resuming Atlanta flights and JetBlue launching 
New York flights next May, joining two other airlines on the route.
Postponed Edinburgh Airport runway resurfacing 'has increased risk of emergency repairs’ because of ‘significant 
patching’
The airport said it was spending £40m on improvements this year, including new security scanners, which will relax 
the 100mL hand baggage liquids limit from next June, in line with the UK Government deadline. 
However, the airport has been plagued by chronic baggage problems this year caused by a shortage of staff at 
airline handling agents Swissport and Menzies Aviation and luggage delays at hub airports.
GIP declined to comment, but AGS dismissed the reports as “simply speculation”.

Waterford Airport gets €12m for runway extension
Waterford Airport gets €12m for runway extension

Waterford Airport could see its long-awaited runway extension in place by this time next year, following an 
announcement of more than €12 million in private investment.
It is over seven years since the airport has seen a commercial flight take off from its runway but a partnership 
between existing shareholder the Bolster Group and the Comer Group which develops property on an international 
scale is set to see the necessary infrastructure put in place.
The existing runway has been seen as a barrier to attracting airlines to Waterford, because of its relatively short 
length, and while planning permission has been approved for a longer runway, local interests have been trying to 
attract funding to make this happen.
Almost half of the expected €30 million which is needed to fund the extended runway is coming from the deal with 
the Comer Group, along with local investment, with the remainder hoped to come from public funding.
The new runway will have the capacity to service large and mid-range airliners, such as the widely-used Airbus 320 
and Boeing 737, and backers hope to see Waterford Airport linking up with summer and winter holiday destinations 
across Europe. London is expected to be the first destination, possibly at the end of next year.
The current major shareholder is construction, flooring and engineering firm the Bolster Group, who have been 
driving the development of the airport since the last commercial flights operated from the site in 2016.
Meanwhile, new partners the Comer Group have been behind multi-million pound property deals in the UK and the 
continent including the Royal Connaught Park in Bushey; Mast Quay on the river Thames; Newland Park in 
Waterford Airport gets €12m for runway extension
Buckinghamshire; and The Pyramid in Berlin; as well as Irish developments such as Number One Ballsbridge and 
Milners Square in Dublin.
The investment was announced at an event in the city attended by the Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath.
"I welcome today's announcement of additional private investment in Waterford Airport," Minister McGrath said.
"An extension to the runway would make the south-east an increasingly attractive destination for both leisure and 
business travelers from overseas.
"Similarly, it will make it easier for people across the region to travel internationally. This has the potential to boost 
economic growth in the region in the decade ahead and complement significant investment already planned for 
Waterford including in urban regeneration and the South East Technological University," he added.
'Matched funding'
Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said recently during a visit to Waterford that the principle of "matched funding" remains, 
subject to the business case for the airport being agreed with the Government.
"Further exchequer funding will be required, and I urge all parties to progress the business case as soon as 
possible," Mr Varadkar said.
Waterford Airport opened in 1981 and saw off its first international flights in 1985, with Ryanair providing the 
inaugural flight to London Gatwick.
While it has not hosted commercial passengers since 2016, it is the base for the Coast Guard's R117 helicopter 
and is also used by flight schools, flying clubs and private flights.
In a joint statement Comer Group director Luke Comer and William Bolster, executive of Waterford Airport said: 
"We are delighted to announce the runway expansion, which will re-open up travel to the UK and European 
destinations all year round.
"Those local to the area have had to travel to Dublin or Cork to catch flights over the last seven years and the time 
absolutely felt right to bring the airport back to life with much-needed investment and put Waterford firmly back on 
the international map."
Fine Gael senator and former airport board member, John Cummins, welcomed today's news and said he expects 
the business case for funding to be "very well received" by the Department of Transport.
"I have constantly liaised with the Taoiseach on this matter since I was on the board of the airport. He has been a 
vocal supporter of our goal to develop a runway in the south east capable of servicing the main aircrafts of choice 
by most major airlines, B737s and A320s," he said.

Highlight: Low-cost airline caught up in scandal after discovering suspect components during checks
Body
Ryanair has found “fake parts” in two of its aircraft engines during scheduled maintenance checks, becoming the 
latest airline to be impacted by a brewing scandal.
The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been 
removed from the engines, the low-cost carrier’s chief executive Michael O’Leary told Bloomberg News.
It comes as the global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal  that has left airlines and regulators 
scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment.
Aviation regulators have accused an obscure London company called AOG Technics of supplying thousands of 
engine parts with faked certification documents for Airbus and Boeing models, including older-generation 737s used 
by Ryanair.
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are among the carriers reportedly that found suspect 
parts.
The Civil Aviation Authority said in August that it has been investigating the supply of a “large number of suspect 
unapproved parts” through AOG Technics.
Mr O’Leary  said the Irish airline has never conducted business directly with AOG, receiving the component for two 
engines instead via third parties.
He added the carrier remains “largely unaffected” overall by the scandal. 
Airlines were told to check their stocks of spare engine parts after reports around AOG started circulating earlier this 
year, according to Mr O’Leary.
Ryanair finds ‘fake parts’ in aircraft engines
The discovery of so-called fake parts comes after Ryanair was forced to make changes to its winter schedule  after 
Boeing delayed deliveries of aircraft.
The setback prompted Mr O’Leary to say he could scrap future orders if the US aviation giant continued to miss 
delivery targets.
In October, he said: “It is frustrating because the demand for travel is very strong and we think there are a lot of 
competitors who are going to be grounding their aircraft.”
The company said to be at the centre of the scandal, AOG Technics, has been accused by US engine giant 
General Electric and its French business partner Safran of large-scale fraud that they allege has led to fake or old 
parts being falsely installed into more than a hundred engines.
AOG’s founder and owner Jose Zamora Yrala, who founded the business from a rented terraced house in Hove on 
the South Coast, is fighting the allegations.

Elon Musk is willing to go where no business leader has gone before, from mass-producing electric cars to 
developing reusable space rockets. Now he's blazing another trail that most executives avoid: the insult.
Tesla's chief executive told advertisers who have fled his social network X over anti-Semitic content to "Fuck off!" 
on Wednesday in an interview.
Several business communications analysts said they could not recall a similar instance of an executive publicly 
insulting customers. A CEO's job is to make deals, not burn bridges, they noted.
"It's to openly attack your customer. That's more the offense than the language itself," said Andy Challenger, senior 
vice president at outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger Gray & Christmas.
Musk, Tesla and X did not respond to requests for comment.
Instances of business leaders using hostile language-sometimes for emphasis, sometimes to show informality-
appear in several corporate reporting calls.
Last year, European airline Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary lambasted aircraft manufacturer Boeing for delayed 
deliveries.
In 2018, Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn went on a rant against a business unit, saying, among other things, 
that "those bastards right now are scared to death," according to a recording. Famed newspaper owner Sam Zell 
famously told one of his own journalists to "fuck you" in a 2008 exchange.
However, the context of Musk's comment was different, as he was asked about the departure of advertisers from X 
following his endorsement of an anti-Semitic publication. Musk apologized for it and then insulted and dismissed the 
concerns of advertisers leaving the platform.
Scholars who have studied swear words say they can relieve stress, tighten bonds or create a sense of urgency.
But swear words can also convey a lack of respect, leadership ability or control, according to a 2017 paper whose 
authors include Yehuda Baruch, a business professor at the University of Southampton.
Musk's outburst was of the negative kind, Baruch said in an interview.
His insult was "certainly an indicator of loss of temper and loss of control. It doesn't show stress relief. Someone at 
his level should not be using profanity to vent his anger."
Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said swearing 
seemed more common 40 years ago and declined as more women entered the workforce.
Cappelli said Musk wants to see himself as a rock star, not a business leader who needs to consider many 
stakeholders. On the other hand, Musk's enormous wealth allows him to suffer financial setbacks at X.
Elon Musk crosses a new line, now with insults
"The business community can't discipline someone who doesn't mind losing money," Cappelli added.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

institutions that have made significant contributions on advancing environmental issues, by helping Japanese 
businesses create corporate value through business strategies that incorporate environmental considerations. The

A longtime advocate for improving the quality and usefulness of corporate sustainability disclosures, Bloomberg is a 
trusted and reliable source for environmental, social & governance (ESG) data. Bloomberg offers ESG data with 
10+ years of history for more than 11,700 companies in 102 countries, in addition to its proprietary Gender Equality 
Index (GEI) and its quant-driven ESG scores launched in 2020. Moreover, Michael R. Bloomberg is the Chair of the

"We are delighted to receive the coveted Gold Award having just received the Bronze Award in this category last 
year," said Norman Tweeboom, Head of Japan at Bloomberg. "It speaks to our recent efforts to accelerate the 
development of our ESG solutions to help investors create alpha with impact. ESG is a particularly important focus 
for the investment community in forward-looking Japan, the country with the highest number of TCFD-supporting 
companies in the world.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

February 25: Bloomberg Awarded by the Japanese Ministry of Environment for ESG Contributions to Finance
Tokyo, 25 February 2021 - Bloomberg today announced it has won a Gold Award in Financial Services at the

institutions that have made significant contributions on advancing environmental issues, by helping Japanese 
businesses create corporate value through business strategies that incorporate environmental considerations. The

standardized data available to investors - and improving market transparency.
A longtime advocate for improving the quality and usefulness of corporate sustainability disclosures, Bloomberg is a 
trusted and reliable source for environmental, social & governance (ESG) data. Bloomberg offers ESG data with 
10+ years of history for more than 11,700 companies in 102 countries, in addition to its proprietary Gender Equality 
Index (GEI) and its quant-driven ESG scores launched in 2020. Moreover, Michael R. Bloomberg is the Chair of the

"We are delighted to receive the coveted Gold Award having just received the Bronze Award in this category last 
year," said Norman Tweeboom, Head of Japan at Bloomberg. "It speaks to our recent efforts to accelerate the 
development of our ESG solutions to help investors create alpha with impact. ESG is a particularly important focus 
for the investment community in forward-looking Japan, the country with the highest number of TCFD-supporting 
companies in the world.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.

November 21: Galway Bay FM: Petition against telecommunications mast in Kinvara gathers over 700 signatures
December 01, 2023: Eleven electric vehicles added to An Post's Galway fleet
A petition against a telecommunications mast in the seaside village of Kinvara has gathered over 700 signatures.
The mast would be 24m tall and would be located at a site around 200m south of the village.
Despite numerous objections to the plans, Vantage Towers Ltd gained planning approval early last month.
A common argument is that this unsightly tower will have a serious impact on the scenic image of Kinvara as a 
quaint seaside village on the edge of Galway Bay.
It's claimed it'll be extremely prominent in the local skyline, and will be clearly visible from Dunguaire Castle.
Other objections raised issues around public health and the local environment - and some argued the mast isn't 
needed in the first place and could easily be located further south.
But the developer made the case for improved connectivity, and said existing masts in the local area aren't suitable.
An appeal has now been lodged with An Bord Pleanala by local residents, with a decision due in March.
