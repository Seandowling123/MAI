Soaring fuel prices could delay a return to profit for the world's airline industry, its main global body warned 
Monday, as cost-cutting efforts fail to keep pace.
The International Air Transport Association, hosting airline executives at its annual meeting, raised its 2006 net loss 
forecast to $3 billion from $2.2 billion.
Unless the price of oil stops rising, IATA chief Giovanni Bisignani said the sector is unlikely to meet its goal of a 
breakeven performance in 2007 after losing money each uyears since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The slowdown in the industry's recovery after total net losses had fallen steadily to $3.2 billion in 2005 from $13 
billion in 2001 comes despite sustained efforts to control costs.
Over the same period airlines raised their average labor productivity by one-third and slashed sales and distribution 
costs by 10 percent, IATA figures show, helped by the widespread acceptance of Internet booking services and 
paperless tickets.
"Oil is the wild card," Bisignani said Monday. "Prices are racing ahead of efficiency gains and robbing our 
profitability."
The price of oil rose back above $73 a barrel Monday after Iran's supreme leader threatened to disrupt global 
supply if the West punishes Tehran over its nuclear program. Recent kidnappings in Nigeria have also helped to 
keep oil prices high.
The global airline industry posted an operating profit which excludes hefty restructuring charges that result from 
layoffs of $4.3 billion in 2005 and that is expected to rise to $7.0 billion this year.
David Bonderman, chairman of low-cost airline Ryanair and a founding partner of hedge fund Texas Pacific Group, 
said the industry is already reaching the peak of its cycle, whose movements have been "disguised by oil prices."
Oil price surge threatens airline recovery
He cited last year's record sales of 2,140 passenger jets by Airbus and Boeing Co., which have both said they 
expect well below half that combined tally in 2006.
"Today is as good as it gets for the airline industry. It's going to get worse," Bonderman said. "In two years' time, 
everyone will be canceling those airplanes."
Many long-haul carriers have supplemented their ticket prices with fuel surcharges. But these do not pass on the 
full extra cost to passengers, and airline executives said Monday they had reached the limits of the charges they 
could levy without hurting demand.
"The only saving grace is that this is a level playing field for all of us and that the fittest will survive," said Singapore 
Airlines Ltd. CEO Chew Choon Seng.
As airlines look for further cost cuts, IATA reaffirmed its goal of phasing out paper tickets in favor of electronic ones 
by the end of next year, and chided governments for holding up similar moves to cut the paperwork accompanying 
air cargo which accounts for 35 percent of global freight by value.
The transition to so-called e-freight would save $1.2 billion a year, the Geneva-based organization says, and 
eliminate up to 38 paper documents per shipment. But it requires governments to recognize the new electronic 
documentation and customs agencies to be equipped to handle it.
"Not a single government has all the legislation in place to support e-freight," Bisignani said. "In today's Internet 
world, this is an embarrassment."

Travel companies are set to receive a significant boost as hundreds of thousands of fans travel to Germany for the 
World Cup.
Ryanair and EasyJet have been aggressively marketing the event with dedicated World Cup webpages.
"Budget airlines should do especially well out of the tournament," says one analyst. "Fares are expensive and there 
are few seats left."
EasyJet will carry about 250,000 people from the UK to six airports in Germany.
"We find that people generally defer booking travel in June until after the World Cup finishes," adds EasyJet.
"If England get to the final, people who may have chosen to go away will probably stay in the UK. It is difficult to 
predict.
"The travel industry are the only people who want England out in the first round, everybody else wants to be 
dancing in the streets on July 9."
A return ticket to Munich with EasyJet in mid-June costs Pounds 234.
Ryanair, who will fly about 6,000 passengers a day from the UK to seven airports in Germany, has courted 
controversy by offering Germans 100,000 free flights for every goal their team scores against England.
Arriva, the only UK bus and rail company withoperations in Germany, is putting on extra trains for fans and 
transporting players around. Tour operators such as Lastminute.com, Thomson and MyTravel have had to cut their 
prices as holidaymakers hold off going abroad until the end of the tournament.
Bookmakers such asGala Coral, Ladbrokes andWilliam Hill are also readying for the start of the single biggest 
sports betting event.
 Budget airlines to net the most TRAVEL & LEISURE
These companies are well-positioned to benefit from the World Cup with the advent of longer opening hours, 
internet betting and a wider range of bets.
David Harding, chief executive of William Hill, said he expected punters to stake Pounds 100m in World Cup-related 
bets at William Hill.
Ironically, the worst possible outcome for the UK industry would be an England victory as the national team are 
heavily backed.
An England win could see an expensive punter pay-day - bookies could have to pay out up to Pounds 50m.
If England get knocked out early, betting interest could also drop off. Joseph Thomas, analyst at Investec, said: 
"Actually, the worst possible outcome would be if Brazil win the World Cup and Ronaldo scores a hat-trick. You 
don't want to see the favourites wining."
During the World Cup, Gala Coral will keep their betting offices open until 10pm and will offer in-running betting, 
which allows customers to bet during matches.
Betfair, the internet betting exchange, predicts a 40-fold increase in active users betting on the 2006 World Cup 
compared with the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea.
The group allows punters to set their own odds and takes a commission from bets matched on its exchange. Unlike 
bookmakers, Betfair's income does not suffer when favourites win. This means it can only benefit from the betting 
frenzy that the World Cup is expected to generate.

The Commercial Court of Paris has ordered Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair to pay damages of $320,000 to Air 
France-KLM for an advertising campaign that claimed Ryanair was 391% cheaper than Air France-KLM. The 
campaign was deemed to be misleading by the court.  Ryanair, meanwhile, has filed a complaint with the European 
Commission, alleging that the French government gave $1.3 billion of illegal state-aid to Air France. 
Ryanair alleges that the French government maintains an airport fees system that makes landing and passenger 
charges for domestic routes up to 50% lower than on international routes within the European Union, which 
allegedly gives Air France-KLM an unfair price advantage at the expense of competitors.

Aer Lingus, the Irish state-owned flag carrier, is leaving the Oneworld global airline alliance in response to the 
growing divergence between its low-fares point-to-point business model and thenetwork strategies of itsalliance 
partners.
It is also facing increasing costs of compliance with the obligations of membership of Oneworld, which is led by 
British Airways, American Airlines, Qantas and Cathay Pacific, as the alliance is expanding quickly.
Next year, Japan Airlines, Royal Jordanian and Malev Hungarian are all due to join Oneworld, triggering a sharp 
rise in IT costs for integrating the computer systems of the new members.
Oneworld is also in discussions with other potential members as it seeks to expand most urgently into China and 
India and to broaden its presence in Latin America. Both China Eastern and Mexicana are seen as potential future 
recruits to the alliance.
Aer Lingus joined the alliance in 2000 when it was still a full-service carrier with an important focus on business 
travellers and connecting traffic.
Since the depth of the aviation crisis in 2001 it has reinvented itself, however, as a low-fares airline imitating many 
features of the low-cost carrier business model. It has sought to compete head on with Ireland's Ryanair, the 
leading European low-cost airline.
Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, said yesterday that alliance membership had "inevitably become less 
relevant for the airline over time". Its future emphasis would be to continue to expand its range of both short and 
long-haul destinations out of Ireland.
It recently added Dubai to its long-haul network but further growth is dependent on the success of the airline's 
planned partial privatisation and the injection of new capital through an initial public offering.
The airline is still innegotiations with trade unions over pensions and job security but Mr Mannion said yesterday 
that the IPO could be completed during September.

He said Aer Lingus was in negotiations with its most important Oneworld partners led by BA and American Airlines 
to try to secure strong bilateral relationships outside the alliance.

Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, is likely to be privatized in September in a long-awaited move, its chief 
executive said Tuesday.
"We are continuing to aim for a transaction in September, and we're moving ahead with the documentation 
necessary to achieve it," Dermot Mannion said.
Mannion said recent volatility in the stock market, and the unprecedented high cost of aviation fuel, would not delay 
the expected flotation on the Irish Stock Exchange.
"The important point is we believe we have a very robust business case that will be attractive for national and 
international investors. We are the most efficient state carrier in Europe. We're operating in the most competitive 
market in the world for airfares. I believe the transaction will complete in September," he said.
Aer Lingus is one of Europe's rare success stories among state-owned airlines. It came close to bankruptcy in 
2002, but rebounded strongly by slashing its payroll in half, shifting ticket sales to the Internet, and developing a 
network of short-haul destinations to continental Europe essentially copying the winning formula of its Dublin-based 
rival, Ryanair.
But Aer Lingus directors argue that the airline would fare better in private hands, because European Union 
competition rules heavily restrict the ability of Ireland to invest taxpayer money in new aircraft. The airline in 
particular wants to buy new long-haul Boeing or Airbus aircraft to expand its route network to the United States and, 
possibly, Asia.
The government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has spent the past five years debating when, and how, to sell off 
Aer Lingus. Earlier this year, Ahern said the government wanted to proceed sometime this year, and signaled that a 
stock flotation, rather than a sale to a group of private investors, was the government's preferred option. In a bid to 
reassure union leaders, Ahern said the government would retain a sufficiently large percentage of ownership to 
block any sale to a foreign company.
AP NewsBreak: Aer Lingus chief says airline likely to be privatized in September
Aer Lingus also announced Tuesday it planned to end its membership in the eight-airline Oneworld alliance by early 
next year. The alliance, formed in 1999, allows participating airlines to share flight codes for joint ticketing and its 
customers to collect frequent-flyer miles on all alliance flights.
Aer Lingus said it did not want to invest an estimated €2 million (US$2.6 million) in upgrading its computer systems 
to handle a growing Oneworld record-keeping burden when the alliance admits three new members Japan Airlines, 
Malev Hungarian Airlines and Royal Jordanian by 2007.
Mannion said Aer Lingus was interested in negotiating individual code-sharing and frequent-flyer agreements with 
its most logical partners, such as British Airways and American Airlines, but saw little benefit in cooperating with 
airlines distant from core Aer Lingus services. He said only 6 percent of Aer Lingus customers were buying tickets 
with connections onto other Oneworld alliance airlines.
"Now is the right time to make the break and go forward with bilateral relations," Mannion said.

 Break-up of BAA monopoly would spark competition

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, As the largest scheduled passenger airline operating to/from the UK, Ryanair warmly welcomes the proposed 
Office of Fair Trading investigation into the BAA airport monopoly. We have long campaigned for the break-up of 
the BAA airport monopoly, which would allow the three main London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) to 
compete against each other.
The break-up of the monopoly would eliminate the waste and inefficiency that is hidden in BAA's current overheads. 
To have spent Pounds 15m to date in defending the hostile takeover or to have spent Pounds 25m (as BAA 
Stansted has) on consultants' reports without producing even one page of a report, is just the latest examples of 
this waste.
The future of London's airport infrastructure should not be allocated to a gold-plating, over-charging monopoly like 
the BAA which is pushing ahead with plans to spend Pounds 4bn on a second runway and terminal at Stansted 
when the majority of airline users there oppose this gold-plating, believing that these facilities can be built for 
Pounds 1bn instead.
Isn't it interesting that this monopoly has now promised its shareholders a 40 per cent increase in dividends and a 
Pounds 750m bonus if the Ferrovial takeover bid is defeated. This sudden largesse, when three months ago it was 
claiming it could not afford to build a second runway at Stansted without a doubling of passenger charges shows 
just how much featherbedding this Golden Goose has been engaged in at the expense of its airline customers and 
passengers.
Competition will deliver better facilities and lower prices for passengers. Preserving the anti-consumer BAA airport 
monopoly will not. God speed to the OFT.

Chief Executive,

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, is making the most concerted drive yet by a European airline into Morocco.
It has signed a five-year deal with the Moroccan government to develop a network of routes from its bases around 
Europe to most of the regional airports in Morocco.
The airline, the leading European low-cost carrier, is already opening five routes to Morocco in November and 
under the agreement will expand this to up to 20 routes carrying close to 1m passengers a year within five years.

Just as the bidding battle for BAA was hotting up, the Office of Fair Trading yesterday dropped a bombshell by 
announcing a possible investigation into whether the airports group's particular monopoly hold over London airports 
"works well for consumers". This news certainly complicates the hostile bid for BAA by Spain's Ferrovial group, 
though it is hard to know which side it might help most. At this stage it seems best to discount any conspiracy 
theory that British officialdom is intervening two days after the European Commission cleared the bid in order to 
thwart the Spanish raiders, and accept the OFT explanation that it had to rush to declare its investigative interest in 
the sector now so as not to falsify the bidding process.
But, however oddly timed, the investigation would be welcome. For the airport sector is very important to the 
economy. BAA is the dominant actor in it, with its airports handling more than 90 per cent of passengers passing 
through London. And it is now 20 years since privatisation created this structure. During that period there have been 
several inquiries into the possible break-up of BAA, but the last one was five years ago and aviation has developed 
fast since then.
There are two main arguments in favour of the status quo. One is the scale and balance sheet of BAA, the world's 
largest airports operator, which is committed to a Pounds 10bn UK investment programme over the next decade. 
Breaking the group up would disrupt this programme, and could lead to cost duplication and higher charges for 
airlines and therefore their passengers. Interestingly, the Competition Commission, the body the OFT serves, 
commented in 2002 that a break-up could become an issue "once plans have been settled for runway expansion". 
The second argument is that the difficulty of increasing capacity in the crowded south-east, with environmental 
constraints at Heathrow and legal ones at Gatwick, make the idea of expansion through greater competition largely 
theoretical.
Set against this is the complaint that BAA behaves like a typical monopolist in being unresponsive to customer 
needs. This point is made particularly strongly by the two big users of BAA services at Stansted, Ryanair and 
EasyJet. These low-cost carriers, which have expanded enormously during the past five years, complain that BAA 
has made them pay for far fancier facilities at Stansted than they want. A second complaint has been the way a 
monopoly such as BAA is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. The airport group has tended to be allowed the 
Antitrust and airports The OFT inquiry into BAA is oddly timed, but still warranted
same return on investment wherever it takes place, reducing incentives to put investment where demand is 
strongest.
If it pursues its investigation, the OFT might want to steer between status quo and break-up, and recommend 
regulatory changes that would improve BAA, whoever owns it by then.

Ryanair, the no- frills airline, has welcomed the British Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) statement that it may look into 
the UK airports market with a view to establishing whether the current structure works well for consumers.
Ryanair and other airlines have been calling for the break up of "this inefficient gold-plating, over-charging 
monopoly".
Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O' Leary said, " When a Government protected monopoly like the BAA can 
spend £4bn building facilities at Stansted which should only cost £1bn, something is wrong. When as part of this 
process the BAA at Stansted can spend £25m on consultants' reports without producing even one page of a report, 
something is very wrong. When the BAA monopoly offers a sweetener of £750m to its shareholders to reject 
Ferrovial's bid, it clearly proves that this monopoly has been overcharging passengers and feathering its own nest."

Body
Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, has been criticised by the UK advertising regulator over its advertisements for millions 
of 'free' flights.
The airline's national press advert breached the code's rules relating to truthfulness, the Advertising Standard 
Authority said.
Its offer of "three million £0 tickets - just pay your taxes and charges" did not apply to flights on Fridays or at certain 
times on other days.
 But the advert failed to make this clear, with small print stating only that the offer "... excludes travel for major 
sporting events and holiday periods". The offer was only available on flights between noon on Mondays and noon 
on Thursdays and only after midday on Saturdays. It did not apply on Fridays. "We concluded that the ad was 
misleading and told Ryanair to make clear all significant exclusions to offers in the small print of future advertising," 
after an investigation, the ASA said. Ryanair said the advert was not misleading because it made clear that the offer 
excluded major sporting events and holiday periods. The advert also directed customers to the airline's website, 
where all the terms and exclusions were explained, the airline said.

CAE Inc., which develops simulation and modeling technologies for civil aviation and military customers, said Friday 
it received contracts totaling about $43 million from Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., ATR and Ryanair for simulation 
equipment and training services.
CAE will provide three full-flight simulators, visual systems, training devices, updates and pilot provisioning 
services. The simulators will be the Montreal-based company's first orders for fiscal year 2007.
Under its deal with Cathay Pacific, a Hong Kong carrier, CAE will provide a Boeing 777-300ER full-flight simulator, 
some other flight training devices and an update to an existing simulator. The simulator and some trainers will head 
to a Cathay Pacific facility in Hong Kong starting next fall.
Toulouse, France-based aircraft manufacturer ATR will receive an ATR72-500 full-flight simulator, two CAE Tropos 
visual systems and an upgrade to the visual system of an existing simulator. The simulator is set to be delivered to 
low-cost Indian carrier Air Deccan in the spring of 2008.
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC exercised an option on a July 2002 agreement for a CAE-built Boeing 
737-800 full-flight simulator. It is expected to be delivered to a Ryanair training facility in the United Kingdom by next 
fall.
The carrier also renewed a pilot provisioning deal with CAE. Under the terms of the agreement, CAE's Amsterdam, 
Netherlands, training center will recruit and train more than 100 Boeing 737-type rated pilots for the airline this year.

British Airways PLC reported a leap in fourth-quarter profit Friday after higher ticket prices and demand for flights 
outweighed a sharply higher fuel bill. Shares in the carrier soared as it also raised its revenue guidance for the 
current financial year.
BA said net profit for the three months to March 31 came to 80 million pounds ($151 million) from just 1 million 
pounds a year earlier.
The airline's pretax profit for the quarter of 91 million pounds ($171 million) was well ahead of the 51 million pounds 
($96 million) expected by analysts.
Revenue rose 13 percent to 2.1 billion pounds ($4 billion) on higher-margin premium traffic and ticket surcharges.
Investors responded positively, sending the airlines shares up 9.1 percent to close at 349.25 pence ($6.60) on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive, called them "good results," but warned that the company faces 
challenges with fuel and staff costs.
However, the airline raised revenue guidance for the year ending March 31, 2007, to a 5 percent to 6 percent 
increase from the previous estimate of 4 percent to 5 percent. The airline said the rise was due to the impact of the 
latest fuel surcharges and filling more seats.
BA has joined several of the other full-cost airlines in increasing fuel surcharges on passenger tickets in recent 
months as the price of crude oil has climbed. Several low-cost carriers that compete with BA on short haul routes, 
such as easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC, have built marketing campaigns out of refusing to do so.
Walsh said that BA has around 58 percent of its fuel requirement for this financial year hedged at $57 a barrel on 
average.
British Airways reports jump in profit as revenue gain outweighs fuel costs
For the full year through March, BA said profit rose to 451 million pounds ($849 million) from 377 million pounds, an 
increase of 20 percent. Annual revenue rose 9.6 percent to 8.5 billion pounds ($16 billion) from 7.8 billion pounds in 
the previous fiscal year.
The company said its planes flew with fewer empty seats and that it improved its operating margin, even though its 
fuel bill rose by 44.7 percent and employee costs were up 5 percent.
The company said it remains committed to reaching an annual 10 percent operating margin by March 2008 and the 
carrier's shorthaul business is now in profit for the first time in 10 years.
Earnings were also boosted by a one-time gain of 26 million pounds ($49 million) from selling a stake in the London 
Eye Co. in February.
However, BA said that while full-year revenue from its longer-haul passenger business rose, its regional airline 
business, dubbed BA Connect, suffered from "significant competitive pressures."
BA Connect slashed its operating costs by more than 10 percent, but not enough to fully offset the lower revenue, 
the company said.
In April, British Airways slashed short-haul fares on dozens of routes by as much as 50 percent in a bid to win back 
passengers from rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet.
BA said that staff will share in a 48 million pound ($90 million) bonus from the profit rise, but added that its pensions 
deficit continued to rise and now stood at 2.1 billion pounds ($3.9 billion).

European equities suffered their worst one-day fall in 3 1/2 years yesterday after inflationary fears returned to haunt 
commodities and stock markets for the second time this week.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 dropped 2.8 per cent to 1,310.01.
In spite of a late rally for the US dollar, exporters most exposed to the currency's weakness suffered most. In the 
car sector, Germany's BMW fell 4.9 per cent to Euros 39 and DaimlerChrysler dropped 4.2 per cent to Euros 39.88, 
hit also by concerns about the possible impact of higher US interest rates on their American sales. Swedish 
truckmaker Scania fell 4.7 per cent to SKr313.50 in spite of a confident sales outlook from the company's head of 
sales.
Austria's OMV was the poorest performer in a weak oil sector, down 5.8 per cent at Euros 42.51, with Finland's 
Neste Oil off 4.3 per cent to Euros 25.27. ING said it was maintaining its "overweight" rating on the sector and stuck 
with Total as its top pick with a Euros 305 target price. However, Total shares fell 3.1 per cent to Euros 210.
Vivendi, the embattled French media company, continued to reject moves aimed at breaking up the company after 
reporting a better-than- expected 10.9 per cent rise in first-quarter core profit. The company also raised its full-year 
forecast for net adjusted profit growth to16 per cent, up from 11-13 per cent.
The company, which owns France's second-largest mobile telecommunications operator SFR, a long-time target of 
the UK's Vodafone, rejected calls from Alexander Vik, Vivendi's largest single shareholder, to break up. The shares 
were unableto maintain early gains and slipped 0.2 per centto Euros 27.75.
EADS, the aerospace group, gained 0.3 per cent to Euros 27.80 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to "buy" 
from "hold" on valuation grounds. The broker was cautious on the potential upside for the stock, however, as it cut 
its target price to Euros 33 from Euros 34.50. Credit Suisse went further, reiterating its "underperform" rating as it 
considered likely "hits" to the stock in the coming months. These included the possibility of overpaying for the 
buyout of BAE-held minorities in Airbus and the impact of dollar weakness, since most of its revenues are dollar-
denominated.
 Exporters suffer in heavy falls EUROPE
Ryanair, the Dublin-listed budget airline, climbed 2.1 per cent to Euros 6.91 after Morgan Stanley raised its 
recommendation from "equal weight" to "overweight".
The broker said investors were overestimating the impact of rising fuel prices. "The fuel cost risk has been offset by 
strong unit cost reductions across the rest of the business," said analyst Penelope Butcher. "We think the market 
should focus on this area in the longer term."

Aer Rianta International, the overseas arm of the Dublin Airport Authority, has been confirmed as one of the parties 
that has won a tender to redevelop and manage two Cypriot airports.
The E622m contract has been awarded to a consortium called Hermes Airports, a company which Aer Rianta 
International is understood to have an 11pc stake in.
The DAA arm will be responsible for all the retailing activities to be based at the two airports - Larnaca and Paphos. 
The contract was signed yesterday and could be worth up to E62m for Aer Rianta, according to the Irish Times.
 Aer Rianta also has duty-free and retail operations in Moscow, St Petersburg, Bahrain, Delaware, Kosovo, Kiev 
and Montreal. Its operations contributed a profit of E17.4m to the DAA in 2005. The overseas operations of the 
company have long been a source of pride for staff, but airlines like Ryanair have called for the assets to be sold 
off. The consortium also involves French construction group Bouygues and engineering firm Egis Projects, and 
Cypriot builder and engineer Charilaos Apostolides. The consortium has been asked effectively to demolish large 
sections of the existing airports and build new modern facilities. The consortium will also manage the airports on 
behalf of the Cypriot government, which will take them back into public ownership in 25 years.

Ireland's property boom helped lift pre-tax profits by 39 per cent at DCC, the diversified industrial holding company.
Profits for the year to March 31 rose from Euros 100.9m to Euros 138m (Pounds 94m). The contribution from Manor 
Park, the Irish housebuilder in which DCC has a 49 per cent stake, went up 52 per cent from Euros 16.8m to Euros 
25.5m. But DCC warned that the results for the housebuilding business would be "materially less" in the current 
year due to planning delays.
Of its five main business divisions, energy, which accounts for nearly half of group profits, achieved a 9 per cent 
increase to Euros 56m. Sercom, its troubled IT distribution business, said it had "a much improved second half" 
following the launch of the Xbox 360 games console, with operating profits up 22 per cent compared with a 37 per 
cent fall in the first six months.
Acquisitions at the healthcare business, which includes medical equipment and diet supplement products, led to a 
41 per cent rise in operating profits to Euros 21.6m.
In food and beverages, the laggard in recent years, operating profits were ahead by a fifth to Euros 15.5m. Tighter 
margins held back the environmental division, where operating profits were up just 1.2 per cent at Euros 5.5m.
The company also said it had taken a 50 per cent stake in William Tracey, a Scottish recycling and waste 
management business, for Euros 23.9m.
A final dividend of 27.31 cents lifts the full-year pay out 15 per cent to 42.85 cents, which will be paid out of 
earnings of 153.9 cents, against 107 cents in 2005.
FT Comment
*DCC's conglomerate model may be out of fashion, but it has proved a better investment over five years than most 
Irish financial stocks, or Ireland's better-known companies such as Ryanair and CRH. By not overpaying for 
UK AND IRELAND : Ireland 's property boom keeps DCC in robust health SUPPORT SERVICES
acquisitions, and focusing on tight cash management, it has consistently achieved a return on equity of close to 20 
per cent since it floated in 1994. The housing boom may have flattered the latest results. Three of the five main 
divisions are reporting good growth, and IT is showing signs of recovery. With earnings forecast at 150 cents, DCC 
is on a p/e of about 13 times. This looks inexpensive.

Ryanair and EasyJet, the two leading European low-cost airlines, are running into increasing obstacles from the 
French and Italian authorities as they look to expand their presence in southern Europe.
Ryanair, the Irish no-frills operator, yesterday lodged a complaint with the European Commission against the 
French government and Air France over what it claimed was Euros 1bn (Pounds 687m) of illegal state aid received 
by the French airline since 1993.
The action came a day after Ryanair, which carried 35.6m passengers in the 12 months to the end of April, 
announced that it was opening its first operating base in France at Marseille, which will be its 16th base in Europe, 
as it widens its attack on the European aviation market.
The airline claimed in its complaint to the Commission that the French government had maintained an airport 
charging system where landing and passenger charges for domestic routes were often up to 50 per cent lower than 
on routes between France and other European Union member states.
Ryanair said the practice was illegal under European law and said the Commission had sued other governments for 
such discriminatory charging.
Air France claimed that the action was "yet again a publicity stunt by Ryanair".
All airlines, including low-cost airlines, on French territory received equal treatment and paid the same taxesand 
charges, Air France added. Contrary to the Ryanair claim, landing charges were the same for all types of flights and 
it was only passenger charges that differed between domestic and intra-European flights, it said.
EasyJet has been fighting a long-standing battle with the French authorities to gain a greater share of the take-off 
and landing slots at Paris Orly airport, where it has established one of its 16 European bases and is pursuing a 
court case against Cohor, the French slot co-ordinator, alleging that it was not independent of the French 
government and was discriminating in favour of Air France.

Both low-cost carriers are expecting verdicts in Italy today in cases where they claim that Enac, the Italian civil 
aviation authority, has effectively blocked them from flying on some domestic routes from Rome and Milan to 
Sardinia by favouring the domestic Italian carriers, Meridiana and Air One, with exclusive route rights under public 
service obligations.

Air Berlin, Germany's largest discount airline, had a rough take-off yesterday, raising Euros 235m (Dollars 302m) in 
its initial public offering but seeing its shares fall more than 8 per cent on the day to close below their offering price, 
reports Andrew Wallmeyer in Frankfurt.
The company has said it will use the cash to purchase additional aircraft and expand some of its routes, specifically 
in eastern Europe, where it is battling larger rivals EasyJet and Ryanair.
Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin founder and chief executive, told German television network N24 he was "very pleased" 
with the offering, though it brought in significantly less than the Euros 350m the company had been targeting as 
recently as April.
Shares opened yesterday morning at Euros 12.65 before falling to Euros 11.25 at the close of trading. Their initial 
price was set late on Wednesday at Euros 12.
Air Berlin's lacklustre opening-day performance was the latest in a line of disappointments for the airline, which is 
Germany's second-largest behind Lufthansa, selling 13.5m tickets in 2005.
Last week the company delayed its IPO from May 5 and cut its target price range from Euros 15-Euros 17.50 a 
share to Euros 11.50-Euros 14 a share after investors complained that its initial range was unreasonably high.
In 2005, Air Berlin recorded a loss of Euros 116m on revenue of Euros 1.22bn. The year before the carrier posted a 
Euros 3m loss on revenue of Euros 1.03bn.
"It was a difficult birth,
but they often produce the happiest children," noted Dirk Notheis, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, which 
along with Commerzbank led the offering.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said it will appeal to the European courts the decision of Italy's regional 
administrative court of Lazio to stop Ryanair and Easyjet's flights on routes between mainland Italy and Sardinia.
Ryanair said the Italian authorities blocked Ryanair's flights between Rome and Alghero by imposing a Public 
Service Obligation on the route despite the fact that 2 airlines (Ryanair and Airone) were already operating year 
round flights between Rome and Alghero.
"The PSO system in Europe is clearly out of control. It is being abused by national governments to protect high fare 
flag carriers while at the same time blocking low fare competition," Ryanair said in a statement to the Irish Stock

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC lodged a complaint with the European Commission on Thursday against 
Air France, alleging that the French carrier has received around 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in illegal state aid over 
the past few years.
Ryanair accused the French government of maintaining an airport fees system that makes landing and passenger 
charges for domestic routes up to 50 percent lower than on international routes within the European Union.
The airline said the system gave Air France an unfair price advantage, or the equivalent of around 1 billion euros 
($1.3 billion) in state aid, at the expense of competitors.
"Air France has a rampant monopoly in the French market and this dominance has been enhanced by the illegal 
airport charging system that has been maintained in France, despite rulings by the European Commission in other 
EU member states," Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs Jim Callaghan said.
"These substantially lower charges on domestic French routes, on which Air France has an almost complete 
monopoly, have allowed them to make super profits on domestic routes and to cross subsidize their international 
routes, on which they compete with airlines like Ryanair."
The airline said it wants the European Commission to force the French government to change its charging system 
and to compel Air France to return the savings it has made from the system.
Low-cost airlines have long-complained about government subsidies to established carriers in Europe.
The European Union last month warned Greece it would face fines if it does not recover 161 million euros ($205.7 
million) in illegal aid to Olympic Airways. The EU first ordered Greece to recover the money in 2002 after ruling that 
the aid granted between 1998 and 2002 infringed on an agreement on state aid to the struggling carrier.
Ryanair shares closed 0.6 percent lower at 6.80 euros ($8.70) on the London Stock Exchange.

Air France said that only passenger duties were levied differently for domestic and international flights while 
contrary to Ryanair's claims landing fees were the same.
"Ryanair is pulling a publicity stunt," Air France spokeswoman Véronique Brachet said. "In fact, airlines operating in 
France receive complete equality of treatment."
Low-cost airlines have long-complained about government subsidies to established carriers in Europe.
Ryanair files complaint with EU about state funding granted to Air France
The European Union last month warned Greece it would face fines if it does not recover €161 million (US$205.7 
million) in illegal aid to Olympic Airways. The EU first ordered Greece to recover the money in 2002 after ruling that 
the aid granted between 1998 and 2002 infringed on an agreement on state aid to the struggling carrier.
However, Ryanair has also fallen foul of the strict EU aid rules. In 2004, it was ordered to pay back €4 million in 
illegal aid from a Belgian regional government.
Ryanair shares were 0.6 percent lower at €6.80 (US$8.70) in afternoon trade on the London Stock Exchange.

The Dublin market slipped back further this morning as investors took profits from United Drug after the 
pharmaceutical wholesaler reported a 14pc increase in trading profit for the six months to 31 March 2006.
By 1200 the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 13.57 to 7945.29.
Shares in United Drug fell back in early trading with investors taking profits after the company announced that group 
revenue was up from E634m to E708m, an increase of 12pc, while pre-tax profits were up 15pc, from E22m to 
E25.3m. United Drug stocks were 5c lower on 3.85.
 The board said each of the group's four divisions - Pharma Wholesale, Contract Distribution Outsourcing, Medical 
and Scientific and Contract Sales Outsourcing, performed strongly in the period. Chief executive Liam FitzGerald 
said: "The first six months of our 2006 year has seen a continuation of our track record of delivering double-digit 
profit and earnings growth." Meanwhile, Fyffes was the biggest faller in early trading, losing a whopping 43c 
(21.2pc) to E1.60. Elsewhere, it proved a mixed morning for the financials as AIB slipped 1c to 18.72, while Bank of 
Ireland climbed 5c to 14.65. Anglo Irish Bank enjoyed a better morning after its stock price fell by 28c to 1347 
yesterday on profit taking. The bank led yesterday's fallers following its announcement of a 35pc surge in profits for 
the half year thanks to strong economic conditions here and in the UK and booming demand for loans. Construction 
stocks also suffered a mixed morning as CRH stocks gained 15c to 28.83 but others fell back. Shares in CRH 
bounced back today after Goodbody Stockbrokers yesterday noted that with most major US housebuilding firms 
having reported first quarter results, one common theme emerging is that, while current activity levels remain 
strong, order books are weakening. It noted that the cumulative level of new orders are down 7pc. CRH derives 
more than 50pc of its total revenues from the US. Stock in CRH closed down 18c to 2867 yesterday. It was not 
such a good morning for other construction stocks however as Kingspan fell 8c to 13.80 and Grafton slipped 5c to 
11.03. McInerney was flat at 13.00. Elsewhere on the market this morning, Ryanair slipped back 3c to 6.82 
following news yesterday evening that it was to make the southern French city of Marseille its 16th European base.

A poor performance from Fyffes dragged the Irish stock market lower yesterday as the fruit company continued to 
take a hit after announcing plans on Tuesday to spin off its property assets into a separately listed company.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 71.60 on 7887.26.
Europe's biggest importer and distributor of fruit and vegetables, dropped a whopping 49 cents, or 24pc, to close on 
1.54.
 At an EGM on Tuesday, Fyffes investors approved a plan to transfer almost E200 worth of real estate to a new 
company, Blackrock International Land Plc. Fyffes will transfer most of its property portfolio to Blackrock in 
exchange for a one-for-one issue of Blackrock shares to Fyffes' shareholders. Fyffes shareholders will have a 60pc 
stake in Blackrock, with Fyffes holding the remainder. Blackrock shares are scheduled to begin trading in Dublin 
and on Monday, with the spin-off set to reduce Fyffes' profit by 80c per share. The financials also had a tough day 
as shareholders in Anglo Irish Bank continued to plunder profits. The bank announced on Wednesday that profits 
had surged by 35pc during the first half of the year. Anglo shares fell 32c to 13.55 yesterday. Elan was another big 
faller, down 48c to 11.26. Elsewhere in the sector, AIB shares were down 18c to 18.55, while Bank of Ireland 
declined 15c to 14.45. Shares in United Drug climbed over 5c to 3.95 after the pharmaceutical wholesaler reported 
a 14pc increase in trading profit for the six months to 31 March 2006. In the construction sector, McInerney stocks 
continued to perform well after the group said on Wednesday that it sees robust growth in demand, growth and 
profits in 2006. McInerney shares climbed 7c to 13.07. Elsewhere in the sector CRH fell 12c to 28.56 on profit 
taking. Shares in Ryanair fell 4c to 6.81 after the airline confirmed it had submitted a complaint to the EU against Air 
France. It alleges that the French airline has received around E1bn in illegal state aid from the French Government 
over the past few years.

Profit taking on Kingspan shares following confirmation of rumours that it is considering a major acquisition helped

At the close, the ISEQ was down 9.17 points to 7,987.75.
Building materials, insulation and timber frame homes firm, Kingspan, led the decline with shares down 26c to 1365 
after it confirmed that that it is in talks to acquire the Irish and UK based rigid insulation board manufacturer 
Hytherm/Xtratherm Group. Investors, spurred by weekend reports that it was about to make the purchase for 
around E85m, had already factored in the news to the share price and took the opportunity to take profits.
 Ryanair was another weight on the index as investors took notice of chief executive, Michael O'Leary's comments 
that rising oil prices will hurt the company's bottom line but that, should crude prices rise as high as USD100 per 
barrel, Ryanair would be 'the only survivor'. Shares dropped 18c to 682.

A job advertisement from Ryanair seeking "a young" and "dynamic" professional triggered one of the celebrated 
employment cases brought by the Irish Equality Authority.
Ryanair argued the use of the word "young" in the advertisement in The Irish Times was not used in an age context 
but was intended to convey enthusiasm, passion and ambition of somebody who was "dynamic". The airline, 
however, was ordered to pay IPounds 8,000 to the EA in 2001, carry out a review of its equal opportunities policies, 
introduce procedures to "equality proof" future recruitment advertisements and promotions and publish a statement 
making clear its commitment to equal opportunities in The Irish Times.
The case, while providing some amusement, illustrated the cost in management time and embarrassment of failing 
to comply with age discrimination legislation, even if the actual fine was small by comparison with the size of the 
company.
Acas, the employment relations and arbitration organisation, warned last month that 80 per cent of employers were 
unprepared for the introduction of age discrimination laws in Britain this October.
The Irish experience rev-eals that it not just over the wording of job advertisements where companies have to be 
careful. A 48-year-old teacher applying for the position of deputy principal at St Gabriel's School complained after 
the post was given to a younger teacher with just seven years' experience. The school was required to pay Euros 
5,000 after the equality officer ruled that the older teacher had been discriminated against at the job interview when 
he was questioned why after 27 years "he should be bothered with the hassle of the job of deputy principal", said 
Paul Glenfield head of employment, pensions and benefit law at Dublin solicitor Matheson Ormsby Prentice.
In a similar case a teacher pursuing a permanent post complained she was asked her date of birth and the year she 
qualified. The job interviewer said that knowing an applicant's age helped to determine what questions to ask and 
that people of different ages might be asked different questions.
Personnel pitfalls result in payouts Andrew Taylor looks at cases that show how focusing on youth or maturity 
can be costly
The school was ordered to hold the job competition again, introduce training for personnel involved with staff 
selection and appoint an interview board. "We tell clients it is much safer not to ask question about a person's age 
on application forms and at interviews," said Mr Glenfield.
Companies should also check that investigations arising from a complaint do not reveal that appointments have 
been weighted towards certain age groups, he said. A complainant won Euros 40,000 for failing to win promotion to 
principal officer at the Department of Health and Children after it was discovered the department had not appointed 
a candidate aged over 50 to principal or assistant principal officer in more than three years.
In another case an accountant with 20 years experience was rejected for being "too senior". The employer said it 
wanted people who had been qualified for two or three years. The complainant successfully argued this "effectively 
excluded most candidates aged over 30", said Mr Glenfeld. Conversely a complaint was held against the Irish 
Department of Finance, which wanted at least five years' service before an individual could be considered for 
promotion to higher executive officer. It was ruled this discriminated against candidates under 30.

Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, today said the airline might feel the impact from continually rising oil 
prices on business and it could see a dip in its margin levels should oil prices remain at record levels.
The profit margin could drop "slightly under the 20pc mark," O'Leary said.
"But even when oil prices climb to above USWD100 a barrel, we will remain profitable - presumably as the only

 Ryanair has not hedged its fuel needs and oil prices have risen from USD60 a barrel a month ago to over USD70 a

Size of flotation scaled back AIR BERLIN

Body
Air Berlin, Europe's third-largest budget airline, stands to raise only about half the money it had hoped to secure 
from its flotation after it cut the size of the share offering.
The German company said yesterday it would lower the range for its book-building debut from Euros 15-Euros 
17.50 to Euros 11.50-Euros 14.50 a share and reduce the share allocation by 15 per cent to 42.5m.
The move follows its decision to postpone the flotation from yesterday until Thursday of next week. It could hamper 
the airline's plans to grow rapidly and challenge market leaders Ryanair and Easyjet, which are more than twice the 
size in terms of passenger numbers.
As a result of the changes, which follow investor scepticism, Air Berlin's share offering could net the company as 
little as Euros 225m (Dollars 287m) compared with the Euros 350m to Euros 410m initially planned for the listing.
The owners could net as little as Euros 284m instead of Euros 460m and keep 29 per cent of shares.
Joachim Hunold, founder and chief executive, said oil price rises had made investors more cautious. Their 
valuations fell as Easyjet and Ryanair shares suffered in recent weeks. "In the end, the pricing was the problem," he 
said.
This leaves Mr Hunold short of the Euros 350m that in April he had stipulated was the minimum needed for Air 
Berlin's expansion plans. The company has 55 new aircraft to finance by 2011 and wants to fly new routes to 
northern and eastern Europe.
The situation is also an embarrassment for lead banks Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley, who until the last 
moment ignored investors' worries about the impact of rising oil prices.
Size of flotation scaled back AIR BERLIN
Investors in Germany have been slow to rediscover a taste for share offers after the technology bubble burst more 
than four years ago. While many offerings have gone well, bankers said that difficulties in getting issues away was 
evidence of acontinuing aversion to risk.

Body
Air Berlin's ambition to take on rival low-cost carriers Ryanair and Easyjet hung in the balance last night, as it 
considered changes to a delayed stock offer in the face of investor scepticism.
Any such move could dash the airline's hopes of raising a minimum Euros 350m (Dollars 444m) to pay for new 
aircraft and cast a pall on the German stock market, which has seen a slow restart to offers after the end of the 
technology boom.
Europe's third-largest budget airline said it was postponing its debut from today to Thursday and consulting 
advisers Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley - possibly to cut the price range from Euros 15-Euros 17.50 per share.
"That's one option they're looking at right now," said a person familiar with the situation after the end of book-
building late yesterday afternoon.
"Obviously things haven't gone quite to plan."
The move followed a raft of analysts' reports that raised questions about the loss-making airline's chances of 
making a profit amid high fuel prices and fierce rivalry on European routes.
Germany's Bankhaus Metzler issued a report valuing the shares at Euros 12 apiece, saying the airline would at 
best break even in 2006. The carrier had hinted it would go into the black this year.
Joachim Hunold, founder and chief executive, said in April that recent restructuring should have a favourable impact 
on the bottom line, and equity analysts at Commerzbank forecast that net profit would hit Euros 51m (Dollars 
64.6m) in 2006.
But in grey market trading ahead of the launch, Air Berlin shares yesterday dipped as low as Euros 13.80 before 
recovering to trade between Euros 14.80 and Euros 15.60, according to specialist brokers Land & Schwarz and 
DKM.
 Air Berlin ponders offer changes
Air Berlin had hoped to raise up to Euros 408m for strategic investments and up to Euros 464m for its seven 
founding owners in an attempt to turn its focus away from its original charter business to low-cost services. The 
company needs the money to help pay for 55 new Airbus aircraft on order until 2011, which will in part replace 56 
existing aircraft.The remainder was earmarked for new routes to Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.
Air Berlin this week said April passenger numbers were 25 per cent up on a year ago.
Mercer Consultants give it a European market share of 8 per cent. Rivals Ryanair and EasyJet each hold at least 
26 per cent.

Air Berlin's challenge to rivals Ryanair and Easyjet in the no-frills airline market remained uncertain last night after 
the German airline postponed its listing on the Frankfurt stock exchange by nearly a week.
The company gave no explanation for the move, which will see its shares begin trading on May 11 instead of 
Friday, as originally planned.
However, traders indicated that investors were being put off by the high price of Air Berlin shares, which has been 
fixed between E15 and E17.50.
 The move is also being seen as a setback for Aer Lingus, which hopes to float on the stock market in the summer. 
Air Berlin said in a statement that it had extended the period during which investors can apply to buy shares to May 
10. The company intends to use the proceeds from its initial public offering to fund expansion in eastern Europe, 
where it faces fierce competition from rivals such as EasyJet and Ryanair.

Body
A new air taxi company being started by Irish financier Domhnal Slattery has placed firm orders for 50 executive 
jets from the Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer.
The financier says that his company JetBird aimed to change the private jet market in the same way that Ryanair 
and its no-frills rivals had brought down the cost of airline travel.
He plans to base the company in Zurich, with clients buying use of the planes by the hour, with a guarantee to fly 
them wherever they want to go.
 According to the Irish Times this morning, Slattery's private investment vehicle Claret Capital has paid a USD5 m 
deposit to Embraer. It will invest USD20 m in early 2008 and an additional USD20 m in 2010. The company aims to 
raise the remaining capital for the business on the long-term debt markets. The company's aim is to prepare the 
business for a stock market flotation in 2013, Mr Slattery said. JetBird has firm orders to buy 50 of the Phenom 100 
aircraft from 2009 - at a cost of USD2.825 m each - and options to acquire another 50 in the five years after that. 
The Irish Times says that, with Switzerland as its hub, the company aims to introduce services at "mini-hubs" in 
Germany, Italy, France and Britain as it receives its full supply of planes.

Plans for a new air taxi company, which claims to apply the low-cost philosophy of Ryanair to the luxury world of 
executive travel, were launched yesterday, writes John Murray Brown.
JetBird, headed by Irishman Domhnal Slattery, has placed an order for 50 executive jets with Embraer, the Brazilian 
aerospace company.
With an option on a further 50, the total order is worth Dollars 280m (Pounds 153m).
Mr Slattery, formerly head of structured asset finance at Royal Bank of Scotland, said JetBird would "certainly be 50 
per cent cheaper" than rival private jet companies such as NetJets and would compete with regular business fares 
on scheduled flights.
Earlier this week, NetJets, part of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway group and the biggest operator of business 
jets in Europe, said it was adding a further 30 aircraft, expanding its fleet by a third to 119 by the end of 2006.
Separately, Air Partner, the world's leading air charter broker, announced it was launching a new jet cardscheme 
where users pre-payfor a number of flyinghours a year on corporatejets.
JetBird's Embraer-made Phenom 100 - unveiled yesterday at the Ebace show in Geneva - is expected to be ready 
for delivery in April 2009.
The venture, which will be based in Zurich, has identified 800 small European airports it will use.
"Our business model is as price-per-hour goes down, revenues go up the more people use the service - it's the 
Ryanair model," says the 39-year-old Mr Slattery, whose first job was at GPA, the aircraft leasing company founded 
and headed by Tony Ryan, who then went on to found Ryanair.

Embraer yesterday secured the first European order for its Phenom business aircraft, highlighting the growing 
appeal of the new breed of very light jets to corporate users and air-taxi companies.
The Brazilian manufacturer plans to launch the four-seat Phenom 100 aircraft in 2008, and is sold out until 2010 
after securing50 firm orders from JetBird, a Geneva-based air-taxi start-up.
Embraer is involved in a four-way tussle for supremacy in the fledgling VLJ market, which relies on new technology 
and lean manufacturing techniques to produce aircraft far cheaper to build and operate than traditional executive 
jets.
Operators plan to maximise the efficiency of the aircraft by flying to smaller, uncongested airports, with passengers 
booking online and sharing aircraft to keep down costs.
Domhnal Slattery, JetBird's founder and chairman, said his operation would "certainly be 50 per cent cheaper" than 
rivalprivate jet companies such as NetJets, and would be competitive with business fares on scheduled flights.
The company aims to start services from Zurich in 2009 and build its fleet to 100 aircraft by 2013, linking 
800destinations.
"Our business model is, as price-per-hour goes down, revenues go up the more people use the service. It's the 
Ryanair model," said Mr Slattery, a former aircraft financier.
The market for larger business jets has rebounded over the past year, with NetJets this week announcing plans to 
boost its European fleet by a third, and manufacturers such as Bombardier and Raytheon planning to lift production 
over the next two years.
The VLJ market is being closely watched because of its impact on traditional executive jets and the premium 
passengers prized by commercial airlines.

Aviation experts said the success of the ventures would hinge on pricing, while others are concerned that the 
introduction of thousands of new aircraft will add to air-traffic congestion and leave the infrastructure unable to 
cope.

The contrast could hardly have been more stark. While BAA was busy trumpeting the value of its London airports 
yesterday in a defence document against the bid from Ferrovial, one of its biggest customers was showing just what 
a slog it is making money flying out of them.
In the circumstances, EasyJet's interim results were pleasingly upbeat. Despite oil prices at Dollars 75 a barrel, the 
low-cost carrier raised its profit forecast for the year and produced a first-half loss that was lower than expectations. 
A heavy reliance on leisure travellers makes for huge seasonal fluctuations, but the underlying business model is 
kept in the air by EasyJet's ability to continue squeezing out costs - down 6.2 per cent yesterday before fuel.
Compare this with the slightly cosier world inhabited by BAA. Yesterday's preliminary defence contained little talk 
about customers - airlines or passengers - but lots of reminders of its protected status as a regulated monopoly. To 
rub salt in the wound, it pointed out its intention to raise landing fees to the maximum permitted level at Stansted - 
where both EasyJet and Ryanair have complained that BAA is over-investing to justify higher regulated prices. It is 
about time the budget airlines started paying their share for new infrastructure investment in Europe, but at least 
they can claim to be operating in a (largely) free market.

Highlight: Ryanair has gone to Court to challenge the introduction of rental charges for check-in desks at Dublin 
airport.
Body
No frills airline Ryanair will return to the High Court today as it continues its challenge against the approval given by 
the Commission for Aviation Regulation for the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) to introduce rental charges for check-
in desks at Dublin Airport.
The DAA is proposing a charge of E64,751 per check-in desk which will include the costs of a computeised check-
in service known as CUTE (common user terminal equipment).
Ryanair claims the proposed charges are excessive and that the decision to approve them, made by the 
commission in December 2004, was arbitrary and unreasonable. The claims are denied, according to a report in the 
Irish Times.
 The case got underway yesterday in the High Court. Ryanair told the court yesterday that it provides its own 
groundhandling services and is a "self-handler" within the provisions of the European communities groundhandling 
regulations, therefore it should not have to pay the fees. Because it does not avail of the CUTE service but instead 
operates a manual check-in system at its own desks, it claims it should not have to pay for the costs of providing 
CUTE. Ryanair contends the commission failed to conduct any proper analysis of the DAA's proposed costs for 
check-in desk rental. The commission's approval decision is not transparent as there was no logical basis for not 
reducing the proposed charge, having extracted the CUTE charge and the argument that the charges were 
discounted was arbitrary, the airline claimed. Ryanair argued that the commission had "unquestioningly" accepted 
the DAA position that there would be no reduction of the rental figure by extracting the costs of CUTE and this 
rendered the charges approval fundamentally flawed. The application resumes today.

Air Berlin's advertisements have been known to feature models in scanty bikinis. The proposed price range for its 
initial public offering is similarly cheeky. Europe's third largest low-cost carrier, which lost Euros 116m last year, 
hopes to raise between Euros 15 and Euros 17.5 a share, or up to Euros 400m, when it floats later this week.
The need for an equity injection is clear. Air Berlin is more highly leveraged than its larger rivals, Ryanair and 
Easyjet, and hopes to use some of the flotation proceeds to pay off debt. It will also buy new planes and add new 
routes. The airline hopes that expansion into Scandinavia and eastern Europe will help offset growing competition 
in its main markets of Germany and Spain.
The strategy is reasonably convincing. So too are Air Berlin's plans to increase revenues from so-called "ancillaries" 
such as car hire or hotel bookings, currently only 3 per cent of sales, compared with 15 per cent at Ryanair and 7 
per cent at Easyjet. Other goals seem less realistic. Like every other carrier, Air Berlin hopes to increase the 
proportion of business travellers using its services, but achieving this will be challenging. Similarly, cutting costs 
could also prove difficult. Air Berlin's non-unionised workforce means labour costs are already less than 10 per cent 
of sales.
Morgan Stanley, one of the IPO co-ordinators, forecasts that Air Berlin will increase earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation and rent from Euros 153m in 2005 to Euros 250m this year. At the low end of the 
proposed price range, this implies an enterprise value to 2006 ebitda of 6.4 times. The discount to Easyjet's 8 times 
seems more than justified.

Singapore-based low-cost carrier Tiger Airways expects to establish an associate airline in another Asian country 
before the end of this year, while also growing its operation at home through the launch of more routes.
Tony Davis, chief executive of the carrier – in which Singapore Airlines holds a 49% stake – says the establishment 
of a second base “will definitely be this year”. Davis has for more than a year been looking to partner with other 
companies to set up an associate carrier in another country and said previously that it will come in 2006 or 2007.
“We have got three more aircraft being delivered before the end of the year that we can use towards the new base 
once we establish that,” says Davis, declining to say where the base may be.
Tiger, as of last week, when it added three new services to southern China, is operating on 16 routes with a fleet of 
six Airbus A320s, two of which have only just been added. It has six more A320s on order. “The only outstanding 
challenge for Tiger now is establishing a base outside Singapore,” says Davis. He adds that the airline will have 20 
routes from Singapore by year-end to points in eight countries and territories.
Other than SIA, the airline is 11%-owned by Singapore government investment arm Temasek Holdings, 24%-
owned by US-based Indigo Partners and 16%-owned by the family of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan.

Body
Ryanair has been fined 70,000 dkr (around E9,400) by the Danish police for misleading advertising involving 
competitor SAS AB, newswire Ritzau's Bureau reported.
According to the newswire report, Ryanair's advertising said: 'SAS claims they have the lowest air prices in Europe 
get at least a 98 pct saving compared with SAS's so-called 'lowest prices'.'
The newswire said consumer affairs ombudsman Hagen Joergensen regarded this claim as misleading, causing 
him to report Ryanair to the police as the advertising did not meet the legal requirements for loyal price 
comparisons.
 At the same time, the advertising brought discredit on a competitor by not giving information about the important 
differences between the flights compared in the advertisement, Joergensen added. The comparison involved prices 
for destinations where SAS had no direct flights, so that passengers would have to fly from Malmoe in Sweden to 
Stockholm in order to fly to London, whereas Ryanair had a direct route from Malmoe to London. The companies' 
pricing was also different, as Ryanair used single tickets, while SAS based its pricing on return tickets, the report 
said.

Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive officer, was quoted in the Prague Post as saying: "There is a lot of talk 
that eastern Europe is the Holy Grail; but talk is all it is." O'Leary seems to have changed his mind because Ryanair 
continues to add routes to the region and each summer it makes a foray into new markets. 
Western European airlines have not lived up to the expectation that they would dominate the central and eastern 
European market. 
"Eastern Europe continues to show strong growth and we have flights from western Europe to eastern Europe. But, 
we do not have many flights coming back to western Europe because of the limited business travel and tourism 
market in the region," says Air Berlin. 
Ryanair and easyJet continue to add new routes to various corners of the central and eastern European region, 
whether it is to Wroclaw in Poland or Split in Croatia. 
Although these airlines clearly recognize the growth potential in the region, their target markets seem to be western 
tourists travelling to eastern Europe. 
They have not aggressively expanded or taken over these markets, as many would have expected. 
"Western European low-costs have embarked on a strategy of considerable growth and they see central and 
eastern Europe as their growth markets," says Hanlon. 
"Growth is dynamic, organic and progressive, and you have to balance it with the timing of other ventures," he 
adds. 
In the continuing battle for the market, only those airlines that can sufficiently understand it and provide low enough 
fares to entice customers, will survive. This is a challenge that some western airlines can withstand and also which 
some have chosen to pull out of. 
What is certain, however, is that this growth will not be sustained at such high rates. It will plateau and the real fight 
for survival will then begin for many airlines.  n

Highlight: For any Irishman, Montreal is a long way away from a true pint of Guinness. But the Canadian city has a 
lot to offer the likes of Brian Dunne, who emigrated from Dublin last year.
Body
When Brian Dunne decided to trade his Dublin climes for new pastures in Montreal, he challenged the temptation of 
sticking with a particular company (and country) for as long as possible. Previously chief financial officer of Aer 
Lingus, Ireland's main carrier, Dunne became executive vice-president and chief financial officer of ACE Aviation 
Holdings, the parent company of Air Canada (the 13th-largest airline in the world) and Jazz (the second-largest 
airline in Canada), which operates about 135 Bombardier aircraft (a combination of jets and turboprop aircraft). ACE 
also owns Air Canada Technical Services, a maintenance, repair and overhaul supplier, and 75% of Aeroplan, 
Canada's leading loyalty programme. 
Dunne assumed oversight of all of these businesses when joining ACE in September 2005. While all this may 
sound challenging for one individual, the role is quite fitting for someone of Dunne's experience: a three-and-a-half-
year tenure as chief financial officer at Aer Lingus was preceded by a stint as a consulting partner at Arthur 
Andersen in Dublin. With a total of 15 years' experience in the aviation industry, Dunne remains attracted to its 
constant evolution. 
"I've had a very productive eight months since arriving at ACE," he says. "For example, we have concluded a very 
substantial aircraft order for 32 firm aircraft for Air Canada, comprising 18 777 aircraft and 14 787 aircraft. We've 
also continued to role out a new revenue model for the airline, which is more flexible and transparent to the 
customer and also includes a range of multi-trip flight passes." 
In addition to facilitating a host of internal developments at ACE, Dunne is steering the company through external 
pressures such as the increasing price of fuel, which has a material impact on the industry and its cost structure. 
Investor confidence 
As investors become increasingly more confident in airlines, reputation will play a key role in further interest. 
"Investors are increasingly focused on the positioning of the airline in question, including where the airline has come 
from, where it is going and the business model it is adopting, how it approaches costs and the top management 
capability required to sustain the business into the future," says Dunne. 
Atlantic Crossing
"Secondly," he adds, "in analyzing the range and mix of investors who are investing, you are seeing a greater 
combination of investors with long-term, medium-term and short-term time horizons. The shareholder back drop is 
changing." 
How low? 
The change in investor profile is also influenced by the emergence of low-cost carriers. Taking into account his 
previous experience, Dunne is no stranger to Europe 's low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, easyJet, AirBerlin and 
SkyEurope. "As I've come to the other side of the Atlantic I've had a good look at the Canadian low-cost players, 
including WestJet, and I've looked more closely at US players, including Southwest and JetBlue," he says. "I've also 
looked at airlines in South America, such as GOL. The impact of LCCs varies according to the relative stage of 
development of the market. Ryanair has probably the purest low-cost model. The real issue for legacy carriers is 
how do you respect but respond to low-cost competition?" 
This respect-and-respond philosophy was clearly demonstrated by Dunne during his time at Aer Lingus. This legacy 
carrier responded to the low-cost airlines by repositioning itself in the market. 
He says: "Air Canada is doing the same with its new revenue model. The impact of the low costs depends on where 
the market is at and where the legacy carriers are at in terms of their development. In the mature markets of Europe 
and the US, legacy carriers are beginning to find ways of responding to low-cost competition and positioning 
themselves to ensure they have a sustainable future. There are other markets that are less developed and low-cost 
players are entering these. If the incumbent legacy carriers have not made any changes to their business model, 
low costs can make substantial inroads into these markets." Deal or no deal 
Decisions about aircraft financings are important for any airline CFO. 
Dunne says: "At the end of the day financing cost is clearly a key driver, followed by loan to value or the amount of 
value that can be drawn down on particular assets. The other key driver is execution or the ability to get a deal done 
on the terms promised. Relationships are also very important, particularly where complex deals are involved." 
In the past few months Air Canada has financed its first 18 Embraer 190 deliveries through a consortium led by 
Royal Bank of Scotland, which also included Halifax Bank of Scotland and DVB. This combination worked well. 
"Clearly, as we look forward to financing the remaining 27 Embraer 190 deliveries and take delivery of the first 777s 
in 2007, we are going to be looking at financing these deliveries at more attractive pricing. But at the end of the day 
it's a combination of pricing, the loan terms we can get and the ability to execute the deal. Relationship plays an 
important part in reaching conclusion on these aspects." New markets 
ACE Aviation Holdings is keeping a watchful eye on budding markets for commercial aviation. Dunne identifies the 
most promising developing markets as India, China, Mexico and Indonesia. 
"There is a huge amount of scale and development potential in India and China," he says. "The opportunity for 
growth is enormous, given the population and the current low levels of air transportation. There is massive potential 
to grow those markets over the next five to 10 years. Clearly, infrastructure, pilot training and other resources will 
have to keep pace. Mexico is a very interesting market." 
The Mexican aviation market comprises six or seven airlines, which have either started or will begin to operate in 
the coming months. Indonesia is showing significant scope for development and a number of players are looking at 
this market. Compared to the mature markets of Europe and North America, these markets are a lot less developed 
and there is considerable potential to grow them and to significantly stimulate demand with low fares." The 
challenges 
Keeping up with the potential of developing markets, creativity and revenue efficiency are two attributes Air Canada 
has done very well from in the past year. 
Atlantic Crossing
"At an industry level, the pending delivery of the first Airbus A380 and the continuing order build of the Boeing 787 
are all very positive developments for the industry," says Dunne. 
While focusing on all of these developments, Dunne regards complacency as a long-lasting enemy. "There are 
plenty of challenges in the shape of fuel prices, avian flu, etc. From our perspective the challenge is to take 
advantage of the opportunities while keeping in mind that it is important to make your business as robust as 
possible as quickly as possible in order to withstand any of the significant challenges that may come over the next 
12 months." 
Whatever the challenges, Dunne and his team have been far from complacent. Since his arrival they have 
completed an initial public offering for Jazz, effectively selling about 20% of the business for about C$250 million 
($225.9 million). 
"We also took a six per cent stake in US Airways in late 2005, and recently sold a portion of this stake at a 
substantial profit to recoup 90% of our original investment. We have appointed a new management team for Air 
Canada Technical Services as we look to highlight and realize the value of that business over the next 12 months." 
ACE is preparing to enter the financing market for Embraers and 777s in the coming weeks. Watch this space.

Highlight: The construction of a second terminal at Dublin airport could cost an additional E100m.
Body
The construction of a second terminal at Dublin airport could cost an additional E100m after the Dublin Airport 
Authority (DAA) was told that the building would have to be extended by at least 50pc to accommodate growth 
plans for major airlines.
It is believed that a 50pc cost increase would add a further E100m on to the E200m figure given initially.
According to a report in the Irish Times the DAA was told in recent weeks that its original plan for a 50,000sq. m 
terminal was unlikely to be beg enough.
 Airlines have told the authority that a facility of 75,000 or 80,000sq. m will be required. The authority has since 
been warned that an increase in size will lead to a significant increase in cost. Airport charges may also have to be 
increased to pay for an expanded option, while the construction of a runway might also need to be brought forward. 
The situation is made more difficult by the imminent flotation of Aer Lingus on the Stock Exchange as the state-
owned airline is currently planning a major expansion of its short and long haul routes. The airline is eager to know 
what kind of capacity will be available at the airport in the years to come. The authority announced plans to build a 
50,000sq. m passenger terminal last summer and had hoped to have the development completed by 2009. At the 
time it said that the new terminal would cost in the region of E170m and E200m. However, the need for a much 
larger facility is likely to add considerable extra cost, and possibly delay, to the project. The DAA said last night that 
it was in talks with airlines on the size of the terminal as the plans of the airports two main airlines, Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus, are now notably different than originally thought last summer. "The current business plans of Aer Lingus 
and Ryanair involve significantly more aggressive passenger growth at Dublin airport than was envisaged in the 
summer of 2005," the DAA said in a statement. The authority will now consider whether it will concede to the 
demands of the two airlines.

Iberia said yesterday its low-cost offshoot - yet to be named - would be based in Barcelona, the destination of 40 
per cent of low-cost flights to Spain. Iberia will contribute Euros 24m (Dollars 30m) to the new airline's Euros 50m in 
start-up capital.
Four domestic partners, including ACS, Spain's largest builder, and Quercus, a private equity fund, will provide the 
remaining capital.
A survey published this week by the Institute of Tourism Studies in Spain showed that low-cost airlines brought 
1.2m passengers to Spain in the first quarter of 2006 - 31 per cent of the total - and a 6 per cent increase over 
2005.
Traditional airlines, by contrast, have lost market share.
"We cannot leave this important market to our low-cost rivals," Iberia said.
Iberia said the new airline might seek a public listing in three to four years, depending on its financial performance. 
It will initially have five aircraft, building up to 30 by 2008.
The new company is seeking slots in Europe, particularly in Germany and the UK, and will be attending a global 
auction of landing slots to be held in Vancouver in June.
Iberia said the new low-cost carrier would be a stand-alone company with independent management, "so as not to 
contaminate the new airline with Iberia's higher cost structure".
Iberia launch takes on low-cost rivals TRANSPORT
Nevertheless, the launch of a Barcelona-based low-cost carrier is expected to allow Iberia to concentrate on its 
Madrid hub and its most profitable routes, especially long-haul flights to the US and Latin America.
Iberia said it would keep flying to European destinations, as they were important feeder routes that brought 
passengers for its long-haul flights.
One quarter of Iberia's long-haul passengers come from outside Spain. But the company said it would gradually 
eliminate its non-profitable domestic routes to cut costs.

Ryanair has introduced its online check-in facility on the Dublin to Cork route after SIPTU agreed to stop blocking 
passengers from using the service. 
The "Check'N'Go facility" allows passengers with an EU passport and travelling only with hand luggage to check in 
through the airline's website btween 72 and four hours before departure. 
The budget airline has already introduced the service on some European routes, and plans to implement it on all 
Irish routes. 
 "We have written to the Department of Transport and are now awaiting the go-ahead to introduce web check-in on 
all Irish routes," said Peter Sherrard. " Web check-in has reduced queues for passengers all over Europe since we 
introduced the service over most of Europe last March, and we anticipate that the Government will soon allow all 
Irish passengers to avail of this time-saving, queue-cutting service."

Irish regional airline Aer Arann has announced that it will begin operating a double daily service from Dublin to 
Cardiff on 1 May.
The announcement comes after Ryanair announced it is to cease its service from Dublin to Cardiff due to the Welsh 
airport increasing passenger charges by over 350pc. These services will now be switched to Bristol International 
Airport as of 1 May.
The new Aer Arann schedule, which will be designed to suit both business and leisure passengers is currently 
being finalised and will be available for sale later today.
 This is Aer Arann's fifth new UK route for summer 2006, having previously announced services from Cork to Cardiff 
and Newquay, Galway to Liverpool and Dublin to Inverness. Ryanair's five year agreement with Cardiff Airport was 
due for renewal on 5 May but the airline has balked at the increased airport charges. Ryanair's Deputy Chief 
Executive, Michael Cawley, said: "Cardiff Airport is pricing itself out of the low fares market. Cost increases of the 
order of 350pc belong to an era when the lowest air fare from Ireland to the UK was E250." Ryanair is offering 
refunds to any passengers who have already booked on these Cardiff flights and who don't wish to travel to Bristol.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair is still finalising arrangements for its proposed maintenance base in central Europe and 
has revealed that it is in discussions with three airports to house the facility.
Speaking to at the Central European Aviation Forum 2006 in Warsaw, Poland last week, Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O’Leary said the airline was in talks with an airport in Poland as well as two others, in two other European 
countries.
He said the $50 million project would employ 1,500 staff, but adds: “We don’t expect to finalise the negotiations for 
another couple of months.”
Rzeszow in south-east Poland is the most likely Polish location, and the Polish airports authority confirms that the 
airport is looking at a maintenance facility for the carrier. The Latvian capital, Riga, has also been tipped as a 
location.
The airline has not indicated where the third possible site might be. Singapore Technologies Aerospace has been 
linked with the project.
Ryanair intends to expand its operations in Poland from serving eight airports this year to establishing three Polish 
bases, and serving 80 routes from 16 airports by 2011.

Controller arrest sparks protest
SAFETY The arrest of a controller in South Africa for his part in a 19 April 2002 accident has been condemned by 
the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers’ Associations (IFATCA) as unjust, contrary to international 
No Headline In Original
agreements, and as having a counter-productive effect on safety. The accident took place at Wonderboom airfield 
when a Cessna 177 carrying three people took off on the wrong runway, putting it on a potential collision course 
with an aircraft on final approach. The pilot carried out a high-bank left turn at low level and hit a wall, killing all on 
board. The accident report says the probable causes were the pilot’s mistake in going to the wrong runway, the 
controller’s failure to observe that he had, and the pilot’s decision to manoeuvre at low level close to stalling speed.

has ruled that the service does not comply with public service obligation (PSO) rules, while Ryanair’s ban comes 
into force on 1 May. The carrier has filed complaints with an Italian court and the European Commission. EasyJet’s 
commercial general manager for southern Europe, Arnaldo Munoz, says the decision is “unlawful and a clear 
example of blind bureaucracy”.
Legendary test pilot killed
obituary Legendary test pilot Scott “Scottie” Crossfield was killed last week in a general aviation accident. 
Crossfield, 84, had been piloting a Cessna 210A that crashed in northern Georgia. Crossfield, as a test pilot for the 
US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics’ (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station (now the NASA Dryden Flight 
Research Facility) at Edwards AFB, California, became the first man to fly at twice the speed of sound when he 
piloted the Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket to a speed of 1,120kt (2,075km/h), or Mach 2.005 in 1953. He later became 
the first man to exceed M3 and survive. Before joining NACA, Crossfield served with the US Navy as a flight 
instructor and fighter pilot during the Second World War.

Indonesian transport conglomerate Cardig International has bought troubled Indonesian carrier Mandala Airlines in 
a deal worth around 300 billion rupiah ($34 million).
“Today the airline has 14 aircraft, but only five are flying,” says Mandala. Two are Boeing 737-400s and three 737-
200s, while the grounded aircraft are all -200s.
Mandala’s operations director T Basuki says some of the grounded 737-200s are being used for spare parts, but 
others are being returned to service. Two parked -200s are returning to service later this month after undergoing C 
checks and three are returning to service in May, adds Basuki, who says Mandala currently operates to around 17 
destinations in Indonesia.
The airline is also looking to get newer aircraft and is considering Airbus A320s and 737-800s, and “this year 
Mandala wants at least two to four”, says Basuki.
Cardig International bought Mandala from Indonesian military-linked Yasasan Dharma Putra Kostrad, which 
reportedly owned 90% of the airline, and the remaining 10% from other organisations.
Cardig International has meanwhile been in talks to sell a stake in Mandala to US investment firm Indigo Partners, 
but it remains unclear if the two have reached an agreement.
A senior official at Cardig International in Jakarta says that Indigo is “one of the potential partners” Cardig 
International has been talking to.
Indigo Partners is a US investment firm that former America West Airlines chief Bill Franke and aviation 
entrepreneur David Bonderman founded in 2002. Bonderman is chairman of European low-cost carrier Ryanair.
Cardig International owns a small cargo airline in Indonesia, Cardig Air, which flies two 737-200Fs. It also has 
aviation-related businesses in ground handling (Jasa Angkasa Semesta Airport Services), catering (JAS Catering),

Southwest Airlines yesterday gave its clearest indication to date that the world's largest low-cost carrier would 
launch international flights for the first time.
The airline said it had advanced preparations to launch cross-border flights with partner ATA Airlines, though chief 
executive Gary Kelly said the domestic market would remain its primary focus over the next two years.
Southwest has provided the business model for the global expansion of low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and 
AirAsia, and is widely regarded as the most efficient airline in the US.
However, it has resisted the temptation to export its strategy for fear that the added cost and complexity of 
international operations would damage its 33-year record of unbroken profitability.
"I'm assuming some day we will," said Mr Kelly when asked on an analysts' call whether international flights were 
on the horizon.
He said the deal with ATA, which flies to Hawaii and Mexico, had helped prepare its reservations system for 
international flights.
"We've got a lot to do, but we're on track," he added, pointing to the need for technical and regulatory work.
Southwest said it would exercise options for 79 Boeing aircraft from 2007-2012, taking its order book to 140 aircraft 
and 116 options, as well as purchase rights for another 54 by the end of 2014.

Fierce competition between spectacles retailers threatens to spill into the courts because of a row over amarketing 
campaign depicting customers of Specsavers as mindless sheep.
Specsavers yesterday threatened legal action against Jamie Murray Wells, the 22-year-old founder of Glasses 
Direct, which sells spectacles and contact lenses over the internet at a fraction of high street prices. The high street 
opticians' solicitors have sent a letter, seen by the Financial Times, to representatives of the online newcomer 
complaining about a promotional campaign featuring people dressed as sheep warning consumers not to get 
"fleeced" by Specsavers.
Mr Murray Wells accused Specsavers of becoming "arrogant" because of its size.
"They are picking on Glasses Direct because we undercut their prices . . . we won't be intimidated by this kind of 
bullying," said the entrepreneur, who used his student loan to start the business.
Mr Murray has challenged the dominant retailers in the Pounds 4bn spectacles market with a low-price internet 
model backed up by a guerrilla marketing campaign featuring online advertising and street-level tactics.
His solicitors likened the dispute to the "unsuccessful history of large companies attempting to use the law to 
prevent such competition", pointing to the precedent set when BA lost its case against rival airline Ryanair over 
aggressive advertising.
In a letter sent to privately owned Specsavers, the minnow defended its campaign.
It said: "Specsavers has decided to use heavy-handed legal tactics to try to stifle competition from Glasses Direct, 
which has successfully challenged the pricing policies of high street opticians."
The letter from Glasses Direct's solicitors concluded: "Our client has no intention of giving in to Specsavers' bullying 
tactics."
Glasses Direct said the purpose of the sheep was to highlight, in a humourous way, its low online prices.
 Specsavers shepherded towards litigation threat
But a letter from Specsavers' solicitors hit back at Mr Murray Wells' campaign.
In it, solicitors for the retail chain wrote it was not "prepared to tolerate the misleading and inaccurate campaign 
which you have embarked upon, nor your disreputable tactics".

If you cannot beat the forces of the internet, you had better hurry up and join them. British Airways' belated 
recognition that people buying their tickets online want a bit of flexibility in return takes it a long way there. Most 
attention focused yesterday on its dramatic price cuts. Flights to Bordeaux for Pounds 29 certainly looks pretty 
sexy. Nothing has brought Europe closer than the budget air revolution. BA's more civilised approach to things like 
allocated seats should complete the process.
But although prices are often far lower here, there is a long way to go before we catch up with the sheer 
convenience of air travel in the US - where the frequency and flexibility of flights between large cities like New York 
and Washington encourages travellers to treat some services like hopping on a bus.
In the longer run, BA's grudging acceptance that economy customers might want to change their flights at the last 
minute or buy cheap one-way tickets could prove the more revolutionary aspect of yesterday's razzmatazz.
The US has also led the way in blurring the boundaries between budget and traditional airlines. Last year, Delta 
presaged BA's move by scrapping irritating requirements for overnight stays on Saturdays and also cut prices by up 
to 50 per cent.
The difference is the older US airlines are more unpleasant to travel on than the shiny new ones. If BA really wants 
to put the wind up EasyJet and Ryanair, it needs to continue outclassing them on customer service too.

British Airways PLC issued a direct challenge to European low-cost carriers Thursday, slashing several short-haul 
fares by as much as 50 percent as it tries to win back passengers.
BA, which has struggled to maintain its market share against price undercutting by budget airlines such as Ryanair 
Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, said it would offer greatly reduced one-way tickets to 65 destinations.
The airline said the price cuts were part of an overhaul of the airline's fare structure, rather than a one-off 
promotion.
"This is not a short-term gimmick, but a long-term commitment to our millions of customers to offer low fares every 
day of the year," commercial director Martin George said.
The ticket sale came just days after BA announced a further increase in the fuel surcharge on its long-haul flights 
because of soaring crude oil prices.
Shares in BA dipped 0.07 percent to 340.25 pence (US$6.06; €5.05) on the London Stock Exchange.
BA said it would continue to provide full service to customers booking inexpensive tickets.
Unlike the low-cost airlines, BA will not charge extra for food and drink onboard or for checked-in luggage. Ryanair 
introduced charges last month for passengers wanting to check in bags.
The new BA fares include all taxes and fuel surcharges, but there is a charge for passengers who do not book 
online.
Airfares across Europe have been driven down in recent years following the birth of the "no frills" airlines.
Lufthansa AG, Germany's biggest airline, announced new low fares on 181 international routes and on 51 German 
domestic flights last month.
British Airways takes on low-cost operators by slashing European fares by up to 50 percent
BA's best price on a one-way flight from London to Naples, Italy, is now 39 pounds (US$70; €58) a big drop from 
the 286 pounds the airline charged in 1996. Similarly, a flight from London to Bordeaux, France, has fallen to 29 
pounds (US$52; €43) from 206 pounds.
BA said there would be no job cuts as a result of the lower ticket prices launched Thursday.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh has outlined plans to cut costs at the airline by 450 million pounds (US$800 million; 
€670 million), including the loss of 600 management jobs and a further round of cuts in call centers and travel 
shops.
The airline has twice raised its fuel surcharge on long-haul flights since September by a total of 10 pounds (US$18; 
€15) as oil prices surge. Oil futures in New York hit a record high of US$72.49 Thursday.

Body
British Airways is set to throw down the gauntlet to budget airlines easyJet and Ryanair by slashing prices from 
Heathrow and Gatwick to almost all its European short haul destinations, according to reports.
BA will cut fares to places such as Berlin, Paris and Barcelona by up to 50pc, according to a report in the Guardian 
newspaper today, citing airline insiders.
The price cuts are part of an overhaul of the airline's fare structure, rather than a one-off promotion, according to 
the article.
 Unlike the low-cost carriers, BA will carry on offering its traditional extras, including free food and drink on all flights. 
There will also be no extra charges for hold baggage. Last month, Ryanair imposed a £5.00 per bag fee on all 
passengers wanting to check in luggage, following Exeter-based Flybe, which started charging £4.50 per bag in 
February. BA believes the combination of much lower fares with the convenience and flight transfers offered by 
Heathrow and Gatwick, and prime destination airports will win large numbers of passengers from the no-frills 
carriers. Airline insiders said yesterday that BA had been experimenting with the new lower fares on a handful of its 
short haul routes in recent months. They have prompted a significant pick-up in the number of passengers carried. 
On some routes the load factor has improved by up to nine percentage points, though BA's target for the new 
strategy is understood to be substantially lower than that, according to the article.

Today Ryanair celebrated its 140 millionth passenger with, entirely free of charge, a toilet bag. 
The no-frills airline, together with Southwest and Easyjet, has been voted one of the world's worst airlines for in-
flight amenities.
However, Ryanair said that it is proud that it doesn't waste money on freebies they believe such as ill-fittting socks, 
fold- up toothbrushes and undrinkable plonk. They believe that they give passengers amenities they really want 
which are low fares, fewest lost bags, no cancelled flights and, of course, toilet bags.
 Ryanair Spokesperson, Lorna Farren, said: "It's interesting to note that in the same poll, BA was ranked number 
one for in-flight amenities. This is because BA are busy giving out useless freebies whilst at the same time hitting 
passengers for a £35 fuel surcharge on top of high fares, frequent delays and cancellations." This comes after 
British Airways plan to cut fares to places such as Berlin, Paris and Barcelona by up to 50pc according to reports.

No-frills airline Ryanair has slammed Italian aviation agency ENAC of anti-competitive favouritism towards its 
country's national carriers. 
This comes after the organisation banned Ryanair from operating flights on its Rome- Alghero route after May 1.
The airline believes that the routes are being granted exclusively to selected Italian carriers in order to funnel more 
state aid to Italian airlines.
 Ryanair has complained to the European Commission and has applied to the administrative court in Rome to 
ensure their 10,000 Italian customers are not denied travel after May 1.

Body
Aer Lingus said it will continue to monitor developments in relation to the high price of international oil after KLM 
and British Airways both announced a fuel-surcharge on long-haul flights yesterday.
The state-airline said that the high price of oil is becoming an area of major concern.
BA said on Tuesday that it was raising its fuel surcharge on long-haul tickets sold in the UK to £35 per flight - up 
from a previous £30. This is the first time the airline has increased the levy since September 2005.
 No-frills airline Ryanair slammed the decision by BA to increase fuel surcharges and said that it would not apply 
fuel charges "not today, tomorrow or ever". The airline, which is now unhedged on its fuel costs said "oil prices can 
double again to USD150 per barrel and Ryanair still won't apply fuel surcharges". The criticism came after BA 
announced it was raising its fuel surcharge on long-haul tickets sold in the UK to £35 per flight - up from a previous 
£30.This is the first time the airline has increased the levy since September 2005. BA added that it now expected 
this year's fuel bill to be £600m higher than last year at £2.2 bn, as a result of soaring oil, up from previous 
forecasts for a £400m increase. "Our fuel costs remain a real burden. The price of oil has risen above dollar 70 a 
barrel and experts anticipate it staying at these levels for some time," BA commercial director Martin George said in 
a statement. BA will not increase surcharges on short-haul flights where it faces stiff competition from low-cost 
airlines such as Ryanair which do not have fuel surcharges.

Sky-high oil prices kept a lid on European stock markets yesterday, although the main indices were helped off the 
worst levels of the day by a strong early rally on Wall Street.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended at 1,368.17, down 1.24 points or 0.1 per cent.
Philips Electronics fell back in spite of unveiling a fairly reassuring set of first-quarter results.
The company said improved performances by its semiconductor and lighting divisions were behind a 37 per cent 
rise in net profits to Euros 160m.
Philips said it remained on course to achieve its targets for medium-term sales growth and earnings and would 
continue to explore opportunities for targeted acquisitions.
Nomura International, which has a "buy" rating on the stock, said the figures showed solid sales but unspectacular 
profitability.
"Even though the sales growth is very impressive, there are enough niggles with higher pension provisions and 
lower profitability from unconsolidated companies to take the shine off a sales-driven performance," said Nomura 
analyst Sean Murphy.
There was also some disappointment among investors that the company had not extended a share buyback. The 
company completed a Euros 1.5bn buyback operation in the first quarter
Philips' shares fell 2.1 per cent to Euros 26.28.
A number of other big-name tech companies are due to unveil their quarterly figures this week, including Nokia, 
down 0.3 per cent at Euros 17.36, Ericsson, 0.7 per cent lower at SKr29.30, and SAP, off 1.5 per cent at Euros 
180.07.
Philips dips despite results cheer EUROPE
According to Thomson Financial, earnings growth for companies in the DJ Stoxx 600 European share index is set 
to average8.8 per cent this year, well down on the 16.6 per cent growth seen in 2005. Lehman Brothers, 
meanwhile, highlighted the importance of dividend growth in Europe at the moment.
"We forecast that European companies will increase their dividends by 14 per cent over the course of 2006," said 
analyst Inigo Fraser-Jenkins.
"This is above the current bottom-up consensus of10 per cent. We think that dividend growth can provide a support 
for the market in a period of decelerating earnings."
Hefty gains for oil stocks limited the overall market's decline as crude prices hit all-time highs. Statoil leapt 4.1 per 
cent to NKr202.50 after Merrill Lynch raised its price target for the stock from NKr190 to NKr220.
Local rival Norsk Hydro rose 3 per cent to NKr958.50.
But there were losses for airlines as crude prices strengthened. Air France-KLM fell 1.9 per cent to Euros 18.42, 
Ryanair shed 1.4 per cent to Euros 7.17 and SAS, the Scandinavian airline, slipped 3.8 per cent to SKr101.50.

British Airways to increase passenger fuel surcharge on long haul flights

Body
British Airways PLC, which is facing tough competition from budget airlines and struggling to cope with surging oil 
prices, announced a further increase in the fuel surcharge on its longhaul flights Tuesday.
BA said soaring crude oil prices had forced it to raise its forecast for its 2005/2006 fuel bill and it was "regrettably" 
passing some of that cost on to passengers.
"Our fuel costs remain a real burden," said Martin George, BA's commercial director. "The price of oil has risen 
above US$70 a barrel and experts anticipate it staying at these levels for some time."
The longhaul fuel surcharge on tickets sold and issued in Britain will increase to 35 pounds (US$62; €52) per one-
way flight, from 30 pounds (US$53; €44) currently. The new charge will apply on all tickets issued from April 21.
The airline added that it "will look to increase its fuel surcharges to similar levels on longhaul flights sold in overseas 
markets."
BA last raised its fuel surcharge for long-haul flights for a one-way trip in September last year.
George said the company now expects its fuel bill to increase by 600 million pounds (US$1.1 billion; €920 million) to 
2.2 billion pounds (US$3.9 billion; €3.3 billion) this financial year. It had previously forecast a smaller increase of 
400 million pounds (US$710 million; €590 million).
The airline announced the new surcharge as oil prices hit a new intraday high of US$70.88 a barrel Tuesday amid 
international tension over Iran's nuclear program and worries about supply disruptions in Nigeria. In London, Brent 
crude for June delivery at the ICE Futures exchange also hit an all-time high of US$72.20 a barrel.
The unrelenting climb of oil prices has badly hurt the bottom lines of airlines worldwide, forcing many, including 
Lufthansa, China Southern and others, to raise ticket prices through higher fuel surcharges.
BA competitor Virgin Atlantic last month also raised its surcharge on one-way tickets to 35 pounds (US$62; €52) 
per one-way flight from 30 pounds (US$53; €44).
British Airways to increase passenger fuel surcharge on long haul flights
In contrast, budget airlines such as Ryanair Holdings PLC have imposed no extra fuel charges on passengers, a 
decision they claim has helped keep prices low and win customers from the full-service airlines.
British Airways shares closed 1.3 percent higher at 341.25 pence (US$6.07; €5.06) on the London Stock Exchange.

British Airways PLC on Tuesday raised its trans-Atlantic fuel surcharge for tickets sold in the U.S. by $10 each way 
to $65 as it struggles with higher jet-fuel prices and competition from lower cost carriers.
The longhaul fuel surcharge on tickets sold in Britain will increase to 35 pounds ($62) per one-way flight, up from 30 
pounds ($53). The new charge will apply on all tickets issued from April 21.

for May delivery settled in New York on Monday at a record $70.40 a barrel.

Captain’s authority denied in bomb threat
security A Ryanair Boeing 737-800 with 167 passengers and six crew on board suffered a bomb threat during a 12 
April Beauvais-Dublin flight. A piece of paper with the threat was handed to the cabin crew. On declaring an 
emergency, the crew was asked to fly the aircraft to Glasgow Prestwick, and en route the aircraft was escorted by 
three Royal Air Force Panavia Tornado F3s. At Prestwick the aircraft was isolated and, according to passengers, 
even the emergency services stayed clear. The pilot told them several times he had asked the authorities for 
permission to disembark them, but for more than 2h he was told not to. The International Federation of Airline Pilots 
Associations says the International Civil Aviation Organisation security advice is that “the paramount objective is the 
safe release of the passengers and crew”, which, ICAO says, should override any consideration relating to 
capturing those responsible for illegal action or threats. A thorough search of the aircraft later found no explosive.
Human error blamed for Falcon 1 failure
Launch Space Exploration Technologies says the failure of the maiden launch of its Falcon 1 booster was due to 
human error by a pad technician who failed to tighten a fuel pipe fitting, causing a propellant leak in flight. The leak 
occurred around the top of the main engine “and fire cut into the first stage helium pneumatic system”, shutting 
down the engine.
Diamond postpones China opening
Delay Diamond Aircraft has delayed the opening of its factory in Binzhou, China until at least the end of the year. 
The Austrian manufacturer unveiled plans last April to open in August 2005 a Chinese factory with an undisclosed

start in late 2006.

The aircraft was forced to make the diversion after a note was passed to the cabin crew claiming that there was a

The warning was reported to air traffic controllers by the aircraft captain who ordered him to divert to Prestwick in 
the West of Scotland.
 The plane was then escorted into Prestwick by Royal Air Force fighters. The 167 passengers on board were taken 
off the aircraft and questioned by police while the aircraft was searched. Several incoming flights were diverted to 
other airports during the incident but the terminal stayed open and other passengers checked in as normal. After a

Body
Air Berlin, Europe's third- largest low-cost airline, is preparing a listing to take on rivals Ryanair and EasyJet even 
though high fuel costs and changes to accounting rules have dragged it into the red for the past two years.
Joachim Hunold, chief executive, said he was forging ahead with plans for an initial public offering before early 
June, confident the carrier's bottom line would "reap the rewards" of recent restructuring before the end of the year.
"We've worked our way to the number three spot" in Europe's low-cost market, Mr Hunold said at a press briefing in 
Frankfurt. The carrier's "minimum goal" over the next two to three years was to "maintain that position".
Air Berlin flies to 73 airports across Europe, running point-to-point services from some big airports such as Frankfurt 
and hub-services from bases at Nuremberg, Palma and London Stansted airports.
The company plans to raise between Euros 600m and Euros 900m (Dollars 728m-Dollars 1.1bn) from the float of a 
50 per cent stake. It plans to use half of the cash to expand its network into Scandinavia and eastern Europe. Mr 
Hunold and the six other shareholders in the company will get the rest. Keen to reduce its reliance on its traditional 
charter business by expanding into scheduled flights, in late 2004, the Berlin carrier and its Austrian partner Niki 
committed more than Euros 5bn in ordering 70 Airbus 320s with an option for afurther 40.
Since Air Berlin announced its "city shuttle" seat-only services in 2002, the number of people flying in its 53 jets 
doubled to 13.5m last year.
But the carrier still trails Ryanair and EasyJet, which each carry about 30m people per year.
Given that a good part of Air Berlin's business is still in charter flights, Mercer Management Consultants estimates it 
controls only 7.9 per cent of the low-cost market, while Ryanair boasts 26.9 per cent and EasyJet 26 per cent.
Mr Hunold stressed that Air Berlin had never intended to copy its larger rivals.
Air Berlin prepares for listing AIRLINES
He called the company he built up "a low-cost carrier with frills" that offered an air-miles programme and routes to 
big airports his rivals currently did not.
He said Euros 1.2bn in sales last year rendered a profit before interest, taxes and leases of Euros 153m.
But a tax charge due to accounting changes, a surging dollar and fuel costs led to a net loss of Euros 116m after a 
loss of Euros 3m in 2004.

proved to be his media empire's victory.
Although the benchmark MIB30 index in Milan fell 2 per cent, Mediaset, the broadcaster owned by Mr Berlusconi, 
bucked the Italian market's trend.
Yesterday the shares gained 1.1 per cent to Euros 10.17 as it appeared that Romano Prodi's narrow election win 
would leave the ruling coalition without the parliamentary strength to put promised reforms into effect.
It was a tough session in the wider market as soaring commodity prices inflamed concerns over inflation. Although 
an afternoon rally by Nokia briefly helped the main indices off their worst levels, falls on US indices drove the FTSE 
Eurofirst 300 to a close of 1,367.27, down 1.2 per cent.
Nokia, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, gained 3.7 per cent to Euros 17.60 after it dispelled market 
fears that it was heading for a pricing squeeze. The company said that handset prices in the first quarter rose to 
Euros 103, beating its own forecast of Euros 99 or less, as it sold more advanced models.
The biggest negative influence on the market yesterday was the financial sector and other stocks heavily exposed 
to falling equity prices.
UBS, the Swiss bank, announced plans for the acquisition of Piper Jaffray's private client branchnetwork for Dollars 
500m incash. Traders said the deal was a good strategic fit and UBS should be able tolift the profitability of the new 
business, which has Dollars 52bn in client assets.UBS shares, however, fell1.7 per cent to SFr144.10.
Milan-listed banks were among the biggest fallers after the uncertainty caused by the election. Unicredito fell 3.8 
per cent to Euros 5.83, Mediobanca shed 3.4 per cent to Euros 17.23 and Banche Popolari Unite fell 3.5 per cent to 
Euros 19.48.
Beaten Berlusconi's silver lining EUROPE
Investors took profits in Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling after Goldman Sachs said that although it remained confident 
of the company delivering on earnings targets, the valuation looked stretched after a good run. The shares fell 4.9 
per cent to Euros 26.20.
Alstom, the French engineer, fell 6.3 per cent to Euros 65.25 after Patrick Kron, chief executive, said he expected 
the company to report sales in China of Euros 1bn, down from the Euros 1.6bn reported a year earlier.
Adidas Salomon, the German sportswear maker, gained 1.8 per cent to Euros 170.49 after it raised its targets for 
cost synergies from its takeover of Reebok of the US.
Brent crude hit a record high during the session, causing those stocks most exposed to high fuel prices to fall. 
Lufthansa, which reported a 0.4 per cent rise in traffic, shed 3.2 per cent to Euros 14.33, while Ryanair dropped 2 
per cent to Euros 7.38.

Ryanair is calling for reform of Polish airports, urging the Polish Government to abolish rigid centralised tariffs that 
are imposed on them. 
The airline is also seeking a secondary airport for Warsaw in Modlin, claiming that it would significantly increase 
competition and lead to lower airfares for passengers. 
In a bid to entice air travellers to back Ryanair the company is offering free flights to the first 100 people to send an 
e-mail message support the firm's call for reform in Polish airports. 
 "Regional airports in Poland must be allowed to fulfil their potential as wealth and job creators in their regions but 
they cannot do this when their costs are controlled centrally in Warsaw, restricting their capacity to compete for new 
business," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO. "We are also calling on the Polish Government to open a 
secondary airport for Warsaw at the ex military base in Modlin. All over Europe secondary competing airports 
around major cities have been hugely beneficial in driving down airfares and increasing visitor numbers to capital 
cities."

Air Berlin, the German airline, has accelerated its plans to go public, FT Deutschland, the FT's sister paper has 
learnt.
Germany's second-largest air carrier now plans to list in Frankfurt in May.
The group wants to place 50 per cent of its capital on the market and raise Euros 600m-Euros 900m (Dollars 726m-
Dollars 1bn)). More than half of the revenue should be reinvested in the group; the rest will be given to 
shareholders.
Analysts will begin to sound out selected investors this week and the roadshow could begin as early as two weeks 
from now.
Air Berlin yesterday refused to comment. The group has decided to list earlier on the market than originally planned 
due to high demand for share offerings.
Joachim Hunold, chief executive, said at the beginning of March that the IPO would take place before the end of the 
year - with the exact date dependant on developments in the market.
Since then the Dax has reached record highs. There has also been a flurry of recent IPOs.
Morgan Stanley and Commerzbank are managing the listing and using Ryanair and easyJet as a benchmark to 
work out the price of Air Berlin shares.

Sweden's prime minister and a former foreign minister are suing Ryanair over an advertising campaign that used 
their pictures alongside the tagline "Time to leave the country?"
Goran Persson, a Social Democrat who has ruled the Nordic country for 10 years, and Laila Freivalds, his former 
foreign minister, are suing the discount airline for SKr75,000 (Pounds 5,614) each in a Stockholm court for 
unauthorised use of their pictures.
Mrs Freivalds, one of Sweden's least popular politicians after her handlingof the tsunami crisis,was forced to resign 
last month.
The publication of the advertisements for no-frills flights to such destinations as Frankfurt, Gdansk and Riga 
coincided with a build-up to parliamentary hearings on the government's slow measures to help Swedes who were 
caught up in the tsunami crisis. About 550 Swedes were killed in the disaster - the country's biggest crisis death toll 
since the sinking of the Estonia ferry more than 10 years ago.
Lennart Kanter, Mr Persson's solicitor, said the timing of the adverts was offensive.
"The use (of the pictures) has caused suffering and is apparently hurtful," Mr Kanter was quoted as saying in the 
Swedish press.
Mr Kanter said the case was a clear breach of the Swedish law on pictures and advertising.
"It (the law) is unusually clear and says that one is not allowed to use (the picture of) a living person in an 
advertisement withoutpermission," Mr Kantersaid.
Mr Persson and Mrs Freivalds took legal action against Ryanair after the company failed to pay a bill they sent it for 
the use of the pictures.
Swedish premier and ex-minister sue Ryanair over adverts with  their pictures 'NO PERMISSION'
Lotta Lindquist, Ryanair's Scandinavian sales manager, said: "This must be the first time that a Swedish politician 
has objected to his image being published in a newspaper.
"This court case is a complete waste of Swedish tax payers' money and is another example of this government 
attempting to stifle competition in the airline market."
Ms Lindquist said Ryanair opposed the Swedish government's plan to introduce a SKr94 environmental tax on air 
travel.
Mr Persson, who prides himself on the Social Democratic party's achievements in creating an egalitarian society, 
faces a tough challenge from the centre-right opposition alliance inSeptember's general elections.
His opponents say Sweden's social system - based on the world's highest taxes - has spawned large-scale flight of 
both Swedes and Swedish capital abroad.
The Social Democrats have ruled the country for all but nine of the past 74 years.

Budget airline easyJet said today that it carried 7% more passengers in March than it did in the same month last 
year.
The company saw 2.75 million passengers use its services last month, 180,000 more than in March 2005.
Although the load factor, which shows the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available, 
fell from 91.1% in March 2005 to 86.3%, last months figure was slightly ahead of expectations as the numbers for 
2005 were exceptionally high because Easter fell in March, the airline said.
Two days ago, easyJets larger rival Ryanair said it carried three million passengers in March, 17% more than a 
year ago. Its load factor was 79% against 80% for March 2005.
British Airways, which is now Europes third-largest airline, said on Wednesday that although passenger traffic had 
risen 1.8% year-on-year, its March load factor was down 0.5 points to 75.2% percent.
But easyJets (EZJ) 7.1% increase in the number of passengers did not match the 13% addition to capacity coming 
from additional flights and new routes.
Total revenue for the 12 months to the end of March was £1.4 billion, 17.7% up on the £1.2 billion recorded in the 
previous year. The first half results will be revealed on 3 May.
easyJet was thought to be a bid target for the Icelandic investment group FL, but speculation came to an end on 
Wednesday when it said it had unloaded its 16.9% stake making a profit of 140 million.
In the first 30 minutes trading today easyJet shares added 3.5p to 335.5p with almost a million going through the 
market in 96 deals.
The low for the shares was 210.5p on 29 April 2005, constant bid rumours pushing them to a high of 411p on 10 
January.
Earlier this week easyJet lodged a legal appeal in Rome against both the Italian Transport Ministry and the Italian 
Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC) over their alleged anti-competitive behaviour regarding a route between Milan and 
Olbia.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and former Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds have sued Irish-based low-cost 
airline Ryanair for using their faces in a newspaper advertisement without permission, a government spokeswoman 
said Thursday.
Persson and Freivalds are demanding 75,000 kronor (about €8,000; US$10,000) each in damages for an ad 
showing their pictures above the text, "Time to flee the country?" government spokeswoman Camila Buzaglo said.
The ad, which touted low fares on international flights, was published in Sweden's major newspaper on Feb. 27 at a 
time when the Social Democratic government was under heavy media pressure to explain perceived shortcomings 
in its handling of international crises like the 2004 tsunami disaster and the prophet cartoon uproar this year.
Freivalds resigned March 21 after she was accused of lying about her role in the closing of a right-wing Web site 
that solicited cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
The lawsuit filed in the Stockholm District Court claims the ad was insulting and offensive to Persson and Freivalds.
Ryanair's Swedish spokeswoman Lotta Lindquist-Brosjo said the lawsuit was unfounded.
"Our marketing often alludes to current events, and these are very public figures," she said. "This is a government 
that plans to introduce more taxes to prevent competition (in the airline industry). This (lawsuit) is just one more way

No-frills airline Ryanair has offered dissatisfied Aer Lingus passengers free flights, as part of its latest marketing 
drive.
Ryanair has urged any passengers who have failed to received a reply to letters of complaint from the state owned 
airline to get in touch with them.
Ryanair communications executive Lorna Farren said: "Even complaints from the director of consumer affairs are 
routinely ignored by Aer Lingus, so Ryanair is offering the thousands of long-suffering passengers that Aer Lingus 
has let down free flights and real customer service delivery with Ryanair."
 The timing of Ryanair's campaign may have much to do with what is happening at Aer Lingus, which is Ryanair's 
main competitor in Ireland. The Government confirmed on Tuesday that it backed plans for a partial privatisation of 
Aer Lingus and confirmed that it will sell a majority stake in airline. During recent years, Aer Lingus has built its 
European short haul-business on flying to destinations that Ryanair did not serve from Dublin. However, since the 
turn of the year Ryanair has announced a spate of new routes as it attempts to increase its dominant position over 
Aer Lingus in the low-cost market. In a statement Ryanair said: "If Aer Lingus has not replied to your letter of 
complaint within six weeks or lost your luggage within the last year, send your complaints to

When the market is awash with bid speculation, it can be hard to strip out the artificial inflation and work out a 
stock's real value. EasyJet's investors must be wishing they had remained in blissful ignorance.
EasyJet shares fell more than8 per cent to Pounds 3.27 yesterday, afterFL Group, an Icelandic investor, sold its 
16.7 per cent stake in the low-cost airline, realising a handsome profit.
The problem seems to be that investors have just lost the strongest reason to buy the stock. EasyJet already faces 
the task of doubling its earnings to hit analysts' targets for the year ending September 2008.
This may be achievable. Margins are substantially below those of rival Ryanair, and there is therefore scope for 
improvement, both through cost cuts and slower capacity growth.But it is certainly not a given. The short-haul 
European airline market remains very competitive. With seat growth substantially outstripping economic growth in 
the region, price pressure is unlikely to abate.
JPMorgan, charged with sellingFL Group's stake in the market yesterday, was clearly bullish on the stock. The bank 
is one of only three out of the 18 that cover the stock with a current "buy" recommendation, according to 
Bloomberg.
Last week, JPMorgan research pronounced it was "a good opportunity to buy", predicated on the previous day's 
share price of Pounds 3.54. The bank clearly took its own advice, but its experience in the market yesterday 
showed that investors disagree.
EasyJet's founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, and his family still own a 41 per cent stake, so fresh bid speculation to 
buoy the price seems unlikely. No doubt the stock will quickly settle into a new trading range, but at around 20 times 
this year's earnings, it still does not look particularly cheap.

FL Group's sale of its 16.9 per cent stake in EasyJet ends months of takeover speculation in the stock and forces 
investors' attention back on to the low-costairline's fundamentals.
Iceland's FL Group accumulated its stake gradually since October 2004, becoming the airline's largest shareholder.
Yesterday, it sold the stake for approximately Euros 325m (Pounds 227m) and hasrealised a profit of Euros 140m 
on its investment.
EasyJet shares have risen strongly during the last18 months supported by increasing speculation about a possible 
takeover bid by FL Group.
Its share price closed 31p, or 8.7 per cent, lower yesterday at 327p, cutting itsmarket capitalisation from Pounds 
1.45bn to Pounds 1.3bn.
It reached a three-year peak of 408 1/4p in early January when the airline announced that it had appointed 
Goldman Sachs as financial adviser, a move seen as strengthening its defences against a hostile bid.
Andrew Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, said last month that his immediate focus was on improving the group's 
profitability, where the airline had been lagging behind the competition - most importantly, Ryanair.
EasyJet was making only Pounds 2 profit per passenger compared with Pounds 5 at its Irish rival.
Tomorrow, EasyJet is expected to report very weak traffic data for March, which could add further short-term 
instability to its share price.
The weakness will be partly because of the later timing of Easter this year.
The airline has already warned that it could report next month a doubling of its first half pre-tax losses.

"I do not see any big catalyst until the year end to demonstrate that the business plan is coming together," said 
Penelope Butcher, aviation analyst at Morgan Stanley. "On valuation, it is looking pretty pricey."
FL Group said it had sold its stake "primarily due to other investment opportunities".
Hannes Smarason, FL Group chief executive, said the EasyJet investment had provided the "foundation" on which 
the investment group had been built.
It remained committed to its stakes in Finnair, Sterling, the Danish low-cost carrier, and Icelandair, but already this 
year it had bought stakes in Bang & Olufsen and Royal Unibrew in Denmark, Aktiv Kapital in Norway and Glitnir, the 
Icelandic bank.

Airline boss hopping mad at French OBSERVER

For the boss of a young budget airline there are worse role models than Michael O'Leary. The combative chief 
executive of Ryanair made the Irish low-cost carrier among the most profitable airlines in the world.
But Philip Meeson, the chairman and chief executive and possibly pilot of Jet2.com, clearly believes the secret of 
success is O'Leary's notoriously foul mouth.
Last week the Yorkshire-based company asked striking French air-traffic controllers if their response to the 
government's controversial labour reform might not be a slight over-reaction. Or, as the website put it: "Jet2.com 
condemns French strike action and calls for lazy frogs to get back to work!"
After an angry response from the unions, Jet2.Com yesterday produced an uplifting tale of a calm negotiation with 
students who blocked the runway at Chambery airport. Or: "How the intrepid folk of Yorkshire broke the French 
blockade."
A strangely unnamed, yet presumably representative passenger, said: "Having flown to Budapest, Geneva and 
Prague in the past with Jet2.com and looking forward to their new services to Milan, Nice and Rome this summer, I 
can honestly say this was the most amazing scene I've witnessed in my years of low-cost travel with the north's 
low-cost airline." Meeson still has things to learn: it took five days for the media to notice his tirade.

Travellers could be forced to check in more items of luggage when flying this summer, after a clampdown on 
excess carry-on bags by airport authorities.
BAA, the airports operator, warned yesterday that the days of the large "wheelie bag" cluttering overhead luggage 
bins were numbered. Business-class passengers will also be prevented from carrying on more than two bags, and 
economy-class passengers limited to just one bag.
BAA is concerned that too many passengers are flouting hand luggage restrictions to save time on arrival by 
avoiding the wait for checked bags.
It said travellers were creating long queues at security checks by carrying bags that were too thick and so needed 
to be examined individually, or bringing too many pieces of luggage.
The move could concern some of the no-frills airlines that have recently sought to discourage their customers from 
checking in bags, in a drive to cut handling costs.
The Department for Transport last week sent a reminder to airlines and airports of the restrictions on the size of 
bags carried on to flights.
The air transport industry's guidelines state bags should be no larger than 22in long, 18in wide and 10in deep (or 
roughly 56cm x 46cm x 25cm). BAA said that limit would be enforced from this summer, although the details of how 
it would be policed were not yet clear.
Though there has been an increasing trend among passengers to use bigger wheelie bags, most purpose-designed 
drag-along bags do stay within the limit.
Yesterday BAA met airline representatives on the airline operators' committee to ask them to enforce their own 
rules on the number of bags passengers are allowed to take on board.
Passengers face extra luggage restrictions
Many business travellers frequently carry a drag-along bag plus their briefcase and laptop computer bag. BAA said 
the tight security at airports now meant problems were caused as laptops and larger bags had to be examined 
separately. Heathrow, for example, planned to increase the number of security checking staff.
BAA said: "Passenger trends have changed and the advent of the wheelie bag means that passengers can now 
drag on much more luggage. But the day of the giant wheelie bag coming on to aircraft is over."
The moves could conflict with budget airlines' plans to encourage passengers to restrict themselves to cabin 
baggage. Ryanair and Flybe have introduced charges for checking in bags in an attempt to reduce handling 
operations at airports and potentially cut the number of check-in desks they rent.

After being lower for most the morning, the FTSE 100 index was eventually hauled into positive territory by the 
heavy buying of mining shares and a refining surprise from hurricane hit BP.
Mining shares continued to gain ground with raw material prices generally staying around their recent highs. 
Antofagasta was the biggest FTSE 100 winner with an 82p gain to £22.89, followed by Rio Tinto, up 80p to £31.24, 
and Xstrata, 45p better at £19.85.
BHP Billiton, which says it could double its copper capacity and treble uranium production with a $5 billion 
investment in its Australian Olympic mine, also powered ahead with a 19p rise to £11.41.
Although BP was forced to report a first quarter fall in oil and gas production, refining performed better than 
expected and the shares added 8p to 672.5p with over 46 million shares changing hands making the second most 
active stock of the morning.
Banking shares were weak with bid favourite Alliance & Leicester the biggest loser with a 6.57% fall to £11.66, 
down 82p. Northern Rock fell 36p to £11.30, a 3% drop.
Another debilitating factor was shares going ex-dividend. These included pension specialists Friends Provident, 
down 6.25p to 204.5p, bricky Hanson, down15.5p to 752.5p, retail group Kingfisher, 6.5p down at 233p, and on-line 
poker group PartyGaming, 3p lower at 128.75p.
Sainsburys shares, 4.625p higher at 338.125p, were in demand after reports said it had overtaken Asda to regain 
its place as the number two supermarket group after Tesco, 1.875p better at 327.5p.
Prices were marked sharply higher in the first minutes, but when the buyers didnt appear, they drifted away so that 
at 10.22 the FTSE 100 recorded its low for the day, 5,983.5. By 12.15 pm it had clawed into back into positive 
territory with a 2.6 point gain to 6,007.3.
Gains were made in the other key indices with the FTSE 250 7.4 points higher at 9,899.7, the FTSE 350 up 1.8 
points to 3,120.4 and the FTSE AIM All-Share 4.2 points better to break through 1,200 at 1.201.6. Volume was 
below average with 1.175 billion shares going through the market in 139,670 deals. In the FTSE 250, easyJet was 
feature following news that the Icelandic investment group FL had placed its 16.9% stake of 65 million shares at 
between 340-343p. This brought an end to the bid talk that has buoyed the shares in recent months.

easyJet eased to 326.75p, down 31.25p or 8.73%. Rival Ryanair by contrast added 0.027 to 7.637 after revealing 
that passenger traffic rose 17% in March.
As well as being the biggest FTSE 250 faller, easyJet was an active stock with 18.5 million shares going through 
the ticker, second only to Woolworths with 23.5 million.
After a bright start in Frankfurt, shares lost ground with the DAX 30 4.42 points lower at 6,009.43 by 11.50. 
Lufthansa was a weak spot after the placing of 9.5 million shares, while Linde fell on a broker downgrade.
There is increasing speculation that the slow rise in US interest rates may be at an end, enough for the pound to 
lose ground against the US dollar to 1.7522 against the overnight 1.7552. Sterling at 1.4295 was also weaker 
against the overnight rate Euro rate of 1.4316.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial index is expected slip to an 2.8 fall to around 11,201. Dealer interest will 
be centred on crude oil stocks and non-manufacturing data.

Ryanair has cancelled all its flights to and from France today as mass protests take place across the country over 
the government's new youth labour law.
Aer Lingus says it is hoping to operate all its scheduled flights, but it warns passengers that they may face delays.
Hundreds of thousands of workers and students are expected to support today's strike action and participate in 
marches against the unpopular First Job Contract. 
 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, who has championed the contract saw poll ratings for his handling of the 
economy slide to the lowest level since he took office nearly a year ago, in a survey released on today. Opponents 
of the regulations want at least as many people to take to the streets as a week ago, when between one and three 
million protesters marched through French cities in the biggest demonstration the country has seen for decades. 
President Jacques Chirac later urged a softening of key parts of the legislation and his conservatives yesterday 
hinted at further climb-downs on the measure, intended to make it easier for firms to hire and fire young workers.

Length: 310 words
Highlight: Two hundred delegates converged on New Delhi to attend Airfinance Journal's Conference. Geoff Hearn 
reports on the booming Indian airline sector, which was the focus of a lively debate.
Body
A delegate could be excused for being confused. The model for a successful airline in India is to follow the classic 
no-frills operation typified by Southwest Airlines and Ryanair. Or, India is such a distinctive market that the classic 
model will not work; offering a premium service is the key. 
People who should know - India's crop of talented airline bosses - made powerful cases for both arguments at 
Airfinance Journal's Delhi conference. 
Carl Saldanha, chief financial officer of Jet Airways and Jeh Wadia, managing director of GoAir, put the case for the 
defence of the classic model. Raj Thiagarajan, managing director of Paramount Airways, was the principle advocate 
of the premium service model, with strong support from Kingfisher Airlines, which added that the brand was an 
essential part of the mix. 
The argument goes that India's burgeoning middle class expects the best, and since so many costs in India are 
effectively fixed, it is only marginally more expensive to offer a premium product. 
They all agree that a single aircraft type is ideal. But unanimity is not a feature of the vibrant debate over the future 
of Indian aviation.  
GR Gopinath, chief executive officer of Air Deccan, is convinced that the secondary and primary routes in India are 
so different that you need different equipment for each. 
So the wealth of bankers, analysts, lessors and manufacturers at the conference, who are well aware of India's 
potential for growth, were left to decide who was right. 
"By next year's conference we may well know," said one delegate. "It's a reasonable bet that some of the players 
will have disappeared, but judging by the crowded domestic terminals, there may be room for more than one model, 
but only if the infrastructure keeps up with the demand." 
At least on the infrastructure question everyone was agreed. Well almost everyone.  n

Body
Budget airline Ryanair today said it expects its fuel bill to rise this year but is confident that higher average fares 
and a 20pc rise in passengers will offset the costs from soaring oil prices.
The airlines Chief Financial Officer, Howard Millar, said the company would continue expanding aggressively, with 
up to three new bases planned in Europe this year.
He said that the company faced another challenging year with fuel set to account for 38pc of total costs.
 "Our view will be that we will pretty much stay where we are. Fares will rise a bit, fuel prices will be up a bit and we 
should sustain some kind of reasonable margin." Mr Millar said that Ryanair would not resume hedging fuel costs 
until the oil price fell well below USD60 per barrel. He also reiterated guidance for a 10pc rise in net profit to E295m 
for the current year to March 31, 2006. Ryanair expects to carry 42 million passengers in 2006. Meanwhile, the 
airline also confirmed it is in discussions with two potential partners on in-flight gambling. An announcement is 
expected in the first quarter of 2006/07. In-flight mobile phone services are also to be available within the next 15 to

Body
I am a Ryanair pilot and I believe your recent coverage about rostering has been influenced by Ryanair 
management misinformation (Flight International, 14-20 March).
My assessment of the situation within Ryanair’s pilot community is that there is massive discontent among pilots 
about the new rostering “proposal”. The pilot mood at most bases is not as Ryanair management portray it and 
there is little, if any, real negotiation.
Among the issues which disturb pilots are:
n a lack of trust in Ryanair management’s motives, based on previous experiences;
n arbitrary changes made by management to previous “agreements”, without negotiation or consultation;
n the fact that the five days on/four days off offer is heavily qualified by clauses that it makes it counterproductive to 
productivity;
n the fact that the offer incorporates the entitlement to change it to 5/2 or 5/3 should Ryanair management wish to 
do so, without consultation;
n the fact that the 5/4 offer is sure to bring roster instability for pilots, but not for Ryanair;
n the fact that the offer is accompanied by other items that amount to a pay decrease, even though Ryanair 
management would have us believe that a pay increase is being offered.
The reduction in pay for marginal pilot groups (second officers and newly promoted captains), which is seen as a 
penalising of those who wish to continue employment within Ryanair and of those who wish to progress within the 
organisation. I also believe this is a wedge that will lead to further reductions in future.
In my opinion Ryanair management seriously misjudged the mood of the pilot family. Outright rejection of this offer 
is under way and is apparent at most bases.

British no-frills airline, BMI, is suffering a collapse in passenger numbers as it loses out against rivals EasyJet and 
Ireland's Ryanair.
Leaked figures obtained by the Guardian in London show that the privately owned airline's flights from Heathrow 
carried 13pc fewer people in February than they did a year ago.
Its most intensive routes between London and Scotland suffered the most dramatic slump in popularity.
 Passenger numbers on its Glasgow flights dived by 24pc to 37,352 and the number of travellers on its Edinburgh 
flights fell by 17pc to 44,760. The airline insists that it is unconcerned by its shrinking customer base, which it says 
is a result of a change in policy to concentrate on price rather than volume. But the figures are likely to raise 
questions about BMI's strategy, launched last May, which involved axing free food and business-class cabins on 
many of its flights. The change was on the basis that it was "over-delivering" on customers' expectations. The 
airline introduced a complex pricing structure with three types of ticket depending on the level of service required by 
travellers.

Shannon based charter airline Eirjet has avoided the threat of being wound up by paying a debt it owed to an 
airport.
The High Court had been preparing to hear a petition today from Durham Tees Valley Airport to wind up the airline.
The petition has been withdrawn following the payment of the debt in full.
 Eirjet was founded by ex-Ryanair accountant Paul Schutz and a number of former directors from the Irish airline 
Skynet, which went into examinership last year. Schutz told the Sunday Tribune that the dispute was "a hiccup" 
over a debt which had "got further than it should have". While declining to reveal the exact sum invoved, he said 
"we are certainly not talking six figure sums".

Body
Chambers Ireland's Air Transport Users Council (ATUC) today called for Aer Lingus be privatised as soon as 
possible to protect the future of the airline.
It said that delays and indecision on investment in Aer Lingus has cost the owners of the airline, including the Aer 
Lingus unions, over E500m.
ATUC also called for the immediate part-privatisation of the airline to ensure no further money is wasted due to 
political interference and union inspired delays.
 Sean Murphy, Director of Policy at Chambers Ireland said, "had Aer Lingus been allowed to fund the aircraft 
purchases it wanted to make under Willie Walsh's leadership, then they would have cost E1.5bn instead of the 
E2bn figure now quoted." "Government indecision and union delay tactics have cost the company E500m - which 
equates to six years of current Aer Lingus profits. While our national airline flounders with diminishing profits, 
Ryanair has grown to a company that is more than six times its size," he commented.

Venezuelan aviation authorities said Friday they have not yet decided whether to ban flights by U.S. carriers though 
the U.S. ambassador earlier reported an accord to head off a ban.
U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield said late Thursday that the two countries had reached a temporary agreement 
to avert a potential airline crisis triggered by Venezuela's March 30 deadline to block most flights by U.S. carriers. 
That action was meant to protest safety restrictions by American aviation authorities.
But officials at Venezuela's National Aviation Institute, or INAC, said authorities had not decided to suspend the ban 
and were still discussing the matter.
Meanwhile, the president of the country's largest domestic airline called for Venezuelan authorities to follow through 
on the ban, saying it was the only way to get the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to lift safety restrictions that 
are out of date and allow fair competition in the Venezuelan market.
"I recommend to authorities to keep the pressure on," Nelson Ramiz, president and CEO of Aeropostal, told The 
Associated Press by telephone.
The FAA has had safety restrictions in place since 1995 that prevent Venezuelan airlines from flying to the United 
States using their own planes or from starting new services.
Two Venezuelan carriers, Aeropostal and Santa Barbara, are able to operate flights to the U.S. only by leasing 
planes from American companies.
That costs Aeropostal, which rents crews, mechanics and pilots from Ryanair and Falcon Air, an extra US$3 million 
(€2.5 million) a year, Ramiz said.
Venezuelan authorities are demanding the FAA lift those restrictions by upgrading Venezuela to category 1 from a 
category 2 safety rating, saying it has long corrected problems with airline safety procedures and the civil aviation 
authority to meet international safety standards.
Venezuela says decision on U.S. airline ban still pending
Unless that demand is met, Venezuela says it will impose the ban, which will prohibit all flights by Houston-based 
Continental Airlines Inc. and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., and restrict most flights by Fort Worth, Texas-based 
AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
Nelson said the 10 years of restrictions have benefited the U.S. carriers, which control 90 percent of the U.S.-
Venezuela market, at the expense of domestic airlines.
"We want to have a piece of that pie in that market," Ramiz said. "We have the right to exploit that market. It's not 
just a right of American airlines."
A team of FAA officials arrives this weekend to address the issue.
Brownfield warned last week that Venezuelan flights to the United States would be banned if Venezuela prohibited 
flights by U.S. airlines.
On Thursday he said that the "two governments have resolved, at least for the moment, the civil aviation problem" 
and that the Venezuelan government had decided to suspend the ban while the two sides address the matter 
further during the visit.

Body
Lufthansa AG, Germany's biggest airline, said Thursday it is offering a new fare to destinations across Europe for 
as low as €99 (about US$120), as it competes with low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet.
The Cologne-based airline said that, starting April 3, would-be passengers can book so-called "betterFly" fares from 
airports in Germany to all European Union member countries, along with Turkey, Switzerland and Norway. The 
price includes round-trip travel.
The fares will apply on 181 international routes and on 51 German domestic flights. Lufthansa said approximately 
350,000 seats a month would be available at the €99 price, which doesn't include a ticket service charge of €10 
(US$12).
Unlike its normal fares, the airline said passengers who use the bargain fare won't be subject to a minimum stay or 
advanced booking requirements. The tickets can also be changed, but for a fee.
"We have seen that an attractive starting price can have a very positive effect on the market," said Lufthansa Chief 
Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber. "We want to make our customers appealing offers and open up further growth for 
Lufthansa."
Shares of Lufthansa were up nearly 4 percent to €14.32 (US$17.28) in Frankfurt trading after the airline said 
Wednesday that its 2005 net profit rose to €453 million (US$546.73 million) from €404 million in 2004.
Operating profit rose by 51 percent to €577 million (US$696.38 million) from €383 million.

Travelers on British Airways PLC domestic routes soon will no longer have to wait in line at the check-in desk 
before catching their flights.
Beginning April 25, customers will need to go online or to airport kiosks to check in for their flights, BA said 
Tuesday.
The change comes as low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet have already made attempts at quicker 
customer service and ahead of BA's planned move to a new terminal at Heathrow, due to open in spring 2008.
"Making the airport experience simpler and speedier for our customers is the cornerstone of our vision for Terminal 
5," said Martin George, commercial director for BA.
The regular check-in desks will become areas to drop off luggage and staff will be available at the kiosks to assist 
passengers, who can print out tickets from home up to 24 hours before the flight.
Online check-in will not be available to those traveling with children or infants until July.
The airline said it expects 80 percent of its customers to use the self check-in system by the time it moves to the 
new terminal.
British Airways shares were up 2.1 percent to 362 pence ($6US.36; €5.22) on the London Stock Exchange.
Low-cost airlines, such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC have already begun introducing methods to 
shorten lines at their check-in counters.
In January, Ryanair unveiled a plan for all European Union passengers with just hand luggage to be able to check 
in online. Those checking in baggage would be charged 2.50 pounds ($4US.39; €3.61) per bag and must declare 
each bag when booking online.

The airline also said customers who print tickets from home will be given priority boarding and can skip lines at the 
boarding gates.
Earlier this year, easyJet announced that it was launching internet check-in for U.K. passengers. The airline said it 
had plans to make the online service available to 90 percent of its British customers by April, and it is rolling out the 
service to customers across Europe.
The airline is offering the option of skipping check-in at the airport only to those with hand luggage. The process 
allows travelers to "maximize every minute of their day" said easyJet spokeswoman Samantha Day.

As a child I used to hate going back to boarding school after the holidays.
The thought of my mother's food making way for the matron's burnt, mass-produced pumpkin; or of horse rides with 
friends making way for being beaten up by the "old boys" somehow never left me too excited.
Yet there was always one escape to look forward to: the night before lessons started, we'd all gather in someone's 
room and swap tales of memorable experiences we'd had in the holidays.
Coming back to Stanford after the winter break I was filled with excitement, rather than trepidation.
Here, I am surrounded by an incredible group of people and even microwavable food is better than burnt pumpkin. 
And, luckily, I seldom have to revert to it, given all the generous small group dinners.
Yet, the urge to hear what my friends had been up to was as persistent as ever. The "significance" of the stories 
was definitely elevated from those of my earlier years.
A British friend told me about meeting the presidents of both India and Pakistan in a single study trip.
An Australian friend told me about appearing on a national TV talk show during a studytrip to the Philippines; and 
an American had met two former prime ministers of Israel and climbed the Masada rock in Israel to see the sunrise 
during his study trip.
I certainly had my own stories to contribute from a great adventure to Argentina.
Unlike boarding school, where academic work took abouttwo weeks to ramp up, we hit it hard from day one.
Still fully jet-lagged as I walked into my first winter quarter lecture, I was suddenly jolted to attention as a massive 
bombardment of "cold calling" ensued.
Scramble begins for summer internships Back from the winter break, Hamish Fraser delivers the latest 
instalment of his experiences on the University of Stanford....
We had been warned about this phenomenon - where lecturers randomly call on a student to discuss the facts of 
the case or to present his or her analysis - although very little of it had taken place in the fall quarter.
It now went into full swing in a sort of classroom Russian roulette, with the lecturer pulling a card from a deck and 
revealing the picture of some unlucky fellow, while the rest of the class let out a muffled sigh of relief.
The focus of the core subjects shifted slightly from fall quarter, as we moved from the science of business to the art 
of business in subjects such as Strategy and Marketing.
With many of the cases still involving a quantitative component, there was also much more of a "magic touch" 
involved: Why was it so difficult to copy Wal-Mart or South West Airlines? How could Cemex and Ryanair take on 
big international companies?
It was soon clear that no spreadsheet analysis on its own was going to provide the answers to these questions, and 
the long debates that have ensued have been both challenging and enriching.
However, it was not the shift in course focus that gave rise to the sudden increase in cold calling, but rather the 
imminent arrival of a new distraction that would compete with academics for share of mind.
With the term hardly under way, recruiters started flocking to campus in their quest to scoop strong candidates for 
summer internship programmes - which is often a prelude to scooping strong candidates for full time employment.
Class jokers put on serious faces and the courtyard soon became filled with consultants and investment bankers 
scampering around in dark suits.
I watched the mayhem with some detachment. Working in Africa has made me aware of the tremendous value that 
could be generated in my home continent by buying out parts of large bureaucratic firms and turning them into more 
nimble units.
As such, I want to pursue a summer internship in private equity in order to see how these types of transactions are 
done in the first world. Another attractive summer internship would be to join a start-up organisation.
I have been passionate about entrepreneurship for many years and the resurgence of the Silicon Valley buzz, 
combined with all the stories of classmates that have started their own successful organisations, is certainly 
infectious.
However, both these industries do very little on-campus recruiting and require a more independent approach 
through informal networks and meetings. Not being part of the stressful hype was thus hardly a consolation, as I 
knew that soon the new recruits would be flown to lucrative "sell weekends", while I would still be "networking" to 
get a foot in the door.
With recruiting being the number one hype, there were certainly some smaller ones too. It took about two weeks 
from no one even thinking about it to the whole first year intake being self-selected into groups of three to six for 
second year housing.
Early groups secured current second year houses (through anything from connections to random draws), while 
unlucky ones started scrutinising the classified advertisement sections. Why all of this happened now - more than 
six months before we would be occupying those houses - certainly got the better of me.
Close to two months into the year I started getting that uncomfortable feeling in the bottom of my stomach. 
Networking certainly required the virtue of patience and I had yet to find a fitting summer job. The few attractive 
houses some friends and I hoped to get had all been booked. And everyone else seemed so settled and in control.
Scramble begins for summer internships Back from the winter break, Hamish Fraser delivers the latest 
instalment of his experiences on the University of Stanford....
Yet, as always, life was what happened in between it all. I enjoyed a fantastic dinner with my alumnus mentor and 
his wife. I joined South African friends in San Francisco for a braai (barbeque) to celebrate the start of our rugby 
season (watched over the internet).
I attended a stimulating conference on entrepreneurship and a factory tour to an automobile assembly plant. And 
these were but a few of the highlights.
During a long weekend, I visited the ski slopes near Lake Tahoe with classmates. Snow is pretty foreign to most 
Africans, and I had a lot of bruises to nurture as I settled down next to the fireplace after a long day of spectacular 
snowboarding falls.
Another weekend offered the opportunity to visit a friend (also studying for his MBA) in New York, my first visit to 
that extraordinary city.
This afternoon a classmate dragged me along to a talk given by a fellow South African on the World's Forgotten 
Diseases. Doing it more out of patriotism than out of any real knowledge about these diseases, I was struck by 
images of people deformed by lymphatic filariasis and children leading parents handicapped by river blindness.
It does put life in rather harsh perspective. In marketing, we are discussing the billions of dollars spent on erectile 
dysfunction drugs, and how best to position one drug against the other. Halfway across the world, a child is dying 
because he does not have access to 50 cents' worth of medication, as providing it to him will not always be in 
shareholders' best interest.
I begin understanding the fascination that a sizeable portion of my class has with non-profit work and suddenly my 
concerns about "no job, no home" seem trivial.

Ryanair has welcomed the Frontier Report on pollution caused by air traffic, which said that aviation accounts for 
less than 4pc of current carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
The report, funded by the European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA), of which Ryanair is a member, said 
that the figure contrasts with the level of pollution from road traffic, which accounts for 20pc of emissions.
The Report notes that airlines already have a huge incentive to reduce emissions given the high cost of fuel, which 
can account for over 30pc of their costs.
 "It is therefore not clear that inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) would have any 
impact on emissions and would only increase the cost of air travel for European consumers," Ryanair said.

With an air of entitlement that seemed excessive even for St Patrick's Day, Irish trainers filled the first three places 
yesterday in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, steeplechasing's championship race.
The winner was the 15/2 shot War of Attrition, who stayed on up the fearsome finishing hill to come home 2 1/2 
lengths clear of the 2005 Grand National winner, Hedgehunter, who could clearly have plodded on for ever. 
However, the winning jockey, Conor O'Dwyer, 40 next month, had enough nous to be sure that his horse had 
enough juice left to win.
So the Winner's Enclosure was filled, as so often has happened at Cheltenham this year, with what seemed like 
half the population of counties Tipperary and Kildare all hugging each other and doing their best impersonations of 
being simple bhoys from the bogs who had somehow, miraculously, put one over on the haughty English.
Even more than usual, this was an illusion. "Mouse" Morris, the rumpled-looking, chain-smoking trainer actually 
represents the peak of Irish aristocracy: his father was Lord Killanin, the head of the International Olympic 
Committee.
And the official owner, Gigginstown House Stud, turns out to be a nom de guerre for one Michael O'Leary, the boss 
of Ryanair, the low-cost airline.
He was the rebellious-looking figure with the tricolour round his neck which he removed sharpish when the time 
came to receive the trophy from the Duchess of Cornwall.
O'Leary is not always the most popular businessman in Ireland - "I'm surprised his horse wasn't an hour late," 
murmured someone in the paddock. But he did get a cheer as he left, shouting "free flights for everyone tonight", 
although it was not clear how anyone was going to escape the packed car parks in time to take advantage.
And O'Leary was graciousness itself in victory, giving all the credit to Morris and his determination to be patient and 
run War of Attrition sparingly.
Irish trainers take first three places in Gold Cup HORSERACING
"Mouse was determined to take the slow road," said O'Leary, "and every decision he's taken has been proved 
correct."
Irish stables took 10 of the 24 races at this year's Cheltenham, including the three biggest, the Gold Cup, the 
Champion Hurdle and the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Such a strike rate was once unthinkable.
Morris thinks it's no fluke. "Do you think the Irish can go on like this?" He replied: "We will as long as the economy 
in Ireland is good. There was a time when we had to sell all the decent horses."
Ireland's capacity to breed top steeplechasers has never been in doubt. Twelve of the 22 Gold Cup runners were 
Irish-bred.
They also provided the day's most conspicuous loser, Beef or Salmon, a long-standing under-achiever at 
Cheltenham, who was backed down to 4/1 favourite for the Gold Cup but finished 11th, without ever making a 
challenge.
Enough English racegoers saw War of Attrition coming to send them home happy as well. Punters do not go in for 
blind patriotism, what ever other stupidities might influence them.
But the Gold Cup was a blip in what was generally a good week for the bookmakers - if not for the fearless Freddie 
Williams, who reputedly lost Pounds 600,000 on Thursday to the Irish gambler J P McManus, and thousands more 
to an armed gang who attacked his Jaguar car with crowbars on the way back to his hotel.
But generally there has been a sense that this was far from a great Cheltenham.
The build up was wrecked by the death of the three-time Gold Cup winner Best Mate and injuries to several other 
stars including the 2005 Champion, Kicking King.
So the match-ups seemed in advance less mouthwatering than usual.
The death of nine horses, though seemingly attributable to nothing more than a random cluster of accidents, 
inevitably gave rise to the kind of questions that jump racing hates having to answer. "Regrettable," said the course 
managing director, Edward Gillespie.
It was also perishing cold, especially yesterday when the wind whipped across Gloucestershire with a fury that 
would have driven the crowds away from just about any sporting event other than this one. Last year, the Gold Cup 
was run in a heatwave that would have done credit to Ascot.
But in the second year of the Festival's extension to four days rather than three, there was a widespread feeling that 
people who used to go home wanting more, were now desperate to get away to allow their brains, livers, chilblains 
and wallets to recover.
Both the horses and the punters have only three weeks to freshen up before the Grand National meeting at Aintree, 
and it may not be long enough for many in both categories.
Even if many of the horses were not stars on Monday, however, they are now. Brave Inca lived up to his name in a 
terrific battle for the Champion Hurdle. War of Attrition, aged only seven, might well be back to battle Kicking King 
next year. And that's a prospect bewitching enough to keep all us madmen fascinated until then.*The Jockey Club 
is to review safety procedures at the Festival after five horses died on Thursday, matching the worst tally in Festival 
history on a single day.

As Ryanair introduces its 100th Boeing 737-800, the airline is preparing to begin disposing of its oldest examples of 
the Next Generation twinjet. The carrier has also confirmed that in the next six months it will launch a joint-venture 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operation in Poland or Latvia in conjunction with a major international 
third-party maintenance company.
Five 737-800s that Ryanair bought from Boeing in 1999 will shortly be put on the market, says deputy chief 
executive Howard Millar. This is part of a programme aimed at keeping the average fleet age low, Millar says, 
adding that the airline’s net fleet expansion will continue at the rate of 30-40 of the same type each year by 
exercising additional options to add to its already healthy firm orderbook for the type.
Millar points out that Ryanair owns 83% of its fleet, with the remainder on an operating lease. The carrier gains 
multiple advantages from replacing older aircraft with the latest versions of the same marque, including the fact that 
its initial agreement with Boeing gives it an advantageous price that now looks even more attractive than it did in 
1999, as it can buy the aircraft for a lower sum in euros. Meanwhile, its new 737s come with a five-year 
manufacturer’s warranty and cheap financing through the US Ex-Im Bank.
Ryanair says its partner in the eastern European MRO venture does not wish to be named, but Flight International’s 
sister on-line service Air Transport Intelligence has established it is Singapore Technologies Aerospace. The airline 
says the new maintenance base will be in either Riga, Latvia or Rzeszov, Poland. From April 2007 Ryanair expects 
to use it to carry out the C and D check heavy maintenance on its own 737-800s. In addition to that, the plant will 
offer third-party heavy maintenance on widebodies like 747s, but Ryanair will not have any equity in that part of the 
organisation, says Millar.
Engineering director Michael Hickey says the three- or four-bay 737 facility will be owned by Ryanair, but run by the 
partner company. He says there is a growing shortage of MRO capacity in Europe, which is “what makes this a 
good investment for Ryanair”.

Body
As Ryanair introduces its 100th Boeing 737-800, the airline is preparing to begin disposing of its oldest examples of 
the Next Generation twinjet. The carrier has also confirmed that in the next six months it will launch a joint-venture 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operation in Poland or Latvia in conjunction with a major international 
third-party maintenance company.
Five 737-800s that Ryanair bought from Boeing in 1999 will shortly be put on the market, says deputy chief 
executive Howard Millar. This is part of a programme aimed at keeping the average fleet age low, Millar says, 
adding that the airline's net fleet expansion will continue at the rate of 30-40 of the same type each year by 
exercising additional options to add to its already healthy firm orderbook for the type.

Pilots ponder Ryanair deal
Low-cost airline is offering a new rostering arrangement that gives flightcrew more time off – but is there a catch?
One of the many paradoxes about Ryanair is that, on the face of it, its pilots are well paid and have a roster that 
ensures they work hard but get lots of time off; but there is always dissent in the ranks. Meanwhile, the airline 
provides the lowest fares in Europe and as a result people flock to fill its aircraft. Yet the media seem always to be 
looking for the safety corner-cutting that they reason must be what enables the carrier to charge bargain basement 
fares.
The airline is negotiating with its pilots a new rostering deal that looks as if it will give them more time off (Flight 
International, 7-13 March). Despite this, the pilots still demur. Head of air and ground operations David O’Brien is 
reluctant to talk about the deal except to concede that negotiations are in progress and that their basis is a move 
from the present rostering pattern of five days duty followed by three days off to five on/four off. No other airline 
matches this kind of deal, so why do the pilots not snap it up? Chief financial officer and deputy chief executive 
Howard Millar agrees that the airline hopes to get concessions from the pilots in return for such apparent 
generosity, but again he will not spell out what sort of concessions he has in mind. For an airline that publishes its 
balance sheet and business plans on its website and is as transparent a business as anything out there, the internal 
machinations are more difficult to fathom.
Since Ryanair does not recognise trade unions, the employees can only make their voices heard outside the airline 
covertly, which makes the quality of the information provided more difficult to check. Reliable internal sources, 
however, indicate that some of the concessions the airline seeks in return for the 5/4 duty/time off ratio would – if 
agreed – entail designating some of the additional days off as annual leave or forms of duty that do not involve line-
flying, like recurrent training or medicals. Certainly the proposition, as it stands now, is represented thus on the 
Professional Pilots Rumour Network internet forum. As some pilots see it, any such agreement would reduce their 
control over their private time and not represent the net time-off benefit it appears to be.
No Headline In Original
The talks with the pilots are being conducted via employee representative committees (ERC) at the airline’s bases, 
says O’Brien, adding that the carrier also holds periodic “town hall” briefings for its employees about business policy 
and performance, which end with a question and answer session that is “usually robust”. The only detail O’Brien will 
venture is a generic statement about the constant factors in negotiations with employees: he names these as 
quality of life, money, and job security, and says the company is trying to reach a medium- or long-term agreement 
with crews that would meet their objectives realistically in the current business environment.
It is difficult to persuade the company to clarify its reason for offering a 5/4 roster. Millar concedes that the existing 
pilot rostering system is so effective in terms of getting duty hours out of the flightcrew that some of the pilots 
complete their 900h maximum allowable annual crew duty time in less than 12 months, and have to take the 
remainder of the year as gardening leave.
He suggests there is evidence of pilots who, when approaching the limit and therefore extended time off, “make a 
dash for the finishing line”. O’Brien, however, is unwilling to concede that this is a problem for the airline, insisting 
that Ryanair has never had a better crew/aircraft ratio.
But chief pilot Ray Conway’s own experience suggests the situation is not so simple. Conway acknowledges that, at 
present, he is doing more line flying than he usually does as the airline’s non-rollover rostering year approaches its 
31 March end. Crew pressure peaks in March because some of its pilots reach their 900h annual maximum in 10 or 
11 months, he says. Some pilots claim nine months is not rare.
If that happens, the pilots are effectively on holiday until 1 April. These absences from the roster are partially offset 
by low-season schedules, says Conway, but since Ryanair’s operations are not particularly seasonal, the 
compensation is not complete. A five days on/four days off ratio would, in theory, spread crew hours more evenly 
over a 12-month period. But none of the senior executives will confirm whether this is their primary reason for 
floating the 5/4 ratio.
Pilot shortage?
O’Brien denies the widespread rumours that the airline is short of pilots as a result of its rapid expansion. Conway 
was one of those who travelled to Seattle last week to take delivery of Ryanair’s 100th Boeing 737-800. The carrier 
has now retired the last of its 737-200s, and O’Brien says its fleet will be expanding by a net total of 30-40 aircraft a 
year.
The total firm order with Boeing is for 239 Next Generation 737s, leaving 139 yet to be delivered. To man the 
aircraft, says O’Brien, the carrier will be recruiting 300-400 pilots a year, but he claims the airline is not having to 
“chase down” 737 pilots and insists there is “no evidence that the source of [fully qualified] commercial pilots is 
drying up”. He concedes that for two more years Ryanair will have to hire some direct-entry captains, but then 
promotion from within should fill the command posts that become available. Conway says that in the last 12 months 
Ryanair has taken on 300 new pilots, and filled 150 commands and 40 additional training posts.
A sign of the times is that, at present, some recruited pilots do not have to pay for their own type ratings: these 
include direct entry captains and senior first officers who are judged to be ready for command within a short period. 
The latter might be turboprop captains who join Ryanair as first officers. But although they do not pay up front, the 
pilots are bonded to repay the training cost over five years. Low-time first officers still pay c25,000 ($30,000) up 
front for their type rating if they do not already have one.
The most recent “unfriendly” press coup against Ryanair was accomplished by UK television’s Channel 4 in its 
Dispatches documentary in February. Channel 4 managed to embed some of its reporters with the airline as cabin 
crew and covertly film day to day scenes. This revealed some serious failures in the cabin crew training 
organisation, which implied that the system was set up so no-one could fail the course. Also, some inaccurate 
technical information was provided to cabin crews by training staff, and there were shortcomings in passenger 
identity checks at some boarding gates.
No Headline In Original
The programme showed the difficulties for cabin crew in clearing and cleaning the cabin during Ryanair’s trademark 
25min turnarounds. But generally the programme’s revelations were unsensational. Millar comments on how “the 
Dispatches programme ran like wildfire through the organisation”, noting it had sharpened up some crew 
procedures “better than any company briefing could do”.
The one thing that no-one argues about is Ryanair’s business success. Its results feel relentlessly predictable: the 
last reported quarter showed passengers up 26%, revenues up 27% and a 20% net profit margin. Ryanair is 
certainly a fearsome, unstoppable machine as seen by its competitors, and Millar observes that “there are still vast 
swathes of Europe we don’t cover”. Millar says rivals have “been withdrawing from [direct or close] competition 
because there is no point”. So far its growth has not been affected by the fuel price spiral, but Millar points out that 
its fuel price hedging arrangements are just about to end and will resume “when the opportunity arises”. Meanwhile, 
fuel – which Howard says is now 35% of the airline’s total cost base – has pushed total unit costs up by 7%. This 
does not alter the fact that its cost per passenger journey – at c39 – was still the lowest in the market by far in the 
final quarter of 2005, and its revenue per passenger exceeded that by c9.
Conway calls the airline “a well-oiled machine”. Its operations model depends on predictability and, although the 
airline varies its employee contracts to take advantage of the different circumstances and costs at all 15 of its 
bases, the operational template at all of them is identical, he points out. Punctuality is one of the intended products, 
and Ryanair leads the on-time field compared with other European airlines, according to the Irish Civil Aviation 
Authority.
The operating system is simple. Each aircraft departs from its base on the first wave of flights early in the day, and 
by the end of the operating day all crew and aircraft are back home. There is no scheduled overnighting away from 
base, so flight and cabin crews get a more predictable family life than most airline employees can hope for, with 
rosters published a month in advance. Since all aircraft are at base overnight, fault fixing is easier.
Disciplined system
It sounds idyllic, but actually is highly disciplined with virtually no slack in the system. Turnarounds are scheduled to 
take 25min, and any delays are subject to immediate scrutiny. Pilots say if the cabin is absolutely full – the average 
third quarter load factor was 83% – 25min is impossible, and they rely on arriving early at the gate to achieve on-
time departure. If any aircraft become unserviceable, Ryanair has four standby aircraft in its fleet: at present there is 
one based at Dublin, one at Rome Ciampino and two at London Stansted.
Daily at 08:00 Dublin time, after the first wave of departures, which is completed within 90min, all 15 base 
operations chiefs join up in a conference call. This is preceded by each centre sending an email to the Dublin 
headquarters detailing performance. If there is an identifiable reason even for a one-minute delay it is discussed to 
see if a recurrence can be prevented, says deputy director of operations Shay Warren. Conway explains the 
purpose of this is not punitive; it is the system for fine-tuning the Ryanair machine. At 08:30 every Monday at the 
Dublin headquarters, all department heads meet Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary and review the week’s 
operational performance. Nothing gets missed.
This is the environment in which Ryanair pilots work. But despite the hard work, Ryanair’s predictable lifestyle 
through the five on/three off roster system still attracts applicants from all over Europe. The question is, why is 
Ryanair – the airline that gives nothing away – offering them a deal that looks, on the face of it, even better?

Airport operator Fraport says February traffic at Frankfurt flat at 3.4 million passengers

The number of passengers using Frankfurt International Airport in February was flat compared to the same time last 
year because of weather-related delays, operator Fraport AG said Monday.
The company said 3.43 million passengers flew into continental Europe's largest airport last month, up 0.1 percent 
from February 2005. The flat figure was the result of several flight cancellations from severe weather, including 
heavy snowfall.
But the facility's air freight total continued to rise, growing by 8.6 percent to 150,749 metric tons, or 166,172 U.S. 
tons, last month, making it the busiest February for freight in the airport's history. The increases were heaviest in 
traffic heading to the Middle East, the Pacific and Africa.
Overall, the number of takeoffs and landings at the airport rose by 0.4 percent to 36,039, a slight increase that was 
held back because of the lack of military charter flights since the closure of the U.S. Rhein-Main Air Base.
Altogether, Fraport's six airports counted some 4.4 million passengers in February, down 5.3 percent from a year 
ago. The drop was mainly the result of fewer passengers at the Fraport-run Antalya Airport in Turkey where the 
number of passengers fell by 90.2 percent last month. The company blamed the opening of a second terminal at 
the airport and a lack of tourists concerned about avian flu.
Peru's Lima Airport had 435,784 passengers last month, up 5.2 percent from a year ago, while traffic at Frankfurt-
Hahn Airport, where low-cost carrier Ryanair operates, saw its numbers rise 17.5 percent to 224,606 passengers in 
February. Traffic at Hannover Airport rose 3.4 percent while the number of passengers at Saarbruecken Airport 
declined by 14.6 percent to 18,253 passengers.
Fraport shares rose more than half a percent to €65.06 (US$77.54) in Frankfurt trading.

A former senior Ryanair figure has raised more than 84m euro for a low cost domestic airline in the US, according 
to a weekend report.
Dubliner Charlie Clifton was Ryanair's director of ground and in-flight operations until December 2002.
According to the Sunday Business Post he is now helping to set up Skybus from a base in Columbus, Ohio.
 Skybus plans to start flying later this year, running up to 10 domestic US routes with a fleet of nine planes. It will 
use slef service check ins and only accept online bookings, the paper says. Clifton has declined to comment on his

Michael O'Leary was the picture of establishment correctness in regulation black tie for this week's Airport 
Operators Association dinner at the Park Lane London Hilton.
His sober attire was misleading. "Speaking to you tonight is like making love to Camilla Parker Bowles," said 
Ryanair's self-styled "poor Paddy" chief executive, one of Ireland's 10 richest citizens. "It's a terrific honour, I'm just 
not sure how much fun this is going to be."
O'Leary certainly had fun but his audience of airport and airline executives, bankers, politicians and regulators 
found it hard to decide whether to laugh or squirm. Most did both.
BAA and the UK and European regulators came off worst. "We have a monopoly owning most airports in London 
and Scotland. We believe it should be broken up and spun off to shareholders," said O'Leary. "We would like to free 
the Scottish Three." Heathrow should be freed to compete with Paris and Frankfurt. "Let Stansted be run like it 
should be run. Efficiently."
He added: "Instead we have a regulatory mess and a half-assed agreement to develop Stansted first and Gatwick 
not at all. Sack the regulators, they are inept."
O'Leary next turned his guns to "the mindless morons of Brussels". Here, he thought airlines and airports should 
work together to counter the "lunatic, insane crap" coming from European Union bureaucrats whether on passenger 
compensation or environmental relief.
"We are all in favour of reducing emissions but we are not prepared to do shag-all about it. Look at all the SUVs 
outside Sainsbury at the weekend, and not a word is said against them."
His own vision of the future was for a Ryanair flying 200m passengers a year virtually for free, except for taxes, fees 
and charges: "We will get money somewhere else."
In Oscars week, O'Leary made his own awards. They included "Most Promising Newcomer: Ferrovial."

British Airways PLC, which is facing tough competition from budget airlines and coping with surging fuel costs, 
announced another cost-cutting program Thursday.
BA said it plans to reduce costs by 450 million pounds ($780 million) over the next two years in a move that is likely 
to lead to further job losses.
The carrier also said that its fuel bill for 2006-2007 was forecast to rise 400 million pounds ($695 million) to 2 billion 
pounds ($3.5 billion, adding that the fuel surcharge remained under "constant review."
However, Chief Executive Willie Walsh said later at an analyst and investor meeting that he has no plans to adjust 
the fuel surcharges on either long-haul or short-haul tickets.
BA has progressively increased surcharges as oil prices soared over the past year. In contrast, budget airlines such 
as Ryanair Holdings PLC have imposed no extra fuel charges on passengers, a decision they claim have helped 
keep prices low and win customers from the full-service airlines.
BA said revenue growth for 2006-2007 was forecast between 4 percent and 5 percent. Total costs for 2006-2007, 
excluding fuel, were forecast to be flat with increases offset by cost efficiencies.
The savings target and the fuel forecast were part of the 2006-2008 business plan unveiled to analysts and 
investors. It was greeted positively by the market and the airline's shares rose 3.8 percent to 3.29 pounds ($5.71).
The airline also said it plans to invest nearly 200 million pounds ($350 million) on its booking Web site and new on-
board services, including a new Club World seat and on-demand films in all cabins.
"This plan will make us fit for the future," said Chief Executive Willie Walsh. "Better management of our costs and 
having an absolute focus on customer needs will give us a lasting platform for success."
British Airways announces new cost-cutting program, job losses likely
The airline said the plans could lead to job losses, which would add to cuts already announced. The carrier said in 
November that it would cut its management force by 35 percent, or about 600 jobs, by 2008 as part of an earlier bid 
to trim costs by 300 million pounds ($520 million), the carrier said.
Walsh said that BA has secured delivery slots with Boeing Co. for 10 Boeing 777 aircraft starting from the end of 
2008 for its long-haul fleet where it makes the majority of its profit.
Walsh said the move will enable BA to "secure availability of additional capacity."
However, he added that a commercial order would require the airline to successfully address its large pension 
deficit, push through its 2006-2008 business plan and see sufficient demand going forward.
BA is in the process of tackling its 1.3 billion pound ($2.3 billion) final salary deficit.
The business plan covers the period up to March 2008 when the airline moves nearly all its operations into the new 
Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport. The terminal is still under construction.

Ryanair is to cut its Liverpool-Cork route from seven to four flights a week, it has announced.
The airline has blamed increased costs at the airport for the move and says that Cork Airport Authority has 
introduced 38 new costs at the airport.
These increases are a direct result of the debt the airport has inherited from its new terminal, it added. 
 Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley said the cost of building the new Cork terminal had made the 
airport "massively uncompetitive" against its peer airports throughout Europe. The company announced plans to 
switch flights to Kerry, where it will now run a service to Liverpool three times a week. Ryanair shares closed down 
6 cent to E7.73 on the ISEQ yesterday evening.

German budget airline Air Berlin said Wednesday that it plans to float its shares on the stock exchange to 
strengthen its position in the European travel market.
"We are going on the stock market because we want to realize our market opportunities," chief executive Joachim 
Hunold told reporters at a travel fair in Berlin.
"If we want to continue to grow amid stiff European competition, we have to position ourselves accordingly on the 
capital side," Hunold said.
The company will decide the date of the initial public offering on the Frankfurt stock exchange with its bankers, 
Hunold said. He didn't say how much the offering might raise.
Air Berlin, which flies to about 50 European, Tunisian and Egyptian destinations, is already Germany's second-
largest airline by passenger revenue behind Deutsche Lufthansa AG, but remains smaller than European budget 
rivals Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC.
Hunold said budget airlines could double their share of the European air travel market in the next ten years.

Body
No frills airline, Ryanair, today said it plans to cut back on its services to Cork Airport following recent cost increases 
there.
The airline said it plans to cut its Cork to Liverpool service from seven flights a week to four.
Cork Airport Authority recently announced a range of cost increases (38 in total) for various services at the airport 
including a 300pc increase in the rental charge of check-in and ticket desks.
 "These increases will push up Ryanair's costs at the airport by over E30,000 per annum. The increases, which are 
a direct result of the debt, which Cork Airport has inherited as a result of its new, Taj Mahal-like, terminal now 
makes Cork Airport massively uncompetitive against its peer airports throughout Europe and has made other 
destinations for Ryanair much more attractive," a Ryanair statement said. Meanwhile, Michael Cawley, Ryanair's 
Deputy Chief Executive, said that the airline will start a new three times weekly service from Liverpool to Kerry "as a 
much cheaper alternative to Cork".

Ryanair negotiates radical flightcrew rostering change

Ryanair says its pilot to aircraft ratio is as high now as it has ever been and denies widespread industry rumours 
that its flightcrew recruitment and training has not been able to keep up with fleet growth. Meanwhile, the carrier is 
in “direct negotiations” with its pilots about the possibility of a radical change to its flightcrew rostering pattern to 
which the reaction has so far been positive, says chief pilot Capt Ray Conway.
The airline’s head of air and ground operations David O’Brien claims that the airline is recruiting and training pilots 
at a rate of 300 to 400 a year to meet a fleet expansion of between 30 and 40 aircraft every 12 months. Last year, 
says Conway, the airline took on 300 new pilots, created 150 new commands and 40 new training positions. At 
present the airline has “more than the nominal nine pilots per aircraft”, says O’Brien.
Ryanair’s fleet currently consists of around 100 Boeing 737-800s, with a further 140 on backlog. For about two 
more years the airline will continue to recruit some direct-entry captains to meet the command requirements it 
cannot fill through internal promotion, says O’Brien, but after that time the airline’s cadetship and training scheme 
will have eliminated that need and all captains will be promoted from within. He insists, however, that there is no 
shortage of quality pilot applicants with full commercial licences.
Now Ryanair is engaged in “negotiations” with its pilots about a proposal to change from its existing roster system – 
five days flying followed by three days off – to a five-on/four-off ratio. Conway says the airline’s simple operating 
formula should mean that its pilots could continue to achieve close to 900h annually, but duty hours would be 
spread more evenly over the 12-month period.
Late last week the airline was continuing the roster negotiations with pilots from the employee representative 
committee based at the carrier’s largest single base, London Stansted. There would, says deputy chief executive 
Howard Millar, need to be some quid pro quo from the flightcrew before the company could agree to formalise a 5:4 
ratio, but he would not be specific on this until all the pilots have had time to react to the proposals. Many pilots who 
apply to join Ryanair cite its 5:3 work/time-off ratio as being one of the factors in their choice, so 5:4 would be an 
even greater incentive, Conway suggests.

 EasyJet chief plots a more profitable route Andrew Harrison is determined

After only three months as chief executive of EasyJet, Andrew Harrison is pushing out the boundaries of Europe's 
second-biggest low cost airline with the launch of its first routes to Morocco, Turkey and Croatia.
The extension of the low fare airline model from the UK to more far-flung destinations will support EasyJet's steady 
growth in capacity and passenger numbers by about 15 per cent a year. But investors will draw more comfort from 
Mr Harrison's commitment to improving profitability.
EasyJet's profit margins lag behind those of Ryanair, its Irish rival, and Mr Harrison, the former chief executive of 
RAC until its takeover last year by Aviva, the leading UK insurance group, said yesterday he was determined to 
narrow the gap.
Mr Harrison said: "We now make Pounds 2 profit per passenger. That is a relatively low profit margin, but the goal 
is Pounds 4 per passenger in the next three years. Ryanair makes Pounds 5 per passenger. It sells more heavily on 
their flights. It manages costs very tightly. There's no one thing that makes them that much more profitable. We will 
improve our revenues and our costs."
Mr Harrison, who last December replaced Ray Webster, the New Zealander who led the airline's operations for 
most of its first decade, believes that EasyJet can raise its yields (average fare levels) by attracting a growing share 
of business passengers, who tend to book later and pay correspondingly higher fares.
"The opportunity is there to market ourselves better, in particular to small and medium-sized businesses."
He said the EasyJet business model, with its greater emphasis than Ryanair on flying to primary airports, offering 
greater convenience and high frequency schedules, would be key to attracting more business traffic.
 EasyJet chief plots a more profitable route Andrew Harrison is determined to improve the low-cost airline's 
margins as well as increase its destinations, repor....
The main competition would be against the legacy network carriers, British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France and 
Alitalia, rather than against Ryanair, and EasyJet would be concentrating its expansion increasingly on a series of 
bases across continental Europe. It already has bases at Berlin and Dortmund in Germany, Basle and Geneva in 
Switzerland, and at Paris Orly, and its latest base at Milan Malpensa opens this month.
Yesterday EasyJet announced a move into new markets with the launch in the summer of daily services from 
Gatwick to Marrakesh and Luton to Istanbul, and four services a week from Luton to Rijeka in Croatia and from 
Basle to Istanbul.
Mr Harrison sought to play down any speculation about a takeover bid for EasyJet from FL Group, the Icelandic 
investor that has already built up a 16 per cent stake in EasyJet, and said there were "no significant synergies" 
between EasyJet and Sterling, FL Group's Copenhagen-based low-cost carrier.
He had met Hannes Smarason, FL Group chief executive, in January at EasyJet's Luton headquarters, but only "in 
the same way as any other large shareholders. It was a routine meeting. They are all curious to see what the new 
CEO is like".
Mr Harrison also welcomed the prospect of a takeover bid for BAA from Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, 
infrastructure and services group, arguing it could lead to a possible break-up of the BAA London airport monopoly.
EasyJet is the second largest operator at both Gatwick and Stansted airports, where it controls respectively 14 and 
20 per cent of the take-off and landing slots.
"EasyJet and Ryanair are the biggest operators at Stansted, and we are both vehemently opposed to BAA's 
business plans there. Where is the sense in that? Competition produces efficiency and that produces benefits for 
shareholders and customers."

Despite opposition by Montenegro Airlines, the official flag-carrier in the tiny republic, the Montenegro government 
has welcomed the idea. 
The introduction of low-cost airlines to the country would not be likely to take place until the Autumn, Vijesti said 
citing the preliminary report.
 Montenegro, which is heavily reliant on tourism, would benefit greatly from low cost carriers where it would boost it

The ISEQ index broke through the 8,000 mark in early trading this morning despite a bout of profit taking and with 
Ryanair leading.
By 11:30, the index was at 8,001.01, up 13.79 on the day.
While still a long way to go to reach the dizzy heights of a 52-week peak, which was reached in November of last 
year at 8,457, the index has been steadily rising - almost without interruption - for the past month.
 Banks and builders have powered the latest rally as the building boom at home fuelled record credit demand and 
heavyweights in both sectors have carved profitable and growing niches for themselves in markets as diverse as 
Poland, The UK and US. Banking stocks, however, took a breather today as investors consolidated gains with AIB 
shares down 2c to 2020, Bank of Ireland dropped 4c to 1497c, Anglo Irish Bank declined by 8c to 1381c and Irish

 At a press conference in Mexico City today, it was announced that the new airline - whose routes will not be 
announced until closer to launch date - expects to carry 1.5million passengers in the first year of operation. The 
airline is expected to begin operation in September this year with two Boeing 737-300's, with the aircraft fleet 
increasing to ten within two years of operation. The airline will cover Mexico City and other major Mexican cities as 
well as some cities in the US.

Low-cost European airline easyJet PLC launched Internet check-in for its passengers flying out of Britain on 
Thursday, a move that echoes the service unveiled by rival Ryanair Holdings PLC last month.
EasyJet said its remote check-in service is available on all routes from London's Gatwick and Stansted airports and 
Edinburgh in Scotland and is being rolled out across Europe.
Passengers with hand baggage only will be able to bypass queues at the check-in desk at the airports and will need 
to be at the gate just 15 minutes before departure.
On Wednesday, EasyJet warned Wednesday that a rising fuel bill will result in a larger loss in the first half of the 
year.
Combining the fuel costs with a seasonally weak first half because of the late timing of Easter, the airline forecast a 
pretax loss of around 45 million pounds ($78 million; 65 million euroes) for the six months to March 31, compared to 
a loss of 22 million pounds a year ago.
EasyJet said it expects its fuel bill to increase by around 55 billion pounds ($95 billion; 80 billion euros). EasyJet 
shares fell 2.2 percent to close at 376.25 pence ($6.59), while Ryanair shares rose 0.7 percent to 7.61 euros 
($9.07).
EasyJet said the launch of its Internet check-in followed a trial in early February and the service should be available 
to 90 percent of easyJet's U.K. passengers by April.
Ryanair announced last month that beginning in mid-March all European Union passengers with just hand luggage 
will be able to check in online, allowing them to avoid lines at both check-in and the departure gate.
Ryanair's plan also involves penalties for passengers who choose to check luggage into the hold they will be 
charged 2.50 pounds (3.50 euros; $4.30) a bag.

Ryanair said last month that its service will be rolled out initially at the airline's main hubs in Dublin in Ireland and 
Stansted, just outside London. It added that the Irish, British and German governments and most in Scandinavia 
have already approved online check-in, and the airline expected governments in the airline's other destinations to 
follow.
EasyJet said its service had been approved by the British government.

Body
EasyJet, Europe's second largest no-frills airline, today said it is now offering online check-in on all routes from 
London Stansted, London Gatwick and Edinburgh airports.
The airline said it is also in the process of rolling-out the service across the rest of Europe.
The UK-based carrier said its move follows a trial earlier this month. It remains confident that by April, the service 
should be available to 90pc of EasyJet's UK passengers.
 Online check-in allows passengers with hand baggage only to bypass the check-in queue by printing-off their 
boarding pass from their own computer. EasyJet passengers who have checked-in online will be able to arrive at 
the boarding gate 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time. The airline said this is a more generous time 
than that offered by any other airline. Last month Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills carrier, said it would allow all 
customers to check-in online from March 16. A similar move was announced last year by smaller rival Flybe.

Body
easyJet, Europe's second largest no-frills airline and Ryanair's main rival, said its financial guidance for the year to 
end-September 2006 remains unchanged.
"Overall, we plan to achieve mid to high single-digit percentage profit growth in the current financial year," the 
Luton-based carrier's chairman, Colin Chandler, told shareholders at the annual general meeting.
In the year to end-Sept 2005 easyJet made pretax profit under new IFRS accounting rules of £82.6m.
 The airline expects to deliver capacity growth, measured by available seats, of 15pc, and a 3-5pc reduction in cost 
per seat before fuel. easyJet anticipates a "slight" reduction in total revenue per seat for the year. "Lower unit 
passenger revenues are expected to be partly offset by ancillary revenues, which will improve with double digit 
percentage growth supported by a series of new initiatives," said Chandler.

Luggage fee catches the attention of AirAsia chief LOW-COST AIRLINES
 Luggage fee catches the attention of AirAsia chief LOW-COST AIRLINES

The head of Malaysia's Air-Asia, south-east Asia's largest budget airline, has said charging passengers for 
checking in bags made "a lot of sense" and the practice could be introduced on its routes if it proves successful in 
Europe.
Tony Fernandes also told the FT that he expected a steep slide in the price of oil over the next 18 months to 
beneath the USDollars 40 a barrel, a 50 per cent drop from today's level.
Britain's Flybe recently introduced a Pounds 2 (Dollars 3.48) charge per checked bag, while bigger rival Ryanair 
has said that from March 16 its passengers will have to pay Euros 3.50 (Dollars 4.17) per item carried in the hold.
The new pricing policy is the most significant amendment to the low-fare business model in years.
Low-cost airlines say the approach will save them money, allowing them to offer lower fares for those who do not 
travel with checked luggage. They add the policy removes the unfairness of charging passengers with no luggage 
the same as those who are laden.
Mr Fernandes said: "I think that of all the things that I have seen recently that (charging for) checked baggage 
makes a lot of sense."
He added: "The passenger who brings less baggage actually costs the airline less, and those who bring more bags 
cost the airline more, and so there shouldbe some punitive element."
Should AirAsia adopt a policy of charging for bags it could encourage other regional low-cost carriers to follow suit. 
The Malaysian company has, since 2001, set the pace in the fast-growing industry in Asia.
Mr Fernandes said he was watching Ireland's Ryanair closely. AirAsia takes much of its inspiration from the Irish 
group; senior AirAsia adviser and shareholder Conor McCarthy spent four years at Ryanair as director of 
operations.

"I am sure that when someone out there said'We are going to chargefor food,' everyone said 'That's crazy!' And 
now that is the accepted norm," he said.
AirAsia has an extensive domestic network in Malaysia plus a growing web of international routes. The company 
has affiliates in Thailand and Indonesia.
Mr Fernandes said AirAsia had managed to adjust to lofty fuel prices, but these were destined to drop below 
USDollars 40 a barrel in the coming months. The bold prediction runs counter to many industry analysts who 
foresee prices remaining above USDollars 50.
"My gut feeling is that oil will come down to USDollars 40 (a barrel) within the next year and a half," he said.
Singapore-traded jet fuel - which trades at a premium to crude oil - averaged USDollars 72 a barrel in the second 
half of last year. It reached a peak of USDollars 85.36 in early October.

Mentioning Ryanair inevitably brings to mind Michael O'Leary, its chief executive. He is the subject of a paper by 
Stephen Brown, professor of marketing research at the University of Ulster, in Brand Culture, recently published by 
Routledge.
Brown argues that O'Leary's combative and dismissive attitude to customer complaints contributes to Ryanair's 
success: "When every other organisation is expressing its undying love for the consumer - love that promises more 
than it provides - being told to piss off is, perversely, much more honest and much more authentic, or at least less 
hypocritical. . ."

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC offered millions of cheap tickets Tuesday as it went on the attack against 
allegations in a TV program that it has been lax in respecting air safety and security rules.
The British Transport Office said it will follow up the security allegations with the airline, while French Transport 
Minister Dominique Perben said he has asked the French civil aviation authority to meet with its Irish and U.K. 
counterparts about the safety allegations.
The Channel Four documentary used two undercover reporters working as flight attendants to garner information 
that it claimed revealed lapses in standards, including passport checks, and overworked and undertrained staff.
Ryanair splashed out on advertisements in several British newspapers Tuesday with the heading "An Apology" 
following the screening of the documentary Monday.
But the "apology" was to rival airlines easyJet PLC, British Airways PLC and Aer Lingus as Ryanair released 3 
million "zero fare" tickets for travel before the end of May. Passengers pay only airport taxes and charges.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the allegations were without foundation and criticized the program for 
not running a Ryanair response in full.
"Ryanair operates to the highest safety standards in Europe," O'Leary said. "As always Ryanair will let the traveling 
public decide. ...The airline is confident that the traveling public will continue to support and enjoy Ryanair's service 
across Europe."
As an Irish airline, security issues at Ryanair, which says it has 40 million passengers annually, are policed by the 
Irish Transport Office and safety issues by the Irish Aviation Authority.
Budget airline Ryanair offers millions of 'zero fare' tickets in response to safety criticism
Aviation authority spokeswoman Lilian Cassel said that it "had not identified any areas of concern" as a result of the 
TV program or correspondence with Ryanair. The transport office did not immediately return calls seeking 
comment.
However, authorities in other countries expressed more concern.
Britain's Transport Office said in a statement that it "views any failings in security procedures seriously."
"We will follow up with the organization concerned the security issues raised, and take action where appropriate," it 
added.
Perben said he was taking steps because of Ryanair's "solid presence in France."
The ministry acknowledged that as Ryanair is a European airline, it does not require any special authorization from 
the French authorities to fly inter-European routes. Ryanair operates flights from several French airports to the U.K., 
Ireland, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and Sweden.
The French ministry said that Ryanair's planes had been checked by inspectors 33 times in 2005 and three times 
so far this year without any serious anomalies being found.
Ryanair has previously faced criticism for its advertising campaigns.
Last year it attracted more than 100 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority when it ran advertisements 
referencing the July 7 London bombings to promote low fares.
The ads, with the headline "London Fights Back," used pictures of World War II Prime Minister Winston Churchill 
and a speech bubble with an alteration of his famous 1940 speech, reading: "We shall fly them to the beaches, we 
shall fly them to the hills, we shall fly them to London!"

Arrivals
The beauty of Frankfurt airport, apart from the pleasing glass and steel design of terminal 2, is its closeness to the 
city centre. It is 12 minutes by train to Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof. City-bound trains run more frequently from the 
regional S-Bahn station below the airport (every five to 15 minutes) than from the fancy long distance one. 
Alternatively, take a taxi to the centre in 15 to 20 minutes for Euros 25 to Euros 30. If you are tempted to save 
money and fly with Ryanair to "Frankfurt Hahn", bear in mind that Hahn is virtually in Luxembourg, and is nearly two 
hours away by coach.
Where to stay
Frankfurt's most exclusive address, once it opens next month, is set to be the five-star Villa Kennedy, a century-old 
mansion just south of the Main river, which has undergone a two-year refurbishment by Rocco Forte. Also new is 
the striking circular SAS Radisson to the west of the city centre. Established favourites are the classical Frankfurter 
Hof, bang in the centre, and the modern Hilton, which overlooks the verdant Anlage.
What to bring
Weather tends to be pretty extreme, with snowy winters and heatwaves in summer, so pack a canny suitcase. 
Credit cards are becoming more widely accepted by the day, but many smaller shops still do not take them, so arm 
yourself with cash ahead of your trip or from ATMs on the ground.
Shopping
Frankfurt's main shopping drag, the Zeil, is stolid and often crowded. Worth a visit, nonetheless, is the diverse four-
storey clothing store, Peek & Cloppenburg, at number 71. Charming boutiques are dotted around the compact city 
centre - Faber-Castell, for a quirky mix of exclusive jewellery and coloured pencils, Rathenauplatz 1; Bitter & Zart, a 
characterful chocolaterie, is just next to the cathedral at Domstrasse 4; and for marvellous wooden toys, try 
Wohnen und Spielen, Grosse Friedbergerstrasse 32.
Pack a canny suitcase for Frankfurt FT writers advise on business hubs around the world
Customs
Business relationships tend to be very formal, with first names rarely used, even between long-standing colleagues. 
Tipping is routine but more modest than elsewhere in Europe. It is standard to tip in bars as well as restaurants. 
Common practice is to round up only to the nearest euro, or even nearest 50 cents, for anything under Euros 10. 
Beyond that, reckon on a little more.
Off-duty
Frankfurt quietens down after-hours, since many head home to outlying villages. Still, there are good music venues 
- the classically focused Alte Oper, the JazzKeller, or for rock, Mousonturm. The Alte Oper also houses a great 
restaurant, while other top-notch favourites are Italian-run Gargantua and French-run Knoblauch, both in the 
upmarket Westend. Alt Sachsenhausen, an historic district south of the river, has a clutch of traditional German 
beerhalls - try some "green sauce" with ox breast or boiled eggs at Dauth-Schneider.
Departures
Last year, Frankfurt became the first airport in the world to launch an automated self-service check-in service, 
potentially usable by all 42 carriers that use the airport. By the end of next month, the first eight kiosks in Terminal 1 
will begin operating on behalf of Air Canada and American Airlines. British Airways, North West, Gulf Air and Iberia 
will join the scheme when it is extended to Terminal 2 in the summer. If you are flying to the UK with BA, bear in 
mind that there is a double security check to get through. There are few cafes on the other side though.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has fiercely rejected claims made by undercover reporters posing as cabin 
crew for the airline.
Britain's Channel 4 is due to air the Dispatches documentary, "Ryanair: Caught Napping", tonight and it is believed 
the programme will contain allegations about safety, training, and passport checks, among other issues.
Speaking on RTE Radio this morning, however, O'Leary said the documentary producers had refused the airline's 
offer of a live interview and had also refused to air any Ryanair statement.
 He added the programme's claims had been given to aviation regulatory authorities in Britain and Ireland, who had 
found "no substance" to any of the allegations and were taking no further action. Ryanair published all 
correspondence between it and the program makers on its website last Friday.

 (ANSA) - Lamezia Terme, February 13 - Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair will launch a flight connecting Lamezia 
Terme, southern Italy, with London Stansted airport as of February 18, 2006.
 The flight will be launched under a contract signed with Lamezia airport operator Societa Aeroportuale Calabrese 
(SACAL).
That important contract will contribute to the development of the Lamezia Terme airport and provides direct, 
efficient and cheap connection to London and to the major hubs, the chairman of SACAL, Giuseppe Vitale, said.
 Initially the flight will be operated three times a week, but Ryanair plans to increase the frequency to four and later 
to seven times a week. The flight to London will contribute to a rise in the number of passengers at Lamezia Terme 
airport in both the leisure and business segments.
 In 2007, the low-cost carrier may launch a route between Lamezia Terme and Frankfurt, west central Germany.

Ryanair has sought to limit the potential damage to its reputation resulting from the planned screening on Monday 
of a television documentary that claims to expose security lapses, ex-hausted crew and dirty aircraft at Europe's 
biggest low-cost airline.
Channel 4 said that its Dispatches programme had conducted an undercover investigation into the way in which 
Ryanair operated using two reporters, who had spent five months secretly filming the airline's training programme 
and flights as members of the cabin crew.
It said: "What they found may make you think twice about flying Ryanair again. The undercover footage reveals 
what takes place behind the scenes: security lapses, dirty aircraft, pilots complaining about the hours they have to 
fly and ex-hausted cabin crew."
In a damage limitation exercise, Ryanair published on its website the full correspondence between itself and Steve 
Boulton Productions, the company producing the programme, Ryanair: Caught napping.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said 20 allegations had been made as the product of the five months of 
secret filming. The company had found no substance in any of the allegations, replied to all the claims and copied 
all the correspondence at every stage to the aviation safety authorities - the Irish Aviation Authority and the UK Civil 
Aviation Authority.
Mr O'Leary said he had offered the programme a live or an unedited pre-recorded interview to respond to the 
allegations but the offer had been refused. Channel 4 said the programme had offered an edited interview but 
Ryanair had turned this down. Instead it would broadcast an edited statement from the airline "to reflect accurately 
its position".
Ryanair said the Dispatches programme had made "a series of untrue and unsubstantiated claims, which they have 
failed to support with any evidence". If there had been any "isolated breaches" of its policies and procedures, these 
would be fully investigated.

Sir Richard Branson: "Sir Freddie was one of Britain's greatest entrepreneurs. He gave me a lot of very useful

before they bankrupted us - not after as he did. 'Sue the bastards!' were his exact words. Virgin Atlantic named one

Sir Freddie Laker, who has died in Miami at the age of 83, was not only one of Britain's most popular and 
flamboyant businessmen but he helped to rewrite the rules of international aviation.
His cut-price transatlantic Skytrain service, launched in 1977, collapsed in 1982.
But he had accurately foreseen that the civil aviation regime that had existed since the end of the second world war, 
dominated by state-owned carriers, fare-fixing and fierce opposition to new entrants, could not continue.
In spite of Skytrain's failure, Sir Freddie had demonstrated that offering low fares would open the market to millions 
of new customers who were happy to forgotraditional airline frills in return for a cut-price ticket.
Today's successful low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, yesterday paid tribute to Sir Freddie as the 
father of cheap air travel.
But they had an advantage he never enjoyed: the opening of the airline business in the US and Europe to greater 
competition.
While he recognised the low-cost airlines' achievement, Sir Freddie pointed out that their success had come on 
European routes. Sir Freddie's eye was always on the lucrative transatlantic market.
In that sense, his real successor was Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic. Sir Freddie was a great admirer of 
Virgin, seeing in it many of the qualities he believed Skytrain would have demonstrated if it had survived.
Frederick Alfred Laker was born into a working-class family in Canterbury in 1922. Fascinated by aircraft, he began 
work on the shop floor at Short Brothers in Rochester at the age of 16. During the second world war, he served with 
the Air Transport Auxiliary, where he learnt to fly.
Father of cheap air travel who was ahead of his time OBITUARY SIR FREDDIE LAKER
His first big business breakthrough after the war came with the Berlin airlift in 1948, when he used converted Halifax 
aircraft to ferry goods into the city.
He made 2,577 round trips and carried 11.6 per cent of all the goods that went intoBerlin.
He spent the 1950s engaged in various airline activities. In the later part of the decade, he sold his interests to what 
became a new consortium, British United Airways. He became managing director with Sir Myles Wyatt as chairman.
But he always hankered to break into the tightly controlled transatlantic market and, after a falling out with Sir 
Myles, he set up his new airline.
The idea was that fares would be cheap: there would be no frills and passengers could simply turn up and buy a 
ticket.
Laker spent years fighting for permission to operate until he succeeded in 1977. His cheap flights made him a 
popular hero. In 1978, he was knighted.
The late 1970s and early 1980s were difficult times for all airlines. The second oil shock hit the industry hard but Sir 
Freddie had his own problems. He was plagued by exchange rate fluctuations and had borrowed heavily to buy his 
fleet of DC-10s and Airbuses.
Two of his largest creditors, General Electric and McDonnell Douglas, considered converting their debt into 
preference shares but it was too late. Skytrain's debts were too large.
After several complicated refinancing plans came to nothing, the airline called in the receiver.
Although financial analysts concluded that Sir Freddie's problem was that he had borrowed too much, he believed 
he had been undone by a conspiracy.
He blamed British Airways and other carriers for deliberately bringing Skytrain down. Certainly, all the established 
airlines were happy to see the price-cutting interloper out of the way.
He was bitter at the way he believed Britain had treated him.
Even under Margaret Thatcher, he said, the country still resented success. While this might have been true of rival 
airlines, it was a little hard on the many in Britain who admired him and even sent him money when Skytrain 
collapsed.
He spent most of his time after the collapse in Florida and on his yacht in the Bahamas. He could not stay away 
from the airline business, however.
In the 1990s, he set up a new airline, flying between the UK and Florida, with an emphasis this time on service 
rather than low prices but it did not survive.
In the more liberalisedaviation market of today, Sir Freddie's original plans might have met with greater success. As 
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said yesterday: "He was ahead of his time." Michael Skapinker

Sir Freddie Laker, who changed the face of air travel with his low-cost trans-Atlantic Skytrain service that 
challenged the industry giants in the 1970s, has died. He was 83.
Laker pioneered the concept of cheap fares for the masses, and although his Skytrain venture eventually collapsed 
in 1982, he laid the foundations for the low-cost carriers that proliferate today.
He died Thursday at a hospital in Hollywood, Fla., said Mary Maino, managing director of Laker Airways/Bahamas 
Ltd., on Friday. Laker Airways/Bahamas was liquidated in August.
Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson, who named one of the planes in his fleet "Spirit of Sir Freddie" in 
tribute, said the ebullient Laker was one of Britain's greatest entrepreneurs.
"He was a larger-than-life figure, with a wicked sense of humor, and a great friend," Branson said.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the industry had lost "one of its greatest pilots," while easyJet 
founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou said Laker was "a true pioneer who inspired all of us in aviation to hang on in there."
Laker set up the innovative Skytrain service in 1977, giving passengers the chance to fly across the Atlantic as 
easily as catching a train. No bookings were required, and if a flight filled up, passengers waited for the next one.
After winning hard-fought approval from governments on both sides of the Atlantic, the first Skytrain from London to 
New York took off in 1977 in a blaze of positive publicity. As with today's low-cost carriers, passengers had to pay 
extra for food and drink.
However, the six largest airlines operating between the U.S. and Britain British Airways, Pan Am, TWA, Air India, 
Iran Air and El Al colluded to oppose the new service.
When Skytrain's parent Laker Airways ran into debt problems and was hit by the falling value of the pound, Pan 
Am's decision to cut its economy fares by 66 percent effectively finished off the budget airline.
Low-cost airline pioneer Freddie Laker dies at 83
Embracing the venture as an underdog, the public donated more than $1 million to keep the business afloat, but 
Laker Airways collapsed in February 1982.
Three years later, the British courts ruled that other airlines had used illegal price pressure on the company. British 
Airways and other airlines were ordered to pay Laker about $6 million and settle claims with his creditors.
Branson said that Laker's experience taught him a valuable lesson.
"He gave me a lot of very useful advice when I set up Virgin Atlantic 21 years ago," Branson said. "Perhaps his best 
advice was to make sure that I took BA to court before they bankrupted us not after, as he did."
After being a media celebrity for 20 years during his David and Goliath fight with both governments and major 
corporations, Laker virtually vanished from public life when his company failed.
He bounced back in November 1995, announcing the return of Laker Airways, flying a twice-weekly service 
between London and Florida, with Laker Vacations offering more than 20,000 holidays in the United States.
But the trans-Atlantic services never really got going, and Laker was reduced to flying a limited operation between 
the U.S. and the Bahamas. Services ceased altogether in late 2004.
In an interview with the BBC in 2002, Laker applauded the low-cost operators that followed him but said it was sad 
that none had gone as far as he did.
"I think it's great they are still doing it and have produced low-fare operators, but if you think about this low-fare 
operation in Europe and even the U.S., it's still on short-haul journeys," he said.
Laker got his start in the airline industry sweeping floors at an aircraft factory in Kent, south England. He went on to 
study aero-engineering and served in the Royal Air Force Transport Auxiliary before going into business for himself 
as a war-surplus aircraft dealer.
In 1958 his various companies merged and eventually became British United Airways, with Laker as managing 
director. Six years later he achieved his dream of owning his own airline with Laker Airways.
Laker, who was knighted in 1978, is survived by his fourth wife Jacqueline, who lives on Grand Bahama Island, and 
his son Freddie and daughter Elaine.

An Italian court today granted an injunction to Ryanair preventing their planes landing at Rome Ciampino airport 
from being diverted to Rome Fiumicino.
Since the beginning of January, seven Ryanair flights were subject to this diversion, forcing over 1,000 Italian 
passengers to land at short notice in an airport other than the one in which they had made arrangements for onward 
travel.
A further 1,000 had their flights the following morning delayed as aircraft were positioned from Fiumicino to 
Ciampino.
 Responding to claims that the diversions were ordered due to noise, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter 
Sherrard, said the airline was committed to using new quieter aircraft when landing at Ciampino. "We are now 
talking to ADR about a noise reduction programme for the benefit of the local community," he added.

Profit margins at Ryanair, the leading European low- cost carrier are coming under increasing pressure from the 
rising oil price.
The airline is also engaging in heavy discounting to fill its seats in the current quarter, as capacity rises.
Pre-tax profits in the third quarter to December 31 fell by 20 per cent from Euros 50.6m to Euros 40.6m (Pounds 
27.7m), although the airline said that underlying profits, excluding exceptional items, had continued to rise by 22 per 
cent.
The shares fell by 18 cents to Euros 7.54.
Some financial analysts lowered their profit forecasts for Ryanair for the 12 months to the end of March, although 
the company itself left its full-year guidance unchanged, forecasting an increase of 10 per cent in underlying net 
profits, excluding exceptional items, to Euros 295m.
Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive, said net profits in the current final quarter were expected to fall by a third to 
about Euros 21m, chiefly from the impact of Easter falling in April - a month later than last year.
Operating profits in the third quarter, before exceptionals, rose by only 1.6 per cent from Euros 48.4m to Euros 
49.2m. The result a year ago was helped by the release of a Euros 5.2m maintenance provision.
The drop in pre-tax profits was largely because of an Euros 11.9m contribution a year ago from a change in 
accounting rules for goodwill following the adoption of international financial reporting standards.
The airline continued to expand rapidly in the third quarter with passenger volumes rising by 26 per cent from 6.9m 
to 8.6m.
Pre-tax profits for the nine months were up to Euros 310.1m (Euros 272.1m) on turnover of Euros 1.32bn (Euros 
1bn).
Ryanair margins under threat from oil prices TRAVEL & LEISURE
Third-quarter turnover rose 27 per cent to Euros 371m, as ancillary revenues from sources such as commission 
earnings on internet sales of car rental, travel insurance and hotel bookings, outpaced traffic growth and rose by 31 
per cent. Yields - average fare prices - were flat during the three months.
The rising oil price had a heavy impact. Fuel accounted for 36 per cent of total operating costs, up from a share of 
30 per cent a year ago, and the fuel bill increased by 59 per cent to Euros 114.9m, reflecting a 33 per cent rise in 
the oil price as well as the growth in traffic.
Ryanair has only hedged its fuel requirements to the end of March, at Dollars 49 a barrel, and the airline is still 
unhedged for the coming financial year to March 2007.

Asimple lyric explains the dynamic driving so much innovation in today's post-industrial marketplace: "The best 
things in life are free."
Never in history has so much innovation been offered to so many for so little. The world's most exciting businesses 
- technology, transport, media, medicine and finance - are increasingly defined by the word "free". Whereas 
WalMart, the world's largest retailer, promises "everyday low prices", entrepreneurs and ultra-competitive 
incumbents develop business models predicated on providing more for free. It is a difficult proposition to beat.
Google charges users nothing to search the internet; neither does Yahoo nor Microsoft MSN. E-mail? Instant 
messaging? Blogging? Free. Skype, the Luxembourg-based company that is now a multibillion-dollar division of 
Ebay, offers free VOIP - Voice Over Internet Protocols - telephone calls worldwide. San Francisco-based Craigslist 
provides free online classified advertising around the world.
In America, the Progressive insurance group gives comparison-minded shoppers free vehicle insurance quotes 
from its competitors. Innumerable financial service companies offer clients free tax advice, online bill payments and 
investment research. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's colourful founder, predicts his discount carrier may soon offer free 
tickets to his cost-conscious euro-flyers.
Of course, Milton Friedman, the Nobel economist, is right: just as "there's no such thing as a free lunch", there is 
also no such thing as a "free innovation". These "free" offerings are all creatures of creative subsidy. Free search 
engines have keyword-driven advertisers. Financial companies use cash flow from profitable core businesses to 
cost-effectively support alluringly "free" money management services. Ryanair counts on the lucrative introduction 
of in-flight gambling to make its "free tickets" scenario a commercial reality. Innovative companies increasingly 
recognise that innovative subsidy transforms the pace at which markets embrace innovation. "Free" inherently 
reduces customer risk in exploring the new or improved - and bestows competitive advantage. To the extent that 
business models can be defined as the artful mix of "what companies profitably charge for" versus "what they give 
away free", successful innovators are branding and bundling ever-cleverer subsidies into their market offerings. The 
 How and why giveaways are changing the rules of business MICHAEL SCHRAGE
right "free" fuels growth and profit. Technology has successfully upgraded King Gillette's classic "razor & blades" 
business model.
All this freedom poses provocative challenges for global regulators and economic development champions. One 
company's clever cross-subsidy is another's anti-competitive predatory pricing. Ingenious subsidies inevitably invite 
invasive scrutiny. Look at Airbus and Boeing. American and European trustbusters certainly frowned on Microsoft's 
successful bid to bundle "free" internet browsers into its dominant Windows operating system. Yet bundling "free" e-
mail and other "free" online services into Yahoo and Google search engines was deemed legitimate. In trade 
competition, not all "frees" are created equal. Europe's proposed "Google-killer", the Quaero search engine 
initiative, for example, is itself a creature de subvention. "Free" competition with Google, Microsoft and Yahoo could 
prove expensive. However, regulators might argue that the ever-growing suites of cross-subsidised "free" digital 
innovations proffered by these companies unfairly compete. That is, these search engineers could take cash from 
their most profitable keyword advertising and use it to offer "free" Quaero-like multimedia searches. Good for cost-
conscious searchers, yes; not so great for state-supported competitors.
The simple reality is that technology will continue eroding entry barriers to provocative cross-subsidy. The more 
digital or virtual a process, product or service, the faster and easier crafting clever subsidies become. Scale 
matters, too. Global scale facilitates global subsidies. Just as advertisers subsidise free Google searches, 
marketers can easily download advertising-supported "free" songs, videos and games into iPods, Sony PSPs and 
Nokia phones. Internet-based telephone calls similarly lend themselves to sponsorship: "This free call from your 
brother inNew York is brought to you by Tesco . . . please press #1 to accept . . . " While that prospect will not thrill 
traditional telecommunications companies, consumers might appreciate the "free" choice.
Opportunities to add "free" value that matters in a networked world are expanding exponentially. Why wouldn't Ikea, 
the Swedish furniture giant with a reputation for horrible DIY documentation, want to post free instructional videos 
on its websites to make it less risky to buy its unassembled wares? By definition, successful companies are better 
positioned to subsidise such "free" innovation to deter potential rivals. Competing against "free" is hard. 
Consequently, complaints of unfair competition will multiply as innovative subsidy facilitates technical innovation.
The emerging "economics of free" thus creates policy quandaries for emerging economies. Do developing countries 
want to enjoy and exploit the economic benefits of "free" telecommunications and information for their citizenry and 
workforce? Or are "free" search and e-mail services merely post-industrial counterparts to the agricultural subsidies 
undermining a nation's ability to grow its own digital entrepreneurs? Might China or a South American coalition 
complain to the World Trade Organisation that a Yahoo and Google were effectively dumping their services in ways 
that unfairly hurt indigenous industrial development?
Certainly, the "free" market paradigm is finding its way into the business plans of local Asian and Indian innovators 
in telecommunications, microfinance and other sectors. The work of C. K. Prahalad, the US-based management 
expert, on profitably bringing innovation to the bottom of the pyramid has inspired even established incumbents 
such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble to redefine "free" promotion in emerging markets.
The rise and intricate complexity of government subsidies in public life is increasingly provoking political 
controversy. Similarly, the private sector's growing dependence on cross-subsidy as an innovation edge seems 
guaranteed to provoke a regulatory and litigatory backlash. Ironically, free markets create markets for "free" that 
conjure the spectre of unfair and anti-competitive subsidy. That conflict is inherently unavoidable. But while "free" 
has its costs, this century's economic reality is that the surest sign of dynamic innovation is a sector where 
everyone - producer and consumer alike - eagerly awaits what is offered for "free".

Ryanair Holdings PLC reported lower third-quarter net earnings despite higher revenues Monday, citing the soaring 
cost of fuel.
Ryanair said its net profit in the October-December quarter fell to 36.82 million euros ($44.22 million) from 46.69 
million euros in the equivalent quarter of 2004.
The previous year's third-quarter earnings included a 11.9 million euros ($14.3 million) exceptional gain from the 
purchase of rival airline Buzz. Excluding this, Ryanair's net profit rose 6 percent, slightly ahead of most analysts' 
forecasts.
Ryanair said its revenues rose to 370.7 million euros ($445.2 million) from 291.8 million euros in the third quarter of 
2004.
The airline said its fuel costs rose to 114.9 million euros ($140 million) from 72.5 million euros, but other operating 
expenses fell 6 percent, partly because of the use of newly purchased, more efficient Boeing 737-800 planes.
The number of third-quarter passengers rose to 8.6 million passengers from 6.9 million a year earlier, reflecting 
Ryanair's rapid opening of new routes and hubs.
The airline reported an average ticket price of 36 euros ($43.25), and collected an average of 7 euros ($8.40) per 
passenger in sales of food, beverages, duty-free goods and commissions on bookings for hotels, cars and 
insurance.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair's full-year forecasts for profits and revenue growth had not changed. 
He reiterated that the airline expected a weaker fourth quarter, citing the traditionally slow winter period and that the 
Easter holidays this year will fall in April.
O'Leary said Ryanair had added 34 new routes over the past year, raising Ryanair's total network to 303 routes 
operating from 15 bases.

"Our view remains unchanged, insofar as we expect that fuel prices will continue at these higher levels for some 
time," O'Leary said.
But Ryanair shares fell 3.1 percent to close at 7.52 euros ($8.99) on the Irish Stock Exchange in Dublin.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's fastest-growing airline, on Monday reported lower third-quarter net earnings 
despite higher revenues, citing the soaring cost of fuel.
Ryanair said its net profit in the October-December quarter fell to Â€36.82 million (US$44.22 million) from Â€46.69

Profit before tax at low fares airline Ryanair in the third quarter to 31 December fell from 50.6 million to 40.6 million, 
but increased in the first nine months from 272.1 million to 310.8 million.
Third quarter traffic grew 26% to 8.6 million passengers, while as expected yields were almost flat. Total revenue 
rose 27% to 370.7 million against 291.8 million.
Unit costs increased 3%, although if fuel is excluded they fell 6%. Fuel costs rose 59% to 114.9 million.
As a result of these significantly higher fuel costs, Ryanair's after tax margin, on an adjusted basis for the third 
quarter fell by two points to 10% as adjusted net profit increased by 6% to 37 million the company said in a trading 
statement.
Interim profit before tax at Albemarle & Bond Holdings in the six months to 31 December increased 12% to £3.34 
million from £2.99 million.
Income from pawnbroking grew 21%, from cheque cashing 16% and from pay day advances by 7%. During the half 
year the group acquired twelve shops and opened two new greenfield sites.
Forward orders at professional support services group Mouchel Parkman were maintained at the record level of £1 
billion and the bidding pipeline of near-term opportunities and contract extensions also sustained at £1 billion, the 
company says in a trading update.
The group is on track to deliver results in line with expectations for the half year and the longer term outlook 
continues to be good it said.
Medical innovations company BTG has signed an option agreement with the QRSciences Holdings subsidiary 
QRSciences Pty which will acquire its rights to NQR explosives and drug detection patents.
BTG will receive $500,000 immediately and, if the option is exercised, deferred payments payable in installments 
over the next 14 years plus contingent payments based on sales.
Total sales orders for the current financial year at specialist sofa retailer ScS Upholstery were significantly higher 
than in the same period last year, shareholders will be told by executive chairman Mike Browne at the annual 
meeting later today.
News in Brief: Yields flat as fuel costs hit Ryanair
Like-for-like sales order intake was up 4% in the first 17 weeks of the financial year.
Results for the year to 31 December at Havelock, the education, interiors and point-of-sale group, are expected to 
show a fourth successive annual increase in underlying profit and be in line with market expectations, the company 
says in a trading update.
The current year started with firm order books across all divisions and a significant upturn in the level of business in 
the education sector is anticipated it added. The preliminary figures will be announced on 4 April.

Ryanair boss Michael OLeary is determined not to impose surcharges on the 35 million passengers Europes 
number one low-fares airline expects to carry this year, despite the 59% increase in fuel costs causing a surprise 
slip in profits for the third quarter.
Profit before tax in the third quarter to 31 December fell from 50.6 million (£34.5 million) to 40.6 million, but still 
increased in the first nine months from 272.1 million to 310.8 million.
Although fuel was almost all fully hedged during the quarter, the total bill rose to 115 million.
But chief executive OLeary says the groups refusal to follow the European flag carriers with the imposition of fuel 
surcharges means that the gap between their high prices and Ryanairs (RYA) low ones remains.
Our no fuel surcharges guarantee to passengers has enabled us to launch 34 new routes, taking the total to 303, 
deliver significant traffic growth and higher profits he said. Ryanair now operates from 15 bases and flies to 22 
countries.
We are hedged to the end of March at rates equivalent to $49 a barrel said OLeary who expects the current high 
levels to continue for some time. We are unhedged thereafter, but continue to monitor forward prices with a view to 
hedging our future requirements for fiscal 2007 should an appropriate opportunity arise.
Ryanair shares fell 3.34% to 7.457 on the news, down 0.262. Around 4.4 million went through the market during the 
morning with 625 trades.
Third quarter traffic grew 26% to 8.6 million passengers, while yields were almost flat, as expected. Total revenue 
rose 27% to 370.7 million against 291.8 million. Unit costs increased 3%, although if fuel is excluded they fell 6%.
As a result of these significantly higher fuel costs, Ryanairs after tax margin, on an adjusted basis for the third 
quarter, fell by two points to 10% as adjusted net profit increased by 6% to 37 million the company said in a trading 
statement.
OLeary as usual uses the third quarter figures to attack a number of targets. This time he knocks the plans of BAA 
to build a £4 billion marble palace London Stanstead as its 75 million annual passenger forecasts, trebling the 
current capacity, has no basis in reality. BAAs budget, says OLeary, is a monumental waste of passengers money.
Fuel charges clip wings of Ryanair profits
All the main airlines support a second runway, but believe that this should be delivered at a cost of £1 billion or less 
added OLeary.
Another target is British Airways and OLeary makes the point that Ryanair carried more passengers a month than 
the national carrier did over its entire network.
Ryanairs new routes and bases at Luton, Liverpool and Pisa performed well, but Shannon again did not do as well 
as expected. The 14th base at Nottingham-East Midlands has been put back from March to April because of the 
late delivery of aircraft from Boeing owing to a strike.

No-frills airline Ryanair said its full year profit guidance remains unchanged as it reported a 6 pc increase for its 
third quarter.
For the three months to December 31 2005 the airline made a net profit (adjusted profit after tax) of E36.8 million, 
slightly below analysts' consensus forecast of about E38 million but up from E34.8 million last time.
This was achieved on the back of a 27 pc rise in total revenue to E370.7 million. Passenger traffic grew 26 pc to

The Dublin market closed firmly in the red today as Elan shares continued their rollercoaster ride and as Ryanair 
dived.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 14.17 points to 7,639.85.
Troubled Irish drugmaker, Elan, was a focus of attention today as investors cashed in following the publication of 
results for Serano, a Swiss manufacturer of one of the leading Multiple Sclerosis drugs, Rebif.
 However, a review by US authorities lifted investors' hopes that Tysabri will soon make it back on to the market. 
Goodbody Stockbrokers' analyst, Ian Hunter, said that, assuming a residual value of USD5.62 per share for Elan, 
without Tysabri, the market is currently valuing Tysabri at 4.2 times peak sales of USD1.9bn or USD7.98bn. Serono 
reported that quarterly sales of Rebif, which accounts for 54.3pc of the company's sales, rose 8.2pc to USD335.3m. 
This was, however, 5.8pc behind market expectations of USD356m and indicative of a possible over-valuation for 
Elan's Tysabri. Elan shares dropped 10c to 1270.

The Dublin market was sent lower in early deals today as shares in Ryanair nosedived following release of its third 
quarter figures and some hard-hitting comments from analysts on guidance.
By 11:45, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 6.64 points to 7,647.38.
No-frill airline, Ryanair, was the centre of attention on the market this morning after it said its full year profit 
guidance remains unchanged as it reported a 6pc increase for its third quarter.
 For the three months to December 31 2005 the airline made a net profit (adjusted profit after tax) of E36.8m, 
slightly below analysts' consensus forecast of about E38m but up from E34.8m last time. Unit costs increased 3pc, 
as fuel costs rose 59pc to E114.9m. Excluding fuel, unit costs fell 6pc. Goodbody's analyst, Joe Gill, said the figures 
helped to mask some underlying problems with its fuel policy. He noted that Ryanair's hedging of fuel at USD49 
helped the Q3 numbers but that Q4 guidance suggests yields are declining and that next year's results will be 
heavily dependent on how it copes with oil prices of around USD60 or more. Ryanair shares tumbled 29c to 743.

Increasing numbers of passengers on leisure flights are unprotected from the financial collapse of their carriers, 
MPs will warn today.
A report by the Commons transport committee says ministers were wrong to reject the advice of the Civil Aviation 
Authority that a Pounds 1 levy be imposed on all air fares to finance a protection scheme for scheduled flights.
Gwyneth Dunwoody, the chairman, said yesterday: "Plans for voluntary arrangements for repatriation are 
amateurish. Millions of air travellers continue to fly unprotected against the risk of an airline collapse."
The advantage of the levy far outweighed the "modest" additional cost, she said.
Carriers including British Airways and Ryanair opp-osed the CAA plan. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
said last year it was wrong for passengers booking on successful airlines to be asked to subsidise passengers 
booking with "financially flaky airlines and tour operators" because the CAA was not doing its job of regulation 
properly.
Air Travel Organisers' Licensing, the government's financial protection scheme for holidays and flights sold by UK 
tour operators and travel organisers, does not apply to scheduled services.
The MPs said 96 per cent of UK international leisure travellers were protected by Atol in 1996. It pays for stranded 
charter passengers to return home and refunds ticket holders yet to travel.
By 2004, that had fallen to 66 per cent and could decline to 20 per cent by 2010. Travellers are increasingly 
arranging their own travel and booking flights on scheduled low-cost airlines. The MPs say the collapse of EUjet, 
the Irish-registered carrier, flying chiefly from Manston, Kent, exposed the gap in protection.

British Airways PLC reported a 1.7 percent increase in third-quarter net profit Friday on the back of an increase in 
business and first class passengers.
BA, which is facing tough competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, said 
that net profit for the three months to Dec. 31 was 117 million pounds (US$207.8 million; Â€173.2 million), up from 
115 million pounds a year ago.
Revenue rose 8.7 percent to 2.13 billion pounds (US$3.8 billion; Â€3.17 billion).
"These are encouraging results which reflect better revenue and the continued efforts of our people to strengthen 
the business," said British Airways Chief Executive Willie Walsh, who joined the airline in October.
Walsh said that the increase in revenue was driven by increased traffic volumes in the premium cabin, boosted by 
"significant" promotional activity.
BA earns the majority of its profits from its long-haul first and business class operations, including the trans-Atlantic 
route.
The airline also revealed that its load factor, which measures how full its planes are, increased to 72.5 percent from 
72.3 percent in January.
Walsh said new routes such as Europe to Bangalore and Shanghai were doing well, boosted by strong marketing 
campaigns, and that "active promotion" of services was clearly paying off.
Chairman Martin Broughton said that BA expects revenue to grow by more than 8 percent this financial year, 
supported by yield improvement.
British Airways third-quarter profit rises 1.7 percent on increase in business passengers
However, Broughton said that "market conditions remain broadly unchanged as significant promotional activity is 
required to maintain seat factors" and that underlying costs, excluding fuel, are now expected to be around 1 
percent higher than the flat guidance the airline gave at the beginning of the year.
Fuel costs are expected to rise by 525 million pounds (US$929 million; Â€774 million) this year, he added.
Walsh said that the airline had no plans to adjust its fuel surcharges on passenger fares and cargo traffic as 
hedging remained in place. BA has progressively increased surcharges as oil prices soared over the past year. In 
contrast, Ryanair has imposed no extra fuel charges on passengers, a decision it claims has helped keep prices 
low and win customers from the full-service airlines.
Walsh added that the company is actively talking to Boeing Co. and Airbus but has no plans to order new long-haul 
aircraft at this stage. BA doesn't expect to take delivery of new planes before its transfer to Heathrow Airport's new 
fifth terminal in early 2008.
BA shares fell 1.2 percent to 320 pence (US$5.67; Â€4.73) on the London Stock Exchange.
"The company is performing well but significant uncertainties remain, particularly the unresolved pension issue and 
the move to Terminal 5," said Gert Zonneveld at stockbroker Panmure Gordon.
BA is in the process of tackling its 1.3 billion pound (US$2.3 billion; Â€1.92 billion) final salary deficit.
"The possibility of industrial action, which tends to be very damaging to airlines ... remains a real possibility," said 
Zonneveld.

 No hand-wringing about 'satisfaction'
 No hand-wringing about 'satisfaction'

From Mr Ashley Hildebrandt.
Sir, Tom Lester's article "The cost of not caring for your customers" (January 30) on dealing with unhappy 
customers was interesting and contained many insights. It does, however, rather gloss over the initial, implicit 
assumption that companies need to care. As he carefully outlines, the various remedies - keeping call centres in-
house, mystery shoppers and implementing a "satisfaction strategy" - are all expensive and deliver, at best, variable 
results.
There is another model: Ryanair. Colleagues who work in the aviation industry tell me that its safety standards are 
comparable with its peers, but in terms of customer satisfaction the company views price as overriding all other 
considerations.
As a long-standing weekly commuter on one of the airline's domestic services, I can certainly say that Ryanair 
offers excellent prices and has, frankly, a refreshingly honest attitude in dealing with customers. Its management 
and staff suffer no agonising and hand-wringing about "satisfaction". Passengers are self-loading cargo and the 
central customer service department is, as far as anybody can tell, a big hopper and the world's largest shredder . . 
.
Why refreshing? Neither party to the transaction has any delusions of "service". Everything is cut to the bone to 
provide me with a flight between Glasgow and London for an average of Pounds 50 return, which gets me a bus 
ticket. This surely goes to the heart of the matter - the internet and other pressures have brought prices of most 
goods and services down to a commodity level, yet consumers persist in expecting personal service.
Basic air travel, where the internet has surely had one of the greatest influences on purchasing patterns,

For British Airways and other purveyors of "prestige service",

The Dublin market lifted off again this morning as investors snapped up Ryanair shares following a healthy set of 
passenger growth numbers.
By 11:15, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 28.13 points to 7,63886.
Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, today reported that passenger numbers rose by 24pc in January. The airline said that 
it carried 2.538 million passengers in the month compared to 2.041 million in January 2005. It also said that it has 
carried 33.865 million passengers in the 12 months to the end of December. Investors were also encouraged by 
BA's reported net profit of £117m for its third quarter to December.
 Goodbody Stockbrokers this morning said that BA appears to be leaving the short haul market to its no-frills 
competitors - Ryanair and easyJet. Ryanair shares topped the leaderboard with a gain of 10c to 770. Banks 
bounced back in early deals, unfazed by the Finance Bill's proposed new tax reporting provisions together with 
lukewarm and disappointing SSIA incentives for pensions.

Court blocks Alitalia plan to acquire low-cost rival AIR TRAVEL

Body
An Italian court yesterday dealt a blow to Alitalia's strategy for recovery by blocking the airline's plan to buy Volare, 
a low-costcarrier that went bankrupt in 2004.
The civil tribunal in Rome said it had accepted the argument of Air One, one of Alitalia's domestic competitors, that 
the struggling national airline's offer of Euros 38m (Dollars 46m) for Volare involved illegal use of state aid.
Alitalia organised a capital increase of Euros 1bn late last year as part of a rescue plan that required the Italian 
state to reduce its stake in the airline from 62.3 per cent to less than 50 per cent.
Alitalia is especially interested in buying Volare because it would give the airline new slots at Milan's Linate airport 
and would open up new routes to popular Italian holiday destinations such as Cuba, theMaldives, Mauritius, Mexico 
and Sri Lanka.
Yesterday's court ruling does not spell the definitive end of Alitalia's efforts to acquire Volare, because Alitalia might 
be able to challenge the decision at a higher level - depending on how soon the Italian government wishes to see 
the issue resolved.
However, in the short term, the decision is a setback for Alitalia, which is only just emerging this week from a 
turbulent start to the year that involved widespread labour unrest and harsh weather conditions that grounded 
hundreds of flights.
Alitalia issued a statement on Saturday arguing that its bid for Volare would not burden it with significant amounts of 
debt.
It also said the acquisition of Volare would enablethe airline to increase its Italian market share, which has been 
eroded in recent years by carriers such as Ryanair, EasyJet and Air One.
Court blocks Alitalia plan to acquire low-cost rival AIR TRAVEL
Air One has put in a Euros 29m bid for Volare, and Italy's industry ministry had been due to consider the rival offers 
as early as this week. However, yesterday's court ruling could prompt the ministry to delay its decision for a while 
longer, according to sources close to the situation.
Meanwhile, the centre-right Italian government has convened a meeting tomorrow between ministers, Alitalia 
management and trade union leaders representing the airline's 20,000 staff.
Although the unions do not see eye to eye with management on Alitalia's restructuring plan - notably its efforts to 
hive off the ground service operations into a separate business - union leaders say theysupport the proposal to buy 
Volare.

Bag check-in to cost on Ryanair TRAVEL & LEISURE

Body
Ryanair is to start charging passengers for checking in bags as it looks to slash its baggage handling costs.
Europe's leading no-frills airline is also introducing an internet check-in system for customers with hand-luggage 
only.
It hoped the measures would encourage passengers to abandon the check-in desk and lead to Euros 30m (Pounds 
20.6m) of yearly cost savings.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "We will require fewer and less expensive facilities such as airport check-in 
and baggage hall facilities. And we will carry fewer bags making our aircraft lighter and improving fuel 
consumption."
Ryanair is the second European low-cost airline to introduce baggage charges after Flybe, the regional UK low fare 
carrier.
Mr O'Leary has described the checking in of baggage as a throwback to the "era of ocean liners" while some in the 
industry feel paying for the service is merely another step on from paying for inflight food and drinks.
Airlines also argue that charging will be fairer on the large numbers of passengers who already travel with carry-on 
items only.
Ryanair passengers are allowed to carry 10kg as hand luggage - which Flybe has estimated equates to "two pairs 
of jeans, two jumpers, one pair of trainers, four T-shirts, underwear (unspecified), a make-up bag, a toiletries bag, a 
belt and hair straighteners."
Ryanair will introduce its new approach on March 16 with any passenger booking after that date asked to pay 
Pounds 2.50 per checked-in bag.
Bag check-in to cost on Ryanair TRAVEL & LEISURE
The Irish carrier is planning at the same time to cut fares by Pounds 2.50 for all passengers. This means the 50 per 
cent of passengers who travel with just one checked in bag will see no impact from the changes, which Ryanair 
described as "revenue neutral".
From the same date, passengers travelling with hand luggage only and holding an EU passport will be able to 
check in on the web.
These passengers will be given priority boarding.
Ryanair expects half its customers will switch to using the internet check-in system, which will "significantly reduce 
the number of check-in and baggage handling staff required to handle individual flights".
Mr O'Leary insisted that job cuts would be "tiny", however, as the airline continues to expand.
He said Ryanair was preparing to open new European routes and was in "detailed talks" with eight airports, 
including two in Poland. The airline is also planning to allow passengers to start using mobile phones on its aircraft 
this year.

said Numis.
More detail is expected expected on the acquisition now that it has received regulatory clearance and the offer

Mudlark foresees tests of the law of unintended consequences from two initiatives yesterday.
It will be interesting to see if Ryanair's plan to charge for checked bags, while providing expedited boarding for 
passengers with hand luggage only, changes travellers' behaviour sufficiently to come up against capacity limits 
within aircraft cabins. And, if it does, how will the airline tweak its charging structure yet again to deal with it?
Potentially more embarrassing is Boots' initiative to allow people tested for chlamydia in its chemists' shops to be 
alerted to negative results by voicemail or text message. Even assuming the security is watertight, might not the 
failure to receive such a message - for whatever reason - be interpreted, prematurely, as signalling a positive 
result?

Ryanair to cut overall fares, but penalize passengers who check in luggage
Ryanair to cut overall fares, but penalize passengers who check in luggage

Body
Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC unveiled a new check-in system Wednesday that will cut 
overall fares but penalize passengers who book luggage into the hold and reward those who travel with just hand 
baggage.
In a move that will put further pressure on both its full-cost and budget rivals, Ryanair said that from mid-March all 
European Union passengers with hand luggage only will be able to check in online, allowing them to avoid queues 
at both check-in and the departure gate.
Fares will fall 9 percent or around 2.50 pounds (Â€3.50; US$4.30) per ticket across the board as part of the change, 
but those checking in bags will then be charged 2.50 pounds (Â€3.50; US$4.30) a bag.
"The costs of check-in will no longer be spread unfairly across all passengers," Ryanair Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said in London. "Passengers only pay for what they use."
While some full-service carriers already allow passengers to check-in online, Ryanair is the first no-frills operator in 
Europe to offer the service.
Under the new system, all passengers traveling with hand luggage and in possession of an EU passport will be able 
to check in online, receiving a barcode and boarding pass that will allow them to bypass check-in desks at the 
airport. They will also receive priority boarding, meaning they will skip queues at the gate.
Passengers wanting to take luggage will be asked to declare the bags when they book online and charged 2.50 
pounds per piece with a limit of two bags per passenger. If they fail to declare the bags when booking online, they 
will be charged a 5 pound (Â€7; US$9) fee per bag at the airport.
The airline estimates that lower ticket revenues and excess baggage fees will cost it 100 million pounds (Â€145 
million; US$180 million) a year, but it expects the move to increase passenger numbers and lower airport and 
handling costs by around Â€30 million (US$37 million) a year.
Ryanair to cut overall fares, but penalize passengers who check in luggage
O'Leary said he expects the changes to encourage more of Ryanair's passengers to travel with hand luggage only, 
but denied that the airline was attempting to move toward completely scratching checked bags.
Currently, about 25 percent of Ryanair's passengers have just hand luggage while 50 percent have one bag and 25 
percent have two bags. Based on a forecast that the airline will carry 42 million passengers in the year ending 
March 31, 2007, Ryanair estimates that it will earn 52.5 million pounds (Â€75 million; US$95 million) in baggage 
revenues from those with one bag and an additional 52.5 million pounds from those with two bags.
Ryanair has managed to grow exponentially over the past few years by dispensing with extras such as free food 
and drink, reclining seats, window blinds and covered walkways to its planes.
O'Leary said it was time to take the cost-cutting fight to the next level.
"We have done all the easy cuts like taking seat trays out, fly to out-of-town airports ... we have got to be more 
creative at how we tackle costs and we are now getting into larger pattern costs like the inefficiencies of airports," 
he said.
The service will be rolled out initially at the airline's main hubs in Dublin in Ireland and Stansted, just outside 
London. O'Leary said that the Irish, British and German governments and most in Scandinavia have already 
approved online check-in, and he expected governments in the airline's other destinations to follow.
Ryanair shares rose 2.4 percent to Â€7.90 (US$9.71) in trading on the London Stock Exchange.

greater traffic numbers as we aim to double the size of the airline over the coming five years," he added. The airline 
also announced it is to cut fares by 9pc or by E3.50. Furthermore, Ryanair is increasing each passenger's luggage 
allowance from the current 25kgs to 30 kgs (comprising 10kgs carry-on and 20kgs checked-in luggage) in a bid to 
reduce excess baggage fees.

The Italian authorities are launching an investigation into a series of flawed approaches flown into Rome by the 
crew of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800. The controversial incident has prompted the Irish Airline Pilots Association 
(IALPA) to question whether Ireland has an adequate safety oversight system in place.
Italian air accident investigation agency ANSV’s decision to investigate comes four months after the 7 September 
2005 incident because, it claims, it has only just been handed details by the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit 
(AAIU).
Ryanair’s internal report on the Rome Ciampino airport-bound 737 – the only investigation carried out so far – refers 
to the crew’s “almost complete loss of situational awareness, both lateral and vertical”, while attempting a diversion 
to Rome Fiumicino because of storms at Ciampino, ascribing this to high workload in turbulent weather and failure 
to follow standard operating procedures.
The airline informed the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and the AAIU that the event had occurred, but Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O’Leary admits that the carrier “screwed up” by failing to send them the final draft of its report.
The report says that, when the captain repeatedly failed to capture the instrument landing system on approach to 
Fiumicino, the co-pilot became concerned. “The first officer repeatedly prompted the captain to ensure he was not 
suffering some form of partial incapacitation, and when he realised that the aircraft was now in a potentially unsafe 
situation he urged the aircraft [sic] to perform a go-around, pulled back on the control column and advanced the 
thrust levers, but he did not assume control from the captain,” it says.
The captain had suffered the death of his young son a few days before the Düsseldorf-Ciampino flight, but had 
gone back on duty without notifying flight operations. Since then, says the report, existing instructions in the 
operations manual “for anyone who finds themselves in this situation” have been clarified.
The AAIU has previously reported that on 21 July last year a Ryanair crew carried out “an irrational and 
inexplicable” steep approach to land at Stockholm Skavsta airport, touching down at 180kt (330km/h) in the wrong 
Ryanair lapse sparks safety spat
configuration (Flight International, 11-17 October 2005). The agency attributed the pilot’s behaviour to stress related 
to family concerns.
Capt Evan Cullen, head of IALPA, says of the Ryanair Ciampino flight report: “There has been an excessive 
tendency to criticise the pilots without attempting to understand the situation. The report quotes no information from 
the flight data recorder [FDR].” O’Leary says the pilots had not “pulled” the data from the FDR at the time, and the 
report uses information from the aircraft’s operational flight data monitoring unit.
Cullen says: “While not commenting on any particular incident or airline, there is no doubt that the safety margins in 
Irish aviation have been eroded. The important question is whether we have in place the regulatory oversight 
system to alert us when the safety margin has been eroded to an unsafe extent.”
The IAA says it “routinely audits Ryanair’s line operations from the flightdeck and training standards, and follows up 
and investigates reported incidents in a systematic manner”.

Thousands of British expatriates who have made a new life in south-west France are receiving one French embrace 
they would rather do without - the attentions of the local taxman.
In an attempt to garner more tax revenues from the influx of British expatriates, businesses and holiday home 
owners, France has set up its first English-speaking tax office.
On Friday Thierry Breton, France's finance minister, will officially open the office, which has quietly been offering 
"facilities for English residents" in the Bergerac region since March.
It is the first time Paris has resorted to English to help boost the tax take, and a recognition that locally-based 
Britons could be an important source of revenue. If the move succeeds, more offices will follow in other British 
enclaves, a finance ministry official said yesterday.
Tom Kennedy, the British consul-general in Bordeaux, said that the number of British-owned businesses registered 
in the Dordogne region rose by 33 per cent last year to 372.
Low-cost flights have increased the number of British retirees and business people seeking la vie en rose in 
Bergerac. In the next four months Ryanair and FlyBe are expected to launch more routes between Bergerac and 
Nottingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Exeter.
"We're going to double the size of the airport," said Jean-Pierre Belves from the Dordogne Chamber of Commerce, 
who welcomes the influx of Britons, although it is fair to say that not all of the locals share his enthusiasm.
David Anderson, a solicitor at Sykes Anderson, who specialises in French tax law, said: "The French government 
sensibly is starting to make more information available in English and having more contact with English-speaking 
people.
"To a certain extent English speakers have a bad name when it comes to tax compliance in France."

Ireland looks set to be one of Europe's hottest economies again in 2006, despite earlier fears of a housing bust and 
concern its special low tax regime may be under renewed scrutiny by the European Commission.
Robbie Kelleher, chief economist at Davy, the stockbroker, says: "The Irish economy looks like it will surprise on the 
upside again in 2006."
The stock market should be one of the beneficiaries. The two big banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland - 
both under new leadership - are focused on extracting more value from their Irish franchise.
CRH has hardly put a foot wrong in its international strategy and from modest origins in the Irish cement market, 
must now rank as one of the world's leading building materials groups.
Ryanair's continued fortunes meanwhile are a mixed source of pride (as an Irish company becoming a real world 
beater) and begrudgery (the great Irish response to others' success). But with the World Cup in Germany this 
summer - Germany currently accounts for about 15 per cent of Ryanair's business - the company should be set for 
a good year.
Mr Kelleher believes the Irish market is cheap, trading at 12 times future earnings - based on a projected 15 per 
cent earnings uplift across the index. This excludes Elan, the troubled pharmaceuticals company that most Irish 
investors deserted long ago.
Anglo Irish Banks last week signalled its own confidence in the continued strong performance of the economy 
announcing it had completed a Euros 416m (Pounds 286m) share placing to bolster its balance sheet at a time of 
record strong loan growth.
In 2006, equity markets should also benefit from the maturing of the Euros 16bn of Special Savings Investment 
Accounts (SSIAs). These were set up by Charlie McCreevy, the current EU commissioner, when he was finance 
minister, as a deflationary measure to take spending out of the economy and encourage a savingsculture.
Stock market beneficiaries of a hot economy IRELAND
Irish Life & Permanent could see an increase in pension sales if, as proposed last week by Ann Maher, the 
pensions regulator, the government agrees to allow savers to transfer their SSIAs into their pensions.
Grafton, the building materials company, also expects to see savers, given the cash windfall as the accounts 
mature, spending on home improvements.
Independent News & Media, the newspaper group headed by Sir Anthony O'Reilly, could see a lift in advertising 
income as companies attempt to target this wall of money.
IN&M was in the news for other reasons earlier in the month when it emerged that Denis O'Brien, the 
telecommunications entrepreneur, had taken a 3 per cent stake, which saw the shares rise about 8 per cent.
Mr O'Brien and Sir Anthony are business rivals, with Mr O'Brien being outgunned in the battle to take over Eircom in 
2002 as the most high profile corporate encounter.
But commentators believe Mr O'Brien's move is not a prelude to a bid, pointing out that Sir Anthony and his 
relatives control close to 28 per cent of the stock.
One stock market rumour, which has not received much press coverage, is the possibility that this year could see a 
shake-out in the ownership of Ireland's main stockbrokers. The trigger for the speculation was the sale in November 
of Merrion Capital to Landsbanki, the Icelandic bank, in a deal that will see the Irish brokers pocket at least Euros 
55.3m.
The two big Irish brokers, Goodbody and Davy, are owned respectively by AIB and Bank of Ireland.
Many bankers are privately asking whether, given the valuation placed on Merrion, it is not an opportune time for 
the banks to offload their broking arms, which in many people's eyes have long looked surplus to requirements.

When Mustafa Kiamil has a problem, he does something about it.
In 1989, Jenny's Burgers, his family's fast food restaurant chain, had trouble getting regular supplies of tinned and 
fresh produce, so he set up his own catering delivery business.
Sixteen years later, JJ Fast Food Distribution is operating from a six-acre purpose-built site in an Enfield industrial 
park, delivering tinned and frozen food across a 100-mile radius.
Among its claims to fame, JJ is the largest distributor of chips in London.
The business model has some similarities to that of the Ryanair, the budget airline. JJ's fleet of 200 delivery lorries 
consist of just two brands, making maintenance simple. The lorries are serviced and refuelled on site, minimising 
the time they spend off the road. JJ's on-site 68,000 litre fuel store also means the company is less exposed to the 
fluctuations in petrol prices.
Efficiencies in vehicle operations alone adds another 6 per cent to the bottom line, according to Mr Kiamil, who was 
named this year's Credit Suisse Entrepreneur of the Year. "We have just taken a very old industry and done it 
differently."
Recently his problem became finding truck drivers. Changes in the rules for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) licences 
limited the number of hours drivers were allowed to be on the road.
The subsequent reduction in earning capacity has dissuaded many British workers from becoming truck drivers, 
encouraged existing drivers to change careers and made competition between companies that need drivers more 
intense, according to Mr Kiamil.
The driving workforce behind a successful food distribution  group Polish drivers have beenaboon for 
CreditSuisse's entrepreneur of the year, writes Jonathan Mo....
"It became unfashionable to be a driver. Those that would work were spoilt for choice, wanted double the money 
and would change companies at the drop of a hat."
As a result, Mr Kiamil started looking outside the UK for staff. The expansion of the European Union last May 
opened up the opportunity of employing Polish workers, many of whom had an equivalent of an HGV licence, earnt 
during national service in the army.
His Polish workers had an excellent work ethic. Some even worked for him while building their own businesses. But 
there were problems with JJ bringing people over.
Firstly, there was the language barrier. A key way that JJ tries to differentiate from its competition is through 
politeness with customers and friendly service, so the Polish drivers needed good conversational English as well as 
being able to communicate with the operational team back at headquarters.
Secondly, Mr Kiamil was concerned about experience on the road.
"We knew that their driving licences were correct but they often get them purely by joining the army and it didn't 
mean that they had driven a truck.
"A lot of our competitors saw they had their driving licences and just put them in a truck. As far as we were 
concerned, if they had driven before it was on the other side of the road and they might have just been behind a 
wheel of a tractor.
"We said if we are going to do this, let's do it properly." As a result, Mr Kiamil ensured that every Polish driver 
received a half-day's English teaching every Saturday and four weeks of lorry driving training.
Divisions between British and Polish drivers was also a concern, so the most experienced of JJ's existing hauliers 
were assigned an eastern European recruit to ride in their cab until they knew the ropes. He also insisted that the 
Polish drivers earned the same wage as the rest of the staff.
"We didn't want to make them feel exploited. They earned the same as other drivers throughout the training. But it 
was made clear that, if they didn't make the grade, then we would put them on as a driver's mate permanently and 
they would earn an appropriate salary.
"As time went on, they found out that other companies didn't do that and so that earned us a lot of loyalty from our 
drivers."
JJ started with a handful of Polish drivers and is now up to 70, more than a third of the team.
The intensive language courses have now stopped. "We found that we can be a little more selective about who we 
employ, so we now only take Polish workers who already speak English."
Staff retention has been an issue. About a third of the Polish drivers go back after a year of working for JJ to the 
family they have left behind, often having earnt enough money to build a better home back in Poland.
This is not necessarily a problem, Mr Kiamil says, since often those that leave will send a brother or a cousin to 
replace them. This is encouraged by Mr Kiamil.
"I know it sounds old-fashioned but work is about people dealing with people," he says.
"If somebody brings in a member of their family with a recommendation, they tend to make good employees who 
stay with the company."
Not all JJ's Polish staff return home. The company has had its first marriage between a Polish driver and one of the 
British staff.
The driving workforce behind a successful food distribution  group Polish drivers have beenaboon for 
CreditSuisse's entrepreneur of the year, writes Jonathan Mo....
As Mr Kiamil notes: "This is a family business."

Budget airline Ryanair has denied a rumour that its flights were subject to widespread cancellation this morning. 
According to the firm, its schedule of flights was operating normally, on time and with no cancellations. 
In a statement, Ryanair said the false rumour emanated from one of the London investment banks shortly after 7.30 
am. 
 "This rumour was untrue and could have been verified by that bank, had they made any attempt to contact the 
airline directly, or had they checked Ryanair's flight information page on www.ryanair.com, which confirmed that all 
Ryanair's early morning departures from London Luton and Stansted airport had departed as normal and on-time," 
the Irish low-cost carrier said. "Ryanair regrets that such a false and inaccurate rumour would emanate from a 
respected London investment bank without any attempt made to verify the facts either directly with the company or 
on Ryanair's website," it added.

Discount airline Air Berlin is mulling an initial public offering in the spring, the company said, with Dow Jones 
Newswires reporting it could yield up to 700 million euros ($840 million) for the company.
Citing investment bankers familiar with the airline's plans, Dow Jones reported Wednesday that Air Berlin was likely 
to launch the IPO this spring with Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley leading the effort.
The Berlin-based company did not comment on the details of the IPO, but confirmed it was reviewing the possibility. 
Commerzbank and Morgan Stanley did not comment on the report.
On Tuesday, Air Berlin said it had a 12.4 percent increase in passengers to 13.5 million in 2005, with revenue up 
17.1 percent to 1.23 billion euros ($1.5 billion). The company is a limited partnership and is not required to reveal its 
earnings.
Founded in 1979, Air Berlin has grown from offering vacation flights to Palma de Mallorca to becoming the third 
biggest discount airline in Europe, behind Ireland's Ryanair and Britain's easyJet PLC.
The company operates a fleet of 52 airplanes and expects to take delivery of nine Airbus A320s this year. Another 
49 A320s are expected by 2011.
Air Berlin flies to 48 destinations in Europe and North Africa.

British Airways would close or sell its lossmaking UK regional business, if it failed to become profitable within two 
years, David Evans, managing director of British Airways CitiExpress, said.
The airline yesterday announced the latest stage in restructuring the business in order to make an operating profit 
in the financial year to the end of March 2008.
The operation is to be rebranded BA Connect and be aligned more closely with the budget airline model of lower 
fares and simpler service levels.
BA flights out of UK regional airports to other UK cities and to Europe will abandon business class and all catering 
will have to be bought onboard.
The changes will not apply to BA flights at London City airport or on main services to London Heathrow and 
Gatwick.
BA Connect will operate chiefly from five BA regional bases - Manchester, from which it flies to 20 destinations, 
Birmingham, Edinburgh, Bristol and Southampton.
The airline is reducing its lowest fares by up to 40 per cent and will be selling about 2m seats or 40 per cent of its 
capacity at the lower fares.
The existing BA CitiExpress business handles some 3.5m passengers a year and is aiming to increase this by 10 
per cent to 3.8m in the coming year.
Mr Evans said that the business was already in the middle of a two-year programme to cuts costs by Pounds 35m 
in the regions by March 2007. No further job cuts would be made as a result of the low-fare strategy, he said, but 
the existing workforce of 2,250 was expected to be reduced further through natural attrition.
UK & IRELAND : BA regional future rests on being profitable TRAVEL & LEISURE
The regional business made an operating loss of Pounds 30m in the year to March 2004 and a loss of about 
Pounds 20m in the year to March 2005.
Overall, BA's short-haul operations in Europe are expected to return to profit in the current financial year to the end 
of March. This follows eight years of heavy losses totalling Pounds 1.2bn.
In the UK regions BA is facing fierce pressure from the still rapid growth of the low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and 
EasyJet, and including Jet2.com in northern England, Flyglobespan in Scotland and Flybe.
BA has pulled out of several UK cities including Plymouth, Cardiff and Leeds-Bradford.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at ABN Amro, said the mixed BA regional fleet of aircraft still had much higher unit 
costs than most of the rival low-cost carriers.

The European Union's highest court yesterday dismissed a challenge by airlines against new rules forcing them to 
pay higher compensation to passengers stranded by denied boarding and flight cancellations.
The rules, which came into force almost a year ago, have been particularly opposed by Europe's booming low-cost 
airline sector, because the new compensation scheme is not based on the original fare but applies a scale 
depending on the length of the flight.
In practice, that could force airlines to reimburse many times the actual price of a ticket, which EasyJet, Ryanair and 
others consider to present a ridiculously large financial risk for them.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents airlines and led the court challenge against the 
new rules, said the ruling marked "a sad day for Europe, for consumers, for international law and for the airline 
industry".
Iata has argued that the new rules could punish carriers for events beyond their control and would represent an 
annual cost of Euros 560m for EU airlines, over and above existing compensation.
For a medium-size European carrier, that should amount to about Euros 40m a year, or a fifth of its operating profit.
Giovanni Bisignani, Iata's chief executive, said yesterday: "Higher costs for air transport with no added value does 
not pass the good regulation test, let alone the common-sense test.''
However, the European Commission welcomed yesterday's decision by the European Court of Justice to uphold 
rules that were "good news for passengers''.
Following a gradual decline in overbooking practices, Brussels is hopeful tougher compensation rules will provide 
an incentive for airlines to reduce delays and cancellations, apart from in "exceptional circumstances'' where the 
airlines have no way of avoiding disruption.
Airlines lose EU case on passenger payouts
Lufthansa and other airlines said yesterday they would continue to push for a review of the rules.
But some lawyers warned that airlines could face even tougher penalties following a review of the effectiveness of 
the new rules, due to be carried out by Brussels by the end of the year.
Mark Franklin, head of the aviation group at DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary, an Anglo-American law firm, said: "I 
think this is entirely the end of the road for the challenge. The airlines now need to focus their efforts on maintaining 
the status quo, even if they don't like it, because it could get worse.''

Airlines lost their bid yesterday to overturn European rules forcing them to pay higher compensation to passengers 
left stranded by overbooking and flight cancellations.
The EU's highest court dismissed the challenge to the rules, which came into force almost a year ago and which 
have been particularly opposed by Europe's booming low-cost airline sector because the scheme is not based on 
the original fare but instead applies an escalating scale depending on the length of the flight.
In practice, that could force airlines to reimburse many times the actual price of a ticket, which Easyjet, Ryanair and 
others consider to present a ridiculously large financial risk for them.
The International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines and led the court challenge against the new 
rules, said the ruling marked a "sad day for Europe, for consumers, for international law and for the airline industry".
IATA has argued the rules could punish carriers for events beyond their control and would represent an annual cost 
of Euros 560m (Pounds 383m) for EU airlines above existing compensation.
Ryanair, Easyjet, British Airways and Lufthansa all refused to quantify what the financial impact of the legislation 
had been in the 11 months since it came into force.
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair head of regulatory affairs, said: "It has not had much impact because most cancellations 
are not under the control of the airline."
British Airways said the impact had been "minimal . . . People thought it would change the aviation industry for ever. 
It hasn't".
Airlines are still opposing the legislation, however, which makes them responsible for caring for passengers, 
providing food or accommodation in the case of cancellations outside their control.
Airlines left stranded on compensation rules TRANSPORT
Easyjet said: "Why are we paying for access to phones and computers, for light refreshments and putting people up 
in hotels, when the Italians close airspace around Rome for the Pope's funeral? We object to paying when it is not 
our fault."
Last November, KLM won a court case involving the new EU compensation rules.
The case - the first of its kind in a British court - concerned a Euros 250 claim after KLM cancelled a flight between 
Amsterdam and Newcastle because of a fuel leak, requiring the re-routing of 91 passengers on different flights that 
day.
The judge at Newcastle County Court ruled that the fuel problem constituted "extraordinary circumstances" beyond 
KLM's control and that the airline took all the necessary steps and could not have been expected to have had a 
spare aircraft available. But yesterday the European Court of Justice decided to uphold the overall legislation that 
led to KLM's challenge.
Mark Franklin, head of the aviation group at DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary, an Anglo-US law firm that represented 
KLM in the Newcastle case, said yesterday's ruling was "the end of the road" as far as airlines could hope to 
challenge the tougher rules.
He also warned that, encouraged by such a decisive ruling, the European Commission could decide to strengthen 
the rules following a review of their effectiveness, which is due by the end of the year.
"The airlines now need to focus their efforts on maintaining the status quo even if they don't like it, because it could 
get worse," he said.
Under the controversial rules, passengers can claim as much as Euros 600 in compensation if they are denied 
boarding. The rules also guarantee generous compensation for cancellations - except where they occur for reasons 
outside the airline's control, such as for reasons of weather or air traffic control, when airlines must provide care for 
passengers - and the right to a refund and a free flight home for a delay of five hours or more.
IATA calculates that for a medium-sized European carrier, the cost of compensation could amount to about a fifth of 
its operating profit.
Giovanni Bisignani, IATA's chief executive, said: "Higher costs for air transport with no added value does not pass 
the good regulation test, let alone the common-sense test."
Following a gradual decline in overbooking, Brussels has been arguing that tougher rules would provide an 
incentive for airlines to reduce delays and cancellations, apart from "exceptional circumstances" where they have 
no way of avoiding disruption, such as the wildcat strike that left British Airways passengers stranded last year.

European shares edged lower Tuesday as investors sold market-sensitive companies like insurers after the Dow 
industrials touched 11,000 for the first time in four and a half years.
Most European stock markets hit multi-year highs on Monday, but in Tuesday trading Germany's DAX 30 index 
finished down 0.7 percent to 5,494, the French CAC 40 index slipped 0.3 percent to 4,861, while the U.K.'s FTSE 
100 index closed down 0.75 percent at 5,688.
Resource stocks led decliners, including Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Also lower were technology stocks such as 
Infineon Technologies and insurers including Royal & Sun Alliance.
U.S. stocks ended higher Monday as a more than 7 percent jump in shares of General Motors Corp. helped the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average close above 11,000. However, U.S. stocks opened lower Tuesday as weaker-than-
expected quarterly results from Alcoa Inc. prompted some investors to lock in gains.
Retailers took the spotlight, with Germany's KarstadtQuelle up 1 percent and U.K. department-store giant Marks & 
Spencer declining 1.9 percent.
The gains from KarstadtQuelle came amid a report in the Financial Times Deutschland that said the majority 
shareholders of the German retailer may take the company private because it's worth more broken up than as a 
stand-alone company.
KarstadtQuelle dismissed the report as "pure speculation."
Marks & Spencer fell after the company reported stronger comparable-sales figures, but said that it expects the 
market to remain challenging. It is also facing increasing cost pressures after sharp rises in fuel, utilities, rent and 
rates, which will have an impact next year, it said.
Meanwhile, shares in Serono, Europe's largest biotech firm, gained ground in Switzerland after pharmaceutical 
Novartis walked away from a deal to buy smaller Berna Biotech, raising market hopes that it would buy Serono 
instead.
European Stocks End Lower
Serono shares added 2.97 percent, while Novartis lost 1.44 percent and Berna Biotech declined 8.31 percent.
In broker action, ABN Amro downgraded Nestle to sell from hold, with the broker saying its share price rise in 2005 
was the result of its Alcon pharmaceutical arm. Shares added 0.44 percent.
The bank also downgraded its recommendation on Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair to sell from hold, noting that the 
company's share price persists at levels well above its target price. Ryanair shares eased 1.54 percent.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank upgraded Italian eyeglasses maker and LensCrafters owner Luxottica Group to buy 
from hold. Luxottica shares rose 1 percent in Milan.
Several U.K. insurers were hit by a broker downgrade, with Royal & Sun Alliance down 2.4 percent after Merrill 
Lynch cut the company to sell from neutral and Prudential 2.2 percent lower after Merrill downgraded it to neutral 
from buy. Aviva was upgraded to buy from neutral. Shares eased 1.2 percent.

European airlines lost a legal bid Tuesday that aimed to strike down new EU rules guaranteeing passengers 
compensation for flight delays or cancellations.
The European Court of First Instance said the rules were a fair penalty that didn't discriminate against low-cost 
carriers, dismissing the airlines' claims that the rules infringe on international agreements and breach existing legal 
principles.
The new rules came into force in February. They oblige airlines to pay passengers up to 600 euros ($725) if they 
are bumped off a flight, double the previous limit. Similar compensation is required if the airline is held responsible 
for canceling a flight.
Delays of two to four hours require airlines to serve snacks or full meals, while delays over five hours entitle 
passengers to a refund and a hotel room if necessary. Refunds for round-trip flights must be offered if the journey is 
no longer necessary, for example if a business meeting is missed.
The court said air passengers whose flights are delayed suffer more than train or ferry travelers.
"Because, in particular, of the location of airports, which are generally outside urban centers, and of the particular 
procedures for checking-in and reclaiming baggage, the inconvenience suffered by passengers when such 
incidents occur is not comparable," it said.
It rejected a complaint by the European Low Fares Airline Association that the rules were unfair to budget carriers 
because compensation levels were often much higher than the cost of their tickets.
All flight delays are equally painful and all airlines should be treated the same, no matter how much they charge, the 
court said.
The International Air Transport Association _ which represents 270 carriers worldwide _ estimates that the 
regulation will cost the industry more than 600 million euros ($725 million) a year at a time when it is facing higher 
fuel costs and increased competition.
EU: Airlines Must Compensate Passengers
ELFAA _ whose members include Ryanair Holdings PLC, TUI AG's Hapag-Lloyd Express and Flybe _ said late or 
canceled flights are usually beyond the control of the airlines and the law gave passengers the expectation that they 
are entitled to "ridiculous amounts of compensation."
Airlines cannot be held responsible if delays or cancellations are caused by "extraordinary circumstances" beyond 
their control _ such as strikes or security threats.
Ryanair said most flight delays are caused by bad weather or Europe's "highly ineffective" air traffic control.
The European traffic control agency, Eurocontrol, said air navigation delayed air journeys by an average of 1.9 
minutes per flight last year.
It said Tuesday that 2005 was a record year for aviation in Europe with over 9.2 million flights and more than 700 
million passengers.
The number of flights grew by 4.5 percent last year and should grow by 3 percent in 2006. Some 2.5 million people 
will fly every day during summer 2006, it said. Traffic has grown by 15 percent since 1999.

European airlines will hear Tuesday if they have won a legal challenge to new EU rules guaranteeing passengers 
compensation for flight delays or cancellations.
The International Air Transport Association _ which represents 270 carriers worldwide _ estimates that the 
regulation will cost the industry more than euro600 million ($725US million) a year at a time when it is facing higher 
fuel charges and increased competition.
Last September, the court's legal adviser said the regulations were in line with EU law and recommended the 
European Court of Justice reject the appeal brought by IATA and the European Low Fares Airline Association. The 
court follows the advocate general's recommendations in about 80 percent of cases.
The airlines claim the rules infringe international agreements, breach legal principles and give unfair advantages to 
other forms of transport.
The new rules came into force in February. They force airlines to pay passengers up to euro600 ($725US) if they 
are bumped off a flight, double the previous limit. Similar compensation is on offer if the airline is held responsible 
for canceling a flight.
Delays of two to four hours will require airlines to serve snacks or full meals, while delays over five hours entitle 
passengers to a refund and a hotel room if necessary. Refunds of return flights must be offered if the journey is no 
longer necessary, for example if a business meeting is missed.
Low-cost airlines claim the law discriminates against them, saying the compensation is often much higher than the 
cost of their tickets and forces them to pay in cases that are beyond their control.
ELFAA _ whose members include Ryanair, Hapag-Lloyd Express and flybe _ said the rules have created huge 
confusion among consumers who do not understand the limits.
Airlines cannot be held responsible if cancellations or delays are caused by "extraordinary circumstances" beyond 
their control _ such as strikes or security threats.
EU Court to Rule on Airlines' Challenge
"Passengers have been submitting complaints to airlines requesting compensation several times the level of the 
fare they paid, even when the airline had taken all reasonable measures to avoid the delay or cancellation," it said.
In December, the European Commission launched legal action against Belgium, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg 
for failing to introduce penalties for airlines that broke the rules.
It also issued a formal warning to Slovakia that it could face similar legal action unless it provides more information 
on the setting of sanctions.
The EU high court could impose hefty fines if it judges national governments have failed to apply the laws.

British Airways challenged no-frill airlines on Tuesday by announcing a restructuring of its loss-making regional 
services and a sharp reduction in its budget airfares.
Offering one-way fares costing as little as 25 pounds ($44US.20, euro36.50), BA's regional operation CitiExpress 
will be renamed BA Connect, with prices slashed by more than 40 percent, the company said.
Business class will be scrapped from the regional operation and passengers will have to pay for meals. But the 
practice of restricted and non-changeable tickets also will be ended, with all tickets, no matter how little they cost, 
being changeable.
Tuesday's announcement effectively means that BA is once again running a no-frills operation, something it has not 
done since it launched low-fare airline Go in 1998. BA sold Go in 2001.
The restructuring means that free food and business class on domestic and short-haul routes operated by BA will 
remain only on flights from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports.
But business and frequent flyer passengers will be able to buy what the airline calls BA Connect Plus tickets in the 
new operation. These will include airport lounge access, and one-way prices will start from 110 pounds 
($194US.50, euro160.61).
BA CitiExpress currently operates from more than a dozen British airports, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, 
Scotland; and Manchester and Birmingham, England. Countries served include France, Germany, Italy, Spain and 
Switzerland.
Bookings for the new regional services can be made beginning Feb. 1, with BA Connect starting on March 26, the 
company said.
"The restructuring of the regional business will set us apart in this fiercely competitive market," said BA CitiExpress 
managing director David Evans, whose company competes with successful budget carriers such as Ryanair and 
EasyJet.
British Airways Announce New Budget Rates
"We have an innovative service promise for business and short-break leisure air travelers, offering year-round, one-
way prices that match the no-frills airlines and the added service promise and resources of an airline of British 
Airways' size and stature."
BA's regional services have been losing an estimated 30 million pounds ($53US million, euro44 million) a year.

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of EasyJet and the largest single shareholder in the low-cost airline, said yesterday he 
was studying the merits of Iceland's FL Group as a potential buyer.
His remarks came as the EasyJet share price rose in heavy trading by 28 1/2p, or 7.5 per cent, to close at 408 1/4p; 
its highest level since November 2002. It was the top performer in the FTSE 350 index.
EasyJet said at the weekend it had appointed Goldman Sachs as its main financial adviser to replace Credit Suisse 
First Boston; a decision seen as strengthening of its defences againsta possible hostile takeover bid.
FL Group, which includes Icelandair, the Icelandic flag carrier, made its first raid on EasyJet in late 2004. It has 
since accumulated a 16.2 per cent stake, placing it only slightly behind the 16.6 per cent held by Mr Haji-Ioannou's 
wholly owned EasyGroup. The Haji-Ioannou family has a total stake of slightly less than 41 per cent, with stakes of 
12.02 per cent held by Mr Haji-Ioannou's brother and sister.
The EasyJet founder said:"As (the brand owner), I care who will be the licensee of the EasyJet brand, but I have 
just not done enough work to decide if the FL Group would be okayor not."
In an e-mail response to the Bloomberg news agency,Mr Haji-Ioannou said thathe believed the EasyJet share price 
was still undervalued. "I am not any closer to selling to anyone; I still think the stock has more potential," he said.
The price has more than tripled in the last 15 months from the low point of 118 1/4p in September 2004 after two 
profits warnings earlier that year.
FL Group started buildingits stake in October 2004. Repeated purchases have fuelled speculation about a bid.

appointment seen as reinforcement against a hostile bid
The Icelandic group recently acquired Denmark's Sterling Airways, the fourth largest low-cost airline in Europe 
behind Ryanair, EasyJet and Air Berlin. The group made clear it expects further sector consolidation.
It raised Dollars 730m (Pounds 412m) in a share issue late last year inorder to bolster its finances in advance of 
further prospective takeovers.
The European low-costairline sector remains highly fragmented after the start upof more than 60 carriers in recent 
years, many of them in response to the success of the clearmarket leaders Ryanair and EasyJet.
Both Ryanair and EasyJetare expected to overtake traditional network carriers in passenger numbers to becomethe 
largest short-haul airlinesin Europe before the end ofthe decade.

Norwich Airport, majority-privatised by its local council owners nearly two years ago, has joined the group of fast-
growing UK regional airports that are taking advantage of the rapid expansion of low-fare airlines to add new 
destinations.
Its dominant neighbour to the south - London Stansted, owned by BAA - has based its development on the success 
of leading European low-cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet. But Norwich owes its recent emergence as a regional 
player to the arrival last year of Flybe.
Flybe has been transformed in the past three years into a low-cost airline based in the UK regions and flying chiefly 
on domestic routes, which account for about 80 per cent of its turnover, but also from the UK regions to France and 
Spain. It added Norwich to its UK bases in February last year. It is considering the possible development of a 
further base from 2007 at Southend airport, Essex.
Richard Jenner, Norwich airport managing director, says passenger numbers from April to December had already 
exceeded the 450,000 passengers achieved in the year to March 2005. It is forecasting 600,000 in the current year 
to the end of March, rising to 870,000 next year and 1m in 2007-08.
Mr Jenner says the airport has a catchment area of about 1.2m people and has the advantage that the region has 
relatively difficult road and rail connections to many parts of the UK.
Flybe started with daily flights to Belfast City last February and quickly added services to Edinburgh, Glasgow and 
Jersey. Since October it has added a mix of ski, winter sun and city routes including Chambery, Geneva, Alicante 
and Malaga.
In March it is planning to add twice-daily flights to Aberdeen, daily flights to Dublin and three flights a week each to 
Faro, Guernsey and Murcia as well as adding Exeter and Bordeaux.
REGIONAL FOCUS: Flybe helps Norwich Airport expand Recently privatised, it is increasing its operations 
without relying on Ryanair and EasyJet , writes Kevin Do....
The airport expects Flybe to expand from these 15 destinations to more than 20. The airline could double Norwich's 
passenger volumes by summer 2006.
Flybe, which is planning a stock market flotation late this year or in 2007, has developed a market niche designed to 
avoid head-to-head competition with Ryanair and EasyJet.
As part of its strategy to create a "backbone of Britain" network Flybe is developing a number of bases at smaller 
regional airports around the UK.
Norwich airport's development has been spurred by its privatisation in March 2004. Omniport, an aspiring European 
regional airport group, bought an 80.1 per cent stake for Pounds 11m - including Pounds 1m deferred for 12 years - 
with a commitment to spend Pounds 8.3m over the first five years to expand capacity. The remaining 19.9 per cent 
stake is still held by Norfolk County and Norwich City councils.
Omniport has launched a Pounds 4m development scheme to take passenger capacity to 1.2m-1.5m, which should 
be completed by October.
The group is backed by the Glasgow-based Penta Capital private equity fund and Caledonia Investments, a 
London-listed investment trust, each with about a third of the equity. It was formed in 2000 by Clive Davies and 
John Baillie, who had previously been responsible for airport development at National Express and Stagecoach.
The group has also bought 100 per cent control of Maastricht Aachen airport in the Netherlands near the German 
and Belgian borders, and is a potential bidder for Exeter airport, where a new tender is expected shortly.
"We have some targets," says Mr Davies. "Exeter has good growth potential. It would be a good fit for us with a 
similar catchment area and characteristics to Norwich."

Easyjet aircraft werent as full over the Christmas period as they were in 2004, but passenger numbers were still in 
line with the company's expectations with revenue for the year showing a leap of more than 20% at the budget 
airline.
The load factor fell three percentage points to 80.5% against 80.8% in December 2004 with nearly 2.4 million 
passengers using the low cost airline compared to 2.1 million a year earlier, an increase of 11.1%.
But the load factor is still higher over the year, by three percentage points to 84.9% against 84.6% for the 12 
months to December 2004. More than 30.3 million passengers chose to fly with Easyjet (EZJ) up from 25.7 million 
the year before.
Revenue in the year to December 2005 was £1.38 billion against £1.15 billion in the 12 months to December 2004. 
The shares added 15.875p to 395.625p with nearly two million shares going through the ticker in the first two hours 
trading.
Some shareholders think the Icelandic FL Group is keen to raise its 16.2% stake and possibly launch a hostile bid, 
a matter that Goldman Sachs is advising Easyjet on.
This is unlikely unless it get the approval of Easyjets founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who, with his family, still controls 
more than 40% of the company.
Broker UBS believes that the FL stake is a financial investment and has posted a neutral recommendation on the 
shares and a price target of 380p.
UBS says the slightly lower monthly load factor was a satisfactory level for this time of the year which is traditionally 
weaker for the low-cost carriers.
Credit Suisse First Boston is also neutral on the shares, saying passenger numbers were in line with recent trends 
and says the fact that 'unit revenue is running ahead of last years is encouraging.
Last month, Easyjet exercised its right to acquire 20 further Airbus A319 aircraft for delivery during 2008 and 2009. 
The results will be announced in 20 January.
Citywire Verdict:
Revenues flying high at Easyjet amid Icelandic bid rumours
Airlines are unlikely places for fortunes to be made. The old adage that says the best way to make a million is to 
start with ten still applies. But the no -frills airlines have proved they can live with high fuel costs and, contrary to 
many forecasts, are here to stay as long as people have the money to travel. There are worse places to put your 
money, but bid prospect or not we still prefer Ryanair.

Body
The government is now working toward selling a majority stake in Aer Lingus through a stock market flotation by 
June.
Its intention to proceed with such an accelerated sales process has been confirmed by official sources over the 
weekend.
The sources said that the urgency is linked to the intention by Ryanair to step up competition with the state owned 
airline by launching 18 new routes out of Dublin in the Spring.
 Aer Lingus has said it needs up to 2bn euro in new finance to expand its fleet. The sources made clear as well that 
the government is working urgently to resolve a 336m euro pension fund deficit at Aer Lingus, which is seen as an 
important barrier to the flotation. The hurdle might be overcome by issuing new shares in the company before a 
flotation . Such shares might be placed in a trust and used to partially offset the pension liability. Other ways of 
solving the pension problem were also being looked at, the sources said.

Major European markets touched new highs Friday after an advance in the technology sector and on jobless data 
from the U.S. that didn't stoke inflationary concerns.
Germany's DAX 30 index rose 0.4 percent at 5,536, France's CAC 40 index added 0.7 percent at 4,867 and the 
U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gained 0.7 percent at 5,731.
European equity markets have generally had a good start in 2006, with both the U.K. and the German market 
repeatedly hitting new highs this week.
"The year should be a good one (for the European equity market) but the rise should be more subdued than we had 
in the last two or three (years)," said Alain Bokobza, head of pan-European equity strategy at Societe Generale.
"Within the equity markets, we like insurance and the pharmaceutical sector. We are cautious on the oil sector," he 
said.
Europe got a lift from a higher open for U.S. stock markets after the number of jobs created in December fell short 
of expectations, strengthening hopes the Federal Reserve can end its policy of raising interest rates sooner rather 
than later.
European software companies, including France's Atos Origin and Cap Gemini, and microchip makers, such as 
Infineon Technologies, picked up on the higher Nasdaq trend from Thursday's U.S. session to gain sharply through 
the day.
"We believe the (IT) sector is poised to continue outperforming the market as it should benefit from more positive 
newsflow regarding orders for next-generation networks," said equity strategists at Standard & Poor's.
German consumer-electronics group Medion tumbled 14 percent after the company warned fiscal 2005 earnings 
before interest and taxes will be "significantly lower" than analysts' forecasts. Medion cited its plan to discontinue 
unprofitable product lines and order structures and a difficult consumer and market environment.
European Stock Markets Finish Higher
Dutch media group VNU rose 2.6 percent in Amsterdam after it said it will allow potential private-equity bidders 
limited access to its books to perform due diligence, according to a Financial Times report.
Bouygues shares climbed as much as 8 percent in Paris, following a report in the Les Echos newspaper that 
Spain's Telefonica and other companies are interested in its French mobile telecoms division.
Deutsche Bank downgraded low-cost airlines Ryanair PLC and easyJet PLC to sell from hold on slowing growth 
trends. Deutsche Bank upgraded Air France-KLM to hold from sell, saying it sees the company's market share 
gains continuing in 2006.
All three airlines rose by less than 1 percent.
Credit Suisse First Boston altered its view on several European stock exchanges, upgrading London Stock 
Exchange to outperform but downgrading Deutsche Boerse and Euronext to underperform. Deutsche Boerse rose 
0.6 percent, Euronext eased 2.9 percent, while the LSE added 1.1 percent.

Tui UK has sold Coventry airport as part of its latest move to rationalise its Thomson travel business and to confront 
the challenge of the rapidly expanding low-cost airlines to its traditional package holiday operations.
Tui UK, the British subsidiary of the German Tui travel group, said it had sold Coventry airport, its first UK base for 
scheduled low-cost airline operations, to Cafco-C, an Irish/US joint venture, whose shareholders have chiefly 
property and airport management interests.
No financial details were disclosed.
Tui acquired the airport in 2004, when its previous owner ran into planning problems for the development of a new 
passenger terminal.
The airport had previously been used chiefly for cargo operations but passenger numbers have risen rapidly since 
the start of the Thomsonfly low-cost carrier operations from 8,000 in 2003 to 800,000 last year. A planning inquiry 
into the airport expansion is due to open next week.
Peter Rothwell, managing director of Tui UK, said that the German group was repositioning its UK Thomson travel 
business, the leading UK tour operator,to offer seat-only sales from most of its 26 UK airports. The move is 
designed to complement its package holiday offerings and to enable it to take back some market share from the 
low-cost airlines led by Ryanair and EasyJet, which have increasingly undermined the operations of the traditional 
charter carriers.
Tui has been heavily restructuring and rationalising its UK operations and has consolidated its branding round the 
Thomson name.
The old Britannia Airways name for the charter airline has been replaced by Thomsonfly and it has dropped the 
former Lunn Poly name from its chain of travel agents. It is cutting travel agency commissions and is seeking to 
take more of its bookings via the internet, where it has consolidated all of its seat inventory on one website.
Tui UK moves to halt low-cost airlines' threat TRAVEL & LEISURE
The Tui UK headquarters has also been moved from central London to Luton airport and the overall workforce has 
been cut from 13,000 to 11,000 during the past year.

EasyJet, the UK low-cost airline, is entering the Italian domestic market for the first time as part of the expansion of 
operations at its new base at Milan Malpensa airport.
It announced yesterday four more routes from Milan, including three domestic services to Palermo, Naples and 
Olbia (Sardinia) as part of a total package of 14 new routes that will also expand its operations from its base at 
Liverpool and add three routes to Lisbon.
The aggressive move into the Italian market will pose a growing competitive threat to Alitalia, the hitherto heavily 
lossmaking minority state-owned Italian carrier, as well as to the local Italian low-cost carriers Myair and Volare.
EasyJet is following the lead set by Ireland's Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, which has already 
moved heavily into the Italian market with three bases established at Milan-Bergamo, Rome-Ciampino and Pisa 
airports, including a small network of domestic Italian routes.
EasyJet is also adding four destinations from Liverpool to Faro, Krakow, Mahon (Menorca) and Marseille and three 
routes to Lisbon from London Luton, Milan and Paris Charles de Gaulle airports. It said it was aiming to increase its 
passenger volumes from more than 30m in 2005 to about 35m this year.
It is taking delivery of nine more Airbus A319s in the spring that will take its total fleet to 116 by the summer.
Initially, it is basing three Airbus A319s at Malpensa, with the first two starting at the end of March and the third in 
the summer.
The airline is rapidly expanding its fleet of Airbus aircraft and by the autumn will have consolidated the use of its 
remaining 32 Boeing 737-700s to its bases at Luton, Newcastle and Belfast International airports. It plans to convert 
its bases at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool to solely Airbus operations in the summer.
Ryanair, after announcing several new bases last year including Pisa, Nottingham East Midlands and Cork, is 
concentrating the latest phase of its expansion at Dublin, where it is adding five aircraft and is launching 18 more 
routes from April.

The index ended at 7,469.54, still 121.96 points ahead on its level of a week ago.
The dip reflected similar adjustments on markets abroad, which hyave also been rising strongly.
 Cavan-based building materials group Kingspan was down 24 to 1091, despite saying earlier today that operating 
profit and earnings growth for 2005 will be in line with current market expectations. However, it did admit that its 
important UK market is weak. Ryanair was down 4 to 803, despite announcing a 29pc rise in passenger numbers

Santiago de Compostela, in the rainy north-west corner of Spain, is running out of its excellent shellfish and 
Albarino wines. Tobacconists are doing a roaring trade in Girona, a medieval city in Catalonia. Property developers 
are planning a "retirement town" for 10,000 Germans on the outskirts of Malaga. And in L'Aude, a depressed region 
in southern France, Britons are repopulating abandoned villages and fuelling a local property price boom in the 
process.
What these apparently disconnected events have in common is the arrival of scheduled flights at Europe's small 
regional airports.
Low-cost routes are redrawing Europe's economic map, encouraging tourism to long ignored areasand influencing 
where Europeans choose to live and work. Some economists say low-cost airlines have become the main catalyst 
for revival of Europe's "forgotten" regional economies.
Before Ryanair began flying to Santiago last year, most foreigners who made the trek to Spain's foremost 
pilgrimage site did so on foot. New scheduled services from London, Rome and Frankfurt have transformed the 
local economy, says Antonio Lopez de Avila of the Instituto de Empresa business school in Madrid. Hotels and 
restaurants that closed for winter are now open the year round. "Tourists are so voracious that Santiago is running 
out of local wines and shellfish," he says.
Before Ryanair chose Girona, an 80-minute train ride to Barcelona, as its Mediterranean hub, the tiny airport 
opened for only a couple of hours a day. It now handles 3m passengers a year from 21 destinations in seven 
countries. The local economy is booming.
"You can measure the impact of low-cost airlines in all sorts of ways, from the growth of car rental companies to the 
explosion in the number of municipal permits for tobacconist shops," Mr Lopez de Avila says. "Tourists arrive with

forgotten regions, reports Leslie Crawford
empty suitcases and fill them with cheap Spanish cigarettes. The money they make from selling the tobacco in their 
home countries pays for their holiday in Girona."
Ryanair began flying to Carcassonne in 1998. In July this year the airport handled 90,000 visitors, up from a mere 
4,000 monthly visits six years ago. Carcassonne's chamber of commerce estimates the increased activity at the 
airport has generated 3,049 jobs in L'Aude, a region of 310,000 inhabitants, and created Euros 374m (Pounds 
256m) in extra economic activity.
"An aeroplane-full of British visitors may not sound very significant but many of them liked what they found here, 
especially the property, and even more the property prices," says a British resident in Carcassonne.
"This summer the one flight a day from the UK became two flights a day, says a British resident in Carcassonne.
"Services started to Belgium. The foreigners have bought up most of the old farms and stone village houses. Prices 
are well on their way to Provence. Our village has been repopulated by young people. Some have found 
specialised building work, such as stonemasons. Others benefit from the revolution in electronic communications - 
web-designers, translators, writers, even a recruitment agent."
Last year 200,000 Londoners left in search for a better life. About 30,000 of them settled in France. A further 
750,000 Britons own property in Spain, according to the British embassy in Madrid. British law firms, estate agents 
and insurance companies are setting up offices on Spain's Mediterranean coast to advise Britons on how to set up 
businesses, buy property and navigate the tax and legal systems. Mr Lopez de Avila says this amounts to a 
"cultural revolution".
Air Berlin and Hapag Lloyd are ferrying increasing numbers of Germans to Spain. So much so that property 
developers have begun marketing "retirement towns" tailored to German pensioners. One project, in Malaga, aims 
to replicate a German town in the sun for 10,000 residents.
Finance ministry officials in Madrid believe that low-cost flights have became an important factor in sustaining the 
construction boom in Spain. Although the Bank of Spain says the number of housing starts is down this year from a 
record 700,000 in 2004, Spain is still building more houses than France and Germany combined.
Low-cost airlines do not carry only tourists. Bluair, a Romanian airline, has launÃ‚Â­ched regular services from 
Bucharest to Reus, a former military airport south of Barcelona, to bring farmhands to work in the vineyards and 
orchards of Catalonia.
"The airport has become one of the main drivers of our local economy," says Juan Josep Tarda of the chamber of 
commerce in Reus. "If the railways drove economic development in the 19th century, and highways led the way in 
the 20th, then this century belongs to airports," he says.

Bratislava airport set for sale to Vienna rival SLOVAKIA

The Slovak government is poised to sell 66 per cent of Bratislava airport to Vienna airport for a reported Sk6bn 
(Dollars 188m) despite fears that it will try to stifle its rival's rapid growth.
The privatisation committee yesterday recommended the bid of Flughafen Wien, Penta Group, a Slovak private 
investment group, and Raiffeisen Bank of Austria for Bratislava airport and that of Kosice, the country's second city. 
According to local media Vienna bid Sk6bn for Bratislava and Sk900m for Kosice and pledged to invest Sk7.9bn 
into Bratislava.
Abertis, the Spanish infrastructure group, together with TBI, its British airport operator, came second with a bid of 
Sk3.3bn. The cabinet should make a final decision at its first meeting in mid-January.
Bratislava is the fastest growing airport in Europe with 1.3m passengers expected this year, two thirds of whom are 
flying on low-cost airlines.
Vienna, paired with the politically well-connected Penta Group, has long been favourite to buy Bratislava because it 
would achieve the biggest synergies.
Vienna's Schwechat airport, which is just 50km from its acquisition target, is close to full capacity with 15m 
passengers expected this year. By acquiring Bratislava it would gain extra capacity that would allow it to postpone 
the construction of a third runway.
In Vienna's business plan the two airports would be linked by a fast train and would share business, expected to 
reach 30m passengers by 2015, with Bratislava specialising in low-cost and charter operators.
However, some officials fear that Vienna will hold Bratislava back. "We are competition to Vienna and if another 
bidder wins this competition will increase," says Jan Kotula, deputy transport minister. "There are high landing 
payments for planes at Vienna and we fear they will bring that policy here."
Bratislava airport set for sale to Vienna rival SLOVAKIA
The competition office has expressed concern and it might now launch an inquiry. Rival bidder Cologne-Bonn 
airport has also threatened to appeal to the European Commission.
Low-cost airlines are particularly unhappy with Vienna's bid. Ryanair, which plans to have a 25 per cent market 
share in Bratislava next year, has written to the government warning that it might stop using the airport.
"The only reason why Vienna airport is interested in taking control over Bratislava is to limit this low-cost 
competition and be able to maintain prohibitively high prices for airport services in this part of Europe," Ryanair 
wrote.

Budget airline easyJet PLC said Thursday it will spend 505 million pounds (euro743 million; $890US million) to beef 
up its fleet with 20 new Airbus A319 planes.
The planes would be delivered during 2008 and 2009, said the London-based carrier, which has largely shrugged 
off the negative effects of surging oil prices to continue its strong growth in the past year.
The new planes are part of an option agreement from a previous deal to buy 120 aircraft from Airbus in 2003. Under 
the terms of the agreement, easyJet had the right to buy up to 120 more jets at the same basic price, subject to 
inflation.
EasyJet has joined other European budget carriers such as Ireland's Ryanair Holdings PLC in maintaining its 
growth despite record high oil prices.
The low-cost airlines have gained some ground by refusing to join the full-service airlines such as British Airways 
PLC in imposing fuel surcharges on customers. That has increased the price differential between the two groups.
EasyJet announced last month that passenger numbers had risen 21 percent to 29.6 million over the year, helping 
to deliver a 3.7 percent rise in net profits.
EasyJet shares lifted 0.3 percent 374.25 pence ($6US.52; euro5.43).
Earlier this week, Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it was cutting its flying schedule in the next quarter 
because of the late delivery of planes from Boeing Co.
The flight cancellations would result in 100,000 fewer passengers a month from January to March, said Ryanair, 
which has been opening up routes across Europe rapidly in the past year.
Ryanair shares were barely changed Thursday, up just 0.06 percent at euro8.13 ($9US.65).

Aer Lingus has announced five new routes to the continent and one to Britain for 2006.
Three of the new routes will be from Cork and the other three from Dublin.
The unveiling of the extra services come in the wake of yesterday's announcement by Ryanair that it is starting 18 
new routes out of Dublin.
 From next June, the state owned airline will launch routes from Cork thrice weekly to Berlin, thrice weekly to 
Birmingham and weekly to Tenerife. It says it will also add additional frequencies to existing routes from Cork to 
Nice, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Alicante, Malaga and Rome. It says the increase in its services will mean an extra 
300,000 seats into and out of Cork on an annual basis. It is to base a fourth A320 aircraft in the southern city. From 
Dublin, Aer Lingus will fly from March to Poznan, bringing the number of its Polish destinations to three. Also from 
March it will recommence services from Dublin to Majorca (3 weekly) and Rennes (2 weekly).

Dateline: DUBLIN, Ireland 
Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's fastest-growing budget airline, announced Wednesday it will launch 18 new routes 
from Dublin and employ another 250 people in one of its biggest expansions on its Irish home turf.
In a direct challenge to state-owned airline Aer Lingus, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary _ who made his 
announcement in a Santa Claus outfit, complete with fake white beard _ said he planned to base five extra Boeing 
737-800s at Dublin International Airport as of April.
Ryanair plans to begin direct services that month between Dublin and Salzburg, Austria; La Rochelle, Marseille and 
Nantes in France; Hamburg and Stuttgart in Germany; Milan and Venice in Italy; Kaunas, Lithuania; Krakow, 
Poznan and Wroclaw in Poland; Porto, Portugal; Bratislava; Slovakia; Valencia, Spain; Goteborg and Malmo in 
Sweden.
Investors applauded the aggressive move, pushing Ryanair's shares 2.4 percent higher to euro8.09 (US$9.55) on 
the Irish Stock Exchange.
For years, Ryanair passengers trying to reach most of the airline's continental European destinations have had to 
fly via a London airport _ where, because Ryanair doesn't check baggage through to connecting flights, they must 
spend hours collecting their bags and re-checking.
In some cases, Ryanair's new routes will compete directly with Aer Lingus, which since 2001 has rapidly slimmed 
down and expanded its range of direct services to European cities.
In others, Ryanair is seeking to capitalize on Ireland's growing immigrant-worker population from Eastern Europe, 
chiefly more than 150,000 workers from Poland and the Baltic states in this country of 4 million.
O'Leary said Ryanair in April also will increase the frequency of its existing direct Dublin services to and from 
Biarritz and Carcassonne, France; Frankfurt, Germany; Lodz, Poland; Faro, Portugal; Barcelona and Malaga, 
Spain; and Cardiff, Wales.
Ryanair to Launch 18 New Dublin Routes
He forecast that the greatly increased Ryanair traffic in and out of Dublin would produce an extra 1.5 million 
passengers annually, "over 1 million of which will be inbound visitors for Irish tourism."
O'Leary, who regularly courts press attention with in-your-face ad campaigns and wild photo opportunities, donned 
a Santa suit and posed by a stack of presents, each marked with a new Ryanair destination from Dublin.
O'Leary also formally dropped Ryanair's threat to obstruct an Irish government plan to expand the already crowded 
Dublin airport _ and presented what he called "a humble pie" to a Dublin Airport Authority representative, Vincent 
Wall, in the press conference audience.
In May, after years of delay, the government announced that the Dublin Airport Authority would be put in charge of 
developing a euro1.8 billion (US2.1 billion) second terminal by 2009.
O'Leary had called for the state-owned body to be excluded, alleging it was incompetent and wasteful, and the 
project handed to a private investor who would operate the second terminal in competition with the existing state-
owned terminal.
But on Wednesday, still in his Santa suit, O'Leary said Ryanair "won't be opposing the master plan, either in the 
planning stage or the courts."

from Dublin and employ another 250 people in one of its biggest expansions on its Irish home turf.
In a direct challenge to state-owned airline Aer Lingus, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he planned to 
base five extra Boeing 727-800s at Dublin International Airport as of April.
Ryanair plans to begin direct services that month between Dublin and Salzburg, Austria; La Rochelle, Marseille and 
Nantes in France; Hamburg and Stuttgart in Germany; Milan and Venice in Italy; Kaunas, Lithuania; Krakow, 
Poznan and Wroclaw in Poland; Porto, Portugal; Bratislava; Slovakia; Valencia, Spain; Goteborg and Malmo in 
Sweden.
Investors applauded the aggressive move, pushing Ryanair's shares 2.5 percent higher euro8.10 (US$9.60) on the 
Irish Stock Exchange.
Until now, Ryanair passengers trying to reach most of the airline's continental European destinations had to fly via a 
London airport _ where, because Ryanair doesn't check baggage through to connecting flights, they usually spent 
hours collecting their bags and re-checking.
In some cases, Ryanair's new routes will compete directly with Aer Lingus, which since 2001 has rapidly slimmed 
down and greatly expanded its range of direct services to European cities.
In others, Ryanair is seeking to capitalize on Ireland's growing immigrant-worker population from Eastern Europe, 
chiefly more than 150,000 workers from Poland and the Baltic states in this country of 4 million.
O'Leary said Ryanair in April also will increase the frequency of its existing direct Dublin services to and from 
Biarritz and Carcassonne, France; Frankfurt, Germany; Lodz, Poland; Faro, Portugal; Barcelona and Malaga, 
Spain; and Cardiff, Wales.
He forecast that the greatly increased Ryanair traffic in and out of Dublin would produce an extra 1.5 million 
passengers annually, "over 1 million of which will be inbound visitors for Irish tourism."

CAA rejects 'cross-subsidy' plan for Pounds 2.7bn Stansted  airport expansion
 CAA rejects 'cross-subsidy' plan for Pounds 2.7bn Stansted  airport 
expansion

The Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for BAA's three London airports, has rejected attempts by the 
group to use charges at Heathrow and Gatwickto "cross-subsidise" the ambitious planned expansion of Stansted 
airport.
The CAA said it planned to continue with its existing regulatory regime of "stand-alone" pricing whereby the three 
airports must individually justify and fund future capital investments.
Mike Clasper, BAA chief executive, warned last May that the earliest possible development of Stansted with the 
building of a second runway and passenger terminal for operation by the end of 2013 could be achieved only if the 
project were cross-subsidised by increases in airline user charges at Heathrow and Gatwick.
Otherwise, the Pounds 2.7bn Stansted project aimed at tripling capacity from 25m passengers a year at present to 
76m by 2030, would have to be delayed for "several years", he said.
The call for cross-subsidisation was fiercely opposed by airlines using Heathrow and Gatwick led by British Airways, 
Virgin Atlantic and BMI British Midland.
The CAA yesterday published its first consultation paper on the setting of price controls for the three London 
airports for the five years from 2008 to 2013, in effect firing the starting gun for a two-year regulatory battle over 
London airport price controls.
It said that on the basis of "evidence currently available" there was no reason to abandon stand-alone regulation.
This approach was crucial to ensuring a level playing field for non-BAA airports competing in the south-east, most 
importantly London Luton airport, and also to making BAA more responsive to the needs of its airline customers at 
the individual airports.
CAA rejects 'cross-subsidy' plan for Pounds 2.7bn Stansted  airport expansion
Harry Bush, CAA group director for economic regulation, said that more extreme moves such as a break-up of the 
BAA London airports monopoly, which has been rejected by the government, could not be considered as part of the 
price review.
The CAA held out the prospect of other inducements to give BAA incentives to continue investing in further billion 
pound projects to expand airport capacity in the congested south-east of England, including the experimental 
setting of higher charges at Stansted in the period from 2008 to test market acceptance for investment in more 
capacity.
The expansion of Stansted was identified as the most immediate priority forcreating more airportcapacity in the 
south-east in the government's aviation white paper at the end of 2003.
BAA said two weeks ago that it was aiming to submit a planning application for the so-called Stansted Generation 2 
project in 2007.
However, it would proceed with the first phase of the construction only if it had "the regulator's acceptance and 
support for the investment, and we are confident that the project can be remunerated".
Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low cost airlines, have already been critical of the cost of BAA's plans 
for expanding Stansted.
David O'Brien, the chairman of the Stansted Airlines Consultative Committee and Ryanair operations director, said 
that the BAA project was a "gold plated folly with no supporting business plan" and was "testament to the failure of 
the current regulatory regime to restrain this out of control monopoly".
The CAA admitted yesterday that the conflict between BAA and theairlines at Stansted had blocked the CAA's 
effortsto secure a "constructive engagement" between the two sides in the run-up to the regulatory review.

Body
Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, today said it plans to make Dublin a major European base and open a total of 18 
routes from the capital to European cities.
Ryanair, which is now Ireland's largest airline and has, until today, largely confined its operations at Dublin Airport 
to UK routes.
However, from April 2006 the airline will base five new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in Dublin.
 These new aircraft will allow Ryanair to open up 18 new routes from Dublin to Continental Europe and frequencies 
will increase on eight existing Dublin-Europe routes. This additional capacity will allow Ryanair's traffic at Dublin to 
grow from 5.5m to 7m passengers annually as Ryanair moves next year from 35m to over 40m passengers per 
annum. The new routes will include: Dublin to Baden (Stuttgart) and Hamburg in Germany, Krakow, Poznan and 
Wroclaw in Poland, Milan and Venice and Valencia in Spain among others.

Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday it is cutting its flying schedule in the next quarter because of 
the late delivery of planes from Boeing Co.
The flight cancellations would result in 100,000 fewer passengers a month from January to March, said Ryanair, 
which has been opening up routes across Europe rapidly in the past year.
It will not affect Ryanair's profit guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Ryanair's Deputy Chief 
Executive Michael Cawley said. The airline, Europe's largest budget carrier by passenger numbers, said last month 
it expected full-year profit to rise about 10 percent to just over 300 million euros ($354.4 million).
Ryanair is waiting on a delivery of four Boeing 737-800 series aircraft, which have been delayed by a strike by 
Boeing's Machinists in September.
Boeing was forced to halt production of commercial airplanes for four weeks after workers walked off the job over 
issues including health benefits and pension payouts.
The Chicago-based aerospace company said in a statement that it has worked with Ryanair on a revised delivery 
schedule through 2006.
Passengers affected by the changes will be notified at least three weeks in advance and switched to other flights or 
given a refund of their airfare, the airline said.

Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday that it is cutting its new year flying schedule because of the 
late delivery of planes from Boeing Co.
The flight cancellations would result in 100,000 fewer passengers a month between January and March, said 
Ryanair, which has been opening up routes across Europe rapidly in the past year.
It will not affect Ryanair's profit guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, Ryanair's Deputy Chief 
Executive Michael Cawley said.
The airline, Europe's largest budget carrier by passenger numbers, said last month it expected full-year profit to rise 
about 10 percent to just over euro300 million (US$354.4 million).
Ryanair is waiting on a delivery of four Boeing 737-800 series aircraft, which have been delayed by a strike by 
Boeing's machinists in September.
Ryanair has already covered some of the waiting period by extending the flying program on a number of older 737-
200 series aircraft due for retirement in December.
However, those planes have been sold and the pilots have been retrained on the 737-800s.
The airline said the delay will result in the cancellation of 200 rotations per month, around 1 percent of the total 
flying program, in the first three months of the year.
It will also delay the launch of the second aircraft at its Nottingham East Midlands base by a month and the launch 
of the second aircraft at its Pisa base by four months.
Passengers affected by the changes will be notified at least three weeks in advance and switched to other flights or 
given a refund of their airfare, the airline said.
It said that flights will return to normal when the last of the four planes is delivered in April.

Pilots' groups are calling for airlines to adhere to the social protection laws applicable at their main bases, to 
prevent them from exploiting different labour laws or establishing "shell" operating companies in lower-cost 
countries.
The European Cockpit Association (ECA) has submitted its views on the European Commission's next wave of air 
transport regulation rules - the revision of the 1992 Third Package of liberalisation - and says it wants to see 
harmonised social standards across the European Union.
The call follows a ruling in April when a Belgian court upheld three Ryanair cabin crew members' claim that their 
dismissal was illegal under Belgian law, even though their contracts were drawn up under Irish law, as their habitual 
workplace was Charleroi Brussels South airport.
The ECA fears that as airlines expand and merge across national boundaries, as foreseen under Third Package 
revisions, they could shift staff around to take advantage of less onerous regulatory regimes. It also fears safety 
oversight is being compromised by aircraft habitually being based outside their airline's country of registration.
The association, which represents national pilots' associations, wants to see the EC define any aircraft base as a 
principal centre of operation for mobile staff. "We would like to include into the Third Package reform clear rules 
saying what social rules apply based on principal place of business," says Ignacio Plaza, ECA legal and industrial 
affairs representative. The association put forward the clause in recent open skies talks between the USA and the 
EU, but it was rejected as being a purely European economic issue, says Plaza.
ECA secretary general Philip von Schöppenthau says: "We are at the beginning of a big change in aviation - with 
transnational mergers - and the regulation currently favours the economic side of liberalisation, not the social side, 
so Europe needs to catch up."
The Third Package is set to be reviewed next year and the ECA is one of many stakeholders to have submitted 
ideas, says the EC.

Body
Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, today said the late delivery of new aircraft from Boeing has meant delays to its 
expansion programme, a reduction in passenger traffic and changes to some of its schedules.
In a statement to the Irish Stock Exchange, Ryanair announced a number of changes to its flying programme during 
January, February and March 2006 to accommodate the late delivery of new aircraft from Boeing and Ryanair's 
decision to retire the existing fleet of 737-200's on schedule at the end of December.
These cancellations will reduce Ryanair's passenger traffic by around 100,000 passengers per month during 
January, February and March and will reduce the overall passenger traffic in the current fiscal year to just under 35 
million passengers.
 As a result of a strike in Boeing during September and October, all of Ryanair's aircraft deliveries this winter are 
being delivered a month late.

Body
## Ryanair has confirmed that it has held talks with a number of other EU aviation authorities in relation to 
transferring its aviation licence certificate. But the low-cost airline said such a move was being considered "solely 
with a view to lowering the high aircraft licensing costs here in Ireland" and would have no effect on its Irish 
workforce.
"Any such initiative, if implemented, would have no impact whatsoever on either our aircraft or our highly paid 
employees who are based here in Ireland," Ryanair said. The airline is also reported to be considering charging 
passengers for checking in luggage. If its new web-based check-in system, which is due to be launched on three 
routes in the New Year, proves successful, it is expected to look at charging travellers with luggage that needs to be 
put in the hold. => Irish Times

People choosing low-cost flights are going to have to learn to travel light.
It is still early days but the budget carriers are becoming increasingly eager to deter passengers from checking in 
baggage. As part of a concerted effort to cut handling costs, the airlines want them to travel only with a carry-on 
bag.
Some of the no-frills airlines are planning to offer passengers incentives to check in for their journeys online at 
home or in the office by printing off a bar-coded boarding pass and going straight to security and the departure 
gate.
Airlines such as Ryanair and Flybe believe they can reduce passenger handling operations at the airport, and as a 
result cut the number of check-in desks they need to rent and reduce check-in as well as baggage staff.
Flybe, the UK regional low-fare carrier, yesterday launched its latest cost-cutting measures as a "fair deal on 
baggage" for its passengers.
In future, Flybe passengers checking in at the airport will be charged Pounds 4 an item of checked-in baggage, or 
Pounds 2 an item if they register the number of check-in bags they will be travelling with, at the same that they book 
the flight online.
Jim French, Flybe chairman and chief executive, said the system, to be introduced from early February, was fair 
because at present 45 per cent of the airline's passengers travelled with only a carry-on bag. Under the current 
system, however, they pay through their fares for the baggage handling costs of all the other passengers.
As a quid pro quo for the new baggage charge, Flybe is rewarding passengers by cutting Pounds 1 off its fares. It is 
doubling the weight allowance for carry-on bags to 10kg and is increasing the checked-in luggage allowance to 
25kg to remove most excess baggage charges.
Flybe maintains that the new baggage charges are part of its "fair and transparent pricing strategy" where-by 
passengers choose independently what they want to pay for.

Paying for checked-in baggage is only another step on from paid-for inflight food and drinks, and in Flybe's case 
paying for seat selection, namely Pounds 5 for a "normal seat" and Pounds 15 for one with extra leg room.
It will be launching internet check-in, a system al-ready introduced by British Airways, from spring next year.
Flybe said its passengers had an average stay away of only three days, so 10kg of carry-on baggage was hardly a 
problem. It would allow "two pairs of jeans, two jumpers, one pair of trainers, four T-shirts, underwear (unspecified), 
a make-up bag, a toiletries bag, a belt and hair straighteners."

Flybe, the UK regional low-fares airline, has appointed Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein as financial adviser to lead 
a possible initial public offering late next year or in 2007.
Jim French, chairman and chief executive, said Flybe also planned to appoint three or four independent non-
executive directors by the spring in a bid to reform its corporate governance. The search for non-execs is being 
carried out by Odgers Ray & Berndtson.
An initial public offering within 12 to 18 months could value the airline at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m, 
according to analysts' initial estimates.
Interest is also being shown in the airline by private equity and venture capital groups, but Mr French said that an 
IPO was the preferred exit route for its trustee shareholders rather than a private placement or a trade sale.
Flybe is 81 per cent owned by Jersey-incorporated Rosedale (JW) Investments, one of the family trusts established 
to oversee the estate of the late Jack Walker, the former steel stockholding millionaire and owner of Blackburn 
Rovers Football Club.
Mr French holds a 9 per cent stake. A further 10 per cent has been allocated to an employee ownership trust 
establishing about two-thirds of the 1,650 workforce as shareholders.
Flybe has been transformed in the past three years into a low-cost airline based in the UK regions and flying chiefly 
on domestic routes, which account for about 80 per cent of its turnover, but also from the UK regions in particular to 
France and Spain.
It has developed a market niche designed largely to avoid head-to-head competition with Ryanair and EasyJet, 
which have established dominant positions in the UK and in particular in the London short-haul market.
Flybe results for the financial year to March 2005 and for the first six months of the current year are due early next 
year.

This year Mr French said the group expected to make its first operating profit - of about Pounds 10m - in five years. 
Last year, it made an operating loss of Pounds 9.8m in the year to March 2004.
Pre-tax profit for the year to March 2005 is forecast to rise from Pounds 2.9m a year earlier to Pounds 8m. The 
2003-04 pre-tax figure also benefited from a Pounds 17.2m receipt from the sale of several pairs of prime take-off 
and landing slots at Heathrow airport in a joint disposal made with Air France.
In recent months Flybe has been developing new bases, such as Norwich and Aberdeen, in addition to its main 
bases at Southampton, Birmingham and Exeter and operations at Belfast City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey and 
Guernsey.
Southend airport is also under consideration for development as a base in 2007.

Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, today said it had agreed a ten-year agreement committing it to develop Brussels 
Charleroi Airport.
As part of this agreement Ryanair will base a fourth aircraft in Charleroi, bringing its total investment in aircraft at 
Brussels Charleroi to USD240m.
The airline will open five new routes, from Brussels to Faro, Nimes, Malaga, Salzburg and Valencia from April 2006 
onwards, bringing the total number of Ryanair routes from Brussels Charleroi to 16.
 Ryanair said the new routes will deliver another quarter of a million passengers a year and bring Ryanair's annual 
traffic at Charleroi to 2.3m. "Our new 10 year deal with Brussels Charleroi Airport commits Ryanair to invest 
USD240m in new aircraft and deliver 2.3m passengers p.a. These 2.3M passengers will save E230m annually over 
the high fares charged at Zaventem Airport and based on ACI figures these passengers will generate 2,300 jobs at 
the airport and in the local Walloon region. In addition, visitors brought to the region by Ryanair's low fares will 
spend over E200m a year," Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary said.

Solutions, the IT services company that handles the wage payments of one third of the UK's workforce, has 
promised there will be no delays to crucial pre-Christmas pay, despite the explosion that destroyed its Hemel 
Hempstead head office.
Northgate's three-storey office block was largely reduced to rubble in Sunday morning's blast. But back-up IT 
systems, located at a different site, have been able to keep services operating largely as normal. The company said 
yesterday there was no indication that any December payroll transactions would be delayed.
The announcement will be a relief to customers, including a large number of local councils, supermarket groups

BAA unveiled its plans for a Pounds 2.7bn expansion of London Stansted airport yesterday. The airports group's 
scheme aims to triple the present capacity of London's third airport to about 76m passengers a year, more than the 
current size of Heathrow.
The plans, including the building of a second runway and a second terminal building, are opposed by airlines, local 
authorities and environmental and local residents' groups.
The main airlines operating at Stansted, led by Ryanair and EasyJet, said the plan was "deeply flawed and 
misleading" and urged Alistair Darling, the transport secretary, to intervene.
David O'Brien, chairman of the Stansted Airline Consultative Committee and Ryanair operations director, said the 
"unveiling of this gold-plated folly, with no supporting business plan, is testament to the failure of the current 
regulatory regime to restrain this out-of-control monopoly".
He warned that BAA would have to triple landing charges to pay for the scheme, which would drastically slow 
growth.
The Stop Stansted Expansion group said the second runway would be an "environmental catastrophe". It said the 
plan was opposed by more than 100 parish and town councils, district councils, the East of England's regional 
assembly and every MP and MEP in the region irrespective of political party.
Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex county council, said that the scheme was "unwanted, unfundable and 
unnecessary". Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, said air travel was already the fastest-growing 
contributor to climate change and "building a second runway at Stansted will allow this situation to get even worse".
The bitter debate over the funding of the so-called Stansted Generation 2 project will intensify later this month. The 
Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for BAA's three London airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - 
is due to issue in two weeks its first policy document on the setting of the next price cap regime for the five years 
from April 2008.
Expansion of Stansted condemned as flawed AIRPORT PROPOSALS
Mike Clasper, BAA chief executive, said the earliest the first phase of the Stansted scheme could be operational 
would be the end of 2013. But he warned that this would need a "satisfactory pricing formula" from the CAA to give 
BAA the incentive to deliver the second runway "as soon as possible". If the regulatory regime was "too tight", BAA 
said the project would be put back "by some years".
Earlier this year, BAA said early development of Stansted would only be possible with some element of "cross-
subsidisation" through airline user charges at Heathrow and Gatwick, a suggestion that airlines at those airports 
have pledged to fight. CAA policy also favours "stand-alone" pricing at individual airports.
A second runway at Stansted, the first new runway to be built in south-east England since the second world war, 
was recommended by the government's white paper, The Future of Air Transport, in December 2003, which called 
for completion in 2011-12 as part of the UK's most ambitious expansion of airport capacity.
BAA said its preferred "lowest cost" option at Stansted would involve investment of Pounds 2.7bn for on-airport 
developments including a 3,048-metre runway, second terminal building, taxiways, 42 aircraft stands and 
associated piers, control tower, car parking, enhanced bus and railway stations and connection to the M11 
motorway.
It claimed this was Pounds 1bn lower than the original government white paper estimates, both at 2005 prices. In 
addition, it estimated a further Pounds 500m for its share of costs to improve rail and road access focused on the 
widening of sections of the M11 and improving the capacity of the Stansted Express railway service.
Mr Clasper defended the cost of BAA's preferred scheme and said it represented a capital cost of Pounds 65 per 
extra passenger compared with Pounds 70 for a proposed expansion project at Luton airport and the Pounds 95 
per passenger paid for the second runway at Manchester airport.
Phase one of the Stansted scheme would cost Pounds 1.7bn and would raise capacity to 50m passengers a year. 
Subsequent phases would raise capacity to about 76m by 2030.
The proposals launched a public consultation exercise running to late March. It plans to publish a master-plan for a 
two-runway airport in summer next year, to be followed by an environmental impact assessment with a planning 
application due to be submitted in summer 2007, allowing a public inquiry to start in 2008.
Stansted, the most important airport in Europe for low-cost airlines, handled 21.9m passengers in the 12 months to 
November compared with 67.7m at Heathrow and 32.6m at Gatwick.
BAA forecast traffic growth at Stansted at 24.7m passengers in 2008 and 35m in 2015. The airport has planning 
permission to handle no more than 25m passengers and 241,000 takeoffs and landings.

Airport operator BAA PLC unveiled its plans Friday to build a second runway at London's Stansted Airport, putting 
the cost of the project at 2.7 billion pounds ($4US.7 billion; euro3.9 billion) _ 30 percent below previous government 
estimates.
Airlines like Ryanair and easyJet that are based at the airport, however, fear increased charges from BAA to fund 
the expansion. 
Stansted ACC, a lobby group formed by airlines at the airport, said the revised cost is still too high and called for 
alternatives to be found.
Local residents and environmental groups are also strongly opposed to the runway, which is expected to boost the 
British economy and be ready by 2013.
BAA Chief Executive Mike Clasper said that the environmental impact of the project would be reduced as much as 
possible.
"We've worked very hard in the last two years to ensure that Stansted G2 (runway two) will deliver great value to 
the U.K. economy, to our airlines and to people using the airport," Clasper said.
The second runway will boost Stansted's total capacity to around 76 million passengers a year by 2030, from the 
current 35 million.
The blueprint released Friday provides a base for discussions with local communities, airlines and other 
stakeholders, ahead of its submission for formal planning approval in 2007.
Ryanair and easyJet, which account for about 90 percent of Stansted's business, are worried they will effectively 
have to fund the expansion.

An unlikely beneficiary of Ryanair's new service from London to the Polish city of Szczecin is Cezary Turostow-ski, 
a dentist. Among the British tourists and the Polish migrant workers using the route since its launch in October is a 
steady stream of patients.
The first arrived on the inaugural flight. He was Robin Bynoe, a 32-year-old London marketing executive, who said 
after his treatment: "It was great. The service was better than I have ever had in Britain and it cost me Pounds 
2,050 instead of Pounds 5,000 or more."
East European dentists are among many profiting from a boom in low-cost air travel in the European Union's new 
member states. The market has been transformed by the countries' accession last year, which extended the EU's 
open-skies policy and ended the high-fare arrangements of national carriers.
Mr Turostowski says: "We've had patients from Germany and Denmark for several years. Ryanair is now bringing in 
people from Britain and Ireland."
Polish airports are set for a 30 per cent increase in passengers this year, including mushrooming growth at 
provincial airports such asSzÃ‚Â­czecin. In Hungary, Budapest airport's numbers were up 27 per cent in the 10 
months to October, driven by a 180 per cent rise in low-cost passengers to 1.9m. The airport is set for further 
increases in 2005-06 following the September re-opening of terminal one dedicated to budget operators.
Prague, which has long been the region's biggest hub, is expecting an 11 per cent increase. In Slovakia, Bratislava 
airport has seen an increase from below 300,000 passengers in 2001 to a forecast 1.3m this year, with nearly two-
thirds using low-cost carriers.
Competition is intense. Prague is serviced by 14 low-cost carriers. Budapest and Warsaw by seven apiece. Local 
start-ups, including Bratislava-based SkyEurope Airlines and Wizz Air, a Hungarian-Polish venture, vie with the low-

cost subsidiaries of national airlines such as Poland's LOT and with the west European pioneers of low-cost 
aviation, EasyJet and Ryanair.
The most obvious boost to the regional economy has been tourism. British stag and hen parties have become a 
feature of Prague, Budapest and Tallinn, the Estonian capital. Newer destinations include Bratislava and Krakow in 
Poland.
Local residents sometimes complain of drink-fuelled rowdiness. But serious incidents have been rare and the party-
goers are often big spenders. Gyorgy Jaksity, managing director of Concorde Securities, a Budapest broker, says 
visitors who save on the air fare spend more on hotels and restaurants. The region is also becoming a discount 
shopping destination, like New York but without the transatlantic airfare.
Like Mr Bynoe, growing numbers of visitors are attracted to low-cost healthcare and personal services. Austrians, 
Germans and Danes have long frequented the dentists, cosmetic surgeons and spa centres in the border regions of 
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland. Brothels have also done good business.
The low-cost carriers now bring in clients from further afield. Opportunities are created for entrepreneurial 
companies such as Denmark's OuchMyTooth, a web-based agency with 45 dental surgeries in eastern and 
southern Europe on its books. Asger MÃƒÂ¸nster Frydkjaer, the founder, says: "It's not just the savings. People like 
to be treated gently by their dentist. I check out my dentists personally to make sure they are gentle."
Beyond tourism and healthcare, the low-cost carriers are a boon to migrant workers, notably in Poland, which 
accounts for most of the east Europeans working in the UK. Migrants who went home once or twice a year now visit 
their families and friends every month.
Business also benefits from the low-cost carriers. Mr Domaradzki says many smaller companies that previously 
could not afford foreign trips are sending their sales people further afield. Multinationals are increasingly willing to 
move even junior staff around - bringing new recruits to their London bases for training, for example.
SkyEurope claims it is contributing to Slovakia's foreign investment boom. It says its Bratislava-Paris link 
encouraged PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, to build a Slovak car assembly plant. The airline has also 
launched a Bratislava-Stuttgart service to improve the fast-growing Slovak motor industry's ties with Germany.
The region's role as an outsourcing centre for business services also depends on good low-cost air links.
DHL, the logistics group, says that Prague's air connections were a key factor in the decision in 2004 to build a 
Euros 500m (Dollars 585m, Pounds 340m) information technology services centre in the Czech capital.
"Having users and technicians come in and out is a big part of what we do, so having good air links is very 
important," says Stephen McGuckin, head of global IT services at DHL.

Centralwings, the low-cost subsidiary of Lot Polish Airlines, is planning a rapid expansion into the British and Irish 
markets to take advantage of the growing travel needs of Polish workers in both countries, as well as to cater for 
rising leisure and business traffic.
Poland is forecast by the International Air Transport Association to be the world's fastest growing market for air 
travel in the five years 2005-09, with an average annual growth rate of 11.2 per cent. Piotr Kociolek, chief executive 
of Centralwings, said that five of the six routes it was adding in its summer schedule next year would be between 
Poland and the UK and Ireland, which would account for about 60 per cent of its capacity and forecast traffic in 
2006.
Centralwings began operations in February as the response by Lot, the state-owned Polish flag carrier, to the rapid 
expansion in its home market by other start-up low-cost carriers in eastern Europe - most importantly SkyEurope 
Airlines and Wizz Air - which have already captured significant market share, as well as by Ireland's Ryanair.
Centralwings' initial network included services from both Warsaw and Krakow to London Gatwick, and this winter it 
has added flights from Warsaw to Edinburgh and Shannon and from Katowice and Wroclaw to Dublin.
Mr Kociolek said that from next spring it would open routes between Leeds-Bradford and Warsaw, between 
Edinburgh and Katowice and Gdansk, and between Dublin and Lodz and Gdansk. "The UK and Ireland have had a 
particularly prominent impact with travel between these markets and Poland increasing by more than 50 per cent 
since the country's accession to the EU," he said.
The rush to open routes between Poland and the UK and Ireland has been joined by Ryanair, the largest European 
low-cost airline, which already flies between London Stansted and eight Polish regional cities. Its inflight magazine 
reveals another driver of the rising air traffic to Poland with advertisements appearing from dental practices 
proclaiming low-cost attractions of Polish dental care.

Ryanair's view of the prospects for the Polish market has been turned on its head since Michael O'Leary, its boss, 
dismissed it in 2004 by saying: "Who wants to go to Gdansk? There isn't a lot there after you've seen the shipyard 
wall."

Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC announced five new routes Thursday, including its first service to 
Hungary.
The new routes begin with daily services between Stansted and Vitoria in Spain on Feb. 17, 2006.
The following day Ryanair will start services three times a week between Stansted and Balaton in Hungary, and 
between Stansted and Lamezia in Italy.
On Feb. 21 the low-cost carrier will start another three-flights-a-week service, from Luton to Brest in France.
The last of the new routes, a four-flights-a-week service from Stansted to Parma in Italy, will start on March 31.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that Western Europe remained the driver and focus of growth for the 
carrier despite its steps into central Europe. The airline began five new routes to Poland and Slovakia last month.
"The real action here is still in Western Europe," O'Leary said in London.
O'Leary said that Ryanair plans to announce details of another base airport in Europe by early January. It now has 
15 base airports, including London's Stansted and Dublin Airport.
The airline has 281 routes across Europe and carried 35 million passengers this year.

Chris Stone, chief executive of Northgate Information Solutions, is planning a series of European acquisitions to 
accelerate growth at the IT software and services company.
Mr Stone is understood to have targeted about eight private businesses in continental Europe; he hasmore than 
Pounds 100m to spend.
Northgate, which provides human resources and payroll software to clients such as Tesco and Manchester United, 
said its market share in the UK was now so large that it was having to look elsewhere for further growth.
The company has already begun to move into European markets through multi-country contracts with its UK-based 
clients, and recently won pan-European deals with Ryanair and McAfee. Acquisitions would accelerate this 
progress.
Though the HR business was reaching saturation in the UK, Mr Stone said there was plenty of growth left for the 
public sector business.
While chancellor Gordon Brown's reduction of the UK economic growth forecast would mean a squeeze on some 
public funding, Mr Stone said many local authorities would remain reliant on Northgate's technology to help them 
deliver the Pounds 21.5bn in savings identified by the Gershon efficiency review.
The comments came as Northgate unveiled a 68 per cent increase in revenues to Pounds 162.7m in the six months 
to the end of October, largely boosted by the Pounds 143.3m acquisition of rival SX3 in March.
Pre-tax profits dipped slightly from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 10m, reflecting costs from the SX3 acquisition. 
Earnings per share fell from 1.5p to 1.22p. There is no dividend.
Shares in Northgate, which have gained nearly 50 per cent in value over the past year, fell 5 1/4p to 87 1/4p 
yesterday.
FT Comment
Northgate planning to spend in Europe SOFTWARE
* Northgate's rising revenue is encouraging, but investors were yesterday concerned about an organic growth rate 
of 4 to 5 per cent which is almost half what some peers are achieving. Management time has been absorbed 
integrating SX3 - leading some to accuse the company of being "unable to walk and chew gum at the same time". 
Mr Stone has pledged to return the company to 7 to 8 per cent organic growth in the next two years, but with an 
impending buying spree, it remains to be seen whether he can pull it off. Northgate shares have had a great run this 
year. At nearly 16 times full-year earnings estimates, the shares look fully valued.

Two of the planes were being boarded at that time and the passengers had to be evacuated from the terminal until 
the all-clear almost three hours later.
 The threat proved to be a hoax that left hundreds of passengers stranded at Rome's second airport. "This 
extensive delay meant that Ryanair's first wave of four flights from Rome Ciampino Airport this morning and three

Low-cost airline, Ryanair, today said that many of its Dublin pilots have received windfalls of over E60,000 each by 
selling their share options, which became exercisable from yesterday.
Based on today's share price of E7.50 the options have a value of E190,000, Ryanair said.
The share options form part of the collective 5 year pay, benefit and share option scheme that the Dublin pilots 
negotiated directly with the airline in November 2000 and are the ninth tranche of options which Ryanair's Dublin 
pilots have enjoyed over each of the past nine years.
 The total value of these options to each qualifying Dublin pilot since Ryanair floated in 1997 is almost E500,000 
and if disposed of at the exercise date, they have generated a total profit of almost E300,000 for each qualifying 
Dublin pilot, Ryanair said.

Body
The sale of part of the Sainsbury family's holding in the UK's third-biggest supermarket group has highlighted the 
tricky issue of how to offload significant stakes without the market moving against you.
On Monday, the group said that Judith Portrait, who oversees the blind trust that holds Lord (David) Sainsbury's 19 
per cent stake, planned to sell some of those shares.
In itself, this was not as alarming news as it might once have been. For one thing, the stake being sold is small - the 
20m shares represent just more than 1 per cent of J Sainsbury's total share capital. For another, Ms Portrait said 
she planned to sell the shares "at prices above the current prevailing market price".
As a result, the stock barely moved.
However, disposing of blocks held in the name of the founding family, or other equally strategic stakes, is not 
always so simple. Other investors can take fright if they hear of such a move and force the price lower.
There are several companies in the UK where a family or leading institution is particularly associated with them.
These include the Weston family, which owns 54 per cent of Associated British Foods; the family of Singapore's 
late Khoo Teck Puat, which owns a 13 per cent stake in Standard Chartered, the emerging markets bank; and the 
Haji-Ioannou family, which owns about 40 per cent of budget airline EasyJet.
For any of them to sell significant amounts suddenly might well raise expectations that the company would become 
a takeover target. Michael O'Leary has cut his holding in Ryanair substantially in recent years but the fact that he 
trims his holding regularly means investors are no longer alarmed.
"The block business is becoming a bigger part of our day-to-day business," says Darren Kutner, head of cash 
trading at Morgan Stanley.
Selling without making waves Philip Stafford details the ways in which investment banks execute big market 
deals discreetly
It used to be the case that a bank would sign an agreement with its client to underwrite the whole placing of shares 
with institutional investors: this means the bank would take on any stock that it could not sell.
The price would be fixed the night before, based on previous trading patterns, the analyst's views and, crucially, 
discreet chats with select investors. Sometime around 8.00am the following morning, the bank would hit the 
telephones to talk to the institutions.
"It used to be that if you wanted to sell a line of your stock, you had a word with your friends and quietly got out of 
that position over weeks and months," says one corporate financier at a large investment bank.
Today, banks are much better capitalised and compete aggressively with each other to offer the client the best 
price. They buy the stock themselves and take it on to their own books. If all goes well, they make a turn. If it does 
not, as is quite often the case, they can be left holding a large chunk of stock.
This is called a block trade, but there are some quite sophisticated alternatives.
One is called the accelerated book-building process. This is a speeded-up version of the block trade that allows the 
bank and client to take advantage of particularly favourable market conditions. The whole deal can be wrapped up 
in a couple of hours, instead of a couple of weeks. However, it does not work so well for tricky issues that need 
more work.
But there are ways in which to sell significant stakes without flagging it to the market beforehand. For example, 
Standard Life used derivatives to obscure its forced sale of equities in February 2004.
The Scottish-based life assurer was obliged to sell Pounds 7.5bn of equities after the Financial Services Authority 
forced it to meet tougher solvency requirements.
Technology has brought other options. For example, algorithmic trading is a system that uses very advanced 
mathematical models for making transaction decisions.
Software models attempt to determine the optimal time for an order to be placed and cause the least amount of 
impact on a stock's price. Large blocks of shares are usually purchased by dividing it into smaller lots and allowing 
the complex algorithms to decide when the smaller blocks are to be bought.
The aim of this approach is to enable both the seller and the buyer to hide their intentions to the rest of the market.
Nevertheless, other software sometimes allows rivals to detect the trading pattern.
However, says Mr Kutner of Morgan Stanley, "it doesn't have the immediacy of a placement. It still has to be 
worked through over a period of time".
For all the technological wizardry, the old fashioned way remains more attractive than ever.
Bank balance sheets are now so strong that, whereas only five years ago, they could only digest two or three block 
trades a year, the large investment banks can now handle at least 50 block trades a year.
Such is the competition between the banks, many of these deals are done at a loss to the banks.
But that is not the problem for whoever is selling the stock.

When the first Ryanair jet touched down last month at Bydgoszcz airport, hundreds of local people came to 
welcome the aircraft and its passengers.
It continued that way for the first few days of the service, which connects the city in northern Poland and London's 
Stansted Airport. People were delighted to greet friends and relatives and proud to see their city on the list of the 
world's international airports.
Tomasz Makowski, the airport director, said: "Today, a city without an airport is a city without connectionsin the 
world of business, travel and tourism."
Air travel is booming across Poland, especially the low-cost version provided by operators including Ryanair and 
easyJet and local rivals such as Wizz Air and Central Wings, a subsidiary of Lot, the national airline.
In the first nine months of 2005, the number of passengers using Polish airports jumped 32 per cent to 8.7m, 
compared with an European average increase of 6 per cent.
The market has been transformed by Poland's entry last year to the European Union, which extended the EU's 
open-skies policy to the accession states and ended the cosy high-fare agreements of the national carriers that had 
dominated the market.
As well as strengthening links between western Europe and Warsaw and other big cities, airline operators are 
opening new routes, such asStansted to Bydgoszcz.
Alongside people travelling for business and pleasure, the flights are playing a big role in improving transport links 
for the hundreds of thousands of Polish workers in western Europe.
Regional cities reach for the sky LOW-COST AIRLINES: Cheap flights have presented the provinces with an 
unexpected way to overcome the barriers of poor local in....
People who could afford to visit their friends and families once a year have now started making monthly or even 
weekly trips.
Such connections are particularly important to Bydgoszcz because it has poor road and rail links to the rest of 
Poland. The cities of Poznan and Gdansk, which have airports, are two hours away by car. Warsaw is a drive of 
more than three hours.
Also, as Grzegorz Dudzinski, the head of the city's newly-established technology park, says, Bydgoszcz is a city 
that feels it has been overlooked, even within Poland.
With a population of 370,000, it is considerably larger than neighbouring Torun which is home to 210,000. But 
Torun is known throughout Poland asthe home of Copernicus, the medieval astronomer, and overshadows 
Bydgoszcz.
Mr Dudzinski says: "The big problem in Bydgoszcz is a lack of profile. The airport will help us deal with this."
Konstanty Dombrowicz, the mayor, hopes it will attract business people and tourists and generate jobs in a region 
where unemployment is 20 per cent. City officials cite calculations which show that one job is created for every 
1,000 passengers.
No wonder Mr Dombrowicz is pleased with Ryanair, which has already sold 20,000 Bydgoszcz tickets and plans for 
100,000 in the first year. That would bring 100 jobs, plus any created by business visitors who later decided to 
invest.
The competition among the operators is cut-throat, with several vying to emerge as market leader. According to 
Poland's Civil Aviation Office, themarket leader among the low-cost operators in the first six months of 2005 was 
Wizz Air, which is based in Hungary and Poland.
Ryanair, which launched its first Polish services only in March, iscatching up fast, with eight airports in operation, 
more than any other low-cost airline. Also growing rapidly are Slovakia-based SkyEurope and Central Wings.
Operators have been quick to adapt to Poland's undeveloped economic conditions, where most people still do not 
have bank accounts, credit cards or internet access. Central Wings, for example, is pioneering a system for 
customers to buy tickets for cash at petrol stations.
The Civil Aviation Authority forecasts that market growth will inevitably slow from the current annualrate of more 
than 30 per cent to 17 to 20 per cent next year, and not less than15 per cent a year thereafter. But that will still be 
far ahead of the European average.
Aleksander Domaradzki, a transport specialist at PwC, the management consultancy, says the Polish market is still 
relatively undeveloped compared with western Europe. In spite of the recent increases in travel, Poles flyrelatively 
infrequently so there is plenty of potential, he says.
Low-cost lines want to capture 50 per cent of the market, compared with 25 per cent today. But not all the 
companies will emerge as winners. One low-cost line, Air Polonia, has ceased trading after running into financial 
difficulties. But that has not stopped others from making plans.
Mr Domaradzki says: "There is still room for new players, but it is becoming more difficult as the established 
operators have an advantage."
However, constraints will emerge as the market develops. Some airports have limited facilities and all face 
considerable investment preparing their passport control offices for Poland's entry into the EU's Schengen bloc. 
Also, road and rail links often remain poor, limiting access to airports and reducing the attractions of short trips.
Regional cities reach for the sky LOW-COST AIRLINES: Cheap flights have presented the provinces with an 
unexpected way to overcome the barriers of poor local in....
But if the example of Bydgoszcz is any guide, Poles will try to make the most of their travel opportunities. The 
young migrant workers who are so prominent in the passenger lists are not just travelling for jobs - they want to see 
the world.

EasyJet has learnt a lot since its disastrous profit warnings in 2004. More careful management of investor 
expectations meant that a slightly better-than-expected second-half performance received an exuberant share price 
reception yesterday.
The 11 per cent rise was due not only to a respectable increase in operating profits, combined with some nice cost 
control. Investors are also betting on a bid by FL Group, which owns Icelandair, and at least 16 per cent of EasyJet. 
The Icelandic investment group recently agreed to buy Sterling Airways, Europe's fourth-largest low-cost airline, but 
its intentions concerning EasyJet are mysterious.
Acquiring British assets is Iceland's flavour of the month, and one which is famously shared by FL Group board 
member Jon Asgeir Johannesson, who is also chief executive of Baugur.
Nevertheless, this possibility does not justify the price. At 340p, the shares currently trade on 23 times next year's 
consensus earnings, way above Ryanair's 16 times, despite the latter's superior profitability. Prospective buyers 
may also be put off by the 41 per cent stake held by Stelios Haji-Ioannou and family, as well as a ban on foreign 
ownership - albeit probably negotiable - of over 45 per cent.
That said, EasyJet is going through a vulnerable phase. The board looks like a game of musical chairs, a new 
finance director joined in March, and a new chief executive, who has never worked in airlines, comes on board in 
December. Mr Haji-Ioannou last sold EasyJet shares at 370p to 380p. Maybe investors' exuberance is not so 
irrational after all.

Highlight: EasyJet has reported a better-than-expected 9pc increase in full year profit.
Body
easyJet, Europe's second largest no-frills airline and Ryanair's main rival, has reported a better-than-expected 9pc 
increase in full year profit and forecast "mid to high single-digit" profit growth for its current year.
For the year to end-Sept 2006 the Luton-based carrier expects to deliver capacity growth, measured by available 
seats, of 15pc.
It anticipates a 3-5pc reduction in cost per seat, before fuel, and while it expects a "slight reduction" in total revenue 
per seat (average fares), ancillary revenues will improve with "double digit percentage growth" supported by a 
series of new initiatives.
 For the year to Sept 30 2005 easyJet, which serves 212 European routes, made a pre-tax profit of £68m compared 
to analysts' consensus forecast of £63m and £62.2m achieved last year. The outcome reflected a 23pc increase in 
revenue to £1.34bn on passengers up 21.4pc to 29.6 mln, offset by a 47pc increase in the fuel bill. Unit revenue 
(total revenue per seat flown) increased 2.1pc to £38.66, benefiting from a 17pc increase in ancillary revenue.

TODAY
*Workspace, the FTSE 250 small business landlord,will be expected to clarify a potential takeover situation when it 
announces interim results. A spike in its share price last Monday forcedit to reveal the next daythat it had received a 
tentative approach. This isnow understood not to be from a UK-listed property company. The group will be asked 
whether the personor group in question is likely to pursue its interest further. The group's shareprice is already at a 
large premium to its lastpublished net asset valueper share of 235p. Andwith a tiny dividend yield of 1 per cent, a 
predator may be hard-pressed to justify the price needed to buy the group.
TOMORROW
*EasyJet, the second largest European low-cost airline, is expected to report virtually unchanged pre-tax profit for 
its financial year to the end of September of about Pounds 63m in line with its trading update in early October. The 
airline's turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.34bn, but its profit has been under pressure, most importantly 
from the jump in its fuel costsdue to the surge in oil prices in the past year. Its passenger volumes rose by 21.4per 
cent to 29.6m making EasyJet a close number two to Ireland's Ryanair among European no frills airlines. Investors 
will be waiting most keenly for EasyJet's guidance on the outlook for the current financial year from Ray Webster, 
who is about to retire at the endof the month as chief executive after spending more than nine years with theairline. 
He is being replaced by Andrew Harrison, formerly chief executive of RAC. More importantly for the share price, 
however, EasyJet was trading last week close to its recent 12-month high of 312p, as investors continued to 
speculate on a takeover bid for the airline from Iceland's FL Group. The Icelandic investment group has already 
built up a stake of 16.18 per cent, just behind the 16.6 per cent stake held by Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's 
founder who returned to the board last spring after resigning as chairman and leaving the board in November 2002.
*Enterprise Inns announces full-year results this week which are expected to be comfortably within analysts' 
expectations of between Pounds 294m and Pounds 308m after a number of purchases in the past two years. 
However, analysts are likely to be more interested in what Enterprise has to say about the current round of 
acquisitions in the sector. The group is probably sniffing round for small-scale bolt-on purchases but may have 
ambitious plans to take on rival Punch Taverns and re-enter the bidding for the Spirit Group pubs. More likely, 
Workspace set to clarify approach COMPANIES DIARY
however, is an announcement that the group has gone the other way and will return surplus cash to investors 
through a share buy-back scheme expected to be in the region of Pounds 200m. Either way, analysts will be 
looking for reassurance that Enterprise is improving its profitability per pub and taking full advantage of increased 
drinking hours to confirm the consensus prediction of about 10 per cent profit growth next year.
THURSDAY
*British Land, the second largest property company in the UK, is due to announce its interim results. The group 
owns and develops office buildings, shopping centres and warehouses throughout the UK, including the Broadgate 
Estate in London and the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. The City will be watching to see how British 
Land's results compare with those of Land Securities, its larger rival, which smashed forecasts when it reported last 
week. It also expects an update on the sale of the group's Pounds 300m residential portfolio, for which HBOS and 
Grainger Trust are bidding. The consensus analysts' forecast for adjusted net asset value - the key measure of 
property group's performance - is Pounds 12.10 per share, compared with Pounds 11.11 in May this year and 
Pounds 10.49 a year ago. UBS has forecast (under IFRS) recurring revenue earnings per share of 13.5p (13.9p in 
the first half), a dividend per share of 5.2p (up 8 per cent) and recurring revenue pre-tax profit of Pounds 87.2m.

Many Irish people have been far too busy making money in the past few years to consider going to business school 
to be taught how to make money.
But there are signs that more are starting to acknowledge the value of a business school education. Last month 
there were two important developments. Trinity College, Dublin, announced it was linking up with the Irish 
Management Institute to create a new graduate school, which it said would be ranked in the top 25 in the world 
within the decade. Meanwhile, Dublin City University formally opened its Tony Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship, 
named after the founder of Ryanair, the low-cost airline.
In some ways the two initiatives illustrate rival trends. Trinity, in much the same way as Oxford University did when 
it transferredthe executive short courses run from Templeton College to Said Business School to create a central 
source of management education in Oxford, believes it is better served harnessing its academic and research clout 
to a better-endowed private sector management institute.
An immediate advantage is that the new school will have much financial freedom to hire the teachers and lecturers 
it wants, as it will no longer be so constrained by civil service pay guidelines which otherwise apply to university 
employees.
The DCU academy on the other hand is a throwback to an earlier model of business school, one named after, 
branded and financed by a well-known local business personality, a model popular in the US.
"I didn't have any particular ambition to have my name on the top of a building, but I think Ireland could benefit from 
a college like this. And I think it can derive benefit from the Ryanair aura, for want of a better word, which has a 
strong relationship with young people here and on the continent," says Mr Ryan.
Philanthropists adopt a more discerning style CHARITABLE GIVING: Wealthy entrepreneurs in Ireland are 
helping to finance the education of the country's future h....
Mr Ryan's association with DCU is typical of many self-made business people who feel they want to give something 
back to society.
Sir Michael Smurfit, Ireland's paper and packaging millionaire, was in many ways the pioneer withhis Euros 6m 
(Pounds 4.1m) donation to University College Dublin to establish the Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business.
Lochlann Quinn, a former chairman of Allied Irish Banks, contributed Euros 5m to found the Quinn School of 
Business for undergraduates, also part of UCD.
On a smaller scale, a number of individuals have sponsored chairs of business studies such as Philip Berber, a US 
businessman educated at DCU, who sold his online brokerage company to Charles Schwab for Euros 500m just 
before the dotcom crash of 2001. He also gave Euros 100m to set up a charity to help the poor in Ethiopia.
"There's actually not much else you can do with Euros 100m which is tax efficient except give it away," says Tom 
McCarthy, the chief executive of the Irish Management Institute.
Fundraising may be a big part of the financing of larger business schools, but Damien McLoughlin, chief executive 
of the Smurfit school, says that he does not even budget for donations.
"I was at Stanford recently and was told they relied on donations for 50 per cent of their funding. I don't think we 
have any such ambition," he says.
The names of the Smurfit Business schools donors are given pride of place in the entrance hall, displayed on 
honours boards on removable panels rather like a squash club ladder but arranged in order of the size of the 
donation.
"Irish-Americans are also starting to question whether Ireland really needs continued financial support. Itwas easy a 
few years ago. But now people say, 'well hang on, isn't Ireland meant to be Europe's fastest-growing economy?'", 
says Mr McLoughlin.
Those who do contribute are more discerning. John Murray, professor of business studies at Trinity, says: "You no 
longer get money from benefactors just by appealing to them to support the old sod. A lot ofcorporate benefactors 
today want a more programmatic approach." All agree that fundraising will get harder rather than easier.
Most Irish schools are either not old enough or large enough to have a community of rich alumni ready to support 
them. Mr McLoughlin says that among Ireland's new rich the habits of philanthropy are not well-developed, although 
he acknowledges the big-name donors such as Sir Michael or Mr Ryan can encourage others.
At DCU, Mr Ryan's three sons, Cathal, Declan and Shane, have donated Euros 7m to build the new school, an 
Ã‚Â­eye­catching building on a site donated by the developersof the Citywest Business Campus, just outside 
Dublin.
Mr Ryan is committing an additional Euros 10m to support a bursary for those who cannot afford the fees.
"I don't want to lead with my chin on this, but I wouldn't have any problem picking up the fees for some young 
people, provided they could prove in a clinical hard-headed way that they should be there," he says.
Part of the deal allowed the three sons to claim tax relief for the amount of the donation. But as a result, the 
academy will not be able to seek public money.
"I hope the business model is robust enough. I think it is important that the academy is entrepreneurial too, and 
doesn't depend on subsidies," says Mr Ryan.
The inspiration for the academy was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Entrepreneurship Ã‚Â­Centre run 
by Kenneth Morse. Mr Morse is on the academy's advisory panel and is helping DCU find a director.

"MIT is business networking at its best. They bringin the leading chief executives to talk to the students. They bring 
in the investment banks to look atwhat's going on and the banks are always curiousas to who is going to bethe next 
Bill Gates," saysMr Ryan.
Mr Ryan says that before he looked at the work of the centre at MIT, he was sceptical that entrepreneurship could 
be taught. But he does acknowledge it will be difficult to structure business courses to produce the entrepreneurs of 
the future in what is a rapidly changing economy.
"This was a plan devised several years ago. If you had had an idea then to set up a school for, say, property 
entrepreneurship, you'd have been left with an empty building by now because everyone would be out there doing 
it."

Frankfurt-Hahn could become Ryanair's second-largest operational basefollowing a tie-up between the German 
regional airport and Europe's leading low-cost airline announced this month.
Ryanair has agreed a deal with Frankfurt-Hahn airport that will triple its presence at the German airport by 2012.
For the first time, the Irish low-cost carrier has agreed to participate directly in financing the expansion of one of its 
base airports and has committed itself to providing a Euros 12.5m (Pounds 8.5m) loan to fund 50 per cent of the 
capital expenditure for a new passenger terminal.
Ryanair said that it would increase the number of aircraft based at Hahn, a former US fighter base located 60 miles 
west of Frankfurt, from six at present to 18 by 2012.
The group said the planned rate of growth could allow Hahn to overtake its home base in Dublin to become its 
second-largest in Europe after London Stansted, where it currently has 39 aircraft based and a network of 86 
routes.
The loan to part-finance the development of the passenger terminal at Hahn was a sign of its "commitment" to the 
expansion of the airport but it was "not interested" in part-ownership or the operation of the airport, said a Ryanair 
representative.
The group also planned to establish a maintenance facility at Hahn.
It planned to add aircraft - 189-seat Boeing 737-800s - at the rate of two a year with the target of increasing its 
passenger volumes from 3m in 2005 to 8m by 2012, with the number of routes served from Hahn doubling from 27 
to more than 50.
Commitment to German airport sets the scene for Ryanair 's expansion Frankfurt-Hahn could become the Irish 
airline's second-largest base, writes Kevin Done
The German airport is owned 65 per cent byFraport, the operator of Frankfurt airport, and 17.5 per cent each by the 
states of Hesse and Rhineland Palatinate.
The airport is planning investments of Euros 185m between 2006 and 2011, including an extension of the runway 
and new taxiways and aircraft stands.
Ryanair accounts for the lion's share of passenger volumes at Hahn but the airport also has services from two other 
low-cost carriers, Hungary's Wizz Air and Iceland Express, and is developing as a centre for air cargo.
Ryanair has the broadest presence across Europe of any airline with 15 bases in seven countries.
It has opened Cork in Ireland as a base this month and will add Nottingham East Midlands in March next year. It 
has five bases in the UK including Luton, Glasgow Prestwick and Liverpool and three bases in Ireland including 
Dublin and Shannon.
In continental Europe, it has three bases in Italy at Rome Ciampino, Milan-Bergamo and Pisa as well as bases at 
Barcelona-Gerona in Spain, Stockholm-Skavsta in Sweden, Brussels-Charleroi in Belgium and Frankfurt-Hahn.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said this month that the airline was planning to double both profit and 
passenger volumes by 2012. It has forecast that it will carry 35m passengers in the financial year to the end of 
March, rising to more than 70m in 2012, by which time it plans to have 30 bases across Europe.
By the end of March, Ryanair will be operating a single type fleet of 107 Boeing 737-800s with firm orders on a 
further 127 aircraft for delivery during the next seven years.

Ryanair may not be especially flattered by the company it is keeping, but Europe's leading low-cost carrier appears 
alongside British Airways and Virgin, among the companies making the fastest progress up the leader board of the 
world's most respected companies.
All three still have some way to go to catch up with Southwest Airlines, the pioneering US low-cost carrier, which 
arguably has done more than any other airline in recent decades to change the face of the world aviation industry 
by inventing the low-cost carrier business model in the early 1970s.
It has appeared consistently in the list of the top 25 most respected companies - dropping only one place from 12 to 
13 this year, a performance that has mirrored its unrivalled achievement in reporting 33 years of consecutive profits 
in one of the world's most highly cyclical industries.
Ireland's Ryanair has been one of its most fervent imitators, following the low-cost model with rigorous zeal to make 
itself probably the world's most profitable airline measured by profit margin. It recently reported a 25.6 per cent net 
margin in the first six months of its current business year.
It has climbed from 67 to 33 in the list of the most respected companies with its larger-than-life chief executive, 
Michael O'Leary making even faster progress from 61 to 18 among the most respected industry leaders.
Mr O'Leary has recently indicated that he may wish to retire in three to four years, having led the airline as chief 
executive since 1994, but in the meantime his ambitions are hardly diminished.
He has told investors that the airline expects to double both profits and passenger volumes in the next five years, 
taking passenger numbers from 35m in 2005 to more than 70m by 2011. By that time it would clearly have 
overtaken the biggest European airlines Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and BA to become the leading short-haul 
carrier in Europe.
The group already has the broadest geographic presence of any airline in Europe, with 15 operating bases in seven 
countries including five in the UK, three in Ireland and three in Italy, and Mr O'Leary's vision sees this growing to 30 
bases by 2012.
High-flying airlines still trail low-cost pioneer
The aircraft have already been ordered to support such a rate of growth. By the end of its current financial year in 
March it will have a single type fleet of 107 189-seat Boeing 737-800s, and firm orders have been placed for a 
further 127 to be delivered during the next seven years.
Both British Airways and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin group, led by his flagship company Virgin Atlantic Airways, 
have also made great strides in recent years, showing that success in the airline industry is not limited to the low-
cost sector.
BA has emerged from the traumas of the aviation industry's worst financial crisis to record the highest operating 
profit of any airline in the world last year. It is still some way from reaching its target of a 10 per cent operating 
margin across the trading cycle - a goal it has never achieved in its history - but it is in more robust shape than for 
many years.
It has recently managed an apparently seamless transition of chief executive from Sir Rod Eddington, who has 
decided to retire to his native Australia after five-and-a half years running the UK flag carrier, to Willie Walsh, the 
youthful 43-year-old former chief executive of Aer Lingus, the Irish state-owned airline.
Sir Rod comes into the list of the world's most respected business leaders at 29, just as he retires from BA to 
concentrate on a series of non-executive roles including his position as the senior non-executive director at Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corporation.
During the Eddington era BA cut more than 14,000 jobs or around 25 per cent of its workforce, as it restructured to 
ensure its survival in the wake of the crisis in global aviation triggered by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in 
the US.
The pressure for change is only likely to grow under Mr Walsh, who faces tough industrial relations challenges, as 
he seeks to tackle sensitive issues such as the airline's mounting pensions deficit.
BA also has a once in a lifetime opportunity to drive through reforms, however, as it restructures its operations at its 
global hub, London Heathrow airport.
In March 2008 it will transfer all its activities there to the new Terminal Five, the Pounds 4.2bn project under 
development by BAA, the airport operator, and currently one of the biggest construction projects in Europe with 
around 7,500 workers on site.
Sir Richard and the achievements of his Virgin brand have consistently rated highly in the surveys of the most 
respected companies and business leaders with Virgin jumping from 44 to 27 this year, one place above BA.
Virgin Atlantic, which has prospered as the upstart challenger to BA, is again growing quickly after overcoming the 
problems of the steep decline in demand for air travel in the wake of September 11.
Sir Richard is planning to double the size of the airline during the next five years, as he adds new routes from 
London to India, the Caribbean, Sydney and Dubai and increases frequencies on the core routes across the North 
Atlantic to the US. Virgin Atlantic is the only UK airline to have ordered the A380, the Airbus superjumbo and the 
world's largest passenger aircraft, with its first delivery currently expected in 2009.
Arguably his bravest move, however, has been the start-up of Virgin Nigeria, a new flag carrier for Nigeria and one 
of the few full service airlines to be launched worldwide in recent years solely with private finance. It is owned 49 
per cent by Virgin Atlantic and 51 per cent by Nigerian institutional investors.
The venture represents a serious risk for the Virgin brand with the launch of a new airline in a region with one of the 
world's worst aviation safety records. But the Virgin group hopes to reap big benefits from the establishment of a 
carrier using "the best international standards" in an area that promises much faster growth than more developed 
markets.

The customer services rankings have a strong technology feel. Below Toyota at the top are the computer 
manufacturer, Dell, IBM, now increasingly a services group, and, of course Microsoft. Amazon.com is rated in 12th 
place. But there are also many companies featured that have more traditional links with consumers, such as 
Disney, Wal-Mart and McDonald's.
The survey provides such a wealth of data that some of the most interesting points can emerge from a comparison 
of different lists. For example, Ryanair is ranked 33rd in terms of respected companies but is nowhere in the list for 
customer service. Both DHL and Federal Express are highly rated in customer service terms but do not make the 
top 50 in the overall rankings.
When it comes to innovation, Toyota is the best-ranked company after Microsoft, moving ahead of Sony which 
drops down to fifth place. There is some encouragement for Boeing, which dropped out of the most respected 
rankings, but is the highest new entrant in the innovation category. And technophiles will not be surprised to see 
that Research in Motion, manufacturer of the BlackBerry, also makes it into the innovation top 50.
Executives will be well aware that their time in the spotlight can be fleeting. But the rankings of most respected 
business leaders are remarkable for who is still included as well as those who have dropped out. Jack Welch's 
continued high ranking is perhaps not surprising given that he is seen as the architect of GE's success but Sam 
Walton is still ranked number 16 in the list, more than a decade after his death. "He changed the rules and model of 
creating business" is one comment about the Wal-Mart founder.
The highest new entrant in the top 30 is the septuagenarian Rupert Murdoch whose success with the Fox TV 
networks seems to have earned him the respect his newspaper empire did not. One chief executive praises his 
"ruthlessness and his capacity to take tough decisions".
Steve Jobs will also be pleased, as the Apple boss leaps from ninth to fourth place. "He has swum against the tide 
and 90 per cent of the time, he is right," says one CEO. "A classic example of how an individual can positively affect 
a company," says another.
But it is goodbye in top 50 terms to Carly Fiorina, the ex-Hewlett Packard boss, ranked eight last year, to the 
outgoing Jurgen Schrempp of DaimlerChrysler and to Michael Eisner, who faced a shareholder revolt at Disney. 
Revenge is sweet for Gates and Microsoft
Given the credit downgrades in the auto industry, it is no surprise that both William Clay Ford junior and Richard 
Wagoner of General Motors also drops down the list.
Disney is one prominent example of a company which earns the respect of its peers but without the benefit of a top-
ranked business leader. Others include Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Honda and Citigroup.
But perhaps the most intriguing of all the lists is that compiled from the votes of NGOs. Non-governmental 
organisations have often been highly critical of the corporate sector and of some companies in particular. So it is 
rather surprising to see Wal-Mart, often a target of criticism, ranked at number two in terms of community 
commitment and to see the oil companies BP and Royal Dutch/Shell ranked at fifth and ninth respectively. Those 
who work in the companies' public relations departments have reason to be pleased.

The ISEQ index of Irish shares soared more than 56 points through the 6800 level today.
The rise came against the background of continuing major gains on markets in the US, where both the Nasdaq 
Composite and the S and P 500 set four year highs.
Gains across the board in Dublin left the ISEQ up 56.75 at 6806.64 as the close approached.
 News that Elan had received a Biologics licence for their troubled product, Tysabri helped shares up 36c for the 
day on 921. There were also gains in the financial sector, with AIB up 17c to 1735 and Bank of Ireland adding 8c to 
stand on 1298. Meanwhile, Irish Life and Permanent rose by 30c to 1560. Shares in Paddy Power continued to 
recover after yesterday's major fall with gains of 10c leaving the bookmaker on 1050. The Indo remained steady on 
228, while eircom made modest gains rising 4c to stand on 225. Elsewhere, Ryanair saw its shares rise 11c to 739.

After Ken Livingstone on Wednesday (see Mudlark, November 17), it was Ryanair's turn to be shamed into 
changing a transport policy yesterday.
Following the rumpus last month when the airline threw 9 blind people off a plane (before take-off, of course), on 
the grounds that they exceeded its self-imposed safety maximum of four "reduced mobility passengers" per flight, 
Ryanair has now decided not to limit the number of "vision-impaired passengers" so long as each one brings a 
sighted companion.
And that's a human companion - guide dogs are welcome too but with a limit of two per flight.

British Airways is planning to restructure its lossmaking UK regional business, BA CitiExpress, with expected job 
losses, the pruning of the network and the fleet, and the possible closure of more of its UK regional bases.
Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said yesterday that the changes would be announced early next year. "We must 
reverse the financial losses," he said.
BA is closing routes from Manchester to Cork, Nice, Pisa, Rome, Stuttgart and Venice in March next year and 
pulling out of Manchester routes to Zurich and Shannon in mid-September.
It is also suspending Birmingham to Rome and Vienna. In the UK regions, BA is facing fierce pressure from the 
rapid growth of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet.
CitiExpress has a workforce of about 1,500. BA has already closed its operations at Belfast, Plymouth, Cardiff and 
Leeds-Bradford airports.
Mr Walsh said: "CitiExpress is a financial challenge to us. We intend to restructure it early in the new year. Its 
performance is not good enough. All parts of the business must contribute to us reaching the target of a 10 per cent 
operating profit margin."
He said that, overall, BA's European short-haul operations would be profitable in the financial year to March 2006 
for the first time since the mid-1990s.
BA confirmed it was planning to increase the capacity devoted to its lucrative premium passengers, who generate 
the lion's share of its profit, by sacrificing some economy seats in its long-haul fleet and increasing the size of the 
business class cabins on some aircraft.
Mr Walsh said BA's business class product would be "the best in the air", although the airline has accepted 
privately thatseveral aspects of its Club World cabins had begunto fall behind the competition.
BA in shake-up of lossmaking arm TRANSPORT
Mr Walsh also warned that the airline must take urgent action to reform its pension scheme if the growing deficit 
was not to impair the group's ability to invest in new aircraft.
Mr Walsh said BA needed "to be very conscious about its pension deficit in everything we do," adding: "It must be 
tackled and sorted out once and for all. It could be a significant factor in investing in new aircraft." The airline has 
one of the biggest pension deficits compared with its stock market value of any of the companies in the FTSE 100 
index.
It has already started consultations with its staff, who are braced for demands from the airline either to cut their 
benefits or to increase their contributions.
The pension deficit is calculated by some analysts at about Pounds 2bn.
Mr Walsh said BA was contributing five times more than its employees to the pension funds on average compared 
with a ratio recommended by the trade unions of two-to-one.
He said: "We are well outside the norm. That is not sustainable and must be addressed."

Asset sales allowed Iberia Airlines, the Spanish flag-carrier, to report a 168 per cent year-on-year surge in nine-
months profits yesterday, although the underlying results reflected a difficult operating environment.
The company said consolidated net profits to September were Euros 401.8m (Dollars 470m), against Euros 150m 
in the year-ago period. The result included a one-off gain of Euros 635m from the sale of part of its stake in 
Amadeus, the global reservations system.
The sale, to a private equity consortium, drove up third-quarter net profits to Euros 372.6m, from Euros 87.9m in the 
same period of 2004.
The benefits of the sale were partially offset by a Euros 280m provision linked to an early retirement scheme, which 
is part of drive to cut costs at the airline.
Senior executives have warned that rising fuel costs and competition from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and 
EasyJet could push Iberia into loss over the next few years. They are looking for savings and additional revenues 
worth up to Euros 600m by 2008.
The airline is still seeking concessions from pilots and other union members after a year of troubled negotiations 
that threatened to result in industrial action over the busy summer period.
It is also braced for a surge in competition on domestic and short-haul routes after the inauguration in January of a 
new terminal at Madrid's Barajas airport. The company said rising fuel costs - up 30 per cent year-on-year to Euros 
600.5m - had forced it to increase surcharges on long-haul flights twice during the nine-month period.
However, reduced in-flight service on domestic and short-haul flights allowed it to contain catering and staff costs, 
after stripping out restructuring charges. This contributed to a slight improvement in efficiency ratios, which helped 
offset a 2 per cent decline in average revenues per passenger kilometre. Occupation ratios edged ahead 1.3 per 
cent to 77.4 per cent.
EUROPE: Asset sales give boost to Iberia
Total passenger revenues were up 5 per cent to Euros 2.69bn, partly reflecting a 3.5 cent increase in volumes. New 
routes helped lift traffic to Africa and the Middle East by 32 per cent, while growth in domestic, European and 
middle-distance traffic averaged 4 per cent.

COVER STORY
Britain's travel agents fly to Marrakech at the end of the month for four days of meetings, workshops and parties. 
Such events in previ us years have been quite jolly although this year's conference is unlikely to be as upbeat as 
usual. This is because the number of travel agents is dwindling. With the agency business model facing increasing 
pressure from the growth of internet travel sites such as Expedia, Lastminute.com and Travelocity, many to ur 
operators are scaling back their investments in high street outlets. 
Indeed, with airlines such as British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair moving to sell a bigger pr oportion of the ir flights 
over the internet , travel agents face the grim prospect of being cut out of the industry altogether. "There has been a 
30 per cent decrease in the number of agents over the last three or four years," says Chris Mottershead, chief 
executive of Travelzest, a company set up to acquire specalist travel businesses . " The number is going to 
continue falling." He points to the rece nt decision by MyTravel, one of Europe's largest tour operators, to close 100 
of its high street outlets. "The internet is the cause of this. More people can create their own holidays (using the 
internet) now and the fastest way to book is by doing it online rather than going to a travel agent." However, others 
say travel agents can prosper by using the internet, particularly if they sell niche products or specialise in areas 
such as business travel.
"The internet can be incredibly useful for traditional travel agencies ," says Dav id Soskin , chief executive of Cheap 
- flights.co.uk. "This is particularly true if they have some speciality in terms of access to a particular part of the 
world or a good relationship with a particular airline." Mr Motter s head agrees , saying tour operators and travel 
agents have to specialise in destinations where customers require a lot of guidance. "They have to specialise in 
taking people to unfamiliar places, like on safari. In other words, places where their customers need support." "If 
you are a specialist for a particular destination then you can advertise that fact and attract new customers. You can 
start to develop that specia list knowledge and you can make money." For many small travel agents, though, the 
internet has already proved a useful marketing tool. "We always featured small independent travel agents on our 
site and they often have super prices because they can get discounts from airlines," says M r S oskin. "T hese ag 
ents offer a very good way for airlines to shift inventory in a low key way." The death of the travel agent has been 
Is this journey's end for the travel agent?  Matthew Garrahan looks at the dwindling number of businesses and 
what they offer
exaggerated, he adds. "The thing that is important to remember is that travel agents don't actually need to haves 
hop premises. A lot of agents will have a call centre and specially trained staff who can sell a cheap flight or a 
higher margin product like car hire. And they can make money. "It is simplistic to say that the internet is destroying 
the travel agency model. Travel agents just have to be wise to it and develop a speciality. They have to use the 
internet properly." Forming close relationships with customers is becoming more important to travel agents under 
pressure from fast growing internet travel sites and more aggressive airlines. David Speakman, managing director 
of Travel Counsellors, which operates a network of people who specialise in particular destinations, says personal 
service is key. "We have found there are a lot of people who are cash rich but time poor - and they want our advice.
" They want expertise , good advice and good service." But for companies that book business travel, agents still 
have an important role to play, says Keith Betton of the Association of British Travel Agents. Agents and s p ecialist 
travel management companies are more suited to planning complex itineraries and r eacting to changing 
schedules, he says. "A traditional good quality travel agent will be excellent at handling business travel," he says. "If 
you book stuff online it's great if you only want to go from A to B. "But a business traveller may want to add on 
extras and adjust the booking. The on line world doesn't l end itself to som e one with a complex booking. "Business 
travel is about booking last minute, without feeling like you are going to have to travel on a budget deal. Most 
people wouldn't mind paying Pounds 100 extra to get the right deal rat her than saving Pounds 100 to sit in a 
lounge for five more hours." Rondi Leo, American Express head of busin ess travel for Europe, Middle East and 
Africa, agrees that business travellers have complex needs. "The challenge for travellers is to find new ways to 
improve product ivit y, while businesses need to recognise that this fundamental shift is taking place and allow their 
staff to be flexible in buil ding a n itinerary around their personal and work preferences." But while bigger agents 
and travel management compan ies such as American Express have the capacity to respond to more complicated 
booking needs, smaller agents may suffer . This seems to be borne out by the decline in the number of registered 
travel agents. Five years ago there were 1,820 companies register ed with the Association of British Travel Agents. 
T hese companies had an additional 5,234 outlets in the UK. However, by 2005 this had fallen to 1,397 companies 
with 4,727 outlets. H owever , while the number of agents has fallen, Sean Tipton, of the Association o f British 
Travel Agents , says those that remain are expanding rapidly, with average turnover rising from œ7.9m in 2001 to 
œ9.1m this year. Challenges remain . But there may be life in travel agents yet.

European equities scaled a five-week high this week as a strong earnings season offset the impact of French riots 
and lacklustre US markets.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rallied 1 per cent yesterday to close up 17.15 points, or 1.4 per cent to 1,238.13 over 
the week. Germany's Xetra Dax index outperformed, rising 1.9 per cent over the week to 5,090.75 as Germany's 
politicians sealed agreement on a coalition government.
Financial stocks powered gains, with Italy's UniCredito the latest bank to report sparkling third-quarter results. Its 
shares rose 4.7 per cent to a three-year high of Euros 5.21 over the week.
Strong third-quarter earnings also propelled Germany's HVB up 5.1 per cent to Euros 26.03 over the week and 
Bank Austria up 4.4 per cent to Euros 103. Both are being taken over by UniCredito.
After losses from US hurricanes and weakness in its banking unit, German in-surer Allianz fell 0.9 per cent to Euros 
119.70 yesterday but ended the week up 0.3 per cent. Dutch rival ING rose 9.1 per cent over the week to Euros 
26.83 after reporting 21 per cent rise in third-quarter net profit on Thursday.
Shares in Telefonica struggled in spite of the Spanish telecommunications group reporting yesterday a better-than-
expected 36.2 per cent rise in nine-month net profit. The shares fell 0.6 per cent over the week to Euros 12.66 as 
investors questioned the strategy behind its bid for UK operator O.
Deutsche Telekom fell 1.9 per cent to Euros 14.65 after announcing plans to spend Euros 1.2bn on marketing and 
product development in 2006.
TDC slipped 0.6 per cent to DKr355 after a private equity fund considering a takeover was given more time to 
inspect the Danish telecoms operator's finances.
Takeover speculation elsewhere sent Serono, the Swiss biotech company, soaring 12.8 per cent to SFr954.50 and 
Dutch logistics company TNT up 9.8 per cent to Euros 22.09.
Strong earnings offset problems in France EUROPE
It was a mixed week for carmakers, aided by a weak euro but hit by downbeat ratings from UBS as it resumed 
sectoral coverage.
DaimlerChrysler took the lead, gaining 2.5 per cent to Euros 42.65 as analysts welcomed its decision to sell its 
stake in Mitsubishi Motors.
In airlines, Lufthansa dropped 1 per cent to Euros 11.54 after issuing an upgrade of its full-year outlook that fell 
short of hopes.
Ryanair fell 3.1 per cent on Monday on giving a cautious outlook for the winter season. But yesterday it announced 
plans to expand its Frankfurt base with Dollars 1bn worth of new planes and investment in a new terminal, and 
shares closed down just 0.4 per cent to Euros 6.97 over the week.
Alitalia fell 0.1 per cent to Euros 5.47 on Friday when its shares resumed trading after the Italian government, its 
main shareholder, said it would raise cash through a Euros 1bn rights issue.
Oil stocks were hit by an easing of crude prices. The sector fell 2.9 per cent, with Total dropping 4.1 per cent to 
Euros 208.20, and Spain's Repsol down 2.6 per cent to Euros 24.74.

EasyJet founder ponders poker for cruise ship

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, the low-cost airline, may introduce poker to his EasyCruise ship to cover 
costs as it crosses the Atlantic to its winter home in the Caribbean.
As he travelled to Barbados this weekend to launch the low-budget, orange-coloured cruise ship in the Americas, 
Mr Haji-Ioannou was considering how to make the ship's transatlantic crossing "sellable".
During the summer, EasyCruiseOne, as it is called, travels the French and Italian Rivieras.
"I've thought about a poker element," he said in an interview. "Cruise ships have always carried casinos."
But he said he was nervous about linking the Easy brand - which is attached to 15 businesses within his EasyGroup 
holding company - to gambling. "I'd subcontract it to a poker company," he said.
Mr Haji-Ioannou was speaking this week on the 10th anniversary of the launch of EasyJet. Bid rumours are swirling 
around the airline following the acquisition of 16.2 per cent of its shares by FL Group, owner of Icelandair.
He said he had no need to sell his 16.6 per cent EasyJet stake, though he would be interested at the right price 
provided the buyers did not jeopardise the Easy brand name.
His goal for the next five years would be preparing EasyGroup, with 15 different businesses from car rental to male 
grooming products, for flotation, he said.
Mr Haji-Ioannou is one of the pioneers of low-cost travel, but he is not the first to see opportunity in the gambling 
market.
His arch-rival, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said this month he intends to offer in-flight gambling as a 
possible way to subsidise free seats. He has already introduced the sale of scratch cards, which have helped boost 
ancillary revenues.

Mr Haji-Ioannou dismissed suggestions that he would create an "EasyPoker" brand to add to his collection. But he 
does own the domain name EasyAtlantic in case it is ever needed. Easy as you go, Page 17

On a drizzly morning this week, Stelios Haji-Ioannou stood at a London bus stop, waiting for an EasyBus to take 
him to Luton airport.
At Pounds 3, the cost of thejourney was less than the Starbucks coffee and pain au chocolat that a passenger was 
clutching.
Exactly 10 years before, when it was also "pissing with rain", Stelios recalls waiting in a seedy terminal at Luton 
airport to take the maiden EasyJet flight to Glasgow.
At the time, he advertised the flight as costing as little as "a pair of jeans". The two women who checked in the 
passengers that day are still employed by EasyJet with share options that could mean they never have to work 
again.
At the time, Stelios says his ambition was short term - "survival". But in the years since, EasyJet - along with rival 
Ryanair and other low-cost carriers - has transformed air travel in Europe and the lifestyles of many of the 
Continent's citizens.
Like 38-year-old Stelios, who flies EasyJet to Nice each Friday on his way home to Monaco, North Europeans who 
work in the rain can now weekend in the Mediterranean sun.
Passengers can buy tickets online, no longer needing travel agents. Cheap travel has improved familiarity among 
Europeans, Stelios believes, forging friendships and even marriages.
Yet this son of a Greek- Cypriot shipping tycoon appears to have changed little since, as a preppy 28-year-old, he 
spent a year in Luton to ensure EasyJet's successful launch.
It's easy as you go for EasyJet 's entrepreneur Henry Tricks take a bus ride with Stelios Haji-Ioannou and 
listens to his views and hopes for the future of his ....
On Thursday, he boarded the cramped EasyBus minibus for the 45-minute journey to Luton, fighting with the 
seatbelt that squeezed against his robust frame.
There were only half a dozen passengers paying Pounds 3 each, which would barely have paid for the petrol. But 
he talked enthusiastically of his plans to franchise the EasyBus brand to coach operators around Europe.
The next day he was due to fly to the Caribbean to launch his EasyCruise, building the Easy brand in the Americas.
His mind was also working overtime on how to make the transatlantic crossing profitable for the orange-liveried 
cruise ship. Perhaps he would offer poker on crossings, he said - though he openly wondered whether association 
with gambling could tarnish his brand.
With a youthful sense of principle, he was even choosy about who would fly him across the Atlantic.
He still prefers not to fly British Airways, with whom he has publicly battled for years - partly, he admits, as an 
attention-grabbing exercise. Instead, he flew Virgin Atlantic, owned by his role model and friend, Sir Richard 
Branson.
Stelios, who describes himself on his business card as a "serial entrepreneur", has an articulate, if restless, way of 
talking. His business affairs are similarly fast-paced.
In EasyJet's early years, he paid such close attention to the airline that, when snow grounded its flights at Luton, he 
would travel there to cheer up passengers. But once it had moved out of survival mode with its flotation in 2000, he 
focused on bringing brand building and "yield management" - his two specialisations - to the rest of his Easy 
empire.
With his eye on the potential of the internet, he acquired several thousand internet domain names, even wayward 
ones such as EasyAtlantic. These, he believes, could be businesses of the future - though he remains dubious 
about no-frills transatlantic travel.
His career, which began with his father in shipping, has been anything but plain- sailing. Several of his EasyGroup 
businesses, such as EasyInternetcafe and EasyCar, the car rental company, had teething problems - he admits he 
rolled out internet cafes far too quickly and has had to bail some ventures out with his own money.
Some are still tiny despite much nurturing, including Milton Keynes-based Easy-Pizza (favourite pizza, "El Stel") 
and EasyBus, which he once expected to rival national companies.
But while he says EasyGroup has recently become cash flow positive thanks to licenses and franchises, including 
EasyJet's license payment for the use of the brand, he appears to thrive on adversity.
"I get bored when things go well and move on,"Stelios says.
Now is no time for Stelios to be bored. In 2002, he stepped back from EasyJet to focus on EasyCinemas and to 
bring the internet cafes back from the brink, appointing Sir Colin Chandler as replacement chairman of EasyJet. In 
2004, he sold 4m shares in EasyJet at 370p to 380p to fund the cruise ship, a budget hotel and the buses.
But he remained an insider to the airline's affairs, with a board representative, and was horrified to see the impact 
on EasyJet shares from two profit warnings in rapid succession.
His insider status frustrated his efforts to buy the ailing shares last year.
Then, in October 2004, he was shocked to find an Icelandic airline company, FL Group, climbing up the EasyJet 
share register, having bought shares as cheap as 120p.
Led by Hannes Smarason, who has also bought Copenhagen-based Sterling Airways, Europe's fourth-largest low-
cost airline, FL Group's interest in EasyJet has triggered bid speculation.
It's easy as you go for EasyJet 's entrepreneur Henry Tricks take a bus ride with Stelios Haji-Ioannou and 
listens to his views and hopes for the future of his ....
Last month, its stake increased to 16.2 per cent, just shy of Stelios' own 16.6 per cent (though his brother and sister 
own 12 per cent each). The shares are back above 300p.
For once, Stelios appears to have found in Mr Smarason a businessman as impetuous as he is. It leaves him 
sounding a bit flat-footed, even if he has already retaken a seat on the board to keep a close eye on affairs. "I have 
to congratulate them on their timing," he says of the Icelanders. "But I have not studied the FL Group enough to 
form a view on whether they would be good custodians of the (EasyJet) name."
He insists there is no reason to sell out of EasyJet - except that he mentions that the last time he sold shares was at 
370p to 380p, which indicates he may have a price. What particularly troubles him is who he would sell the 
business to, lest the brand becomes debased.
He will not speculate on where he expects to be in 10 years, saying the time horizon is too long.
But over the next five years, he says making a success out of ownership of the Easy brand will be his "main job". 
Eventually, this will mean floating it.
There is no hurry, he says. As he clambers down from the EasyBus, he notes that he is still a young man and the 
only succession planning he would need to do was if he "fell under a bus".
So at the bus terminal, he looks carefully to right and left, and then greets some of his EasyBus passengers as 
television cameras roll.
He wishes them a good flight on EasyJet and then finds, to his embarrassment, they are flying Ryanair.
Ever the showman, he laughs uproariously.

Ryanair Holdings PLC will triple the number of planes it uses to fly in and out of Hahn Airport, the company's chief 
executive said Friday.
Speaking in Mainz, which is near Frankfurt and the Hahn Airport, CEO Michael O'Leary said the Dublin-based 
airline would spend $1US billion (euro850 million) to increase the number of planes it uses to fly in and out of the 
airport from six to 18 by 2012.
In addition, the company will take a 50 percent share in the financing of a new terminal building in the form of a 
loan.
"Thanks to the agreement with Ryanair, a total of around 10,000 jobs directly at the airport are forecast by 2012. 
This opens up job opportunities for the whole state," said Kurt Beck, governor of Rhineland-Palatinate state, where 
the airport is located. Currently, the airport employs some 2,400 workers.
The airport, located 110 kilometers (68 miles) east of Frankfurt, is spending some euro100 million ($117US.6 
million) to expand its terminal and operations. Some 3.8 million passengers are forecast to fly in and out of the 
airport this year.
Ryanair is Europe's biggest low-fare airline, flying some 35 million passengers annually on 267 routes in 21 
European countries. The airline, founded in 1985, has more than 100 Boeing 737-800s and orders for another 125 
planes for delivery through 2012.

A sharp fall in Grafton and weakness in other constructions shares weighed on the Dublin market in early trade this 
morning.
At 10.20am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 10.96 points to 6732.83.
Grafton shares were the worst hit this morning after UK peer Travis Perkins indicated that while trading in the first 
four months of H2 has been broadly in line with expectations, 'market conditions and lead indicators have worsened 
significantly from mid-October'. Grafton shares were down 52c to 821.
 Other construction stocks were also weak. CRH was down by 17c to 2178, as the latest figures from the 
Department of Trade & Industry show that UK brick deliveries declined by around12pc (yoy) in September. 
Kingspan was down 8c to 1010. There was bad news for housebuilder Abbey as figures from the Office of the 
Deputy Prime Minister show that housing starts in England fell by 1pc in Q3 while completions were down 5pc. 
Abbey shares were down 8c to 902. On the upside, Ryanair share gains helped to minimise ISEQ losses, rising 10c 
to 707 after it announced it is to spend USD1bn on new aircraft to be based at Frankfurt's Hahn airport.

A late climb in Elan shares also lent support.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down up 42.05 points to 6785.84.

Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, is to spend USD1bn on new aircraft to be based at Frankfurt's Hahn airport - an 
investment that Dublin has lost out on due to Government policy, it said.
Ryanair said it will base 18 aircraft, operate over 50 routes, carry 8 million passengers p.a. and sustain over 8,000 
jobs at Frankfurt Hahn.
The airline said that all of this investment has now been lost to Ireland because of the Government's failure to 
deliver on a second competing terminal at Dublin airport.
 The Ryanair statement said Frankfurt Hahn airport will now benefit from the USD1bn aircraft investment, while 
Ireland loses out on 8,000 jobs, over 50 routes and eight million passengers per annum.

Body
Low-cost airline, Ryanair, today applied to the Supreme Court in a bid to prevent the Labour Court from hearing 
complaints by pilots against the airline.
Last month, the airline lost its bid to prevent an investigation of complaints by pilots about conditions at the airline.
Ryanair had challenged the Labour Court's right to hear the pilots' complaints represented by their union IALPA, but 
their challenge was rejected by the High Court.
 Ryanair is seeking a stay of that Labour Court hearing pending a full appeal of the High Court judgment, which they 
lost on every point. The company was effectively challenging new Industrial Relations Legislation, which they claim 
introduces compulsory union recognition by the backdoor. Ryanair's counsel Martin Hayden told the Supreme Court 
that it would be unfair to the airline for the Labour Court hearing to proceed before its appeal was complete, 
according to RTE News.

Of all those to have crossed the Rubicon – the river no Roman general could traverse without signalling imminent 
military threat – the arrival of the low-cost carrier represents one of the most fearless assaults ever mounted on 
Italian commercial aviation.
At a time when national carrier Alitalia’s troubles seem unremitting, foreign low-cost competition has declared itself 
irrevocably committed to a campaign to dominate the Italian air travel landscape.
Alitalia – burdened with staggering net debts of €1.8 billion ($2.18 billion) and €2.4 billion worth of accumulated net 
losses – has meanwhile managed to buy a little time and remain airborne thanks to a European Commission-
sanctioned rescue that granted the carrier access to a state-guaranteed €400 million bridging loan.
Repayment of that loan is, however, due in March and, with an additional €168 million of debt falling due over the 
next year, Alitalia may find its €1.2 billion recapitalisation plan lacking obvious and immediate appeal to potential 
financial backers.
Alitalia’s woes have heralded not so much a retreat from the low-cost battlefield, rather an acute inertia preventing 
the carrier from addressing the air-travel revolution in which foreign insurgents risk creating an ever-worsening 
breach in the national airline industry’s defences.
This vacuum has been swiftly filled by Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair which, after entering the Italian market in May 
1998 with services to Pisa and Treviso near Venice, now serves 15 airports, including a strategic regional spread of 
bases at Milan Bergamo, Rome Ciampino and Pisa. In 2005, Ryanair expects to carry 10 million passengers on 66 
Italian routes, double the 5 million passengers it carried only two years ago.
Peter Sherrard, Ryanair’s communications chief, says Alitalia needs to get its house in order as any vestige of 
allegiance to the national flag carrier by the average Italian citizen is swiftly disappearing. “There’s a huge demand 
for low-fare travel within Italy, which has often wrongly been considered merely as a destination rather than an 
outbound market. Our Rome figures have shown there is a huge appetite for outbound travel and if you consider 
Low cost? invasion
that we launched our Milan base with six destinations and now have Alghero – which is not a base – launched with 
an initial five, you can see that the market has certainly developed.”
UK low-cost rival EasyJet is also eyeing significant growth in Italy after recently unveiling Milan’s Malpensa as its 
first base airport in the country, from where it will operate new services to Athens, London, Madrid, Malaga 
and Paris from March.
Philippe Vignon, EasyJet’s country manager for Italy, says Malpensa – from where it expects to carry 1.2 million 
passengers in its first 12 months – represents a move to establish an enduring brand identity in Italy, a flag behind 
which EasyJet can rally the Italian citizenry and achieve a swift maturity rate on the back of a growing clamour for 
low-fare mobility.
“Between 2004 and 2005, we saw a 92% growth rate in Italy and we doubled the number of flights,” says Vignon, 
who says that such a continued rapid rate of growth would make it “quite tough for other more established airlines 
to have a significant effect on our business”.
He adds: “The Italian market is much more fragmented – unlike, say, Germany, which early on saw a marked 
concentration process of low-cost carriers – and it has even greater potential due to the lack of any real strong 
national player.”
Alberto Denzler, chief executive of Air Blu and a veteran of Italian air transport, believes it is the foreign low-cost 
carrier that stands to profit from the geographical advantages of the north-south geo-operational axis that Italy 
offers.
“Italy was made for foreign airlines. Its long peninsula offers very good direct service possibilities and, arguably, it is 
easier to operate direct services from London airports than, say, Alitalia routeing services through Milan. I know that 
Italians can run a low-cost carrier, but they just can’t do it from a high cost base, which most of them are attempting 
to do.”
ABN-AMRO financial analyst Andrew Lobbenberg believes further victories in low-cost territory are assured as Italy 
remain “a decentralised country with meaningful cities and with potentially even further meaningful traffic generation 
to be had” with, additionally, a naturally strong market between the islands.
“There remains a great deal of potential in terms of the Italian domestic market and in certain other inbound 
markets. Although Tuscany and Venice are relatively developed, Naples is not and there’s not much capacity on the 
island routes to northern Europe either,” says Lobbenberg.
Ryanair spied this potential stronghold in domestic route services earlier this year – a move which importantly helps 
improve the carrier’s aircraft utilisation – with 10 new daily services from its Ciampino base to Alghero, Venice and 
Verona.
The dynamism of the foreign low-cost carrier should not, however, detract from some valiant attempts to establish 
home-grown champions.
Air One – celebrating its tenth anniversary this month – broke into the market with its inaugural Rome-Milan service 
in November 1995, introducing competition onto what was then the fifth densest route in Europe and the most 
densely travelled monopoly route in the western world.
Rome-based Air One provides its typical client – the high-frequency business traveller on one hour domestic flights 
– with high frequency services from preferred and, therefore, more expensive airports such as Rome Fiumicino and 
Milan Linate, operating 1,400 flights per week with a fleet of 30 Boeing 737s. Frequency is linked strictly to demand 
and in the frenetic case of the Rome-Milan route, Air One operates an impressive 18 daily return flights.
“Air One has the will to compete running through its DNA. It has recorded a profit in each of the last three years, the 
result of strict cost control and high productivity combined with a solid network of frequent service on all the major 
business travel routes in Italy,” says Giorgio De Roni, Air One’s director of planning, network and marketing. He 
Low cost? invasion
says low cost carriers may well have established a significant presence on intra-European routes to and from Italy, 
but many seem to have passed over domestic route development, an arena in which Air One carried almost six 
million passengers in 2004 across 22 Italian airports.
“Passengers are very willing to pay a “reasonable” premium for the benefits these services provide. Our additional 
costs are to provide for additional service, not to carry the fat of an inefficient organisation. The important thing is to 
be as efficient as low cost carriers,” says De Roni.
The spectacular rise and even more spectacular fall last year of cash-stricken budget airline Volareweb – amid low 
rumours of high political intrigue – may have dampened the enthusiasm of the aircraft leasing and banking fraternity 
to back Italian airlines. One industry source confides that Volare’s downfall was essentially due to the airline’s “high-
cost, low-fare” commercial reality: “For reasons best known to itself, the carrier went on routes it should never have 
flown. It was happily flying into Rome Fiumicino and Venice – whereas it should have gone to the likes of the 
cheaper Ciampino and Treviso.”
Nevertheless, the airline enjoyed a renaissance of sorts – albeit as a shadow of its former self – when it relaunched 
domestic operations in June while under the administrative aegis of government-appointed Carlo Rinaldini. Today, 
Volare is for sale with perhaps its most attractive asset on offer being its valuable suite of Milan Linate slots.
Italian low-cost start-up carrier Myair also launched late last year with a business plan based on growing the budget 
market and exploiting the troubles of beleaguered Volare and Alitalia by seizing market share. Sicily’s Windjet (see 
box) also has a unique take on the traditional low-cost model by running scheduled domestic and charter flights 
between northern and southern Italy alongside each other.
Wolfgang Kurth, chief executive of Italian start-up Blu-express.com, points out, however, that both Myair and 
WindJet remain minor players with relatively high unit costs. He also acknowledges that Blu-express.com is being 
established to offset the potential risk to parent leisure airline Blue Panorama Airlines from any future moves by tour 
operators to cut capacity.
Kurth says it aims to invest €12 million in the operation and carry 800,000 passengers in its first year, operating two 
Boeings 737-400s that are to be returned to the leisure airline’s fleet next summer and replaced with three 
dedicated 737-300s. “We are making minor changes that give the impression of Blu-express.com being a different 
airline,” admits Kurth, who says the judicious application of sticky tape to the aircraft exterior seems sufficient to 
differentiate it from the parent airline livery.
The former Hapag Lloyd Express chief believes the low-cost industry is still in change mode and that many current 
carriers will migrate to become hybrids with elements of their full service counterparts alongside the “hardcore” low-
cost torch bearers such as Ryanair.
Lobbenberg adds that Kurth’s vision of a low-cost diversity of offerings will doubtless be accompanied by the 
systematic urge to merge. “Just as we are seeing in Scandinavia, with the proliferation of a lot of start-up low-cost 
carriers – most of which are not making much profit – the time will come when their Italian counterparts are ripe for 
consolidation,” he says.
Lobbenberg is quick to point out that corporate activity in la Bella Italia exhibits many of the hellish idiosyncrasies of 
Dante’s Inferno: “With Italy you should never forget that it is an intensely political environment and it’s a classic case 
of not what you know, but who you know.” -

Gains on Wall Street and talk of further merger and acquisition activity boosted European equities yesterday as 
takeover rumours swirled around the utilities sector.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index built on last week's 4 per cent gain, up 5.21 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 1,226.19.
French investors were more subdued after an 11th night of rioting in Paris. The CAC 40 underperformed, up 0.1 per 
cent to 4,503.65.
Eon, Germany's biggest listed utility company, was up 0.5 per cent to Euros 75.89 as expectations strengthened 
that it might make a bid for ScottishPower.
"We maintain our view that a price up to 625p would be acceptable for Eon to pay," said Ian Mitchell, an analyst at 
JPMorgan.
RWE, the German utilities company, jumped 1.7 per cent to Euros 57.21, propelled by Friday evening's 
announcement that it would sell its UK and US water businesses, Thames Water and American Water Works in 
separate deals that could bring in as much as Euros 15bn.
Elsewhere in the sector, France's Veolia Environnement gained 1 per cent to Euros 35.31 after meeting 
expectations with a 17.3 per cent rise in nine-month operating profit and confirming its full-year targets.
Munich Re, Europe's largest reinsurer, added 0.8 per cent to Euros 103.55 on third quarter results that showed 
one-off gains from investments outweighed its losses from US hurricane damage. Munich Re reported third quarter 
net profit before minorities up by a third to Euros 513m and said its full-year target was still within reach.
HeidelbergCement gained 1.9 per cent to Euros 67.36 as CSFB raised its price target to Euros 60 from Euros 55 
ahead of the German cement company's third quarter results on Wednesday.
Analysts expected the company to report a 32 per cent rise in third quarter net profit, driven by high demand and 
prices in key US and Indonesian markets.
 Eurofirst maintains winning run EUROPE
Ryanair was one of the day's sharpest fallers, sliding 3.1 per cent to Euros 6.78 after it accompanied forecast-
beating third quarter results with a cautious outlook for the winter season. The Irish company, whose shares have 
surged 40 per cent over the last year, maintained its forecast for a 10 per cent rise in full-year net profit, adjusted for 
one-off items.
In contrast, Lufthansa, which analysts expected to raise its full-year guidance when it reports quarterly earnings on 
Thursday, gained 1.5 per cent to Euros 11.83. Air France-KLM rose 1.6 per cent to Euros 14.39 after saying 
passenger numbers had risen 8.9 per cent in October.
In pharmaceuticals, Celesio slid 3.4 per cent to Euros 69.34 having been downgraded by Deutsche to "hold" from 
"buy" with a Euros 2 lower price target of Euros 72.
Novo Nordisk gained 2.4 per cent to DKr336 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the world's leading insulin maker to 
"buy" from "hold".

Ryanair passengers will soon be able to gamble on their BlackBerries during flights. Unlike its customers, though, 
the Irish carrier seems unlikely to lose money. Growth in revenues from "extras" such as car hire continued to 
outstrip even the 33 per cent rise in total turnover in the first half.
Prospects look good. Although operating margins fell a 10th to 30 per cent, they are still the envy of airlines like 
British Airways, which is struggling to achieve 10 per cent margins. Ryanair's cost control measures, while enviable, 
are not rocket science. Some are relatively small scale. It does much of its marketing via the internet. It has 
introduced bigger aircraft which do not need more people to run them. The main difference, though, with BA and 
others is staff expenses. At BA, these are a third of costs; at Ryanair, a mere 13 per cent.
Staff costs should remain low, but other expenses will be difficult to keep down. Although 90 per cent hedged at 
Dollars 49 a barrel to March 2006, the fuel bill will head higher. Airport and handling charges - 17 per cent of the 
total - will continue to rise. Finally, Ryanair's guaranteed 12.5 per cent tax rate will expire, if not until 2012.
Although the intense competition in the industry could spring surprises, Ryanair looks set for profitable expansion. 
Its shares are up 40 per cent over the last year. This may have to satisfy shareholders. Apart from gambling wins, 
they are unlikely to see much of the cash generated from Ryanair's fantastic growth handed back to them.

Michael O'Leary appears to be running out of challenges.
He has long since made Ryanair the world's most profitable airline, and yesterday he announced that he expected 
to retire "in three to four years time".
In five years time the Irish low-cost carrier, which he has led since 1994 as chief executive, would have doubled in 
size to 70m passengers, he said yesterday, eclipsing all of its short-haul rivals in Europe including Air France-KLM, 
Lufthansa and British Airways.
The aircraft to support the expansion have all been ordered and the delivery schedule is in place with Boeing, to 
take the fleet from 107 aircraft in March 2006 to at least 234 by March 2012.
As he announced another set of record profits, Mr O'Leary outlined the latest phase of his low-cost airline revolution 
to help keep him occupied for the next couple of years.
Ryanair's take on the low-cost airline business model and its ruthless pursuit of cost savings is well established, but 
now Mr O'Leary is going all out to increase what the airline earns under the unglamorous heading of "ancillary 
revenues".
That category already accounts for 14 per cent of Ryanair turnover. But Mr O'Leary said yesterday the share should 
be up toabout 20 per cent within five years.
Ancillary revenues rose by 40 per cent in the first half to the end of September, covering everything from strong 
growth in onboard sales, including gambling, with the sale of scratch cards, to insurance, and hotel and car rental 
bookings taken through the airline's website.
More expansion and new revenues are Ryanair 's challenges Kevin Done looks at what Michael O'Leary is 
planning to do before he retires in three or four years ti....
The promotion of inflight gambling is one of Mr O'Leary's favourite schemes for future earnings. His experiment with 
inflight entertainment delivered through portable electronic devices playing blockbuster movies to cartoons came 
unstuck through lack of demand, but while that was failing the airline was discovering a new earnings ploy through 
the sale of scratchcards.
Mr O'Leary said yesterday that he believed onboard gambling and electronic games playing could be the next 
wave.
That would possibly be allied with the technology and earnings that will become available when the inflight use of 
mobile phones is approved.
Advertising is another revenue source of growing importance - six Ryanair aircraft have already been repainted as 
flying billboards in the colours of companies such as Hertz and Cable and Wireless.
Airports too are well in Mr O'Leary's sights. Ryanair plans to act as middleman bringing together developers of low-
cost hotels with airport sites. It will guarantee a certain number of hotel visitors and it will take a commission. The 
first such deal should be completed in a few weeks.
Back in its core activity of flying passengers around Europe there will also be little let up in the Ryanair expansion 
scheme.
The airline already has an unrivalled spread of operations around Europe with 15 bases.
The total, however, is expected to rise to about 30 as Ryanair climbs to 70m passengers.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier and the world's most profitable airline, announced record first-half profits 
yesterday and said it planned to double profits and passengers by 2012.
The strength of the Irish carrier's results served to highlight the woes of carriers around the world from Alitalia in 
Europe to Japan Airlines in Asia and Independence Air of the US, which are struggling with high oil prices, 
mismanagement and fierce low-cost competition.
Alitalia, Italy's struggling majority state-owned carrier, said that it would issue as much as Euros 1.2bn (Pounds 
810m) in new shares later this year in a sale backed by Banca Intesa, Italy's largest bank, as the airline fights to 
stave off collapse. It announced a small net profit of Euros 5.5m in its third quarter, seasonally the year's strongest 
quarter, against a loss of Euros 46.4m a year ago.
Japan Airlines (JAL) is set to slash the base salary of all employees by 10 per cent in a move aimed at restoring 
Asia's leading carrier to profitability.
In the US, the parent of Washington-based Independence Air yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection and put itself 
up for sale as it faces continuing losses and dwindling cash resources, abandoning its attempt to re-launch itself as 
a low-fare carrier
Ryanair was cautious about its prospects this winter, and forecast a 5 to 10 per cent fall in average fares in its final 
quarter from January to March. It left unchanged its full-year profit guidance for an increase of 10 per cent in 
underlying net profits, excluding exceptional items.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said: "This winter we expect that there will be continued intense 
competition and there will be fewer low-fare carriers in the market, as higher fuel prices force more carriers out of 
the industry."
Ryanair's fuel bill - now 36 per cent of total operating costs - more than doubled in the six months to September.
Ryanair soars as ailing Alitalia plans new shares
Ryanair increased its pre-tax profits for the first half by 22 per cent from Euros 221.5m to Euros 269.5m.
Turnover rose by 33 per cent to Euros 946m, as passengers rose by 29 per cent to 18m. In the second quarter, pre-
tax profits rose by 18 per cent from Euros 163.3m to Euros 192.6m.
The airline achieved an un-rivalled 25.6 per cent net margin in the first six months and a 31.9 per cent net margin in 
the second quarter, seasonally its most profitable period of the year. Lex, Page 20 Mudlark, Page 24 Ryanair even

Four weeks into fatherhood and Michael O'Leary is thinking of giving up the leadership of Ryanair, where he has 
been chief executive since 1994.
O'Leary, 44, says he expects to go in "three to four years time". He has already built the world's most profitable 
airline, but when it becomes the undisputed industry leader in Europe it will need a new kind of boss. "We will have 
to move from being aggressive, entrepreneurial and in your face and will have to have a different relationship with 
those gobshites in the European Commission. That will need someone other than me.
"The airline will have to be more professional in the way it approaches governments and more sensitive to those 
environmental whingers and goon platoons, and that certainly won't be me," he said.
Heading the runners and riders to replace O'Leary will be the two deputy chief executives, Michael Cawley, who 
doubles as chief operating officer and Howard Millar, who is also chief financial officer. However, O'Leary said 
yesterday he would expect the board also to look for candidates outside the company. "There is not a natural 
successor," he said modestly.

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC reported better than expected profits Monday on the back of increased 
passenger numbers that helped offset rising fuel costs.
For the three months ending Sept. 30, net profit rose 17 percent to euro172.5 million (US$203.8 million) from 
euro148.1 million a year earlier, as sales increased 32 percent to euro541.5 million (US$639.8 million).
The net profit figure was just ahead of the euro171 million (US$202 million) analysts had expected.
"These record traffic and profits reflect the continued successful rollout of Ryanair's lowest fare model despite 
difficult trading conditions characterized by record-high fuel prices and intense competition," Ryanair Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said.
O'Leary said yields from fares were up 3 percent, despite a 29 percent increase in seat capacity.
Quarterly figures were also boosted by increased volumes of passengers on existing routes and the launch of new 
bases at Luton, north of London, at Liverpool and at Shannon, on Ireland's west coast.
Ryanair carried a total of 9.5 million passengers in the quarter, up 28 percent from a year earlier, and is expecting 
to transport over 35 million passengers this fiscal year.
During the quarter, Ryanair's fuel and oil bill rose sharply to euro127 million (US$150 million), from euro62 million a 
year earlier.
The company, Europe's largest budget carrier by passenger numbers, said it expected full-year profit to rise about 
10 percent to just over euro300 million (US$354.4 million).
Ryanair shares fell 2.3 percent to euro6.82 (US$8.06).

Severn Trent shares were in demand as the water utility shrugged off last weeks referral by the Office of Fair 
Trading to the Serious Fraud Office, which is looking at alleged accounting irregularities in its financial reporting to 
Ofwat between 2000 and 2003.
The shares rose 23p to 988p in thin trading with less than 1.1 million going though the ticker by lunchtime in 722 
trades.
Moving up behind it on the FTSE 100 leader board were Reed Elsevier, 11.5p better at 543p, Friends Provident, up 
3.5p to 183.75p, and Pearson, 10.5p better 654p.
The FTSE 100 went higher largely because of bid speculation, however. It went sharply better after opening, but 
drifted down to a low of 5,415.5 at 10.50 before climbing steadily to reach 5,441.1 by 1pm, up 17.6 points. Volume 
was light with 413 million shares changing hands in 44,617 deals.
Government figures showed that manufacturing output dropped in September, falling 0.3% from August. There had 
been hopes of a 0.5% rise. Industrial production was 0.5% up in September from August, below the forecast 0.7%.
Neither movement was sufficiently dramatic to change the markets view on Thursdays Bank of England interest 
rates decision, which is expected to remain unchanged at 4.5%. The main concern remains the above-target 
inflation figure and the effect it might have on economic growth.
Mining shares were a weak spot with Xstrata top of the loser board with a 25p fall to £12.81. Following it down were 
Antofagasta, 12p lower at £14.68, and Anglo American, down 6p to £16.74.
In volume terms O2, up 0.125 to 196.875p, was the busiest stock of the morning with 122 million shares changing 
hands. It was followed, after SG Securities buy recommendation, by Vodafone, up 1.875p to 150.625p with 56 
million. Then came Royal & Sun Alliance, up 1.625p to 106.625p with 13.8 million, and BP, down 0.75p to 637.25p 
with 16.2 million.
A cautious view of the future by Ryanair boss Michael OLeary hit the share price after publication of the Irish groups 
interim figures, down 0.17 to 6.81.
Suggestions that Carillion was looking at a bid for Mowlem helped the target add 5.375p to 187.875p and the 
possible predator 2.875p to 278.875p. Teather & Greenwood rates Carillion a buy.
Monday Lunchtime Market: Severn Trent shrugs off fraud probe
Some prices moved on broker recommendations. Legal & General is 1.125p higher at 111.875p, after being 
upgraded to outperform by Bear Stearns.
On the back of an anticipated recovery in Europe, UBS upgrades Aggreko from reduce to neutral and the shares 
added 3p to 251.25p.
Teathers rates Marks & Spencer a buy, but the shares slipped 3p ahead of results due on Tuesday before 
recovering to 434p, up 1p. Citygroups downgrade of RHM from buy to hold helped the shares lose 5.125p to 
265.875p.
Shares in the media group GCAP slipped 17p to 334p after reports that the CVC private equity group had shelved 
plans for a bid.
The atmosphere was rather better than it had been on Wall Street last week, but with the lack of government 
statistics this week its likely to take its lead from the movement in the oil price currently hovering around $60 a 
barrel. The Dow Jones index is expected to slip around five points after opening.
In mainland Europe, Amsterdam share prices were little changed. In Frankfurt the DAX 30 index was 4.67 points or 
0.09% lower at 4,990.57. Sentiment in Paris was depressed by the prevailing atmosphere of social unrest and the 
governments apparent inability to get on top of it. CAC-40 is down 17.99 points (0.40%) at 4,480.71 in light trading.

Ryanair flies over doubled fuel charges
Ryanair flies over doubled fuel charges

Body
Although fuel costs more than doubled at Europes number one budget airline Ryanair, boss Michael OLeary 
remains convinced that the development of low air fares in Europe is still in the early stages and is confident of 
doubling passenger volumes and profits by 2012. Fuel was 36% of Ryanairs operating costs against 24% a year 
ago as the total hit 237 million (£160 million) in the six months to 30 September. The bill was partially offset by the 
strengthening of the euro against the US dollar.
Ryanair (73KH) was unhedged for most the period. It is 90% hedged at $49 a barrel for the remainder of the year, 
but unhedged thereafter. OLeary expects prices to continue at these levels for some time.
Not only does he reject surcharges, but also he says they allow Ryanair to gain at the expense of its competitors 
which is why he has proved yet again that he can deliver record profit and passenger growth during turbulent 
trading periods when others are losing money.
He says despite a 29% increase in seat capacity, yields are 3% higher, which is a reflection of the multiple fuel 
surcharges imposed by European flag carriers, which have continued to widen the gap between their fares and 
Ryanair's.
O'Leary said: We have again reaffirmed our commitment not to impose fuel surcharges on our passengers and 
reaped the benefits of this strategy in terms of significant traffic growth and slightly higher yields during the half 
year.'
OLeary highlighted August, when Ryanairs short haul European network carried more passengers than British 
Airways did on all routes worldwide.
Total operating revenues increased 33% to 946.2 million in the six months, up from 710.3 million last time, greater 
than the 29% growth in passenger volumes from 14 million to 18 million as average fares rose 3% and ancillary 
revenues grew 40% to 129.4 million.
Operating profits were a record 237 million against 201.2 million. But as a result of the higher fuel costs, Ryanair's 
adjusted after tax margin fell three points to 25%. Ryanair shares fell 3.76% to 6.717 in early trading, down 0.263 in 
light London trading.
Profit before tax increased 19%, less than the growth in operating profit due to higher net interest charges arising 
from the increased level of debt. This was partially offset by foreign exchange gains.
Ryanair flies over doubled fuel charges
Although unit costs increased 8%, excluding fuel they fell 7% as all other cost items increased at a slower rate than 
the growth in passenger volumes.
There is always a confrontational side to OLearys statements and this time he attacked both BAA for its £4 billion 
plan to develop Stansted, which he says none of the users wants, and the Commission for Aviation Regulation in 
Ireland, which has allowed charges at Dublin Airport to rise 23% from January to pay for the proposed second 
terminal five years before its built.
OLeary is cautious about the second half as he believes the fare differentials between Ryanair and the flag carriers 
will be partially eroded as the fuel surchargers are forced to lower fares to compete with Ryanair.
We expect to achieve significant increases in passenger volumes, but also anticipate that yields in Q3 will be 
broadly in line with last year and Q4 yields will fall by a range of 5-10%, as previously guided. Our full year net profit 
guidance is unchanged, he added.
Meanwhile rivals easyJet carried 2.7 million passengers in October, 13.7% more than the same month a year ago, 
but the average load factor of its aircraft fell from 87% to 85.6%.
Citywire Verdict:
Airlines are rightly not a favourite sector for speculative share activity, but if you are inclined to put a toe in the 
water, then Ryanair is the place to be.

Body
Low-cost carrier, Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, today said his decision not to impose fuel surcharges 
on tickets has paid off in a rise in passenger numbers.
His comments come after the Irish airline announced record half year profits after tax of E237m, a rise of 18pc for 
the six months to the end of September.
The firm said passenger traffic grew by 29pc to 18 million while yields increased 3pc. This brought total revenues 
for the six months to E946.2m, a rise of 33pc.
 However, Michael O'Leary said: "We... remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year." Ryanair 
said its fuel costs had more than doubled during the six months to 30 September. It added that it expected costs to 
remain high "for some time". But the airline said its decision not to impose a fuel surcharge on customers had 
helped it increase the number of passengers it carried during the period by almost 30pc to 18 million.

September.
The firm said passenger traffic grew by 29pc to 18 million while yields increased 3pc. This brought total revenues

Pretax profits rose to E269.5m compared to E221.5m in 2004.
 Unit costs increased by 8pc (excluding fuel they fell by 7pc) as fuel costs rose by 108pc to E236.9m. Ryanair said 
significantly higher fuel costs pushed down the firm's adjusted after tax margin for the half year by 3 points to 25pc 
as adjusted net profit increased by 18pc to E237m. Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said: "We continue 
to remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year." He said the airline expects to achieve

and Q4 yields will fall by a range of -5pc to -10pc, adding that the firm's full year net profit guidance is unchanged.

The Dublin market closed higher today after Friday's decline, supported by DCC's results but limited by Ryanair.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 31.24 points to 6,702.17.
Banks were in focus this morning with Goodbody Stockbrokers noting that press reports over the weekend 
speculate that AIB is set to hold onto its asset manager in any decision on the future of its life business. "There has 
been much speculation in recent weeks/months that AIB is set to announce a life assurance joint venture with 
Aviva's Irish operations, Hibernian, though comments from AIB have generally failed to shed any light on proposed 
developments," the broker said.
 Shares in AIB rose by 12c to 1726 with three million shares traded. Bank of Ireland was up 8c to 1283 with 900,000 
shares changing hands. Anglo Irish bucked the trend and fell by 11c to 1126 while Irish Life & Permanent climbed 
13c to 1518.

British Airways PLC posted a 24 percent drop in second-quarter net profit Friday, blaming higher fuel costs and the 
absence of a large one-time gain that boosted the result a year ago.
However, the airline said it expects improved yields, or average fares, over the full year and raised its revenue 
guidance to between 6 percent and 7 percent growth _ up 0.5 percentage points from its previous forecast.
BA said net profit for the three months ending Sept. 30 fell to 171 million pounds ($302.1 million; 251.8 million 
euros) from 225 million pounds. Last year's net profit was boosted by an 86 million pound gain from the sale of 
shares in Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd.
The airline also revealed that an August strike by staff at catering firm Gate Gourmet and BA ground workers, which 
led to hundreds of canceled flights, cost the company between 35 million pounds and 45 million pounds ($61.8 
million and $79.5 million; 51.5 million euros and 66.25 million euros).
The figure was in line with analyst estimates and BA said the cost did not have a material impact on the quarterly 
results because the airline also suffered disruption in the comparative period last year.
Revenue rose 8.2 percent to 2.21 billion pounds ($3.9 billion; 3.25 billion euros).
"This is a reasonable set of results driven by improvements in revenue, seat factor and yield. It is clear, however, 
that we need to re-energize our drive on controllable costs," said Chief Executive Willie Walsh, who took over the 
reins at BA last month following the retirement of Rod Eddington.
"Costs are up in most areas. Fuel was the biggest single contributor, up a staggering 51.3 percent," he added.
Walsh reiterated that BA would not achieve its goal of a 10 percent operating margin, a target set by Eddington, this 
year because of record-high fuel costs.
The operating margin is operating income divided by revenue, and indicates how much a company makes from 
each dollar of sales, before interest and taxes. BA achieved an operating margin of 6.9 percent last year.
British Airways Profit Dips on Fuel Costs
BA earns the majority of its profits from its long-haul first- and business-class operations, including the trans-Atlantic 
route.
Walsh said that the airline's performance on the short-haul routes, where it faces tough competition from budget 
carriers like Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, was improving and is expected to be profitable over the full 
year.
He is also focused on the airline's move to a base at Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 5, which is due to be 
completed in 2008.
BA shares fell 2.5 percent to 306 pence ($5.35) on the London Stock Exchange.

Air Berlin moves in on UK market
 Air Berlin moves in on UK market

Body
Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline and Europe's third-largest low-cost carrier, is intensifying its attack on 
the UK market with the establishment of a hub transfer operation at London Stansted airport and the opening of its 
first two domestic routes in the UK.
The move marks the start of a direct challenge to Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low-cost carriers, on 
their home turf.
It also comes after the Irish and UK airlines have built up a significant presence in the German market, with bases 
at Frankfurt-Hahn, Berlin Schonefeld and Dortmund airports.
Joachim Hunold, managing partner of the privately-owned German carrier, said that, with their rivals competing in 
the German market, Air Berlin would "enjoy challenging them" in the UK.
Air Berlin will be the first airline to use London Stansted, the most important low-cost carrier airport in Europe, as a 
transfer hub.
Passengers from other airports in the UK wishing to travel to Germany will be able to check their luggage in for 
automatic transfer to their final destination.
All other carriers at Stansted use the airport exclusively for direct point-to-point flying and avoid the cost of transfer 
operations.
Mr Hunold said Air Berlin planned to launch domestic UK flights initially from Stansted to Glasgow and Manchester.
The group was also considering flying to other UK destinations, he said.
There was demand for flightsfrom several German cities to Glasgow and Manchester, but not yet sufficient to 
support direct flights.
Air Berlin moves in on UK market
Air Berlin already operates from Stansted, where it is the third largest carrier, to seven destinations in Germany 
including Berlin-Tegel, Dusseldorf and Nuremberg, as well as to its Spanish hub in Majorca and to Vienna through 
Niki, its affiliate Austrian airline.
The group is expanding quickly and expects to carry 13.8m passengers this year up from 12m in 2004.
Late last year the airline placed one of the biggest orders for new aircraft made by a European low-cost carrier.
It ordered 60 Airbus A320s for delivery up to 2011 with a further 10 ordered by Niki.
The first Airbus arrived last month and the group will take delivery of a second in December and nine in 2006.

Ryanair has said that many of its Dublin pilots will next month exercise their share options in the company.
The airline said that at the current share price (over E7), the pilots are in line to make a profit of E50,000 each. 
These share options, negotiated as part of a pay and benefits scheme in 2000, are due to be exercised at the end 
of November. 
The total value of the shares held by each qualifying pilot under the scheme are presently valued at over E175,000.
 In August, Ryanair pilots took high court action against the airline to force the firm to deal with trade unions. The 
case is one part of an ongoing row between pilots and Ryanair over retraining to fly the new 737/800 aircraft, which 
Ryanair recently introduced to all its routes.

Friday Lunchtime Market: Murdoch bows to pressure on BSkyB buyback

Body
Rupert Murdoch, chairman of British Sky Broadcasting, has retreated in the face of shareholder pressure and 
agreed not to extend the company's controversial share buyback scheme.
Voting on the two buyback resolutions at this morning's annual general meeting was close and will go to a poll 
published later this afternoon.
The buyback scheme could have raised Murdoch's News Corp's stake in the satellite broadcaster to 39% and has 
met with significant shareholder opposition. Jacob Rothschild, BSkyB deputy chairman, told shareholders that the 
buyback would not be extended beyond the current financial year ending June 2006.
The retreat was not enough to lift the share price, which traded 37p lower at 490p following poor quarterly 
subscription figures.
Meanwhile speculative buying of Ryanair Holdings shares ahead of Mondays figures were a key feature of this 
mornings trading.
Record figures are anticipated, and brokers Goodbody are forecasting a 17% increase to 173 million. Exane BNP 
Paribas has gone even higher: up 22% to 180 million. The shares rose 0.06 to 7.09 in active London trading with 
over 1.1 million shares changing hands.
Although Ryanair has gone no further than saying its figures are in line with expectations, high fuel charges during 
the summer should have been offset by cost cutting and higher yields.
It is expected to gain from its refusal to impose fuel surcharges unlike competitors such as British Airways, down 
10.625p or 3.39%, to 303.125p after its second quarter figures.
The FTSE 100 index raced 30 points higher in early trading, but fell back to a low of 5,421.5 at 8.50am, down 11.4. 
It recovered to climb for most of the morning and at 12.15 it was up 7.3 points at 5,439.2.
Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 was 6.1 points lower at 7,959.5, and the AIM All-Share up 3.5 to 1,008.4. Good volume 
for a Friday saw 109,486 deals involving 1.085 billion shares.
Friday Lunchtime Market: Murdoch bows to pressure on BSkyB buyback
Thursdays talk of a 460p a share or £3.7 billion bid for Amvescap from the US mutual fund Janus Capital boosted 
interest in the shares which topped the FTSE 100 leader board with a 10.375p rise to 386.625p with 5.5 million 
shares changing hands.
It was joined by Legal & General, up 2.25p to 111p, following a buy recommendation from UBS and a statement 
that said that new tax laws would not harm profits. Back in September the insurer warned that proposed legislation 
could leave it with a one-off tax charge of up to £500 million.
Also among the leaders were Diageo, 13p higher at 843p, Yell Group, plus 7p to 461p, and Friends Provident, 2.5p 
higher at 180.75p.
The big fallers were all the result of trading statements with Shire Pharmaceuticals sliding 12p to 688.5p. The 
largest traded stocks were O2, Vodafone and BSkyB.
Shire Pharmaceuticals went lower as analysts took differing views of Thursdays figures. UBS, for example, 
upgraded the stock from neutral to buy, but Lehman Brothers downgraded it from overweight to equal-weight.
Uncertainty surrounded brewers SABMiller ahead of next weeks figures with some concerned that the former South 
African Breweries paid too much for Columbia-based brewers Bavaria. But the shares still advanced 2p to £10.72 in 
light trading.
Among mid-cap shares, UK media group GCAP was a feature rising 9.625p to 350.625p on the back of speculation 
of a consortium bid valuing it £660 million.
In the FTSE 250 shares in baker Greggs went totally stale with a 262p fall to £46.18 following a profit warning and a 
reduced target price from Numis.
Rising oil prices and caution ahead of todays US jobs data made for lower prices in Frankfurt where the DAX-30 
was 4.99 points down at 5,006.01. Prices in Amsterdam were little changed, but profit taking hit Paris where the 
CAC-40 fell 11.15 points to 4,490.87.
In the currency markets sterling at 1.7648 went lower against the US dollar, and 1.4781 was also down against the

Body
Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, is planning to trial in-flight gambling by spring 2007, chief executive Michael O'Leary 
told a news briefing today.
He said the experiment, which will also include in-flight arcade games, will come around 12 months after the carrier 
trials on-board mobile phone use next spring.
Last April, Ryanair abandoned its first experiment in paid-for in-flight entertainment involving Hollywood films and 
kids cartoons after passengers showed reluctance to pay for what had once been a free service.
 O'Leary said the decision to trial in-flight gambling using portable consoles follows the phenomenal success of its 
scratch card offer. He dismissed the suggestion that the roll-out of gambling might discourage families from flying 
Ryanair. "We recognise your right to object, but good luck, somebody else will have your seat," he said. O'Leary 
was speaking after the airline launched a two-million "free" seat sale.

"We received the alarm at 10:33 pm yesterday, that the plane would make an emergency landing with only one

It was unclear whether the second motor had failed or had been switched off for some other reason, she said. The 
plane, a Boeing 737, landed at the Sturup airport in the southern Swedish town of Malmo at 10:58 pm without 
incident, according to Ahlberg.
 "It is more difficult to land with only one engine because the plane does not have the same force to break or speed 
up again if needed... Luckily, no one was injured," she said.

FL Group's increased EasyJet stake fuels bid speculation

Byline: By JAMES BOXELL
Body
FL Group, the acquisitive Icelandic investment group, disclosed yesterday that it had increased its stake in EasyJet 
to 16 per cent from 13 per cent since the beginning of the week.
The move meant the aviation investor's shareholding is almost on a par with Stelios Haji-Ioannou, founder and 
former chairman of the low-cost airline, who rejoined the board in May.
He owns 16.6 per cent compared to FL's 16.2 per cent. However, Mr Haji-Ioannou's brother and sister own about 
12 per cent each, giving the family a total shareholding of more than 40 per cent.
There has been speculation of a possible bid from FL since a year ago, when it started building its investment in 
EasyJet, the biggest European low-cost carrier after Ireland's Ryanair.
Mr Haji-Ioannou yesterday referred to previous statements, where he said he would not sell because he believed 
the stock was undervalued and that he was working with the board to enhance shareholder value.
The shares have almost doubled in the past year.
They fell 4p to 296 1/2p yesterday after rising sharply at the beginning of the week on speculation of the FL stake-
building. FL, which owns Icelandair, the Icelandic flag carrier, this week announced a DKr1.5bn (Pounds 137m) bid 
for Denmark's Sterling Airways, the biggest low-cost carrier in Scandinavia. FL also said it was planning to raise 
IKr44bn (Pounds 411m) to fund further expansion in its aviation portfolio.
The European low-cost airline sector, dominated by Ryanair and EasyJet, has become fragmented by a large 
number of start-ups looking to emulate thepioneers.
As well as needing the agreement of the Haji-Ioannou family, any bidder for EasyJet would faceadditional 
complications as the company's articles of association prevent non-UK investors from holding more than 40 per 
cent of the shares.
FL was unavailable for comment.

Losses as Irish aircraft maintenance firm, SR Technics, reached E21m in its last financial year, according to 
accounts filed at Companies Office.
The company, which maintains aircraft for companies like Aer Lingus, Ryanair and EasyJet, recently announced 
plans to cut 200 jobs at its base in Dublin airport. The accounts for 2004 indicate the serious challenge the 
company is facing as competition from Asia and eastern Europe continues, the Irish Times reported this morning.
The Irish operation, formerly called FLS Aerospace Ireland and prior to that TEAM Aer Lingus, had a turnover in 
2004 of E119m, down from E123m.
 Pre-tax losses were up to E21m from E11.2m the year before, an increase of 92pc. SR Technics, a Swiss firm, 
purchased FLS Aerospace, including the Irish operation, in June 2004. SR Technics says, since then, the Dublin 
business has undergone an "in-depth and focused integration process" which has been very successful.

Body
Terrorism in Egypt, the Asian tsunami along with hurricanes and earthquakes have all failed to quell the rising 
popularity of holidays to long-haul destinations.
First Choice Holidays (), which has been switching to long and medium-haul holiday opportunities to counter the 
short-haul competition from no frills airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet, saw mainstream summer sales up 13% 
making it confident of delivering double-digit earnings growth this year, in line with forecasts.
During the summer there was an 18% increase in those opting for long-haul holidays and 16% more on medium-
haul, the company said in a trading statement for the year to 5 October. Adventure holidays are increasingly 
popular with a 15% rise and 9% more customers are travelling to North America.
The trading statement said that all four sectors of the group performed strongly and it is getting closer to its 5% 
operating margin target. Less than 30% of its Mainstream Holidays are to short-haul destinations, Specialist 
Holidays had double-digit growth with Canada becoming increasingly popular and the one year old Hotelopia 
business-to-consumer on-line division was up 86%.
First Choice shares added 2.875p to 193.375p in moderate morning trading.
Winter bookings are down, but its still early days. With a 6% reduction in the Mainstream Holidays sector there are 
less packages to sell, Specialist Holiday bookings are down 4%, but revenue up 7%; Activity Holiday revenue is 
91% ahead of last year.
First Choice said it anticipated less demand for flight-only and what it calls 3-star generic holidays and adjusted its 
capacity accordingly.
Panmure Gordon still rates the shares a buy. Strong trading and higher margins have prompted it to raise its profit 
estimates by 5%. Morgan Stanley notes the bookings slowdown and reiterates its equalweight rating and 195p a 
share target price.
In June, First Choice revealed a loss before tax, exceptional items and goodwill of £34.1 million for the six months 
to 30 April, rather less than the £35-37 million expected by analysts.
Citywire verdict:
First Choice in for the long-haul
First Choice does not chase volume at the expense of profit. In an effort to match capacity with demand, it has 
reduced the capacity of its mainstream holidays by 6% this winter giving it less holidays to sell. This should help 
profits next year, providing chief executive Peter Long gets his forecasts right. Wait for the final figures.

Ryanair made E39m on last year on passengers who failed to show up for flights, a report in today's Irish 
Independent said.
The money was made from airport charges and taxes and the airline has a policy of refusing to refund such charges 
to its customers.
The E39m figure was based on analysis by the Irish Independent on regulatory filings made by Ryanair to US 
regulators.

Body
Ryanair has spoken out against a proposal from the Swedish government to introduce a new environmental flight 
tax of 100 kronor.
The firm said if the tax introduced it will harm the tourist business and economic growth in Sweden, which is urging 
the Swedish parliament to reject the proposal, according to a report in the Swedish newspaper The Local.
Airlines such as Fly Nordic Skyways and Malmo Aviation have also protested against the proposed new levy. The 
tax is part of government plans in the 2006 budget to raise taxes worth 3.6 billion crowns on what it sees as 
environmentally harmful energy uses.
 To counter the proposed tax, Ryanair is cutting prices by 100 kronor on return trips, CEO Michael O'Leary said at a 
press conference today. "Fixed environmental taxes have never had any positive effects on the environment, in that 
they do nothing to promote environmentally friendly alternatives," said O'Leary. The tax would not stop Ryanair from 
flying to Sweden, but the company said that when it came to expansion of routes, other European destinations 
would be prioritised.

FL Group set to add Sterling to aviation interests

Body
FL Group, the Icelandic aviation investment group that holds 13 per cent of EasyJet of the UK, is to take over 
Copenhagen-based Sterling Airways, Europe's fourth- largest low-cost airline.
The acquisition of Sterling is the latest move in a year of hectic deal-making by Icelandic investors in the European 
aviation sector and sparked heavy trading yesterday in EasyJet, Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by 
passenger numbers behind Ireland's Ryanair.
Since the first raid by FL a year ago there has been repeated speculation about a bid for EasyJet. Shares in the UK 
airline rose 13 3/4p or 5 per cent to close at 282 3/4p after heavy trading.
FL, which owns Icelandair the Icelandic flag carrier, is provisionally buying Sterling for DKr1.5bn (Dollars 240m) 
although the final price is dependent on performance.
FL said it was planning to raise IKr44bn (Dollars 728m) in fresh equity to fund its further expansion as an 
investment group with a growing array of aviation interests.
Sterling Airways was bought in March from Norwegian interests by Fons Eignarhaldsfelag, an Icelandic investment 
company controlled by partners Palmi Haraldsson and Johannes Kristinsson, for DKr400m.
During the summer Fons moved to consolidate a significant part of the Danish aviation sector by acquiring Maersk 
Air from AP Moeller-Maersk, the Danish shipping and energy group, and merging it with Sterling.
Both carriers have been heavily lossmaking and have been restructuring by seeking to adopt the low-cost 
scheduled airline model.
Sterling has become the number one low-cost carrier in Scandinavia and number four in Europe handling about 5m 
passengers a year. It ranks behind Ryanair, EasyJet and Air Berlin.
FL Group set to add Sterling to aviation interests
Ryanair and EasyJet dominate the low-cost sector, which has become fragmented with the launch of a large 
number of start-up carriers seeking to imitate the success of the pioneers in Europe. Hannes Smarason, chief 
executive of FL Group, said the increase in FL share capital would make "a fundamental change" to the company. It 
would strengthen its equity base and financial position, putting it in a position to tackle large and interesting 
investment projects in Iceland and abroad.
FL Group would be "looking for investment opportunities both independently and in collaboration with other major 
investors".
Mr Smarason said the takeover of Sterling was aimed at taking part "in the rapidly growing low-fare market in 
northern Europe".
"We see a lot of opportunities there as a result of the changes that have been made to Sterling and not least the 
likely developments that lie ahead," he said.
FL plans to buy Sterling for DKr1.1bn in cash and DKr400m in FL group shares although the purchase price could 
rise or fall by up to DKr500m depending on Sterling's 2006 financial performance with the group forecasting a 
strong turnround following its merger with Maersk Air.
FL said its IKr44bn equity issue had been secured. Its largest shareholders were buying shares for IKr28bn, the 
Icelandic banks Kaupthing Bank and Landsbanki were investing IKr5bn and IKr3bn respectively in cash and key 
employees of FL were investing IKr3bn. The two banks were underwriting the offer of a further IKr5bn to institutions.

Having been recently made redundant from a commuter airline operating from a UK regional airport I find myself 
effectively consigned to the scrapheap – at the age of 49.
This sad state of affairs exists because I am unable to fund my way through a new type rating that would, it is to be 
hoped, enable my career to continue. The scheme operated by airlines such as Ryanair, EasyJet and others are 
out of my reach because, having remortgaged my property, there is no more money in the pot.
An ex-colleague had to borrow at least £23,000 ($40,500) to go down this route. He is now in training and should 
emerge Boeing 737-rated and with a job.
So, having spent 19 years with an unblemished record (17 as an aircraft commander) on a variety of turboprops 
and a jet, with more than 9,000h, that would appear to be it.
Don’t forget us old ‘uns. We might not have the money – but our experience may just save airlines from incidents 
they’d rather not have. There is no substitute for good training and experience.

Ryanair has criticised what it calls the "growing trend of over-regulation in the EU and at national level".
Speaking this morning at an Aviation Regulatory Seminar in London, Ryanair's head of Regulatory Affairs and 
company secretary, Jim Callaghan, said the trend was undermining low fares, competition and choice for European 
consumers in air transport and protecting failing national airlines like Alitalia.
Callaghan singled the European Commission for criticism, saying it had a "complete lack of understanding of the 
huge and very beneficial changes that have taken place since liberalisation of the air transport industry". 
 "This has resulted in ludicrous legislation like the passenger compensation debacle, which is discriminatory and 
anti-competitive and does nothing for consumers, except to increase unnecessarily the cost of air transport," he 
said. He said the Commission misapplied rules state aid rules in the Charleroi case while approving of another 
E2.3bn in state aid to Alitalia. Callaghan also criticised the UK's Civil Aviation Authority and its proposals to impose 
a STG1 levy on all passengers in order to cross subsidise failing airlines.

Centralwings, the low-cost subsidiary of Lot Polish Airlines, has started negotiations with Airbus and Boeing on an 
order for up to 24 aircraft.
Centralwings began flying in February as the response by Lot, the Polish flag-carrier, to the expansion by low-cost 
carriers in eastern Europe, most importantly SkyEurope Airlines and Wizz Air, which have captured market share.
SkyEurope, with its headquarters in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, has operating bases in Warsaw and Krakow, 
while Hungary's Wizz Air has Polish bases in Warsaw and Katowice. Ireland's Ryanair, the leading European low-
cost carrier, is also expanding quickly in Poland with links from London Stansted to eight Polish regional airports.
Piotr Kociolek, Centralwings chief executive, said the airline was planning to double its fleet of five this year. It 
operates second-hand Boeing 737s but is considering a fleet of up to 24 new aircraft by 2010.
Mr Kociolek said Centralwings, which took over Lot's charter operations, would carry around 700,000 passengers 
this year including 400,000 on charter services and 300,000 on scheduled routes.
This was expected to more than double next year to 1.6m with the low-cost sceduled part of the business 
expanding from 300,000 in 2005 to 1m.
He said the charter operations were profitable and the whole business was forecast to become profitable in 2008. It 
has made its strongest advances in the market between Poland and the UK and Ireland. Services between London 
Gatwick and Warsaw and Krakow are operating and it is adding flights from Warsaw to Edinburgh and Shannon, 
and from Katowice and Wroclaw to Dublin. Kevin Done, London

Six years ago Ryanair was successfully taken to Ireland's equality tribunal for actively trying to recruit a "young, 
dynamic and energetic" person. The low fares airline was deemed to have communicated an intention to 
discriminate on the basis of age.
The tribunal rejected Ryanair's defence that it was looking for a candidate who was not so much young, as "young 
at heart".
A number of other companies had been challenged over jobs advertisements, but they had all agreed to 
readvertise. Only Ryanair decided to fight the case.
This was the first case brought to court by the Equality Authority, a statutory body set up under the Irish Republic's 
1998 employment equality legislation. The legislation was subsequently extended to cover not just employment but 
also the provision of goods and services in public and private sectors.
"The Ryanair case was very important for the debate it generated. Until then there was an impression that this 
equality legislation was political correctness gone mad," says Niall Crowley, chief executive of the authority.
Ireland effectively has a single piece of legislation that covers all the main areas of discrimination - on age, gender, 
race, religion, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, disability and membership of the Irish traveller 
community.
"Employers have got wise to the legislation. They know they can't ask questions of potential recruits that touch on 
any of the areas of discrimination," says Catherine O'Connor, associate with William Fry, a leading firm of solicitors 
in Dublin.
Today companies are much more careful - and the Equality Authority is equally vigilant in scrutinising their actions.
The authority estimates that it took about 900 cases last year. In addition, people can take their own cases, as can 
trade unions on behalf of members.
Job advert landed Ryanair in trouble
A recent case saw John Ross, a pensioner, successfully take action against an insurance company that refused to 
insure him to drive. That was in 2002, when he was 77.
Paul Murray of Age Action Ireland says insurance is a key area, with older people either refused health and driving 
cover, as in this case, or charged exorbitant premiums, not based on actuarial evidence.
In the area of public services, Age Action is campaigning against the government's provision of free breast scans 
for women under 65. It wants total access.
In 2004, a number of changes were made to the legislation. Until then, the provisions of the law applied only to 
people between 18 and 65 - the argument being that after 65 you were of pensionable age. The 2004 act sets no 
upper limit and reduced the minimum age that the legislation would cover to 16. The amended legislation allows 
employers to set out mandatory retirement ages in their contracts with employees.

Brazil offers the best illustration of how the low-fare, low-cost model can be applied in Latin America, reports 
Jonathan Wheatley in Sao Paulo.
At one end of the market are the legacy carriers. Vasp and Transbrasil, two venerable pioneers, are grounded. 
Varig, the flag carrier, limps on under bankruptcy protection and is likely to emerge as an international carrier with a 
vastly reduced domestic network. Varig creditors met yesterday to discuss sales of assets and possibly the 
company itself.
In the middle is TAM, which has grown from an air taxi service to become Brazil's biggest airline. It competes on 
quality, efficiency and reliability, rather than price.
At the other extreme is Gol - "the only really proven, successful low-cost carrier in Latin America", according to 
Bobby Booth of AvGroup, an aviation consultancy in Miami. But Gol is not entirely like other low-cost pioneers, such 
as the UK's Ryanair or Southwest of the US. For one, it does not follow their "point to point" model. About half of 
Gol's customers make a connection. But it does, says Richard Lark, chief financial officer, follow their methods of 
revenue management and fleet management, producing what he says is one of the highest aircraft utilisation rates 
in the world.
Although flying by Gol is cheaper than flying by TAM (its peak fare between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro is 
RDollars 199 (USDollars 89), compared with RDollars 552 at TAM), Gol's standard fares do not compete with 
coach travel, as Ryanair and the others do. Gol's only other rival is WebJet, a one-aircraft outfit that began 
operating in July.
INTERNATIONAL: BRAZIL 'S GOL SHOWS THE WAY - 'THE ONLY REALLY PROVEN,  SUCCESSFUL 
LOW-COST CARRIER IN LATIN AMERICA'
In a market where 70 per cent of passengers fly on business and 30 per cent on leisure - the reversal of the 
situation in the US - Gol's main target is the cost-conscious business traveller. But Gol does compete for coach 
travellers at off-peak times. If you do not mind flying at 1am, you can get from Sao Paulo to Rio for RDollars 40.
Since Gol began operating four years ago, the number of people using air travel in Brazil has increased from about 
5.5m to about 7.5m. This is not all due to Gol, but the airline says passenger surveys carried out each year have 
shown that 10-15 per cent of its passengers are flying for the first time.

Ryanair has lost its bid to prevent an investigation of complaints by pilots about conditions at the airline.
Ryanair had challenged the Labour Court's right to hear the pilots' complaints represented by their union IALPA, but 
their challenge was rejected by the High Court, according to RTE News.
However, Ryanair has confirmed that it is to immediately appeal the decision.
 The airline had argued that new industrial relations law effectively introduces compulsory union recognition by the 
back door and should not apply to a high pay multi-national like Ryanair. Ryanair also argued that the Labour Court 
had no jurisdiction to hear the case because the company has already got adequate internal bargaining and dispute 
resolution procedures. It also alleged that the Labour Court had acted incorrectly and unfairly in deciding that it had 
jurisdiction to hear the case. However, Mr Justice Michael Hanna found against Ryanair on every point. His ruling 
clears the way for the Labour Court to carry out a substantive investigation of the pilots' complaints.

The Dublin market closed down for the eight straight day, with most heavyweights affected.
At the close, the ISEQ index was down 24.02 points to 6643.3.
Shares were down among many heavyweights with volumes reflecting a reluctance to commit to a renewal of the 
buying spree seen on the market in recent weeks amid continuing uncertainty on the global economy.
 The economic gloom here worsened following news yesterday that inflation rose sharply from 2.3pc in August to 
3pc in September, according to the CSO. The only blue-chip risers were Eircom, up 1c to 2.02; Elan, up 2 to 662; 
and Ryanair, up 3c to 673. Comreg yesterday issued a direction imposing regulatory obligations on Vodafone, O2 
and Meteor in relation to mobile termination charges which should lead to reductions in the charges that consumers 
have to pay for calling a mobile from a fixed line or from another mobile network. According to analysts, this is very 
positive news for eircom's fixed line business as its customers should see a significant reduction in their monthly 
bills at very little cost to eircom as fixed-to-mobile traffic is very low margin.

Pilot blames stress for bad landing
Irish budget carrier Ryanair has stepped up its stress-awareness training after investigators found that a shambolic 
approach conducted by a Boeing 737-800 crew led to a serious high-speed landing incident at Stockholm Skavsta 
airport.
Specialists from the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) have concluded that the aircraft's captain was under 
personal pressure at the time, prompting "irrational" and "inexplicable" behaviour which was "contrary" to all his 
training.
While the flight from London Stansted on 21 July last year had been uneventful, the captain was late starting the 
descent into Skavsta. He then became concerned about being too high on the visual approach and, while 
attempting to establish an appropriate glide profile, pushed the aircraft into a steep descent, with the 737 exceeding 
12° nose-down pitch.
The aircraft's descent rate at times reached 6,200ft/min (32m/s) and its increasing airspeed prevented the selection 
of the correct flap setting for landing.
"During this time normal operator procedures were not followed and crew resource management requirements were 
so ignored as to be non-existent," says the AAIU in its report into the event. It says that the relatively junior first 
officer recollected suggesting the aircraft was flying too high and too fast, but that these statements had no effect.
Unstable high-speed Ryanair 737 approach forces Irish carrier to re-evaluate and improve its training 
procedures
No go-around was requested and ground-proximity warning system alarms were ignored. The 737 landed at about 
180kt (330km/h) - about 30-40kt above normal touchdown speed - in the correct zone of the runway, with its flaps at 
10° rather than the normal 30°.
None of the 184 passengers and six crew members was injured, but the AAIU says: "It was fortuitous that the 
landing was carried out safely."
In a statement to the investigators, the captain - who had been on his last day of duty at the airline before moving 
abroad - explained that he had been suffering personal problems and should have called in sick.
He admitted to feeling psychologically and physiologically fatigued and said: "I cannot understand myself how it was 
possible for me to show such poor judgement. I can only imagine that certain personal stresses and tiredness 
affected my ability to think rationally."
Ryanair has since introduced additional training, in line with investigators' recommendations, to draw attention to 
the "insidious" nature of stress, and highlight the need for first officers to demonstrate appropriate assertiveness.

European Council of Ministers has reached agreement today guaranteeing the rights of persons with reduced

The debate over access at airports came to the fore last year when a disabled traveller who was forced to pay to

Agreeing the deal for Ireland, Minister for Transport, Martin Cullen said the deal "guarantees full and free access" 
for all Irish people at all EU airports.
 The agreement on mobility access, which will now be adopted by each Member State, prohibits operators from 
denying reservation or boarding to persons because of their disability or age. It also guarantees such persons the 
right to receive assistance free of charge at airports and on board aircraft. The Member States will lay down 
penalties and set up independent bodies to deal with complaints. Airport managers will be subject to the obligation 
to provide the assistance and will be able to charge airlines for the service.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday it expects rival European airlines to trim their ticket prices in a challenge to the 
no-frills carrier, but reaffirmed its forecasts of continued strong growth and profit.
In an earnings update, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said other airlines _ which, unlike Ryanair, have added fuel 
surcharges to their tickets _ will be "forced to lower their underlying fares to compete." 
But he said Ryanair remained "cautious but comfortable" with its previous earnings forecasts.
The airline said it carried 3,023,819 passengers in September, 27 percent higher than the same month in 2004, 
reflecting the expansion of Ryanair's route network. Passenger "load" _ the number of seats filled _ remained 
steady at 87 percent.
O'Leary also announced Tuesday that the company had exercised its option to buy nine more Boeing 737-800 
aircraft for delivery in 2007.
Ryanair said it currently operates 83 Boeing 737-800s and nine Boeing 737-200s, but has firm orders to operate 
234 Boeing 737-800s by 2012, and has negotiated options to buy up to 179 more between 2008 and 2014.

Overall, assuming that the last deliveries were made on or around 1 September, Boeing had delivered around 216 
aircraft in 2005. The bulk of these were 737s, still in the process of going through a production rate ramp-up with 
159 delivered, including at least four BBJs. The second largest tally was made up of 777s of which 30 had been 
delivered. Nine were 717s built at Long Beach, which was unaffected by the strike, nine were 747s, seven were 
767s and two were the final 757s which had been in storage since completion in 2004. According to details 
obtained by Flight International, Boeing originally planned to deliver at least 101 additional aircraft by year-end, 
taking it close to the 320 figure projected by the company earlier in 2005.
These comprise five more 717s and was to also embrace at least 69 737s, including one US Navy version and four 
BBJ1/2s. The list also consists of six 747-400F/ERFs, four 767-300ER/ERFs and 17 777-200ER/300ERs. In terms 
of individual customers, the operator with the most in the pipeline in sheer numbers appears to be Ryanair, which 
has 10 737s due for delivery by the end of 2005. Southwest Airlines follows closely with seven 737s, with AirTran, 
Aeromexico, Qantas and Hainan all due to receive five 737s apiece over the next three months.
Other 737s are scheduled for delivery to West Jet (four), Continental (three), THY (two), Air China (three), Shanghai 
(one), China Eastern (two) and Shandong (two). In value terms, the two most heavily affected are Emirates and 
Etihad with five 777s apiece, due for delivery by year-end, while close behind is Air New Zealand with three 
scheduled 777 deliveries, Air France (two), ANA (one 777, two 767s) and Vietnam Airlines (one 777). Of the six 
scheduled 747s, two are destined for Singapore Airlines Cargo, two for Korean Air, one for Cargolux and one for Air 
China Cargo. One 767 is due each to LAN Airlines and JAL.
Assuming a general slide of the delivery sequence to the right, and a minimal recovery of lost time before 
December, there appear to be at least 21 aircraft at risk of not being delivered by the end of the year as currently 
scheduled. The companies that might possibly see completions slip into the first month of 2006 include Ryanair 
(five 737s), Qantas (two 737s), Southwest, Air China, THY, ANA, Aeromexico and Hainan Airlines (all one 737 
each) and General Electric Commercial Aviation Services (two 737s for Skymark Airlines and China Southern). 
Deliveries to slip after machinists' walkout
Late-year widebody deliveries possibly affected could include a single 747-400F for SIA, one 777-200ER for Air 
New Zealand, two 777-300ERs for Air France and two -300ERs for Etihad Airways.
Ryanair may have to wait until next year for some of its aircraft

Ryanair warns major carriers will slash prices

Body
Budget airline Ryanair has warned of a likely price war as major carriers slash prices to compete with its low fares.
Chief executive Michael OLeary said, however, that he remains cautious but comfortable with prospects for the 
year.
His comments, given at an investor day in London, coincide with the arrival at arch rival British Airways (BAY) of 
new chief executive and fellow Irishman Willie Walsh.
Walsh gained a reputation as a ferocious cost cutter at Aer Lingus and is thought to be planning similar action at 
BA.
OLeary lost no time in needling Walsh, reminding him that in August Ryanair (RYA) carried more passengers on its 
short haul European network than BA - now just the worlds second favourite airline - did on its entire worldwide 
network.
OLeary said higher fuel prices over the summer months had been partially offset by a combination of other cost 
reductions and a slightly more benign yield environment.
However, he remained cautious about the winter: We expect yields to benefit from the multiple fuel surcharges 
imposed by the high fare carriers across Europe. However, we anticipate that the fare differential between Ryanair 
and the flag carriers will be partially eroded as the fuel surchargers are forced to lower their underlying fares to 
compete with Ryanairs lower prices.
He said for the rest of the year he anticipates strong load factors and passenger volumes but, as expected, at 
slightly lower yields.
OLeary said the recent strike by Boeing would have no material impact and deliveries of new aircraft would be back 
on track by the end of December.
He also confirmed that Ryanair was going ahead with the purchase of nine more Boeing 737-800 aircraft worth over 
$500 million.
During 2007 the airline would sell five of its older Boeing 737-800s, acquired in 1999.
The shares were unchanged at 6.8 euros.

Ryanair has confirmed that it has exercised options on a 9 Boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery in 2007.
The airline plans to sell 5 of its Boeing 737-800 purchased in 1999 during 2007.
Speaking during an investor event in London, Michael O'Leary said current trading continues to be in line with 
expectations.
 He said higher fuel prices over the summer months have been partly offset by a combination of other cost 
reductions and slightly more benign yield environment. O'Leary added that the airline remained cautious in its 
outlook for the winter because of an anticipated erosion in the fare differential between Ryanair and the flag 
carriers. "We therefore remain cautious but comfortable with our previous guidance for the remainder of this fiscal 
year as we anticipate strong load factors and passenger volumes but as expected, at slightly lower yields." O'Leary 
said the recent announcement of the cessation of the Boeing strike will in turn enable our aircraft deliveries to be 
"back on track" by the end of December 2005, and said he expects no material adverse impact on the company's 
financial performance or passengers carried arising from the strike.

Body
Ryanair is said to be planning a fares war targeting Aer Lingus on routes between Dublin and the Continent. 
Travellers are set to benefit from lower fares as a result of secret negotiations between the budget carrier and 
Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), according to a report in the Irish Independent.
Ryanair intends to add 20 new routes out of Dublin to continental Europe. 
 It has offered to move to the basement of Dublin Airport to relieve chronic overcrowding and is willing to drop all its 
objections to the airport's contentious E1.2bn expansion plan. However, the airline will only go ahead if it can 
secure a significant reduction in passenger charges, according to the newspaper.

ING has closed an export credit financing for Ryanair's 10 recently delivered 737-800 aircraft.
ING was sole arranger and debt provider on the deal, which was denominated in euros.
"It was Ryanair's preference, as most of its revenues come in Euros," says Terina Golfinos, head of ING 
Wholesale's structured export finance for the Americas.
The deal is structured as a series of loans, with Ex-Im Bank guaranteeing up to 85% of the purchase price of the 
aircraft.
The deal was arranged out of ING's New York office, led by Golfinos, and also with the Dublin office, led by Alan 
Duffs. "We have a good relationship with Ryanair," says Golfinos. "However, it was ING's first Ex-Im Bank-
guaranteed deal with the airline."
The deal closed in September, when the first aircraft was delivered. Theother nine aircraft will deliver before the end 
of 2005. The bank was mandated for the deal in May after a competitive bidding process. It is thought that Ryanair 
received very good pricing on the deal. Golfinos says: "They are very. confident people, and I cannot imagine them 
doing a deal unless it is very much to their liking."(c) Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC This material must be

ING has closed an export credit financing for Ryanair's 10 recently delivered 737-800 aircraft. 
 ING was sole arranger and debt provider on the deal, which was denominated in euros. "It was Ryanair's 
preference, as most of its revenues come in Euros," says Terina Golfinos, head of ING Wholesale's structured 
export finance for the Americas.  
 The deal is structured as a series of loans, with Ex-Im Bank guaranteeing up to 85% of the purchase price of the 
aircraft. 
 The deal was arranged out of ING's New York office, led by Golfinos, and also with the Dublin office, led by Alan 
Duffy. "We have a good relationship with Ryanair," says Golfinos. "However, it was ING's first Ex-Im Bank-
guaranteed deal with the airline." 
 The deal closed in September, when the first aircraft was delivered. The other nine aircraft will deliver before the 
end of 2005. The bank was mandated for the deal in May after a competitive bidding process.  It is thought that 
Ryanair received very good pricing on the deal. Golfinos says: "They are very confident people, and I cannot 
imagine them doing a deal unless it is very much to their liking."

Irish unions pledge to block ports in ferry row
 Irish unions pledge to block ports in ferry row

Irish trade unions yesterday threatened to blockade Dublin and other ports in a dispute over the employment of 
foreign workers at a ferry company that has seen Bertie Ahern, the prime minister, attack the company in 
parliament.
Irish Continental Group (ICG), owner of Irish Ferries, has set a deadline of Sunday for 540 of its Irish workers to 
accept a redundancy offer, enabling the company to replace them with cheaper east European labour on a contract 
basis.
Ireland, the UK and Sweden were the only European Union member countries to provide immediate access to their 
labour markets for workers from central and eastern European states following enlargement in June 2004. ICG says 
it has to cut costs if it wants to be able to compete with rival ferry companies, which have foreign crews, as well as 
Ryanair and other low-cost airlines.
David Begg, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, described as "deeply obscene" ICG's plans to 
"dump 543 workers and replace them with people on around Euros 3 per hour".
He told a conference: "This should serve as a wake-up call for legislators at a national and EU level."
Mr Ahern told the Dail on Wednesday he would "not defend for one second" the manner in which the company has 
acted. He added: "The jobs will be filled by non-nationals from God knows where, and on conditions that nobody 
knows."
In an unprecedented public attack on an Irish company, he described ICG's restructuring plan as "sharp practice", 
which he said was "totally unacceptable in the Irish labour context".
Since the late 1980s Ireland has had a system of centralised wage agreements, under which workers agree to 
restrain pay demands in exchange for tax cuts. But economists are puzzled by the prime minister's intervention, 
Irish unions pledge to block ports in ferry row
pointing out that the economy's continuing strong performance - with gross domestic product projected at around 5 
per cent this year and 6 per cent in 2006 - is increasingly dependent on the continued inflow of foreign workers.
The company yesterday claimed that almost 70 per cent of the affected workers had indicated they would accept 
the offer.
But unions disputed this claim.

Boeing Workers to Vote on Revised Contract

A likely end to the strike at Boeing Co.'s commercial airplanes division could be one of those rare labor-
management deals where both sides feel like winners.
"Not to say, 'Hurray, we all win!', but both sides can claim victory," said analyst Richard Aboulafia with the Teal 
Group.
About 18,400 Machinists are scheduled to vote Thursday on a new three-year contract offer which, if approved, 
would allow Boeing to swiftly reopen its commercial airplane assembly facilities in the Puget Sound area, Gresham, 
Ore. and Wichita, Kan.
The new proposal gives workers a nearly 17 percent boost in pension payouts and guarantees retiree medical 
benefits for new hires. It also assures that health care premiums remain the same as the current contract, among 
other changes.
But it also calls for no general wage increase, instead opting for lump sum bonuses totaling about $11,000 over 
three years. And it takes away a previously offered provision that would have given workers pay incentives based 
on corporate financial performance.
Leaders of Machinists District Lodge 751 in Seattle say the deal is "a victory for working families across the country" 
that addresses the issues most important to its members, who average 49 years of age and currently make about 
$59,000 a year.
The company says the total cost is similar to its previous offer, and analysts say the resolution allows the company 
to quickly regain the momentum it needs to continue its heated battle with rival Airbus SAS.
"Call it a draw," said analyst J.B. Groh with D.A. Davidson.
Investors appeared to welcome the tentative agreement, sending Boeing shares up $1.47, or 2.3 percent, to close 
at $64.67 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. In the last 52 weeks, shares have traded between $48.10 and 
$68.38.
Boeing Workers to Vote on Revised Contract
The new proposal comes just over three weeks after the Machinists walked off the job after union leadership 
deemed the company's previous offer "insulting." Both sides had insisted since then that they were miles apart and 
unsure when a happy medium could be reached.
But Aboulafia said the surprise announcement late Sunday that a proposal had been brokered could mean that the 
two weren't nearly as far apart as public posturing would suggest. The revised offer also shows how important it 
appears to have been for both sides to get back to making airplanes.
Boeing is beginning to gain momentum in its commercial airplane business, which fell off drastically after the Sept. 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But customers including All Nippon Airways Co. and Ryanair Holdings PLC had said the 
strike was delaying deliveries and affecting their route plans. Groh said it was unlikely that customers would cancel 
orders over the strike, but such delays could erode good will.
Japan's ANA is set to be the launch customer for the company's new 787, for example, and the aerospace 
company is likely eager to keep that airline happy.
The fact that the union was able to get the contract it did _ including no health care premium increases amid 
soaring health care costs nationwide _ shows just how powerful the skilled Machinists are, even as other unions are 
losing clout. But Aboulafia said Machinists leadership may still have worried that being too tough in contract 
negotiations would lead to more outsourcing for future airplanes, such as the new 787.
"The one thing that gives (the union) that power is that outsourcing jobs takes a lot of time, but if you make life very 
difficult for the manufacturer these jobs are leaving," Aboulafia said.
Mark Blondin, District Lodge 751 president, said fears about outsourcing didn't play a role.
"We felt we were in a good position this time to hold a hard line on the issues, but we weren't overreaching, either," 
he said.
Still, analyst Chris Lozier with Morningstar was surprised the union didn't hold out longer for an even better deal, 
especially after complaining bitterly about the company's pension offer of $66 a month for each year worked.
In the new proposal, Boeing increased that figure to $70, up from $60 currently, but the company said the union at 
one point asked for those payouts to increase to $80. The union wouldn't confirm that number.
"I don't think it was a clear victory for one side or the other, although I think that the Machinists could've gotten 
more," Lozier said.

Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has hit out at proposals from the aviation industry regulator to 
impose a Pounds 1 levy on all airline tickets, saying air passengers would be subsidising "financially flaky airlines 
and tour operators".
The Civil Aviation Authority is renewing efforts to persuade ministers to introduce the levy, which would provide 
consumer protection and replace Air Travel Organisers' Licensing bonds. These were introduced in 1977 to protect 
holidaymakers from the potential collapse of tour operators.
But with more people travelling on low-cost airlines, which are not covered by Atol bonding, the CAA has called for 
a system that better reflects travel trends.
However, airlines such as British Airways and Ryanair oppose the plan. Mr O'Leary said: "It is wrong for ordinary 
passengers booking on successful airlines such as Ryanair to be asked to subsidise passengers booking with 
financially flaky airlines and tour operators, because the CAA is not doing its job correctly. It is like asking Chelsea 
to give points to relegated teams at the end of every season."
The CAA has considered several options for a scheme to replace Atol. It appointed Ernst & Young, the accountancy 
firm, to determine the most effective protection mechanism and expressed confidence the levy is best.
"People are not financially protected when they travel on low-cost airlines," said Richard Jackson, director of 
consumer protection at the CAA. "We think low-cost airlines are a good thing. But these airlines are competing in 
the European holiday market without bearing the same costs of protection as tour operators." The CAA says the 
Consumers' Association, Air Transport Users Council, Trading Standards Institute and Association of British Travel 
Agents back the scheme.
Ministers are expected to respond to the recommendations on October 10, when the aviation bill will have its third 
reading in parliament.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary expects the Irish low-cost carrier to add feeder services for a long-haul, 
low-cost operation - but not in the near future.
O'Leary says Ryanair's short-haul expansion in Europe would eventually lead to the carrier gaining a critical mass 
where the development of a complementary long-haul operation would represent a "logical extension".
But he warns that, although the move would represent a coherent strategy if predicted growth fulfils current 
forecasts, a long-haul airline would either need to be created or identified to complement the activities of the low-
cost operation, which would be kept separate.
"It is a logical extension to look to some long-haul, low-cost service in the future as we have all the links in Europe - 
a comprehensive feeder system - but this certainly won't be as Ryanair itself and not within five years' time," says 
O'Leary, adding that there are no immediate plans to develop the strategy.
He says Ryanair would also need sufficient critical mass for the strategy to work - around 100 million passengers a 
year, or nearly three times its projected 35 million annual passenger total for 2005.
"We have said all along in our business plan that we want to grow the business to 50 million passengers over the 
next five years and then we could well go further and attempt to double that to 100 million passengers over the next 
five-year period until 2015," says O'Leary. "But we are very busy at the moment. We have our aircraft orders and 
expansion strategy in place and that is more than enough for us to be going on with."
-The machinists' strike at Boeing has forced Ryanair to change its flight schedule to cope with the delayed delivery 
of at least seven 737-800s. "If the strike did continue to Christmas we would have to make cancellations and delay 
new route development in December and January," says O'Leary. Three 737-200s due to be retired in September 
will continue flying for another month.

New chief takes delivery of a challenging flight plan

Willie Walsh has had five months to learn the ropes from Sir Rod Eddington. But from the weekend the induction 
period ends and he will start to fly solo as chief executive of British Airways.
Mr Walsh, 43, a former pilot, comes to BA from Aer Lingus, the Irish state-owned airline, which he saved from the 
brink of bankruptcy.
He took over the helm there in the wake of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, which plunged global 
aviation into crisis, and transformed it into one of the most profitable carriers in Europe, imitating many of the 
methods used by local Dublin rival Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline.
His surprise appointment to run BA, one of the top three European airlines, has moved him in to the premier league 
of the global aviation industry and to an airline that is more than 10 times the size of the Irish carrier.
Mr Walsh takes over an airline that last year emerged with the highest operating profit of any carrier worldwide. BA 
remains, however, some way from achieving the target set by Sir Rod of a 10 per cent operating margin, and Mr 
Walsh's in-tray is filling rapidly as he seeks to fill the shoes of one of the most highly regarded chief executives in 
world aviation.
He will immediately face tough headwinds with the challenge posed by record oil prices, as well as having to deal 
with considerable leftover business in reforming BA's fragile labour relations.
The airline has suffered turmoil for three successive summers at Heathrow airport, its global hub, and last month its 
operations were again thrown into chaos by an unlawful, unofficial strike by 1,000 ground services staff.
The wildcat strike paralysed its Heathrow operations, forcing the cancellation of more than 700 flights and stranding 
110,000 passengers worldwide.
The reform of working practices among some of its key groups of employees at Heathrow will be high on the Walsh 
agenda, as he prepares the airline for one of the most momentous moves in its history, the switch at the end of 
March 2008 of its operations at Heathrow to the new Terminal Five.
New chief takes delivery of a challenging flight plan
For the first time, BA will have all its activities at Heathrow under one roof, as it moves from terminals one and four, 
offering it a "once in a lifetime" opportunity, according to Sir Rod, to rationalise its operations, increase efficiency 
and save costs while transforming the travel experience for passengers.
The task of completing the move will fall squarely to Mr Walsh, as will planning the ambitious renewal of the airline's 
long-range fleet, including the possible purchase of the Airbus A380 superjumbo and the renewal of the airline's 
onboard products.
Later this year will see the launch of a new generation fully-flat bed in long-haul business class.
Mr Walsh brings to BA his reputation as a tough cost-cutter. But rivals opponents may remember that it was his last 
business plan at Aer Lingus, envisaging further deep job cuts, which hastened his departure from the airline, after 
he ran into growing union and government opposition.

under pressure.
At 10.15am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was 65.49 points down to 6589.49.
The approach of Hurricane Rita to the Gulf of Mexico has already begun to disrupt to equity markets across the 
world.
 In banking news, introduction of a new current account switching code at the end of January has seen 10,000 
consumers take up the initiative and move their account elsewhere. Goodbody Stockbrokers says the number of 
accounts lost by each of the major players (AIB & BOI) through this new code appears low at this stage, but is 
expected to rise. AIB was down 20c to 1720, while Bank of Ireland fell 20 to 1260. On the second line, Anglo Irish 
slipped 7 to 1080 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 10 to 1485. Among the heaviest fallers was Elan, down 20 to

Aer Arann today said that it will cut the number of Cork-Dublin flights from nine to three per day when Ryanair 
begins operating on that route.
From November 24, Aer Arann will run only three return flights on the route, with the cheapest one-way fare of 
E29.99 excluding tax. Ryanair plans to begin operating three return flights on the same day with equivalent fares as 
low as 99 cent.
A spokesperson for Aer Arann said the move would not affect staff numbers in Cork in the short term, as the airline 
would continue to offer flights to Birmingham, Bristol, Southampton, Edinburgh and Belfast City.

No-fares flying?
Prediction Irish low-cost airline Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary last week predicted fare-free airline travel 
within a decade and launched a blistering attack on European Union attempts to re-regulate the air transport 
industry. O'Leary used the keynote speech at the World Low Cost Airlines Congress in Amsterdam to deliver a 
broadside at the European Commission's recent spate of regulations, including the introduction of rules governing 
passenger compensation for delays, which he claimed are designed to prop up national flag carriers. O'Leary also 
predicted a shift to free flights as a standard business model within 10 years. Airport operators would give airlines a 
cut of their retail revenues, as well as incidental revenues earned from direct baggage handling charges, onboard 
catering, shopping and crucially, as-yet unavailable gambling services, he said.

Body
Irish budget airline Ryanair on Tuesday announced minor modifications to its September and October flight 
schedules due to delays in the delivery of seven aircraft from Boeing.
Ryanair Holdings PLC said it didn't expect to receive the aircraft until November and December, two months later 
than scheduled, as a result of strikes by assembly workers at Chicago-based Boeing Co. since early September.
"Ryanair is now assuming that these disruptions will continue until at least the end of October," the airline said in a 
statement.
Ryanair will slightly modify times for about 200 flights during October, representing less than 1 percent of Ryanair's 
total flights for that month, spokeswoman Pauline McAlester said. "But we don't envisage any cancellations," she 
added.
Because of the delay in the delivery of seven Boeing 737-800 aircraft, Ryanair said that three 737-200 planes, 
which have a smaller capacity, will remain in service until the end of October. They had been earmarked for 
retirement this month.
Assembly workers at Boeing's Seattle-based commercial jet plants are on strike over issues including pension 
increases and health care costs.

Body
Irish low-cost carrier, Ryanair, has been forced to modify its flight schedule this month and next because a strike at 
Boeing Company has delayed the delivery of some aircraft.
Seven planes were scheduled to be received in September and October but are now not expected to be delivered 
until November and December.
With Boeing having experienced work stoppages since early this month, Ryanair is conservatively assuming these 
disruptions will continue until at least the end of next month. Ryanair said approximately 200 flights, less than 1pc of 
its total, have been "amalgamated" during October.
 It reckons the financial impact will be immaterial. Three of the carrier's 737-200 series aircraft which were due to be 
retired this month will now continue in service until the end of October. Ryanair said new base launches in Liverpool 
and Pisa, scheduled to start on Sept 27 and Oct 10 respectively, will proceed with the airline using a new 737-800 
which was delivered by Boeing earlier this month and also utilising one of the three spare 800's for October.

Financier Dermot Desmond is said to be in advanced discussions to set up a low-cost airline to challenge Ryanair.
He is reported to be in talks with several Northern Ireland businessmen with regard to setting up the airline, which 
would challenge Ryanair on routes between Ireland and Continental Europe, according to a report in the Irish 
Independent.
Desmond is expected to emerge with 30pc of the company.
 In return, Desmond will put up much of the E30-E40m in start-up capital which the new airline will require. David 
Keys, the Northern Ireland property developer behind the planned venture, will also put up a substantial amount of 
the start-up equity and will retain 51pc of the company. The remaining 19pc will be split between a number of small 
investors and senior employees. The new airline is expected to be launched in November and will begin flying in 
June of next year.

Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, today again insisted it has no intention of introducing fuel surcharges.
"Ryanair will never apply a fuel surcharge, not now, not ever," chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
He accused British Airways, which earlier this month raised its fuel surcharge on longhaul flights to £60 per return 
trip, of "profiteering at passengers' expense".
 "BA has recently increased its fuel surcharge for a fifth time... despite the fact that back in August it confirmed to its 
shareholders that it had hedged 75pc of its fuel requirements for the rest of this year at USD43 a barrel. If BA is not 
paying the current higher oil prices, why is it still increasing fuel surcharges to passengers?," he asked.

Ryanair is expanding in the UK and Ireland by establishing new operating bases at Nottingham East Midlands and 
Cork airports.
The Irish carrier has the broadest presence across Europe of any airline with 15 bases in seven countries including 
Cork and East Midlands, which will open in November and March, respectively.
The move into East Midlands will take it into direct competition with EasyJet and BMIbaby, the low-cost arm of BMI 
British Midland, which both operate bases at the airport.
EMA, which is part of the Manchester airport group, will be the only airport in the UK where all three low-cost 
carriers operate competing bases, although initially there will be few overlaps in their respective routes.
Ryanair said it would base two aircraft at East Midlands and would add 10 routes to its existing network of five from 
the airport, including six to France, two to Poland and one each to Northern Ireland and Germany.
Unusually, most of the routes will only operate three or four times a week initially.
EasyJet currently bases three aircraft at East Midlands with nine routes, while BMIbaby has four aircraft and 12 
routes. The expansion will give Ryanair five bases in the UK including London Stansted and Luton, Glasgow 
Prestwick and Liverpool. In Ireland, it will have three bases including Dublin and Shannon.
However, the airline has suffered a setback in Germany where it has been forced to abandon its plan to establish a 
base in Lubeck, northern Germany, after a local court blocked plans to extend the runway at the airport.
Ryanair has forecast that it will increase passenger numbers by 27 per cent to 35m in the current year to March 
2006.

US airlines set for shake-up as Delta and Northwest file for bankruptcy
 US airlines set for shake-up as Delta and Northwest file for bankruptcy

Body
The US airline industry yesterday faced its biggest shake-out in a decade after Delta Air Lines and Northwest 
Airlines, the third- and fourth-largest carriers by revenue respectively, both filed for bankruptcy.
The bankruptcies - after four years of heavy losses and at least 120,000 job losses across the sector - are likely to 
accelerate an industry-wide restructuring around a low-cost model but could raise political pressure on the indebted 
federal agency that insures workers' pensions.
Four US airlines are now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, following earlier moves by United and US Airways - a 
recognition, analysts said, of the traditional carriers' inability to restore profitability and shed legacy costs in a 
unionised industry.
The bankruptcies threaten to widen dramatically the deficit faced by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation if 
both airlines opt to terminate their defined benefit pension plans.
In April, the federal agency, whose deficit hit Dollars 23.3bn (Pounds 12.8bn) in 2004, was forced to assume its 
largest pension termination, when United Airlines ended its defined benefit plans, transferring Dollars 6.6bn in 
liabilities. Initial estimates suggest that could be trumped by Delta, with Dollars 8.4bn in liabilities. Northwest's 
pension plan was underfunded by Dollars 3.8bn at the end of 2004.
Observers doubted that yesterday's bankruptcy filings would eliminate the overcapacity that has seen airlines lose 
pricing power as too many seats chase too few passengers. Analysts at Merrill Lynch estimate there are 100-200 
too many aircraft in the domestic network.
"The airline industry has changed permanently," said Doug Steenland, Northwest's president and chief executive 
officer. "Northwest must significantly lower its costs to compete with other carriers."
US airlines set for shake-up as Delta and Northwest file for bankruptcy
The carrier employs 40,000 staff. Mr Steenland said one trigger for the filing was that, after Hurricane Katrina, 
Northwest had been paying close to Dollars 100 a barrel for jet fuel - more than twice the amount it paid at the start 
of the year.
Northwest and Delta's decisions to go into Chapter 11 were likely to have been hastened by an October 17 
deadline when bankruptcy legislation comes into force that will give management far less room to manoeuvre than 
under the present regime.
Delta hopes to use bankruptcy protection to secure savings from its 52,000 employees.
Northwest, will rely on its cash balance of Dollars 1.4bn as of September 14 to see it through the process.
Delta has higher pension obligations than Northwest and its strategic position is viewed by analysts as weaker, 
prompting speculation that the two carriers could seek to exit bankruptcy together by merging.
"Delta's financial problems are severe, but by no means insurmountable," said Gerald Grinstein, chief executive.

Highlight: public funds to attract airlines
Body
The European Commission has published guidelines for publicly-owned airports to use funds to attract airlines, as 
the European Court of Justice (ECJ) looks likely to uphold the legality of new passenger compensation rules. The 
EC says the guidelines are intended to allow local governments in Europe to use public funds to attract low-fare 
airlines to their regional airports without breaching tough European anti-subsidy rules.
The guidelines were promised as part of the response to the ECJ ruling that Belgium's Walloon state had abused 
state aid rules in striking a deal with Irish carrier Ryanair to establish a base in Brussels South Charleroi airport. The 
guidelines state that funds "cannot be more than the task assigned", designed to allow airports to offer airlines 
marketing assistance, but not to use that description to cover other costs. The guidelines, which will be used by 
judges to assess future cases, also call for transparency and open tenders, and reinforce the 2 million passengers 
maximum annual limit set out in the ground-handling directive for competition in airport services. However, the EC 
says it encourages the growth of regional airports as a way to ease congestion at major hubs. Meanwhile, an initial 
opinion from the judges examining the legal challenge brought by the International Air Transport Association and 
the European Regions Airline Association has stated that the EC's passenger compensation rules are legal. The 
ECJ is expected to rule officially next week and is likely to confirm this view.Copyright 2005 Reed Business

Body
Passenger traffic at BAA's UK airports was depressed last month by the continuing impact of the July bombings in 
London and the disruption to British Airways flights associated with the industrial dispute at Gate Gourmet, BA's 
sole catering supplier at Heathrow.
Total passenger numbers at BAA's seven UK airports rose by 0.5 per cent to 14.3m for the month. This compares 
with the company's forecast for an increase of3.5 per cent in volumes at the three London airports, Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted in the 12 months to March 2006.
The main impact was felt at Heathrow, where traffic fell by 3 per cent year-on-year in August to 6.1m.
BA cancelled more than 700 flights to and from the airport during four days in mid-August, the peak of the summer 
season, stranding about 110,000 passengers around the world.
The airline said earlier this week it had suffered in August its first monthly decline in traffic volumes since April 2003.
BAA said its performance in all key areas in August had been below recent trends, with traffic volumes in the North 
Atlantic market falling by 1.3 per cent to 1.9m. However, traffic in other long-haul marketsrose by 4.9 per cent to 
2m.
The weakest performance was in the European charter market, where tour operators have been losing share 
steadily to low-cost airlines as consumers increasingly choose to organise their own holidays and book air travel 
and hotels separately.
Short-haul charter passenger volumes fell by 9.2 per cent year-on-year to 1.6m.
BAA said charter traffic at Gatwick, which accounted for about a third of passenger volumes at the airport, fell by 7 
per cent, but this had been offset by strong growth in European scheduled traffic.
Growth at Stansted, previously fuelled by the rapid expansion of the low-cost airlines, led by Ryanair and EasyJet, 
has slowed, as the airport increasingly suffers from capacity constraints at peak hours.

Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, today vowed that it would never levy fuel surcharges on tickets, however high crude 
oil prices rise.
The statement comes after British Airways yesterday said it was adding a further fuel surcharge to tickets on both 
long and short-haul flights as crude oil prices reached USD70 a barrel in the wake of the hurricane Katrina disaster.
Speaking this morning, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said Ryanair carried more passengers 
than British Airways' entire worldwide figure for the first time in the month of August, "and it is not hard to see why 
when British Airways is adding fuel surcharges of up to £60 for a return trip on top of their extortionately high fares".
 "Ryanair's guarantees no fuel surcharge, not now, not ever. Our four million free seat sale means that Ryanair 
passengers can get seats for free and never have to worry about fuel surcharges. This is why Ryanair has become 
the world's favourite airline and British Airways, the fuel surchargers, will always be the second choice," he added.

One advantage of travelling with Ryanair on a recent trip to Norway was the opportunity to read a book without 
interruptions for in-flight meals. The airline does not provide catering on its short-haul flights apart from selling 
snacks and drinks. This saves money on the ticket price.
I am quite capable of making a sandwich so have never understood the need for in-flight catering, even on relatively 
long flights. The ritual of removing plastic knives and forks from their little bags for the sake of consuming some 
rubbery scrambled egg and a sausage rarely seems worth the effort.
It is certainly not worth the kind of delays that ruined journeys for thousands of passengers last month when British 
Airways baggage handlers walked out in sympathy with striking workers at the London subsidiary of the in-flight 
catering company, Gate Gourmet.
To lose your flight because of technical problems is one thing, but to do so because of a lack of food is ridiculous. I 
heard of one executive complaining that, as a result of the dispute, he was given a single sandwich to tide him over 
a 22-hour journey to Australia.
Set against the plight of people in New Orleans last week I do not call this suffering.
But the airlines have encouraged their passengers, for various reasons, to subject themselves to nursery-style 
nannying dressed up as in-flight service. We press a button and someone brings us a glass of water or even 
champagne if our companies are prepared to stump up the premiums for travelling business class.
We have become accustomed to receiving the packaged aircraft meal which creates so much plastic junk that there 
is a real skill to keeping it all on your tray, and a real problem doing anything else before cabin staff clear it away. I 
have always regarded this ritual as more a form of control than a service.
But rather than overhaul the system, BA has followed the business re-engineering fashion for sorting the things it 
does in to two baskets: one for its important stuff, such as flying people places, and one for less important stuff. In 
business jargon that is "core" and "non-core".
The small step from outsourcing to out of control The BA -Gate Gourmet saga is a lesson to those wishing to 
board the contracting out bandwagon
Thus, Rod Eddington, chief executive of BA, explained in an open letter to staff that "we are an airline and not a 
catering company" and, therefore, would not be taking catering back in to a business that was intent on driving out 
"cost and complexity".
But how do you gauge the cost and complexity of dealing with 70,000 irate passengers who are unable to use one 
of the world's busiest airports because of a wildcat strike over planned redundancies at one of your suppliers?
BA did not have an alternative supplier. Gate Gourmet took over the whole catering operation that had been 
performed in-house up to 1997 and that is still physically based within the Heathrow community, providing 80,000 
airline meals a day.
The employers that are based at Heathrow may be tempted to forget sometimes, when they do their core/non-core 
assessments, that they are all members of an inter-dependent community.
Funnily enough, Heathrow employees seem to have a better understanding of this. A large proportion of the 
Heathrow employment community is of Asian origin, often bound together in strong family networks. It was this 
sense of solidarity that led baggage handlers to initially support the wildcat strike.
In spite of all the industrial relations legislation that was framed in order to curb the powers of trade unions, there 
remains little that can prevent spontaneous action of people with a grievance and all the injunctions in the world can 
do little to repair the damage that can result.
This is not the first industrial dispute at Heathrow during a peak holiday period. We can only guess how people may 
factor this in for the future. I do so already. I would far rather use a low-cost airline flying out of one of the smaller 
hubs.
The fashion for contracting out various services, now better known as outsourcing - another piece of business 
jargon - has become so entrenched that it has become a significant influence in the development of emerging 
economies.
But some companies are growing wary of transferring services outside where their only influence on employee 
relations and working conditions is the stipulations in their service contracts.
Indeed most of these stipulations tend to be related to maintaining levels of service rather than good rates of pay 
and sensible people management. Service providers tend to be left to sort those issues out for themselves. This is 
mooted as one attraction of taking the contract outside in the first place.
Meanwhile the contracting companies play what they consider to be the smart game of forcing competing suppliers 
to undercut each other. The big supermarkets have been doing this for years with the result that many small 
farmers are scarcely able to carry on their businesses.
But companies that divorce themselves from the employment concerns of their suppliers are taking a large risk.
Nick Starritt, a non-executive director of Northgate Information Solutions, created a revolution in employment 
services at BP a few years back when as the then director of human resources he was responsible for handing over 
many of the company's HR support functions to an outside supplier, Exult.
"It's important to do a risk assessment when you go down the outsourcing route so that you know what might 
happen if things go wrong. While there are clear attractions of having a single supplier it leaves you with no 
alternatives to mitigate the damage that can be caused by a strike," he says.
"We outsourced a whole bunch of activities to Exult but it did not all go smoothly and we did suffer some initial 
hiccups with the payroll. For the outsourcer it was like being given a computer programme without the code. The 
problem was consolidating a lot of separate in-house activities."
The small step from outsourcing to out of control The BA -Gate Gourmet saga is a lesson to those wishing to 
board the contracting out bandwagon
Mike Emmott, employee relations advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, believes that 
many of Gate Gourmet's problems stemmed from a clash of cultures as managers of the US-owned company 
struggled to rid the UK business of 1970s-style working practices.
These are issues for the company. But they are also issues that cannot be ignored by its airline customer.
"There are only so many things you can do, however, when you are not managing the employees yourself. How do 
you build up a relationship of loyalty and trust with staff you do not manage directly?" Mr Emmott says.
Recent research published by the UK's National Outsourcing Association highlighted fears among its membership 
that decisions by some companies to take some services back in-house were a growing trend. Cost saving will 
continue to balance such considerations.
In the meantime there needs to be some radical re-thinking around the notion of core and non-core.

Body
Low-cost Irish airline, Ryanair, has slammed the EU's guidelines out today which imposes restrictions on what 
public airports can offer to airlines to attract traffic.
Ryanair said the restrictions do not apply to privately-owned airports and so put the publicly-owned airports at a 
competitive disadvantage.
Ryanair said the Commission's guidelines are based on the legally flawed Charleroi decision, which is currently 
being appealed in the European Courts.
 Late last year, Ryanair agreed to repay E4m to the Walloon authorities over alleged subsidies for Charleroi Airport. 
The Commission ruled that some of the aid Ryanair received from the Belgian regional government to fly to 
Charleroi airport was illegal. The airline's chief, Michael O'Leary, this afternoon said the new guidelines are 
discriminatory.

Europe's boom in low cost air travel to regional airports should continue to be eligible for public subsidies, the 
European Commission will rule this week.
But there will be strict new guidelines on the payments of state aid, designed to create a level playing field for all 
airports and airlines.
The new rules were drawn up after last year's controversial decision by the Commission to demand that Ryanair, 
the Irish low-cost carrier, pay back millions of euros in subsidies it received from Charleroi airport, near Brussels.
Jacques Barrot, EU transport commissioner, wants to increase the use of regional airports and believes state aid 
can play a role. But he believes the rules should be clarified following the protracted battle with Ryanair, which 
portrayed itself as the victim of a clumsy Brussels assault on cheap air travel. The airline is appealing against the 
Commission decision.

Body
British Airways carried 3.9 percent fewer passengers in August, the airline said Monday, revealing the impact of last 
month's wildcat strikes by catering and baggage staff that forced it to cancel hundreds of flights.
The biggest impact was felt on its premium-class cabins where traffic fell by 4.7 percent, BA said, appearing to bear 
out analyst concerns that last month's strikes and the ongoing disruption to its onboard meal service would turn 
away the airline's core market of high-end customers.
Forward booking levels during August, however, were "quite reasonable," said George Stinnes, BA's head of 
investor relations.
"We haven't seen anything that would worry us," Stinnes said during a conference call Monday, but cautioned that 
booking volumes are generally quite low in August because it is the peak traveling season.
BA was forced to suspend all its flights for around 30 hours last month when a decision by its caterer Gate Gourmet 
Inc. to fire almost half its London staff touched off strikes by workers at both companies. Cargo operations were 
disrupted for a further 24 hours as the airline focused on getting its passenger planes into the skies.
BA has since agreed to a new deal with Gate Gourmet that offers better terms and a longer contract, but this has 
not yet been signed because the caterer is still locked in talks with unions to resolve the labor dispute.
BA has not yet put a figure on how much the industrial action will cost the airline, but analysts estimate it has 
already cost as much as 40 million pounds ($74US million; euro61.67 million). Stinnes acknowledged that such 
disruptions can have an impact on bookings over time.
BA's onboard meal service is still being affected by the dispute. Short haul flights have virtually no service with 
passengers being given vouchers to buy food at the airport.
The long haul flight service is more comprehensive with a range of hot meals and a full bar service due to resume 
Tuesday. However, specialist meals and other extra catering are not available.
British Airways : Passenger Numbers Down
BA's revelation that passenger numbers fell to 3.101 million in August came as Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings 
PLC, which is a rival to BA on European short-haul services, said it carried 3.257 million over the same period _ 
marking the first time it has carried more passengers than BA in a single month.
Stinnes said that British Airways PLC remains a larger airline in terms of revenue passenger kilometers (miles), 
which measures how far passengers are flown.
"We carry our passengers much further than Ryanair does," he said. "If you measure on RPKs we're a considerably 
larger airline."
BA added that record fuel prices and currency swings were making accurate profit forecasting more of a challenge 
than usual, but reiterated its forecast that total revenue for the year to March 2006 would grow in the range of 5.5 to 
6.5 per cent.
The company has now increased its fuel hedging cover for the rest of this financial year to 81 percent at an average 
cost of $45US a barrel. It previously had 75 percent hedged at $43US a barrel.
BA shares closed 0.3 percent higher at 280.75 pence ($5US.17; euro4.31) on the London Stock Exchange.

British Airways carried 3.9 percent fewer passengers in August, the airline said Monday, revealing the impact of last 
month's wildcat strikes by catering and baggage staff that forced it to cancel hundreds of flights.
The biggest impact was felt on its premium-class cabins where traffic fell by 4.7 percent, BA said, appearing to bear 
out analyst concerns that last month's strikes and the ongoing disruption to its onboard meal service would turn 
away the airline's core market of high-end customers.
Forward booking levels during August, however, were "quite reasonable," said George Stinnes, BA's head of 
investor relations.
"We haven't seen anything that would worry us," Stinnes said during a conference call Monday, but cautioned that 
booking volumes are generally quite low in August because it is the peak traveling season.
BA was forced to suspend all its flights for around 30 hours last month when a decision by its caterer Gate Gourmet 
Inc. to fire almost half its London staff touched off strikes by workers at both companies. Cargo operations were 
disrupted for a further 24 hours as the airline focused on getting its passenger planes into the skies.
BA has since agreed to a new deal with Gate Gourmet that offers better terms and a longer contract, but this has 
not yet been signed because the caterer is still locked in talks with unions to resolve the labor dispute.
BA has not yet put a figure on how much the industrial action will cost the airline, but analysts estimate it has 
already cost as much as 40 million pounds ($74 million). Stinnes acknowledged that such disruptions can have an 
impact on bookings over time.
BA's onboard meal service is still being affected by the dispute. Short haul flights have virtually no service with 
passengers being given vouchers to buy food at the airport.
The long haul flight service is more comprehensive with a range of hot meals and a full bar service due to resume 
Tuesday. However, specialist meals and other extra catering are not available.
British Airways : Passenger Numbers Drop
BA's revelation that passenger numbers fell to 3.101 million in August came as Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings 
PLC, which is a rival to BA on European short-haul services, said it carried 3.257 million over the same period _ 
marking the first time it has carried more passengers than BA in a single month.
Stinnes said that British Airways PLC remains a larger airline in terms of revenue passenger miles, which measures 
how far passengers are flown.
"We carry our passengers much further than Ryanair does," he said. "If you measure on RPKs we're a considerably 
larger airline."
BA added that record fuel prices and currency swings were making accurate profit forecasting more of a challenge 
than usual, but reiterated its forecast that total revenue for the year to March 2006 would grow in the range of 5.5 to 
6.5 per cent.
The company has now increased its fuel hedging cover for the rest of this financial year to 81 percent at an average 
cost of $45 a barrel. It previously had 75 percent hedged at $43 a barrel.
BA shares closed 0.3 percent higher at 280.75 pence ($5.17) on the London Stock Exchange.

Tom McKillop, the outgoing chief executive of AstraZeneca, has reportedly ruled out the chance of a merger with 
larger rival GlaxoSmithKline and the FTSE 100 closed higher as a slide in oil prices lifted sentiment.
While speaking at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Stockholm, McKillop told news agency Reuters 
that the group had no intention of entering merger talks with Glaxo.
Speculation that Astra (AZN) may merge with Glaxo (GSK) had been rife since the group announced that McKillop 
would be stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by David Brennan, the current head of the groups US 
operations.
Shares in Astra lost 15p to £25.93, while Citywire tip Glaxo jumped 9p to £13.52 after a study showed that its anti-
clot drug Arixtra is just as effective as Sanofi-Aventis' Lovenox and less likely to cause internal bleeding.
The FTSE 100 closed 11 points higher at 5,338 in a narrow trading margin. The FTSE 250 dipped four points to 
7,788 and the FTSE SmallCap eased two points to 3,133.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained seven points to 1,191.
US markets were closed today for Labor Day.
UK economic data showed that activity in the UK services sector dipped by a sharper-than-expected margin in 
August.
In micro news, British Airways (BAY) said that its August passenger traffic numbers fell by 0.7% in August following 
the crippling strike action by ground staff at Heathrow airport, which left more than 100,000 passengers stranded.
However, there was relief as the fuel-dependent UK flag carrier stuck to its full-year forecast despite the recent 
record in oil prices. Shares in the firm edged up a penny to 281p.
Rival Ryanair (RYA) climbed 0.125 cents to 6.705 after the budget airline said that August passenger numbers rose 
from 2.56 million in the same month last year to 3.25 million.
There was also some relief on the oil front for the duo today as members of the International Energy Agency 
released oil from strategic reserves after last weeks hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on oil refineries in the Gulf of 
Mexico.
Monday Closing Market: Astra dismisses Glaxo merger talk
London Brent futures contracts were trading $1.34 lower at $64.72 a barrel following the news.
Elsewhere, bid speculation supported some of biggest gainers on the FTSE 100.
Scottish Power was the top blue chip, jumping 21.5p to 546.5p as rumours that Germanys E.On was mulling a bid 
for the group persisted. Gas firm Centrica, which has also been touted a bid candidate, gained 3.5p to 253.75p.
The bid gossip in the utilities sector also attracted interest in National Grid, up 11.5p to 549p, Severn Trent, up 22p 
to £10.17, Kelda, up 14p to 704.5p, and Scottish and Southern Energy, up 18p to £10.15.
Meanwhile, Lloyds TSB improved 13p to 478.5p on continued hopes that US banking giant Wells Fargo will launch 
a bid for the group.
On the downside, a bearish note on the mining sector from Citigroup sparked tumbles in BHP Billiton, down 19p to 
822p, Rio Tinto, down 44p to £19.46, and Xstrata, down 17p to £13.13, while gaming group William Hill sunk 17.5p 
to 573.5p after its first-half numbers failed to impress. On the second line, Aggreko (AGK), which supplies 
temporary power, temperature control and compressed air systems, said that hurricane Katrina will initially have a 
disruptive impact on its North American business. 
However, the blow was cushioned by the groups prediction that the devastation caused by the storm would 
generate strong demand for its services in the months ahead. Shares in the group closed 3.25p lower at 215.25p, 
recovering from an earlier low of 211.25p.
On a brighter note, Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNN) topped the mid-cap leaderboard, advancing 7.25p to 206.25p after 
first-half numbers from the market research group came in ahead of expectations.
In the small-caps, Chrysalis (CHS) added a penny to 157.25p after the Office of Fair Trading cleared its acquisition 
of Century FM from Gcap Media.

EasyJet, one of the top two European low-cost airlines, has gone outside the aviation industry to appoint Andrew 
Harrison, previously chief executive of RAC, to head the airline.
He will replace Ray Webster as chief executive of the airline from December 1.
Mr Harrison was chief executive of the roadside assistance group prior to its Pounds 1.1bn acquisition this year by 
Aviva, Britain's biggest insurer.
EasyJet has expanded quickly since its launch 10 years ago and has succeeded in matching its rival Ryanair in 
size, carrying 28.7m passengers in the latest 12 months. But it has lagged the Irish low-cost carrier in profitability.
Sir Colin Chandler, EasyJet chairman, said improving the airline's profit margins would be one of the top priorities 
for the new chief executive.
Mr Harrison joined Lex Service in 1996 as chief executive and led its transformation from a vehicle distribution 
group into RAC plc.
EasyJet said yesterday that the successful integration of Lex and RAC had resulted in a strong rise in profit and a 
tripling of the share price during Mr Harrison's tenure.
The airline's share price has languished well below its 2000 flotation price for much of the past two years and only 
began to recover last autumn as the Icelandic raider FL Group, which includes Icelandair, the Icelandic flag carrier, 
began to build a stake, which has since risen to 13 per cent.
Sir Colin said EasyJet had assessed candidates across a wide range of industries as it searched for someone with 
senior management experience in "a large and well recognised consumer-facing plc".
He said that, at RAC, Mr Harrison had delivered "strong top- and bottom-line growth, improved cash generation, 
introduced cost efficiencies and inspired employees in a service industry".

Prior to joining Lex Service, Mr Harrison was an executive director of Courtaulds Textiles from 1990, responsible for 
its international fabrics and home furnishings businesses, having worked for the group since 1986. He is also a non-
executive director of Emap, the consumer publishing group.
Mr Webster will continue to work next year as a consultant reporting directly to the EasyJet chairman and working 
on special projects including the potential for franchising the EasyJet brand to low-cost airlines outside Europe.

Local departure tax leads airline to cut flights

Ryanair, the low-cost airline, is cutting almost half of its flights between London and Newquay in response to 
Cornwall County Council's decision to impose a tax of Pounds 5 per departing passenger.
The Irish carrier's launch, in April 2002, of services between London Stansted and Newquay was a driving force in a 
near tripling in passenger volumes at the Cornish airport from 118,000 in 2002 to a forecast 334,000 this year.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair deputy chief executive, said the council's "ridiculous" decision to introduce the levy would 
result in increased revenue of Pounds 250,000 but would cost the county income of Pounds 10.5m in terms of 
spending by visitors brought in by the airline.
"The benefits which incoming flights can deliver to regions such as Cornwall are incalculable and far exceed the 
derisory income, which will be derived by Cornwall as a result of this tax," he said.
Ryanair, which is famous for its ruthless negotiations with airports in Europe over landing and other charges, 
currently operates twice daily services between Stansted and Newquay. It said yesterday that it would cut all its 
morning flights except on Saturdays with effect from November 24, reducing its weekly schedule from 14 to eight 
return flights.
Mr Cawley said the increase in the cost of travel would lead to an "inevitable reduction in demand". More flights 
could be cut if demand deteriorated further.
He said Newquay and Cornwall were part of a "competitive price sensitive market that must compete with 84 other 
low-fare destinations in the Ryanair network from London Stansted".
He said under the right conditions the London market was capable of delivering "huge economic benefits" to 
Cornwall and more than 200,000 passengers a year.
Cornwall County Council said yesterday that it would look for another airline to take over the Ryanair flights. It was 
"currently talking to a number of other operators about expanding flights to and from Newquay".
Local departure tax leads airline to cut flights
Airsouthwest flies from Newquay to Dublin, Manchester, Bristol and Leeds/Bradford, while BMIbaby operates to 
Birmingham and Durham Tees Valley.
The council announced early last month that it planned to introduce a Pounds 5 fee on all departing passengers at 
Newquay over the age of 16, to finance development of the airport.
Andrew Mitchell, the council executive member for the economy, said the fee was "essential to the viability and 
future success of the airport". The council was investing Pounds 2.8m in expanding the airport.
The council maintained it could face "huge increases" in costs to run the airport because of the uncertainty facing 
Ministry of Defence operations there.
News of the reduction in Ryanair flights follows concern in Cornwall that rail services might deteriorate if the 
government cuts funding for sleeper trains between London and Penzance.
The franchise for FirstGroup, the bus and train operator, to run Great Western services expires in April and bidding 
is under way for a new, wider Greater Western franchise to replace it.

Ryanair today said it is to withdraw 12 flights per week at Newquay airport in the UK following the decision by

The budget airline will reduce its Newquay-London Stansted route to a single flight per day, and said the move

Michael Cawley, Deputy CEO of Ryanair, described the council's decision to levy the charge as "ridiculous" and

Budget carrier Tiger Airways said Monday that it hit the half-million passenger mark ahead of its first-year 
anniversary.
The 500,000th passenger flew from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on Monday, said the airline, which is 
an affiliate of Singapore Airlines Ltd.
Tiger, which competes against Jetstar Asia and Valuair in the domestic market, started commercial flights in 
September last year. The airline currently flies to Thailand, Vietnam, Macau, the Philippines and Indonesia.
In a statement, Chief Executive Tony Davis said Tiger owed its success partly to a strategy of using a single aircraft 
type, a focus on short flights and fast turnaround time, as well as a minimum of frills and in-flight services.
He said the methods were used by successful budget airlines such as Ryanair and Southwest Airlines.

Move over Polish plumber. The new icon of our times is the Polish dentist. Promising wonders such as "dentistry 
without pain during attractive vacation in mountains", dental agencies are luring customers from western Europe to 
have their teeth fixed in eastern Europe at a fraction of the cost they would pay for private treatment in their own 
countries.
Tellingly, many are focusing their efforts on the UK market. As all Americans know, Britons are famous for their bad 
teeth. This is due to the poor state of dentistry within the National Health Service. With many clinics no longer 
accepting new patients, only 39 per cent of adult Britons are registered with an NHS dentist.
Why wait in line or pay though the nose at home when you can get high quality service abroad at very attractive 
prices?
One agency cites fees of Pounds 14 to Pounds 31 for a filling, Pounds 21 to Pounds 42 for root canal work and 
Pounds 91 for a set of dentures. Provided there is adequate quality control - an essential task for the emerging 
industry - it is a no-brainer.
This is only the latest example of booming cross-border human services. South-east Asia, for instance, has long 
been notorious for sex tourism. But wealthy Asians now travel to Thailand and Singapore for treatment in private 
hospitals; entrepreneurs dream of providing retirement services to Japanese in the Philippines and elsewhere.
Many health services are now becoming traded goods. This is great news for the consumer. It should also prompt a 
rethink from governments. Rather than plough more money into the NHS to improve British dentistry, for instance, 
why not give patients a voucher and a Ryanair ticket to Poland?

Sir, Given that Tyler Brule's expectations about my country of origin (Fast Lane, FT Weekend, August 20-21) 
appear to have been set by watching 1950s films such as Darby O'Gill and the Little People, his disappointment 
that the Aer Lingus cabin crew did not perform a version of Riverdance or that there were no potatoes growing in 
the aisle is unsurprising. 
More modern references in future, please.
Furthermore, to experience a real Celtic Tiger airline success story he should fly with RyanAir. Naturally, this might 
mean mixing with what James Joyce called "the rabblement" - yes, more of that "illegible Irish poetry" that was 
written on the seat covers. This, of course, would be beneath him.

British Airways was among the first in the aviation industry to see outsourcing as a way to deal with the complexity 
and high cost of managing servicing and supplies. Its catering operation, the source of its recent woes, was sold in 
1997 to Gate Gourmet, then part of Swissair but now owned by Texas Pacific, the US buy-out group.
As long ago as 1991, BA had sold its jet engine maintenance facility in Wales to General Electric of the US. Its 
ground vehicle fleet was transferred six years later to Ryder, which provides vehicle management and maintenance 
services.
Low-cost start-up carriers around the world have chosen from the outset to use outside suppliers for services 
ranging from catering and maintenance to passenger and baggage handling. Ryanair, the leading European low-
cost carrier by passenger volumes, has gone further than most and disclosed last year that it was engaging up to 
30 per cent of its pilots on non-staff contracts and about the same proportion of cabin crew through outside 
agencies.
This month EasyJet, the UK budget airline, awarded a 10-year contract to the Swiss-based SR Technics for 
maintenance support following a competitive global tender. The deal, valued at Dollars 1bn (Pounds 556m, Euros 
816m), is one of the largest of its type. EasyJet says it expects to reduce its Airbus aircraft maintenance costs by 25 
per cent over the life of the contract, with savings of Pounds 10m next year alone. Many legacy carriers, struggling 
to lower their costs, have felt compelled to follow the example of the no-frills operators.
BA is far from alone in having outsourced inflight catering: with the exception of Continental Airlines, all the big US 
carriers and many in Europe have made the same move. Some have seen opportunities in pursuing a contrary 
strategy, however - among them Germany's Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines as well as Swissair before its 
financial collapse in 2001.
Lufthansa has developed as a broadly based aviation group and has considered services such as catering, 
maintenance, repair and overhaul, ground handling and package holiday tour operations as businesses to expand 
rather than divest, given the opportunity of serving other customers.
AIR TRAVEL Chicken or beef? As carriers get tough on costs, your meal or even your pilot can be bought in
But even Lufthansa has had a change of heart in recent years, partly because of big losses in some areas. It sold 
GlobeGround, the ground services group, in 2001 and has indicated that neither catering (LSG Sky Chefs) nor tour 
operating (Thomas Cook) are any longer considered core operations: those too could be shed. LSG Sky Chefs is 
the world's biggest inflight caterer, serving 270 airlines, but it has made losses in each of the past four years and 
has been a heavy burden on Lufthansa's financial performance.

The idea that in order to be successful a business must focus on its core competencies is one of the most often 
heard mantras in business today. Companies and government departments insist in their mission statements that 
they are "concentrating on their core competencies", as though an assertion of this devalued buzz phrase is a virtue 
in itself.
The idea is particularly, and invidiously, used as a justification for outsourcing, on the grounds that the business 
should concentrate on the few things that it does well and put the rest out to contract. But that is not what this 
statement means.
As originally proposed by C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel in their 1994 book Competing for the Future, "core 
competencies" were defined as those traits and attributes that make the company uniquely valuable to its 
customers, and therefore give it a basis for competitive advantage. BMW's core competency is the production of 
luxury cars; that of Ryanair is the provision of budget airline travel; that of eBay is the facilitation of an electronic 
marketplace where people can sell goods to each other. Core competencies are customer-defined, which can mean 
they are not necessarily the things that a company values about itself.
There are plenty of examples of companies that have successfully identified their core competencies. Particularly 
noteworthy is the recent resurgence of Apple Computer, which has got back in touch with its core competency, the 
production of stylish, user-friendly consumer electronics. The success of the iMac and the iPod suggests Apple 
knows where its competitive strengths lie. Conrad Hilton at Hilton Hotels, Ray Kroc at McDonald's and Herb 
Kelleher at Southwest Airlines are examples of leaders who used the core competencies concept to build strong, 
enduring businesses.
DAY EIGHTEEN: Sustain your company's heart MANAGEMENT SAYINGS: 'Focusing on core competencies' 
is more than a licence to outsource, says Morgen Witzel
In all three cases, thebusinesses used sophisticated management systems, but in none of these cases could those 
systems be described as the core competency. What made Hilton, McDonald's and Southwest Airlines strong 
companies was that consumers understood their product orservice offering, and liked it.
There are plenty of other examples of companies completely missing the point about core competencies. Some of 
these would be funny if they were not so tragic. Schwinn, a US manufacturer that was once one of the leaders in 
the world bicycle market, confused core competencies with high-value activities such as marketing. Technology and 
production were considered subordinate functions, and were outsourced to Taiwan. Schwinn lost control of the 
production of its own product and went bankrupt; the outsourcer, Giant Manufacturing Company of Taiwan, became 
the world's largest bicycle maker.
Further, focusing on core competencies does not have to mean downsizing. Some companies develop an approach 
to management that is easily transferable between industries, which means they are able to offer superior service 
or products to customers. EasyGroup, for example, uses a similar set of yield management methods in a variety of 
markets, ranging from cinemas to car rental to internet cafes, and, formerly, budget airlines.
The group's core competency, replicated in each sector, is its ability to use those methods to provide an 
inexpensive, no-frills product or service to budget-conscious consumers. Richard Branson's Virgin Group has also 
built on a standard core competency in markets ranging from airlines to music retailing.
At the simplest level, this adage is just another way of saying "in order to be successful, a business must focus on 
its customers". But there is more to it than that. By identifying what features customers most value and then striving 
to improve these, a business should be able to gain and maintain competitive advantage. And unless it can do so, 
then all the outsourcing in the world will not keep it alive.

Rather than sit back and enjoy the discomfiture of British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet have decided to have 
another of their little spats. 
Ryanair opened hostilities by calling attention to its rival's redesigned website, from whose new homepage weekly 
punctuality figures have disappeared.
EasyJet responded to what it called these "infantile babblings" by sending Ryanair a copy of Internet for Dummies.
Send one this way, too, then. EasyJet claims that the statistics are still available in "information packs" on its 
website but Mudlark can't find that phrase - or the punctuality figures - mentioned on the homepage or site map. 
This round goes to Ryanair.

Simon Evans, chief exec-utive of the Air Transport Users Council, the British organisation that represents airline 
passengers, is a busy man these days.
Since February, when new European Union compensation rules for airline passengers came into force, the number 
of complaints and queries received has increased fourfold.
"These rules have certainly raised expectations among passengers about what they can get if they have had a bad 
travel experience," he says.
But the EU legislation has also created an unprecedented legal quagmire, according to several airline executives 
and aviation authorities that are challenging the rules in court.
Some airlines also say the rules have left them with an unsustainable financial risk. Low-cost carriers in particular 
insist they could be forced to reimburse many times the actual price of a ticket.
The EU compensation scheme is not based on the actual ticket price but instead uses a complex rising scale for 
what passengers can claim for events such as flight delays.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, is among airlines that have so far resisted paying the new compensation 
claims. Jim Callaghan, its head of regulatory affairs, says the new rules are "a complete mess".
Ryanair, he says, recently had a family of five that paid a total of Euros 168 (Pounds 114) for their flight but were 
asking for compensation of Euros 1,980 following a cancellation due to weather. In another case a woman who paid 
Euros 46 for her flight was asking for Euros 400. "This is how insane the situation is," he said.
EU airlines count the cost of compensation confusion: New rules have led to a flood of claims from passengers, 
saysRaphael Minder in Brussels
Early next month, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, is expected to give 
an opinion on the rules, following challenges by the Inter-national Air Transport Association and the European Low 
Fares Airlines Association. Another organisation, the European Regions Airline Association (Era), has filed a 
complaint with the European ombudsman challenging Brussels' interpretation of the compensation rules and 
accusing the EU executive of distributing misleading and incorrect information about them.
Iata estimates applying the rules will cost EU airlines Euros 560m a year, over and above existing compensation. 
For a medium-sized European carrier that amounts to about Euros 40m a year - about a fifth of its operating profit - 
according to Iata's calculations.
But the burden will be heaviest for the smaller airlines and no-frill airlines that keep costs low by eliminating 
paperwork. Bigger airlines have the administrative capacity needed to cope with the rules, say analysts.
Part of the lawsuit by Iata and Elfaa focuses on whether the rules take the EU beyond its international obligations 
under the Montreal and Warsaw conventions on air transport. The amount of compensation offered for delays is at 
the centre of their concerns.
Mark Franklin, head of the aviation group at DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary, an Anglo-American law firm, says: 
"Airline legislation is supposed to be part of a uniform worldwide system and the EU has certainly changed a major 
part of it."
Although the rules were agreed by EU member states, several governments have been dragging their feet about 
transposing them into national law, pending the EU court's ruling.
As a result, Brussels last month started infringement procedures against six of them.
Following a drop in the number of airlines routinely overbooking flights, Brussels is hopeful the rules will provide an 
incentive for airlines to reduce delays and cancellations except where there are "extraordinary circumstances", such 
as the wildcat strike that left thousands of British Airways passengers stranded earlier this month.
Jacques Barrot, the EU's transport commissioner, has also argued that airlines should take advantage of the 
"better-quality image" provided by the legislation at a time when European passengers are becoming more litigious.
In the short term, lawyers stand to benefit. In the UK, the first court hearings on passenger claims relying on the 
new rules are expected by the end of the year. Several law firms, meanwhile, have been busy advising airlines on 
how to fend off hefty claims and turn the "extraordinary circumstances" exemption clause in the new rules to their 
advantage.
"We have had a steady flow of questions from airlines," says Mr Franklin. And there have been several small cases 
where people have sued airlines. He insists it is the "uncertainty and obscurity in the law that is the main source of 
why people come to us".

The Dublin market rose in early trading, helped by Elan shares, but volumes were very light.
At 10.20am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 32.90 points to 6701.34.
There was possibly a buoyant mood among early traders after yesterday's release of updated forecasts for 
economic growth by the Department of Finance yesterday that stood by earlier forecasts of 5pc plus growth for 
2005.
Other than that, there was little in the way of corporate news to excite investors. Ryanair announced this morning 
huge numbers of bookings for its new UK to Poland routes as Britons clamber to take advantage of cheaper dental 
fares available in that country. Shares rose 7c to 672. Among other general shares, Elan's rally continued, with 
shares up 23c to 685, while Eircom was up 1 to 173. C&C rose 8c to 420. The banks were mixed, with both AIB and 
Bank of Ireland fairly flat, while Anglo Irish dropped 10c to 1085 and Irish Life and Permanent was flat. In 
construction, CRH rose 15 to 2275, while Grafton climbed 10 to 893.

At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 25.59 points to 6691.91.
The banks were under pressure with AIB down 7c to 1783 on over 10 million traded, while the Bank of Ireland 
dropped 11 to 1299 on over 7 million traded. Press reports this morning said that An Post (the Irish Post Office) is in 
the process of seeking a banking partner to sell financial services products through its branch network.
On the second line, Anglo Irish was up a cent at 1086 while Irish Life and Permanent dropped 10 to 1475. There 
was little movement in Eircom shares, down 2c to 173, after its announcement that it had submitted its E420m bid 
for Meteor to the Competition Authority. Ryanair rose 3c to 668. In construction, CRH shares were doing a roaring

No-frills British airline and Ryanair's main European rival, easyJet, today said it has selected Zurich-based SR 
Technics for the total maintenance support, excluding engines, of the carrier's Airbus A319 fleet for a period of 10 
years.
The Luton-based airline said the deal, valued at USD1bn over the life of the contract, is one of the largest contracts 
ever awarded for maintenance of a single aircraft type.
EasyJet's A319 fleet is planned to rise from 54 aircraft today to a total of 120 aircraft by 2008.
"This 10-year deal provides easyJet with a reduction in Airbus maintenance costs, excluding engines, of greater 
than 25pc over the life of the contract and a saving of over £10m on maintenance costs for the coming financial 
year," said chief executive Ray Webster. SR Technics will continue to provide full support for easyJet's 55-strong 
Boeing 737 fleet. The deal announced today also includes an improvement to the terms of easyJet's existing 
contract for the maintenance of its 32 Boeing 737-700s.

Original Bullseye Baggies, the spirits in a sachet that Ryanair sells to passengers (Mudlark, July 12), are not the 
only such packets in the air. Customers of the Portuguese airlines TAP and Portugalia are already sampling similar 
delights produced by a Berkshire company, Sachet Systems. 
Others, including Britannia, KLM City Hopper, CSA and Malev, will try them soon.
These sachets, moreover, don't contain generic gin or vodka such as those sold on Ryanair. They hold branded 
spirits, including several produced by Whyte & Mackay. Simon Claxton, of Sachet Systems, says they cost 10 to 30 
per cent less than miniatures, not counting any saving on airline fuel.
If it gets really hot today, Mudlark's samples may be put to use - including the flashing shot glass that comes with 
the company's packet of four vodka shots.

Body
Ryanair has called for the implementation of a more efficient European air traffic control system that would reduce 
fuel burn, emissions, flight times and fares.
Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said the success of the "Open Skies" liberalisation of air traffic 
in Europe in 1997 could be repeated for European air traffic control.
This could be done, he said, by creating practical airspace blocks rather than national boundaries and creating 
competition for the provision of ATC services in each of these blocks.
"This would put an end to elongated and inefficient "W" shaped flight paths that often add 30pc onto the direct 
routes and generate efficiencies and cost reductions not available from existing state sponsored monopolies. "It 
would also reduce air fares for passengers and decrease the environmental impact of air travel more than any ill 
conceived aviation taxes ever could".

Although the London transport system bombings that killed 53 people on 7 July stopped some people flying, airport 
owner and operator BAA still handled a record number of passengers.
All together in July 14.6 million people used BAAs seven airports, which include Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, a 
year-on-year rise of 2.6%. This follows rises in the two previous months.
Gatwick and Stansted registered respective increases of 3.3% and 6.1%, but Heathrow traffic was 0.6% down to 
6.46 million passengers.
Growth was driven by the continuing success of budget airlines like Easyjet and Ryanair whose Michael OLeary last 
week said passenger figures were down for only a few days after Londons outbreak of terrorism.
He warned that if the terrorist problem increased markets could be affected. British Airways said the bombings had 
no material affect on traffic.
It seems that long queues, security cheques and continued congestion were at least as big a factor at Heathrow as 
suicide bombers. Heathrow will continue to struggle with demand until Terminal 5 opens; in the year to July it 
processed nearly 68 million. BAA shares lost 4.5p to 608.5p in light morning trading.
'The rate of growth at BAAs London airports was impacted by the London bombings,' the group said in a statement. 
'In addition, capacity constraints in this peak month reduced the ability of Heathrow to accommodate true demand 
growth.'
No-frills opportunities boosted traffic at BAAs Scottish airports by 5.8%. Southampton was up 30.8%.
'With the exception of the European charter market, all markets recorded gains on the previous year,' BAA added. 
'North Atlantic traffic increased 1.0%, other long haul increased 7.5%, Irish traffic added 8.0% and domestic traffic 
rose 1.4%. Traffic to European charter markets continued to decline, falling 5.5%.
Air transport movements increased 3.9% against the previous year while cargo volumes fell 2.7%.
Citywire Verdict: BAA shares (BAA) have climbed steadily from 547p a year ago. But since peaking at 636.5p in 
February they have underperformed. With the threat of small airlines going belly up with their dues unpaid, terrorism 
fears and constantly escalating fuel charges, look elsewhere.

Low-cost airline and Ryanair's main European rival, easyJet, today quoted Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) figures to

EasyJet said Aer Lingus' market share has fallen on both the routes it competes with easyJet from London - to Cork

The latest CAA figures show that easyJet has acquired significant market shares on its three routes from London

* First-quarter profits up 65%
* Premium traffic raises average fare level
* Low-cost peer EasyJet revises profit guidance upwards
British Airways yesterday announced its best first-quarter profits for eight years and EasyJet, the leading UK low-
cost carrier, also raised its profit guidance, strengthening investor confidence in the improving fortunes of European 
airlines.
Rising demand for air travel is helping many airlines offset the big increase in fuel costs. BA is benefiting in 
particular from the rising number of passengers travelling long haul in its lucrative business class cabins, the main 
engine for profits growth at the UK flag carrier.
BA's figures were the last before Sir Rod Eddington is replaced as chief executive next month by Willie Walsh, the 
former chief executive of Ireland's Aer Lingus.
BA increased pre-tax profits in the three months from April to June by a better-than-expected 65 per cent, from 
Pounds 75m to Pounds 124m. Its latest traffic data show that the strong upward trend is continuing during the 
summer.
The airline's total traffic in July rose by 4.2 per cent, but premium traffic - in business and first class - grew by 6.9 
per cent year-on-year following an 8.6 per cent rise in June. BA filled 81.1 per cent of its available seats in July, a 
record for the month.
Its yields or average fare levels, excluding fuel surcharges on ticket prices, rose by 1.5 per cent thanks to the rise in 
premium traffic, the first quarterly increase in yields since the industry plunged into recession in the wake of the 
September 11 terrorist attacks in the US in 2001.
BA reports best results in 8 years
Both BA and EasyJet, two of the biggest airlines in the London market, said that last month's bomb attacks had not 
yet had a material impact on their businesses.
Sir Rod said it was too early to say what the long-term impact would be.
Ray Webster, the EasyJet chief executive who is also due to retire as soon as a successor is appointed, said the 
bombings had affected demand for inbound travel to London but were not expected to hit the group's full-year 
results.
EasyJet in May warned that rising fuel costs caused by the record oil price would mean a drop in profits for its 
financial year to the end of September.
But yesterday Mr Webster revised the guidance on the strength of the group's improving revenues and said 
reported pre-tax profits should now be "broadly in line with last year".
Earlier this week Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, announced a 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to a 
record Euros 76.9m (Pounds 53.49m) in its first quarter.
The EasyJet share price rose 14 1/4p, or 5.7 per cent, to close at 265 1/4p. BA closed 4 1/2p lower, or 1.6 per cent, 
at 286p. Lex, Page 16 Buoyant farewell, Page M2
