 Hamburg, Germany, March 22, 2014 --(PR.com[1])-- Regarding these alternatives, yStats.com analyst Tatiana 
Teplova states 'alternative payment methods such as E-Wallets, online banking and mobile payment are on the 
rise, and the digital currency Bitcoin is also accepted by some online travel agencies.'
Global developments in online payments for online travel
One general trend in online travel is the increasing use of mobile devices to make reservations, especially by 
business travelers and consumers who book last minute trips. With the increasing use of smartphones and tablet 
computers for travel planning, payment methods have to adapt to the emerging trend in consumer practice. A third 
of airlines already plan to facilitate the use of mobile payments for booking purposes in the next two years. PayPal 
is already accepted by an increasing number of travel booking websites.
Online payment fraud is a major concern of online travel agencies and booking websites. Though only around 1% 
of online travel payments is fraudulent, considering the size of the market, this is a significant number. Industry 
compliance with established safety regulations and keeping consumers informed about secure payment can 
contribute to decreasing the occurrence and cost of payment fraud.
Another trend on the online travel payments is towards immediate payment at the time of booking of hotels. Though 
both prepayment and reservation held by card for later payment at the desk are present on such travel booking 
websites as Booking.com and Expedia.com, on other such as on Hotels.com pre-payment has become the 
dominant option.
Regional variations in online payment for flights and lodging
Though online travel is a global market, peculiarities of local payment environments influence travel payment 
practice. For example, budget airline Ryanair accepts direct debits on its website in Germany, where they are 
popular, and does not take surcharges on them. Online travel booking website Hotelurbano.com, for which the 
primary market is Brazil, accepts the local banking payment method Boleto Bancario, while Japan-based All Nippon 
Airways accepts cash payment at convenience stores, which is an accepted payment practice in Japan. US airline

companies United Airlines and Delta Air Lines offer the delayed payment method Bill Me Later, a PayPal brand, for 
customers with a billing addresses in the USA.

 The world is a big place - there are over 190 countries and 7 billion people in the world, which really boggles the 
mind if you sit down and think about it. In addition to being an interesting intellectual exercise, this fact can also 
have broad implications for your investments and your financial future. It is easy to stay focused on U.S. firms, 
news, and events during the day-to-day grind, but it is always important to be aware of your surroundings - 
especially when it comes to your investments. With that in mind, this series of articles will focus on countries and 
investment opportunities outside the United States that you might not usually hear about.
 As always, be sure to consult a financial services professional familiar with both the potential investment and your 
unique financial situation before embarking on any investment program.
 Note: this piece was first posted in October 2013 and has been updated.
 Ireland
 Update: Since the initial writing of this post, there have been several news stories about the Irish economy that are 
market-moving. The recovery of the Irish financial sector, especially the Bank of Ireland, has led private equity giant 
Wilbur Ross to begin selling off some of his position. Additionally, Ryanair, an Irish air carrier, is poised to 
potentially double traffic due to several newly-inked deals. Lastly, Chiquita purchased the Irish fruit distributor Fyffes 
- the deal creates the largest banana distributor in the world.
 ——-
 When Ireland comes to mind, some of the more common things that are thought of are Guinness, St. James 
Brewery, and St. Patrick's Day. The Irish have a rich and vibrant history that still has a powerful influence on the 
country, government, and economy today. If, however, the analysis of the Irish ended with that cursory overview, a 
large number of possible reasons to invest in Ireland would be overlooked. Once dubbed the 'Celtic Tiger,' the Irish 
economy was hit especially hard during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. By taking stringent economic measures 
and restructuring its largest financial institutions, the Irish economy has begun to rebound and to attract significant 
FDI once again.
 Ireland has many facets that make it an attractive potential international investment. The nation has invested 
massive amounts of both financial and intellectual capital to turn itself into a tech-friendly hub, and the results speak 
for themselves. Boston Scientific, Microsoft, IBM, Google, Facebook, and EA are just a handful of the tech giants 
that have significant operations located in Ireland. As a member of the eurozone, goods, services, and personnel 
can flow freely between Ireland the world's most valuable market, the Eurozone. Ireland has been named the most 
Globalized Western economy, as well as being ranked 13th in the world in the Global Innovation Index. Last but not 
International Investing - Ireland
least, the extremely low tax rates offered by Ireland make it extremely appealing for international corporations who 
wish to minimize their tax liabilities.
 When looking at investing in Ireland, there are two primary ways to go about it - ADRs or direct purchases. An ADR 
is basically a certificate held by a U.S. banking institution that represents a certain number of shares in the foreign 
company, and is held by the U.S. institution. This helps to cut down on the administrative fees and other costs that 
would otherwise be incurred. For more direct exposure, you can also purchase shares directly from Irish stock 
exchanges if your broker offers those services to its retail investor base (you and me).
 Some of the more popular and well known Irish ADR's are Elan (ELN), which is a major pharmaceutical firm that is 
based in Dublin, with major interests in the United States. The Bank of Ireland (IRE) is the nation's largest financial 
institution, and Ryanair (RYAAY) is Ireland's best-known provider of air transportation. The largest and best-known 
Irish ETF is iShares MSCI Ireland Capped Index (EIRL), which, like several other country-specific ETFs, has a 
smaller exposure to the financial sector.
 As always, I have attached some links with more information

Q35i0MebZ48/Ux9TDkTMoeI/AAAAAAAAAJA/0fbDHqisUrc/s1600/download.jpgHere's a knotty case. Not quite 
copyright, but eiusdem generis enough to be of interest to readers of this blog.
This blogger has only just become aware of case number C-30/14 with which the CJEU has been seized since 22 
January, as fully reported in January in the astonishingly brilliant EU Law Radar Blog here[1].
In it, the Dutch Supreme Court has asked the CJEU to opine on the compatibility of Dutch copyright/database rights 
law with the European law acquis as well as the question as to whether contractual restrictions (in Ryanair's terms 
of use) can trump the lawful user exception under the Database Directive.
PR Aviation, the operators of a website wegolo.com [we go low - geddit?] run an airline comparison site. They allow 
users to search across multiple airlines, including Ryanair - and Ryanair, not being happy about this, sued PR 
Aviation. Note that this does not seem to be a case of scraping - as the Dutch lower court found an allegation of 
scraping not to have been proved.
The Dutch courts appear to have found that the Ryanair booking system was protected neither by copyright nor by 
the sui generis rights under the Database Directive but it is protected as a database under an arcane provision of 
the Dutch Copyright Act of 1912 which the Dutch parliament expressly legislated to survive the implementation of 
the Database Directive, even though it affords protection to content that is unprotectable under that Directive.
The Dutch Supreme Court then looked at the Directive and said that, even if the 1912 law was compatible with the 
Directive (a point about which there is considerable doubt - as even the court was willing to admit), then the rights of 
lawful users under Articles 6 and 8 of the Database Directive and, importantly, the prohibition on contractual 
override under Article 15 of the Directive as a matter of principle also apply to protect users of the databases that 
are not protected by the Directive. So the Dutch court's approach seems to be that the exceptions set out in the 
Directive apply to a broad range of databases, even beyond those which are granted IP protection by the Directive.
They therefore asked the CJEU the following question (and thanks to EU Law Radar[2]'s Stephen Vousden for the 
informal translation) Does the scope of the Database Directive also cover online databases that are neither 
protected in copyright under Chapter II of the Directive nor protected as a sui generis right under Chapter III of the 
Directive and yet where the freedom to use such databases cannot be restricted in contract by dint of the (whether 
or not corresponding) application of Articles 6(1) and Article 8, when read together with Article 15 of the Database 
Directive?This Blogger would suggest the answer that (i) after SportRadar [3] and Svensson[4] the Court will find 
Database Rights, Dutch Law, Contract Law and Ryanair
that the continued protection of rights that are not contemplated under the Database Directive is not compatible with 
the harmonisation principle of the Directive but that (ii) a Member State court should therefore not in any event deny 
the protection of Article 15 to a user of a database, regardless of whether that Directive is protected under the 
Directive, or under separate legislation incompatible with the Directive. It seems rather unlikely that the Court will 
rule that the proper construction of the Directive is that Article 15 applies to all databases, whether protected under 
the Directive or otherwise - but anything is possible.

announces the addition of Travel and Tourism in Morocco to 2017[2] market report to its offering
 The Moroccan travel and tourism sector registered slow growth during the review period (20082012), due to the

will develop the tourism sector over the forecast period (20132017).

tourism sector.
 Understand the demand-side dynamics within the Moroccan travel and tourism sector, along with key market 
trends and growth opportunities.
Key Highlights
In June 2013, the Ministry of Tourism launched the new edition of the Kounouz Biladi program to promote domestic 
tourism. Kounouz Biladi targets middle-class families who do not allocate budgets for trips. The ministry announced 
appealing prices and travel agencies provided attractive packages similar to those offered to international tourists 
during the 2012 edition of the program. The ministry also announced that Kounouz Biladi will be extended to other 
seasons to enable domestic tourists to benefit from discounts throughout the year. 
Travel and Tourism in Morocco to 2017
In July 2013, the tourism board increased its focus on countries such as China, Russia, Eastern Europe, North 
America and the Middle East to promote Morocco as an attractive tourist destination. The Moroccan National 
Tourist Office has already set up offices in Beijing and launched a promotion plan aiming to attract Chinese tourists. 
The office has also requested airlines in both Morocco and China to fly direct flights between the two countries.
In June 2013, Royal Air Maroc announced that it will purchase 20 to 30 new aircraft by 2020, including five long-
haul aircraft. British Airways had increased the number of flights from seven to 10 between November 2012 to 
March 2013 between Marrakech and London. In April 2013, Ryanair has also renewed its long-term interest in the 
country by adding two bases in Marrakesh and Fez, increasing its Moroccan operations to 60 routes and eight 
airports, transporting 2.5 million passengers a year to the country.
Premium and high-end luxury hotel brands, such as Mandarin Oriental, Oberoi, The Address Hotels, Rocco Forte 
Collection and Kempinski, have started investing in new properties in the country; 54 hotel projects are planned with 
a total of 15,000 new guest rooms. Among these, 18 five-star hotels will be built in Marrakech. Kempinski is also 
planning two new properties in the country. The Royal Palace hotel, with 260 rooms, opened in Agadir in March 
2013, and in October 2013, the 270-room Al Houara hotel opened in Tanger. 
The cost of renting a basic car with no restrictions on travel distance starts from MAD3,408.2 (US$395.0) per week 
or MAD491.8 (US$57.0) per day. This is very expensive for a North African country. Most car rental companies also 
demand a refundable cash deposit of MAD2,934.7 (US$340.0) or MAD4,875.0 (US$565.0) if not paid by a credit 
card. The best cities to hire cars in are Casablanca, Marrakesh and Tangier, where cars are available at 
competitive prices.
Moroccan travel agencies are capitalizing on domestic audiences through online advertising campaigns, and all 
travel packages booked through them are subject to a 15% discount. Domestic tourists can also access an 
interlocutor if they are dissatisfied with the travel agencys services.

Key Highlights
In June 2013, the Ministry of Tourism launched the new edition of the Kounouz Biladi program to promote domestic 
tourism. Kounouz Biladi targets middle-class families who do not allocate budgets for trips. The ministry announced 
appealing prices and travel agencies provided attractive packages similar to those offered to international tourists 
during the 2012 edition of the program. The ministry also announced that Kounouz Biladi will be extended to other 
seasons to enable domestic tourists to benefit from discounts throughout the year.
In July 2013, the tourism board increased its focus on countries such as China, Russia, Eastern Europe, North 
America and the Middle East to promote Morocco as an attractive tourist destination. The Moroccan National 
Tourist Office has already set up offices in Beijing and launched a promotion plan aiming to attract Chinese tourists. 
The office has also requested airlines in both Morocco and China to fly direct flights between the two countries.
In June 2013, Royal Air Maroc announced that it will purchase 20 to 30 new aircraft by 2020, including five long-
haul aircraft. British Airways had increased the number of flights from seven to 10 between November 2012 to 
March 2013 between Marrakech and London. In April 2013, Ryanair has also renewed its long-term interest in the 
country by adding two bases in Marrakesh and Fez, increasing its Moroccan operations to 60 routes and eight 
airports, transporting 2.5 million passengers a year to the country.
Premium and high-end luxury hotel brands, such as Mandarin Oriental, Oberoi, The Address Hotels, Rocco Forte 
Collection and Kempinski, have started investing in new properties in the country; 54 hotel projects are planned with 
a total of 15,000 new guest rooms. Among these, 18 five-star hotels will be built in Marrakech. Kempinski is also 
planning two new properties in the country. The Royal Palace hotel, with 260 rooms, opened in Agadir in March 
2013, and in October 2013, the 270-room Al Houara hotel opened in Tanger.
The cost of renting a basic car with no restrictions on travel distance starts from MAD3,408.2 (US$395.0) per week 
or MAD491.8 (US$57.0) per day. This is very expensive for a North African country. Most car rental companies also 
demand a refundable cash deposit of MAD2,934.7 (US$340.0) or MAD4,875.0 (US$565.0) if not paid by a credit 
card. The best cities to hire cars in are Casablanca, Marrakesh and Tangier, where cars are available at 
competitive prices.
Moroccan travel agencies are capitalizing on domestic audiences through online advertising campaigns, and all 
travel packages booked through them are subject to a 15% discount. Domestic tourists can also access an 
interlocutor if they are dissatisfied with the travel agency's services.

Ryanair Plans To Offer Transatlantic Flights For Less Than £10
Ryanair Plans To Offer Transatlantic Flights For Less Than £10

 Even for Ryanair, this is too crazy to be true. 
 Ryanair[1], the love-to-hate Irish airline, hopes to offer transatlantic flights at crazy low prices one day. 
 According to the Telegraph[2], Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the Irish Hotels Federation conference 
Tuesday that his airline would offer tickets to New York and Boston for €10 (that's £8.26 or $13.81). Flights back to 
Europe would cost €7.30 (£6.03 or $10.08).
 These insanely cheap flights won't happen, however, until Ryanair acquires the long-haul aircrafts necessary to 
make the flights. And that could take up to five years. 
 O'Leary also admitted that extra fees would apply, charging passengers for everything from luggage to meals. 
Business and first-class seats would also be an additional cost.
 "We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe,' O'Leary added. 'Not every seat will be €10 of course, there will 
also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.'
 In October, Norwegian[3], another budget airline, announced they will be offering transatlantic flights at low -- but 
not £10 low -- prices. Norwegian's transatlantic flights start around $240 one way, which is still pretty cheap for a 
flight across the ocean. 
 Ryanair's plan seems pretty far fetched... But if they do get those planes one day, would you fly Ryanair long-haul?

 Freddie Laker carries his father with him everywhere he goes. He bears him on his back, cloaked in a thick brown 
bomber jacket from the 1970′s, a relic of Freddie Laker Senior's wardrobe. He hauls him in the form of a giant

He wears him in the shape of a tattoo, the Laker airlines logo branded on his right shoulder. 'For such a jackass, I'm 
quite sentimental,' Laker admits. Laker Jr. was raised in his father's entrepreneurial shadow, growing up with riches 
as a result of his family's dynasty. Laker Sr. founded British-based Laker Airways, the first low-cost transatlantic 
airline. It was an idea before its time, one that predated and provided the foundation for those that came after, like 
Southwest and Ryanair. It eventually went bankrupt, following the early 1980s recession. Nonetheless, it made 
Laker Sr. enormously wealthy and famous, and earned him a knighthood in the 1970s. Laker Jr. might be best 
described as a son-trepreneur, a businessman who inherited his father's taste for risk taking, particularly the 
sadomasochistic love of company creating. He's not alone, we can look to Chris Ovitz and Ben Lerer for other 
examples. But Freddie Laker's is a particularly poignant story. Sitting in the Pando offices, Laker Jr. flips through a 
big, mahogany album. In it, page upon page[2] are covered in tiny, precise handwriting, logging the date, flight 
number, commander, aircraft type, and destination for every journey Laker Jr. has ever taken by plane. He points to 
the very first entry. 'My first flight was at age three months,' Laker says shaking his head. He's taken 1,300 flights, 
and made 180 transatlantic crossings. From his birth, Laker Jr.'s father was preparing him to run an aviation 
company. At ten years old Sr. started teaching Jr. how to read financials, do operational planning, and understand 
every job at an airline. As Laker Jr. grew older, the two started butting heads. Laker Jr. wanted to work with 
computers, having tooled around as a child with the Apple IIc Laker Sr. had in his office. 'He didn't know how to use 
it,' Laker Jr. remembers. 'But Apple had him pose in the ad, 'Big decision makers use Apple IIC.'' Given that few 
universities were offering computer programming or hardware classes in the mid nineties, Laker Jr. saw no point in 
going to college. He dropped out of school after a few months, and was living the good life off his father's dime, in 
Laker Sr.'s Miami home. The tension between them inevitably came to a head, and Laker Sr. cut Laker Jr. off from 
his steep monthly allowance. 'I was being a spoiled asshat, and he wanted to reality check me,' Laker says. The 
moment is permanently seared in Laker Jr.'s mind: I was sitting in his office at Laker Airways. My dad came from 
nothing, a one bedroom house, his mother delivered coal and sold apples off her back kind of thing. He said, 'I think 
you're going down the wrong path. I tried to give you all the stuff I had but I didn't do it right.' He said, 'I want you to 
'I've fucked up things you haven't even thought of yet': The entrepreneurial son with everything to prove
experience life the right way.' I'll never forget, he said, 'You're going to hate me for it but you'll thank me one day.' I 
remember I did thank him a few years later. It was the best thing anyone has ever done for me. Laker Jr.'s life 
changed dramatically after that moment. He moved into his girlfriend's apartment in Pembroke Pines, then a rough 
part of Florida, and started trying to learn how to balance his own meager budget. More often than not he'd spend 
his entire month's money in a few days time and wind up borrowing cash from friends. It was an uphill battle, but 
slowly and surely Laker Jr. learned to live life like the 99 percent. If you think about what an entrepreneur is, one 
side is being dynamic and not being afraid of failure, a willingness to go for it. But the other side is — there's this 
great quote, 'There's no such thing as a lack of resources, there's just a lack of resourcefulness.' I had never been 
forced to be resourceful: All of a sudden I became scrappy. Finally, Laker Sr. offered Laker Jr. a job, working for 
pennies, hand transcribing documents as a records clerk for the airline ('to teach me humility'). Laker Jr. worked his 
way up into a self-created, higher position as the Laker Airways network administrator and on hand IT guy, but still 
making next to no money. Meanwhile, he started moonlighting at night as a DJ for The Womb, a popular pirate 
radio station in Miami. What came next was a bit of a convoluted turn of events, the sort that would change the 
course of Laker Jr.'s life even if at the time its significance couldn't be seen. The Federal Communications 
Commission tried to shut The Womb down for operating illegally. Laker Jr. came up with the idea to push the 
station's signal partly online, with software (built by Laker Jr.) that bounced the signal between two transmitters in 
different parts of town. The ploy confused the FCC for five months. 'We were using the Internet to fuck these guys 
around,' Laker remembers. Bear in mind, this was the mid nineties. Internet radio wasn't a big thing yet and 
Pandora and Spotify were mere twinkles in their founders' eyes. When the FCC finally caught The Womb and shut 
it down, the story was big news, making the front of the Miami Herald among other outlets. Soon after Laker Jr. got 
a call from Rolling Stone magazine. 'They said, 'You guys were one of the first 24-hour-a-day Internet radio stations 
and we want to interview you,' Laker remembers. He mimed covering a phone with his hand, 'I literally turned to 
Duncan [his co-worker at The Womb] and said, 'Hey did you know we were one of the first 24-hour-a-day radio 
stations?'' Following the Rolling Stone interview, it didn't take long for the phone to start ringing off the hook. People 
got wind that Laker 'was the guy who could do Internet stuff' after the magazine's feature. He was 19. Laker did 
next what any ambitious person would. He used his new found business leads as a bargaining chip. He asked his 
dad for a raise. 'I said, 'Can you please pay me $26,000? If I leave you're going to have to hire a network guy and it 
will cost even more,'' Laker says. His father refused ('He was still trying to tough love me') and Laker quit to start his 
own Internet Service Provider company selling dial-up modems — aptly named Laker.net. As a cheeky maneuver, 
he rented an office space in the same building as the Laker Airways office in Miami. It was the move that would 
permanently take Laker Jr. off the path of his manifest airline destiny and set him on his own entrepreneurial 
course. He built out Laker.net, eventually even bringing on Laker Airways as one of 15,000 clients. After seven 
years he merged the company with a different one, a business deal that went over horribly wrong and destroyed 
Laker.net. 'I was starting to become the person my dad had described himself as, where I'm the guy who's fucked 
up things others haven't even thought of yet,' Laker says ruefully. 'I'm accumulating these experiences, and it's OK.' 
In true entrepreneurial form, he immediately started another venture, a digital advertising company called 
iChameleon, taking some of his former clients with him. This one went a little more smoothly, and the agency slowly 
started gathering acclaim for its viral marketing stunts. Eventually, Laker believes, Laker Sr. came to accept and 
feel proud of the alternative, non-aviation route his son had taken. 'When iChameleon got a 10,000 square foot 
office,' Laker says. 'It was big — like his offices. He saw it packed full of people, and then he was like, 'Alright. Rock 
on.'' Laker Jr. eventually sold iChameleon to Sapient, at the time the largest independent digital agency in the 
world. He stayed on for another four years and rose through the ranks to become a VP. He loved it, but eventually 
got restless. He came up with an idea for a video production startup, and his advertising agency invested in him. 'To 
the best of my knowledge they've never done [that] for anyone else in the 23 years of Sapient's history,' Laker says. 
The company, called Guide[3], became Laker's full-time work. His team built technology that could turn a print 
article into a video[4] almost automatically, by semantically analyzing the key terms of the story and pulling images 
from stock photo agencies. It's the most startup-y venture Laker Jr. has undertaken so far, and he says he has big 
dreams for it. Between the logbook and the constant stories of battling to gain his father's approval, it's clear what 
drives much of Laker's determination to succeed. 'My whole life, I'd always be introduced to people as, 'Oh you're 
Freddie Laker's son,'' Laker Jr. says, smiling. 'My ambition was that at some point he would start introducing himself 
as Freddie Laker's father. I don't think he ever saw that day though.' (Laker Sr. passed away[5] in 2006, at the age 
of 83.) The sentiment mirrors what Ben Lerer told[6] Sarah Lacy at PandoMonthly in August 2012. He started 
Thrillist to prove he was more than his last name. 'The reason I think I've been successful has actually 
'I've fucked up things you haven't even thought of yet': The entrepreneurial son with everything to prove
been…through insecurity,' says Lerer. 'I don't want to be some guy that people look at and say 'eh, he works with 
his dad.'' 
 Likewise, Laker homes that Guide Laker could finally be the company which takes him out of his father's shadow 
and introduces the name Freddie Laker to an entirely new generation, as a byword for massive success as 
opposed to bold, but ultimately foiled, business ideas. That burning ambition, that legacy and — yes — the fact that 
when you meet Freddie Laker Jr. you really, really root for him to succeed, made the email I received last week, as I 
was still working on my profile of Guide, all the more heartbreaking. Laker Jr. wrote: Guide failed to find its funding. 
I've decided to pack it in. I made up my mind on Monday that I just can't finance the company any more while I 
waited for investors to come through for me. It's quite depressing to put it mildly. I think I'm in a state of shock that 
we couldn't pull it off in time. Absent a last ditch savior, Guide, Freddie Laker's third startup, will likely close its doors 
in the next few days. It seems unlikely, however, that Laker Jr. himself will be brought down to earth for long. I 
always think back to my the advice my father gave me when he said 'I've fucked up things you haven't even thought 
of yet…' I'm 36 now and still 35 years younger than [his age] when he said that to me. I'm sure I'll have some more 
successes and I'm sure I'll have some more failures whether that's as an entrepreneur or in the corporate world. 
Either way I'll continue to strive to have the courage to not sit on the sidelines when I see a challenge I want to take 
on.

 The European Commission adopted new guidelines for state aid to European airports and airlines, to promote 
good connections between regions and boost mobility of European citizens.
 The key features of the new guidelines for state aid to European airports and airlines are: (i) Investment in airport 
infrastructure will be allowed if there is a genuine transport need and the necessary public support; (ii) Operating aid 
to regional airports with less than 3 million passengers a year will be allowed for a transitional period of 10 years 
under certain conditions; (iii) and Start-up state aid to airlines to launch a new air route will be permitted provided it 
remains limited in time. 
 European Commissioner for Competition policy Joaquín Almunia said about the new guidelines, 'the new state aid 
guidelines are a key ingredient for a successful and competitive European aviation industry. They will ensure fair 
competition regardless of the business model - from flag carriers to low-cost airlines and from regional airports to 
major hubs. Our aim is to ensure the mobility of citizens, while preserving a level playing field between airports and 
airlines.'
 Besides the announcement for the new guidelines on state aid to European airports and airlines, the European 
Commission announced four different decisions in regard with EU's air transport sector. First, Commission 
approved the investment aids to Czech Ostrava airport[2] and Marseille Provence airport[3] by Czech Republic and 
France respectively. Moreover, it approved the agreement between Aarhus airport and Ryanair[4] for discounts on 
airport charges and marketing incentives. The EU body also announced that the public intervention at Berlin 
Schönefeld Airport did not involve state aid[5].

 Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[1]) may be a solid choice for technical investors, as the firm saw some good news 
with its moving average crossover. RYAAY just saw its 50 Day Moving Average break out above its 200 Day Simple 
Moving Average, meaning that there could be some short-term bullishness for the stock.
 
 You could definitely argue that this has already started to take place, as shares of RYAAY have jumped by 11.9% 
in the trailing 4 weeks. If that wasn't enough, the company currently possesses a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), so it could 
have more room to run in the weeks ahead too.

KQ set to launch Sh3,000 fare carrier in April

 By: WANGUI MAINA
 Kenya Airways will launch its low-cost subsidiary JamboJet on April 1 with fares of less than Sh3,000 one-way in 
what is set to revolutionise air travel.
 The budget airline will initially launch on Kisumu, Eldoret and Mombasa routes from Nairobi before venturing to 
Bujumbura, Kigali, Juba, Goma, Mwanza, Zanzibar, Kilimanjaro and Addis Ababa in year's time.
 The Sh3,000 fare, which includes taxes, will help the national carrier lure travellers from road as well as ward off 
competition from budget operators such as Fly540.
 JamboJet flights will come with fewer comforts found on international airlines and passengers could be asked to 
pay for extras like food and baggage.
 'It's especially meant for people who do not fly often,' JamboJet CEO Willem Alexander Hondius told the Business 
Daily in an interview last week.
 'We would like to be a champion of the people by making it affordable for a big group of people to travel more. We 
think 30 to 40 per cent will be people who have not travelled before,' added Mr Hondius whom KQ tapped in 
September from KLM, which owns 26 per cent of the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed carrier.
 The Sh6,000 return ticket from Nairobi to Mombasa offered by JamboJet is 65 per cent lower compared to the 
Sh16,530 that its parent company, KQ, charges on the route.
 Rival Fly 540 charges Sh17,200 on the same route where fares on premium buses can go can go up to Sh4,000.
 Kenya Airways to launch low cost subsidiary in quarter one
 A growing middle class in Kenya and tourists have increased demand for air services as more and more people fly 
to holiday destinations at the Coast or to western in towns like Kisumu and Eldoret.
 JamboJet begins selling tickets on February 27.
 'Our aim is not to steal a lot of passengers from KQ, of course we will cannibalise, and we cannot avoid that. The 
aim of the game is to grow the pie and add new passengers on board and we are sure that it will work,' said Mr 
Hondius.
 The low JamboJet fares will cater for basics including a single hand luggage and random seat selection.
 Passengers will have to pay for refreshment on board and part with Sh500 to check in a suitcase and up to Sh860 
to get a preferred select a seat.
KQ set to launch Sh3,000 fare carrier in April
 Its leaner cost structure will see the budget airline go big on outsourcing as well lean on KQ for non-core functions 
like maintenance, ground handling, human resources and sales offices.
 JamboJet will directly employ 24 people with the rest of the 30 crew members being sourced from a third party and 
20 pilots hired through KQ. The national carrier will earn a fee from the subsidiary.
 'I pay them (KQ) for the services so I operate cheap. They are a supplier and we are the customers. And we keep 
the money within the group which is nice,' said Mr Hondius.
 'We have to keep the organisation as lean and mean as possible. I will not hire those cabin attendants myself; they 
are not on JamboJet pay roll. We hire them through a third party but fly with us. This will keep the cost down.'
 JamboJet will operate two Boeing B737s with a capacity of about 142 passengers in a single class, allowing the 
budget carrier to keep the cost per seat lower given KQ carries 116 passengers on the same plane, but on two 
classes.
 This business model will help KQ tap the rising passenger numbers within the region and match competition from 
budget operators, especially from European carriers eyeing Africa.
 Jambojet is looking to compete with Fastjet, which is modelled around Easyjet, the second largest low-cost carrier 
in the UK after Ryanair.
 Fastjet last year received approval to launch international flights to South Africa, Zambia and Rwanda from its hub 
in Tanzania and has ambitions for Kenya flights.
 The budget carrier is a U-turn for KQ, which merged its former low-priced unit Flamingo Airlines with its group 
operations in 2004.
 Kenya Airway's quest for a budget airline is part of a global trend where international carriers are forming 
subsidiaries to handle local routes.
 The national carrier hopes the budget arm will quicken the firm's recovery after it swung back to a Sh384 million 
profit in the six months to September compared to a loss of Sh4.78 billion the prior year.

Key highlights
In June 2013, the Ministry of Tourism launched the new edition of the Kounouz Biladi program to promote domestic 
tourism. Kounouz Biladi targets middle-class families who do not allocate budgets for trips. The ministry announced 
appealing prices and travel agencies provided attractive packages similar to those offered to international tourists 
during the 2012 edition of the program. The ministry also announced that Kounouz Biladi will be extended to other 
seasons to enable domestic tourists to benefit from discounts throughout the year.
In July 2013, the tourism board increased its focus on countries such as China, Russia, Eastern Europe, North 
America and the Middle East to promote Morocco as an attractive tourist destination. The Moroccan National 
Tourist Office has already set up offices in Beijing and launched a promotion plan aiming to attract Chinese tourists. 
The office has also requested airlines in both Morocco and China to fly direct flights between the two countries.
In June 2013, Royal Air Maroc announced that it will purchase 20 to 30 new aircraft by 2020, including five long-
haul aircraft. British Airways had increased the number of flights from seven to 10 between November 2012 to 
March 2013 between Marrakech and London. In April 2013, Ryanair has also renewed its long-term interest in the 
country by adding two bases in Marrakesh and Fez, increasing its Moroccan operations to 60 routes and eight 
airports, transporting 2.5 million passengers a year to the country.
Premium and high-end luxury hotel brands, such as Mandarin Oriental, Oberoi, The Address Hotels, Rocco Forte 
Collection and Kempinski, have started investing in new properties in the country; 54 hotel projects are planned with 
a total of 15,000 new guest rooms. Among these, 18 five-star hotels will be built in Marrakech. Kempinski is also 
planning two new properties in the country. The Royal Palace hotel, with 260 rooms, opened in Agadir in March 
2013, and in October 2013, the 270-room Al Houara hotel opened in Tanger.
The cost of renting a basic car with no restrictions on travel distance starts from MAD3,408.2 (US$395.0) per week 
or MAD491.8 (US$57.0) per day. This is very expensive for a North African country. Most car rental companies also 
demand a refundable cash deposit of MAD2,934.7 (US$340.0) or MAD4,875.0 (US$565.0) if not paid by a credit 
card. The best cities to hire cars in are Casablanca, Marrakesh and Tangier, where cars are available at 
competitive prices.
Moroccan travel agencies are capitalizing on domestic audiences through online advertising campaigns, and all 
travel packages booked through them are subject to a 15% discount. Domestic tourists can also access an 
interlocutor if they are dissatisfied with the travel agency's services.

Feb 14, 2014 (SBWire:http://www.sbwire.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 02/14/2014 -- Those searching for the Best Electronic Cigarette In 2014[2] can state 
that 2013 has been a milestone year in regards to electronic cigarette health risks. Many vapers see this as being 
one of the best years for the growth of the electric cigarette sales and growth as well as marking a decade in 
existence. One of the reasons is that whilst at best, smokeless cigarettes had been experiencing growth rates of 
averaging 100% year on year. Yet in 2013 this growth rate was continuously being reviewed upwards with 
estimates being between 240% to 300% for 2013 alone. Even in terms of regulation which has been linked mainly 
to electronic cigarette health issues there have been further good news for smokers.

What made 2013 such a special year in vaping was that it marked a decade with no reported deaths or casualties 
that van be linked to electric cigarettes. And this is something that the vapers are willing to put their faith in 
according to growing number of comments in e cigarette reviews.
Whilst the US is yet to release details about the proposed regulation of vapor cigarettes, the European Union made 
an important decision in late 2013. There had been many critics that had wanted for at best e cigarettes to be 
regulated in the same manner as tobacco products in fear of Alleged Electronic Cigarette Health Risks[4]. Yet due 
to public pressure from vapers and non-smokers the EU Parliament decided against making such a ruling for 
smokeless cigarettes. In general the ruling was that top electronic cigarette brands do not market their products to 
minors. Whilst the level of success of vaping cannot be quantified, there have been moves to allow the use of 
electric cigarettes in planes such as those in Ryanair. 
Know More About Electronic Cigarette Health Risks[5]
Many vapers believe that at best the electronic cigarette health risks that are in the media whilst being unfounded 
do deserve further scrutiny. But most importantly there have been signs that vaping be allowed to operate as it is, 
with the overlying demand that they not be marketed to minors.

 LA Broadcaster Apologizes To Samuel L. Jackson: Los Angeles entertainment reporter Sam Rubin has apologized 
to Samuel L. Jackson for confusing him with fellow actor Laurence Fishburne during a live TV interview. 
Unfortunately, while doing his apology, Rubin screwed up again and apologized to Danny Glover.
 Indian Man With Tail Worshiped as a Living God: A 35-year-old tea picker in India has had a tail since birth and 
some Hindus believe that the 14.5-inch tail growing out of his back is a sign that he's a living god - an incarnation of 
a monkey god know as Hanuman. One thing's for sure, when he gets older, he'll have a real 'tail' to tell.
http://www.johnnyrobish.com[1]
McGruff the Crime Dog Actor Sentenced on Drug and Weapons Charges: An actor who once travelled to schools 
playing 'McGruff the Crime Dog' has been sentenced to 16 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to multiple drug 
and weapons charges. Sounds like he was a very 'bad dog.' The presiding judge denied his lawyer's request that as 
punishment, he simply be spanked with a newspaper.
Terrorist Teacher Accidentally Blows Up Pupils: A group of Sunni militants were filming a propaganda video in a 
camp outside Baghdad when their instructor accidentally detonated a belt packed with explosives, killing 22 and 
injuring 15. So I assume that means that now, they're nothing but a splinter group.
Troubled Colorado CEO Commits Suicide With Nail Gun: The troubled CEO of American Title Services in Colorado, 
under investigation by state insurance regulators, was found dead in his home by a family member, the result of 
self-inflicted wounds from a nail gun. I'm not completely sure I want to live in a world where Home Depot needs to 
conduct background checks.
 Female Spiders Judge Mates by Their Gift-Wrapping: A new study has revealed that female spiders evaluate the 
physical condition and therefore the desirability of a male based upon his silk wrapping performance and how the 
gifts he brings to them look. All I can say is its a good thing human males aren't selected for their gift-wrapping 
abilities or the species would have died out ages ago.

Americans Like Smartphones More than Sex: A new Harris Poll found that more Americans say they can live 
without sex than without their smartphones. Which really is a testament as to how good phone sex has actually 
gotten over the last few years.
Airline to Offer Porn on Flights: Low-cost European airline Ryanair is reportedly planning to offer pornography as an 
in-flight entertainment option. Sounds like the seats aren't gonna be the only thing on that plane in the full, upright 
position.

 TripAdvisor Books Positive Earnings Results
 
 TripAdvisor Inc (TRIP[1]) announced earnings after the bell today, posting an EPS of $0.15, slightly beating the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.14, and Revenues of $212.7 million, surpassing the Zacks Revenue Estimate of 
$204.96 million. This is the fifth consecutive quarter with a positive earnings surprise by this company.
 
 Over the past few quarters TripAdvisor has been focusing on improving its mobile products, and has seen the 
fourth quarter web traffic increase 50% year over year. Moreover, the company just launched their new meta-
display platform; which allows customers to compare hotel pricing, and availability information from top advertisers 
on the TripAdvisors website itself. This new platform has allowed the company to increase their AD rates, which has 
helped the top line revenues grow 26% compared to Q4 2012.
 
 On the negative, there has been whispers regarding Google (GOOG[2]), and their potential of entering the Online 
Travel market. In a recent interview, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary touched on a 'new pricing system partnership' 
with Google. Currently, Google has both an airline search mechanism, and booking services in the USA, and the 
UK. Furthermore, the internet giant has also ran a hotel finder service since 2011. While the speculation is that 
Google will eventually enter into the market, they would have to compete with two of the biggest advertisers on 
Google, Priceline (PCLN[3]), and Expedia (EXPE[4]). Unfortunately, for TripAdvisor, they derive slightly less than 
one third of their business from Expedia. 
 
 In afterhours trading, TRIP has been fluctuating from an increase just over 2% to a half percent. We do note that 
on February 6th Expedia announced earnings, which saw TripAdvisor shares jump just over 9%. It appears, in 
afterhours trading, that TRIP's positive earning numbers were somewhat already priced into Expedia's strong 
earnings announcement. 
 
 Tomorrow Zacks will post a full earnings report on TripAdvisor Inc.

 Fast Market Research recommends "Travel and Tourism in Hungary to 2017" from Timetric, now available
Boston, MA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 02/12/2014 -- The Hungarian travel and tourism sector suffered due to the financial 
crisis which engulfed the country in 2009. Although the sector recovered in 2010-2011, the country entered another 
recessionary phase in 2012. However, the government and tourism promotion agencies have made continuous 
efforts to increase tourism activity.
Key Highlights
 - Hungaryaposs tourism sector is driven by international arrivals, with inbound tourism expenditure standing at 
HUF1.2 trillion (US$5.2 billion) in 2012, compared with HUF868.2 billion (US$3.9 billion) from domestic travel.
 - Health and wellness tourism holds an important place in the Hungarian tourism sector. Of the total international 
arrivals to Hungary in 2012, 13.2% visited for health reasons. According to the Tourism Ministry, six health resorts, 
Heviz, Hajduszoboszlo, Buk, Balatonfured, Zalakaros and Sarvar, were among the 10 leading tourism destinations 
in the country.
 - The number of domestic trips declined from 18.1 million in 2008 to 14.8 million in 2009, due to the financial crisis. 
Domestic tourist volumes rebounded in the following two years, reaching 15.6 million in 2011, but as the country 
slipped into recession again in 2012, the number of domestic trips declined to 14.4 million.
 - India has been recognized as a key emerging market by the Hungarian National Tourist Office (HNTO). A total of 
10,568 Indian tourists visited Hungary in 2012, totaling 28,714 guest nights in the same year. The aim is to increase 
this number by 15% over the next two to three years by promoting Hungaryaposs meetings, incentives, 
conferences and exhibitions (MICE), educational and leisure tourism offerings.
 - Timetric estimates growth in outbound tourist volume over the forecast period at a CAGR of 1.55%, with the total 
reaching 4.4 million in 2017, which is below the pre-crisis level of 5.1 million outbound trips in 2008. Outbound 
tourism expenditure is also expected to rise from HUF656.5 billion (US$2.9 billion) in 2012 to HUF736.2 billion 
(US$3.3 billion) in 2017, at a forecast-period CAGR of 2.32%. The expected improvement in economic conditions 
will strengthen consumer confidence and support greater expenditure on travel and holidays, which will support the 
growth of outbound travel.
"Travel and Tourism in Hungary to 2017" Is Now Available at Fast Market Research
 - Timetric expects growth in the capacity of the Hungarian airline industry over the forecast period, at a CAGR of 
2.37%. The highest growth of 6.2% will be recorded in 2013 as the number of seats increased with the launch of 
Solyom Airways and various new routes. LCCs will dominate the market as Wizz Air and Ryan Air have launched 
several new routes to capture the void in supply created by the failure of Malev.

 Recently published research from Timetric, "Travel and Tourism in Ireland to 2017", is now available at Fast Market 
Research
Boston, MA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 02/04/2014 -- Overall tourist volumes decreased in Ireland during the review period 
(2008-2012), due to the declining disposable income of consumers. Inbound tourist volumes expanded at a CAGR 
of 4.45% during the review period, and is expected to increase over the forecast period (2013-2017) at a CAGR of 
8.86%, supported by government initiatives to promote tourism across the European region.
Key Highlights
 - Real GDP is expected to grow by 0.4% in 2013 as fiscal adjustments, high unemployment and ongoing economic 
uncertainty weigh on domestic consumption. Exports growth will also remain poor due to low external demand. Real 
GDP, however, is likely to gain momentum and grow on an average by 2.3% between 2014 and 2017 aided by an 
expected improvement in exports coupled with a moderate recovery in private consumption from modest 
improvements in labor market conditions.
 - Irelandaposs economy failed to recover in 2012 recording a 5% decline in spending by domestic tourists as a 
result of decreased disposable incomes from the high rate of unemployment, increased charges and taxation, 
focusing on personal debt reduction and a poor labor market. With spending capabilities restricted, it is anticipated 
that Irish people will spend holidays at nearby destinations, cutting costs associated with air travel.
 - Failte is extensively promoting overseas to attract more tourists by organizing cultural events such as "the 
Gathering" and "Derry/Londonderry UK City of Culture". The Derry/Londonderry UK City of Culture provided a 
unique opportunity to showcase a diverse range of cultural programs and events, aiming at both cultural tourists 
and general visitors. The Gathering targeted the Irish diaspora in places like the UK, the US, Canada and Australia.
 - In July 2013, London and Dublin have planned to extend the Common Travel Area, which currently allowing 
unhampered travel for the citizens of both countries by creating a "mini-Schengen" area that enables tourists and 
business travelers from rapidly growing Asian economies, to undertake travels with the help of common visas 
between the two islands. The global tourism industry is expected to grow by 50% between 2013 and 2030, and half 
of the tourists will come from China.
 - In January 2013, Ryanair planned to launch operations in North Africa including Libya. These destinations would 
be served by 189-seat Boeing 737-800 aircraft with two new bases at Fez and Marrakech during 2013. Essaouira 
and Rabat were also newly announced airports that were launched at the end of March 2013. Canadian airline

 Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair has posted a quarterly loss as competition among European airlines has become 
fiercer. Management attributed the poor results to a sharp drop in fares meant to win over more passengers. On 
Monday, the Irish low-budget airline Ryanair reported that it had flown itself into a net loss in the third quarter of its 
financial year.
 The carrier announced that losses after taxation had amounted to 35.2 million euros ($47.5 million) in the three 
months to the end of December.
 According to Ryanair, this was the worst performance in a traditionally weak third quarter since 2008, with the 
latest results contrasting, though, with a net profit of 18.1 million euros in the same period a year earlier.
 Stable outlook
 "Our third-quarter loss of 35 million euros is in line with previous guidance and is entirely due to a 9 percent fall in 
average fares and weaker sterling," CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
 Discounted ticket prices had been introduced to boost passenger numbers, the chief executive added.
 Following earlier profit warnings, Ryanair stuck to its earnings forecast for the current year, announcing that it 
would remain unchanged at 500-520 million euros.

 Ryanair, the Irish low fares airline, today launched its Leeds Bradford summer 2014 schedule, with 23 low fare 
routes to European destinations, including a new route to Barcelona Girona.
 Leeds Bradford is the fastest growing top 20 airport in the UK. In 2013 3.3million passengers flew to over 70 
destinations with 11 major airlines, serving 24 countries worldwide. An £11 million terminal development was 
completed in 2012.
 Leeds Bradford International Airport serves Yorkshire, the largest county in England with a population of over 5 
million. The airport is located only 8 miles from Leeds the 3rd largest city in the UK.
 Changes to Ryanair and their PR have come in the wake of various scandals involving flamboyant chief 
executive Michael O'Learly last year, who now seems to be quietly stepping out of the limelight. 
 Ryanair has reported[1] a £29m loss for the last three months of 2013. It was the worst result for its historically 
weak accounting third quarter since 2008.
 That contrasted with a net profit of £15m in the same period a year earlier.
 Low fares, allocated seating and a second free a second free small carry-on bag, as well as easier website access, 
a 'My Ryanair' registration service, 24 hour grace periods, 'quiet flights' and reduced bag fees, are among the 
changes that Ryanair has made to revamp its image. 
 In Leeds, Ryanair's Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien said:'Ryanair is pleased to launch our Leeds Bradford 
summer schedule, with 23 routes, including 1 new summer route to Barcelona Girona, which is available to book on 
www.ryanair.com, ensuring Ryanair's Yorkshire customers can continue to enjoy Ryanair's lowest fares and 
industry leading customer service and punctuality from their local airport.'
 Tony Hallwood, Leeds Bradford Airport's aviation development marketing director, said: 'I am delighted to welcome 
David O'Brien to Leeds Bradford Airport to celebrate the launch of Ryanair's summer 2014 programme including the 
new route to Barcelona-Girona, a convenient gateway for Yorkshire holidaymakers flying to the Costa Brava region 
this summer.'

 Alarms are going off in assorted plunge protecting offices, now that the USDJPY has breached the 102.000 
'fundamental' support level, below which the Yen can comfortably soar to sub 100.000 in perfectly even 100 pip 
increments. 
The first trading day of February has brought another weaker session across Asia though some equity indices such 
as the KOSPI (-1.1%) are in catch-up mode given they were shut towards the back-end of last week. Over the 
weekend, the Chinese government published its latest official manufacturing PMI which showed a 0.5pt drop to 
50.5, a six-month low, and consistent with consensus estimates. DB's Jun Ma believes there was some element of 
seasonality affecting this month's result including the fact that Chinese New Year started at the end of January (vs 
February last year), anti-pollution measures in the lead up to CNY and efforts to control government consumption 
around the holiday period. The official service PMI was released overnight (53.4) which printed at the lowest level 
since at least 2011. The uninspiring Chinese data has not helped market sentiment this morning, with the Nikkei 
plunging -2% and ASX200 once again under pressure. SP500 futures have fluctuated around the unchanged line 
this morning although if support below the USDJPY fail solidly, then watch out below. Markets in Mainland China 
and Hong Kong remain closed for Lunar New Year.
 Aside from the ECB, which is meeting this week, other highlights in the week ahead include a big US data docket. 
Indeed the three most important data releases this week are today's January manufacturing ISM, Wednesday's 
ADP employment and of course, Friday's January non-farm payrolls. Also on Friday, the US treasury will once 
again officially hit its debt ceiling limit.
 Market Re-Cap
 European equities are treading water in negative territory amid cautious sentiment ahead of this week's plethora of 
key risk events. Consequently financials are seeing underperformance with health care stocks outperforming in a 
defensive move, which is acting as support for the SMI and FTSE 100. In stock specific news, Lloyd's shares are 
seen down 3% following their pre-market update which revealed the Co. sees GBP 1.8bln provision for PPI in Q4. 
Elsewhere, Ryanair are seen up over 5% after the Co. reiterated FY profit forecast of EUR 500-520mln and says 
pricing 'soft' but not declining.
Alarms Going Off As 102 Dollar-Yen Support Breached
 Following a host of impressive Eurozone Manufacturing PMI releases, EUR has trended higher, a move that has 
been exacerbated by the residual touted month-end related flows in EUR/GBP. GBP has seen weakness following 
this and a disappointing PMI Manufacturing release, a figure that is very much against the grain of recent UK data. 
Elsewhere, USTs and Bunds have recovered earlier losses and move back to unchanged, alongside the move 
lower in equities.

 Equities
 With participants looking ahead to key risk events this week in the form of ECB and BoE monetary policy decisions, 
as well as the monthly US jobs report, European stocks have trended lower. Consequently, financials have been 
put under pressure, whilst healthcare stocks have benefited from the defensive positioning by participants, which 
has provided the FTSE 100 and SMI with support. Lloyds shares have suffered this morning (-3%) as their pre-
market update has revealed the Co. sees GBP 1.8bln in provisions for PPI in Q4. Julius Baer shares are seen lower 
by over 5% following the Co.'s 2013 net profit CHF 480mln vs Exp. CHF 495mln. Ryanair are the sessions 
outperformer and seen seen up over 5% after the Co. reiterated FY profit forecast of EUR 500-520mln.
 FX
 EUR has been guided by an amalgamation of positive Eurozone PMI readings and residual touted month-end 
related flows in EUR/GBP. A move which has put downward pressure on GBP and later exacerbated by a 
disappointing PMI Manufacturing release from the UK. In Asia-Pacific trade, the Nikkei 225 closed 10% below its 
Dec. 30 high to enter a correction phase, alongside a less than impressive PMI release from China, which has 
consequently led USD/JPY lower. SNB's Danthine said the SNB would only consider scrapping the minimum 
exchange rate of 1.2000 in EUR/CHF if inflation were much higher and there was less upward pressure on the 
currency. (Blick)

 In conclusion, here is Jim Reid with the overnight and weekend recap:
 Right on my way back from three weeks away, the last couple spent travelling through Asia and Australia in 
seemingly non-stop meetings. I first travelled to Australia in 1998 when most of the tourists I saw were British, 
European or Americans. It's a measure of how the world has changed in such a relatively short space of time that in 
my down time exploring, most of the tourists were from Asia with many from China. I suppose this reflects the 
changing world order from the last time EM had a global crisis. So we think whatever happens in EM this year will 
have consequences for the global economy, global markets and global central banks. It'll be difficult to de-couple. 
Indeed, emerging markets are expected to account for 85% of all global GDP growth seen in 2013, up from an 
average of just 37% in the years leading up to the 1997-1998 emerging market crises according to IMF data.
 From all the stories that broke while I was away the most fascinating surely revolves around the Chinese Trust 
product that in the end wasn't allowed to be at the mercy of market forces. For me it's a microcosm of the fragility 
still present in global financial markets that a $9.0 trillion dollar economy - that will be the biggest in the world within 
the time frame of most of our careers - struggles to allow a $500 million investment product to default without there 
being market fears of it igniting panic in financial markets. This has now been a theme for the best part of 10-15 
years in global financial markets particularly in the developed world but more recently the EM world since the GFC. 
We've created a global debt monster that's now so big and so crucial to the workings of the financial system and 
economy that defaults have been increasingly minimised by uber aggressive policy responses. It's arguably too late 
to change course now without huge consequences. This cycle perhaps started with very easy policy after the 97/98 
EM crises thus kick starting the exponential rise in leverage across the globe. Since then we saw big corporates 
saved in the early 00s, financials towards the end of the decade and most recently Sovereigns bailed out. It's been 
Alarms Going Off As 102 Dollar-Yen Support Breached
many, many years since free markets decided the fate of debt markets and bail-outs have generally had to get 
bigger and bigger.
 This sounds negative but the reality is that for us it means that central banks have little option but to keep high 
levels of support for markets for as far as the eye can see and defaults will stay artificially low. As such we remain 
bullish for 2014. However it's largely because we think the authorities are trapped for now rather than because the 
global financial system is healing rapidly. So as well as EM being very important for 2014, we continue to think the 
Fed taper pace is also very important. If the US economy was the only one in the world then maybe they could 
slowly taper without major consequences. However the world is fixated with US monetary policy and huge flows 
have traded off the back of QE and ZIRP so it does matter. We have suspicions that the Fed may have to be 
appreciative of the global beast they've helped create as the year progresses. We stand by our call from the 2014 
Outlook (The Taper-Bubble Tightrope) that credit will end up having a good year but that H1 will be volatile but that 
H2 will be more positive as central bankers around the world look to be keeping their foot on the gas for longer.
 On this the ECB will be interesting this week in light of Friday's soft inflation print (0.7% year-on-year vs consensus 
of 0.9%), which returned headline inflation to the October 2013 lows. Core inflation was 0.8% year-on-year which 
was little changed on last month. DB's Wall and Moec think that last week's inflation data was a negative surprise 
for the ECB, making it highly likely that forward inflation projections will be revised down. Despite the better PMI, 
weaker than expected German inflation data in January, pressures in EM that could entail disinflationary forces for 
Europe and an ECB keen to be ahead of the curve on inflation all add to the justification for the ECB to ease the 
policy stance again in February (if not in February, certainly in March). Wall Moec expect the ECB to cut all policy 
rates by 5 or 10 basis points this week, implying a small negative deposit rate. The direct impact of a negative 
deposit rate may be less today than might have been the case 6 months ago when excess reserves were much 
higher. But there could be an important signal benefit from even a small negative deposit rate - either way a 
negative deposit rate would be another significant milestone in the theme of financial repression.
 The first trading day of February has brought another weaker session across Asia though some equity indices such 
as the KOSPI (-1.1%) are in catch-up mode given they were shut towards the back-end of last week. Over the 
weekend, the Chinese government published its latest official manufacturing PMI which showed a 0.5pt drop to 
50.5, a six-month low, and consistent with consensus estimates. DB's Jun Ma believes there was some element of 
seasonality affecting this month's result including the fact that Chinese New Year started at the end of January (vs 
February last year), anti-pollution measures in the lead up to CNY and efforts to control government consumption 
around the holiday period. The official service PMI was released overnight (53.4) which printed at the lowest level 
since at least 2011. The uninspiring Chinese data has not helped market sentiment this morning, with the Nikkei (-
1.6%) and ASX200 (-0.1%) once again under pressure. SP500 futures are slightly higher this morning (+0.15%) 
while 10yr USTs are unchanged near three month lows of 2.66%. Markets in Mainland China and Hong Kong 
remain closed for Lunar New Year.
 Aside from the ECB, the other highlights in the week ahead include a big US data docket. Indeed the three most 
important data releases this week are today's January manufacturing ISM, Wednesday's ADP employment and of 
course, Friday's January non-farm payrolls. DB is forecasting a +200k gain on both headline and private nonfarm 
payrolls. In addition, our economists expect the unemployment rate to fall two-tenths to 6.5% due to the expiration 
of extended unemployment benefits. Outside of the macro data, it's another big week for earnings with close to one-
fifth of SP500 constituents reporting. Janet Yellen will be officially sworn in as Fed chair today so we enter a new 
era. The US treasury officially hits its debt ceiling limit on Friday, but the treasury secretary will resort to 
extraordinary measures to push the funding deadline until sometime late in February while Congress debates when 
and how to increase the debt limit. The US Congressional Budget Office releases its annual economic outlook on 
Tuesday. In Europe all eyes will be on Thursday's ECB and BoE meetings. The service sector PMI readings will be 
published on Wednesday, German factory orders on Thursday and German and UK IP reports will be released on 
Friday. Australia's RBA meets on Tuesday. In EM, there will be some focus on the inflation readings from 
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. The fallout from Thailand's weekend elections should be clearer towards 
the latter part of this week. Now onto the review of January - a fascinating month.

unusual no-flap, high speed emergency approach to Chopin Airport in Warsaw (where it was diverted in order to 
exploit the longer runway).
 Flaps failures and consequent no-flap approaches result in high-speed landings due to the higher stall speeds.

ISTAT, 'decollano' i prezzi dei biglietti aerei, soprattutto low-cost
ISTAT, 'decollano' i prezzi dei biglietti aerei, soprattutto low-cost
International Business Times Italy

Jan 27, 2014 (International Business Times Italy:http://it.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Nonostante i venti di deflazione ci sono alcune voci nel paniere di beni monitorato dall'ISTAT che sembrano essere 
impazzite: una di queste è il prezzo dei biglietti aerei (specie low-cost), che secondo l'istituto di statistica nazionale 
sarebbe cresciuto dal lato passeggeri del 13,8 per cento nel 2013 su base annua. Si tratta di un rialzo poderoso, se 
si considera che la stessa voce era cresciuta appena del 4,2 per cento nel 2012.
 Per quanto possa essere controintuitivo a trainare il rialzi sono principalmente i prezzi dei biglietti aerei delle 
compagnie low-cost: i biglietti maggiormente interessati dai rincari sono quelli relativi a voli europei, sui quali le 
compagnie low-cost pesano per il 50 per cento circa. In questo segmento di mercato il rialzo è di ben il 22,3 per 
cento (era +2,5 per cento nel 2012), molto più in alto rispetto alla macro categoria delle tratte internazionali che 
registrano un +14,9 per cento, raffreddate dalle rotte intercontinentali che crescono di appena il 3,3 per cento.
 Verificando le serie mensili si scopre che il rialzo è stato più forte nella prima metà del 2013 per raggiungere il 
proprio picco nel corso dell'estate, cosa facilmente intuibile, poiché è la stagione delle vacanze. La spiegazione di 
questa fiammata non è da rinvenire in un aumento del prezzo del carburante, poiché benzina e diesel non hanno 
registrato alcunché di simile. Inoltre se il problema fosse al bocchettone della pompa di benzina l'intero settore dei 
trasporti ne avrebbe dovuto risentire: tuttavia la media del 2013 dell'intero settore si attesta ad appena +1,1 per 
cento.
 La spiegazione più plausibile sembra essere quella di una fiammata statistica: il confronto su base annua si 
riferisce ad un anno il 2012 in cui i prezzi sono rimasti relativamente compressi nonostante il carburante in 
quell'anno fosse meno economico. In altre parole le pressioni sui profitti registrate nel 2013 (si consideri che 
Ryanair nel primo trimestre del 2013 aveva visto crollare i profitti netti del 21%[1]) hanno impedito alle compagnie, 
specie quelle low-cost, di proseguire nel tentativo di continuare a raccogliere la domanda in un periodo di crisi 
economica tenendo i prezzi relativamente bassi.
ISTAT, "take off" the prices of airline tickets, especially low-cost
 Despite the winds of deflation, there are some items in the basket of goods that seem to be monitored by ISTAT 
crazy: one of these is the price of tickets (especially low-cost), which according to the national statistical institute 
would grow from the side passengers by 13.8 per cent in 2013 on an annual basis. It is a powerful upward, when 
you consider that the same voice had grown just 4.2 per cent in 2012. 
ISTAT, 'decollano' i prezzi dei biglietti aerei, soprattutto low-cost
 Although it may be counterintuitive to tow the increases are mainly the prices of airline tickets of low-cost tickets 
are the ones most affected by the price increases related to flights within Europe, on which the low-cost airlines 
account for about 50 per cent. In this segment of the market is rising by as much as 22.3 percent (it was 2.5 per 
cent in 2012), much higher than the macro category of international routes which recorded a 14.9 per cent, cooled 
from intercontinental routes, which grew by only 3.3 percent. 
 Checking monthly series it turns out that the increase was stronger in the first half of 2013 to reach its peak during 
the summer, which is easily understood, since it is the holiday season. The reason for this blaze is not to be found 
in an increase in the price of fuel as gasoline and diesel have not experienced anything like that. In addition, if the 
problem was the gasoline pump nozzle the entire transport sector would have had to suffer: but the whole sector 
average of 2013 stood at just 1.1 percent. 
 The most plausible explanation seems to be that of a blaze statistics: a comparison on an annual basis refers to 
the year 2012 in which prices have remained relatively compressed fuel in spite of that year was less economic. In 
other words, the pressure on profits recorded in 2013 (consider that Ryanair in the first quarter of 2013 had seen 
the collapse of the net profits of 21%[2] ) have prevented companies, especially those with low-cost, continuing in 
an effort to continue to raise the demand at a time of economic crisis by keeping prices relatively low.

Reasons to Buy
 Take strategic business decisions using historic and forecast market data related to the Hungarian travel and 
tourism sector.
 Understand the demand-side dynamics within the Hungarian travel and tourism sector, along with key market 
trends and growth opportunities.
Key Highlights
 Hungarys tourism sector is driven by international arrivals, with inbound tourism expenditure standing at HUF1.2 
trillion (US$5.2 billion) in 2012, compared with HUF868.2 billion (US$3.9 billion) from domestic travel.
 Health and wellness tourism holds an important place in the Hungarian tourism sector. Of the total international 
arrivals to Hungary in 2012, 13.2% visited for health reasons. According to the Tourism Ministry, six health resorts, 
Hvz, Hajdszoboszl, Bk, Balatonfred, Zalakaros and Srvr, were among the 10 leading tourism destinations in the 
country.
Travel and Tourism in Hungary to 2017
 The number of domestic trips declined from 18.1 million in 2008 to 14.8 million in 2009, due to the financial crisis. 
Domestic tourist volumes rebounded in the following two years, reaching 15.6 million in 2011, but as the country 
slipped into recession again in 2012, the number of domestic trips declined to 14.4 million.
 India has been recognized as a key emerging market by the Hungarian National Tourist Office (HNTO). A total of 
10,568 Indian tourists visited Hungary in 2012, totaling 28,714 guest nights in the same year. The aim is to increase 
this number by 15% over the next two to three years by promoting Hungarys meetings, incentives, conferences and 
exhibitions (MICE), educational and leisure tourism offerings.
 Timetric estimates growth in outbound tourist volume over the forecast period at a CAGR of 1.55%, with the total 
reaching 4.4 million in 2017, which is below the pre-crisis level of 5.1 million outbound trips in 2008. Outbound 
tourism expenditure is also expected to rise from HUF656.5 billion (US$2.9 billion) in 2012 to HUF736.2 billion 
(US$3.3 billion) in 2017, at a forecast-period CAGR of 2.32%. The expected improvement in economic conditions 
will strengthen consumer confidence and support greater expenditure on travel and holidays, which will support the 
growth of outbound travel.
 Timetric expects growth in the capacity of the Hungarian airline industry over the forecast period, at a CAGR of 
2.37%. The highest growth of 6.2% will be recorded in 2013 as the number of seats increased with the launch of 
Solyom Airways and various new routes. LCCs will dominate the market as Wizz Air and Ryan Air have launched 
several new routes to capture the void in supply created by the failure of Malv.
 Following a weak performance, the outlook for Hungarys hotel industry is positive. Over the forecast period, 
Timetric expects total hotel revenue to increase at a CAGR of 5.05% to reach HUF361.0 billion (US$1.6 billion) by 
2017. Growth will be supported by increase in the number of international arrivals and an increase in expenditure by 
Szp cardholders.
 Considering the expected growth in business travelers over the forecast period, Timetric expects the car rental 
market value in Hungary to increase slightly to reach HUF5.9 billion (US$26.2 million) by 2017. The average 
revenue per day is also expected to increase to HUF9,358.3 (US$41.6) in 2017, which is still below the pre-crisis 
level of HUF9,428.4 (US$54.8) recorded in 2008. Timetric expects that although on a growth track, the Hungarian 
car rental industry is rising at a slow pace and will not reach the pre-crisis level before 2015. The expansion of 
international brands into the Hungarian market will increase competition.
 Traditional travel agencies generated 77.6% of sales in 2012. However, travelers continued to swing from 
traditional channels of booking or planning, to online booking. The market value of online travel booking has 
steadily grown, with the online channels share of total market value increasing from 9.1% in 2008 to 22.4% in 2012.

 Did you see the Guardian 'In Flight' interactive map[1] showing all the flights worldwide that are in the air at the 
same time? I know others have posted about it, but it really is pretty amazing and worth spending some time on. 
Apart from the map, the site charts the history of commercial aviation and what we can look forward to in the 
future… A fucking nightmare. I don't fly much anymore and I still have a ton of miles for upgrades, even though they 
are getting harder and harder… But it is getting increasingly shitasmically worse. Next up… They'll have pay toilets 
and standing room only (Yeah, I know, Ryanair[2] would do that if they could.) Me, I'll stick with my 
favorite, Yorkshire Airlines[3] and Captain Boycott! 
Mmmm... That would be about 1968!

 Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA) have announced Ryanair are to introduce a new service to Girona Barcelona.
 The three times weekly service, serving the Costa Brava region in Spain, will commence on 1st April 2014.
 Flights are scheduled to depart from LBA on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and will operate throughout the 
summer season until the 25th October.
 The new route will provide a direct gateway to the popular coastal holiday resorts on the Costa Brava and enable 
independent travellers to gain easy access to the Languedoc-Roussillon region across the border in nearby France.
 Girona itself is a historic Catalan city whose picturesque old town whose colourful painted houses overlook the 
river Onyar. The historic city walls are also a popular sight for visitors whilst there are a number of food and cultural 
festivals over the summer period ideal for families.
For those who wish to visit the regional Catalan capital of Barcelona, the city is less than an hour journey away by 
car or train. For Yorkshire Rugby League supporters, the Ryanair route to Girona also provides an alternative flying 
option when playing Catalan Dragons in Perpignan.
The addition of Girona Barcelona will mean that Ryanair will serve a total 23 destinations from Leeds Bradford in 
summer 2014 flying to 7 countries connecting Yorkshire with Europe.
 Tony Hallwood, Leeds Bradford's aviation development and marketing director said: 'We welcome the introduction 
of Ryanair's 9th destination in Spain and expect that it will be a popular route for our Yorkshire holidaymakers. We 
also look forward to welcoming Spanish visitors to Leeds over the summer period, alongside visiting the nearby 
historic city of York.'
 Ryanair sales and marketing manager Maria Macken said: 'Ryanair is delighted to offer passengers in Yorkshire 
the chance to visit Girona in the North East of Catalonia this summer. With three weekly flights from Leeds Bradford 
it's the perfect destination for a short break or a longer stay.'

 The Little Italian Village That Could
 With the long winter lingering, my memories return to a quick jaunt from Spain to Italy last summer. Having visited 
Italy in the past, my favorite traveling companion and I decided this time to venture to Cinque Terre, which consists 
of five little picturesque villages on the northwestern part of Italy.
 We live in Spain, so after a two-hour Ryanair flight from Valencia to Pisa (about $80 roundtrip) we then took the 
train (TrenItalia) to the Italian Riviera. It cost a nominal fee of $13, and took only about an hour and a half. The train 
from Pisa goes through La Spezia Centrale, where we caught a local train to our destination; quickly jumping 
between villages is quite easy.
 In Cinque Terre, tourists usually spend a day hoping from one village to the next, but we wanted to feel what it 
would be like to live there. As each village has its own persona, we chose Vernazza because it has been reported 
by many, including Rick Steves, to be the loveliest of the villages with an ancient castle, pastel-colored cliff-hanging 
homes, an inner port and a small intimate seaside church.
 For centuries, the port of Vernazza had been a maritime base, fending off pirates from behind its high walls. In the 
1800s, a new train line connected it to the rest of Italy, and wine production escalated and the population increased. 
However, it faced many ups and downs, between pirate invasions and ill-used agriculture. Perhaps the town should 
be called The Little Italian Village That Could!
 In fact, it wasn't until a few days before we left that we learned Vernazza had been hit hard by massive flooding 
and mudslides on October 25, 2011. With over $135 Million in damages, the village was still recuperating two years 
later. Upon arriving, we saw a large poster that shares the story of the catastrophe with tourists. Seeing these 
powerful portraits of the locals recovering from the disaster helps to understand what they have been through.
 Our accommodations were in the opposite direction from the harbor in the upper part of Vernazza. We walked to 
the Little River that runs through the town. Now it was calm, moving as it always has, peacefully and quietly. One 
lingering sign of the massive damage the river had caused were the still unfinished walkways to pass over to the 
residences.
 According to Michèle Lilley, a native Californian who lives in Vernazza, the devastation was "A powerful force of 
nature that ripped out the guts of town, the insides of our lives and left them lying scattered in the street." Michèle 
Lilley, Ruth Manfredi and Michele Sherman founded Save Vernazza, which was a humble attempt to help Vernazza 
Memories of Vernazza
recover from this natural disaster. Two years later, they have over 2,000 supporters from all over the world helping 
to rebuild the town.
 We stayed at Camere Fontanavecchia di Annamaria Meregoni, which is a lovely little hotel. We were welcomed by 
Annamaria's mother who passed her time with friends outside on a bench or on her balcony overlooking the hotel. 
Our room was spacious, quaint and clean, and required no air conditioning, as a light breeze and ceiling fan kept us 
cool.
 Across the way is a delightful Sicilian cafe, Il Pirata delle 5-terre, where we had coffee and pastries along with free 
Internet each morning. The twin owners made our visit pleasant by chatting with us in English and making their 
home feel like our home. We met a lovely retired couple and photo enthusiasts from the U.S.A. who had been 
traveling for months and were at the end of their trip. They stayed longer than planned in Vernazza because they 
fell in love with the place.
 Later that morning, we hiked up the mountainside to get a view of the port below. Walking this steep slope in the 
scorching sun, we were happy to have finally made it to the top. This site is the centuries-old local cemetery, which 
enjoys one of the most spectacular vistas of the Ligurian Sea for all eternity.
 From there we also got a great view of the medieval castle, Castello Doria, and the tower, Torre Belforte, which 
protected the village from pirates for centuries. The castle was named after a prominent Genoese family who took 
part in forming the Republic of Genoa and helped finance many Spanish and Portuguese expeditions, including 
Christopher Columbus.
 We headed back to town, following the shops and galleries running along the main street Via Roma to the main 
square, Piazza Guglielmo Marconi. The shops all cater to tourists, selling gifts, clothing, art and specialty foods you 
can take home.
 For lunch, we took fresh panini sandwiches from The Lunch Box through a little passageway to a hidden beach on 
the other side of the cliffs. There were other families, both local and tourist, eating and playing in the Ligurian Sea.
 After a swim, we headed to the 14th Century Ligurian gothic style Church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochi, the 
anchor of the village. Inside, it is rather bare with only a few ornate elements. The emptiness reminded me a bit of 
the suffering this town has foregone.
 At night, we opted to go to Antica Osteria il Baretto, a restaurant recommended by a local. It doesn't have a 
spectacular view of the harbor like some of the other restaurants, but it was right in the center of the village, where 
we sat on the outside terrace. We were assured the food was delicious; we were not disappointed. I had a 
delectable mussel appetizer and penne bolognese along with some local wine; delicimo!.
 Afterwards, we were craving Italian gelato. There are three gelaterias in town, but we found Il Porticciolo as we 
walked along the harbor. Filled with children waiting for their scoops, we finally got our scoops of the creamy, 
scrumptious dark chocolate and strawberry fragola. We savored it while looking at the glimmering lights of the 
harbor.
 Following some lovely music, we found a little bar, The Blue Marlin, where a guest singer was entertaining. We sat 
down, met a couple from Australia and enjoyed the beauty of the woman's voice that had lured us through the 
village. People were laughing and applauding and we knew it was a special moment, a memory that would be 
engrained forever while battling long winters.
 Despite the reconstruction, the intimate and friendly Vernazza embraced us. The shop and restaurant owners 
welcomed us to enjoy as they do the many gems Vernazza has to offer.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] LESLEY KANE APPOINTED HEAD OF GROUPS CORPORATE 
TRAVEL 
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (15 Jan) launched a new Groups Corporate Travel service and 
announced it has appointed Lesley Kane (who moves from Head of Sales Marketing Europe) as its Head of Groups 
Corporate Travel, as it actively targets the group and business travel markets in 2014.
Customers can now access a 'Groups' section on the homepage of the new and improved Ryanair.com website, 
which will be followed by a new business product (to be unveiled in the coming weeks) with flexible tickets, reserved 
seating and fast-track through selected airports, as Ryanair opens over 20 new routes from Ireland, and over 150 
new routes from UK airports in 2014.
The launch of Ryanair 'Groups' will be of significant interest to all travelling groups including schools, sports clubs 
and all other large party organisers and with more than 1,600 daily flights, connecting 186 destinations across 30 
countries, both groups and business travellers will save time and money thanks to Ryanair's Groups Corporate 
Travel products.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 
'2014 is set to be a very exciting year for all groups and business passengers as Ryanair's entry into these markets 
will significantly lower their costs of travel. We're pleased to appoint Lesley Kane as Ryanair's Head of Groups 
Corporate Travel. Her extensive knowledge of sales and marketing, combined with her considerable experience 
from her time as Head of Ryanair Direct will ensure the successful implementation of Ryanair's new service 
improvements.'
Ryanair's Lesley Kane said:
 'I look forward to rolling out Ryanair's new groups and business product offering in early 2014. Ryanair is 
continually improving our customer service and has received numerous requests from group organisers and 
corporate businesses to develop and launch these new exciting products. From early 2014, groups and business 
customers will be able to enjoy the added benefits of our tailored products, which will support Ryanair's passenger

 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is working with Google on a new tool that'll streamline the way consumers 
search for and buy airline tickets.
 O'Leary told the Sunday Independent newspaper that he's "running out of road" when it comes to being the face of 
Ryanair, though his partnership with Google will revolutionise airline ticket buying.
 "There are some very exciting developments with Google, where we have been working with them on sharing the 
pricing," O'Leary said. "We'll be sharing the Ryanair pricing through all of the Google outlets, so when you go in, 
there'll be route selections, cheapest prices and so on."
 Google's price-comparison tool will allegedly present a swathe of available fares, without any bias, and then it'll 
allow whoever is conducting the search to just select their preference and click straight through to the airline.
 Google is developing the tool with Ryanair's help, though it appears Ryanair is only contributing data. The 
notoriously prudent airline has admitted it is not financing the project in anyway.
 "Because Google, being Google, want to show all of the prices from all of the airlines on display. They don't want to 
charge us, they make all of their money out of advertising," explained O'Leary.
 "They don't want to have a limited or biased search. They want to be able to say they've screened all of these 
airlines on all of the routes."

 The price-comparison tool is expected to launch toward the end of March. It'll "blow comparison sites like 
Skyscanner out of the water," according to O'Leary, who also predicted a technology shift for Ryanair and rivals 
as the emerging trend of mobile commerce becomes a mainstay in Europe.
"It's all going to move to digital and mobile," explained O'Leary. "In five years' time, everyone on Ryanair will be 
paying on their mobile. You'll pay for your drinks and snacks with your mobile. You'll upgrade to priority boarding on 
your mobile."

 In an interview[1] with the Irish Independent, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the popular Dublin, Ireland-based 
airline is working with Google to ‟blow [other airline ticket] comparison sites… out of the water.'
 "We'll be sharing the Ryanair pricing through all of the Google outlets, so when you go in, there'll be route 
selections, cheapest prices and so on. Google are developing a price-comparison thing themselves,' explained 
O'Leary. "Google will say, 'Here are the fares,' then you click straight through to Ryanair or someone else.
 O'Leary added that Google won't be charging the airlines to list their tickets. Instead, the company will monetize the 
service by displaying advertisements.
 As Venturebeat[2] notes, Google has has something that essentially matches this description, but it has largely 
flown under the radar. The company has operated Flight Search[3] in the U.S. since 2001, expanding to cover the 
European market last year, but the service hasn't gained much traction—capturing under two percent[4] of the total 
online market for airline ticket information. Flight Search, which the Silicon Valley giant acquired when it purchased 
ITA Software for $700 million that same year, has likely suffered from a lack of promotion leading to few people 
thinking of it as destination for travel information.
 In an email to the Daily Dot, a Google representative pushed back against any hype stemming from O'Leary's 
interview. 'We already have relationships with a number of airlines across the world but are always looking to 
improve the results by signing deals with more,' explained a company spokesperson, pointing to Flight Search. 'We 
have nothing new to announce at this stage.'
 The low-cost Ryanair has historically gone to great lengths to avoid having its flights listed on comparison sites, 
even going as far as filing a lawsuit[5] against one such site that attempted to do so. Judging from O'Leary's 
comments, it seems likely that Google aims have its system take in information from a significantly wider pool of 
carriers than its competitors.
Can Google become the Google of airfare search engines?
 However, a post by travel blog Skift[6] theorizes that Google avoided pushing Flight Search out of a desire to avoid 
alienating the online travel agencies that spend heavily on Google AdWords. 'I don't think Google wants to bite the 
hand that feeds it and antagonize any of its advertising clients,' travel industry expert Henry Harteveldt of Hudson 
Crossing told Skift.
 O'Leary said he expects Ryanair's partnership with Google to launch in March.

 More than two years after Google acquired ITA and added travel search[1] to its portfolio, the company is now 
actively working on an airfare search service, according to no-frills European airline Ryanair.
 Well, it has a very basic search engine called Flights[2] that operates somewhat like Kayak or Expedia or any of 
the other services out there but it now sounds like there is something more significant afoot.
 Speaking to the Irish newspaper the Independent[3], Rynaair CEO Michael O'Leary says that it is working with 
Google on a new price comparison search for airline flights that will 'blow everyone else out of the water,' and that 
the service is expected to launch in March. Ryanair is supplying its pricing information to Google to assist with the 
development of the service.
 It should be noted that O'Leary is a PR master, not above seeking publicity by circulating stories which are not, 
shall

say, 
necessarily 
firmly 
grounded 
in 
established 
facts

O'Leary has in the past suggested that Ryanair would put coin meters on toilet doors, requiring payment for use, 
and introduce 'standing room' on aircraft, allowing more passengers to be fitted in at lower cost. Each story allows 
him the opportunity to promote his mantra that Ryanair offers the cheapest flights on the market.
 All the same, the move would be a logical one for Google, so we suspect there is some truth to this one, which may 
be worrying for independent search services like Skyscanner[4] and Kayak[5].

 Google Flight Search may be revived and revitalised as the company is reportedly working with budget airline 
Ryanair to 'completely transform how consumers search for, select and buy airline tickets' according to the Irish 
Independent[1].
 Google Flight Search has been around since the company acquired ITA in 2011 and launched in Europe March 
2013. But with the service missing low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, EasyJet and FlyBe it has failed to make much 
progress.
 "There are some very exciting developments with Google, where we have been working with them on sharing the 
pricing,"said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. The service will 'blow comparison sites like Skyscanner out 
of the water" once the project goes live by the end of March, asserted O'Leary.
Competing with many of the organisations it serves, Google's new service may cause some consternation from 
sites that provide similar online travel and flight-comparisons - which rely on Google AdWords to drive traffic.
 "Because Google, being Google, want to show all of the prices from all of the airlines on display. They don't want to 
charge us, they make all of their money out of advertising," explained O'Leary. We can safely assume that Google 
will start to stake out partnerships with other major airline providers, ferries and rail services in Europe in further 
steps to create a truly successful all round transportation comparison service.
Back in November we reported Bing's integration with TripAdvisor[2], but Microsoft doesn't seem to have caused 
much of a ripple, it isn't experiencing its own 'TripAdvisor effect' as yet.

 Google is working on a major upgrade for its Flight Search service — in Europe at least — judging by a Sunday 
interview with Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary in the Irish Independent[1]. According to O'Leary, Google is 
developing a price-comparison service that will 'blow comparison sites like Skyscanner out of the water' when it 
goes live in late March. Google Flight Search has been around since the firm bought ITA[2] in 2011, but has failed 
to make much of a dent. It launched in Europe[3] last March, but with limited functionality and missing major low-
cost airlines such as Ryanair. Google said[4] a few months ago that it was content with the overall product, but 
maybe it's not — or maybe this is just catch-up time for Europe.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] THE CAA PUTS THE FOXES IN CHARGE OF THE CHICKEN 
COOP
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (10 Jan) criticised the UK CAA's false claim that Stansted airport does not 
have substantial market power, and the consequent deregulation of Stansted. Against evidence and its own earlier 
findings, the CAA now inexplicably claims that airlines are able to exert buyer power on Stansted in circumstances 
where Stansted was allowed by the CAA to double its charges in 2007, which caused a 5 year 27% traffic collapse 
at Stansted while Heathrow and Gatwick were growing. Even Easyjet moved flights to Southend to avoid Stansted's 
high charges.
Today's deregulation decision by the CAA will allow Stansted to increase charges in future and will result in yet 
more damage to UK consumers and competition. This decision confirms yet again that the CAA's regulatory regime 
is 'inadequate', as previously found by theCompetition Commission in its 2009 decision to break up the BAA airport 
monopoly.
Ryanair's Director of Legal Regulatory Affairs, Juliusz Komorek said:
'Ryanair regrets today's unsupported claim by the CAA that Stansted does not have substantial market power and 
the CAA's decision to deregulate Stansted. The CAA's failure to recognise that Stansted has profitably maintained 
its prices above the competitive level since 2007, despite a 27% fall in traffic, confirms the Competition 
Commission's finding that the CAA regulatory regime is 'inadequate'. 
Today's decision is an example of the CAA's regulatory failure which will again harm consumers as Stansted will be 
able to further increase airport charges whenever it wishes, without any reference to competitive price levels. 
Effective regulation with aggressive price caps is the only way to ensure that consumers are protected and that 
Stansted can grow its traffic on a sustained basis. Ryanair condemns the CAA's continuing failure to effectively 
regulate Stansted.'

 The Miracle on 34th Street turned out to be but a mirage on Wall Street. Macy's (NYSE:M[1]), riding a broker 
boost[2], surged some 7.64% to top the SP 500 Index (INDEXSP:.INX), yet most stocks still ended lower. This as 
investors sat on the sidelines awaiting this morning's awful employment report, with the Fed's freshly anointed cover 
girl[3] similarly content to mark Time. 
(Given that watchmaker Fossil Group (NASDAQ:FOSL[4]) was just cut, that may not be the smartest strategy.) The 
Dow (INDEXDJX:.DJI[5]) and SP 500 Index staggered to a split decision, this in a week when investors definitely 
weren't "minding their P's and Q's.". Please please me? With all due respect to those four lads from Liverpool, oh 
puleeze. No, thanks. J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP[6]) just tumbled 10% after announcing it was "pleased[7]" with 
holiday sales while providing no specifics. The Container Store (NYSE:TCS[8]) has endured a similar sell-off week 
despite equity analysts declaring themselves "pleased[9]" with its performance. And a shunned[10] Sprint 
(NYSE:S[11]) shed another 5.61% even as it claimed to be, well - you know[12]- with its NextRadio App. (Shia, you 
should be afraid[13]. Be very afraid, for that word is clearly the kiss of death.) Elsewhere, diamond retailer Zale 
Corporation (NYSE:ZLC[14]) endured a dog day in dropping[15] (so to speak) an NYSE-worst 14.29%.
In this morning's economic action, November wholesale inventories are expected to contract from the prior month's 
pace when they are announced at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. On the earnings front, Indian outsourcing and information 
technology outfit Infosys (NYSE:INFY[16]) beat Street estimates when it released its results earlier today.
Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA[17]): Shares get downgraded to Hold from Buy at Deutsche Bank.
Barracuda Networks (NYSE:CUDA[18]): Bank of America-Merrill Lynch lowers the tech name to Neutral from Buy.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK[19]): BlackRock stock is now Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs.
BP Plc (NYSE:BP[20]): BNP Paribas cuts the British petroleum firm to Neutral from Overweight, sending it lower in 
today's London trading.
Stock Downgrades: Polar Vortex? Las Vegas Sands Visited by the Curse of 'The Cooler'
Budget European Airlines: EasyJet (OTCMKTS:ESYJY[21]) and Ryanair (OTCMKTS:RYAAY[22]) are each lowered 
to Hold from Buy at Liberum.
Drug Stocks: Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY[23]) is now Underweight from Equal Weight at Barclays. Meanwhile Dow member 
Johnson Johnson (NYSE:JNJ[24]), upgraded only yesterday[25], gets taken to Equal Weight from Overweight.
Fossil Group (NASDAQ:FOSL): KeyBanc Capital moves the company to Underweight from Hold, saying that 
wearable technology trend could represent a competitive threat.
Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS[26]): In this, the week of a deep freeze that may cost the country five billion bucks, it 
looks like Las Vegas Sands stock has been struck by the curse of the "cooler." (Nothing to do with hepcats like 
Dean, Sammy, and Frank. In the casino world, "coolers" are people who inflict misfortune upon other players by 
their mere presence at the table, as depicted in a 2003 movie[27].) FBR Capital cuts the casino company to 
Perform from Outperform amid a less favorable risk:reward ratio. Its amended price objective is $85, up from $80.
Pacific Sunwear (NASDAQ:PSUN[28]): Shares are now Neutral from Buy at Janney.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE[29]): Cowen cuts stock in Pfizer, a key Dow component, to Market Perform from Outperform.
Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL[30]): RCL is reduced to Hold from Buy at DNB Markets.
Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK[31]): Barclays slashes Splunk stock to Equal Weight from Overweight.
Unisys (NYSE:UIS[32]): Shares are now Neutral from Positive at Susquehanna.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] SCHEME FULLY FUNDED TOP UP AGREED WITH TRUSTEES 
FOR ALL 121 MEMBERS
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (9 Jan) confirmed that its Irish Defined Benefit Pension Scheme ('DB 
Scheme') was wound up by agreement with the Trustees on 30th December 2013.
Following protracted negotiations with the Trustees, Ryanair agreed to fully fund a deficit of €9.7m and to pay an 
additional top up of €2.8m into the DB Scheme. The DB Scheme which has just 121 active members, currently 
covers less than 1.5% of Ryanair's over 9,000 strong team as it was closed to new members in January 2000, 14 
years ago. All 121 active members of the DB Scheme are now able to join the Ryanair Defined Contribution 
Scheme ('DC Scheme') with effect from January 2014. 
Ryanair's Deputy CEO CFO Howard Millar said:
'With only 121 active members and a deficit of just under €10m, the Board of Ryanair believes that it is the 
appropriate time to wind up the DB Scheme. By fully funding the deficit, and providing an additional top up of €2.8m 
to enhance transfer values, Ryanair has effectively eliminated pension liabilities from its balance sheet.
This is in marked contrast to many of our competitor airlines, whose pension schemes are running enormous 
deficits, in excess of hundreds of millions or billions. 
All active members of the Ryanair DB Scheme now have certainty that there is no deficit in the scheme as at 30th 
December 2013, and they will enjoy the benefits of the additional top up, which will enhance their transfer values. 
Going forward, all of these 121 individuals are free to join the Ryanair DC Scheme.'

 After the publication of the results and conclusions of the II Study about Satisfaction and Trends of airlines users by 
Travelgenio and Travel2be, the preferences of passengers are defined when choosing an airline
Madrid, Spain -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 01/09/2014 -- As it is shown in the II Study about Satisfaction and Trends of airlines 
users published by Travelgenio[2], the valoration of airlines is very possitive. About the 66,79% of passengers 
agree that if they talk about the last airline they used, the opinion is very possitive with high valorations[3].
The main reason for taking a flight is, firstly, leisure and tourism for the 46,27% of the asked passengers, while 
visiting friends and family represents only the 27,41%. Finally, the business trips is the third option for the 18,86%.
From the extracted data from that study, we can say that 37.41% of flights are to destinations in the EU compared 
to 21.54% which is decided by domestic destinations within Spain, followed, in third place by transoceanic journeys 
to the Americas, representing 19.57% (of which 6.15% are the United States), ending with 2.2% involving flights to 
eastern destinations such as Japan, China or Indonesia .
But, which are the most demanded airlines by Spanish passengers? Although the low cost fame, travellers[4] prefer 
these attending to prices. This explains why Ryanair is the most popular airline for the 13,38% of Spanish 
passengers.
We can find Iberia (13,16%) in the second place, followed by Vueling in the third with a 10,75% of users.
Out of the podium of the most frequent companies, Air Europa appears in fourth place with 7.2%.
Finally, and below the 6% of the purchased flight companies, we can find Lufthansa (5.92%), Air France (4.17%), 
Easyjet (3.95%), Argentinean Airlines and TAP Portugal (2 are located, 41%, respectively), KLM and Swiss 
accounting for 1.97%, 1.75% Alitalia, British Airways gets 1.54% notes and U.S. Airways and Air Berlin 1.10% 
respectively.
It is also significant that 27.41% of users airline donapost choose any of the 15 companies[5] with the highest 
turnover.
According to Travelgenio, Ryanair Is the Most Demanded Airline in Spain

 UNLESS something illegal was involved in the recent bidding for the Mactan-Cebu International Airport project, the 
Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) should no longer pussyfoot on this all-important public-
private partnership (PPP) project of what President Aquino has referred to as the 'last two minutes 'of his 
administration.
 The inclination of the DOTC to listen to the 'noises' being made about the supposed inefficiencies of the winning 
bidder is a step backward in the process. It does not give justice to the merit system that was incorporated into the 
holding of biddings. One may find it highly suspicious that questions are being raised on the capability of the 
Megawide-GMR Insfrastructure Ltd. consortium to undertake the project, as well as on why there was just one 
runway in the proposed airport, which should be dismissed, since many world-class airports have only one runway.
 It should be apparent to the DOTC that the Filinvest Development Corp.-CAI consortium lost big time in the bidding 
process. The earlier the government awards the PPP project—a cornerstone of P-Noy's all-encompassing vision to 
show to the world that the Philippines is back in business—to the winning bidder, the better. The proposed airport 
would show to the world the country's clarity of vision in wooing investors. Really, there is no better way to show 
this vision than an infrastructure project, such as the construction of an airport.
 The fact that Bangalore, India-based GMR has been favorably assessed by Airports Council International for its 
management of the South Asian country's Hyderabad airport is enough reason for the DOTC to move on from the 
bidding process. As the operator of the Hyderabad airport, GMR received a top ranking for its airport-services 
quality, or ASQ. Surely, GMR has enough credentials for the DOTC to award the project immediately.
 The P14.404 -billion offer of Megawide-GMR—which topped Filinvest-CAI's P13.999 billion—should now be 
considered as the winning bid, and the award signing should now be prepared. The noises the losing bidder made 
against the winning bidder should be seen for what it is: a move to win what it lost in a fair bidding process, a move 
that can be described as sourgraping.
 Filinvest's questions about the financial muscle of GMR and its termination of an airport contract with the Maldives 
have been satisfactorily addressed by the winning bidder. We understand that these facts were disclosed during the 
pre-bidding conference, and that this is the reason Megawide-GMR was allowed to bid for the second Cebu 
international airport. For all of Filinvest-CAI's posturing, the fact remains that it lost and this should be apparent to 
the Aquino administration.
 Cebu airport bidding should be awarded without delay
 Now, about the single-runway set-up in the second Cebu international airport, a Google search on single runways 
would show that the UK's Gatwick Airport is the busiest single-runway airport in the world and it processes about 15 
million passengers a year. For context, the total number of tourist arrivals in the country is less than 10 million. With 
that in mind, why need a second runway?
 Other notable airports that have only one runway are the US's San Diego International Airport and the UK's Luton 
International Airport. According to Wikipedia, the San Diego airport—also known as Lindbergh Field—is the busiest 
single-runway commercial airport in the world after Gatwick, with about 550 departures and arrivals carrying 50,000 
passengers each day. Meanwhile, Luton, the fifth-busiest airport in the UK, is home to EasyJet, Monarch, Thomson 
Airways and Ryanair.
 In basketball, the last two minutes of a game are deemed crucial, since it is in the final minutes that a team on the 
edge of defeat can have the chance to score a win. The Aquino administration is almost ready to finish its term, and 
is now in its last two minutes. With nary a PPP project that has taken off the ground, and with all the eyes of the 
world focused on the country, especially after Supertyphoon Yolanda caused so much destruction in the Visayas, 
the second Cebu international airport may provide the kind of 'perking up' the country needs at this time.
 Now, it is up to the DOTC to do its patriotic duty in this regard, and disregard the noises that a losing bidder is 
blaring in our ears that aim to distract the Aquino administration from energizing its team. The time is up for 
Filinvest-CAI's bid, and it is high time for the government to embrace the economic vitality that a new airport can 
show to foreign investors.

 Thai budget airline Nok Air is taking Ryanair's skimpy flight attendant calendar concept to the next level once 
again. 
 Instead of the airline's flight attendants gracing the pages of its 2014 calendars (à la Ryanair[1]), the "10 hottest 
bunnies" of Playboy Thailand[2] strike poses alongside Boeing 747s.
 The calendar isn't all that shocking -- last year Nok Air featured Maxim models[3] on the pages of their calendar, 
which made some controversial waves. 
 In March, Nok Air published a very specific advertisement[4] on Facebook seeking flight attendants for its fleet. 
Some of the specifications included being less than 25 years old, having proportional height and weight, and 
absolutely no braces. 
 Interested in the calendar? You can download a preview at Playboy Thailand's website[5] or check out photos via 
their Instagram[6] account. You'll probably have to fly on one of Nok Air's 747s to get a hard copy.

 Jan. 07--It's no secret that leg room on airplanes has become a commodity, just like meals, alcoholic drinks and 
luggage.
 The irony is that while the passengers are getting bigger (in all directions), the leg room is only getting smaller -- 
unless consumers are willing to pay up.
 If, like me, you've spent some eight hours straight crammed into an airline seat traveling over the holidays, you'd 
probably agree that it seems like leg room has shrunk.
 It has.
 But we're also getting bigger.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad347.pdf], the 
mean height of American men and women increased about an inch between the early 1960s and 2002. At the same 
time, the space between the seats has fallen about 10%, from 34 inches to between 30 and 32 inches, the New 
York Times reports [           http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/business/on-jammed-jets-sardines-turn-on-one-
another.html?_r=1]. Spirit Airlines goes as low as 28 inches of space.
 Over the same 40 years, American men and women also gained, on average, more than 24 pounds, according to 
the CDC. Meanwhile, the width of the coach seats remains the same, 17 to 18 inches.
 In other words, there's clearly a reason we're feeling cramped.
 Airlines are doing this for a couple of reasons: Consumers want cheaper prices and airlines want profits. 
Squeezing in even a few extra rows can make a difference of hundreds of millions on their bottom line.
 For instance, Southwest is installing "slim-line" seats with less cushion and thinner materials and reducing the 
maximum recline from 3 to 2 inches. That allows Southwest to add another row of six seats to every flight, which 
generates an extra $200 million per year in revenue.
 Other airlines, including European carriers Ryanair and EasyJet, are using stiff seats. Some, such as Air France, 
use nonreclining seats on its domestic flights, which take no more than an hour. The seats have no magazine 
pocket -- a way to create more leg room.
 A 
British 
company 
has 
designed 
a 
seat 
with 
adjustable 
width

http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/is-this-a-solution-to-uncomfortable-airplane-seating/?src=recg] as well 
BLOG: Public Investigator: Leg room on air planes shrinking, passengers growing
as the height and depth of the seat surface. This may help families traveling together, but it doesn't quite take care 
of the leg room issue for tall people.
 I wish I could tell you there's a silver lining here, but that probably won't be the case. So for now, consumers might 
as well be prepared: If you want more leg room, you will likely have to pay for it -- just like we do for all the other 
amenities that used to be free.

Jan 07, 2014 (The Huffington Post:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 New year, new vacation days. To Travelzoo Deal Experts, and millions of our subscribers, the change in the 
calendar means another opportunity to embark and expand our horizons. For travelers looking for a little inspiration, 
here's where our team of North American Deal Experts will be heading in 2014. 
 Safe travels!
 Natural wonders
• My 2014 bucket list trip is Peru[1]'s Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley. This ancient UNESCO World Heritage 
Site tucked away in the misty mountains of Peru will not be around forever, and each year restrictions on tourism 
get tighter. These ruins showcase the power and strength of humanity during the height of the Inca Empire. -- Mary 
Walker Baus, Los Angeles
• I plan on going to Iceland[2] this spring with a Travelzoo deal my friends and I bought. Visiting around the spring 
equinox is one of the best times to see the Northern Lights, plus this is a peak year in the lights' 11-year cycle. Even 
if we miss the lights, I'm looking forward to the spectacular scenery. --Kelsey Rexroat, New York City
• My 2014 wish list is to book a 5-star "The Bachelor"-esque type vacation to South Africa[3]. I tried to make it 
happen for my honeymoon in 2013, but it fell through ... I'm feeling like this is the year! Open-air accommodations 
look super romantic, helicopter rides are right out of an episode, and the game drives are perfect for an up-close 
and personal glimpse of the Big Five. -- Gia Anayas, Chicago
• Thailand[4] seems to have it all from enchanting temples to beachfront paradises. Over the past few years we've 
seen an increase in packages and hotel deals; because of that I've had a number of friends visit Thailand as one of 
their first experiences with Asia. It's easy to take an escorted package, but it also seems fairly simple to mix up the 
vacation by self-packaging and maybe even adding on Bali or the Maldives -- may as well while you're out there. -- 
Blaire Constantinou, Los Angeles
 Setting sail
• I expect a cruise to be such a very different way to experience Europe[5] during Christmas: beautiful vistas from 
cruising down either the Rhine or Danube and visiting world-famous Christmas markets. A river cruise is like a 
floating hotel through Europe at a relaxed pace. The itinerary usually includes many ports of call -- including 
smaller, hard-to-get-to villages -- and you only unpack once. Best of all, all meals, wine and guided tours are 
included in the cruise price. -- Debbie Kwok, Mountain View
• Cruising in Alaska[6]: I've always been a warm-weather gal, but for the past four years, I've wanted to sail on an 
Alaska cruise. Being able to spot glaciers and wildlife from the ship would be unlike any cruise experience I've ever 
Deal Experts' 2014 Travel Plans
had. Just based on pictures I've seen from Alaska itineraries, I'm looking forward to making Alaska part of my 
cruising repertoire in 2014. -- Jessica Tilley, Las Vegas
 Big city stays
• St. Petersburg, Russia[7], is on my list this summer. I've heard great things about their white nights, and it's 
unchartered territory for me. I'm looking forward to experiencing the culture, arts and history as well. -- Rifi Sachdev, 
Los Angeles
• New Orleans[8]: beignets, gumbo and po' boys. -- Annie England, New York City
• I've spent years reading about the beautiful street art and the stunning architecture of Lisbon: I'm hoping 2014 is 
the year I see Portugal[9] firsthand. -- Hilary Solan, Chicago
• Riga, Latvia[10], was named the 2014 European Capital of Culture, and there's cheap air access: Ryanair and 
Wizz Air have been operating low-cost flights for some time now. -- Hafeez Jessa, Vancouver
 Family-friendly fun
• I'm going to Disney World! I've always wanted to say that - we're taking our toddler to meet Mickey and counting 
down the days! Then once we get to Orlando[11], we'll be counting the minutes in line ... -- Josh Gershenson, 
Chicago
• Niagara Falls[12], a classic vacation destination. It's time I see what all the fuss is about for myself. -- Lydia Smith, 
New York 
 Postcard-worthy landscapes 
• In 2014 I'm hoping to head to the Amalfi Coast in Italy[13]. I've never been to Italy, and the wine, food, culture and 
picturesque coastline seem truly unique -- and romantic. -- Jessica DeBolt, Los Angeles
• Cambodia. I haven't made it to Asia yet, and I'd love to make Cambodia my introduction to the continent. Friends 
who have gone have told me that the gorgeous scenery, rock-bottom prices and friendly locals make it worth the 
trip. -- Ashley Hamilton, Chicago
• Napa Sonoma[14] -- I wish it was a more exotic bucket list, but with young kids, the ultimate dream of a South 
Africa safari, an Emerald Isle experience or a New Zealand quest is still a few years off. -- Andrew Young, New 
York City
• St. Johns, Newfoundland, not to be confused with Saint John, New Brunswick. It is the oldest and most easterly 
city in North America. There is a ton of Maritime history and unique shops and restaurants along with landscapes 
that are hard to come by elsewhere. -- William Brown, Chicago
• I would like to go to Australia[15] and New Zealand[16]. I've always wanted to go and now have more of a reason 
because I made some friends from there during my 2013 Travelzoo Experience to Thailand! -- Sarah Firoozi, Austin
 Sun-soaked stays
• For me, it's Belize[17]! Why: It's exotic while still accessible. I am an avid sailor, and they have some great 
conditions plus there's a nice combination of beaches as well as hills and mountains with a bit of a tropical touch. -- 
Saskia Jacques, Toronto
• Booked: Bora Bora and Moorea[18] honeymoon plus Cancun[19] bachelorette party. -- Meghan Turner, Los 
Angeles
• Within the U.S., I'd like to spend a long weekend with a good book and my feet in the sands of Puerto Rico[20]. 
With no passport required, and U.S. currency accepted, it's the closest and most convenient way to escape the 
Midwest and take in island life. -- Antoinette Fadera, Chicago
• Cartagena[21]: I've heard it has a rich cultural history along with a great beach. It's a pretty inexpensive trip, and 
JetBlue flies direct from JFK! -- Sean Cahill, New York City
• A girl has to dream big, so my list wouldn't be complete without a trip to the land of opulence -- Dubai[22]. -- Heidi 
Stallings, Chicago

 Lindsay Wilson of Shrink That Footprint just published a pretty awesome little infographic[1] on some interest 
transportation statistics. Needless to say, the US compares rather depressingly to other countries in this arena. I 
keep up on this stuff pretty obsessively, but I have to say that I was quite surprised by some of the stats. Comments 
on those below the infographic.
Flying — Man, the Irish are going crazy! As Lindsay notes, that has got to be at least partially (if not largely) due to 
Ryanair[2].
 Rail — Wow, I knew the Japanese were on top, but they're way on top. Even more surprising, had no idea the 
Swiss rode the rails so much more than everyone but the Japanese. Oy, US…
 Driving — Man, we drive that much more than Canadians and Australians! Wow. The scariest thing there, though, 
is how tiny China's bar is on that one, and how much bigger the country wants it to become.
 Biking — I'm with with Lindsay on that one: 'Personally I prefer the Dutch option, as I wrote in my ode to 
Amsterdam[3].' For my perspective, I'll throw in: 15 Things I Loved about Living Bicycling in Groningen (the 
Netherlands) +25 Pictures[4].
 But biking is great beyond the Netherlands. Also see:

 Any other big thoughts?

Jan 02, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 With a resurgent consumer and flat oil prices, it has been a pretty good time to be in the airline industry. Stock 
prices in this segment of the transport space have soared, and many appear well-positioned for 2014 gains as well. 
However, while many airlines have seen strength, a few have fallen by the wayside and could see their stocks 
grounded this year. In particular, Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[1]) may be in trouble and could be a name to avoid in 
this otherwise hot space.
While Ryanair was still up significantly for 2013, but its performance in the second half of the year has been terrible. 
The stock has tumbled by over 12%, while many of its U.S. counterparts saw some of their best gains in the past 
six month time frame.
The reason for this slump in the tail end of the year was largely due to slashed expectations[2] for its full year profit. 
Now, the company expects between EUR500 million and EUR520 million for the year, down from its previous 
outlook of between EUR570 million- EUR600 million, as well as last year's EUR 569.3 million.
Thanks to this reduced guidance, shares of RYAAY plummeted followed the release, while analysts have also 
reduced their expectations for the company's earnings as well. Add in worries over price competition and concerns 
regarding the euro/pound exchange rate, and Ryanair's outlook appears to be pretty bleak.
Ryanair Earnings Estimates in focus
Earnings estimates have fallen like a stone after the company's bearish outlook, with the current quarter falling from 
11 cents a share 60 days ago to just two cents a share today. Meanwhile, the full year estimate has dropped from 
$2.68/share 60 days ago to $2.49/share today.
With this drop, RYAAY looks to have an earnings contraction of roughly 7.7% for the current year, though if 
estimates had remained flat over the past two months, the earnings decrease would have been less than 1% year-
over-year.
Bear of the Day: Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) - Bear of the Day
And though the company is expected to rebound in the next year period, competitive pressures are definitely 
building in the European market, and if the euro continues to strengthen against the pound it could hurt Ryanair's 
key British travel market.
With these factors in mind, it is pretty easy to see why Ryanair has fallen to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). And with 
this rating, we are definitely looking for more underperformance from this company—especially when compared to 
its high-flying peers—as we fly further into 2014.
Other Picks and Bottom Line
Thanks to the strong consumer market and sluggish oil prices, many other airlines have prospered in this 
environment and are still well-positioned as top picks going forward. In fact, the airline industry currently is in the top 
11% for all industries, so there are plenty of solid stocks for investors seeking an airline pick right now.
While smaller airlines such as Hawaiian Holdings (HA[3]), JetBlue Airways (JBLU[4]), and Alaska Air Group 
(ALK[5]) all receive #2 ranks —both have also surged to #2s from #3s last week—and are interesting selections, a 
trio of Chinese airlines might actually be the way to go in this market.
That is because Air China (AIRYY[6]), China Eastern (CEA[7]), and China Southern Airlines (ZNH[8]), all receive a 
top Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), and were 'Holds' just one week ago. Given this surge in their Zacks Rank to the 
top echelon, any of these could be better selections than Ryanair which could be headed for more turbulence this 
year, especially compared to its top ranked counterparts in the space.

 Simple message here - all the very best for 2014. Biog challenges ahead but let's double-up on our efforts to meet 
them all and move onwards and upwards! 
 First blog in 2014 and before saying anything else I'd like to extend my heartiest best wishes to you all for a bright, 
prosperous and healthy New Year! It will certainly be a busy one for all of us hear at MRN and we hope you'll be 
ready to join in at least some of the campaigning activity we are planning.
 What also needs to be done on this first day of 2014 is to raise a glass of sparkling water to celebrate the lifting of 
the transitional controls on our fellow Bulgarian and Romanian citizens of the EU which have prevented them from 
taking employment in the mainstream jobs market. Anyone with any real contact with these two communities knows 
that the effect of these measures has been to bottle up a lot of talented, ambitious young people into marginal areas 
of the economy, eking out poor existences on the books of agencies selling them on as 'self-employed'. It is good 
that this charade is coming to an end for this group at least, though we shouldn't forget our fellow EU Croatian 
citizens, who have just started the long haul under the stressful limitations of transitional controls.
 The red-top tabloids are spending today at the charter flight airports and the Channel crossings carrying the 
coaches that will be en route to destinations across the UK. The advance signs - empty seats being reported by 
Ryanair and the other carriers - suggests they will find the evidence of 'invasion' hard to come by, though no doubt 
they will try to make the most of what they have anyway.
 For our part our plans for 2014 are to continue to build a network of supporting organisations and individuals which 
will be working to support migrants wherever they are from, helping them to build bridges with the settled 
communities and ensuring that they are in a position to claim all the rights they will need to ensure that their 
migration meets the goals they are aiming for.
 The big dates for your diary in the first half of the New Year ought to be 22 March,[1] when anti-racist and migrant 
support groups will celebrating UN Anti-Racism with a national march in London. It will also be the occasion to kick 
New Year Greetings to All, and a hearty welcome to our A2 friends and their new rights to employment!
off the work we expect to be doing over the following weeks as the European Parliament and local government 
election campaign gets underway - voting probably (they haven't officially fixed the day yet) on 22 May.
 MRN is also going to be involved in the Open Generation event, taking place in April, which will be providing a 
platform for young people to speak our on their experiences on migration and the free movement of people. Keep a 
watch on MRN blogs for that.
 But even before that you will want to know about this years TEDxEastLondon[2] event, taking place on 18th 
January in Bethnal Green. This will be the third year that folk have gathered to discuss the theme of 'Society 
Beyond Borders' using TEDx's unique style of conference format. This will be a place where the very biggest of 
ideas and visions are set out and discussed in a way that guarantees stimulation and discussion. Do join our 
colleagues supporting this event on what will be a truly exciting day!
 And again, all the best for 2014 to everyone interested in the work MRN is doing. We hope to meet and hear from 
you very soon in the New Year.

Jan 01, 2014 (SBWire:http://www.sbwire.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Recently published research from Business Monitor International, "Morocco Tourism Report 2014", is now 
available at Fast Market Research
Boston, MA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 01/01/2014 -- Morocco is investing heavily in the run up to its hosting of the Club 
World Cup championship, to be held in the cities of Marrakesh and Agadir in December 2013. The investment in 
transport and accommodation infrastructure will make the country far more competitive as a tourism destination and 
raise its international profile.
Sign of the downturn in tourist arrivals suffered by Morocco during 2012 was the October 2012 cancellation of all 
flights to Morocco by Ryanair. However, the fact that these have since been reinstated is proof of the marked 
improvement in European tourist arrivals. The company now has flights to 6 Moroccan airports. To recover from its 
declining arrivals, the country will invest about EUR15bn in tourism between 2012 and 2020, Haddad told Le 
Figaro, with the majority of this funding to come from private investors. The government will reportedly back up the 
private investment with extra spending on beach resorts and cultural heritage sites
Beyond 2013, BMI believes that the ongoing recovery in economic stability across Europe will lead to a recovery in 
tourist arrival growth rates to Morocco, with the country forecast to receive 11.8mn visitors by the end of our 
forecast period in 2017. However we believe that the government target of 11.5mn tourists in 2014 is unrealistic and 
we believe arrivals will remain under the 10mn barrier until 2015. Much of the investment going into attracting 
tourists is focused on the accommodation sector with a large number of new high and low end hotels under 
development or n the project pipeline. Around 40 new hotels are expected to be constructed by 2016.

However a great deal is also being focused on other aspects of the countyaposs physical infrastructure in order to 
cater to the influx of tourists expected in December 2013 for the Club World Cup event, which is taking place in 
Africa for the first time.
Recent developments include:
Just Released: " Morocco Tourism Report 2014"
 - Two new Hilton hotels are under construction in Tangier and due to open by the end of 2014. These are the 323-
room Hilton Garden Inn Tanger and the 182-room Hilton Tanger City Centre Hotel Residences.
 - In October 2013, the tourism minister Lahcen Haddad emphasised the importance of German and British tourists 
and announced that the ministry is aiming to bring more than 1mn British tourists every year to the country by the 
end of 2014.
 - Qatari QPM has signed an agreement to help the Moroccan tourism sector develop new projects and attract 
investors.
 - The expansion of the Port of Tangier will provide facilities for the worldaposs largest cruise ships and the country 
expects an additional 300,000 tourists in 2016 and 750,000 tourists by 2020.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (31 Dec) 
confirmed that all 10,000 copies of its 2014 Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar have sold out, raising €100,000 
for its charity partner, Teenage Cancer Trust, the only UK charity dedicated to improving the quality of life and 
survival chances for young people aged between 13 to 24 who are battling cancer.
The €100,000 proceeds from the Ryanair 2014 Cabin Crew Charity Calendar bring to €700,000 the total raised by 
Ryanair's brilliant cabin crew for charity since the first calendar was published in 2008 and Ryanair will present the 
proceeds to Teenage Cancer Trust in the New Year.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Once again, support for Ryanair's Cabin Crew Charity Calendar has been a huge hit with all calendars selling out in 
record time - as well as almost 750,000 video views on YouTube - which you can watch here[2]. Sincere thanks to 
all those who bought the calendar.
We are delighted that through the voluntary efforts of our fabulous cabin crew, Teenage Cancer Trust will benefit 
from the €100,000 raised this year, which will help support their 27 specialist cancer units for young people across 
the UK, and brings the total raised by Ryanair's cabin crew to €700,000 over the last 7 years.'

 Air travel is always kind of ridiculous. But this year, there were some completely crazy things that happened in the 
world of airlines, airplanes and airports. 
 These were the moment this year that had us shaking our heads -- the WTF moments, if you will. 
 That time when...
 U.S. Airways flight attendant kicked a blind man off a plane[1]. Jetstar employees defaced luggage[2] with stickers. 
British Airways refused to fly[3] an obese man home -- after they had already flown him in the opposite direction. A 
massive plane landed[4] at the wrong airport. Part of a plane wing burst open[5]... mid flight! Delta canceled a 
passenger flight[6] so the University of Florida men's basketball team could get to its game on time. A naked 
passenger[7] challenged an airplane captain to a fight and got tasered. Qatar Airlines required female employees to 
ask permission[8] to get married and have babies. A study revealed airlines have made $27.1 billion[9] off additional 
fees. Ryanair charged a man[10] to change his flight after his family died in a fire. They gave him a partial refund in 
the end. Really? A teenager decided to wander around an airport and impersonate a flight attendant[11] for several 
days. Flybe organized an entire flight of redheads[12]. A computer outage[13] caused major flight delays worldwide. 
A U.S. Airways flight[14] was delayed because of a swarm of bees. Spirit Airlines[15] turned Anthony Weiner's 
comeback campaign and accompanying scandal(s) into a crude advertisement. Indian airline GoAir[16] decided to 
hire only lightweight, female flight attendants... It was reported that one in four[17] flights is late. Shocking? No. 
Annoying? Yes. United Airlines announced[18] baggage fees will be "free" -- but only if you have a "checked 
baggage subscription." That subscription will cost you $349. So it's not really free. Good try, United. Richard 
Branson dressed up like a flight attendant[19] and it was hilarious. 
 And, of course, more airline fees were added. Check those out in the slideshow below.

Airlines We Lost in 2013
Airlines We Lost in 2013

Dec 30, 2013 (The Cranky Flier:http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Another year has come to a close, and with it, so have the lives of several airlines. There weren't any spectacular 
shutdowns as we've seen in previous years[1], but that doesn't mean there weren't a handful of interesting stories 
to pop up. I'm sure I missed some obscure airlines out there, so feel free to add your own in the comments.
 Kingfisher - January 1, 2013[2]
Admittedly, this one was a little late. Kingfisher really shut down in 2012 but there were so many promises that it 
would come back, I wasn't convinced it was truly dead. I was wrong. Founded by the Richard Branson of India, 
Vijay Mallya, Kingfisher had a meteoric rise when India deregulated air travel. It grew fast, bought Air Deccan, 
announced plans to join oneworld, and ordered a ton of airplanes. It created amazing service levels and won plenty 
of awards, but it was horribly unprofitable. Management continued to lie about how things would all work out. In the 
end, a lot of workers were stiffed and the airline fell apart.
Ryan International - January 11, 2013[3]
No, no, this isn't Ryanair. That airline continues to make silly money flying around Europe. Ryan International was a 
US-based airline that you probably never knew. Why? Because Ryan flew airplanes mostly under the names of 
other companies. It was an airline for hire, basically. It did a lot of military work as well, but it lost those contracts 
over time. Ryan also leased out airplanes to whomever needed them. I guess nobody needed their small fleet 
anymore, because they disappeared without making any real noise.
OLT Express Germany - January 28, 2013[4]
For years, OLT was a small regional airline in Germany, but things went downhill and eventually it was purchased 
by a Polish company. That's when things got interesting. The Polish company also purchased two Polish airlines 
and merged them into OLT Express in Poland. The German airline became OLT Express Germany and they were 
going to take over Europe with their awesomeness… or not. The parent company's fortunes (or lack thereof) 
crumbled and OLT Express in Poland failed last year. OLT Express Germany hung on until this year. Under new 
ownership it merged with Contact Air, but it wasn't enough. The airline was struggling and it was eventually put out 
of its misery.
Airlines We Lost in 2013
Bahrain Air - February 13, 2013[5]
Bahrain Air was a confused little airline from the beginning. When it launched in 2008, it was supposed to be a low 
cost carrier. That lasted for a couple of years until the airline made an about-face and decided to become full 
service. That didn't work, and the airline bled to death. Apparently, it didn't want to go down without a fight, so it 
hoisted the blame on to the government. Bahrain Air said the unstable political situation led to the failure of the 
airline. I guess there's only room for one poorly-run airline in Bahrain, and that's Gulf Air.
Chathams Pacific - March 3, 2013[6]
If you want to hear a tale of crazy government policy, look no further than Tonga. Air Chathams is based in New 
Zealand specializing in flights to the distant Chatham Islands. But back in 2007, it stepped into the domestic Tongan 
market, one that has seen failed airline after failed airline. Things were going ok but the government decided it 
wanted competition. So it took an MA-60 airplane that was gifted to it by China (who knows why) and offered it on 
lease to a local mechanic to start his own airline. Air Chathams, realizing this was an impossible competitive 
situation, decided to walk away and shut down Chathams Pacific. I can't say I blame them.
Armavia - April 1, 2013[7]
Armavia really was the closest thing Armenia had to a national airline for the last few years. Unfortunately for the 
company, that standing didn't prevent the airline from going down the tubes. The owner simply was never able to 
get the airline on strong financial footing and racked up debt like crazy. The state has apparently agreed to repay 
the debt, but the airline isn't coming back. Armenia is now primarily reliant upon foreign airlines with a few flights by 
Air Armenia thrown in for good measure. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before someone else tries to start an 
airline there.
Saha Airlines - April 9, 2013[8]
I wasn't quite sure whether to include Saha since it has shut down previously and come back from the dead. But 
this time, I fear it might be done for. And why do I care? Saha, based in Iran, was the last commercial operator of 
the 707. Yes, the 707, an airplane that makes Delta's DC-9s look young. Saha clearly was only flying the airplanes 
because it couldn't get any other airplanes thanks to the embargo against Iran. But enthusiasts loved it and flocked 
to the chance to fly the 707. For now, it appears those flights have ended. Maybe they will come back, but I'd be 
surprised. So long, 707.
Dutch Antilles Express - August 26, 2013[9]
The Netherlands Antilles no longer exists, and now neither does its short-lived carrier Dutch Antilles Express (DAE). 
DAE was based in Curacao and bounced around the Caribbean, even reaching into the US. It did so while losing a 
bunch of money and relied on bailouts from the Curacao government to keep flying. Its last attempt at a loan was 
turned down by Curacao and that was the end of the line for the airline. It's not uncommon to see Caribbean airlines 
disappear, so this one will probably be forgotten quickly.
Augsburg Airways - October 26, 2013[10]
Augsburg Airways began life as a domestic airline within Germany. That lasted a couple decades, but by the turn of 
the century, change was in the air. In 2000, Augsburg became a regional affiliate of Lufthansa's. The partnership 
grew and Augsburg decided to pass over more of its core functions to Lufthansa. But in 2012, Lufthansa decided to 
restructure its regional operation. As part of that, Augsburg found itself out in the cold with no flying left to do on 
Lufthansa's behalf. The writing was on the wall, so, like Cirrus last year, Augsburg decided to just shut down. Its last 
flight was on behalf of Lufthansa on October 26.
Flynonstop - October 29, 2013[11]
These guys had a great plan. They were going to fly nonstop. But that's kind of where the plan stopped. Six months 
after launch, they were out of money. Really they just wanted some more international flights from their base in 
Kristiansand, Norway (home of fewer than 100,000 people). So they leased an airplane and flew throughout 
Europe. Turns out the reason nobody flew internationally beyond Scandinavia was because there wasn't enough 
demand. Unfortunately for their pocketbooks, it took them 6 months after launch to realize that fact.
Airlines We Lost in 2013
Belle Air - November 25, 2013[12]
Little Belle Air started up as the first low cost carrier in Albania and when it shut down, it left… no carriers at all 
based in Albania as far as I can tell. What caused this airline to fail? How about the 'general economic situation, the 
decline of the purchasing power, recession in the markets it operates as well as from the freezing for over 18 days 
of its bank accounts.' I'm gonna say that the last point might be the most salient. When Belle Air failed, its 
subsidiary Belle Air Europe in Kosovo went down as well. But fear not, they say it's temporary. I'm sure they'll be 
back up and running in no time. Yeah, that's it.
Tulpar Air - December 25, 2013[13]
Tatarstan is a Russian republic that lies about 500 miles east of Moscow. Its capital, Kazan has over a million 
people and is pretty wealthy. So you would think this would be a good place to start an airline. It very well may be, 
but so far it doesn't appear to be a place where people want to start a safe airline. The government started looking 
into airlines in Tatarstan after another airline's aircraft crashed. Inspections at Tulpar revealed problems with 
'violations of established norms for flight hours, failure to observe the duty and rest schedules of flight crew 
members, and maintenance issues.' As you can imagine, that was enough to shut the airline down.
Tatarstan Airlines - December 31, 2013[14]
Remember what I said about another airline's plane crashing above? Yeah, it was this airline's plane. Tatarstan 
Airlines lost a 737 in November, and inspections that followed revealed issues with 'violations in established flight 
norms, working hours and rest periods for the flight crew and qualification standards of the crew.' As with Tulpar, 
you'd think that would be enough to shut it down, and you'd be right… sort of. The airline was told it wouldn't lose its 
license until December 31. So, you still have a full day to fly on this unsafe airline, just in case you're a gambler.

 Market Research Reports, Inc. has announced the addition of 'Travel and Tourism in Slovakia to 2017' research 
report to their offering.
Lewes, DE -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 12/27/2013 -- Market Research Reports, Inc. has announced the addition of 'Travel 
and Tourism in Slovakia to 2017' research report to their offering.
During the review period (2008?2012), tourist volumes in Slovakia increased, driven primarily by government 
initiatives to promote tourism. The country's inbound tourist volumes increased by 4.8% in 2012 and are expected 
to record growth over the forecast period (2013?2017) at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.20%. 
However, government expenditure on tourism is relatively low, and accounted for only 2.3% of the nation's total 
GDP in 2012, valuing US$2.2 billion. In comparison, neighboring countries such as Austria and France allocated 
US$18.4 billion and US$99.9 billion respectively.
For more information visit: http://www.marketresearchreports.com/timetric/travel-and-tourism-slovakia-2017[2]
The report provides detailed market analysis, information and insights, including:
- Historic and forecast tourist volumes covering the entire Slovakian travel and tourism sector
- Detailed analysis of tourist spending patterns in Slovakia for various categories in the travel and tourism sector, 
such as accommodation, sightseeing and entertainment, foodservice, transportation, retail, travel intermediaries 
and others
- Detailed market classification across each category, with analysis using similar metrics 
- Detailed analysis of the airline, hotel, car rental and travel intermediaries industries
Scope:
This report provides an extensive analysis related to tourism demand and flows in Slovakia: 
- It details historical values for the Slovakian tourism sector for 2008-2012, along with forecast figures for 2013-2017 
- It provides comprehensive analysis of the travel and tourism demand factors with values for both the 2008-2012 
review period and the 2013-2017 forecast period
- The report provides a detailed analysis and forecast of domestic, inbound and outbound tourist flows in Slovakia.
MarketResearchReports.com: Travel and Tourism in Slovakia to 2017, New Report Launched
- It provides comprehensive analysis of the trends in Airline, Hotel, Car Rental and Travel intermediaries industry 
with values for both the 2008-2012 review period and the 2013-2017 forecast period
Key Highlights:
- Slovakia's real GDP is expected to grow at a slower pace of 0.7% in 2013, before recovering to 2.5% in 2014, as 
improving external demand in Europe is likely to offset the weaker investments and marginal slowdown in 
consumption. Over 2015?2017, the country's average GDP growth is projected to measure 4.5%, as domestic and 
external economic conditions improve. 
- Slovakia's historical monuments showcase the traditions and culture of the country. These include Bardejov and 
Banská Štiavnica, which feature in the UNESCO list, Spiš Castle, the biggest castle in central Europe, and 
Vlkolínec Village with its wooden houses and churches. Other natural treasures included in the UNESCO list are 
the caves in Slovak Paradise and Oak Primaeval Forest in north-east Slovakia. In addition, Košice was named 
European Capital of culture 2013, which is an added advantage for the city and the country.
- The Slovenská agentúra pre cestovný ruch (SACR) promotes Slovakia domestically through media campaigns, 
promotional banners on websites and newspaper advertisements, to highlight the country's leading tourist 
attractions. The cycle of Slovakia's media campaigns generally runs from before the beginning of the summer and 
winter months to take advantage of traditional holiday seasons. The government is also promoting business 
tourism, as this provides a lucrative revenue source. 
- The Czech Republic has traditionally been the leading source country for inbound tourists to Slovakia, accounting 
for 40% of the total international arrivals in 2012. The Slovakian government has been actively involved in 
promoting the country as an international tourist destination by making infrastructural improvements to cultural 
monuments, national parks and other attractions. With these initiatives, the level of inbound tourism is expected to 
register a forecast-period CAGR of 2.20%, to reach 1.7 million visits in 2017.
- According to the Slovak Statistics Office (SU), the most popular destination in 2012 was Croatia, with 116,784 
trips, followed by Turkey with 90,295 and Bulgaria with 56,790. According to a European Commission report in 
March 2013, 50% of Slovaks did not take a holiday in 2012 due to lack of finances, 21% did not travel for personal 
reasons, and 11% preferred to stay at home with family and friends. Just 5% of Slovaks did not go on holiday 
because of work, and 6% cited a lack of time.
- Slovakia's airline market is expected to see a growth in the LCC segment with Ryanair's expansion. Including 
Norwegian Air Shuttle, LCCs account for 80% of the nation's seat capacity. The country's aviation market will record 
growth over the forecast period. Ryanair has indicated its aim to establish a base at Bratislava Ivanka Airport. 
- The number of hotel establishments in Slovakia increased during the review period, a trend which is anticipated to 
continue over the forecast period. This will lead to a demand for hotel services and a rise in room occupancy rates. 
- Car rentals in Slovakia are directly dependent on the performance of airlines. Charter flights and LLCs dominated 
the aviation market in 2012, and contributed little to car rental revenues. Slovakians are not generally used to 
renting cars, and inbound arrivals and business customers are the main customers. 
- Four travel agencies, Tip Tour, A-Tour, Best Choice and Medina Tours, went bankrupt in 2013. Conflict in Arab 
nations and weak economic growth were among the leading causes. Many agencies also offer similar products in a 
small market. Agencies with sufficient financial reserves and those which did not focus on North Africa continued to 
grow and did not suffer from the crisis.

 Because as someone once famously said, "the best things you learn aren't learned in a classroom."
 1. Contrary to every mother's belief, you won't even feel sick if you eat gelato for every meal.
Or pizza. Or crepes. Or empanadas. Or anything in the top, bad-for-you section of the food pyramid. We're on a 
budget here, people.
 2. Humans are inherently kind.
Strangers will go far, far out of their way to help you get around. All you must do is ask sincerely and thank 
copiously.
 3. Just because something's in a guidebook doesn't mean you have to go look at it.
Exhibit A: Manneken-Pis[1].
 4. It's better for everyone if we just pretend Euros are dollars.
Just forget the exchange rate, and stop converting every price to dollars in your head. It causes too much pain.
 5. Ryanair seats do not recline.
…but you could've guessed that from the prices.
 6. America is not the center of the universe.
There are other people living on this planet, and they live differently than we do, and they are really happy that way. 
It's an awesome thing to realize.
 7. Doner kebab[2] as drunk food is one thousand times better than nachos as drunk food.
Mostly because nobody's really sure which animal that shaved meat comes from. What a fun, mysterious taste bud 
adventure!
 8. Every person in a hostel is a potential best friend.
19 Things You'll Only Appreciate If You Studied Abroad
And sometimes they'll agree to travel with you for days or weeks, after knowing you for a mere day. Voilà! Lifelong 
pals!
 9. Trains don't always depart when they say they will.
…or ever.
 10. It is not only possible, but socially permissible, to wear the same outfit for seven days in a row 
How else are you going to fit your suitcase into the easyJet carry-on box? All you really need are a few colored 
scarves… that way, people won't notice the same T-shirt recurring in photo after photo.
//instagram.com/p/hr4WjLNUZL/embed/[3]
 11. English truly is the universal language.
And people who are learning English looove to practice it with you, even if they don't make sense.
 12. Dinnertime in America is seriously warped.
Why did the Founding Fathers decide to eat at six when everybody else on the planet waits till 10?
 13. Spontaneity is rewarded.
Like that time you snagged the one Euro flight to Finland in an online promo. Or when you bought a last-minute 
ticket to the show in Ibiza. They weren't the most logical decisions, to be sure, but they're memories you'll replay in 
your mind forever.
 14. Nothing bonds you like traveling. 
The way to know if you're truly friends with someone? Food poisoning from the street fruit. Or a seven-hour bus 
delay. Or Wizz Air.
 15. Studying abroad involves, on average, about four minutes of actual studying.
Shh, don't tell.
 16. Taxi drivers are some of the greatest people on Earth.
They just love to talk. And they're so enthusiastic. And they drive you places so you don't get lost like usual.
 17. Traveling alone reveals hidden talents. 
You wouldn't have thought you could navigate a Czech subway without a map… but you did. 
 18. The Guinness Storehouse[4] is a legitimate historical site.
No, we're not proud of this fact. But at this point, it's pretty much true.
 19. Study abroaders are incredibly lucky people.
Very few humans get to spend carefree months exploring the world beyond their hometown, let alone during 
college. To study abroad is a privilege, and an awesome one at that.

One More Thing To Hate The Airlines For: Slimmer Seats

 Monday marked Festivus, a mythical holiday that includes the annual airing of grievances. Well, airline passengers, 
here's one for your list of grievances: airplane seat room is getting slimmer. 
According to the New York Times, an increasing number of airlines are installing a new concept called 'slim-line' 
seats, which are made with lighter weight materials, and include less cushioning. The slim-line seats also reduce 
the amount a seat can recline from three inches to two inches. On Southwest Airlines, the use of slim-line seats is 
allowing the airline to add another row of six seats across on every flight, providing it with another $200 million a 
year in revenue. That's the point, according to a seat expert interviewed by the Times. 'In today's environment, the 
goal is to fit as many seats in the cabin as possible,' said Tom Plant, the general manager for seating products at 
B/E Aerospace, one of the top airplane seat makers. 'We would all like more space on an aircraft, but we all like a 
competitive ticket price.' Some airlines are going an additional route by using seats that don't recline at all. The 
Times notes that these 'stiff seats' are popping up on European airlines such as low-cost carriers Easy Jet and 
Ryanair. They're a feature on Air France's domestic flights, which rarely last more than an hour. On these flights, 
the magazine pocket has been installed above the tray travel, allowing for a tiny bit more leg room. Airlines insist 
that such measures are necessary, since passengers have resisted fare increases and are constantly looking for 
ways to save money on plane tickets. Of course, the complete opposite of shrinking seats is true in business and 
first class, where airlines compete with each other by offering lie-flat seats and even private compartments on 
overseas flights, pajamas included. There's also been an effort for airlines to offer premium economy sections, 
where a little bit more legroom can be had by paying a fee. So, if you notice that you have less leg room on your 
next coach flight, you can either point a finger at too many Christmas cookies, or the airline itself. It's pretty clear 
who most passengers are going to blame.

Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (20 Dec) reminded customers to buy one of the last few

for its charity partner, Teenage Cancer Trust.
And a behind-the-scenes 'making of' video showing the 13 Ryanair cabin crew calendar stars, shot on location in 
Chania, Crete, earlier this year, has also broken records, with over 730,000 views on YouTube to date, proving 
without doubt that the 2014 Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar, and video, are the best yet.
Ryanair's brilliant cabin crew have raised over €600,000 for charity since 2008 and are well on course to raise 
another €100,000 this year. The remaining calendars are available online from Teenage Cancer Trust here[2] for 
just €10/£10, with all proceeds going to help support young people in the UK battling with cancer.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Once again, support for Ryanair's Cabin Crew Charity Calendar has been a huge hit with over 9,000 calendars sold 
so far - as well as over 730,000 video views on YouTube. 
Our 2014 Charity Calendar is on course to reach its goal of raising €100,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust in 
record time, supporting the outstanding work helping young people aged between 13 and 24 with cancer. We

Which? reveals best and worst airlines

 A new survey by Which? has revealed the best and worst airlines to fly with and a little-known airline has beaten 
the big names to win the top spot in the short-haul category.
 Guernsey-based Aurigny Air Services was awarded four stars for things like boarding process, legroom and 
punctuality.
 The company has been operating flights since 1968 and flies passengers from Bristol, Manchester, East Midlands, 
Southampton, London Gatwick and Stansted to Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney.
 It scored an impressive 87 per cent overall thanks to perks such as the fact that a 20kg hold luggage allowance is 
included in the ticket price and its in-flight service includes complimentary soft drinks.
 Swiss International Air Lines (82 per cent), Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (79 per cent) and Turkish Airlines (75 per 
cent) completed the top four in the consumer watchdog's poll.
 It might not come as a surprise to Ryanair's more disgruntled passengers that the Irish airline came bottom of the 
class with a score of 32 per cent. The airline scored just one star for luggage allowances, boarding process, 
legroom and the quality of food and drink.
 But the consumer watchdog pointed out that it had not taken into account recent changes announced by Ryanair, 
which included a move to allocated seating and a reduction in baggage fees.
 A spokesperson for Which? said: 'It's possible the results could change next year, though. Our survey covers 
people's flying experiences for the 12 months up to October 2013
 'But since then, Ryanair has announced a programme of changes, including a move to allocated seating and a 
reduction in baggage fees from 5 January, 2014.'
 The airline is famous for its unapologetic focus on profits and unforgiving attitude towards customer service, but it 
seems that Ryanair has recently decided to take a different tack with its image.
 The low-cost carrier has advertised for a marketing director, reportedly to help soften its image, and is revamping 
its website so that consumers and the media can better access information.
 Air New Zealand (87 per cent) and Singapore Airlines (87 per cent) came joint first for their long-haul flights with 
both airlines boasting an impressive five stars for in-flight entertainment, food and drink, punctuality of flight and 
value for money.
 Spanish airline Iberia landed at the bottom of the table, receiving a 28 per cent customer score, 9 per cent lower 
than Thomas Cook Airlines (37 per cent) who came second-bottom.
 The annual survey of 12,000 Which? members also rated airlines by destination.
Which? reveals best and worst airlines
 British Airways came out top for travel to France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey, while Virgin Atlantic was rated 
best for America and Singapore airlines best for Australia.
 The budget airlines also did well in this category - easyJet was rated the best carrier for Tenerife and Jet2.com 
came top for Mallorca.
 Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, said: 'Our survey reveals the massive variation in the standard of airlines. 
Once you've chosen your destination, it pays to pick the airline that will get you there without any dramas.'
 Despite Aurigny's success, Which? said it would not give the airline its Which? Recommended Provider (WRP) 
status due to the £2 surcharge it imposes on credit card bookings.
 A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'As part of our ongoing campaign against excessive surcharges, Which? 
reviews airline credit card charges before awarding WRPs.
 'Aurigny charges a fee of £2 per person per one-way flight, which we believe to be proportionately excessive. For 
this reason it has not been awarded a WRP.
 'Aurigny plans to reduce this charge in 2014. Once in place we will reconsider its WRP status.'

Christmas To Come Early For 132,500 Airline Passengers Sharing GBP48m In Compensation

Dec 19, 2013 (SourceWire:http://www.sourcewire.com Delivered by Newstex)
 A staggering GBP48 million in unpaid compensation awaits approximately 132,500 airline passengers on delayed 
and cancelled flights, according to law firm Bott Co who have launched an appeal to find the missing passengers.
Having settled claims for 2,500 people across 1,000 flights there is an estimated GBP48m left unclaimed based on 
the average pay-out of £365 and with approximately 135 passengers on each flight according to flight data from 
Bott Co's partners EUclaim.co.uk
With delays and cancellations featuring ever more prominently in the news, more people are becoming aware of 
their right to receive compensation of up to EUR 600 (GBP 510) under European legislation.
As delayed flight specialists Bott Co have already settled on 1,000 flights, across 38 airlines so it becomes a 
simpler process for any other passengers on those specific flights to recover their compensation.
Bott Co hope their appeal for the remaining 132,500 passengers to come forward is spread far and wide to people 
and families who would benefit from the money at a time of year that is always a financial strain. 
 We've developed an innovative online claim calculator that will instantly tell you if you are entitled to compensation.
Passengers can stake their claim to a share of the GBP 48 million through the Bott Co website[1] as Managing 
Partner Paul Hinchliffe explains:
'We've developed an innovative online claim calculator that will instantly tell you if you are entitled to compensation; 
you only need to input your flight number and date of travel. It's completely free to use, unlike other companies that 
want to charge for a letter - we give that away free as well.
'If you're on one of the thousand flights we've settled on then we have a simple triage process to recover your 
money from the airline very quickly, we're settling on more flights every day - more than anyone else in the UK, so 
passengers are better off using our system.'
Christmas To Come Early For 132,500 Airline Passengers Sharing GBP48m In Compensation
Delays must be more than three hours and with around 1% of the total passengers travelling in and out of the UK 
each year eligible for compensation[2] there is a massive 1.75m people every year owed compensation of up to 
GBP 510 for delayed and cancelled flights.
There is little risk in claiming to the overall ticket price as well. The European Regulation 261/2004[3] that sets out 
the obligations of airlines to passengers is aimed at improving service and punctuality - something which is 
beginning to happen across Europe. 
Airlines should be aiming to improve, not charge back to passengers, and while Ryanair has profited from charging 
an EU261 levy for several years, the amount EUR 2.50 represents the maximum cost on each ticket even if 100% 
of eligible passengers claimed their compensation.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (18 Dec) made a 
€20,000 donation to the Irish children's charity 'Jack Jill', the latest in a series of charities to receive support from 
Ryanair's 'Fly to Win' scratchcards.
Ryanair's Michael Cawley presented the €20,000 donation to Jonathan Irwin, CEO of the Jack Jill Children's charity, 
which provides direct funds to families of children with brain damage who suffer severe intellectual and physical 
developmental delay, enabling them to receive home respite care.
Ryanair's scratchcards are very popular with passengers who can win prizes of cash, luxury cars, or scoop a cool 
€1 million - all for a stake of just €2, which funds numerous charity donations across Europe.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Ryanair is delighted to support the Jack Jill Children's Foundation, which does such wonderful work to help families 
of children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions. The Foundation is one of many charities across Europe 
to receive support from our 'Fly To Win' scratchcards, where passengers can not only win fantastic prizes by 
playing, but can also help out many great causes.'
Jack Jill's CEO, Jonathan Irwin said:
'On behalf of the 300 children and their families supported by the Jack Jill Foundation, I salute and thank Ryanair 
and its staff most sincerely. To be under the wing of such an iconic brand like Ryanair is just wonderful and a lovely 
reminder that we are not alone. Every cent raised funds home nursing care hours for children, all over Ireland, from 
birth to 4 years of age who have life limiting conditions; precious children who need constant care. Some are 
brought home to die, where their parents want them, and where they belong for whatever short time they have. We 
appreciate both the money and the mentions via the Ryanair scratchcards. Thank you.'

 MarketResearchReports.Biz announces addition of new report 'Worldwide International Budget Airlines 2013' to its 
database
Albany, NY -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 12/18/2013 -- Budget Airlines Worldwide - International - December 2013
This report provides an overview and update about the current state of the low-cost or budget airline sector 
worldwide. The report is structured along geographical lines, since most of the route networks of low-cost carriers 
(LCCs) are domestic and intra-regional.
Demographic trends and the outlook for economic growth, as well as the LCC business model and current issues in 
the market, are examined in the report's first section, which is followed by a detailed analysis of the LCC landscape 
in the major regions of the world (Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, North Asia, Oceania, South Asia 
and Southeast Asia).
To Read the Complete Report with TOC Visit: http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/analysis-details/budget-
airlines-worldwide-international-december-2013[2]
The profiles of individual budget airlines have been dispersed by region, rather than being grouped in one section. 
This is a logical structure given that the route networks of most LCCs is strictly national or regional.

Ryanair, the UK's favourite airline today expressed its regret at the shortlist produced by the Davies' Airport 
Commission which advocates a potential second runway at Gatwick or two alternatives at Heathrow, but only by 
2030, and again by 2050, long after they'll be of much use to any consumers.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'While we welcome the progress made by Sir Howard Davies' Airports Commission, its shortlist shows that it 
continues to pander to environmental concerns at the expense of UK air transport, tourism and jobs. Now that 
London has three competing airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) the obvious solution is a market based one 
which allows each of three airports to construct an additional runway as and whenever they wish to, subject 
obviously to planning permission. 
The UK Government doesn't determine where new hotels or new tourism facilities are developed. This repeated 
political interference in much needed runway expansion in the South East continues to result in under capacity, 
excessive pricing and a bad deal for passengers.
Ryanair will continue to work with the Airports Commission, but believes that a market based solution which permits 
each of the three competing London airports to develop additional runways as and when they wish to do so, is the 
best way of finally removing the dead-hand of political interference from UK aviation policy and creating the 
additional runway capacity that is so badly needed if traffic, tourism and job creation is to be restored in the South 
East of England.'

Virgin Atlantic To Start Charging Passengers Fee For Seat Reservations
Virgin Atlantic To Start Charging Passengers Fee For Seat Reservations

 A recent poll[1] conducted on HuffPost revealed that 95.05 percent of those polled expect more travel fees to be 
introduced in 2014. And they're already right. 
 Beginning in April, Virgin Airlines will start charging economy passengers to reserve their seats in advance on long-
haul flights. 
 Travelers will be charged $40.65 (£25) to choose their seat on each flight -- $81.30 (£50) round trip, according to 
Virgin Airlines' website[2]. 
 The fee will apply to those who want to reserve seats more than 24 hours in advance. Those who aren't picky 
about window, aisle or seatmates can choose their seats for no fee less than 24 hours before take-off.
 The first introduction of the fee will occur on the Gatwick to Las Vegas route. In May, the fee will be applied to 
flights en route to Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Australia. All remaining flights will see the fee beginning June 1 -- 
with flights to Tokyo exempt. 
 According to the Financial Times[3], passengers on domestic flights within the UK will be charged $13.01 (£8). 
 Charging for seat reservations is common among budget airlines, like Ryanair and easyJet, but is uncommon on 
long-haul, full-service air carriers. A recent study revealed[4] that airlines make billions of dollars off additional fees -
- $27.1 million in 2012.

 One of the oldest and smallest carriers in the world has been judged as the best short-haul airline in an annual 
readers' survey carried out by the influential consumer magazine: Which?. 
Aurigny, which was launched in 1968 and is owned by the government of the island of Guernsey has held off the 
challenge from many larger, more well-known carriers such as Swiss, British Airways, easyjet, Flybe and Ryanair. 
'This is great news and we obviously delighted,' says Aurigny Commercial Director, Malcolm Coupar. 
'We might be small but we try very hard to make the passenger experience as enjoyable and stress-free as 
possible so getting such a commendation from our customers is the best praise there is. To sit above some of the 
most famous names in the airline industry is an achievement for which we are very proud. 'We would like to thank 
all our staff, our shareholders in the States of Guernsey and all our customers for their fantastic support in helping 
us to achieve this accolade.'
Aurigny is based in Guernsey and sits between the coasts of England and France. The airline flies between the 
islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney as well as to important UK hubs such as Gatwick, Manchester, East 
Midlands, Bristol, Southampton and Stansted. It also runs a regular service to Dinard in Brittany. '2013 has been a 
year of planning following flybe's withdrawal from the Guernsey - Gatwick route. 2014 will be a year of action as we 
introduce our new Embraer jet service to Gatwick and we look at replacing the Trislander aircraft. We hope that the 
new initiatives we introduce will further enhance the experience of our passengers. 'All in all, it's a great way to end 
to a very exciting year!'

Government ordered C-section that has been described as 'the Stuff of Nightmares.'
 Forced C-section was 'the stuff of nightmares': Social Services condemned for forcibly removing unborn child from 
woman 
 The case of a woman whose baby daughter was forcibly removed from her womb by social services was described 
by human-rights groups on Sunday night as 'the stuff of nightmares'. The Italian woman was sedated and her baby 
delivered against her will, after Essex social services obtained a court order in August 2012 for the birth 'to be 
enforced by way of caesarean section'. 
 http://www.politisite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Pregnant_mother.jpgThe case, described by the woman's 
lawyers as 'unprecedented', has further highlighted the controversial decisions made by the Court of Protection, 
which authorized the forced removal of the baby, as well as the powers afforded to social workers.
 The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was visiting Britain in July last year to attend a Ryanair 
training course at Stansted airport in Essex when she suffered a panic attack after failing to take medication for her 
bipolar disorder.
 Despite the woman's mother explaining her daughter's condition to police over the telephone from Italy, she was 
taken to a psychiatric hospital and sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Five weeks later, her daughter was 
removed from her womb without her consent.

 Vaping brands like V2 Cigs now a possibility at Heathrow Terminal 4 thanks to the opening of a new vaping zone.
Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 12/03/2013 -- Brands like V2 Cigs[2] have been given exposure as there is now a 
designated vaping zone at Heathrow Airport which has been seen by many as being essentially giving legitimacy to 
vapers as a distinct group of smokers. This has been seen as an extension of the recent ruling by the European 
parliament that voted against regulating the e cigarette as a medical product but rather as a smoking device. In fact 
there are now more than 7 million European citizens that have used the e cigarette either exclusively or it 
conjunction with the regular tobacco cigarette. 
The e cigarette smoking enclosure consists of a 323-square foot lounge that was opened last week means that 
vapers do not have to go out to smoke like regular tobacco smokers but rather will have access to the vaping 
enclosure. This has been seen as boost for brands like V2 Cigs that see it a more of an exposure as they will be 
able to get their users to use the increasing popular e cigarette without the element of stigma that has been 
associated with regular tobacco smoking. It is also seen as sign that there is more changes that are expected in the 
use of electronic cigarette[3] in aviation; as leading airlines like Ryanair have for a while been allowing the use of 
the smoking device during flights without any problems.
According to electronic cigarette reviews[4] previously brands like V2 Cigs had to have their smokers have to us e 
the smoking devices outside the London terminal like the traditional tobacco smokers do. But now located in 
Terminal 4 by the duty-free shops it has been positioned near the international terminal so as to be able to 
accommodate the international travelers flying out of and into the UK to be able to access and enjoy their electronic 
cigarettes.
Whilst there have not been any conclusive tests that can claim the products made by leading brands like V2 Cigs 
are adverse to the human body or that they can assist those with a smoking habit they wish to break. Yet there are 
a large growing number of people that claim they are now having a better lifestyle thanks to the best e cigarette[5].

Air France / KLM Rejects an Alitalia Acquisition While the Vultures Circle
Air France/KLM Rejects an Alitalia Acquisition While the Vultures Circle

 I'll admit that the last couple of years have been rough for me. Alitalia, which I long ago dubbed the worst airline 
ever[1], has been very quiet. It was under new leadership, working on combining with AirOne, and it wasn't making 
headlines. Those were dark times, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. It turns out that Alitalia was being 
very quiet for one reason… it was too busy burning through a silly amount of cash. This means the airline is back 
where it belongs: at the bottom.
My last update was back in February[2], and a lot has happened since then. The short version of the story? Alitalia 
is a mess and came close to running out of cash (again). The competitive situation now looks even worse with low 
cost carriers circling, adding large new bases in Italy. Meanwhile, Alitalia has basically put all its hopes on the 
French and the Dutch. The response from the anointed savior? Um, no.
 Air France/KLM is not only a SkyTeam and Transatlantic joint venture partner, but it's also a 25 percent owner of 
Alitalia. The assumption has long been that eventually Air France/KLM would take over Alitalia and then keep the 
brand flying. There's only one problem with that. Air France/KLM isn't going for it.
 Alitalia decided it needed 300 million euros, so it went out looking for existing shareholders to chip in so that their 
stakes weren't diluted. Air France/KLM responded by writing off its stake in Alitalia[3]. Oh, and it won't be 
participating in the cash call unless there is drastic change.
 Alitalia has promised just that[4] with cost cuts, capacity cuts on shorter flights, and an increase in long haul flying. 
Air France/KLM saw the plan and told Alitalia to suck it. To get their Franco-Dutch overlords onboard, Alitalia would 
have had to get creditors to restructure a lot of the crushing debt saddling the company. The creditors aren't 
interested. 
 The result is that the already-delayed deadline to raise the 300 million euros has come and gone with only 173 
million euros raised. Air France/KLM has offered nothing because the plan is too weak. So is this the end of 
Alitalia? Of course not.
 The Italian government decided to get creative. Since it couldn't give aid directly to the airline, it could strong arm 
others into playing the game and created a back-up plan if existing investors didn't want to play ball. So now, the 
Italian postal service will put money into Alitalia[5]. Why? Oh who the heck knows. I'm guessing either political 
favors or not-so-veiled threats forced them to the table. By December 10, Alitalia should have the 300 million euros 
it wants. But then it'll just burn through that and be in trouble again.
Air France / KLM Rejects an Alitalia Acquisition While the Vultures Circle
 Wait. Maybe this new plan will save the airline. Ha, no, that's a good one. Let's get real. Alitalia is a dinosaur that 
would have gone out of business years ago if the government wasn't so hell-bent on keeping it flying.
 On short haul routes, it's about to get a lot worse. Alitalia used to live on government gifts like a monopoly on the 
most important route in the country, Milan/Linate to Rome/Fiumicino. Now easyJet is on the route, but that's just the 
tip of the iceberg.
 A couple weeks ago, Vueling announced it would turn Rome/Fiumicino into the next Barcelona[6]. It will base 8 
airplanes there and will fly to 33 destinations next summer. Seven of those new routes are domestic.
 Not to be outdone, Ryanair jumped in and announced its own expansion in Rome[7]. It has a sizeable operation at 
Rome/Ciampino today but it will put 6 airplanes at the main Fiumicino airport starting next summer. Ryanair is 
making a push into more popular airports lately (a topic for another post), so you'll see Rome to Brussels (the real 
airport, not Charleroi) and to Barcelona (not Reus or Girona). 
 The best part of this? Ryanair has decided to throw Alitalia a lifeline. (So what if it's attached to a rope surrounded 
by barbed wire?)
 Ryanair also confirmed that it will increase these daily frequencies if Alitalia cuts back. Ryanair has also offered to 
use its low fare flights to feed into Alitalia's international network to/from Rome Fiumicino. Ryanair has for example 
offered to carry Alitalia passengers at one-way fares from just €50 which will enable Alitalia to significantly reduce 
the costs of its feed traffic on these domestic routes to Rome Fiumicino. Ryanair has also requested a meeting with 
Alitalia to examine any other opportunities which may exist for co-operating with and assisting Alitalia in its current 
restructuring.
 Of course, Alitalia rejected this outright (as Ryanair knew it would), deciding instead that it would rather keep trying 
to swim on its own with that anchor tied to its feet.
 But what about long haul? Alitalia wants to expand its long haul flying, but can that be its saving grace? It's 
probably better than short haul, but not by much. Anywhere that has enough demand to support flights to Italy can 
be served by leaner, more efficient airlines. That includes American carriers, Asian airlines, and even African 
companies. It also includes the likes of Emirates, an airline that is already flying Milan to New York today. It could 
also mean the birth of a new, well-run Italian carrier if the opportunity is there. These airlines will not only serve Italy 
at a lower cost but most will do it with better, more reliable service. I'd imagine it would have already happened if 
those airlines didn't have to compete with a bloated, government-backed airline. 
 The bottom line is this: Alitalia remaining alive robs Italians of better options. But that's not going to prevent the 
Italian government from keeping the airline afloat. Just don't be surprised if you have to sit next to a bunch of 
packages from the post office on your next flight.

 There have been an increased misrepresentation of the facts about the e cig, yet the reality is vastly better and 
more acceptable from the facts being presented.
Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 12/02/2013 -- The e cig[2] has been one of the most innovative of all items that has 
been introduced to consumers since the onset of the new millennium. It sought to redefine smoking but in a way 
that is more innovative and much cheaper yet making a better impact on the environment as compared to the 
tobacco variant, the e cigarette has done this and more and there is no stopping it as more and more people are 
looking for a better smoking solution. The latest estimates state that there are now more and more people that are 
choosing to use the vapor cigarettes as the rate of those that are trying to reduce their dependency on the smoking 
devices is at an all time high.
There have not yet been and fully comprehensive conclusive evidence that can state the effectiveness of the e cig 
in terms of being an effective smoking cessation system. But rather there has been a rapid increase in the number 
of people that are claiming they are now experiencing a much better lifestyle now that they are using the electric 
cigarette as compared top when they were smoking the traditional cigarette. And also there has been an increase in 
the number of large scale institutions that are now allowing people to use their e cigarette notably the airline 
Ryanair that has now allowed the vaping of the best e cig[3] products during its flights. 
To this has there has been further claims by vapers that they are being unfairly treated as there are many reports in 
the media that are claiming the e cig is as dangerous as the regular cigarette and in some cases they claim that it is 
more dangerous than the tobacco variant. Yet they claim that in its 9 years of being in the market the products 
released by the electronic cigarette brands[4] have not caused not even a single fatality or causality in the whole 
industry. 
There are high expectations that the forthcoming FDA e cig regulations might be more lenient than originally 
anticipated. This is based on the recent judgment by the European Parliament to refuse to impose further 
restrictions on the vapor cigarettes[5] and that the FDA might take notice and follow suit.

            http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-13-20131107_134748.jpg
 A week after I graduated from college, I took Amtrak's California Zephyr to San Francisco. Over the course of our 
51-hour trip, we accumulated so many delays that by the time we reached Provo, it was clear we would arrive in 
Emeryville -- the across-the-bay terminus for S.F.-bound trains -- 12 hours behind schedule. 
This was, at worst, an inconvenience. At the time--on my first big trip alone, never having stepped foot in California 
or seen the Pacific Ocean -- it was cataclysmic, since it meant I'd arrive too late to meet a friend who'd offered up 
his couch. The appropriate response would have been to ask him to leave his keys under a mat. Instead, I wept. 
Now, over a decade later, I'd want to strangle my young self for not adjusting to changed circumstances with a bit 
more moxie. Back then, I was lucky to be surrounded by more kind-hearted people: Within minutes, the young 
mother who'd sat behind me since Chicago -- with a wailing baby I'd been side-eyeing for hundreds of miles -- 
offered me a room in her home in Bolinas. Three women disembarking at Truckee handed me $150 -- which I at 
least the sense to try, unsuccessfully, to return. Marge and Edward, two retirees I'd shared apple pie with in the 
viewing car all through Colorado, come by to chat. The turbaned woman across from me clapped and offered 
variations of "Praise Jesus," "Praise the Lord," and "Hallelujah" as she witnessed this seemingly unending river of 
compassion. She was only saying what I was thinking: that I'd acted like a fool, but my unlikely reward had been to 
experience the kindness of traveling strangers in undiluted form. 
 I already had an affinity for trains: It seemed, and remains, magical to me, that someone can take one step on solid 
ground in Manhattan and the next in California. That's why, as I settled into a few months of exploring Europe, I 
decided to do so by train -- despite the call of myriad low-cost airlines. (My last Ryanair flight ended with a domain-
availability search for any variation of "ryanairsucks.com," only to find that, of course, they were all taken.) The train, 
I knew, would be different: The train is "Before Sunrise" and "The Darjeeling Limited" and "Murder on the Orient 
Express," which, if not an obvious endorsement for rail journey, at least makes a group-orchestrated revenge killing 
look somehow cozy. My rail travel budget even became part of my apartment-finding calculus: I found a budget-
friendly room on a gorgeous if terminally over-crowded island in Paris that's sometimes so jam-packed with tourists 
that cars driving down its main artery crawl along silently, resigned, as if following a parade of people eating ice 
cream. My rail pass was my guarantee that escape was as close as the Gare de Lyon. 
 The one problem with using Paris as a base for exploring Europe by train is that you're separated from many of the 
places you'd want to go by high-speed trains, like the TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse, for points all around France, 
Europe by Train: Paris to Appenzellerland
Italy, Switzerland, and beyond) and Thalys (Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands). Unlike, say domestic trains in 
Switzerland -- where with very few exceptions, you can hop on without thinking twice -- TGV and Thalys trains 
require a reservation even with a pass. For the procrastinators, there's a lower-level ticket desk at the Gare de Lyon 
that's almost always faster than the take-a-number holding pen on the main floor; occasionally there's a separate 
window just for pass-holders -- and that's where, with minutes to spare, I paid for a reservation on the 2:23 p.m. 
TGV Lyria to Basel, where I'd switch to a Swiss train for one of the prettiest and least touristed parts of the country: 
St. Gallen and Appenzell.
 DAY ONE
5:26 p.m.: Arrive Basel. I had adjusted my transfer time to allow for the purchase of a dozen Sprungli salted 
caramel macarons -- this shop is literally between two tracks -- and I eat all of them before changing trains in 
Zurich. 
 8:15 p.m.: Arrive St. Gallen. After spending a couple weeks in other parts of Switzerland last year, I was super 
curious about St. Gallen and Appenzell. For example, the former canton's name salutes the efforts of Saint Gall, 
whose BFF was reportedly a bear. Appenzell Innerrhoden, meanwhile, was the last Swiss canton to provide women 
with the vote on local issues--only in 1990, and only at the demand of a federal court. After hopping a PostBus for a 
30-minute ride up into the surrounding hills, I arrived at my wonderfully Swiss-smelling (I can only describe it as the 
combination of "the forest" and "chocolate") guest house in nearby Robach. 
 DAY TWO
9:00 a.m.: There's a "Wanderweg" -- walking path -- immediately outside my door, so I take it up the mountain, at 
one point, StairMastering my way up a steep, wet hill and backsliding a step for every four I took. After 40 minutes, I 
arrived in the village of Rehetobel and boarded a bus to St. Gallen. 
 http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-13-abbey.jpeg
 12:30 p.m.: After lunch at Fondue Beizli, I headed to the town's abbey library, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with 
wooden bannisters buffeted to a shine, a massive reproduction of a 16th-century globe depicting both the known 
world and the heavens, and, tucked into a back corner, the mummified corpse of a 7th-century Egyptian, the 
daughter of a priestess. It is very easy to imagine the space being occupied by both 17th-century monks or the 
entire cast of "Harry Potter," on broomsticks. 
 8:05 p.m. I picked up a salad at Coop -- perhaps the only dinner in town under $10, and that includes McDonald's. 
 DAY TWO
8:00 a.m.: From St. Gallen, I boarded a narrow-gauge train, run by Appenzeller Bahnen, to Jakobsbad, where I took 
a 10-minute cable car ride up to the 5450-foot Kronberg. If I'd continued south and I might have climbed Mount 
Santis, the highest peak in northeastern Switzerland at over 8200 feet; as it was, I continued about 10 steps beyond 
the cable-car exit to a bistro offering wurst-centric lunches (un-extraordinary) and nearly 360-degree views of the 
surrounding mountains (super-extraordinary.) 
 1:45 p.m.: Full of Appenzeller sausage and some scandalously expensive French fries, I headed along the ridge 
line, which slopes gently downward until depositing hikers in Appenzell. It's clear this is a trail better hiked the hard 
way: The bemused expressions of those headed up offered a tacit Swiss approximation of "You're doing it wrong."
 4:45 p.m.: A quick tour through the Museum Appenzell: six floors of extremely varied displays, including local 
embroidery, 15th-century banners bearing the coat of arms (a marauding bear, very "Game of Thrones"), and 
myriad depictions of parading cows. 
 5:33 p.m.: Back to St. Gallen, for an evening walk through the old town and dinner at the buzzing Focacceria--
incredibly, for the environs, under $15, and literally half as much as an uninspiring pad Thai next door. 
 7:20 p.m.: Snack run: I stopped by Brezelkonig (a Swiss version of Auntie Anne's, with slightly less-damp pretzels) 
for the two-franc salt pretzel (about $2.20), run by the station bakery for a vanillebrezel (utterly delicious frosted 
cookies, baked, unsurprisingly, in the shape of a pretzel), and then pop into Coop for some bargain Swiss treats: 
Toberlone, muesli, and some Emmental cheese. 
            http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-13-20131108_104141.jpg
 DAY 4
Europe by Train: Paris to Appenzellerland
8:00 a.m.: Knowing that I had a reservation for the 4:34 p.m. TGV from Basel back to Paris, I checked out of my 
apartment early so that I'd be able to visit, if briefly, Stein am Rhein, with its gorgeous, medieval old town and 
frescoed buildings. It was a 10-minute walk from the train station across the Rhine. Stein am Rhein is worth more 
than the two hours I had, most of which was spent taking photos and at the By Noa design shop, haggling over 
ceramics. 
 12:06 p.m.: On to Zurich and the Haus Appenzell, a 10-minute walk from the station--and then off to Basel for my 
final connection on a non-stop Intercity train.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] SECOND SMALL CARRY-ON BAG LOWER BOARDING CARD 
FEES 
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (28 Nov) confirmed that from Sunday all Ryanair passengers 
may now bring a second small carry-on bag on board, in addition to a free 10kg cabin bag allowance, while its 
boarding card reissue fee has been cut from €70/£70 to €15/£15 for customers who have already checked-in 
online.
These latest customer service improvements have been rolled out across the entire Ryanair network and follow the 
launch of the new Ryanair.com home page, 24 hour grace periods (for minor booking errors), the introduction of 
quiet flights (pre-8am and post-9pm), with standard airport bag fees to be cut from €60/£60 from 3rd January and 
fully allocated seating (from 1st February) already in place.
Ryanair will also introduce a 'My Ryanair' passenger registration system at the end of December, allowing even 
faster bookings, which will be followed by a 'Share the Fare' feature, allowing passengers to share fares via social 
media, a 'Fare Finder' feature, where customers can search for fares via price point, route or travel period, and the 
implementation of mobile boarding passes.
New business and family products are also being developed, along with a new mobile app, tailored country-specific 
websites (starting with Italy and Spain) and a mobile-responsive website, as Ryanair continues to improve its 
industry leading customer service and passenger experience for its 81m passengers.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Ryanair is continually striving to improve our passenger experience and we are very excited at these significant 
improvements to our industry leading customer service. We are actively listening and responding to our customers 
so that they can continue to expect low fares and on-time flights, but can now enjoy a second small carry-on bag 
and reduced boarding card reissue fees for those who have checked-in online, along with easier website access, 24 
hour grace periods and quiet flights, with further improvements set to be rolled out over the coming months.'

 The sorry tale of Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi should teach us some valuable lessons about the climate we 
operate in these days as businesses and brands. In this story we have a clear example of how a 24/7 news agenda 
fuels turbo charged and emotional reactions from the crowd - #teamnigella and enough sympathy (for now at least) 
to skew any real perspective. 
Not only that, but we also see how quickly brands are able to react to the idea of being written off. A skill that is 
becoming increasingly valuable in the furnace of media opprobrium. Kate Moss, BP, Ryan Air, Elton John, Virgin 
Trains and Twitter are all example of 'brands' who have recovered from attack and moved on. The vicissitudes of 
the age did not crush these mass market icons. Why? Well we are a 'transmissive' society. Consumers don't look 
up from the mesmeric power of their devices, so many are onto the next brand or story after they have erroneously 
dismissed the brand in trouble. In other words, we actually don't enter into a dialogue. We don't look up. We fail to 
discriminate in the moment as we digest the mass of information. This lack of consideration and reflection results in 
the transmission of undigested information. It's a never ending circle for a moment or two. Then momentum 
changes…
 What this connected world insists upon is immersion, distraction, collaboration and company. As many 'friends' as 
you can muster, followers, lists, and constant communication with as many people as possible. Reactions are 
delivered back in real time, triggered by superficial emotion, when actually what we require is perspective and a 
much longer term, better informed view.
 To get to the REALLY BIG IDEAS, ones with permanence and resonance, what we need more of is detachment, 
concentration, autonomy and privacy.
 'Teach us to sit still' T.S Elliot prayed. How wise. This new world of hyper connectivity allows no time for new 
perspectives and so the constant noise can lead to conversations that are potentially thoughtless and worse 
dangerous, whilst informed detachment can actually inspire a more intense engagement.
 So the centrality of STORY - the thing that makes you stop, that makes you muse, that makes you consider, that 
makes you reflect, that makes you laugh, that moves you and makes you engage - is more critical than ever.
 Today's world of over abundance, excess, data and a dizzying array of social technology requires some new 
thinking and compelling explanations around how to win in a crazy world.
Story Lines.
 We require a longer term view with the ability to react in real time. With a believable narrative, agility, flexibility, a 
willingness to exercise judgement and a skill for improvisation.
 Businesses must lose the delusion once and for all of being in control.
 Be brave. Great stories rarely emerge from a timid culture.
 Find the foundation stories that will help to define issues, set out actions and describe an alternative and wiser 
outcome. Meaningful stories stick with people longer than statements and claims.
 What we see clearly, is that whether a company uses narrative or not, its story is being told in all sorts of ways 
each day. It's never been easier for people to have their say. Anecdotes get shared and amplified so the official 
story of a business or product lives in an increasingly contested space. Companies must learn to compete more 
effectively at the level of the word. Simple, compelling, crafted.
 And there's one last thing. It's a small matter of the truth. Brands must tell it these days as there really is no place 
to hide anymore. The wheel of fortunes, those wages of hubris - business must be able to fight fire and rebuild, 
surviving the punches from that horrid yet satisfying truth that the higher you climb the more inexorably you may fall.
 But it is never over for the smart business. Post crisis the beleaguered brand with the best story will recover more 
quickly. Brands and individuals may well suffer slights and injuries, but with a brilliant team, smarter thinking, 
resilient strategy, perspective and intuitive creativity they can rise from yesterday's newspaper with a stronger 
narrative and a much brighter, sounder future.

Nov 27, 2013 (International Business Times Italy:http://it.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Dopo aver ricevuto molteplici no dalla principali compagnie di bandiera (ricordiamo il lungo tira e molla con Air 
France), a sorpresa il vettore italiano di Fiumicino ha ricevuto una proposta, prontamente rifiutata. Infatti la 
compagnia low cost Ryanair, tramite il suo Amministratore Delegato, Micheal O'Leary, avrebbe proposto una 
collaborazione con Alitalia per fornire passeggeri ai suoi voli internazionali.
 Della profonda crisi di cui è preda Alitalia ne sono tutti consapevoli e così Ryanair ha approfittato della situazione 
per avanzare nuove opportunità alla compagnia sempre più in rotta verso il fallimento. La proposta della compagnia 
irlandese è arrivata in concomitanza con il piano di rafforzamento che attuerà dal prossimo 18 dicembre e che 
include il lancio di tre nuove rotte nazionali nel Sud Italia, con maggiori voli giornalieri in Sicilia (per Catania e 
Palermo) e in Calabria (per Lamezia Terme), così da aumentare il numero delle rotte domestiche a 9 (attualmente, 
infatti, da Roma Ciampino partono voli per Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Comiso e Trapani).
 L'azienda inoltre ha confermato che dal 2014 sposterà tutte le tratte domestiche dall'aeroporto di Ciampino a quello 
di Fiumicino, con l'obiettivo in incrementare dell'8% il numero di passeggeri, superando così i 26 milioni. Con lo 
spostamento delle partenze a Fiumicino, che diventerà il principale aeroporto per i voli da e per Roma, la 
compagnia low cost potrà ampliare le proprie rotte, aggiungendo altri voli internazionali che partiranno da Ciampino. 
Fiumicino inoltre verrà dotato di sei nuovi aeromobili che verranno utilizzarti per i voli business giornalieri per 
Bruxelles (Zaventum) e Barcellona (El Prat).
 Nella proposta di Ryanair vi sarebbe anche un accordo di "feederaggio" dei passeggeri dai nuovi scali di Fiumicino 
per i voli di lungo raggio, così da usare i voli a basse tariffe della compagnia irlandese per incrementare la rete 
internazionale del vettore italiano, nonché il trasporto dei passeggeri Alitalia con tariffe a partire da 50 euro solo 
andata.
 Alitalia, dal canto suo, ha rifiutato la collaborazione avanzata da Ryanair, ricordando alla stessa di possedere "una 
sua strategia, un suo Piano Industriale, una sua flotta e propri equipaggi che le consentono di avere i necessari 
flussi di traffico per alimentare i collegamenti internazionali ed intercontinentali in partenza da Fiumicino". Con i 
numeri alla mano, l'ex operatore nazionale ha anche mostrato che, settimanalmente, dall'hub di Fiumicino 
decollano e atterranno oltre 2.400 voli che collegano lo scalo romano con 78 destinazioni. Alitalia ha poi aggiunto 
che le tariffe annunciate da Ryanair, 49euro solo andata, sono in linea con i prezzi offerti attualmente dal vettore 
Alitalia rifiuta collaborazione con Ryanair . Ore decisive per aumento di capitale
italiano 52 euro, solo andata, precisando che per i servizi di maggior valore che offre ai propri passeggeri, sono 
tariffe altamente vantaggiose. 
 Forte, forse, del proprio orgoglio, Alitalia ha preferito rifiutare, anche se accettare la proposta di collaborazione di 
Ryanair avrebbe potuto risollevare, anche se in parte, la situazione finanziaria e dare una maggiore spinta ai soci in 
vista dell'aumento di capitale di 300 milioni di euro, il cui termine di scadenza, prorogato lo scorso 14 novembre dal 
Cda, scade proprio oggi 27 novembre. Nei giorni scorsi l'Amministratore Delegato di Poste Italiane Massimo Sarmi 
ha precisato che il Gruppo parteciperà alla ricapitalizzazione per 75 milioni di euro solo se l'aumento riservato ai 
soci giungerà ad almeno 225 milioni (a tal proposito, per intervenire come investitore, l'assemblea degli azionisti di 
Poste, la scorsa settimana, ha modificato lo Statuto, inserendo nell'oggetto sociale le attività di servizi per il 
trasporto aereo).
 Fino ad ora risultano sicuri i versamenti di Atlantia, Intesa San Paolo, Unicredit, Immsi e Maccagnani per un totale 
complessivo di 136 milioni di euro. Altri piccoli soci potrebbe poi versare entro la mezzanotte di oggi. Qualora la 
ricapitalizzazione non riuscisse ad arrivare allo "zoccolo" concordato da Sarmi, sarà necessario che i soci 
procedano con la sottoscrizione dell'inoptato, altrimenti altre difficoltà potrebbero aggravare ancora di più la 
situazione non solo dal punto di vista finanziario, ma anche moralmente, con una Alitalia oramai giunta allo stremo 
delle sue forze.
Alitalia refuses cooperation with Ryanair. At decisive for capital increase
 After receiving many not from the major airlines (remember the long and loose with Air France), to surprise the 
Italian carrier of Fiumicino has received a proposal, promptly refused. In fact, the low cost airline Ryanair, through 
its CEO, Michael O'Leary, he proposed a collaboration with Alitalia to provide passengers with its international 
flights. 
 Of the profound crisis which is Alitalia prey are all aware, and so Ryanair took advantage of the situation to 
advance new opportunities to the company more and more en route to bankruptcy. The proposal by the Irish 
company came in conjunction with the strengthening plan that will implement by December 18 and that includes the 
launch of three new domestic routes in southern Italy, with more daily flights to Sicily (Catania and Palermo) and 
Calabria ( Lamezia Terme), so as to increase the number of domestic routes to 9 (currently, in fact, depart from 
Rome Ciampino flights to Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Trapani and Comiso). 
 The company also confirmed that 2014 will move all domestic routes from Ciampino to Fiumicino, with the goal of 
8% increase in the number of passengers, exceeding 26 million. With the shift of the departures in Fiumicino, which 
will become the main airport for flights to and from Rome, the low cost airline will expand its routes, adding more 
international flights depart from Ciampino Airport. Fiumicino is also equipped with six new aircraft that will use you 
for the daily business flights to Brussels (Zaventum) and Barcelona (El Prat). 
 In Ryanair's proposal there would also be an arrangement of "feeder" passengers from Fiumicino to the new long-
haul flights, so as to use low fares flights to the Irish company to increase the international network of the Italian 
carrier and the transport Alitalia passengers with fares starting from 50 Euros one way. 
 Alitalia, for its part, refused the cooperation extended by Ryanair, remembering the same as owning "its strategy, 
its business plan, its fleet and its crews that allow you to have the necessary traffic flows to supply international 
connections and intercontinental departing from Fiumicino. " With the numbers in hand, the former national operator 
also showed that, weekly, Fiumicino hub off and adhere over 2,400 flights connecting 78 destinations with the 
Roman airport. Alitalia added that the rates announced by Ryanair, 49euro one way, are in line with the prices 
offered by the Italian carrier currently 52 Euros one way, pointing out that for higher value services that offers its 
passengers, are highly advantageous rates . 
 Strong, perhaps, of his own pride, Alitalia has chosen to refuse, even if accepting the proposal of collaboration 
Ryanair could raise, even if in part, the financial situation and give a major push to shareholders in view of the 
capital increase of 300 million euro, whose deadline, which was extended by the Board on November 14, expires 
today 27th November. In recent days, the CEO of Poste Italian Massimo Sarmi stated that the Group will participate 
in the recapitalization of € 75 million only if the increase for members to reach at least 225 million (in this regard, to 
act as an investor, the ' shareholders' Poste, last week, amended the statute, with the subject social service 
activities for air transportation). 
Alitalia rifiuta collaborazione con Ryanair . Ore decisive per aumento di capitale
 Until now, the payments are safe Atlantia, Intesa Sanpaolo, Unicredit, and Immsi Maccagnani for a total of 136 
million euro. Other small shareholders could then be paid by midnight today. If the recapitalization is not able to get 
to the "base" agreed by Sarmi, members will need to proceed with the underwriting of, or other difficulties could 
aggravate the situation even further, not only from a financial standpoint, but also morally, with Alitalia now come to 
the end of his strength.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, Italy's No.1 airline today (26th Nov) announced that it would 
respond to the numerous requests it had received from Southern Italian airports by allocating 6 aircraft to a new 
base in Rome Fiumicino Airport, and launching 3 new Southern Italy domestic routes with multiple daily flights to 
Catania and Palermo (in Sicily) and Lamezia (in Calabria) with these daily flights commencing on Wed 18th 
December next. Ryanair also confirmed the 6 aircraft allocated to this new Rome Fiumicino base will also offer daily 
business flights to Brussels (Zaventum) and Barcelona (El Prat).
These 3 new domestic routes from Rome Fiumicino will bring to 9 the no. of domestic routes served by Ryanair 
from Rome, (as Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Comiso and Trapani are already served from Rome Ciampino). 
Ryanair confirmed that over the next 12 months, it will move many of these Italian domestic routes from Ciampino 
to Fiumicino which will be its main airport for domestic services to/from Rome. This will free up slots at Rome 
Ciampino thereby enabling Ryanair to add more international flights and more new routes to its schedule at Rome 
Ciampino, the preferred Rome airport for travellers to/from international destinations.
Starting in just under four weeks time, Ryanair's daily services from Rome Fiumicino to Catania (5 times daily), 
Palermo (4 times daily) and Lamezia (2 times daily) will start at fares from just €49 one way (incl. all taxes and 
charges) which will be more than one third cheaper than Alitalia's lowest fares on these domestic routes which 
currently start at €75 one way.
Ryanair also confirmed that it will increase these daily frequencies if Alitalia cuts back. Ryanair has also offered to 
use its low fare flights to feed into Alitalia's international network to/from Rome Fiumicino. Ryanair has for example 
offered to carry Alitalia passengers at one-way fares from just €50 which will enable Alitalia to significantly reduce 
the costs of its feed traffic on these domestic routes to Rome Fiumicino. Ryanair has also requested a meeting with 
Alitalia to examine any other opportunities which may exist for co-operating with and assisting Alitalia in its current 
restructuring.
Speaking in Rome, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
'We are pleased to increase our domestic operation from 6 to 9 routes from Rome, with high frequency daily 
services from Rome Fiumicino to Catania, Lamezia and Palermo. We are also pleased to open a 6 allocated aircraft 
base in Rome Fiumicino from December 18th to establish what will grow to be a large domestic base, which will 
Ryanair Opens 3 New Rome Domestic Routes, Allocates 6 Aircraft To A Rome Fiumicino Base Rising To 12 
Based Aircraft In Sept 2014
create opportunities for Ryanair to significantly expand its international routes and frequencies at our principal 
Rome (Ciampino) airport. This Fiumicino base will increase from 6 to 10 or 12 allocated aircraft from October 2014, 
when Ryanair takes delivery of its next new aircraft orders from Boeing.
Since Ryanair is Italy's No. 1 airline, it is important that we respond to our airport partners, who are looking to 
ensure that they have secure domestic routes and feed to/from Rome Fiumicino, particularly as Alitalia continues to 
restructure. Ryanair will guarantee that connectivity to Rome and to Southern Italy will be maintained regardless of 
Alitalia's plans to reduce capacity on domestic routes.
We hope Alitalia will take up our offer to co-operate with them, as we believe Ryanair's new low fare domestic 
flights to Fiumicino can significantly assist Alitalia through the restructuring which is necessary to restore its 
profitability and secure the future of as many of Alitalia's employees as possible. Ryanair believes that by offering to 
feed Alitalia's international hub at Fiumicino and by searching for opportunities to work with and assist Alitalia in its 
turnaround, that we can help the new investors and the management of Alitalia to return that airline to profitability 
and viability.
Ryanair's three new domestic routes from Rome Fiumicino to Catania, Lamezia and Palermo go on sale today at 
fares that start from just €49 one way and these low fares will enable many thousands of Italian families to return 
home to the South of Italy or Sicily in time for the Christmas celebrations.'

 Escape the cold realities of winter and take a vacation ... for a bargain-basement price. From hot spots like Mexico 
and biodiverse Ecuador to the bright lights of big cities like New York and Budapest, these destinations offer a 
welcome change of pace from the cold and dreary grind.
 I've monitored trends, industry news, and sale patterns to point you in the direction of places that offer the best 
bargain values for the coming season. Below you'll find examples of deals presently available for winter trips. Like 
all deals, these are sure to expire; however, a little exploration on your part can yield similar results when you're 
ready to book. 
 Charleston, South Carolina
 This genteel Southern city of romantic BBs, antebellum homes, and historical sites is a go-to spot in winter, when 
the warm-weather crowds are gone and the air remains relatively temperate (in February, highs often reach into the 
60s). 
 Recently named one of the South's "great eating towns" by the New York Times, Charleston hosts its Restaurant 
Week[1] from January 8 through 19. Indulge in affordably priced fare (three courses for $40) at a number of highly 
rated restaurants, including the Peninsula Grill at the Relais Chateaux Planters Inn[2]. Along with Restaurant Week-
themed hotel packages[3] available through the Charleston Area Convention Visitors Bureau, several properties are 
offering inexpensive nightly rates throughout the winter. We uncovered midweek rates for less than $250 per night, 
even at four- and five-star properties, so check discount sites like Tingo and Orbitz for up-to-the-minute rates. 
 And for savings beyond restaurants, peruse a list of coupons on the Charleston CVB website[4], where budget-
minded travelers can find dining and admissions discounts at attractions throughout the city all winter long.
 Budapest, Hungary 
 In 2013, Budapest earned a spot on our list of Europe's Most Affordable Cities[5], and for good reason: With a 
favorable exchange rate from the forint to the U.S. dollar, plus an average night's hotel stay going for less than a 
hundred bucks, this hotbed of Hungarian culture is a reasonably priced alternative to cities like Vienna and Paris. 
This winter, take advantage of Budapest's usual year-round affordability with the winter promotion[6] from 
Hungary's tourism bureau, which offers one-night-free deals at more than 50 hotels in Budapest, discounts on bus 
and sightseeing tours, and half-off admission to the city's famous spas. (For the ultimate winter warm-up, check out 
the grandiose Szechenyi Baths, with 15 spring-fed thermal pools.) Also look into the Budapest Card[7], which offers 
discounts on admissions to the city's zoo, opera, museums, baths, and pools; a 24-hour card goes for about $20.
Top Five Bargain Destinations for Winter 2013/2014
 For flight deals to Hungary, sign up for our Fare Alerts[8]. And if you're planning a multicity trip, low-cost carriers 
like Ryanair make travel to Hungary from other European hubs simple and cheap, with fares for as little as €9 
(about $12).
 Los Cabos, Mexico
 On the very southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula sits this breathtaking region of ritzy resorts and 
world-renowned sportfishing. Los Cabos' multitude of luxury hotels tend to be pricey, and the pleasant weather 
makes winter the high season here, but new airfare service and several package deals make it an economical 
option nevertheless.
 Aeromexico launches a nonstop flight from New York's JFK to San Jose del Cabo beginning on January 18. Low 
January and February fares can also be found on American Airlines (with nonstop flights from Los Angeles) and 
Spirit (with one-stop flights from Portland, Oregon); both prices hover in the $300s. And expect increased price 
competition to result in lower fares throughout the winter season, before the spring breakers fill up the hotels.
 Accommodations options abound, with wintertime package deals[9] from Alaska Airlines that include food and 
beverage credits and 50 percent savings off rack rates at more than a dozen Los Cabos properties. And Pleasant 
Holidays' March Travel Promotion[10] features exclusive, reduced rates from just $75 per night plus a bevy of 
added benefits like free Wi-Fi and kids' programs at resorts in Mexico; or check Pleasant Holidays' list of Los Cabos 
vacation packages here[11].
 New York, New York 
 The Big Apple is known for having some of the priciest hotel rooms in the world, with an average rate of around 
$320 per night (and December rates running well past the $500 mark). However, experts know that prices to New 
York City often fall dramatically after the holidays, when gift buying has emptied wallets and after the Times Square 
ball has dropped. 
 For irresistibly cheap rates at some of Manhattan's hippest stays, take advantage of Hotel Week NYC[12], which 
runs from January 3 through 12 at properties like the Gansevoort Park Avenue, THE OUT NYC, and the Ace Hotel 
New York. Rooms are all $100, $200, or $300 per night; book directly through the property and ask for Hotel Week 
rates. Check out further discounts on Travelzoo's New York page[13], which, as of press time, includes up to 50 
percent off room rates through March.
 Flights to NYC are generally inexpensive, with frequent service from most major airlines. A worthy alternative to the 
stresses of flying, Amtrak runs seasonal deals[14] on train travel; currently, book in advance for savings of up to 25 
percent on Northeast Regional coach fares, with service between New York and Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, 
Boston, and other Northeast hubs.
 Ecuador 
 Ecuador is as diverse as one could wish for in a destination, from its UNESCO World Heritage capital city 
unaltered by time to its pristine islands occupied by sea lions, turtles, prehistoric iguanas, and other exotic flora and 
fauna. Ecuador is hoping to cash in on increased South American travel by ramping up its tourism budget and 
infrastructure, including a brand-new airport in Quito. The result? Round-trip flights can be found for less than $500, 
according to Travelzoo[15]. Indeed, we uncovered flights from just $447 from New York City to Guayaquil from 
January through March via American Airlines. And to reach the unspoiled shores of the Galapagos, find 
inexpensive airfare from South American airline LAN, currently running a special[16] with round-trips from Quito to 
the Galapagos from $349 for travel before March 31.
 Air-and-accommodations packages are a convenient option for travelers to this as-yet-undiscovered country, and 
several are being offered at decent discounts. For instance, find 15 percent off package adventures[17] beginning in 
February 2014 via Intrepid Travel or nine-day tour packages[18] with adventure outfitter G Adventures for just $899 
in February.

The 10 Most Sketchy-Sounding Airline Names, In Order

 Budget airlines[1] like Ryanair[2] and easyJet[3] are known for skimping on everything from reclining seats[4] to 
airport check-in[5] in an effort to cut costs and bring us the cheapest tickets in the industry. 
 One element that costs zero dollars, however, is an airline's name. Even though they cost nothing to think up, the 
names of budget airlines always manage to sound, well, cheap. 
 Here are the sketchiest ones we know of, in order.
 10. Wizz Air (Hungary)
Further sketch-ified by the punctuation mark they've decided to use for the 'i.'
 9. WOW Air (Iceland)
As in 'WOW, that aircraft looks unsteady.'
 8. Cebu Pacific (Philippines)
A cebu is a large, cow-like mammal[6] characterized by 'a fatty hump on its shoulders, drooping ears and large 
dewlap.' We're not quite sure what that implies about this airline.
 7. Firefly (Malaysia)
When we think of hurtling from nation to nation 30,000 feet above the ground, a firefly is not the animal that comes 
to mind.
 6. Tigerair (Singapore)
Tigers can't fly.
 5. Lion Air (Indonesia)
…and neither can lions.
 4. Scoot (Singapore)
To 'scoot' implies a jerking, tugging motion that just makes us uncomfortable to think of while soaring in the air. Plus 
it kinda sounds like a household cleaning supply.
The 10 Most Sketchy-Sounding Airline Names, In Order
 3. Mango (South Africa)
What do you mean, South Africa? Like, the flight crew is sweet like mango? The plane hangs high in the air like an 
unripe mango? It's going to… fall to the ground like a mango?
 2. Peach (Japan)
Same questions for you, Japan.
 1. Solar Air (Thailand)
This name suggests that we will be flying in air that is close to the sun. The sun, however, should not be in our flight 
path in the first place.

Nov 21, 2013 (LETA (Latvia National News Agency):http://feeds.feedblitz.com/prorssleta Delivered by Newstex)
 Vilnius: Kaunas District Municipality Council approved the Detailed Territory Plan for Kaunas Airport, Kaunas 
Airport informs. The new Detailed Territory Plan will not only allow Kaunas Airport to implement the scheduled 
projects, but also open up new opportunities to attract Lithuanian and foreign investors.
 The main objectives of the Detailed Territory Plan were to assess the condition of Kaunas Airport and the real need 
for the development, determining the modes for the management and use of the territory. It also provides a corridor 
of communications and engineering utility lines, establishes the sanitary protection zone of Kaunas Airport, and 
conversion of the forest land to other land uses.
 'The new Detailed Territory Plan will allow implementing the long-term Kaunas Airport development strategy. It will 
offer the opportunity for the airport to create a modern, attractive centre for aviation and non-aviation services. We 
will become even more attractive to investors', said General Manager at Interim Jonas Gurskas.
 The Air Park project being implemented in conjunction with Kaunas Free Economic Zone (FEZ) is expected to 
attract new investors and in the future it will connect the territories of the FEZ and Kaunas Airport, to cover the area 
240 ha. This project is being presented to foreign investors, inviting them to set up airline bases and MRO service 
terminals in Kaunas.
 Currently Kaunas Airport implements aviation business development projects of FL Technics and Ryanair 
companies - construction of aircraft maintenance hangars. The aviation training centre situated in Kaunas Airport is 
already operated by DOT LT airline, Aviabaltika aviation company provides helicopter maintenance services as 
well, and the Ryanair's first maintenance hangar was established in Lithuania at Kaunas Airport in the beginning of 
the year.

15 Of The Most Intense People In The World

Nov 22, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Some people get ahead by being smarter, more analytical, or more strategic than everyone around them. But 
many of the most successful people combine some or all of those traits with a signature doggedness — wanting 
success more than anyone else.
 That intense focus on a singular goal comes across with every interaction, and frequently, when they interact with 
the public.
 We've picked out some of the best examples of people who combine serious intensity with an impressive work 
ethic and massive ambition. 
 Anna Wintour
 Wintour, U.S. Vogue's editor-in-chief and Condé Nast's artistic director, is known for her reportedly demanding and 
aloof[1] personal style. She was the apparent inspiration for the terrifying boss in "The Devil Wears Prada," a book 
written by her former personal assistant later made into a movie.
 Despite a reputation for being closed off and distant, her occasional outbursts are intense enough to have earned 
her the nickname "Nuclear Wintour." But it's hard to argue that her perfectionism and attention to detail haven't 
played a large role in her continued success in an industry where many other magazines and editors have failed. 
Larry Ellison
 The Oracle CEO's hyper-competitiveness and intensity is constantly on display, from his involvement in the 
America's Cup yacht race to his near constant spats with business rivals.
 Examples of his no-holds-barred form of capitalism include saying that SAP executives were on drugs[2], hiring 
investigators to comb through Microsoft's trash, and calling HP's decision to fire Mark Hurd "the best idea since 
the Apple [3]board fired Steve Jobs."
 Kobe Bryant
 In the NBA and beyond, Bryant's work ethic is absolutely legendary[4]. In high school, Bryant would get to practice 
at 5 a.m. and leave at 7 p.m. in the evening, and play teammates in one-on-one games to 100 points. He trains four 
hours a day during the NBA season, even more in the offseason, and puts in incredibly intense sessions even on 
game days.
15 Of The Most Intense People In The World
Steve Ballmer
 Though the longtime Microsoft CEO is on his way out after Microsoft missed some very big trends in the tech 
world, there's no doubting his passion. From rumors he flung a chair[5] after hearing an employee was departing for 
Google, to his intense[6] and emotional[7] speeches to Microsoft employees, you never doubt that he cares very 
deeply about the company.
Michael O'Leary
 The list of the Irish discount airline RyanAir CEO's antics[8] is too long to lay out in full, but it includes cursing out 
journalists at extensive length and holding press conferences to criticize European policies he dislikes. The airline 
became successful by massively undercutting others on cost, and continues to succeed by taking any possible path 
to cutting costs short of raising fares.
 He also has a penchant for elaborate costumes[9], as this photo of him as a Viking announcing new flights from 
Stockholm illustrates.
 Sergio Marchionne
 Running two giant automakers headquartered on different continents and turning around Chrysler takes an intense 
personality and fierce work ethic. One executive once told the FT[10] that the Fiat/Chrysler CEO "invented an 
eighth day and we work it."
 He's known for spending Italian holidays working in America, and American holidays working in Italy.
Tadashi Yanai
 The intense and pragmatic Fast Retailing CEO and founder has created a company in Uniqlo that rigorously tracks 
everything, from folding technique to how credit cards are returned to customers.
 Being the richest man in Japan isn't enough. Yanai reportedly wants to beat out Inditex, the world's largest fashion 
retailer. He intends to have $50 billion in yearly revenue by 2020, which would require massive growth.
 Yanai originally planned to retire next year, as he's 63, but no one at his company has managed[11] to "meet his 
expectations" as a successor.
Daniel Day-Lewis
 Already a three-time Best Actor Oscar winner for his intensity on screen, the actor is the same way off of it[12]. He 
immerses himself in roles completely, to the point where it can unnerve the cast and crew of movies or the people 
who encounter him.
 He spoke in the accent of his character from "In The Name Of The Father" for six months after filming ended, and 
insisted on staying in a wheelchair throughout production of "My Left Foot."
 Maria Das Gracas Silva Foster
 Foster rose to CEO of the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras after spending her whole career there, starting out as just an 
engineering intern. That might not be her most impressive achievement. She was also born in one of Rio de 
Janeiro's most dangerous slums and collected scrap metal to pay for her school books.
 She has a reputation for intensity, straight talk, and putting male colleagues in their place, giving her the 
nickname [13]Caveirao[14], slang for armored police cars. According to the FT:[15] 
 "'I was in the middle of an argument with someone and they were telling me that some place was not fit for a 
woman to go,' she said. She blurted out the details of her own tough upbringing in response, she says — 'I didn't 
have the least bit of patience to listen to that.'"
Masayoshi Son
 Son has a reputation for making big bets, like his recent purchase of Sprint. Past wins include big investments in 
Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.
 "He is a gambler, and there's no question he's looking for world domination," DCM co-founder David Chao once 
told Bloomberg.[16] 
 He's regaining his fortune again after SoftBank grew massively during the dotcom bubble and crashed and burned 
when it popped. Son personally lost $70 billion, maybe the largest fortune ever lost by a single person. But he's 
roaring back.
15 Of The Most Intense People In The World
Martin Sorrell
 Sorrell may once again become the biggest ad CEO in the world if a rumored buyout[17] of Interpublic Group goes 
through. He's a notorious workaholic. A client once tested him[18] by sending a blank text extremely early in the 
morning. Sorrell responded in seconds. And despite the massive size of his business, he still gets intensely 
involved with clients and pitches for new business.
 His high salary has been controversial at times, but Sorrell's fought back vigorously[19], arguing that he's worth 
every penny of what he's earned. 
Marissa Mayer
 The Yahoo CEO and former Google executive is a renowned workaholic, routinely putting in 100-hour weeks[20] to 
the point where she needs a one-week vacation every four months just to catch up on sleep and recharge.
 Meeting with her can be extremely intimidating[21], as she tends to be intensely business focused, rattling off rapid 
and specific questions and obsessing over details others would consider minor. 
 Rahm Emmanuel
 You don't get a nickname like "Rahmbo" without earning it.[22] The former White House chief of staff once sent a 
dead fish in the mail to a pollster who angered him, and leapt on to a table during a dinner and started stabbing it 
with a knife while shouting the names of people who had betrayed his then-boss Bill Clinton.
 Roy Halladay
 Though no longer at his dominant best, the two-time Cy Young award-winning pitcher has what might be the most 
legendary work ethic in the sport. Halladay wakes up at 4 a.m. in the morning[23] to start working out during spring 
training, and does his most intense workouts on the day after he starts a game. 
 Before and during each start, Halladay goes into complete isolation[24] and won't speak to anybody except for the 
pitching coach and the manager. Even a hello or wave from a teammate won't get a response.
Jeff Bezos
 The Amazon CEO's intense management style has undoubtedly been successful, but it can be tough on those 
underneath him. As described Brad Stone's new book on the company, "The Everything Store[25]":
 A colleague failing to meet Bezos's exacting standards will set off a nutter. If an employee does not have the right 
answers or tries to bluff, or takes credit for someone else's work, or exhibits a whiff of internal politics, uncertainty, 
or frailty in the heat of battle — a blood vessel in Bezos's forehead bulges and his filter falls away. He's capable of 
hyperbole and harshness in these moments and over the years has delivered some devastating rebukes.
 Bezos' sarcastic takedowns[26] reportedly include: 'Are you lazy or just incompetent?' and 'I'm sorry, did I take my 
stupid pills today?'

Nov 22, 2013 (Plane Buzz:http://www.planebuzz.com Delivered by Newstex)
            http://www.planebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/home-typewriter-copy-1.jpgHello everyone. This 
week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter[1] is now posted.
 We have a reasonably big issue this week, as we have two full in-depth earnings reports — WestJet and Air 
Canada. We also look at the recent earnings results from IAG, parent of British Airways, Air France/KLM, 
Lufthansa, Ryanair and LATAM. 
 Of that group, which airline posted the best results for 3Q13? That's right. IAG Group. Even though Iberia is still a 
part of the company!
 Meanwhile, there was a lot going on in the industry this week. We have more news on the American Airlines- US 
Airways merger. There was a little session with the U.S. Bankruptcy Judge on Wednesday, but I'm not worried 
about that. I'll tell you why.
 Meanwhile, next Monday is the big day. That is the day that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane is expected to 
accept the AMR plan of reorganization and set them free. Free to merge with US Airways. 
 The chatter we continue to hear says that we should have a formal merger announcement sometime around Dec. 
9.
 In other news, it looks like we are headed for a nasty, ugly, expensive representational election for the combined 
flight attendant group at the New American. I'm disappointed. While membership of APFA outnumbers that of the 
AFA at US Airways, by a significant margin, APFA had been working for months with leaders of the AFA to bring 
them in as part of the process — rather than simply battening down the hatches in preparation for an unnecessary 
representational fight.
 The two sides seemed very close the last month to coming to terms on an agreement that would have allowed 
leaders of both unions to work on a combined contract. But all of that now appears to have blown up — as AFA 
notified APFA that a meeting scheduled for 11/27 would now look at a totally new agenda.
 In a letter that was publicly distributed this week, APFA President Laura Glading wrote the head of the AFA group 
at US Airways and effectively said, 'No thanks.'
 I think we're headed to a representational fight here. And it didn't have to be this way.
 We have the latest DOT Air Consumer Travel Report numbers for September. Delta Air Lines continue to lead the 
legacy carriers in every metric, while Southwest Airlines and AirTran continued to post less-than-optimal numbers. 
Southwest, in fact, posted the worst on-time performance of any airline that reports to the DOT in September.

 However — the airline still managed to take the first place nod in terms of having garnered the fewest number of 
complaints.
 It was a great week for airline stocks. We'll tell you why. We'll also tell you why the New American Airlines will be 
listed on the Nasdaq and not the New York Stock Exchange.
 And what is the deal with the American Airlines A319s and their seats? Is it the fault of maintenance being too 
rough on them when doing security inspections or the fault of the manufacturer? Whatever the reason, they 
continue to crack. Reliability on the aircraft is apparently abysmal as a result.
 All of this and much, much more in this week's issue of PlaneBusiness Banter[2]!

 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE
 QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION
B E T W E E N:-
RYANAIR LIMITED Claimant
- and -
INDEPENDENT DIGITAL NEWS AND MEDIA LIMITED
Defendant
__________________________________________
STATEMENT IN OPEN COURT _________________________________________
SOLICITOR FOR THE CLAIMANT
1.In this action for defamation, I appear for the Claimant, Ryanair Limited. My learned friend appears for the 
Defendant, Independent Digital News and Media Limited.
2.The Claimant is an airline company with its headquarters based at Dublin airport, Ireland.
3.The Defendant is the publisher of the online edition of the Independent newspaper.
4.On 7 August 2013 the Defendant published an article entitled 'Low-fuel flights put lives at risk'. The article 
incorrectly said that Ryanair had 'restricted the amount of fuel [their aircraft carry] to the legal minimum'. In fact, 
Ryanair pilots are permitted to carry as much extra fuel, over and above the flight plan fuel (which already includes 
extra fuel), as they consider necessary. 
5.The article also referred to a legal minimum fuel-reserve which aircraft must have on landing, and claimed that 
one of Ryanair's flights in 2010 landed with less than that amount of fuel. In fact, the legal obligation relating to fuel 
payload specifies the amount required on take-off (a portion of which is the requisite reserve). Ryanair complied 
with this requirement on take-off in the 2010 incident but declared an emergency, as required, on their approach to 
landing because the remaining fuel was likely to be and in the event was, less than the pre-departure reserve when 
the flight touched down.
Independent (UK) Settles Ryanair Defamation Action
6.The Spanish CIAIAC (The Commission for Civil Aviation Accidents and Incidents) issued a report about this 
incident. When the Irish Ministry of Transport subsequently met with the Spanish Development Ministry in 2012 they 
issued a joint press release in which they stated 'The Irish Authorities gave an assurance of the IAA's rigorous 
oversight of Ryanair's operation and of their satisfaction with Ryanair's safety standards which are on a par with the 
safest in Europe'.
7.I am here today to say that the Defendant repeats its earlier published apology for the errors in its article. It also 
accepts the IAA 15 August 2013 statement that they' regularly review the fuel policy of Ryanair as part of our 
regular surveillance programme and we have no concerns currently that any undue upload restrictions implied or 
otherwise exist'.
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT
8.My Lord, on behalf of Independent Digital News and Media Limited I confirm everything my friend, Mr. Tweed, has 
said.
SOLICITOR FOR THE CLAIMANT
My Lord, it only remains for me to ask for leave that the record be withdrawn.
PRESS STATEMENT (RYANAIR and THE INDEPENDENT)
Ryanair appreciates the Independent's detailed and comprehensive statement setting the record straight before the 
High Court this morning, in conjunction with the apology published by the newspaper on an earlier date.
The Independent's acknowledgement of Ryanair's 29 year safety record and their safety standards being on a par 
with the safest in Europe, follows similar statements issued by the Belfast Telegraph, Irish Independent, Irish Daily 
Mail, Mail Online and The Mirror. 
However, our client's ongoing defamation action against Blakeway/Channel 4 in relation to the offending Dispatches 
programme, will continue to be vigorously pursued and brought before the High Court in Dublin at the earliest 
opportunity.
Paul Tweed Senior Partner Belfast | London | Dublin
 PRESS STATEMENT (David O'Brien, Ryanair Director of Flight Ground Operations)
As Director of Flight and Ground Operations for Ryanair, I am very satisfied with the comprehensive vindication and 
acknowledgement of Ryanair's 29 year safety record by the Independent before the Court this morning.
Ryanair cannot and will not tolerate the totally unjustified and inappropriate allegations in relation to our industry 
leading safety. We welcome yet another media establishment recognising this and suitably apologising.
We will continue to take all necessary action to have our defamation action against Channel 4 Dispatches and Mr 
John Goss brought before the Court at the earliest opportunity.

 Kenya Airways is seeking a licence for its low cost carrier Jambojet after the expiry of the flight permit it was 
awarded last year.
 The national carrier mooted the plan to start a budget arm, which will be hinged on low fares due to its leaner costs 
structure, in 2011 and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) gave it one year licence starting last September.
 The licence expired without the launch of Jambojet, which KQ now says will begin operations between April and 
June next year. This has prompted the search for a new operation permit.
 'On Jambo we have plans to start the first quarter of next year. We are looking to start with Mombasa, Kisumu and 
Eldoret,' said KQ's chief executive Titus Naikuni in an investor briefing last week.
 In September, Willem Alexander Hondius was named as Jambojet's chief executive and Ayisi Makatiani the chair 
of its board.
 The launch of the low-cost subsidiary is critical for Kenya Airways to ward off competition from budget operators 
such as Fly540 and Jet Link - which grounded operations and is seeking a comeback - for control of African routes.
 This is a U-turn for the airline which merged its former low-priced unit Flamingo Airlines with its group operations in 
2004.
 Jambojet will have a leaner cost structure compared to those of international airlines. It will be hinged on low fares 
and fewer comforts and passengers could be asked to pay for extras like food and baggage.
 This business model will help KQ tap the rising passenger numbers within the region and match competition from 
budget operators, especially from European carriers looking into Africa.
 Jambojet is looking to compete with Fastjet, which is modeled around Easyjet, the second largest low-cost carrier 
in the UK after Ryanair.
 Fastjet established operations last year in Tanzania and had hoped to set shop in Nairobi but its Kenya plans have 
been delayed by a row with Fly540, of which it has been seeking to acquire majority control.
 Fastjet promised to keep fares across the East African routes at between Sh6,000 and Sh6,900.
 Jambojet is eyeing to operate flights from Nairobi to Wajir, Eldoret, Kisumu, Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi.
 On the international front, KQ is looking at Hargeisa, Kisangani, Zanzibar, Kilimanjaro and Addis Ababa from its 
Nairobi hub. It's also eyeing Bujumbura, Kigali, Juba, Goma, Mwanza and Antananarivo.
 'We are eyeing the people who are not flying right now because they can't afford,' said Mr Naikuni.

Nov 19, 2013 (Deutsche Welle Business:http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Britain's low-cost carrier EasyJet has reported surprisingly high earnings for its business year ending in September. 
The company attributed the success to its low-fares policy and extended customer service. EasyJet reported 
Tuesday its bottom-line earnings in the 2012/2013 business year amounted to 398 million pounds (474 million 
euros or $640 million).
 Profit before tax came in at 478 million pounds, a 51-percent increase year-on-year. The company's shares soared 
at the London stock exchange after the news, bucking the general trend on stock markets on Tuesday.
 EasyJet added its full-year revenues rose by 10.5 percent to 4.26 billion pounds. The low-budget airline proposed a 
special dividend of 44.1 pence per share.
 Leaving Ryanair behind
 The results reflect easyJet's continued structural advantage in the European short-haul market against both the 
legacy and low-cost competition," CEO Carolyn McCall said in a statement. McCall also said the recent decision to 
allocate individual seats to passengers, instead of inviting them to fend for themselves on board, was a key reason 
for the upswing.
 She added the firm would continue to deliver a strategy of offering customers low fares to many destinations with 
friendly service. "This means we're well placed to continue to deliver sustainable returns and growth for our 
shareholders," McCall commented.
 EasyJet only last month revised its profit outlook upwards, while Irish low-cost rival Ryanair had had to issue a 
profit warning twice within just two months and said it was trying to rectify the situation by throwing its no-seat-
allocation policy overboard.

 The newest Which? survey reveals the best and the worst brands when it comes to customer satisfaction. La 
Dominion Acquisitions explain why a business' service mentality can either lead to its success or its failure.
According to the latest Which? survey, Lush, Lakeland and First Direct are the top brands for customer satisfaction 
(which.co.uk). 'With a still challenging economy, many companies have yet to understand the connection between 
customer satisfaction and business growth,' says Franck Benachour , Managing Director of La Dominion 
Acquisitions. For the survey, British consumers were asked to rate on six aspects of customer service, including 
staff knowledge, the ability to deal with issues and feeling like a valued customer. The 3,331 respondents were then 
asked to give each brand an overall score out of ten. The Which? survey rates 100 of the biggest companies on 
customer service and compares brands against each other, regardless of what they sell (which.co.uk).
While Lush is on the top of the list with 88% customer satisfaction and five stars for its helpful and knowledgeable 
staff and leaving shoppers feeling like valued customers, Ryanair brings up the rear with 54% and only two stars 
across all categories (which.co.uk). 'It is shocking to see such an enormous discrepancy between the two brands,' 
says Franck Benachour of La Dominion Acquisitions. 'Customer satisfaction should be the number one priority for 
any business,' Franck Benachour continues. La Dominion Acquisitions strongly believe that consumers want to be 
well looked after and if they do not feel valued as a customer, they are likely to switch brands.
In fact, the Which? survey reveals that eight out of ten respondents see customer service as an important factor 
when deciding which brand to use. 'Nowadays, people have a choice where to go. If they are not happy, they 
simply go elsewhere,' explains Franck Benachour. With 86%, nearly nine out of ten, respondents stating that they 
are willing to leave a brand that treats them poorly, it becomes clear how the quality of the customer service 
provided can either make or break even the biggest brands (which.co.uk). 'Customer service decides about 
success or failure of any business,' insists Franck Benachour.
La Dominion Acquisitions: Customer Service Determines a Business' Success or Failure
La Dominion Acquisitions is an outsourced sales and marketing firm based in London. The company raises brand 
awareness on behalf of its clients and has a track record of providing excellent customer service and increasing 
their clients' customer loyalty. Franck Benachour explains: 'The reason why we can easily keep up with competitors 
is that we focus strongly on customer satisfaction. We want to make a difference to consumers. A shopping 
experience with us is personalised and one to remember,' adds a confident Franck Benachour. La Dominion 
Acquisitions have big plans ahead for the coming year as they were asked by their clients to expand into further 
markets by March 2014.

 Heathrow airport will soon allow passengers to enjoy e liquid dispersing devices soon with the creation of an indoor 
vaping zone.
Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 11/19/2013 -- The first ever vaping zone for e liquid[2] dispersing products like e 
cigarettes will be opened recently at Heathrow airport. This has been seen as a move allows the ever increasing 
popular e cigarette to be used in more and more areas, something that the regular cigarette has been banned from 
advertising. This zone was opened by electronic cigarette manufacturer Gamucci to be used by vaper that use what 
has been called the busiest airport in the world. Many analysts are calling it further evidence of the highlighting of 
issues that are connected with the rise of the alternative smoking devices.
The new indoor vaping zone is expected to be opened on 25 November in the international departure lounge at 
Terminal 4. This has meant to cater for the largely international travelers to take advantages of the new relaxed e 
cigarette laws that were passed by the EU Parliament. It is also expected to comply with EU regulations on e liquid 
and related products that state that they will only be sold to those over 18 in order to limit their exposure and reduce 
their influence to minors. This area will cover an area measuring 30 square meters and will allow vapers to be able 
to use their e cig liquid[3] without exposing non smokers/vapers to their odor.
Sales of e cigarettes and related products such as e liquid refills have been increasing over the past years, and 
many are saying that it is in part thanks to the heavy restrictions placed on tobacco smoking. Electronic cigarettes 
allow users or vapers to inhale nicotine-laced flavored water vapor and are considered by many to be a less 
dangerous form of smoking. Together with the variety of flavors they come in, it has resulted in e cigarette liquid[4] 
being an increasingly popular option.
Yet many governments and regulating authorities are currently trying to work out the best way to enforce oversight 
on the e cigs as well as the manufacturing of similar products like e liquid. Based on the trends by one of the largest 
air carriers in the world, Ryanair, to allow passengers to use vapor cigarettes during flights, the social trends are 
changing. Yet in late September 2013 the EU Parliament rejected the idea of regulating e cigarettes[5] with the 
same intensity of medical products across the European Union.

            https://twitter.com/jpmorgan/status/400782415641059328
 Using Twitter as a channel to engage in public conversation is a tactic that's been employed by a number of large 
organizations in high-profile examples over the past few weeks.
 Focused around a hashtag[1] - a word or single-word phrase starting with the '#' symbol - such 'tweet chats' can be 
an effective method of articulating perspectives and opinion on topics of interest to you and your audiences, be they 
customers, investors, employees, the mainstream media, etc.
 They also let you surface issues that interest your audiences as well as concern them, serving as useful 
barometers of opinion to complement other or formal methods of analysing online opinion related to your company, 
people in your company, your brand(s) and topics that interest you.
 A tweet chat can be hugely useful in creating and strengthening connections between an organization, its people 
and tweeters and their communities out there as the Bank of England experienced recently.
 But is it very much a double-edged sword where things can very quickly spin out of anyone's control - no matter 
how hard you try to exercise control - as British Gas[2] and Ryanair[3] discovered earlier this month; and as 
investment bank JP Morgan[4] found out to its cost last week when it conducted a tweet chat around the hashtag 
#AskJPM[5].
 It was a classic example of being not in control of the message where it was hijacked during a relentless, 
unceasing storm of hostile tweets using that hashtag.
 Yet it's deeper than that. It seems to me that the exercise was one of futility for JP Morgan. While I have no idea of 
the specific and measurable goal they set out to achieve by holding such a tweet chat, it's clear there was no 
structured plan that included one all-important element:
 What is our Plan B if things go awry? If we get aggressive questions or hostile opinions about our business, 
corporate and individual behaviours, our culture, our plans, anything that isn't what we want everyone to talk about, 
namely a QA session with Vice Chairman Jimmy Lee[6] on career advice and leadership?
 Within minutes of announcing the tweet chat, the hashtag was overwhelmed with hostile and amusing/sarcastic 
tweets in almost equal measure, causing the bank to throw in the towel[7] on the exercise.
 But the reputational hit was immediate as mainstream media around the world revelled in stoking JP Morgan's 
discomfort and highlighting its failure - gleefully in many cases - with commentary and opinion[8] that has one thing 
in common: portraying JP Morgan as totally clueless in its plans for using Twitter in this way.
 https://twitter.com/jpmorgan/status/400782415641059328
Beware lack of Plan B in a Twitter hashtag chat #AskJPM
 While this is a 'good' example of the consequences that may result through not having a Plan B (assuming there is 
a solid Plan A), there's a more fundamental aspect of JP Morgan's effort than that.
 I would argue that a tweet chat for the reason understood - that of a QA with a senior executive of the bank - was 
probably a terrible idea given the landscape and climate surrounding big banks following the role many played in 
the financial, crash of recent years; and the public hostility online about specific banks, such as JP Morgan.
 (In contrast, take a look at the positive results the Bank of England[9] experienced in its recent tweet chat[10]. 
Although at the heart of the financial crisis in common with other central banks, this is a largely untarnished financial 
organization, enjoying positive sentiment partly due to a new man at the helm, Governor Mark Carney[11].)
 It doesn't matter whether such poor sentiment and hostile opinion of JP Morgan is justified or not. It doesn't matter 
whether the criticism of JP Morgan and highlighting its apparent cluelessness is fair or not.
 All that matter is that the organization ventured out onto the public social web to engage with with people and 
quickly learned that the landscape they wished to survey is a pretty hostile one, for which they had no plan of 
defence, and have suffered a reputation hit that is still in the news (and will be in Google search results for a long 
time to come).
 So the first question they should have asked was:
 Is this tweet chat a good idea, or not?
 And that should be the start of Plan A.
 'Bad idea, back to the drawing board,' declared the JP Morgan official tweeter upon cancelling the event. I hope we 
see the outcome from that drawing board.
 Meanwhile, if you want review JP Morgan's discomfort, take a look at 'J.P.Morgan shows us how NOT to do Twitter 
#AskJPM[12],' an excellent Storify curation by Gabrielle Laine-Peters[13].
 There is some genuine learning there.

Nov 14, 2013 (Mark My Words:http://www.markborkowski.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)
 Last week, the PR buzz was all around Ryanair's Michael O'Leary and his uncharacteristic mea culpa[1]. This 
week, another combative consumer brand is filling up feeds across the globe: Miley Cyrus and her encounter with 
some of Amsterdam's finest.
 Cyrus's 'outrageous' awards ceremony performances are fast becoming a fixture in our lives. Regular, horrifying 
and compelling, they scratch an itch that some cultures tended to with a vestal virgin, a serrated knife and some 
geometric architecture. It seems as if Cyrus doesn't do something a bit 'youth culture' every week, usually at a 
three-letter award ceremony you've never heard of before, the sun will cease to rise. This time, for those pretending 
they don't read MailOnline, she lit up what appeared to be a joint during a performance at the EMAs on Sunday.
 Props to the pixies behind her - it was well thought through. Where twerking [2]with Robin Thicke was calculated to 
rile up the world's lefties, this latest stunt taps into the grand old tradition of fuddy-duddy moral panic.
 I don't know if you could detect it, but in that last paragraph, the stress was on the word old. As in really old. Old 
enough for references that seem old even for me. Everything is different, and everything is the same. True, the 
sheer number of such stunts that's required of a modern popstar, enslaved as they are to the twitter agenda, would 
probably have buried past hellraisers from Jerry Lee Lewis to Cyndi Lauper. Otherwise, however, the song remains 
very much the same; keep your boy or girl in the public eye at all cost. The music industry doesn't hold much store 
by 'sentiment trackers' and the rest of it.
 There's a lesson here. Lord knows the entertainment world has made a lot of mistakes, but its greatest weapon 
has always been the power of hate to drive a brand. By hate, I don't mean frustration, or a feeling of betrayal - those 
will sink a brand quicker than you can say New Coke. Good old fashioned hate is actually quite close to love. It is all 
consuming, and it drives everything else out of the mind of the average consumer.
 Businesses should learn from this. In a world defined by antitrust and corporate transparency, it's tempting to think 
there's no longer a place for hate. O'Leary certainly did - he threw away all the cheeky charm of his airline last week 
when he claimed that he wanted customers to love him. Rather than worrying about looking friendly, he should be 
looking at the (nearly) 81m passengers who've used his airline in past twelve months and feel confident. Payday 
lender Wonga, too, had an attempt at rebranding backfire on them when a whitewashing video they'd 
commissioned drew scathing writeups [3]from journalists.
 What I always preach is that you shouldn't strive for 'like'. If love is within your reach, by all means go for it. If it 
isn't, however, it's better to be despised than tolerated. People often come running back to the brand that did them 
wrong, leaving the nice guys in the dust. And, if nothing else, it can be much more fun.
Adore the haters

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] RYANAIR TO CREATE 300 DIRECT 1,000 INDIRECT JOBS
 ALMERIA, BARI, BASEL, BUCHAREST, CHANIA, COMISO, LISBON, MARRAKESH PRAGUE INCREASED 
FLIGHTS ON 8 EXISTING ROUTES
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (14 Nov) announced it will open 9 new routes from Dublin (from April 
2014) as well as increased frequencies on 8 existing routes, which will deliver an additional 700,000 passengers 
p.a. and support 700* new on-site jobs at Dublin Airport. This new capacity is the final part of the 1 million 
passenger growth that Ryanair promised to deliver at the main Irish airports as a direct result of the Government's 
decision to scrap the €3 travel tax from April 2014.
Ryanair's growth at Dublin from April 2014 will deliver:
·9 new routes to Almeria, Bari, Basel, Bucharest, Chania, Comiso, Lisbon, Marrakesh Prague ·85 Dublin routes in 
total ·More flights improved schedules on the Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow (PIK), London (STN), 
Madrid, Manchester and Nice routes (from 300 to 400 flights p/w) ·Over 700,000 new Ryanair passengers p.a. at 
Dublin (8.25m in total) ·1,000,000 new customers which will create over 1,000* jobs at Ireland's airports
Ryanair also announced that it will create over 300 new direct jobs in Ireland in 2014, for pilots, cabin crew, 
customer service specialists and software developers as the airline rolls out an extensive programme of customer 
service and website improvements. These 300 new Ryanair jobs will be in addition to the 1,000 indirect jobs that 
will be created at Dublin, Knock and Shannon airports to cater for the 1 million passenger growth which Ryanair will 
deliver from April 2014 following the scrapping of the travel tax.
1 MILLION NEW PASSENGERS FROM APRIL 2014
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'Ryanair is pleased to deliver 9 new Europe routes to/from Dublin and over 1m new passengers for Ireland (which 
will create over 1,000 new jobs at the Irish airports) in direct response to the Government's welcome initiative to 
scrap the €3 air travel tax from April 2014. A critical component of this growth will be 100 extra weekly flights into 
Dublin from Britain, which will reverse the recent tourism declines in UK visitors coming to Ireland. Ryanair's fares 
on these new Europe routes start from €29.99, which is half the price of Aer Lingus' lowest fares (€60) to Lisbon, 
Madrid, Nice and Prague.
Ryanair Opens 9 New Dublin Routes From April 2014
We are also proud to confirm that we will create over 300 new direct jobs in Ryanair in Ireland in 2014 to crew our 
new based aircraft and to help us roll out our very exciting growth plans, which will include significant improvements 
to the Ryanair.com website and to our industry leading customer service.'
 daa's Kevin Toland said:
'Daa is pleased by Ryanair's decision to accelerate its growth at Dublin Airport in response to the Government's 
decision on the air travel tax and the attractive suite of incentives we offer to airlines launching new services or 
increasing passenger numbers. This year represents the third successive year of growth at Dublin Airport on both 
short and long haul services, which is very positive for tourism and the overall economy, and today's announcement 
provides a strong platform for continuation of this trend.' 
Ends.
 *ACI research confirms up to 1,000 'on-site' jobs are sustained at international airports for every 1m passengers

OVER 5,000 CALENDARS SOLD 640,000 VIEWS IN JUST THREE WEEKS
 DON'T MISS OUT - BUY ONE OF THE REMAINING CALENDARS TODAY!
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (13 Nov) announced record sales of its 2014 Ryanair Cabin 
Crew Charity Calendar, which has sold over 5,000 copies in just three weeks, smashing previous calendar sales 
records and leaving just 5,000 copies remaining.
And a behind-the-scenes 'making of' video showing the 13 Ryanair cabin crew calendar stars, shot on location in 
Chania, Crete, earlier this year, has also broken records, with over 640,000 views on YouTube to date, proving 
without doubt that the 2014 Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar, and video, are the best yet.
 Ryanair's brilliant cabin crew have raised over €600,000 for charity since 2008 and are well on course to raise 
another €100,000 this year. The remaining 5,000 calendars are available onboard all Ryanair aircraft, online at 
www.ryanair.com and from Teenage Cancer Trust for just €10/£10, with all proceeds going to the Teenage Cancer 
Trust (UK), to help support young people in the UK battling with cancer.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Once again, support for Ryanair's Cabin Crew Charity Calendar has been a huge hit with over 5,000 calendars sold 
so far - as well as over 640,000 video views on YouTube. 
Our 2014 Charity Calendar is on course to reach its goal of raising €100,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust in 
record time, supporting the outstanding work helping young people aged between 13 and 24 with cancer. We 
encourage everyone to buy one of the few remaining copies for themselves.'

Across the Aisle from Frontier's SVP Commercial on Lowering Costs and 
Building the Brand (Part 2)

Nov 07, 2013 (The Cranky Flier:http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Tuesday, I spoke with Frontier's SVP - Commercial, Daniel Shurz about the airline's network strategy[1]. Today 
we'll tackle the issues of lowering costs and building the brand.
           http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/447932437/
Cranky: You're talking about getting the costs down to where they need to be. How much further do you need to 
go? And how do you get there?
 Daniel: The benchmark is there are two ULCCs in this country, if you normalize costs, between 5.5 and 6 cents 
CASM [unit costs] excluding fuel on stage lenths of around 950 miles. We'd like to get the Frontier business into 
that same ballpark.
 Cranky: And where are you today, normalized?
 Daniel: There's a bit of noise in the way it's reported, but I'd say slightly north of 7. We don't have the seat density 
that Allegiant and Spirit have on their aircraft, as an obvious observation. We are more complicated from an IT 
perspective than either Allegiant or Spirit are. Those are two big examples of opportunity for us. But managing costs 
is in a lot of ways, managing everything. It's managing many relatively small opportunities.
http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/447932437/
Cranky: For example, something like LiveTV? I assume there is some cost to that. If nothing else, the cost of fuel to 
fly it around. Is that something you're evaluating?
 Daniel: That's a good example of something we're evaluating and trying to figure out what the right solution is. A 
2002 product with its weight is probably not the right long term solution. We're still working on the right solution. 
 There's the decision we took to make significant changes to our catering product. Customers imagine that a can of 
Coke costs 10 cents. Maybe it does in a large pack in the grocery store, but delivering a can of Coke on an airplane 
costs rather more. Catering we think should be a breakeven or better proposition. It was a significantly worse than 
breakeven proposition in 2012. And charging for beverages has advantages in multiple layers. We give customers a 
choice. 
 If you want to drink, you can buy a drink. If you don't, you can save money by not buying a drink. And because 
many customers choose not to buy a drink, we can carry less inventory on the aircraft. There's less inventory 
carrying cost in the system and less fuel burn because we're not carrying around as many drinks that nobody used. 
This is a good example of how you get costs out of the business: Absolutely change the product, but make what I 
Across the Aisle from Frontier's SVP Commercial on Lowering Costs and Building the Brand (Part 2)
think is the right decision. Some of these changes are more surprising to American customers at the moment, but in 
the rest of the world, they've been the standard way of doing business in the low cost sector. For us, it's a transition 
but we're catching up.
           http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/447932437/
Cranky: Talking about the American perspective, I think there's a negative view of the sector for a couple reasons. 
One, I think the current players have had pretty poor on-time performance. Some of it is just an American 
unwillingness to want to see this type of change. We don't want to pay fees, even though the fare is lower. Going 
forward with Frontier, how do you position yourselves to the customer? How do you separate yourselves from the 
other competitors from a marketing and product perspective?
 Daniel: It's a great question, and there are a combination of issues. For a lot of customers in a lot of places we fly, 
they don't have exposure to the other ULCCS. But you've raised an interesting point about operational 
performance. I look to Europe, and Ryanair has made a virtue, I know they do it in some interesting ways some 
times, of how good their on-time performance is. We're providing a basic good value service, and part of that is 
providing what you promised the customer that the plane was going to leave at 10 and not at 2. I think we get it. To 
be fair, I think our ULCC competitors are also beginning to understand the importance. 
 But we do today run a reliable business. We're not aiming to be the most on time airline in America, but…
 Cranky: Why is that?
 Daniel: Partly because Hawaiian has a big advantage of flying short flights in a beautiful climate, but more seriously 
there are costs to running an extremely reliable airline in terms of how many spare aircraft you have and how much 
backup you provide. But we want to operate at a good level of reliability. We want to be middle of the pack of the 
[airlines that report to the DOT]. I think we can show customers that they get equivalent reliability compared to 
airlines to which they pay hundreds of dollars more. But we also need to communicate the value. 
 The difference in Europe was that prior to the ULCCs, intra-Europe air travel was expensive and as a result, most 
people didn't do it. The charter business was quite significant in Europe. The US customers have gotten used to 
flying in large volumes. Yes, once upon a time, I've been interested in this industry for a long time, I can remember 
when Southwest was considered a mediocre product because they only gave you peanuts, not meals.
 Cranky: It's a premium product now.
 Daniel: Right, the world's changed. But I think the difference is that it's what customers have become used to. It's 
not going live as a campaign tomorrow, but we know we deliver a great value product. We are giving customers 
choices. We're going to educate customers on how to pay the least for the ancillary products we offer. And we don't 
want to be charging people $100 for a carry on at the gate. But we're trying to make it clear that there's a behavior 
we want them to engage in and the fees will be designed to encourage that. 
 The European airlines have been very good at encouraging ancillaries at the time of booking by offering big 
discounts. I think we have the advantage. It's harder in our home market where customers know what we were. But 
we do have a fun brand. We're pushing a message, working with the employees on the idea that we want to deliver 
good service. It doesn't mean giving things for free, but it does mean being friendly and being available. It's a 
transition we have to get through, but we think the brand strength is actually an advantage. 
 Frontier is seen as a good friendly company enjoyable to fly. Although we had a good product, that was never what 
the brand was all about. And I think if we can deliver the reliable service, if we can deliver a good experience, the 
more times that customers find they're saving a lot of money, of course they'd rather save a lot of money and not 
pay any fees, but the more experiences they have where they save $200 and pay $70 in fees an remember that's 
still a savings of $130, the easier it becomes to get customers to accept that this is a good model.
           http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/447932437/
Cranky: You have taken some flak over going into a market and then pulling out when it doesn't work. You get a lot 
of angry people. Even if you give them a refund, now the other options are much more expensive. Are you looking 
at some of these issues? Is there a better way you can handle this?
 Daniel: It's something we're definitely conscious of. One of the reasons we no longer issue schedules for 12 
months in advance is that by the time we load the schedule, we have more certainty in what we're doing. If we're 
not certain about a market, we try to be better about not putting them into the schedule. Our general approach is 
still to re-protect customers when we can. And our preferred approach to canceling flying is when the schedule gets 
extended, just don't extend the market. 
 We've taken heat over certain situations. Yes, it's a downside. Customers get really low fares on us, and if we find 
that the service isn't meeting our expectations and we cancel it, fares go up. But we will do less of this. But it's a 
Across the Aisle from Frontier's SVP Commercial on Lowering Costs and Building the Brand (Part 2)
great reminder that when these low fare options exist, customers need to take advantage of them. Low fare carriers 
make bets on markets working. We've got a lot of data to help us, but we see some markets where customer 
support is incredibly good and others where it isn't. And where it isn't, the service doesn't continue.

 Ryanair today (6 Nov) welcomed the ruling by the Charleroi Labour Court dismissing a case taken against Ryanair 
by a former crew member, which confirmed that Ryanair crew are employed on Irish contracts, operate on Irish 
registered aircraft (defined as Irish territory) and pay their taxes in Ireland, in accordance with the EU Regulations 
governing mobile transport workers and the Belgium-Ireland double taxation treaty.
The Charleroi Labour Court's decision is in line with a previous decision in 2007 when the Mons Appeal Court 
upheld Ryanair's position that any dispute regarding contracts of employment should be dealt with through the Irish 
Courts and mirrors other rulings in Germany, Italy and Spain.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Ryanair welcomes this ruling which upholds the EU regulations governing mobile transport workers and which 
mirrors similar rulings in Germany, Italy and Spain. Since Ryanair crew members spend their working day on Irish 
aircraft (which is Irish territory), are employed on Irish contracts and pay their taxes and social taxes in Ireland, 
there is no basis for any claim that they should be subject to Belgian employment law '

 Stocks were the fat cat's whisker's as we began the first full trading week of Movember[1]. US markets moved 
higher, helped by an analyst-inspired[2] 2.39% advance in Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM[3]), whose hometown heroes 
have always bean hirsute[4], and a restructuring-related 0.69% rise in Kellogg (NYSE:K[5]), where the Pringles 
pitchman has always shunned shaving[6]. The news wasn't all good for Beantown, however. Its duck-loving Red 
Sox pitcher[7] saw an unloved[8] AFLAC Inc. (NYSE:AFL[9]) go lame, edging off 0.06% even as most other stocks 
ended up. And America's most Irish city felt sympathy pains as Dublin's own Ryanair (OTCMKTS:RYAAY[10]) 
nose-dived 9.38% in its worst showing for more than half a decade. The Emerald Isle budget airline is (in)famous 
for escorting boozy Brits to bachelor parties in Eastern Europe, where they promptly piss off the locals by 
evacuating their bladders on sacred native monuments[11]. (Hey, it has to happen somewhere, especially in light of 
Ryanair's preposterous fee-to-pee[12].) Similarly            http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-

associated with rosy-eyed research took to Twitter to, apparently, help get restroom employees canned[14]. Based

Is Ryanair like Darth Vader when it comes to customer service?
Is Ryanair like Darth Vader when it comes to customer service?

Nov 04, 2013 (Adrian Swinscoe - RARE Business Growth Marketing:http://www.adrianswinscoe.com/blog/

There was a story in the press recently about Ryanair, one of Europe's leading low-cost airlines, about how the 
CEO, Michael O'Leary, is going to start changing their culture to make them more customer friendly.
 There seems to be a few reasons behind Mr O'Leary's statement:
 Concerns from Ryanair's shareholders that customer service issues are having a negative impact on sales; The 
fact that the readers of consumer magazine which recently voted Ryanair as the worst of Britain's 100 biggest 
brands; and A story[1] in Ireland's Daily Mail that recounted the tale of Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar, who had 
been charged an extra 188 Euros ($255) to change his flight. The reason that he wanted to change his flight was 
that he had just lost four members of his immediate family to a house fire and wanted to return home as quickly as 
possible and sooner than his scheduled flight.
 Now, Ryanair has long ran counter to the market, to the demands of customers, and runs a bare bones operation 
that, in many cases, shuns customer service in favour of low prices.
 Their offer has always been that if you want a cheap flight then fly with Ryanair. But. that is all you get and anything 
and everything else is chargeable.
 So, how does Darth Vader come into this?
 Well, let me take you back to the original Star Wars trilogy (Parts IV, V and VI). In the story, Darth Vader 
represents a former Jedi that has been seduced by the dark side of the Force.
 However, over the course of the trilogy Luke Skywalker, one of the good guys, finds out that Darth Vader is, in fact, 
his father. As a result, he works to turn his father back to the light side, believing that there is still good in him.
 The films end with an almighty struggle between the Emperor (Darth Vader's boss), who is also trying to seduce 
Luke to come over to the dark side, Darth Vader and Luke.
 In the end, Luke refuses the Emperor's offer to come over to the dark side, the Emperor gets mad and unleashes a 
bunch of lightning on him. However, the sight of Luke, Vader's son, suffering breaks the dark side's hold on Darth 
Vader and he kills the Emperor, receiving a fatal wound in the process.
 Afterwards, with his dying words, he tells Luke that there was good left in him after all. He is then redeemed and, in 
the end, we see Darth Vader's spirit standing alongside the spirits of his fellow Jedi's, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda.
 Now, back to Ryanair. I warn you that this is a bit tongue in cheek but bear with me.
Is Ryanair like Darth Vader when it comes to customer service?
 I believe that Ryanair is a bit like Darth Vader and despite their relentless pursuit of a low-cost operating model 
they have always had a bit of good customer service left in them.
 However, it took the concerns of their shareholders, being voted as the worst of Britain's 100 biggest brands and 
the tragic story of Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar to help them 'see the light' and to start their return to the light 
side.
 Whilst, I'm not suggesting that Ryanair would have died if they had not embraced the light (customer service). But, 
I do believe they will live longer by adding more customer service into how they do business. And, I'm sure their 
customers will be pleased too.
 The force may not be strong in them yet. But, there is 'A New Hope'.

Ryanair cuts annual forecast again on lower fares prospect

 Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, Ryanair, has slashed it annual profits forecast one more time, 
blaming the deteriorated outlook on lower fares. It said increased competition was also a huge challenge. Irish no-
frills carrier Ryanair indicated Monday its annual profit was set to fall for the first time in five years as intense 
competition was pushing average fares down by about 10 percent over the winter months.
 Just two months after issuing its first profit warning in a decade, the airline cut its forecast further for its financial 
year ending in March, saying earnings would amount to only 510 million euros ($688 million), down from the 570 
million euros predicted earlier.
 Ryanair made a point of stressing that net profit for the first half of the year increased slightly despite a challenging 
business environment, with traffic rising by 2 percent to 49 million passengers.
 Volatile business environment
 "We're pleased to report increased first-half profits, particularly against the backdrop of softer fares this summer," 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
 CFO Howard Millar added on-board spending had been growing, but people had predominantly been booking 
discount fares which he took as a sign that recovery in Europe was still fragile.
 "At the macro level in Europe, signals have gone green, but on the micro level things don't seem to be as strong as 
people think," Millar commented.
 In another move to raise its attractiveness, Ryanair said it would assign all seats on its planes, ending the often 
frenzied rush by passengers to secure the best seats and allowing families to sit together.

 Ryanair has warned that increased price competition and "softer economic conditions" in Europe have squeezed 
profits.
 The low cost airline has lowered its traffic target for the coming year and launched an aggressive seat sale plan in 
order to stimulate bookings.
 Profits rose just 1%, despite a 2% rise in ancillary revenues - generated from booking and baggage fees amongst 
other items.
 Ryanair have lowered their full year profit guidance from €570m to approximately €510m. Unit costs have been 
driven by higher fuel prices. 
 CEO Michael O'Leary said he was pleased with traffic growth and the opening of seven new bases with 116 new 
routes.

Ryanair.com website, saving customers time, every time they make bookings (from end Dec).Mobile boarding 
passes (end Feb 2014) which will allow customers choose to either print their boarding passes or download them to

individually tailored national websites in our bigger EU markets will help more customers to make great savings and 
waste less time by booking Ryanair's flights on the new and seriously improved Ryanair.com website.

In a world where customers' criticisms can reach thousands of their 'friends' in an instant, companies are (rightfully) 
worried that one disgruntled customer can wreak havoc on a brand - at least temporarily. Managers must walk a 
fine line between satisfying customers' expectations and protecting their team members from what can quickly 
become hostile encounters that could be damaging to morale.
 So what's a manager to do? Force employees who work in customer service to put up with rude customers who 
aren't afraid to hide behind the anonymity of social media?
 Absolutely not.
 Here are four things to think about before you side with a customer.
1. Employees will be loyal to you if you're loyal to them
And this is a method that is good for the bottom line.
 About 20 years ago, the Harvard Business Review published a study that looked at how employee satisfaction 
affects a company's profit and growth. The study may be old, but the conclusions are still relevant today: Employee 
loyalty is a direct result of customer satisfaction.
 'Value is created by satisfied, loyal, and productive employees,' according to the report. It's sort of circular 
reasoning but if your employees know that you have their back — especially when it comes to supporting them in 
their dealings with difficult customers — they are more likely to sell your company better and provide better 
customer service, which in turn should result in growth and profits.
 Consider the case of the airline company RyanAir. The European airline is known for both low fares, surly 
employees, and an even surlier CEO. A few weeks ago Colin Shaw, a customer service expert, wrote a piece for 
LinkedIn Today[3] in which he suggests the airline is in decline.
 'Customer Experience is about a mindset. It's about a mission to design and create a deliberate experience for the 
people that frequent your company,' Shaw wrote. 'But the mindset at Ryanair is combative with customers, made 
The customer isn't always right: Why standing up for your employees is good for business
obvious by [CEO] O'Leary time and again. If this is the example he sets for his team, what results can you expect 
from the employees?'
 Coincidentally, in September the company announced that it may not achieve its profits forecast.[4] Some food for 
thought, of course.
2. You can tactfully tell disgruntled customers their criticism of your employees is unacceptable
During the most recent US Presidential election, everyone (I don't think this is an exaggeration) witnessed at least 
one example of a 'friend' posting or saying something unbelievably rude to another friend on social media. It's a 
safe bet that many of the things these people wrote were not things they would say to anyone's face.
 People behaving badly online is nothing new, and it's certainly not limited to social media. Employees who work in 
customer service must occasionally deal with disgruntled customers who flame out at them, writing critical (or 
worse) emails, Facebook posts, and tweets.
 As the CEO of a company where half the staff works in customer service, I have to step in every once in awhile 
and let users know that the way they are talking to my employees is unacceptable. If a user wants to criticize the 
product we make, that's one thing, because the product doesn't have feelings. But Jane and Jessica and Amy, 
three of our stellar agents, do!
 As the CEO, I believe in the adage 'sh** runs uphill.' At the end of the day, everything people complain about with 
regard to the company is my fault. So if someone is being rude to someone who works for me, I will gladly jump in 
and take the name-calling.
3. You can broker solutions that work for your customers and your employees
Generally, all it takes to make a disgruntled customer 'happy' is money. I'm quick to offer refunds when it's obvious 
that we are a bad fit for a certain customer. We offer a free plan and encourage all new users to test out the 
platform before they commit. (Having a free plan, especially in the software as a service space, is a great way to 
reduce refunds and disgruntled people.)
 But many of our users skip the free option and sign up for a pro plan only to get into the nitty gritty and realize it's 
not the right platform for them. They get frustrated and occasionally lash out at the support agents.
 In this situation I acknowledge their frustration, ask them what they want us to do to make things 'right' and if they 
demand a refund, I give it and then suggest they use a different platform.
 Your company should want customers who share your goals and views. If they don't, then you shouldn't worry 
about losing them because at the end of the day, their criticism is distracting and reduces productivity.
4. Sometimes the customer has to go
Evernote CEO Phil Libin recently penned a great Inc. Magazine article[5] about how he 'loves' his angriest 
customers because they provide insight about his software. He also admits the complaints can sometimes be 
demoralizing for the people who have to deal with them, which is why he trains new team members how to read the 
criticism without losing their minds or taking it personally.
 While Libin doesn't say this, there are also some customers who simply are not a good fit for a particular business. 
At ShortStack, we occasionally get complaints from customers who have unrealistic expectations — i.e. perhaps 
they expect support services to be available 24/7 even though they are free users, or they want services that we 
don't provide and are outraged when we let them know that we can't actually build a product for them. In that case, 
we cut them loose — politely, of course!
 Every business could probably trade horror stories for hours, but we're curious to know about your company's 
policy for dealing with dissatisfied customers. What do you do when you find yourself caught between the people 
who pay you and the people you pay?

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] OVER 450,000 VIEWS IN JUST 7 DAYS AS CHARITY CALENDAR 
SALES GO THROUGH THE ROOF
Ryanair, Europe's low fares airline, today (29 Oct) welcomed the news that its behind-the-scenes video the making 
of Ryanair 2014 Cabin Crew Charity Calendar has been viewed over 450,000 times on YouTube in just 7 days - 
smashing last years viewing record. The 'making of' video was released last Tuesday morning (22 Oct), a day 
before the launch of the 2014 calendar and had already topped the 100,000 view mark 48 hours later.
Ryanair's Cabin Crew Calendar stars have raised over €600,000 for charity since 2008 and are well on course to 
raise another €100,000 this year, with over 2,000 calendars sold in just 7 days. The remaining 8,000 copies are 
available onboard all Ryanair aircraft, online at www.ryanair.com[2] and from Teenage Cancer Trust for just 
€10/£10, with all proceeds going to the Teenage Cancer Trust (UK), to help support young people in the UK battling 
with cancer.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Fans have been logging on to Ryanair.com and the Ryanair YouTube channel in their thousands to catch a behind-
the-scenes glimpse of the 2014 Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar which, shot on location in Chania, Crete, 
earlier this year. Once again, support for Ryanair's Cabin Crew Charity Calendar has been fantastic with over 2,000 
calendars sold in the first week of release - as well as over 450,000 video views on YouTube. 
We hope our 2014 Charity Calendar will now reach its goal of raising €100,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust, 
which does outstanding work helping young people aged between 13 and 24 with cancer. We encourage everyone 
to buy one of the few remaining copies for themselves.'

 Filed under: Europe[1], Airlines[2] [ Image removed: airplane on runway and looking... ]Shutterstock / Peshkova In 
this day and age of social media, it's getting harder and harder for airlines[3] to get away with bad behavior. Lose 
someone's luggage? You'll hear about it[4] within minutes of them landing. Serve a bad meal? Expect that to go 
viral on Instagram. If your customer service isn't spot-on, you'll be sure to hear about it.
But one airline has consistently refused to bow to customer requests. Ryanair is known for the kind of service that 
elicits complaints. In fact there are entire websites[5] dedicated to documenting how much people are frustrated 
with what happens aboard Ryanair planes. But despite complaints, Ryanair has managed to find its way to the top 
of Europe's airlines. Those baggage fees may seem ridiculous, but the airline is profitable for a reason.
Now with the European economy going downhill however, CEO Michael O'Leary knows that the airline can't risk to 
lose passengers, and he is working on making the airline, well, nicer. Continue reading Ryanair Officially Tries to Be

I Drove A Camaro Convertible In The Worst Possible Circumstances — And I Had A Blast
I Drove A Camaro Convertible In The Worst Possible Circumstances — And I 
Had A Blast

Oct 29, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Over the weekend, I was supposed to test drive the latest edition of the Chevy Volt.
 But last week, a manager of GM's press car fleet called to cancel the reservation, and offered me a few other 
options.
 So we set up a loan for a manual Camaro SS convertible instead.
 After I hung up the phone, I started to think through the practical aspects of my weekend, which I would spend 
driving to Boston, with three other people, in late October. 
 The 2014 Camaro SS convertible is not a luxury car built for long trips with four people. It's loud. It's devoid of fancy 
features (where are the neck warmers?[1]). 
 It needs 5.3 gallons of premium gasoline to go 100 miles (EPA-estimated annual fuel cost: $2,750). The rear 
legroom (29.9 inches) is worse that what you get on a Ryanair economy seat (30 inches).
 We were cramped. We never put the top down. Between Friday-night-leaving-New-York traffic and driving in 
Boston (a city apparently designed to make Americans regret the invention of the car) I quickly got sick of shifting 
from neutral to first gear to second gear to neutral.
 But I still had a blast.
 The 2SS trim level I had comes with most things you want standard, including a rear view camera, 20-inch wheels, 
and leather on the steering wheel and shifter knob. 
 A few options, including a near-worthless navigation system and the $470 "black stripe package," take this car from 
its $41,855 base price to a total of $46,360. 
 The interior is simple, free of the ubiquitous buttons and controls that clog so many modern cars. For the 2014 
revamp, Chevy made few changes to the exterior, but it did stick an air extractor on the hood that drives home the 
muscle message a bit more. 
 Most important is what's under the hood: a 6.2-liter V8 engine that generates 426 horsepower and 420 pound-feet 
of torque. That's enough to go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. Frustrated in traffic, my stress relief was revving 
the engine just to hear it. When the road did open up, I could hear every mile being piled on, then the lovely burble 
of the exhaust as the car came off the throttle. So could everyone in the vicinity.
I Drove A Camaro Convertible In The Worst Possible Circumstances — And I Had A Blast
 And that's what the Camaro is all about. It's the modern incarnation of the American muscle car. The teenage boys 
who cheered me on are proof that this car meets its mission: to make driving an exhilarating, if not totally refined, 
experience.

offering 
increased simplicity stand to gain $50 billion in revenue in the UK and Germany and US alone. Three quarters of 
UK consumers say they are more likely to recommend a brand because it provides simpler experiences and 
communications. And one third of UK consumers are willing to spend 6% more for a simpler experience. That's 
according to the Global Brand Simplicity Index[1] from Siegel+Gale, a study of 11,000 consumers in seven 
countries.
 The research also found that a stock portfolio comprising the publicly traded top 10 global simplest brands 
outperforms the major indexes.
 Amazon ranks first for simplicity in the UK, followed by McDonald's and First Direct. Ryanair sits at the foot of the 
rankings where it is joined by a raft of energy companies, among them ScottishPower, SSE, British Gas and 
npower. Also unsurprisingly unable to do simplicity are financial outfits such as Santander, Allianz, Prudential and 
Axa.
 'Experiencing simplicity at every touchpoint is key to brand success - inspiring deeper trust and greater loyalty from 
consumers,' says Philip Davies, Siegel+Gale[2] president, EMEA. 'The [index] highlights that complexity is causing 
brands to leave significant money on the table and is a tangible illustration of the value of simplicity.'

 Vatican suspends Germany 's 'bling bishop'
Vatican suspends Germany's 'bling bishop'

 The Vatican on Wednesday suspended a scandal-tainted German Catholic cleric dubbed the 'bling bishop' for his 
luxury lifestyle, despite multiple calls for the prelate to be dismissed.
 Bishop of Limburg Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst walking out of the cathedral in Limburg an der Lahn, central 
Germany, on August 30, 2013
 'The Holy See deems it appropriate to authorise a period of leave from the diocese for Franz-Peter Tebartz-van 
Elst,' the Vatican said in a statement.
 'The Holy Father has been continuously and objectively informed of the situation,' it said.
 'A situation has been created in which the bishop can no longer exercise his episcopal duties.'
 It did not specify how long the bishop would have to stay away but added that this would depend on an analysis of 
the finances of his Limburg diocese and the responsibilities for its high costs.
 The bishop flew to Rome last week with low-cost airline Ryanair to explain himself to Francis — following 
accusations he took a business-class ticket on a trip to India and squandered money.
 His private quarters in a new diocesan building are reported to have cost some 2.9 million euros ($3.9 million) and 
included a 63-square-metre dining room and a 15,000 euro bathtub — using the revenue from a religious tax in 
Germany.
 The reports have caused a scandal in Germany and sparked calls for greater transparency in Catholic Church 
finances — a reform aim of the new pope who has called for a 'poor Church for the poor'.
 The 53-year-old bishop is under fire over the ostentatious building project in the ancient town of Limburg, which 
includes a museum, conference halls, a chapel and private apartments.
 The project was approved by his predecessor and was initially valued at 5.5 million euros but the final bill ballooned 
to 31 million euros, including a 783,000-euro garden.
 Tebartz-van Elst is also accused of giving false statements in court about an expensive flight he took to India to 
visit poor communities.
 Prosecutors say the bishop gave false statements under oath in a Hamburg court battle against news weekly Der 
Spiegel when he denied having told the magazine's journalist that he flew business class.
 Anger that taxes paid to the Church by ordinary Germans are apparently being squandered has led to 
demonstrations outside his residence.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, daughter of a Protestant pastor, has said via her spokesman Steffen Seibert 
that 'I can express the hope that there will be an answer for believers, for people's confidence in their Church.'
 Vatican suspends Germany 's 'bling bishop'
 Bishop Stephan Ackermann of Treves, in West Germany, last week told Germany's public television chain ARD 
that the situation has 'escalated to the extent that bishop Franz-Peter can no longer on principle work in Limburg.'
 The embattled Tebartz-van Elst has defended the project, saying the centuries-old cathedral complex adjacent to 
the modernist new structure is heritage protected, complicating the development.
 Critics within and outside the church have contrasted the premium architectural project with the more humble style 
of Pope Francis and asked how much good the money could do if used as aid in poverty-stricken African countries.
 Pope Francis has made several key gestures of a more humble style since coming to office in March and has 
condemned big-spending clerics.
 The pontiff has refused to move into the lavish papal palace in the Vatican, staying instead in the Casa Santa 
Marta, a residence for visitors.
 He has repeatedly called for the Catholic Church and its faithful to rid themselves of earthly concerns like his 
name-sake, St Francis of Assisi, warning that 'worldliness is a murderer because it kills souls, kills people, kills the 
Church.'
 Germany's top Catholic cleric, Robert Zollitsch, who met the pope last week, has set up a commission to 
investigate the Limburg diocese.

Ryanair Is Making Changes, Hopes To Improve Poor Image

 Ryanair is making changes, hoping to improve its controversial image[1] as one of the world's most hated airlines. 
 On Monday, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary took to Twitter for a question-and-answer session[2] where he fielded 
questions regarding his airline's sneaky fees and poor customer service. 
 One Twitter user asked[3]: "Does anyone in your organization have any experience of running an airline?"
 But now O'Leary hopes to make things better in the future. According to theDaily Mail[4], he apologized for his 
airline's "over-abrupt culture" and promises to make changes. 
 Strict hand-luggage restrictions will be relaxed to allow small items such as a hand bag or shopping bag onto the 
plane. Currently, a firmly enforced rule only allows travelers one item of carry on[5] -- anything more, despite size, is 
prohibited. 
 Deals will also be offered to encourage "family friendly" travel. Families will also be allowed to book seats together 
and pool their luggage allowance. 
 Another pledge from O'Leary promises to not punish those who make "genuine mistakes" with hefty fees. In the 
past, Ryanair has imposed such fees on unknowing passengers who do not print their boarding pass in advance 
and are faced with a $113 charge to print their pass. 
 "In the past we have said, 'That's the policy - go to hell.' That culture needs to evolve," O'Leary said[6].

 Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is a rather unusual CEO, especially for the usually staid airline business.
 He's known for dressing up as a French chambermaid[1], cursing at journalists, and doing anything and everything 
to squeeze more and more money out of his customers — except raise fares.
 O'Leary recently announced that Ryanair wants to improve its service[2], to win over more customers.
 In an effort to open himself up, he took to Twitter on Monday to field questions, using the hashtag #AskMOL.
 He was by turns funny, rude, and surprisingly forthcoming about his airline's plans for the future. Here are his best 
answers from the chat.
 Things got off to a rough start, as O'Leary didn't really get the hashtag concept:
He acknowledged his recent pledge to "eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off,"[3] but denied that 
Ryanair's performance is lagging:
He didn't apologize for the fee on customers who don't print out their own boarding pass:
And denied that Ryanair's on-time record is faked:
No dice for those who want to see men in the Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar, which features ladies in 
swimsuits.
O'Leary isn't worried about being insulted by potential customers:
He likes the idea of banning kids from flights, but don't expect to see it happen on Ryanair:
He won't consider charging fat passengers extra[4]:
When it comes to expanding London's Heathrow Airport, O'Leary doesn't buy into the "Boris Island" plan to build a 
new terminal on the Thames Estuary[5].
Ryanair 's Wild CEO Spent An Hour Taking Questions On Twitter — Here Are His Best Answers
He was not up for answering questions about aerodynamics and fuel efficiency:
But he did address plans for improving Ryanair's boarding process:
He's no fan of other airlines, not surprisingly:

 A Leeds-based company which offers an airport parking price comparison and booking service has launched two 
new European operations.
 www.Looking4Parking.com is launching its first foreign language site, with the unveiling of its French website, 
whilst it also becomes the first UK company to provide pre-paid airport parking in Sweden.
 The company's French site www.Looking4Parking.com/fr will initially sell airport parking at two locations - Paris 
Beauvais-Tillé and Bordeaux-Mérignac Airport - which will expand to cover all French airports by early 2014.
 The Swedish operation will initially commence with Skavsta and Gothenburg City Airport, with a similar expansion 
programme to cover all of the country's airports during 2014.
 Passengers travelling from any of the four airports will be able to use the company's price comparison site to pre-
book airport parking, saving them money and providing them with the peace of mind of a confirmed parking space 
before arriving at the airport.
 Part of the Travel Parking Group, which is one of the biggest providers of meet and greet parking at UK 
airports, Looking4Parking.com already compares and sells parking products at all major UK airports and has 
recently agreed a partnership to provide all forms of airport parking for Ryanair customers.
 Martin Mansell, managing director at Looking4Parking.com, said: 'We are delighted to be expanding into Europe 
with our French and Swedish operations.
 'Our business has grown quickly in the UK and, now that we are one of the biggest operators domestically, the 
natural step was for us to look overseas. 
 "This expansion allows us to reach untapped, new markets with the potential to increase revenues exponentially.'

 The world's cheapest airline[1] is Ryanair[2], correct? 
 According to some research conducted by WhichAirline.com[3], Ryanair is actually only the fourth cheapest airline 
in the world. So which airlines will fly you for the least amount of money? 
 When flying a budget airline[4], fees make all the difference. WhichAirline factored in both transaction fees and 
checked 20 kilogram baggage fees for all the airlines on their list. 
 Budget airlines are constantly competing to the be the cheapest option for their routes. Just last week, Norwegian 
Air announced they will begin to offer long-haul flights from Gatwick Airport to the United States[5] in an attempt to 
compete with airlines like British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. 
 Check out the the world's 10 cheapest airlines below.

 By: Maleeha Hamid Siddiqui
 Established in 1888, The Financial Times newspaper has a long and rich history of journalism. This year, in 
celebration of its 125th anniversary, the newspaper has come out with a collection of 52 of the best 800-plus 
interviews carried in its weekend edition under the heading, 'Lunch with the Financial Times'. The section was 
introduced in 1994.
 The idea was to have a conversation over lunch with oligarchs, members of the royalty, film stars, politicians and 
other newsmakers. The CEO of The Financial Times describes the section as a 'consistently entertaining read, and 
a unique 'seat at the table' with the personalities and players who have shaped our times.'
 This format was conceived by Max Wilkinson, editor of the Weekend FT. The interviewee chooses the restaurant, 
and the FT foots the bill as journalists try to elicit insights and occasional indiscretion over good food and a decent 
bottle of drink, says the editor of The Financial Times, Lionel Barber, in the introduction to the book.
 Edited by Barber, Lunch with the FT contains interviews, among others, with Prince Alwaleed, the Saudi Warren 
Buffet, and Mo Ibrahim, the Sudanese billionaire, in the business section; with film stars Angelina Jolie and Michael 
Caine in the arts section; with Vaclav Havel, the Czech playwright-turned-president, in the politics section, along 
with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, Helen Clark, the New Zealand prime minister, and Paul Kagane, the 
Rwandan president. The volume also has sections on food, fashion and lifestyle, poachers and gamekeepers, 
sports and thinkers, with the business and politics sections being the largest.
 These sections also offers the most interesting interviews as Prince Alwaleed and Michael O'Leary are a study in 
contrasts. Prince Alwaleed, whose weight at one time was 89 kilos, is eating one meal a day, a regime that he had 
been following for 15 years, when interviewer Simon Kuper meets him at his hotel in Paris. Moreover, at the time of 
the interview in December 2005, the billionaire was the world's fifth richest man with stakes in Citigroup, News 
Corp, Hewlett-Packard among many others. He orders a rucola and tomato salad, which is not on the hotel George 
V menu (which Alwaleed owned) and finishes his sparse meal with a coffee. Kuper's supper starts with an 
appetizer, followed by an entrée and a coffee.
 On the other hand, the aerospace correspondent for The Financial Times, Pilita Clark, is stumped when the cost-
cutting chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, '[shoves] something the size of a small grapefruit wrapped in 
red and white cardboard over the table in his office at Dublin airport.' It turns out to be a pre-packaged bagel and 
O'Leary helpfully adds that it has pesto. 'It was either that or McDonald's,' he says, adding that he 'figured [her] out 
for a bagel girl.' For himself, he gets a 'grim-looking chicken salad' from the airport and his assistant gets them two

takeaway coffees. 'So begins lunch with one of the world's best-known, least-loved and more improbable airline 
chief executives,' writes Clark.
 Alwaleed earnestly tries to impress upon the interviewer his mission to unite the people around the world by 
donating large sums to Ivy League universities for their Islamic studies programmes and trying to influence 
international developments, particularly the Palestinian issue. Notably, this bridging of the gap failed when he tried 
to donate $10 million to New York city after the 9/11 attacks. The cheque was returned by the then mayor of the 
city, Rudolph Guiliani, who accused Alwaleed of trying to justify the attacks.
 O'Leary harbours none of these grand ambitions. In fact, the politically incorrect Ireland native ('management 
consultants should be euthanised') has been on a ruthless mission since he took over in 1994 to cut airline costs 
and increase revenues by charging for everything from checking-in online to a cup of coffee on board. Clearly this 
strategy has worked for the former tax accountant since Ryanair has the highest market value of any airline in the 
world after Singapore Airlines when Clark meets him in December 2009. This is indeed remarkable since the 
recession deeply affected the European aviation sector while Ryanair emerged unscathed.
 But not all interviews make for an amusing or interesting read, cases in point being Imran Khan's and Queen Rania 
of Jordan's. Khan prattles on predictably about the US response to the September 11 attacks (the interview was 
conducted a few weeks later), his interest in politics, his then wife Jemima's religious background and the Shaukat 
Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre. And Queen Rania's replies come across as contrived 
and patronising, especially when she says that she'd rather stay at home with her three kids, and when she is 
asked to comment on being labelled as the handbag queen: 'Labels will come and go, but the most important thing 
is not to feel victimised.'
 There are also a few sad conversations, such as with James Watson, the man who co-discovered the structure of 
DNA, and Steve Wozniak, inventor of Apple II. Wozniak is described by the interviewer as 'self-mythologising' and 
for Watson his interviewer says that 'it seems fitting that his favourite among a batch of films out over the end-of-
year holiday period is Bad Santa, the story of a cantankerous and outspoken Father Christmas.' Most of the 
interviews are accompanied by elegant illustrations by James Ferguson, though not all of them are flattering.
 While some of the interviews come across as slightly dated (Prince Alwaleed is now the world's 26th richest man 
and owns large stakes in Facebook, Apple and Twitter), the profiles are enjoyable and make for fun reading. They 
also provide a valuable resource for journalists and mass communication students who would like to explore the art 
of conducting an interview and want a deeper understanding of newsmakers.

Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, Europe's low fares airline, was today (18 Oct) recognised for its 
outstanding contribution to tourism in the Provence region, when its Deputy CEO and Chief Operating Officer, 
Michael Cawley, was presented with the Citizen Badge of Honour from the city of Marseille. This year, Ryanair will 
carry over 1.65m passengers to/from Marseille sustaining 1,650* 'on-site' jobs at Marseille Airport, underlining 
Ryanair's commitment to tourism in the Provence region.
To celebrate, Ryanair is releasing 100,000 seats across its entire European network at prices starting from just 
€14.99 for travel on Mon, Tue, Wed Thur in November, December and January and these 'all in' low fares will be 
available on over 1,000 of Ryanair's European routes, including between Marseille and East Midlands, Pisa and 
Zadar, but must be booked on www.ryanair.com[2] before midnight (24:00hrs) Mon, 21 October.
In Marseille, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
'We are delighted to have been recognised in Marseille today and to receive the Citizen Badge of Honour. In just 7 
years, Ryanair has carried 8.6m passengers to and from Marseille, with passengers saving over €1.9 billion by 
switching to Ryanair's low fares over Air France's high fares and fuel surcharges. 
To celebrate our award, Ryanair is releasing 100,000 seats on over 1,000 European routes, including Marseille to 
East Midlands, Pisa and Zadar, at prices starting from £14.99, for travel in November, December and January. 
These seats are only available until midnight (24:00hrs) Monday (21 Oct) and at these mad prices are sure to be 
snapped up fast, so we urge passengers to book them on www.ryanair.com[3] before they sell out.'

Norwegian Budget Airline Will Offer London To U.S. Flights At Crazy Low Cost

 Are you an anglophile that bemoans the exorbitant price of transatlantic flights to London? Well, we've got some 
good news for you. 
 Beginning in July 2014, budget airline Norwegian[1] will offer flights from New York, Los Angeles and Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., to Gatwick Airport starting at £149 (that's just over $240), the Guardian[2] reports. 
 Norwegian is comparable to Ryanair, with slightly better amenities. Flying budget across the Atlantic Ocean doesn't 
sound like the most comfortable situation but, at the price, it's an attractive option. 
 Travelers on Norwegian's long-haul flights will fly on new Boeing Dreamliners[3]. The airline will offer seat-back in-
flight entertainment systems for free, but charge extra (£30, approximately $50) for a package that will include 
meals, luggage and reserved seating. 
 Even with the added charge for amenities, Norwegian's flights will still be a steal. According to Skyscanner[4], the 
cheapest flight to London last month was £349 or $565. 
 Norwegian will compete with popular New York to London air carries like British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which 
generally charge much higher air fares but have more amenities and fly into Heathrow Airport. 
 "There's great demand for high-quality flights at a low fare between the UK and the US, particularly to and from 
Gatwick," Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian's chief executive, said[5]. "It shows the benefits to passengers of Gatwick 
competing with Heathrow on routes, price and service."
 The airline plans on having three weekly New York to London flights and twice weekly flights to Los Angeles and 
Fort Lauderdale. 
 Would you fly on one of Norwegian's long-haul flights? Let us know in the comments!

 Have you ever complained about flying Ryanair? If so, the airline is ready and willing to take your suggestions. 
 The oft-maligned Irish airline[1] is a favorite of budget travelers and students studying abroad in Europe. Well, 
favorite is a loose term... the love-to-hate airline offers cheap flights, but at what cost?
 Complaints about Ryanair range from the tight seating to sneaky exorbitant fees to the flight attendants who 
attempt to sell all kind of products on board. There's even a website dedicated to hating Ryanair[2]. 
 However, that all could change. The Telegraph reports[3] that Ryanair's website now features a suggestion form[4], 
preceded by a letter from Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary. The letter reads: 
 Dear Customer,
 Over the past 29 years Ryanair has grown from carrying 200,000 to over 81 million customers annually by offering 
lower fares, great service and choice to Europe's air travellers. No other airline can match our low fares, our on-time 
arrivals, our tiny rate of cancellations, or lost bags, or our new fleet of over 300 aircraft.
 But we want to keep improving our services, which is where you can help me. Please send me your suggestions as 
to how Ryanair can further improve our industry leading customer service.
 All suggestions will be gratefully acknowledged by me. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
 Many thanks
 Michael O'Leary
Da Boss ☺
 The best part has to be that smiley face. Michael O'Leary, you may not be the most likable dude[5], but it seems 
you have a sense of humor. 
 What sort of "suggestions" will you be sending?

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] 1,000 NEW TOURISM JOBS TO BE CREATED FROM APRIL AS 
RYANAIR RESPONDS TO GOVERNMENT WITHDRAWAL OF TOURIST TAX 
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (16Oct) announced plans to grow its traffic at its Irish airports by at least 
1m passengers p.a. from April 2014 in a direct response to the Govt's announcement in yesterday's budget that the 
€3 travel tax (which applies only to air passengers) will be scrapped in April 2014.
Ryanair highlighted that since the travel tax was introduced in January 2009, traffic at the main Irish airports had 
declined from 30.5m passengers in 2008 to 23.5m in 2012. Ryanair believes that much of this traffic can now be 
recovered thanks to the abolition of the travel tax, which makes Ireland a more competitive and attractive 
destination for inbound visitors, particularly those on short flights from the UK and Continental Europe. 
Ryanair will now respond positively to the Govt's initiative and announce plans to grow traffic to/from its Irish 
airports by at least 1m passengers p.a. from April 2014. Ryanair has invited all the main Irish airports - Dublin, Cork, 
Shannon, Knock and Kerry - to meetings in Dublin on Thursday and Friday of this week to finalise these growth 
plans and how it can be split between the airports. These 1m new passengers (up to 500,000 visitors) will deliver 
more visitors than The Gathering in 2013 and will lead to the creation of at least 1,000 new jobs at these Irish 
airports where research by the Airport Council International (ACI) demonstrates that 1,000 new jobs are created at 
international airports for every 1m additional passengers delivered.
Ryanair expects that this traffic growth will be focused on a range of new routes and additional frequencies on 
existing routes, although the list of routes and frequencies and the share of traffic growth will be finalised in talks 
with the Irish airports over the coming days. 
In Dublin, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
'Ryanair warmly welcomes the Government's decision to repeal the €3 travel tax. This travel tax (originally €10) in 
2009 caused Irish air travel and tourism to suffer precipitous losses in recent years. The repeal of the air travel tax 
helps restore Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness to overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe 
in particular. 
In response to yesterday's budget, Ryanair will engage over the next 2 days with all of our Irish airport partners to 
see how and where we can add new routes or additional frequencies on existing routes, and deliver at least 1m 
new passengers p.a. at these Irish airports from April 2014, which will create over 1,000 new jobs as a direct result 
of the Government's decision to scrap the visitor tax.
Ryanair Will Grow Traffic At Irish Airports By Over 1m Passengers P.A. From April 2014
Subject to final negotiation on new routes and additional frequencies on existing routes with the individual airports, 
we hope to be in a position to announce details of new route and traffic growth plans at the Irish airports over the 
coming weeks.'

 Tiger Management's Julian Robertson was on CNBC last week and we wanted to highlight some of his comments 
from the transcript. Stocks Robertson mentioned in the interview that he likes include Ulta Salon (ULTA), Delta 
Airlines (DAL), WuXi Pharma (WX), DigitalGlobe (DGI) and Norwegian company Schibsted,
 On the economic landscape: "Well, I would-- characterize it as precarious. And-- I think everyone knows that. And-- 
I think that-- rather than just sitting back and-- saying, "What if this happens or that happens"-- we go ahead and 
find good companies and invest in them and-- bad companies and-- them."
 On Ulta Salon (ULTA): "But I do see sweet stocks that I really love and like and-- think are going to do well. And-- 
one is-- a company that-- probably makes that beautiful toenail polish you've got on. A company called Ulta. And it 
has just beautiful beauty salons all over the country. And it sells all the great products. And it's growing-- probably at 
25%-- or so, will grow that way over the next three or four years. This year won't be quite that good. But-- it is just 
amazing what's happened. And-- how well they've caught this great movement. And-- we've interviewed a lot of 
women and Ulta is where they're going."
 On what he looks for when picking stocks: "Well, I-- one of the things that I'm particularly interested in is-- stocks 
and who's already picked them. And-- we've had some really good people here who have excelled in certain fields 
and-- I love to see really what they had bought recently. And-- Ulta is one of those stocks. And-- I think it's going to 
be a real good one for next year, so."
 On the market: "That's really the way I'm looking at stocks primarily now. I think we're in the middle of a kind of a 
bubble market, where it's going to take something-- bubble-like to happen. And-- prick the bubble and we'll probably 
have pretty bad-- reactions to the breaking of the bubble. But-- probably not right now. And somehow I think we'll 
wallow through the political and fiscal crisis we have in front of us. And then we'll sort of see what happens ... I think 
the market is reasonably -- yes, is fully valued."
 On DigitalGlobe (DGI): "Digital Globe is I think a really great company. And it's had its virtual monopoly in the area 
where it is. And-- I think they're really these satellites that are up flying around are-- it's a great business to be in."
 On WuXi Pharma (WX): "This year one of our best stocks has been-- a Chinese company which-- 
disintermediates-- PhDs. In other words, instead of getting a U.S. PhD for maybe-- $20,000 a month, you get a 
Chinese PhD for-- $3,000 a month. And-- it's a company that's named Wuxi that supplies the really good Chinese 
researchers. And-- I've been in that stock for several years and it's just been lately that it's started to do anything. 
And I don't know why that is or was or anything. But it's been a really good performer of late-- Wuxi. you're buying-- 
Julian Robertson Calls Environment 'Precarious,' Likes Ulta Salon, Delta Others
something at a fifth the price you were paying before. And-- you figure that's going to work at some time. And these 
Chinese PhDs are really well-trained and very, very good and-- Wuxi is able to come up with good ones."
 On Twitter's IPO: "I don't plan to be (a buyer of the IPO). That isn't to say that I won't. But I don't expect to at this 
point. I think social media is very long-lasting. I just don't know the particular thing with Twitter."
 On the airlines: "Well, we're beginning to put some money in the airlines. And-- I mean, Delta airline, the airlines 
have been weeded down. And-- Delta Airlines (DAL) a very good story. I mean, it's at a very reasonable price and 
it's a good airline. I've talked to you about Ryanair (RYAAY), which is a low-cost producer in the world. I think that-- 
area is something to look at. And there-- they-- there have been-- I think some really interesting moves made in that 
industry. Seems so much (consolidation) that I think it will slow down from here."
 On Europe:"I think a lot of smart Europeans think that Europe has bottomed. And I-- I've been hearing that 
increasingly. And-- I-- I'm not completely sure of that. But-- it's certainly better than it was."
 On Schibsted: "Schibsted is a very interesting company. We came upon-- Schibsted-- it was-- we had-- a model we 
were setting up on-- newspaper stocks. And Schibsted had come out as being wildly overpriced. And then we went 
into it in thorough detail and-- although it's true that-- Schibsted had still had its papers, it had gone tremendously 
into internet products. And-- it is really an internet-- producer-- media producer of internet products-- throughout the 
world now and-- is going to grow at very rapid rates for the next several years. And-- so I think Schibsted is quite a 
terrific-- Norwegian company."
 On his success: "(What) I've done is-- hired really good people and never been self-conscious of hiring people that 
were smarter than I am. And-- it's been fun for me to work with them and-- to play with them in all that we've had 
together. And-- so that's the secret sauce."
 On being long or short this market: "Well, I think you have to have kind of-- a little more--sort of lean towards-- 
being conservative in a market like this. It's just-- gotten a little too -- I would say raising cash or going short."

 €100,000 CALENDAR PROCEEDS WILL HELP TEENAGE CANCER PATIENTS
Ryanair, Europe's low fares airline, today (14 Oct) announced that its cabin crew have selected Teenage Cancer 
Trust as their charity partner for the 2014 Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar, which it hopes will raise €100,000 
for the Teenage Cancer Trust, bringing the total raised by Ryanair's cabin crew for charity to over €700,000 since 
the first calendar in 2008. 
 Teenage Cancer Trust is the only UK charity dedicated to improving the quality of life and survival chances for 
young people with cancer aged between 13 and 24. The charity funds and builds specialist units in NHS hospitals 
and provides dedicated staff, bringing young people together to be treated by teenage cancer experts.
 Teenage Cancer Trust also educates young people about cancer to help improve the speed and quality of 
diagnosis. During the summer months, special sun safety sessions are delivered to highlight the dangers of skin 
cancer and Ryanair will be supporting the charity's Shunburn campaign.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 'Ryanair's fabulous cabin crew have selected Teenage Cancer Trust as the lucky charity that will receive all of the 
€100,000 proceeds from the 2014 Ryanair Cabin Crew Charity Calendar sales, which will help support their 27 
specialist cancer units for young people across the UK. Every year 10,000 copies of the Ryanair cabin crew charity 
calendar sell out in record time, so everyone who wants to help Teenage Cancer Trust with its work can buy 
Ryanair's 2014 calendar onboard, on our website, or from Teenage Cancer Trust's website when it goes on sale 
shortly.'
 Teenage Cancer Trust's Interim Director of Fundraising, Kate Collins said:
'It's fantastic news that Ryanair cabin crew have chosen to support Teenage Cancer Trust through the sales of the 
2014 calendar. Around seven young people aged between 13 and 24 are diagnosed with cancer every day in the 
UK and the money raised by Ryanair staff and customers from calendar sales will help us to continue to provide 
them with the vital specialist support they need.'
 Teenage Cancer Trust is a registered charity: 1062559 (England Wales); SC039757 (Scotland)

Oct 09, 2013 (The Bangkok Post:http://feeds.feedblitz.com/prorssbp Delivered by Newstex)
 My father was Irish, and I've always had a soft spot for the Emerald Isle. Before each visit, there's a part of me that 
imagines the way it was last time _ friendly, sociable, engaging, fun and often fluid, from both the rain and the Black 
Stuff _ cannot be repeated. But it always is. After two days on our last visit to Cork and Connemara, my 12-year-old 
son asked why the Irish are so much friendlier than the English. And that visit was made as Ireland was plunging 
deeper into the economic mire. Maybe it is because the Irish are so used to crises that the attitude of many in the 
face of the slump is 'What's new?'
 It's this effortless Irish geniality that leaves me befuddled by Ryanair. It's Europe's largest regional airline, and it's 
Irish.
 The first surprise is perhaps that such a huge airline began in Waterford in southeastern Ireland _ hardly an 
aviation nerve centre, although well known for the production of fine crystalware.
 The second surprise is Ireland's most recent commercial success story does not reflect seemingly typical Irish 
traits _ in fact, quite the opposite. Chief executive Michael O'Leary has been variously described as arrogant, 
contradictory and abrasive. Sit back and wallow in the words of this sensitive Irish poet. On passengers who forget 
to print their boarding pass: 'We think they should pay 60 euros (2,600 baht) for being so stupid.' On refunds: 
'You're not getting a refund, so **** off. We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 'No refund' don't you 
understand?' On environmentalists: 'We want to annoy the whenever we can. The best thing you can do with 
environmentalists is shoot them.' And believe me, these are some of the milder of the man's quoted rantings.
 And the third surprise is that such an obviously unfriendly brand should be so commercially successful. Perhaps 
this suggests that my own thinking on the creation of a unique service attitude as a prerequisite for service brand 
success is misplaced. It flies to lots of places. It's cheap. Who cares whether it has a likeable and distinctive culture! 
Maybe those of us in the hospitality industry are missing something.
 Normally, brands that behave this way get away with it because there's a lack of competition, but in Ryanair's case 
it's been vying for customers' euros alongside EasyJet, Air Berlin, Vueling and many others. One of the more 
obvious reasons for its success is that as a pioneer, it achieved a certain scale during the early and less-
competitive days of budget air travel, and it's now passing the economies of that scale on to customers. Fair 
enough, but Ryanair was recently voted Europe's worst short-haul airline by readers of Britain's Which? magazine. 
There's even a website dedicated to those who hate the airline. Do the cost savings achieved compensate for poor 
customer service standards? I guess the answer must be 'yes', yet I sense there is a growing 'but'.
 Europe has been fighting its way through what some describe as the worst financial crisis in its history. Savings 
mattered, and Ryanair represented the best savings. But as of April, the euro zone officially moved out of recession 
 Irish skies aren't smiling (But may soon)
_ things have begun to pick up. But not, it seems, for Ryanair, as Mr O'Leary recently announced the airline will 
likely fall short of its 2014 outlook, in part, and in its own words, because of the continuation of the poor shape of 
the economy and increased competition. Its share price dropped by 15% on the news.
 Yet at the same time, its biggest rival, EasyJet, has revised up its forecasts as it makes inroads into the corporate 
travel market, continues to upgrade its online presence, introduces seat allocations for the first time and nudges 
ahead of Ryanair in terms of punctuality. It's also embracing a refined position that reflects _ in a nutshell _ 
'warmth'. It may sound fuzzy but appears to be working. And it's certainly something Ryanair has little of.
 However, Mr O'Leary recognises his airline must start being more customer-friendly. 'We should try to eliminate 
things that unnecessarily piss people off,' he said recently in Dublin.
 So why now? Maybe it's in part because with a little more disposable income, Europeans are now prepared to pay 
more for a softer edge to their service and seek other value-adds rather than discounts. Another reason could be 
customers were prepared to put up with a brand that was brash and anti-establishment when it was small.
 But now in some respects it is the establishment, and many folks don't take too kindly to what they see as a 
combination of big and arrogant. An irreverent feistiness works well when you're David, which consumers associate 
with the 'underdog' tag. When you're Goliath, it's harder to swallow.
 When the budget airline space took off, many were so delighted they could afford to fly that the quality of the offer 
was secondary. There were also very few brand options, so consumers worried less about brand differentiation. 
The economic recession then extended the period of forgiveness for service that was less than caring.
 Ryanair benefited. But now, with competitors improving and growing again in number, the recession slowly 
receding and customers perhaps tiring of the Irishman's tirades, it will be interesting to see how Ryanair evolves its 
brand from a 'challenger' to a 'challenged' position.
 One thing is for sure _ to sustain its remarkable success, it must blossom into a brand that embraces positive and 
distinctive values rather than relying so much on price, product (which can be copied) and pushiness (which people 
don't take to so well). This is true for all service industry pioneers _ your tangible advantages will take you so far, 
but over the long term and at your core you must be a brand that customers genuinely like. It's no different to 
human relationships. The sustainable ones are not simply based on adding up the rational benefits.
 Maybe Mr O should inject a little more of what his compatriots are best known for. In 2011, the UN found that in 
answer to the question 'Are you happy?' Ireland came top of the list of 156 countries. Now here's a thought _ 
'Ryanair: The Happy Airline'. The mind boggles.

 France has been hit by another strike by air traffic controllers protesting a European Union plan to centralize the 
continent's airspace. Airlines have been advised to cancel a tenth of the day's flights. Thursday's strike by French 
air traffic controllers had been called by two smaller unions in protest of an EU initiative to centralize control of 
European airspace. The work stoppage forced several airlines to cancel scores of short-haul flights.
 Carriers had been asked to cancel 10 percent of the day's flights within France and to Spain, Portugal and North 
Africa.
 Low-cost carrier Ryanair was reported to have cancelled close to 90 flights right away, with Germany's flagship 
airline, Lufthansa, also partly affected by the strike action which was limited as the biggest union, USAC-CGT did 
not join in.
 Clash of opinions
 Thursday's strike was the second since June by air traffic controllers protesting the EU's so-called "Single Sky" 
initiative.
 Brussels said centralizing the continent's airspace would reduce congestion and inefficiencies costing airlines and 
passengers an estimated five billion euros ($6.6 billion) annually.
 But many employees feared the planned reform could easily lead to more difficult working conditions and job cuts.

 Flying is associated with travels and adventures[1] in new far-off places. Millions fly for business and leisure across 
continents on a daily basis, and with a huge number of airlines to choose from, branding[2] is dramatically 
important. And the airline logo is at the heart of it. Organizations need attractive and catchy logo designs[3] 
particularly in an industry as competitive as the airline industry. The most successful logos are those which can be 
easily reproduced on paper[4] from memory. Here I've collected 20 beautiful airline logo designs for your 
inspiration. In most of the logos below you'll see that they were not designed to depict aircrafts but to show flying.

 UKIP politician Godfrey Bloom has put his foot in his mouth again causing shock waves across the nation. Not 
content with having offended the entire continent of Africa with his comments about bongo bongo land he has now 
pronounced that party activists are sluts who don't clean behind their fringes. Whilst women everywhere wallow in 
their righteous indignation, I find that I rather like this guy. I am not saying that I agree with his sentiments rather 
that I am relieved to hear a public figure speak with a total disregard for political correctness which I view as 21st 
century Fascism.
Liberty
In the supposedly free world we are not at liberty at all when it comes to voicing an opinion. Every public figure must 
spend their days tied up in knots and wading through treacle trying to find a way put a point across without mortally 
offending someone. Everyone is so sensitive to any form of prejudicial attitude that they are perceived where none 
exists. Politicians must create and follow through policies by defining them as anything other than what they actually 
are and the concept of the joke will soon be extinct because a joke is always at someone's expense. Football 
managers can't even criticize a referee without being slapped with a fine and accused of bringing the game into 
disrepute.
The Truth
In this world of political correctness the last thing anyone should utter is the truth. Anyone who does is instantly 
vilified, there is a public outcry and they are branded as evil. The stupid thing is that we mostly know the truth but 
society is just in a place where it is unacceptable to speak it. I have had enough of this nonsense. I don't agree with 
much of what Godfrey Bloom says but I cherish his right to say it. At least I know what he really thinks.
Ryanair
Public vilification has never been more evident than in the case of Michael O'Leary the rather forthright chief of 
Ryanair. Never mind that his airline helped to bring about a revolution in air travel that has made it affordable for all. 
Never mind that he has built a successful company that is still expanding or that his planes don't tend to drop out of 
the sky. He puts people's noses out of joint so the media wage war on Ryanair looking for any reason to discredit 
them. His pronouncements[1] that fat people are inconvenient to sit next to and that customers are not always right 
have scandalised many who seem to have overlooked the truth of his statements! I frankly don't care if I get 
charged to put my fishing tackle[2] in the hold or meet with trouble if I turn up late at the airport. What is so sinful 
about that? Even with a mountain of sporting equipment, my suitcase and the admin charges Ryanair are still better 
value than many other airlines and that is the truth!
We Won't Change The World With Political Correctness
We Should Listen
I really believe that if people spoke the truth just a little more often we could solve a lot of our problems. Bad things 
never change because we are all too busy trying to say they are OK and issuing platitudes. The truth is that some 
airline passengers do behave appallingly and so the customer is not always right, football referees screw up all the 
time, Belgium is a country which is notable for very little and some busy women don't clean behind their fridges. We 
should not punish the outspoken we should listen to them because they just might be right.

Oct 04, 2013 (The Financial Services Club Blog:http://www.thefinanser.com Delivered by Newstex)
 I just had one of those really frustrating experiences with an airline.
 It's a cheap airline that charges for an extra €10 for a large cabin bag (over 42 x 32 x 25cm) to be taken on board, 
as well as a fee per checked bag. 
 So I pay to put a bag in the hold during my online booking and turn up at the airport with two cases - a briefcase 
and a suitcase - whilst my colleague has a heavy cabin bag and a suitcase.
 At the airport, they check sizes of all cabin bags and it turns out my briefcase is 1 centimetre too wide. It's very light 
and thin, but that 1 centimetre turns into a €40 fine for not pre-booking a large cabin bag for a €10 fee. Meanwhile, 
my colleague's bag which is twice as wide and heavy, but within limits, is no charge. To be honest, it was clear that 
this is just a method of catching out the customer in order to raise extra income from nefarious fees and means, and 
it left me livid.
 Fuming from the moment of before check-in at the airport, I spent the whole flight cursing and hating the airline 
every minute of the way.
 It wasn't the fine that bugged me, but the we'll catch you if we can way in which it is used.
 So, in order to avoid a fee on the flight back, I went online and changed my booking to include one large cabin bag, 
for a fee of €10.
 Arriving at the airport, the experience was very different and, as I queued at the Gate, the airline staff came round 
and, without checking my ticket or asking, stamped a 'small cabin bag' sticker on my large cabin bag briefcase.
 They didn't measure it or question it, just waived it through.
 Now I was livid for paying the €10 fee before boarding when I needn't have.
 What this demonstrates, if you put yourself in my shoes, is how really annoying stupid rules are, particularly if they 
are applied inconsistently.
 I now intensely dislike this airline because, if I ever travel with them again, I will need to carry a tape measure with 
me to see if I'm going to make or break their rules.
 Now think of this in a bank.
 In a bank, there are many stupid rules but one of the most irritating is the practice of clearing all debits from an 
account before applying any credits.
Does good customer service matter? Not really ...
 This is a common practice and tries to push the accountholder into overdraft, so fees apply, before applying any 
credit offsets to the account to avoid such overdrawn issues.
 This is why some people are happy to pay more for flexible accounts that do not apply stupid rules or fees.
 So you then say: what you pay for is what you get.
 Maybe.
 But then take note of a certain airline leader's humiliation and change of view recently:[1]*
 Earlier this month Ryanair decided that being horrid to customers was not a great business strategy and declared it 
would be a bit nicer. This was pretty remarkable and has, indeed, been much remarked upon.
 Yet even more remarkable was what caused chief executive Michael O'Leary to make this U-turn. It was not 
market research. It was not social networks. It certainly was not anything to do with management consultants, 
whom Mr O'Leary once said he would shoot if they ever darkened his doorstep. Nor was it due to pressure from the 
board.
 Instead, the trigger was people who periodically accost him in McDonald's to moan about his airline while he sits 
trying to enjoy a meal with his kids. As he said to shareholders at last week's annual meeting, he is sick and tired of 
it.
 So never mind big data. When it comes to bringing about change it is criticism delivered in person by random 
strangers that counts. 
 Customers do count, even if we don't think their opinions matter.
 Take it another way, here's a view from Manu Sporny, who blogged about his SIBOS experience[2] this year:
 Many people are under the false impression that the most valuable customer a bank can have is the one that walks 
into one of their branches and opens an account. This impression was shattered when I heard the head of an 
international bank utter the following with respect to banking branches: '80% of our customers add nothing but sand 
to our bottom line.' The banker was alluding to the perception that the most significant thing that customers bring 
into the banking branch is the sand on the bottom of their shoes … most of a bank's revenue comes from activities 
like short-term lending, utilizing leverage against deposits, float-based leveraging, high-frequency trading, 
derivatives trading, and other financial exercises that are far removed with what most people in the world think of 
when they think of the type of activities one does at a bank.
 So do customers count? Should we care about their feelings?
 Even a 'millionaire' cannot expect good service at the bank[3]
 Banks for the rich are not always better than banks for the rest of us, according to a mystery shopping exercise that 
revealed shortcomings at some of the most illustrious private banks. 
 UBS, the biggest private bank in the world, was portrayed as impersonal, indifferent and offering a distinctly off-the-
peg service, in spite of its promise of being bespoke. 
 Coutts, which serves the Queen as well as dozens of professional footballers, was criticised for its lack of empathy 
and could not even jot down cusotmes email details correctly.
 Rothschild Bank failed to call prospective clients back after promising to do so, while Mirabaud made a gaffe about 
their nationality.
 * take note that Ryanair are speaking at the Financial Services Club Ireland on 16th October
 Ryanair, Europe's Leading Airline[4] with Howard Millar, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, 
Ryanair
 Ryanair has grown from small beginnings to rank as one of the leading airlines of the World and is a huge financial 
success story.
 Publicly associated with its flamboyant Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, we have asked his deputy Howard Millar, 
Chief Financial Officer to talk to us. He is intimately associated with the success of the business and his 
presentation will share the current state of the airline and provide insights to the factors that make Ryanair such a 
force in the highly competitive international airline business.
 With a current fleet of over 300 aircraft and 80 million passengers a year the aim is to grow that to over 400 aircraft 
and 110 million passengers by 2019. The financial highlights include a reported net profit to March 2013 of €569 
million on revenues of €4.8 billion, not to mention a balance sheet carrying €3.5 billion of cash!
 This is a success story worth hearing.
 The session will be followed by drinks, canapés and networking.

Lufthansa to fly into profitable zone with European business

 Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa has said it's making big strides in its restructuring efforts and endeavors to 
save costs. It expected its European flights business to become profitable again this year. Lufthansa executives 
said Germany's airline was on track to meet ambitious savings targets as defined under its "Score" program, which 
foresaw raising the company's operating profit to 2.3 billion euros ($3.13 billion) by 2015.
 Executives said during an investors' conference in London on Friday that Lufthansa's low-budget subsidiary 
Germanwings had been making a huge contribution to achieve those targets.
 Since July 1 of this year, Lufthansa's domestic and European flights have been taken over by Germanwings, with 
the exception of flights using the Frankfurt and Munich hubs. Management said the move was expected to improve 
2013 profits in this segment by 90 million euros after five straight years of incurring losses.
 Rising to the challenge
 Germanwings chief Thomas Winkelmann said the low-budget carrier's passenger jets would most likely log a 2.9-
percent increase in utilization throughout 2013, with average earnings per passenger expected to surge by 4.5 
percent.
 Lufthansa Passage chief Carsten Spohr pointed to the advantage of reducing the number of jet types in the 
airline's fleet to 8, down from 15 originally. But he added that more than half a billion euros would have to be 
invested by 2015 in redesigning the business class for long-haul flights.
 Lufthansa's "Score" restructuring program was conceived in response to more competition from low-budget airlines 
such as Ireland's Ryanair and the emergence of new carriers, including Emirates.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline (ULCC), today (3 Oct) 
made a €10,000 donation to the UK charity Naomi House and Jacksplace, the latest in a long line of charities to 
receive support from Ryanair's 'Fly to Win' onboard scratchcards.
Ryanair's Director of Customer Service, Caroline Green, and crew members, Federico Galli, Isotta Maffei, Gaia 
Cafolla and Brian Gibson, were on hand to present the €10,000 donation to Mark Smith, deputy CEO of Naomi 
House, which provides valuable care and support to children and young people with life-limiting and life-threatening

the Jack Jill Foundation, The Marie Keating Foundation, the GROW Organisation and the Men's Sheds Association 
in Ireland, The Meyer Children's Hospital and L'Aquila Playgrounds in Italy, Fundación Pequeño Deseo in Spain 
and now Naomi House and Jacksplace in the UK.
 Ryanair's Caroline Green said:
'Ryanair is delighted to support Naomi House and Jacksplace, which does so much to help children and young 
children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions. The hospice is one of many charities across Europe to 
receive ongoing donations from our 'Fly To Win' scratchcards, where passengers not only have the chance to win 
some fantastic prizes by playing, but can also help out many great causes.'
Naomi House and Jacksplace Deputy Chief Executicve, Mark Smith said:
'We are delighted to receive this generous donation from Ryanair's fabulous charity scratchcards. This donation 
enables us to continue providing valuable care and support to children and young people. With less than 20% of the 
£7 million we seek to raise annually coming from Government, we are reliant on donations such as this to continue 
our work.'

Ryanair To Appeal French Court Ruling Fines

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1]
 Ryanair today (2 Oct) confirmed that it will appeal this afternoon's ruling by the Aix En Provence Court which 
imposed fines and damages totalling €8m, the majority of which relate to alleged non-payment of social insurance 
and state pension contributions in France for Ryanair crews flying to/from Marseille from 2007 to 2010, despite the 
fact that these people were employed on Irish contracts, operating on Irish registered aircraft (defined as Irish 
territory) and have already paid their taxes, social taxes and state pension contributions in Ireland, in full 
compliance with Irish and EU regulations.
Ryanair believes there is a clear contradiction between current EU employment regulations under which these Irish 
workers paid their taxes and social taxes in Ireland, and the 2006 French decree, which seeks to require airline 
crews operating in Ireland to pay social taxes and pension contributions in France, despite the fact that they have 
already paid them in Ireland.
Ryanair believes this contradiction can ultimately only be resolved by the European Courts upholding EU 
regulations on the employment of mobile transport workers, and Ryanair intends to pursue this appeal all the way to 
the European Courts. Should Ryanair be ultimately forced to pay these social taxes and pension contributions in 
France, then the vast majority of these contributions will be reclaimable from the Irish Government.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Ryanair will study today's ruling in detail, and will be lodging an early appeal. Since all of our people operating 
to/from Marseille between 2007 and 2010 have already paid their social taxes and pension contributions in Ireland, 
in full compliance with Irish and EU employment regulations, we do not believe that either Ryanair or our people 
can be forced to double pay these contributions a second time in France. 
In the meantime, Ryanair and its people will continue to comply fully with Irish and EU employment law, income 
taxes and social tax obligations.'

 A regional French court has ordered Irish carrier Ryanair to pay millions of euros for breaching labor laws on the 
ground. The airline also stood accused of barring workers' access to unions. The court in southern France ruled 
Ryanair would have to pay nearly 10 million euros ($13.5 million) in damages and interest after being found guilty of 
neglecting labor regulations in the eurozone's second-biggest economy.
 It also fined the company an extra 200,000 euros for illegally giving Marseille-based staff Irish contracts in order to 
save on payroll and taxes. Ryanair had said before the verdict that it would appeal any sanctions.
 But if upheld, the damages would need to be paid to France's social security system, the state pension fund and 
unions all of which appeared as plaintiffs in the legal action against the low-budget carrier.
 Matter of interpretation
 Ryanair had argued that it did not have a permanent base in the Marseille area and that there was therefore noting 
wrong in keeping its workforce on Irish job contracts. But prosecutors said that claim was not really credible as the 
airline had established offices at the airport and its staff were living locally.
 Experts noted the fines would certainly be a blow to Ryanair, but one the company could afford in the face of 569 
million euros in profits logged during the last fiscal year.
 Ryanair could have faced even heavier penalties in line with a prosecution request, but the judge rejected a fine 
equivalent to the value of the four Boeing 737s the airline had flown out of Marseille between 2007 and 2011.

enjoyed a record 12-months with over 80m passengers choosing one of our ultra-low fares. We also carried over 
9m in August - the first European airline to ever do so.

 I need to book a single flight from Brussels to Madrid in the evening of 27th November. And yes, before you shout 
at me, I have to leave after 1800 on 27th in Brussels, and arrive before 0800 on 28th in Madrid, so trains are not 
possible. I need only a single ticket to Madrid, as after the event there I will be departing elsewhere.
 Brussels Airlines is the only airline with flights from Zaventem in the evening of 27th. If I ask for a single, this is 
what I get - €307.
If I add a return trip, on some date a while into the future, I get these prices:
Even if I add on the price of a cheap return (about €50), I still end up with a total - €170 - that's considerably lower 
than the price for a single. The single ticket is for economy+ - basically a crappy snack, and the same small, poky 
seat.
 So what am I doing instead? Flying with Ryanair from Charleroi. Standard price: €20.39, admittedly excluding fees. 
I can even then afford to take a taxi to my destination upon arrival. If I wanted a return I would simply add the price 
of the return.
 Your defence, Brussels Airlines?

CASE REGARDING MARSEILLE BASE FROM 2006 TO 2010 
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low fare carrier, today (1 Oct) confirmed, in response to media queries, that it expects 
a negative ruling and a fine in the Aix-en-Provence Court tomorrow (2 Oct). This ruling will be based, in particular, 
on the French Decree which was introduced in Nov 2006, after Ryanair's operational base in Marseille had opened. 
Already under this decree, rulings against Easyjet (Apr 2010) and Cityjet (Mar 2012) have been made under which 
those airlines incurred fines, penalties and back-charges of approx €1.6m and €1m respectively.
The 2006 French Decree was specifically introduced as further state protection for the loss making Air France, and 
to limit competition to high fare Air France from lower cost airlines, including Ryanair, Easyjet and Cityjet, on French 
domestic routes.
Since the crew operating Ryanair's flights to and from Marseille worked for an airline with its registered office in 
Ireland and spent their working day on Irish registered aircraft, they are considered to be working principally in 
Ireland and not in France. Ryanair crews were correctly working under Irish contracts of employment and paying 
Irish social insurance in accordance with the applicable European employment and social security laws. Ryanair 
does not believe that the 2006 Decree applied to its operations in Marseille but following decisions against other 
airlines such as Easyjet and Cityjet, it expects a negative ruling at this first stage of these proceedings in France. 
Ryanair confirms that it will appeal any such negative ruling and any attempt by the French authorities to seek 
payment of social insurance payments which have already been paid in full in Ireland. 
Ryanair highlighted that once these proceedings were launched in the French courts, it immediately closed its year-
round operational base in Marseille. This case therefore covers the period 2006 to 2010 only and not the summer 
only operation carried out at Marseille since April 2011 which have a different base structure.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Since Easyjet and Cityjet have already suffered negative rulings under this French Decree, we have reasons to 
believe that Ryanair's year-round base in Marseille, which closed in January 2011, will also suffer a negative ruling. 
We will appeal any such negative ruling (and fine) on the basis that European employment and social security law 
clearly allows mobile workers on Irish registered aircraft, working for an Irish airline, to pay their taxes and social 
taxes in Ireland.'

 Who knew that the hotel minibar would serve as such an inspiration to an entire industry? Saddled with rising fuel 
costs and the demands of recession-weary consumers that fares not skyrocket, airlines have taken to add-on 
charges in a big way.
 And it's not just fees for baggage checks anymore. Inspired by the captive audience-meets-a la carte concept of 
the hotel minibar, airlines of every stripe are finding new and creative revenue streams. Last year, 53 of the world's 
airlines reported a whopping $27.1 billion in ancillary revenues, according to a new report by the consulting firm 
IdeaWorks Co. That's a significant rise from the $2.45 billion in add-on revenues that 23 airlines reported in 2008, 
back when sales from ancillary items were relatively new.
 "I think the ancillary revenue movement - or shall I say a la carte fees - goes beyond mere revenue," says Jay 
Sorensen, CEO of IdeaWorks. "It offers the potential for an airline to better tailor service to the needs of individual 
customers. They can click and buy the amenities they want rather than the airline deciding what is bundled in the 
base fare."
 For years, discount carriers like Ireland's RyanAir (NASDAQ:RYAAY[1]) and the United Kingdom's EasyJet 
(OTCMKTS:EJTTF) have relied on ancillary fees for a large portion of their overall revenues. Last year alone, 
RyanAir racked up nearly $1.4 billion in add-on revenues, some 22% of its annual revenues that account for more 
than $17 per passenger. This year, the title of Grand Poobah of Ancillary Revenue goes to Spirit Airlines 
(NASDAQ:SAVE[2]), whose half-billion dollars in add-on sales accounted for more than 38% of its annual revenues. 
Spirit got each passenger to fork over nearly $49 in extra fees last year.
 Baggage-check fees marked the beginning of the add-on trend. But passengers quickly responded to those fees by 
refusing to check their bags. In turn, airlines tweaked the add-on business model to make customers perceive many 
of the new fees as adding value to their trips, says Sorensen. IdeaWorks estimates that "economy comfort" seating, 
for example, contributed some $88 million to AirFrance/KLM's (OTCMKTS:AFLYY[3]) transcontinental routes in 
2012.
 What surprised Sorensen most in this year's revenue survey is the extent to which full-service airlines in America 
and even Europe have embraced the a la carte trend. "Air France/KLM is rapidly going down this path and offers 
many optional extras, such as fees for better seats, premium meals, and holding - but not buying - a reservation," 
he says.
 According to IdeaWorks, America's largest airlines like United (NYSE:UAL[4]) and Delta (NYSE:DAL[5]) generated 
most of their ancillary revenues (more than $6 billion worth) by selling frequent flier miles, especially in conjunction 
with credit card companies. Baggage fees still account for 20% of their add-on sales. European carriers are 
With a Fee for Everything, Airlines Jet Toward a New Business Model
following suit. In the case of Norwegian Airlines, the company owns a portion of Bank Norwegian, which paid the 
airline commissions of $6.9 million from Visa (NYSE:V[6]) card fees last year.
 The major US and European carriers are offering an ever-growing list of products like food, drinks, Internet access, 
and commissions from hotel bookings. Plus, they're monetizing things like priority security screenings, exit row 
seats, early boarding, and even one-time access to booze-filled airport lounges. The "EarlyBird" boarding program 
made Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV[7]) more than $160 million last year.
 The cost of jet fuel rose by more than $0.25 per gallon this summer, prompting many non-discount airlines to join 
the race for add-on fees. Some high-end carriers, like the UAE's Emirates and Germany's Lufthansa 
(OTCMKTS:DLAKY[8]), however, continue to make less than 1% of their annual revenues from ancillary fees.

ALL FLIGHTS RETURN TO WARSAW MODLIN AIRPORT ON MON 30TH SEPT
Ryanair, Poland's No 1 airline, today (26 Sept 13) confirmed that it had seen a surge in bookings on its 30 routes 
to/from the Polish capital since it announced that its flights were switching from Chopin back to Warsaw Modlin 
Airport on Mon 30th Sept next. 
To celebrate its return to Warsaw Modlin (just 38kms from the Palace of Culture), Ryanair today announced its first 
two Polish domestic routes from March 2014, with daily flights from Warsaw Modlin to Gdansk and Wroclaw. Traffic 
on these 2 routes is being held back by LOT's high fare monopoly. LOT's lowest fare on the Gdansk route is 167zl 
(€40), and on the Wroclaw route its 178zl (€42). Ryanair's flights from Warsaw to Gdansk and Wroclaw will go on 
sale on 1 Nov next at fares which are nearly half of LOT's lowest fares, thereby saving Polish passengers millions 
of PLN's annually. 
Ryanair will operate these 2 domestic routes to Gdansk and Wroclaw with its new Boeing 737 aircraft, which will 
provide more seats, better prices, better punctuality and better customer service than high-fare LOT.
In Warsaw Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'We have been pleased with the surge in bookings since we announced the return of Ryanair's flights to Warsaw 
Modlin on Monday 30th Sept in just 5 day's time. In 2014 Ryanair will operate more than 30 routes to/from Warsaw 
Modlin and we expect our traffic to grow to 1.5m passengers to/from Modlin in 2014.
We have no doubt that Warsaw Modlin's location (just 38kms from the centre of Warsaw) allied to its low cost base, 
cheap car parking and easy bus transfers, will make it the airport of choice for passengers flying on Ryanair's first 
two Polish domestic routes from Gdansk and Wroclaw to Warsaw.
In the last two years Ryanair has grown to be Poland's No. 1 airline carrying more passengers than LOT. These 
first two domestic routes will deliver significantly lower air fares for Polish consumers, and finally free them from 
LOT's high fares on domestic routes.'

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] LOWEST FARES, ON-TIME FLIGHTS BEST SERVICES - RYANAIR 
IS THE BUSINESS
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (25 Sep) launched a new acceptance agreement with 
American Express, providing passengers, business travellers and corporate travel departments with even more 
ways to book the lowest fares on the Ryanair.com website.
 More than 20% of Ryanair passengers travel on business and Ryanair has improved its services to meet the needs 
of its business passengers by offering: The lowest fares and no fuel surcharges, saving companies millions in travel 
expensesOnline check-in, avoiding airport queues and saving timePriority boarding, ensuring passengers can 
board and exit the aircraft firstReserved seating on one of 45 seats, at the front, rear and over the wings for greater 
legroomEurope's best punctuality (94% of flights were on-time in August) and fewest cancellationsA free 10kg cabin 
bag (and the fewest mishandled bags in Europe)Free downloads of the Ryanair app (previously €3) from 1 October 
for bookings on the goThe removal of the Recaptcha security feature for individual passengers from 30 OctoberThe 
roll out of a digital marketing strategy to enhance business travel experience10. A range of credit and debit card 
booking options, now including American Express, used by many individuals, business travellers and corporate 
travel departments to book their flights. In London, Ryanair's Howard Millar said:
'Ryanair offers the lowest airfares with no fuel surcharges guaranteed, and the best customer service, with the most 
on-time flights, the fewest cancellations and the least lost bags, which is why we will carry 81m passengers this 
year - more international passengers than any other airline in the world. Now even more passengers including 
business travellers, travel agents and corporate travel departments, can book the lowest fares on the Ryanair.com 
website by using an American Express card.
We estimate that 20% to 25% of our passengers are travelling on business, with online check-in ensuring they 
avoid airport queues, while the option of priority boarding and reserved seating has proven extremely popular not 
only with business passengers, who can board and exit the aircraft first, or choose one of 45 pre-reserved seats, 
but also with families and those travelling in groups. Indeed, a recent survey of Ryanair passengers in Spain, where 
Ryanair is the largest carrier, highlighted that 22% of our passengers were travelling on business. 
Ryanair Announces New American Express Acceptance Agreement
It's a similar trend across Europe; for example we currently operate approximately 32 daily flights between Dublin 
and London, the busiest international route in Europe and with more than 20% of business passengers on these 
flights, we expect that percentage to grow as we roll out a range of business-tailored services, including the option 
now of booking Ryanair flights with American Express. When it comes to the lowest fares, the most on-time flights 
and the best range of services, Ryanair is the business.'
American Express' Senior VP GM, Merchant Services Europe, Werner Decker, said:
'Many of our Cardmembers are regular travellers - whether for leisure or business - and I am pleased that they now 
have the option to book with their American Express Card on the Ryanair website. With millions of American 
Express Cardmembers worldwide, we are delighted that Ryanair is welcoming our Cards.'

 The growth of the e cig has been short and has much promise with sales growth of over 300% more than Apple's 
growth rate. This is surely the industry to watch.
Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 09/24/2013 -- The e cig[2] is here to stay and this has been evidenced by the amount 
of attention that they are getting both from the general public and also from the federal authorities too. This 
innovative alternative to smoking has been created to be able to assist smokers to have a better smoking solution 
than using tobacco cigarettes which has meant that within the next decade electric cigarettes will dominate the 
entire smoking industry. The common belief that is held by most people is that e cigarettes are not effective and are 
as harmful if not worse to tobacco smoking.
 The reality is that there have not been any federal sanctioned studies into the effects of the e cig. Instead there 
have been many independent studies that have been carried out by independent and private entities, and all these 
studies have been short term and have been done in a controlled environment under clinical or laboratory 
conditions which are a far cry from the reality. In Europe there have been tests that have been done by nations 
whilst these have been short term tests there are long term tests into the effects of vapor cigarettes[3] are currently 
ongoing. And what the general consensus is that they are the best alternative for smoking even though more testing 
is needed. This has given rise to the allowing of e cigarette smoking in major European airlines such as Ryanair 
and even in the US airlines like American Airlines, Continental, and Southwest are starting to allow it.
 Since 2004 the e cig industry has grown in leaps and bounds in fact in 2012 they had total revenue of $ 500 million 
whilst for 2013 it is estimated to be over $1.5 billion. In comparison Apple in 2012 made $169 billion and it is 
estimated to make $205 billion; that is a growth of 21% whilst electronic cigarette brands[4] are growing by at least 
300%. In these tough economic times it goes to show that the need for a better smoking alternative is needed and 
smokeless cigarettes are seemingly looking like the best solution.
 This has been a remarkable growth created in the pursuit of making the best e cig[5], even when compared to the 
one of the most dominant industries which resulted in the in Iphone 5S (which garnered sales of $0.9 billion sales in 
a week). There have growth and it has been predicted to increase even more. In fact even Apple in its long and 
colorful history has not yet even been able to reach these levels of growth of the e cig.

 RIGA: Air navigation services company 'Latvijas gaisa satiksme' (LGS) has called off its claim against Irish low-fare 
airline 'Ryanair', as it has cleared its debt with the company, LGS informed the business information portal 
'Nozare.lv'.
 According to LGS, 'Ryanair' had repaid its debt to the company in full.
 As reported, this past August, 'Ryanair' repaid its principal debt to the air navigation services company LGS.
 'Ryanair' has repaid a total of EUR 846,335 (LVL 584,225) this year, covering its 2010/2011 debt commitments and 
this year's air navigation services.
 However, 'Ryanair' has a different perception of who should pay for air navigation services.
 The airline believes that the Riga International Airport should cover these services, contradicting Latvian and 
international laws.

Piper, where she had been a partner for three years.
She will be based in Eversheds' Dubai office, and is also qualified to practise in Australia and Malaysia. 
The Transfer Window is a regular round-up of recent legal moves in the UK and abroad.

 Cousin is joining alongside finance lawyer Michel Bauer, who takes the role of senior counsel. Bauer was 
previously at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank where he led the London-Paris legal team in charge of 
financing.
 Baker McKenzie's London office has hired Clifford Chance senior associate Paul Hibbert as a partner in its banking 
practice. Hibbert, whose practice focuses on acquisition and leverage finance, particularly in the infrastructure 
sector, becomes the fourth senior associate to join Bakers from the magic circle as a partner over the last two 
years.
 In Johannesburg, Bakers also hired corporate and MA partner Dhiren Ganasen and tax of counsel Mark Preiss, 
who join from Webber Wentzel and Ernst Young respectively. The firm's South African office has expanded rapidly 
since its launch in May 2012, and following the latest hires has a total of 67 lawyers and staff, including 14 partners.
 US firm Andrews Kurth has launched a London arbitration practice with a three-lawyer team hire from Chadbourne 
Parke. Melanie Willems, who joins as head of international arbitration, makes the move alongside senior associate 
Markus Esly - who joins as a partner - and associate Robert Blackett.
The Transfer Window: recent moves including Eversheds, Bakers and OC
 "Andrews Kurth is a leading law firm in the industries we focus on," commented Willems. "Our commercial 
contracts experience also fits in perfectly with the firm's aim of providing top-calibre legal service in the competitive 
London market."
 Norton Rose Fulbright has sealed the hire of long-serving Cleary Gottlieb Steen Hamilton Brussels partner James 
Modrall for its competition practice.
 Modrall, who has been a partner for 18 years at Cleary, joined the US firm in 1986. He specialises on EU and 
competition law, with focus on cross-border MA and EU financial services law. He is joining Norton Rose Fulbright's 
Brussels office.
 Modrall has acted on mandates including advising budget airline Ryanair on airline Flybe's planned €150m 
(£128m) acquisition of 43 short-haul routes earlier this year and representing TPG Capital on finance aspects of its 
$800m (£508m) takeover bid for hedge fund services company GlobeOp in 2012.
 Elsewhere, Norton Rose Fulbright has also boosted its Paris real estate practice with the hire of Hogan Lovells 
partner Jean-Pascal Bus. Bus, who has particular focus in litigation, planning and construction, joined Hogan 
Lovells in 2008 as a partner from French real estate boutique Lacourte Balas.
 Simmons Simmons has hired a partner duo for its Middle East practice. Arnaud Depierrefeu, a former partner at 
UGGC Associes' Qatar office, has joined the Doha-based corporate team while capital markets partner Haitham 
Hawashin, who previously worked at Jordan-headquartered firm Khalifeh Partners, will join the Abu Dhabi team in 
October.
 Eversheds' Italy arm has sealed the hire of Simmons Italy private equity chief and former board member Marco 
Franzini for its banking and private equity practice. Franzini has joined from Simmons' Milan office, which he joined 
as a partner in 1998 from Milan-headquartered firm De Berti Jacchia Franchini Forlani. Franzini has served on 
Simmons' strategy board and has also previously held posts as the firm's Italy managing partner and country head.
 Osborne Clarke has recruited Simmons international disputes partner Andrew Bartlett for its commercial litigation 
team. At Simmons he handled large-scale international disputes and coordinated proceedings in numerous 
countries, with a focus on high value litigation and international arbitration work. The firm has also strengthened in 
Europe with a double partner hire, including Claire Bouchenard, who joins in Paris from local firm B-Cube, where 
she was a founding partner. Her practice covers intellectual property, internet, commercial and advertising law. 
Meanwhile, in Brussels, corporate partner David Haex has joined the firm from Linklaters.
 Jones Day has added a partner to its London banking and finance team with the hire of Brian Conway from Latham 
Watkins. He has particular experience of acting for banks, financial institutions and borrowers on a range of 
domestic and international cross-border financing transactions. 
 DAC Beachcroft has also bolstered its corporate finance department with the hire of James Reed from Baker 
McKenzie, where he spent 12 years. He is the latest addition to the firm's Bristol commercial team which now 
comprises eight partners. Reed specialises in cross-border and domestic MA work with a particular focus in the 
energy, mining and infrastructure sectors.
 Squire Sanders has expanded its corporate team in Manchester with the appointment of MA and capital markets 
partner Daniel Liptroot from Eversheds. He follows former colleague Hannah Kendrick, who earlier this summer left 
Eversheds to join Squire Sanders' Leeds office. Liptrott specialises in corporate governance and capital markets 
transactions.
 Field Fisher Waterhouse has strengthened its Paris team with the recruitment of intellectual property specialist 
Nathalie Hadjadj-Cazier, who was a partner at Winston Strawn's local base and specialises in licensing, franchising

Dutch employment practice. Huisman specialises in all aspects of domestic and international employment law, as 
well as management issues such as the dismissal and reward of board members and executives.
 Baker Botts has added leading EU litigator Georg Berrisch to its Brussels office from Covington Burling LLP. 
Berrisch is a highly regarded litigator, in particular in the fields of competition law, state aid and trade matters in the 
EU. Baker Botts' Brussels office opened last September as part of a push to extend the reach of the firm's antitrust

RyanAir Issues Grieving Father Partial Refund After Charging Him For Flight Change
RyanAir Issues Grieving Father Partial Refund After Charging Him For Flight

 RyanAir has issued a partial refund to a passenger who had to change his ticket after his family died in a house fire 
last week.
 Dr. Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar had originally intended to take a Saturday morning flight from Dublin, Ireland, to 
his home in Leicester, England. But after an apparent act of arson killed his wife and three children[1], reports the 
Irish Independent, a RyanAir representative offered to change his ticket[2] for an earlier departure -- that is, if he 
was willing to pay €188 (more than $250).
 "I thought, given the circumstances, they might just let me transfer flights, as I had already paid for a return fare," 
Sattar told the Irish Daily Mail[3]. "I don't want to make a big deal about it but it did shock me. I really did not expect 
them to charge me." 
 He added that tears were streaming down his face as he spoke with the agent at the counter.
 Airlines have long offered "bereavement flights[4]" to customers who need flexibility to travel at the last moment 
because of an illness or death in the family. And while RyanAir, the discount carrier infamous for nickel-and-diming 
its passengers, technically has a policy in place[5] for such instances, the airline doesn't seem eager to implement 
it.
 In a statement to the BBC, a company representative offered "sincere condolences" and said RyanAir will provide 
Sattar "a full refund."[6]
 A representative also told Irish media that instances such as this have to be dealt with "on a case by case basis[7]. 
There's no other way. We're carrying 81 million passengers across 120 airports."
 The incident comes on the heels of a survey ranking RyanAir last in quality of service among 100 other brands, 
prompting RyanAir CEO Michael O'Leary to acknowledge[8] the company has an image problem. O'Leary said the 
airline will seek "to improve and to soften some of the harder edges in our service and in our image."

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] CAPTCHA REMOVED FOR INDIVIDUAL BOOKINGS FROM 30 
OCT, MOBILE APP (WAS €3) FREE FROM 1 OCT
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC) today (20 Sept) at its AGM in Dublin briefed shareholders on 
the new milestones recently achieved by the airline including:
·First EU airline to carry 9m passengers in a calendar month (August). ·First EU airline to carry 80m passengers 
p.a. ·Traffic set to grow from 80m to 110m p.a. by FY'19. ·175 new B-737 aircraft ordered. ·10 year low cost deal at 
Warsaw Modlin concluded. ·10 year low cost deal at London Stansted agreed. 
 To celebrate these milestones, Ryanair briefed shareholders on its plans to roll out a new website and digital 
marketing strategy which will include:
·Launching the @Ryanair Twitter page. ·Removing the Recaptcha security feature for individual passengers from 
30 Oct next (Recaptcha will remain in place for high volume bookers, screenscrapers, travel agents etc.). ·Ryanair's 
mobile app will from Tues 1 Oct be downloadable free of charge (previously €3). ·Booking flow redesign to go live in 
December. ·Passenger registration/retention service live for summer 2014, substantially reducing the time it takes 
to complete bookings.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'Our recent agreements with Boeing, Warsaw Modlin and London Stansted show that Ryanair continues to widen 
our substantial unit cost advantage over all other EU airlines. We will use these lower costs to offer even more 
lower fares to Ryanair passengers across all EU markets in which we operate, and already these fares (starting 
from €15 one way) are delivering increased bookings and higher advance loads, albeit at lower yields this autumn.
After a summer during which Ryanair's operations set new record highs, with 94% of flights on-time in August, less 
than 1 bag per 3,000 passengers misplaced and less than 1 cancellation for every 10,000 flights operated, 
Ryanair's unbeatable low fares continue to attract new passengers from competitors, while our unbeatable 
customer service keeps them coming back for more.
Our primary focus this winter will be to significantly invest in, and improve, the Ryanair.com website, our mobile 
platform and our interaction with passengers using social media. We are pleased to remove Recaptcha from 
November for individual passengers, although the security feature will remain in place for high volume or multiple IP 
addresses in order to deter larger travel agents, screenscrapers and others who flood our website seeking fare 
quotes, and diminish our website's accessibility for individual passengers. 
Ryanair Rolls Out Digital Marketing Strategy At AGM
This winter will also see a rolling programme of development to improve the Ryanair.com website, make it easier for 
passengers to navigate, quicker for them to locate our all-inclusive price quotes, identify availability of our lower fare 
promotions and book Ryanair's great fares for themselves and their families. These improvements will be 
accompanied by a new digital marketing strategy which will see Ryanair switch a significant proportion of its 
marketing budget from old to new media, with a particular focus on mobile and social media platforms.'

Sneaky User-Interface Tricks Web Designers Use To Manipulate You
Sneaky User-Interface Tricks Web Designers Use To Manipulate You

Sep 20, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 For most, the difference between good and bad web design is whether or not a site is aesthetically pleasing and 
easy to use.
 That view ignores the darker side of design.
 Just as there are unethical "black hat" tactics for making a site appear in search engine results, web designers 
have come up with practices designed to trick people into signing up for services and buying products that, under 
other circumstances, they wouldn't.
 Dark Patterns[1] is a site dedicated to revealing these tricks and the sites that use them. Harry Brignull, one of the 
site's creators, has put together a presentation detailing some of their sketchiest tactics. Not all the sites in this 
presentation still have their UI's organized this way — Brignull's data covers years — but at one time, they all did. 
Brignull starts by pointing out that many of these tricks come from a lesson learned via studies of organ donor 
programs around the world.
In countries where you have to sign up to be in the national organ donor programs, the percentages that opt-in are 
rather low. In countries where you are signed up by default, almost no one opts-out. Lesson learned: make it as 
easy as possible to sign up, because once you have them they probably won't leave.
This lesson applies to all kinds of businesses. LA Fitness only requires a few clicks to sign up for a membership 
while canceling involves sending a handwritten note via the mail.
Same thing with Orbitz: Buying a ticket only takes minutes, while canceling a flight can take up to two days in some 
cases.
It even comes up on charity websites. Oxfam, a Third World poverty relief organization, has its donation sign-up set 
to recur monthly by default.
By doing so, Oxfam hopes that people won't notice that they've signed up to pay more than once and won't bother 
to opt-out once they do.
Sneaky User-Interface Tricks Web Designers Use To Manipulate You
While setting a toggle to "monthly" is one thing, but it's not as ethically questionable as an online retailer adding an 
additional product to your cart without your permission.
Comet, the U.K. retailer, added a $40 case to Brignull's order when he was looking at an iPad in the hopes that he 
would think, "Well, maybe I need this."
Of course, those two make opting out quite easy if you're paying attention to the forms. Ryanair, the Irish airline, 
does something even more tricky.
After picking a flight, there's a page where you input your passenger information...
Within that section, there's the option to buy travel insurance. Notice that there isn't a Yes/No option, but a drop-
down menu for choosing country of residence.
The opt-out is buried within the countries available.
If you don't choose a country (which would bring you to the screen where you purchase insurance) or opt-out, 
Ryanair gives an error message that highlights that you should pick a country — making you more likely to buy the 
insurance.
Despite the murky ethics of making it easy to opt-in but hard to opt-out, the tactic is used by a huge number of sites 
online. 
That includes Facebook, which makes most posts and profile information public by default.
That's not the only way websites are fooling users. Some are trying to pass off knock-offs as iPhones and other 
gadgets...

 Yellen or Kohn[1]? Twenty-four hours after yelling that the taper tease was all a con trick, markets mostly retreated 
to the sounds of silence on Thursday. Shares slipped slightly and traded in a tight range. A bad week for Larrys[2] 
continued as Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL[3]) Mr. Ellison was accused of going AWOL[4]. As for Mr. Summers, his 
nemesis (nemesii?) the Winklevii[5] must despise Mark Zuckerberg even more[6] after a broker boost[7] sent 
surging Facebook (NASDAQ:FB[8]) up 1.66% to a fresh peak. The twins would be well advised to Take-Two 
(NASDAQ:TTWO[9]) and call us in the morning after that stock gained 1.34% on the fifth iteration of its Grand Theft 
Auto. Their shares are certainly more of a steal than Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA[10]), up another 7.04% to an 
historic best.
 No top-tier economic data due today - a singularly awful one in stock market history[11] - but Olive Garden owner 
Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI[12]) releases results. It's also a "quadruple witching[13]" Friday, and they rarely 
lack action. (This phenomenon is not to be mistaken for the quartet of Fed officials addressing audiences this 
afternoon, in the form of Esther George (12:30 p.m. Eastern), Daniel Tarullo (12:40 p.m.), James Bullard (12:55 
p.m.), and Narayana Kocherlakota (1:45 p.m.)
American Public Education (NASDAQ:APEI[14]): Stifel slashes the stock to Hold from Buy.
ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT[15]): The steel name is reduced to Sector Perform from Outperform at RBC Capital 
Markets.
Cardinal Financial (NASDAQ:CFNL[16]): Concerned about the company's slower mortgage banking originations, 
FBR Capital cuts it to Perform from Outperform.
Clorox (NYSE:CLX[17]): Credit Suisse moves the household cleaning name to Underperform from Neutral.
Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD[18]): Shares are moved to Market Perform from Outperform at JMP Securities.
Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT[19]): Morgan Stanley moves the stock to Equal-Weight from Overweight.
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP[20]): The equity is lower this morning on a downgrade to Underperform from Perform by 
William Blair.
Prudential (NYSE:PRU[21]): Goldman Sachs pulls the insurance outfit from its list of Conviction Buys.
SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI[22]): Shares get slashed to Sell from Neutral at Goldman.

 Squeezed in between the excitement of Fed Wednesday and quadruple witching Friday, Thursday was an 
instantly-forgettable piggy (or tapir) in the middle for the markets. The SP 500 Index (INDEXSP:.INX) snapped a 
four-session advance, even as Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN[1]) became its first component in history to finish with a 
four-figure price tag. The largest online travel site will now set you back $1,000.62 per share, this despite its 
principal product being so easy even an ape can do it[2]. Billboard maker Lamar Advertising (NASDAQ:LAMR[3]) 
advanced 5.15% and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL[4]), whose philandering executive once found himself plastered all over 
a Times Square billboard[5], shrugged off an iffy analyst initiation[6] and cautious earnings outlook to end up. 
Elsewhere, downgraded[7] Dow (INDEXDJX:.DJI[8]) member Disney (NYSE:DIS[9]) dropped 2.07% after delaying 
Pixar's film The Good Dinosaur for 18 months. Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL[10]), however, encountered no such 
problems and jumped 1.90%.
 No top-tier economic data due today - a singularly awful one in stock market history[11] - but Olive Garden owner 
Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI[12]) releases results. As mentioned, it's also a "quadruple witching[13]" Friday, 
and they rarely lack action. (This phenomenon is not to be mistaken for the quartet of Fed officials addressing 
audiences this afternoon, in the form of Esther George (12:30 p.m. Eastern), Daniel Tarullo (12:40 p.m.), James 
Bullard (12:55 p.m.), and Narayana Kocherlakota (1:45 p.m.)
Ameren (NYSE:AEE[14]): Shares are boosted to Overweight from Equal Weight by Barclays.
Bank of Hawaii (NYSE:BOH[15]): Barclays hoists the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight.
Diamondrock Hospitality (NYSE:DRH[16]): The stock is now Buy from Hold at MLV Co, whose price objective also 
increases to $13 from $11.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB[17]): Another day, another broker boost[18] for the social networking name, today taken to 
Outperform from Perform at Cowen on higher mobile revenues. The price objective, previously $29, increases to 
$53.
MetLife (NYSE:MET[19]): MET is added to the Conviction Buy List at Goldman Sachs.
Pier 1 Imports (NYSE:PIR[20]): After yesterday's plunge, PIR is upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Credit 
Suisse.
J Sainsbury (OTCMKTS:JSAIY[21]): The British grocery giant is bucking a broadly lower London tape today after 
being taken to Neutral from Sell by Citigroup. Its Q2 earnings release is seen as showing margin strength by the 
bank.
Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY[22]): The low-cost carrier, which this week had to kick a bunch of boozy Brits 
off a flight bound for the party island of Ibiza[23], is now Neutral from Underweight at HSBC Securities.
Stock Upgrades: Ryanair Starts the Party Way Before Arriving in Ibiza
Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN[24]): Shares are upgraded to Buy from Hold at Canaccord Genuity, which says a 
recent sell off is overdone. The target is $48.
Volvo (OTCMKTS:VOLVY[25]): Société Générale gives the Swedish car company a Buy-from-Hold boost.

Low Cost Airlines: Three Key Threats
Low Cost Airlines: Three Key Threats
Mercenary Trader
September 18, 2013 Wednesday 12:46 PM EST

Sep 18, 2013 (Mercenary Trader:http://www.mercenarytrader.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Low-cost airline carriers are vulnerable to significant declines if analyst growth expectations fail to pan out.
 Compressed forward PE ratios suggest institutional money managers (the real buyers and sellers) are more 
pessimistic than consensus estimates imply. Rising oil prices, economic weakness, and thin-margin business 
models are three key threats for the group.
 The big-three low-cost carriers are:
Southwest (LUV) - The world's largest low-cost airline. Jetblue (JBLU) - A dominant player on the Eastern 
Seaboard and in the Caribbean. Spirit (SAVE) - Ultra-low cost carrier focused on the US Southeast, Caribbean and 
Latin America.
 At current prices, 1-year forward PEs represent significantly compressed valuations. This implies that active money 
managers are skeptical when it comes to analyst expectations for earnings growth in 2014.
 The fact that buy-side investors are heavily discounting future earnings expectations helps to confirm our 
reservations on the group. There are three key sources of risk in play for low-cost airlines:
 1) Stubbornly High Oil Prices
 Jet fuel prices are a major driver of airline profit margins, particularly at low-cost carriers where price sensitivity is 
higher.
 In 2011, when oil prices hit $110 per barrel, profit margins for LUV, JBLU and SAVE were all compressed 
significantly. For Southwest, the ramp in oil prices actually pushed profit margins into negative territory.
 Supply disruptions in Lybia, Iraq and Canada have pushed current oil prices higher and U.S. refineries are 
processing crude oil at record rates, leaving little spare capacity. The risk that conflict in Syria spills over to larger oil 
producers in the Middle East inevitably increases the geopolitical risk premium of oil.
 http://www.mercenarytrader.com/are-you-signal-poor-would-you-like-to-be-signal-rich/2) Economic Weakness
 While the U.S. economy has demonstrated resilience this year, economic stability is sowing the seed for the Fed's 
tapering of its Quantitative Easing program.
 U.S. monetary policy has turned a corner. Barring clear evidence of slowdown or the economy hitting 'stall speed,' 
interest rates will rise from historic low levels. This could impact low-cost carriers via middle-class belt tightening.
 Evidence of slowing retail sales suggests that, while affluent Americans are spending freely, 'ordinary' Americans 
are still in trouble. Rising interest rates could further dampen middle-class spending and cut into travel revenues.
 The economy slowing down would put pressure on middle- class consumers, resulting in a lose-lose scenario. (If 
economic stability is maintained, higher interest rates will pressure middle class consumers, and if economic 
stability deteriorate, job growth and consumer confidence will come under pressure.)
Low Cost Airlines: Three Key Threats
 3) Vulnerable Low-Cost Business Model
 The third problem is the inherent vulnerability of the low-margin business model, particularly for LUV and JBLU 
whose margins are below 5%. High jet fuel prices can cut directly into air carriers' profits but the most obvious 
measure airlines can take when faced with a soft retail environment is to slash prices.
 Reducing the quality of onboard offerings is a reputational risk LUV and JBLU have to balance with letting margins 
decline, while SAVE as an ultra-low-cost carrier has virtually nothing left to cut.
 A good example of this vulnerability can bee seen by looking at the recent 'turbulence' in European low-cost carrier 
Ryan Air's stock (RYAAY).
 
 RyanAir is one of the leading low-cost carriers in Europe. After giving a profit warning citing increased competition 
in the low-cost carrier space and weakness in forward bookings on Wednesday 9/4, RYAAY's stock dropped 11% 
on the day.
 RYAAY's recent profit warning shows that low-cost carriers are not above economic realities and any slow-down 
for American consumers would make Wall Street's estimates unreachable, particularly as margins are eroded by 
high oil prices.
 While large carriers face many of the same risks as low-cost carriers, low growth prospects have clearly already 
affected their valuations. There is little more compression to be witnessed in the forward valuations of larger carriers 
and it seems both the buy-side and sell-side agree on relatively bleak prospects for the group. 
 The large carrier group thus provides less opportunity on the short side as multiples already reflect relevant risks.
 Are the low-cost carriers a good short at current levels?
 Price action suggests mounting concern. The $XAL airline index has registered a potentially significant topping 
pattern on the weekly chart, with LUV, JBLU and SAVE similarly stalled in multi-month topping formations.
 The Wall Street analyst consensus of 20-30% earnings growth year on year would be impressive for most any 
public company in this slow growth, stall-speed economic environment - let alone for airlines exposed to multiple 
external risks well out of their control.
 Market participants are already skeptical of Wall Street's estimated growth prospects for the low-cost airline group. 
Should the group show weakness after the Fed's tapering announcement, low-cost air carriers should be an 
attractive short opportunity, particularly if oil prices remain high.
 Based on strong potential for lowered 2014 estimates (assuming historical price earnings valuations), the big-three 
low-cost carriers could reasonably drop 20% from current levels. We are monitoring the price action along with the 
macro picture to identify attractive shorting opportunities.

SUMMER 2014 SCHEDULE RELEASED WITH 4 NEW ROUTES (BORDEAUX, DORTMUND, LISBON RABAT)
Ryanair and Manchester Airport Group (MAG), today (16 Sep) announced that they had concluded a 10 year 
growth agreement at London Stansted Airport, which will see Ryanair grow its traffic at Stansted by over 50%, from 
13.2m passengers in 2012 to over 20m p.a. in return for a package of lower costs and more efficient facilities at 
Stansted. This agreement will account for up to 25% of Ryanair's 5 year growth plans to 2019. Ryanair expects its 
Stansted traffic in year 1 of this 10-year deal to grow from 13.2m to over 14.5m.
Ryanair has today released its Stansted summer 2014 schedule (at www.ryanair.com[2]), with a total of 120 routes, 
including 4 new routes to Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat, which will feature: 43 based aircraft in Stansted

Stansted traffic grow by over 50%, from 13.2m in 2012 to over 20m p.a. in return for lower costs and more efficient 
facilities at Stansted. This agreement, which will create over 7000 new jobs in Stansted, proves how UK airports 
can flourish when released from the dead hand of the BAA monopoly and is the first dramatic initiative by MAG to 
reverse 7 years of decline, during which Stansted's traffic fell from 23.8m to 17.5m. 
As Stansted's biggest airline, Ryanair looks forward to a decade of growing traffic, routes and jobs at Stansted. We 
are also pleased to release our Stansted summer 2014 schedule with 120 routes, including 4 new routes to 
Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat, which have gone on sale today on the            www.ryanair.com[3]

both Ryanair and Stansted, and we're delighted to be supporting the airline's growth over the next ten years.

confidence, and shows how we are succeeding in transforming Stansted under new ownership. Stansted has a 
really bright future in providing international connectivity for the UK.'

 Twenty five years ago, a giant black and white killer whale decorated the fuselage of a Southwest Airlines 737-300 
as part of a promotional deal with Sea World.
 A decade later, All Nippon Airlines decorated the first of several planes with Pokeman characters. Southwest got 
heads to turn in 2009 when it put the image of a bikini clad supermodel on the side of one of its jets.
 On Wednesday, the latest attention-grabbing jet will land at Los Angeles International Airport: The Hello Kitty 
plane.
 A Boeing 777-300ER flown by Taiwan-based EVA Air and painted to honor the hugely popular feline will start to 
make three regular flights from LAX to Taipei.
 Passengers on the plane might suffer from a Hello Kitty overdose. The cat will be emblazed on the pillow covers as 
well as the hand soap and tissues in the bathroom. Even the flight attendants will be wearing Hello Kitty uniforms.
 And if you need more Hello Kitty in your life, you can buy Hello Kitty items onboard, such as necklaces, pins, bags 
and aprons.

 Sept. 12--A round-trip ticket from New York to Houston sold Thursday for $5 on the United Airlines 
[http://www.latimes.com/topic/economy-business-finance/transportation-industry/air-transportation-industry/united-

 The sale was one of an unknown number of ticket sold after a computer glitch at one of the nation's largest airlines 
began to spit out ultra-low fares for about two hours.
 How low? How about $2.50 for a flight from Washington, D.C., to Austin, Texas?

 United Airlines officials briefly shut down the online reservation system before announcing that the problem had 
been fixed by early afternoon.
 An airline spokeswoman said the carrier had yet to decide whether it would honor the super-low fares. But fliers 
who bought the ultra-cheap tickets already were pressing United through its Twitter page to make good on the 
deals.
BLOG: Money and Company: Glitch causes United to sell tickets for as little as $2.50
 "Not sure why so cheap but I hope u honor price," Craig Bean wrote in a tweet to United after buying two tickets 
from Washington to Austin for $7.50.
 Computer problems last August and November temporarily grounded hundreds of United flights across the country.
 The problems may have started when United merged its reservation system with that of Continental Airlines 
starting in 2010, according to industry experts.

QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION2013. No 91377
 Between:
RYANAIR LIMITED
 Plaintiff
 and
ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS LIMITED and
 ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS (IRELAND) LIMITED
 Defendant
STATEMENT IN OPEN COURT
 A recent article about Ryanair referred to claims made by a group describing itself as a "Ryanair Pilot Group" and 
other claims broadcast in a Channel 4 TV Dispatches programme. Ryanair does not accept the results of the survey 
Daily Mail Settles Ryanair Defamation Action
conducted by the interim council of this group, whose chairman is a KLM pilot, or that the group represents the 
views of the majority of Ryanair's pilots.
 In relation to the three fuel emergency landings in Valencia over 12 months ago on 26th July 2012, we accept that 
the official report produced by the Irish safety agencies confirmed that all three aircraft took on extra fuel, all three 
aircraft flew for over one hour more than planned (due to adverse weather and diversions from Madrid to Valencia). 
All three aircraft fully complied with EU safety rules when landing safely in Valencia.
Ryanair has made clear that if pilots have legitimatesafety concerns they shouldreport them either directly to 
Ryanair, or to the Irish Aviation Authority, using their confidential safety reporting systems.
We also accept the recent confirmation issued by the independent Irish Aviation Authority that "Ryanair's safety is 
on a par with the safest airlines in Europe" and acknowledge Ryanair's 29 year safety record.
PRESS STATEMENT (Paul Tweed)
 My client acknowledges and appreciates the prompt and comprehensive manner in which the Mail have acted to 
set the record straight in relation to the reporting of what were totally false and misleading statements, originating 
from a Channel 4 Dispatches programme which remains the subject of ongoing litigation.
 We are continuing to vigorously pursue Channel 4 in relation to their outrageous defamatory broadcast which 
sought to undermine our client's internationally acknowledged safety record spanning three decades.
We will be seeking to have our client's libel actions against Channel 4 Dispatches and others listed before the High 
Court in Dublin as soon as possible.
 Paul Tweed
 Senior Partner
Johnsons
 Dublin | London | Belfast
 PRESS STATEMENT (Captain Ray Conway)
 As Chief Pilot of Ryanair I am very satisfied with the comprehensive vindication and acknowledgement of Ryanair's 
29 year safety record by the DailyMail before the Court this morning. 
While I am unable to make specific comments concerning our ongoing legal proceedings regarding Channel 4's 
Dispatches programme, I wish to emphasise that Ryanair cannot and will not tolerate what were totally unjustified 
and inappropriate allegations in relation to our industry leading safety.
Safety has been, and will always be, the absolute priority for Ryanair, as demonstrated by our 29 year industry 
leading record, and by the Irish Aviation Authority's recent confirmation that Ryanair's safety 'is on a par with the 
safest airlines in Europe'.
Daily Mail Settles Ryanair Defamation Action
Ryanair has instructed our lawyers to take all necessary action to have our defamation actions against Channel 4 
Dispatches and all others brought before the Courts at the earliest opportunity.

 Good news! If you are Ben Smith, then you will be loving the all new 'Feel at Home' facility from UK operator, 3. 
 Ben Smith, good friend of Mobile Industry Review, Editor of Wireless Worker[1] and co-presenter of our joint 
podcast, 361 Degrees[2], has family in Ireland.
 This means he routinely goes there for the weekend. In fact he's that organised that I think he's booked his Ryanair 
flights for the next 6 months already. He's also a 3 customer. And now he won't have to bother with roaming 
charges — because with 'Feel at Home', he can call, text and get online at no additional cost. His existing domestic 
3 service plan applies in Ireland and 6 other countries (Austria, Australia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden). 
 It turns out that Smith is also off to Italy on holiday shortly so he is rather happy.
 He'll be able to avoid the somewhat expensive roaming costs that still apply in Europe — and the prohibitively 
stupid roaming costs that normally apply in Australia.
 A good few years ago, 3 used to do this. They called it '3 Like Home'. I thought it was brilliant. I used it in Italy a few 
times. 
 Then they canned it. David Murphy over at Mobile Marketing Magazine picked up the closure story[3] a whopping 
four years ago. 
 Back then, 'free' roaming on 3′s sister networks was extraordinary. It was a real shame they switched it off. The 
network's PR team did their best at spinning it, but I felt it was an error. Roaming has been such a hot topic over the 
past few years — enough to compel the EU to legislate — that 3 would have been held as a cut above the other 
networks thanks to their sister-peering arrangement. Indeed I'm sure it would have been particularly difficult for 
other networks to justify why they didn't offer sister-network peering when little old 3 did. 
 By coming into line with the other networks, 3 was relegated to also-ran at the back of the class and they were 
especially late to offer roaming packages. 
 Anyway, it's back. All 3 customers are automatically enrolled so you don't need to opt in. 
 And if you live, work or have family in any of the 3 sister network countries, it would probably be worth you 
swapping to 3 to take advantage of Feel at Home. More details from 3 here[4].

 The status of e cigarettes in the US is vastly different to that in the EU. This can be based on the lack of evidence 
about their negative effects.
Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 09/10/2013 -- In the current rate of bickering about allowing the e cigarette[2] to be 
more readily available to buy and to use in the US, there have been a constant flow of positive news coming out of 
Europe regarding the effects of these products. The latest batch of these results was announced at the recently 
ended European Respiratory Society meeting that was held recently in Spain. This goes to prove that there are 
currently a vast amount of tests that are being conducted in the EU and whilst all of the results that have been 
announced have been short term results, there are currently some long term tests that are being conducted and the 
results will be released in due time. 
This is in sharp contrast to the limited amount of data that is being used as the basis of the claims to try and justify 
the future possible banning of sales online and the restrictions in the retail distribution of the e cigarette in the US 
that are being considered. It has been suggested that the FDA take a leaf from the EMA, who whilst not fully 
approved the wanton use of e cigarette liquid[3] products, it has resulted in approval by major airlines such as 
Ryanair which allows its passengers to vape during flights.
This is has been called a large improvement to the current status quo which is based on the use of results that have 
been obtained under clinical conditions and in a controlled environment. Instead the results that would carry weight 
are those that have been attained in a real world scenario and without the presence of clinically scientific conditions 
that make it easier to get the best e cigarette[4]. it has been claimed that these results would be closer to real life 
conditions.
That is why in reality there has not yet been a single documented causality case that can be attributed to e 
cigarettes, let alone a fatality. Yet there have been continuous negativity due to the actions of e cigarette brands[5], 
maybe it is time for those in power to give it some thought.

 Passenger fees and other extra charges generated $27.1 billion for airlines around the world in 2012, with major 
carriers like United, Delta and American airlines leading the revenue race.
 In 2012, 53 airlines around the globe collected $27.1 billion in so-called ancillary revenue, compared with $22.6 
billion 
collected 
by 
50 
carriers 
in 
2011, 
according 
to 
a 
new 
report 
[http://www.ideaworkscompany.com/category/press-releases] by IdeaWorks Co., a Wisconsin consultant on airline 
fees. The study was sponsored by CarTrawler, a Dublin, Ireland-based provider of car rental distribution systems.
 Extra charges such as baggage fees and charges to upgrade to roomier seats have become a major source of 
revenue for airlines since 2008, when surging fuel prices forced airline to find another way to generate money 
without raising airfares.
 Low-cost airlines, such as Spirit Airlines [           http://www.latimes.com/topic/economy-business-
finance/transportation-industry/air-transportation-industry/spirit-airlines-ORCRP017335.topic] and Allegiant Air, led 
the high-fee, low-fare trend over the last few years. But the IdeaWorks study says that major carriers, particularly 
big airlines in Europe, are increasingly turning to passenger fees to boost revenue.
 "Statistics help tell the ancillary revenue story and every year key numbers are getting bigger," the study says. 
"The most aggressive airlines easily generate more than 20% of their revenues from a la carte fees."
 United Airlines [           http://www.latimes.com/topic/economy-business-finance/transportation-industry/air-
transportation-industry/united-air-lines-ORCRP017350.topic] led all carriers in fee revenue with $5.4 billion, followed 
by Delta Air Lines [           http://www.latimes.com/topic/economy-business-finance/transportation-industry/air-
transportation-industry/delta-air-lines-ORCRP002110.topic] with $2.6 billion and American with $2 billion, according 
to the study.
 Florida-based Spirit Airlines generated 38.5% of its revenue from extra fees -- the most of any carrier--followed by 
Allegiant Air with 30% and Britain's Jet2.com with 27%, according to the study.
 Meanwhile, the average domestic airfare rose 3% from 2011 to 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of 
Transportation Statistics.

airBaltic' losses fall to LVL 8.7 million in H1

Sep 05, 2013 (LETA (Latvia National News Agency):http://feeds.feedblitz.com/prorssleta Delivered by Newstex)
 RIGA: Latvian national airline 'airBaltic' losses in the first six months decreased to LVL 8.7 million, which is EUR 
21.12 million (LVL 14.78 million) less than in the first half of 2012, the airline's CEO Martin Gauss told a press 
conference today.
 In the second quarter, the airline even posted a profit of LVL 1 million.
 The number of 'airBaltic' passengers decreased 5 percent to 1.34 million passengers in the first half-year, whereas 
revenue-per-passenger increased EUR 6.86 to EUR 101.56 (LVL 71.38). The airline's total revenue was LVL 107.3 
million in the first six months this year, which is 2 percent more than in the same period last year. Furthermore, the 
airline's passenger turnover reduced just 1 percent in the second quarter.
 Martin Gauss commented that the company had been posting good results the past few months, and that May was 
the most successful of these months.
 While the airline's losses were originally projected at LVL 16 million this year, this projection has been now lowered 
to no more than LVL 10 million, said Gauss. The airline hopes to count LVL 4 million in profit in 2014 and earn a 
profit of LVL 6 million in 2015.
 Fleet renovation, cost monitoring, capacity management and improving efficiency all contribute to the company 
earning more and losing less money. 'airBaltic' expects to receive the new-model 'Bombardier' planes at the end of 
2015.
 Gauss said at the press conference that the airline was looking for a suitable investor, but declined to further 
comment on this. He also said that the European Commission's investigation continued and had not produced any 
results so far, and that the airline's experts were also working on the case. Gauss could not say in how many 
lawsuits 'airBaltic' was actually involved now, but he did say that the airline had not lost a single one as yet. If a 
company has money, there may be many people who try to make a grab for it, added Gauss.
 Gauss went on to say that 'airBaltic' was oriented toward lower costs when compared to the traditional airlines, but 
it nevertheless was not a low-cost carrier such as 'Ryanair'. The company has an extensive range of offers to 
clients - from business class to tickets that cost LVL 19. Thanks to its low prices, 'airBaltic' can successfully 
compete with 'Ryanair' in Riga.
 Gauss declined to reveal which were the most profitable routes for 'airBaltic', except that these included those 
destinations to which the airline flew the most frequently. 'airBaltic' is not planning to introduce a hand luggage fee, 
and this could only be considered if most other airlines adopt one, he said.
 'airBaltic' losses in 2012 reduced approximately 73 million, from LVL 83.5 million in 2011 to LVL 22.8 million last 
year.
airBaltic' losses fall to LVL 8.7 million in H1
 'airBaltic' is a joint-stock company that was established in 1995. The primary shareholder is Latvian state with 99.8 
percent of stock.

 Dublin: Shares in Ryanair have suffered their biggest drop in four years after the budget airline issued a rare profit 
warning over weaker-than-expected autumn ticket sales.
 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says the airline, which typically exceeds its profit forecasts, now expects 
to fall short of its previous outlook.
 The company's shares fell nearly 15 percent to 5.78 euros ($7.62), a five-month low and their biggest drop since 
October 2009.
 O'Leary told a conference call Wednesday that Ryanair now could struggle to reach its original lower-end sales 
target of 570 million euros ($751 million) for the fiscal year ending in March. He says sales are unexpectedly weak 
for the September-November period amid stronger competition in key British, Spanish and Scandinavian markets. 
Ryanair last issued a profits warning in 2004.

 How the e cig got to become the powerhouse that it is now and regardless of the future regulations, its domination 
is inevitable.
Austin, TX -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 09/05/2013 -- In the 9 years that the e cig[2] has been in production and circulation it 
has created records and milestones that no other industry cannot even get close to. This is in spite of its current 
spat that it is facing from both the federal government and from several civic groups that consider it a health hazard 
and yet it continues to make history which can be proved quantitatively and qualitatively. And yet regardless of all 
these achievements the signs are only saying that the future is going to be as prosperous as the past.
The most common indicator of the achievements of the e cig is based on the high numbers of users that are 
existing currently. This is usually based on the fact that 20% of all tobacco smokers have tried them, and when 
considering this it makes sense that not all of them will adopt it as their main smoking device. Also it must be noted 
that so far there has not yet been a single recorded casualty, fatality based on the use of vapor cigarettes[3], whilst 
there have been several incidents where the device has malfunctioned with causing harm to the surrounding 
property, these were isolated manufacturing defects and not a constant production issue like the presence of tar in 
tobacco.
In 2009 electronic cigarette brands[4] got a major boost when Ryanair became the first airline to allow passengers 
the use of the e cig during flights. This was a stamp of approval for this industry. In fact there has not been a single 
reported incident that resulted in the e cigs causing problems in flights until now especially in flights across the EU. 
This is in spite that for technologies that have been in existence for a long time and they are just starting to get this 
level of approval.
The basic truth is that the e cig are not going anywhere and regardless of the upcoming regulations; they are 
making a revolution in the smoking scenario. And despite the how long it may take to reach the ultimate target of 
producing the best e cig[5], it is a guaranteed that it is coming.

'Philomena' impresses, Gilliam goes into black hole in Venice

 Judi Dench and Steve Coogan's heart-tugging 'Philomena' continued to garner praise at the Venice Film Festival, 
while director Terry Gilliam's 'The Zero Theorem' took viewers into a dystopian world in the latest competition 
offerings on Monday.
 Gilliam's film, which his legions of fans hope will mark a return to form for the maker of the cult classics 'Twelve 
Monkeys' and 'Brazil,' stars Christoph Waltz as a reclusive number cruncher whose computer rig resembles a video 
game. Haunted by visions of a black hole, he has no friends, talks about himself in the first person plural and works 
for a 'management' that wants to prove that everything equals nothing. It elicited a few boos at the first festival 
showing but young Italian film bloggers said it captured the way people communicate and interact in the Internet 
age.
 'Since Facebook, we work at home, we love at home and we never see each other,' Matteo Bernardini of website 
Pointblank (www.pointblank.it) said after seeing the film, which also stars a singing pizza box.
 Trade publication Variety said the main buzz as the festival hit midpoint — between the opening with space drama 
'Gravity' last Wednesday and the awarding of the Golden Lion on Saturday — was around 'Philomena' and two 
other films, 'Joe' and 'Tracks.'
 The Nicolas Cage vehicle 'Joe' tells the story of an ex-con mentoring a boy from a violent background and 'Tracks' 
is based on the true story of a young woman's voyage of self discovery in a trek across the Australian desert with 
four camels.
 A serious film with a laugh
 Based on the real-life story of an elderly Irish woman's search for her child after nuns forced her to give him up for 
adoption, 'Philomena' stars Dench in the title role and British comic Coogan as a world-weary journalist who agrees 
to write her story to try to rescue his flagging career.
 'I was crying like crazy,' one man who did not give his name said as he beat a hasty exit from a screening. 
Audiences packing rows to see the film have been crying, laughing and applauding. One of the biggest laughs 
comes when Dench, whose impersonation of an Irishwoman is uncanny, flies to America with Coogan to track down 
her child, who would now be middle-aged. Coogan, as journalist Martin Sixsmith, is used to business class, but 
Philomena is excited by the offer of a free cocktail. 'This is lovely, Martin,' Dench says. 'You have to pay for 
everything on Ryanair' — a reference to the European budget airline.
 The film, co-written by Coogan, who is a household name in Britain for his TV comedy about radio host Alan 
Partridge, strikes a good balance between drama and humor, Swedish critic Gunnar Rehlin of TT Spektra told 
'Philomena' impresses, Gilliam goes into black hole in Venice
Reuters. 'It's a serious film but with a laugh in the midst of all the necrophilia and etcetera,' Rehlin said, referring to 
the grim themes such as taboo sex, domestic violence and incest that have permeated festival offerings this year.
 Coogan, in an interview with Reuters, said adding a comic touch made the story more moving and palatable. 'That 
was my sort of dream in my head,' he said, adding, 'Wouldn't it be amazing if someone like Judi Dench would play 
this old Irish lady, I could play this journalist?'
 Future on a low budget
 'The Zero Theorem' director Gilliam, who is yet to complete his ambitious project to adapt Cervantes's classic 'Don 
Quixote,' said he shot the new film in Bucharest, Romania, because it was cheaper than London. 'We were 
basically in the real world trying to make a surreal, futuristic movie,' Gilliam told a news conference. 'So it's that 
dynamic that is both dynamic, infuriating and surprising but this is the end result.'
 He said the film in part shows that the promise of the Internet to put everyone in touch with each other and with all 
knowledge may not be all it is cracked up to be. The Arab Spring 'was possible because of young people being able 
to communicate as they do with the web,' Gilliam said. 'But then I wonder … wow, we see the exact same people 
that were running Egypt back in control. So I don't know, I worry.'
 'And I think if I can make a film that gets us talking, discussing, thinking, arguing, then that's a step towards a better 
solution for whatever problems we are dealing with.'

 September has historically been the market's most punk month, but Henry Ford (NYSE:F[1]) famously said, 
"History is bunk," and, with his stock surging 3.49% to post its best gain of 2013, who are we to argue? Car 
companies led equities higher, even as another road rage incident involving Nasdaq's (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC[2]) 
"defensive driver[3]" threatened to derail the rally. Among stocks on the move, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL[4]) 
advanced 2.07% as an analyst established a $777 target on the tech titan[5]. The same symmetrical sell side 
researcher started the year by cutting his prior $1,111 target to $888[6], although $666 would surely have been a 
much better reflection of the equity's devilish action over subsequent months.
A ratings reduction[7] saw Dublin's own Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[8]) implode 8.90%. If such a horror show is 
enough to drive shareholders to drink hometown hero Guinness, better hold that thought[9]. Elsewhere John Thain, 
whose toilet tastes ran more to $35,000 commodes during the depths of the Great Recession[10], can rest easy. 
The Wall Street wrestler[11] likely owns some stock in World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE:WWE[12]), which 
jumped 3.03% on a broker boost[13].
Today in economics, consensus calls for a falloff in factory orders for July and August's Institute for Supply 
Management non-manufacturing index, each out at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. On the quarterly earnings front, Conn's 
(NASDAQ:CONN[14]), 
Finisar 
(NASDAQ:FNSR[15]), 
Quiksilver 
(NYSE:ZQK[16]), 
Smith 
Wesson 
(NASDAQ:SWHC[17]), and VeriFone (NYSE:PAY[18]) are all expected to release results.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (NYSE:BBVA[19]): The Bilbao-based bank is now Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse.
Endeavour Silver (NYSE:EXK[20]): BMO Capital Markets moves the commodity company to Market Perform from 
Underperform.
Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR[21]): Jefferies juices the industrial Real Estate Investment Trust to Buy from Hold.
Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN[22]): The online daily deals outfit is showing strength in today's pre-market trading 
after getting upgraded to Overweight from Equal-Weight at Morgan Stanley.
Stock Upgrades: Groupon Is Your Deal of the Day
HSN, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSNI[23]): Citigroup hoists the owner of Home Shopping Network to Buy from Neutral.
InterContinental Hotels (NYSE:IHG[24]): A UBS increase from Buy to Neutral is sending the stock up overseas this 
morning. The recent precipitous share price decline provides compelling value, in the bank's estimation.
Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX[25]): The building materials stock is lifted by both DA Davidson (Buy from Neutral, 
with the target taken to $20 from $18) and Deutsche Bank (Buy from Hold.) An accretive acquisition of Ainsworth 
Lumber is seen as a catalyst, and shares are surging ahead of the opening bell.
Marks Spencer (OTCMKTS:MAKSY): The iconic British retailer is rising in London trading today after being boosted 
to Overweight from Neutral by HSBC Securities.
Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC[26]): Lazard upgrades the advertising giant to Buy from Neutral.
RRSat Global Communications (NASDAQ:RRST[27]): Shares are raised to Outperform from Perform with a $10 
price objective at Oppenheimer, which cites this week's acquisition of European content management among its 
favorable factors.

Timmins Gold (NYSEMKT:TGD): BMO Capital takes the small cap company to Outperform from Market Perform.
Transocean (NYSE:RIG[29]): Credit Suisse takes the oil services outfit to Outperform from Neutral.
Universal Forest (NASDAQ:UFPI[30]): Shares are now Buy from Neutral at DA Davidson, which notes that its 
exposure to residential construction is under 20% of total revenues.

Sep 04, 2013 (Minyanville:http://www.minyanville.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Stocks started September with gains, although these were pared as the session wore on as a looming line in the 
sand[1] made for anything but a day at the beach. Still, the Dow (INDEXDJX:.DJI[2]) did start what has historically 
been a scary month in the green, with equities inspired by the Elop[3] and Elon show. This as a rejuvenated[4] 
Nokia (NYSE:NOK[5]) jumped 31.28% to top the NYSE and Mr. Musk saw his Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA[6]) hit 
an all-time high to take its 12-month increase to 492.36%.
Among standout stocks, Mr. Coffee owner Jarden Corp. (JAH) gained 10.43%. The company will forever be 
associated with an iconic New York Yankee[7]. Yet the caffeinated nectar of the gods was equally good to a Met[8], 
with David Einhorn's long-shorted Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR[9]) gapping down 1.33% on 
a ratings reduction[10].
Today in economic data, the Federal Reserve's beige book detailing regional financial conditions in a dozen 
districts is released at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. On the quarterly earnings front, Ciena Corporation (NASDAQ:CIEN[11]), 
Dollar General (NYSE:DG[12]), FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL[13]), Navistar International (NYSE:NAV[14]), and 
SAIC, Inc. (NYSE:SAI[15]) are all due to report results.
Akzo Nobel (OTCMKTS:AKZOY[16]): Macquarie moves the paints and coatings company to Neutral from 
Outperform.
Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP[17]): Barclays cuts the company to Equal-Weight from Overweight.
Beam Inc. (NYSE:BEAM[18]): The spirits maker gets downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus amid valuation issues.
Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR[19]): The technical software stock is taken to Hold from Buy with 
Wunderlich, whose price objective is $96. Consensus earnings estimates which forecast 40% pro forma EPS 
(earnings per share) growth are seen as overly optimistic.
Hospitals/Long-Term Care: Kindred Healthcare (NYSE:KND[20]) and Select Medical (NYSE:SEM[21]) are each cut 
to Underperform from Market Perform with Wells Fargo.
Stock Downgrades: Ryanair Is About to Crash
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT[22]): Morgan Stanley moves the stock, yesterday's poorest Dow (INDEXDJX:.DJI) 
performer, to Equal-Weight from Overweight. Its $7.2 billion deal with Nokia Corporation (NYSE:NOK) increases 
expenditure and execution risks, the analyst wrote in a note. Shares are trading lower this morning as a result.
Nokia (NYSE:NOK): The telecom name is now Hold from Buy at Argus after yesterday's 31.28% jump. (Note that 
shares separately scored two upgrades today.)
Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY[23]): The budget British airline, tumbling about 12% today after issuing a full-
year profit warning, is now Neutral from Buy at UBS.
Vivus, Inc. (NASDAQ:VVUS[24]): Lazard slashes the drug stock to Sell from Neutral.

 Europe's STOXX 600 equity index is down 0.5% in early PM trade, extending yesterday's decline and further 
eroding the strong rally that was seen on Monday. Mixed European data, a profit warning from Ryanair (Europe's 
biggest discount airline), and the Syria situation collectively made for a sour AM session. Bigger picture, the STOXX 
is about at the mid-way point of the range seen over the last two weeks. The index has been trending lower, in a 
choppy wave patter, since the Aug-13 trend peak, which had fallen short of the major trend peak seen in May. The 
price action reflects the market's consideration about the impact of the expected unwinding of stimulus policy 
settings in the U.S. and, eventually, elsewhere, alongside geopolitical uncertainties.

Aer Lingus In Breach Of Advertising Law, As It Misleads Irish Consumers
Aer Lingus In Breach Of Advertising Law, As It Misleads Irish Consumers

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair today (2 Sept) accused Aer Lingus of misleading Irish 
consumers, and being in breach of EU advertising law by quoting seat sale fares in Ireland which exclude Aer 
Lingus' non-optional €7 admin fee. This means that Aer Lingus' sale fares to Britain 'from €27.99' should include a 
non-optional €7 admin fee and be advertised at €34.99 and Aer Lingus' sale fares to Europe 'from €39.99' in fact 
start at a lowest inclusive fare of €46.99.
Aer Lingus's failure to include these unavoidable admin fees and its misleading advertising in Ireland is not mirrored 
in its UK advertising. In the UK Aer Lingus' lowest sale fares (on exactly the same routes) include a £7 admin fee, 
as Aer Lingus is required to under EU UK OFT rules. Accordingly Aer Lingus' lowest fare to Ireland from Britain 
start 'from £29.99' and to Europe 'from £49.99'.
Aer Lingus are clearly in breach of these EU NCA regulations by advertising sale fares in Ireland which are not in 
fact available because they exclude this unavoidable €7 admin fee. Aer Lingus are therefore in breach of the 
advertising code and are misleading Irish consumers.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'This is a blatant case of misleading advertising. On the one hand Aer Lingus advertise 'admin fee inclusive' sale 
fares to their customers in the UK, but here in Ireland they are advertising sale fares which exclude this non-
optional €7 admin fee. Aer Lingus are therefore engaged in misleading advertising.
'Perhaps it's time the National Consumer Agency of Ireland did something useful for once and required Aer Lingus 
to comply with EU regulations and include their unavoidable admin fees in their advertising, as well as requiring Aer 
Lingus to refund these air fares to pax who were duped into booking them by Aer Lingus' false advertising. 
'Regardless of whether Aer Lingus' advertised sales fares include this admin fee or exclude it, they are still more 
than double Ryanair's autumn seat sale prices which start to Britain from €14.99 and to Europe from €19.99.
'Our message to consumers is simple. Don't waste time with Aer Lingus' high fares (or their more frequently 
delayed flights). Book Ryanair for the lowest fares and the most on-time flights.'

 'Hays Travel, nobody offers you more, ooo-wee-ooo.' Any North Easterners who regularly listen to the radio will 
know the jolly Beach Boys-esque tinkle of the Hays Travel jingle. Founder and director, John Hays says it was the 
best bit of marketing he has ever done.
 Since issuing metro radio with the brief for 30 seconds of sunshine pop some twenty odd years ago, the 
Sunderland-based travel agent has become a stalwart of the regional high street and is synonymous with suntans 
and sandals for North East holidaymakers.
 John founded the firm in 1980, and grew it from a one-shop operation to an internationally renowned operator.
 'In the morning I stand in the shower and think about what needs to be done that day. Once I get into work, the day 
very quickly looks nothing like what I had planned,' laughs John. The entrepreneur says no two days are alike in the 
'fast moving' travel industry.
 In the face of cheap flights and google-able holiday bookings, Hays has forged a remarkably strong path as a 
traditional high street travel agent.
 John's style is to get out and about amongst the Hays shops and offices, and admits to only being at his only desk 
a third of the time.
 He says: 'I tend to wander round people's desks and chat to them as I go. I get a much better feel for what's going 
on, what moral is like, and how we can progress the business.'
 Hays reported sales of £520m in 2012, and climbing, monthly like-for-like sales. The firm have managed this in 
spite of a dramatically changing industry landscape; one which has left many travel agents for dust.
 'The likes of easyJet and Ryanair have rapidly shot up the tables to become some of Europe's biggest airlines and 
the vast majority of their flights are booked online, as opposed to walking into a shop or over the telephone.
 'We've got a multi-channel approach. However clients want to interact, we try to facilitate that. That means shops, 
telephone and online. We have a sizeable database of customers and it's really quite interesting when you analyse 
the data - the same client will often book with us via different channels depending on what they're doing.
 'If someone is booking a city break weekend they might do it online, or if they're going to Spain for a week they 
might ring a call centre. When it comes to a big wedding anniversary or an expensive cruise they often want to 
come in to a shop and discussion it face-to-face.'
 The firm also employ a number of homeworkers who develop customer networks in their own neighbourhoods and 
visit people in their homes to offer a 'concierge' type service.
 Hays' model is enduring. In much the same way it has done for years, the firm acts as an agent for other tour 
operators, including the likes of Thomson and Thomas Cook.
Where does North East travel boss John Hays go on holiday?
 In addition the brand have established their own 'bed bank' - a platform designed to give clients accommodation 
only at competitive prices. John has also introduced money-spinners such as Hays Transfers Ltd
 Despite a decline in the high street, Hays shop fronts are still a fixture of North East shopping parades.
 'We've still got our 43 shops in the North East and have continued to trade well. In fact, I just signed the lease for a 
new shop in Hexham recently,' John adds, 'there's not many gaps left for us on the map. On a general level, I am 
concerned about how sad some of the high streets in the North East look.'
 And it isn't just the high street that Hays have had to contend with. John was speaking at an industry conference in 
the Costa del Sol when the news of Thomas Cook's financial troubles came to light, sparking a period of uncertainty 
for the sector.
 John explained: 'Thomas Cook were probably within hours of going bust. Instead of giving a keynote as I would 
have done I did a joint talk with the firm's relationship manager at the conference. We don't want a big iconic brand 
like Thomas Cook to go out of business - it would be bad for absolutely everybody in the industry - so we supported 
them really strongly.
 'The new chief executive, Harriet Green, has done an excellent turnaround. Their brand did take a hit for a few 
months after being in the news for all the wrong reasons.'
 It's against this uncertain backdrop that Hays have continued unscathed and with the backing of a strong balance 
sheet, John says the firm is now on the acquisition trail. Hays have made a gradual move into the tour operator 
space, and this is another area John has earmarked for growth.
 North Easterners are currently enamoured with the likes of New York and Las Vegas, which John describes as 
'perennial favourites,' and Far East Asia has started to occupy more Hays brochures as holiday makers become 
more adventurous.
 John adds: 'Talk about changes over the last ten years - who would have thought we'd be selling holidays to 
Cambodia and Vietnam. It's these long haul places that are going to bring us growth.'
 So where does the boss escape to on his summer holiday? John suggests he rarely goes to the same place twice, 
but one place holds a particular fascination for him.
 He explains: 'There's a little island in the Maldives called Makunudu and its certainly not five star, in fact, it might be 
about no-star. You get there by speed boat, once you've changed into your shorts at the airport of course. Even 
when you're 100 yards away, you can hardly anything on the horizon, other than a few little bungalows tucked 
under the palm trees. No swimming pool or tv, its just a beautiful lagoon. I wear bare feet for the whole week, it's 
fantastic. You need to be there with someone you get on with, because there's not much to do.'

 Low-cost airline Wizz Air has been helping Ciampino airport transfers, with its influx of passengers from Bucharest.
New York, NY -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 08/30/2013 -- An influx of passengers travelling on Wizz Airlineaposs low-cost 
flights between Italy and Romania has been helping Ciampino airport transfers[2] grow in volume ever since the 
airline began operating. Overall, it is estimated that around one million passengers will have travelled on the 
airlineaposs routes from Bucharest to London and Ciampino at this stage.
The airline does, of course, operate other flights to various destinations, but the Rome Ciampino and London Luton 
routes are by far the most popular. A large portion of their appeal is the pricing, with tickets starting as low as RON 
129, which amounts to around EUR 29. As a result, Romanians have flocked to Italy and England, and are helping 
boost the traffic for both airports.
Also as a result of their low-cost flights, Wizz Air has managed to establish itself as the largest low-cost airline in 
Eastern and Central Europe, beating out well-established names such as Ryanair and Easyjet in that portion of the 
world. Their fleet is currently made up of 44 Airbus A320 planes, which fly to 94 destinations in 34 countries. 
Altogether, the airline operates from 17 bases, employing about 1600 people.
Another reason for the airlineaposs success may have been the Romanian publicaposs eagerness to travel abroad, 
after years of living in repression due to a dictatorship. Last year, around 7.45 million Romanians used one of the 
countryaposs airports, an increase of 1.3 percent in relation to 2011. In the first quarter of 2013, Wizz Air alone has 
served about 13.5 million passengers! With regards to destinations, the overwhelming majority of travellers from the 
country head to the European Union (84%). Germany seems to be a popular destination, with 68% of passengers 
using the Otopeni airport in 2012 were heading for locations around the Schengen area. As noted, Ciampino and 
London also seem to be very popular among the Romanian people.

 The Boeing Company (BA[1]) secured an order from Canada's WestJet Airlines yesterday for the supply of 65 new 
aircraft. The delivery of the planes is expected to commence in Sep 2017 with production anticipated to start in 
2015. The order is for the company's new line of 737 aircraft and is worth $6.3 billion at current list prices.
 Boeing will sell 40 737 MAX 8s and 25 737 MAX 7s. The line of 737 MAX is designed to suit all the requirements of 
an advanced passenger carrier including efficiency, reliability and passenger amenities. The final purchase deal is 
set to be concluded by Sep 2013.
 The MAX 8 has the capacity to carry 162 to 175 passengers, while the MAX 7 has room for 126 to 140 
passengers. The narrow body 737 MAX is expected to rival Airbus' A320neo carriers. The latest incarnation of 
Boeing's 737 MAX is powered by CFM International LEAP-1B engines which offer fuel cost savings of 13% from 
previous models.
 WestJet has also revised its existing order of 15 Next-Generation 737 aircraft to 737 MAX aircraft due between 
Dec 2014 and 2018. The current addition will bring Boeing's total deliveries to WestJet to 92.
 Deliveries of Boeing's 737 will ramp up in 2013 backed by rising airline activities in Asia, particularly in the Middle 
East. The company picked up sizeable international contracts from the Paris Air Show this year. The most notable 
contract in Paris came from Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[2]) for the supply of 175 next generation 737-800 
airplanes for $15.6 billion.
 Boeing's technologically advanced commercial aircraft is in demand in the domestic as well as international 
markets. This will ensure a stable future earnings stream for Boeing's Commercial Airplane Division. Commercial 
aircraft production for top manufacturers is forecast to range between 27,350 and 34,000 in the next 20 years, 
which is a good sign for the company.
 However, Boeing's defense opportunities might be hurt by budget sequestration in the U.S. Currently, Boeing 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 UKCC IGNORES 7 YEARS OF EVIDENCE AND INVENTS 'CONCERNS' IN DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO 
JUSTIFY PREDETERMINED RULING
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (28 Aug) confirmed that it will appeal the UK 
Competition Commission (UKCC) final report which wrongly found that Ryanair, through its 7 year old minority 
(29.8%) shareholding in Aer Lingus, 'had led or may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition 
between the airlines on routes between Great Britain and Ireland'.
 This baseless claim is manifestly disproven by 7 years of evidence and by the European Commission's recent (Feb 
2013) ruling that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has 'intensified' since 2007. 
Under EU law, the UKCC has a duty of sincere cooperation with the EU, and cannot contradict or reach different 
conclusions to the European Commission's findings. Inexplicably, today's report by the UKCC infringes this legal 
duty by ignoring and contradicting the recent findings of the European Commission that:
'Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete on a greater number of routes compared to the 2007 Decision', 'there is 
significant competitive interaction between the Parties', and 'evidence collected by the Commission in the market 
investigation has also confirmed that the competitive relationship between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has at least 
persisted, if not increased, since 2007'.
In addition, the UKCC has inexplicably dismissed Ryanair's unprecedented remedies package which 
comprehensively addressed the UKCC's three invented 'concerns'. For example, the UKCC rejected Ryanair's offer 
to unconditionally sell its minority stake to any other airline that makes a bid for Aer Lingus and obtains acceptances 
from 50.1% of Aer Lingus' shareholders. Ryanair also offered to support Aer Lingus' rights issues and any disposal 
of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots, but these simple and effective remedies were also rejected by the UKCC.
The UKCC's manifestly unjust ruling demonstrates that it did not conduct any fair investigation and that it has now 
merely announced what was its pre-determined conclusion. Ryanair will appeal the UKCC's unlawful ruling to the 
UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. In any event, until the completion of Ryanair's appeal to the EU courts against the 
Ryanair Will Appeal UKCC Report On 7 Year Old Aer Lingus Minority Stake
European Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision, the CC cannot lawfully impose any remedies on 
Ryanair.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'This report by the UKCC is bizarre and manifestly wrong but also entirely expected. From the first meeting with the 
UKCC it has been clear to us that Simon Polito's and Roger Davis' minds had been made up in advance and no 
truth or evidence was going to get in the way of their story. This prejudicial approach to an Irish airline is very 
disturbing, coming from an English government body that regards itself a model competition authority.
Polito's and Davis' ignoring of evidence, their conduct of a manifestly unfair investigation, their omission of all the 
substantial body of evidence that conclusively disproves their case, and their rejection of Ryanair's unprecedented 
undertakings (which patently address their three invented future concerns), all in a misguided pursuit of their pre-
determined conclusion, demonstrate that this process was not a competition investigation but merely a corrupt and 
politically biased charade. 
While Ryanair is one of the UK's largest airlines, Aer Lingus has a tiny presence in the UK, serving just 6 routes to 
the Republic of Ireland, a traffic base that has declined over the past 3 years and now accounts for less than 1% of 
all UK air traffic. This case, involving two Irish airlines where one (Aer Lingus) accounts for less than 1% of the UK's 
total air traffic and concerns very few UK consumers, is yet another enormous waste of UK taxpayer resources from 
a body which took no action whatsoever when the two main UK airlines (BA and bmi) merged. It would appear to be 
a case of one rule for the UK airlines but an invented set of rules for two Irish airlines.
In February 2013 the European Commission found that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has 
'intensified' since 2007. The UKCC's failure to accept this finding is a breach of its legal duty of sincere cooperation 
between the UK and the EU competition authorities and will form the basis for Ryanair's appeal against this bizarre 
and manifestly unsound ruling, which our lawyers will lodge with the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the coming 
weeks.'

 Budget airline Ryanair has launched a scathing attack on the Competition Commission (CC) following a ruling that 
it must sell its stake in Aer Lingus.
 The Irish carrier is required to divest its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus Group plc amid concerns that it impeded Aer 
Lingus in its commercial strategy and prevented the airline being acquired.
 A statement from the CC said it recognised a 'tension' between Ryanair's position as a competitor and its position 
as Aer Lingus's largest shareholder, and it had an interest in weakening its competitor.
 Ryanair's outspoken boss, Michael O'Leary, called the move 'bizarre and manifestly wrong.'
 He accused the CC of taking a prejudicial approach to the case and branded the investigation a 'corrupt and 
politically biased charade.'
 Ryanair say the ruling goes against findings by the European Commission in February that competition between 
the two airlines has intensified, and suggest that in seven years of owning the stake there had been no issues.
 The CC have dismissed Ryanair's package of remedies, which included an unconditional sale of the stake to any 
airline that makes a successful bid for Aer Lingus and support for Aer Lingus' rights issues and any disposal of Aer 
Lingus' Heathrow slots.
 Mr O'Leary said: "This report by the UKCC is bizarre and manifestly wrong but also entirely expected. From the 
first meeting with the UKCC it has been clear to us that Simon Polito's and Roger Davis' minds had been made up 
in advance and no truth or evidence was going to get in the way of their story. This prejudicial approach to an Irish

undertakings (which patently address their three invented future concerns), all in a misguided pursuit of their pre-
determined conclusion, demonstrate that this process was not a competition investigation but merely a corrupt and 
politically biased charade."
 Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "Today's final report by the UK Competition Commission confirms 
that the minority shareholding in Aer Lingus held by our closest competitor, is anti-competitive and contrary to the 
interests of the approximately 14 million passengers who fly on routes between the island of Ireland and Great 
Britain. The Competition Commission should be commended on its thorough investigation and we look forward to 
the implementation of its findings.
O'Leary calls in lawyers over "corrupt charade" competition rulings
 "It was unacceptable that our principal competitor was allowed to remain on our share register with a shareholding 
of 29.82% and interfere with our business despite the European Commission blocking both Ryanair's first hostile 
takeover attempt six years ago and its most recent hostile takeover attempt earlier this year."

 AirAsia Japan President Tomonori Ishii unveils its new brand name 'Vanilla Air' during a press conference in Tokyo 
on August 20, 2013
 What's in an airline name? You may have heard this week that AirAsia's Japanese arm, now wholly owned by 
ANA, rebranded itself as Vanilla -- selected from a field of 200 possible titles -- because, as the airline's president 
explained, "everyone likes vanilla." Maybe, but vanilla to many of us means bland and boring -- who'd want to fly 
plane vanilla? Still, it's not the worst airline name ever -- some truly cringe-worthy monikers have plied the skies:
 Hooters Air: Based in Myrtle Beach, this offshoot of the redneck restaurant chain flew for three years--serving 15 
cities at its peak--before folding in 2006. Yes, it featured the same scantily clad women as the eateries do, only they 
were just there for show; a second crew of trained flight attendants worked each flight.
 Lord's Airline: This one could have used some help from above. The airline, which was trying to get rights to fly 
from Florida to the Holy Land, never got off the ground.
Happy Air: Based in Thailand, this tiny turbroprop operator ran into some unhappy times a few years ago; but it's 
still in business.
 Wizz Air: This Hungarian-based discounter styles itself the Ryanair of Eastern Europe--and while its name is the 
butt of jokes in some quarters, its low fares and frequent flights out of London's Luton have put it on the map.
 Song Ted: The duo of discount airlines-within-an airline--launched by Delta and United, respectively to fight back at 
JetBlue--hit a sour note when the concept failed to catch fire, despite touches like Song's apple martinis and Kate 
Spade uniforms (and teddy bears on Ted.) Rising costs and a muddled message sent both Song and Ted to the 
airline dustbin a few years after they debuted. 
 Bingo Airways: The Polish line started flying charters last year to Mediterranean destinations like Greece, Turkey, 
and Israel (not clear whether bingo is part of the inflight entertainment).
Robin Hood Aviation: This oddly named upstart was based in Austria and flew a tiny fleet of turboprops for just a 
few years before fading into history.
 Gandalf Airlines: Gandalf was a short-lived regional airline based in Italy. It flew to various cities on the continent 
with a mix of ten prop planes and small jets, but by 2003 it had run out of gas. Clearly it didn't hang around long 
enough to get a boost from Lord of the Rings.

 Ryanair, the ultra-low-fare carrier based in Ireland, wants you to know that it is cheap but not so cheap that it'll stiff 
you on your pocket change.
 The airline famous for squeezing fees from passengers took some heat recently from British tabloids that 
suggested Ryanair's flight attendants were not returning change to passengers after sales on board.
 The tabloids hinted that the penny-pinching airline was keeping the change to increase airline revenues.
 "Nonsense," responded Robin Kiely, a spokesman for Ryanair. "Utter nonsense."
 The stories, he said, were based on a training manual that instructed Ryanair flight attendants who are selling on-
board food and drinks what to do when they run out of change. The manual tells flight attendants to suggest that 
passengers buy extra items to eliminate the need for change, Kiely said.
 But the manual, produced by a third party, has been revised.
 "Our policy is to give change right back," he said.

The Pros And Cons Of Social Media In Small Business
The Pros And Cons Of Social Media In Small Business

 They say anything worth doing is worth doing well. Nowhere is this more true than in the world of social media 
marketing. In January 2012, McDonald's found out firsthand[1] how the power of social media can turn people 
against even the most beloved companies. Encouraging Twitter users to use the hashtag #McDStories and share 
their positive experiences at the Golden Arches, the company was surprised when people began using the tag to 
share horror stories instead.
 Your small business may not have the same social media aspirations as McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it is 
any less relevant. Before you jump onto Facebook, however, here's a look at the pros and cons of social media in 
small business.
Pro - Reach Out and Touch Someone
In the 1980s, ATT encouraged their customers to reach out and touch someone with their phone service. Today 
you don't even need a phone. With social media, you can reach a highly diverse demographic just by posting 
messages. Best of all? It can be done for free.
Con - A Constantly Changing World
The Internet of today barely resembles the Internet of 10 years ago. As innovations come at us at an ever-
increasing rate, it's going to be difficult for even the biggest, most forward-thinking companies to keep up. For a 
small business that sees social media as a chore rather than an opportunity, keeping up with the trends may seem 
impossible.
Pro - Direct Customer Interaction
Many small business owners scoff when told of the power of social media. 'Why would anyone want to like my 
company on Facebook?' When done right, however, people enjoy the chance to interact with the companies they 
use. It gives them the opportunity to express direct feedback, be it positive or negative. If you listen to your 
customer's negative feedback and respond appropriately, it could really improve your business.
Con - Everything's Out in the Open
In 2012, budget airline Ryanair discovered how quickly the social media tide can turn against your company. After 
a customer complaint went viral[2], the company found itself unwilling to respond. The company barely had a social 
media presence at the time, proving that you don't need to put yourself out there to receive criticism. At least if you 
have an official Facebook page, you have a level of control over the discourse, which Ryanair did not.
Pro - Brand Messaging
Desmond Wong at Hubspot recently featured[3] several companies that maintained a consistent brand image 
across social media outlets. Whether you use Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest or all of the above, it's important to 
The Pros And Cons Of Social Media In Small Business
maintain that consistency. In a world where your customers are constantly being advertised to, that kind of digital 
branding increases awareness and encourages loyalty.
Con - Some Maintenance Required
You can't expect to simply start a Twitter account or a Facebook page and wait for customers to find you. A good 
social media marketing campaign should be well-tended. Representatives from your company should be asking and 
answering questions, holding contests and making the most of the interaction. If you don't have the time to do all of 
this, social media may not be of value to your company.
Pro - Visual Communication
Being on social media isn't just about words and hashtags. Many companies fail to realize how customizable their 
Facebook accounts are, for instance. By initiating visual communication strategies that are visually appealing, using 
pictures and animation and putting your logo out in front of people, you create recognition and accomplish the basic 
goal of marketing: get customers interested.
Overall
According to a recent article in Forbes[4], 78 percent of salespeople who used social media in their approach were 
able to outsell those who didn't. This number, in and of itself, is enough to outweigh almost any 'con' there could be. 
There are downsides to putting your small business on the social media map, but none of them are great enough to 
erase the biggest pro: To remain relevant in 2013 and beyond, social media marketing is an absolute necessity. 
Whether or not you do it well is up to you.

 Ryanair has fired a pilot who contributed to a British television documentary that raised fears over its fuel policy, 
the Irish no-frills airline has announced.

2013 at Le Bourget airport, Paris. Ryanair has fired a pilot who contributed to a British television documentary that 
raised fears over its fuel policy, the Irish no-frills airline has announced.
 Ryanair added in a statement that it had instructed its lawyers to issue legal proceedings against the pilot, John 
Goss, who featured in Channel 4′s Dispatches programme that was broadcast earlier in the week.
 'Since Mr Goss's contribution to the C4 Dispatches programme is contradicted by his prior written confirmations to 
Ryanair… that he has 'no concerns' about Ryanair's safety, the airline has today terminated Mr Goss's employment 
with immediate effect,' Ryanair said in a statement dated Wednesday.
 A Ryanair spokesman added: 'We look forward to correcting Mr Goss's defamatory claims in court in due course, 
but will not be commenting further on this issue which is now the subject of legal proceedings.'
 The Dispatches programme highlighted three occasions on which the airline's pilots had called in emergency alerts 
because they were low on fuel.
 The programme quoted members of the Ryanair Pilot Group, which later issued a statement defending the 
testimonies and slamming the airline's 'unprecedented' safety reporting procedures.
 Ryanair maintained that bad weather was the cause of the incidents and that its aircraft fully complied with EU 
regulation, and also charged that the group was in fact not made up of its pilots but was a front for unions not 
represented at the airline.

            http://www.flickr.com/photos/19535828@N00/2364346080[1]During the period of financial crisis traveling is 
not easy and that is not good for many countries in which the tourism sector, is one of the most important. People 
still want to travel but are more reluctant to do so because of the current crisis hitting Europe in general and more 
particularly countries like Portugal, Italy and of course Spain. Of course this crisis causes problems to all over the 
world or it will in the near future.
 Due to the current situation there have been many questions tourists have made, such as whether to save rather 
than traveling or is it better not to travel at all as this usually involves excessive spending on many occasions.
 There are many deals on offer in travel agencies and wrapped packages made to consume, but this is not to 
everyone's liking, since more and more tourists like to choose what type of accommodation, flights, dates or days 
will travel. So there have been many alternatives to travel in order to save more. One could point out a way to move 
between neighboring countries or within the same country, for those who like to travel by car but not wishing to 
have the option to share car. This medium is unknown for many but very effective and very safe also, you pay a 
price per trip, depending on the length of it and there is no concern.
 For trips where the destination is not so close, we all know the famous company Ryanair which is cheap and with a 
multitude of destinations. Make you sure you have an international travel insurance[2] that covers all your needs 
and pocket. What is left to do is choosing accommodation and for that there are many deals if you are looking for an 
alternative to standard hotels and usually the price does not reference quality. To find a property to the desired 
extent you can do your research online where you can find different types of accommodation such as a room in a 
shared flat, an apartment or an entire house, as well as Bed and Breakfast, hotel-like accommodation with basic 
facilities for sleeping and breakfast.
 With all the alternative media that exist today is hard to resist making a vacation or a trip without having to spend a 
large portion of the payroll. Thanks to these new ideas materialized in companies, we can save enjoying the 
pleasure of traveling.

Ryanair fires senior pilot for questioning airline's safety on TV

 DUBLIN, IRELAND (BNO NEWS) -- Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has fired one of its longest-serving pilots after he 
appeared on British television and questioned the airline's safety record, alleging aircraft frequently fly with the 
minimum of fuel and that cockpit voice recordings have disappeared after serious incidents.
The airline, the second largest in Europe with 79.3 million passengers last year, said Thursday it had instructed its 
lawyers to issue legal proceedings against senior pilot John Goss following his appearance on the Channel 4 
program "Dispatches," which questioned Ryanair's safety record.
"Ryanair's safety has been independently confirmed as being 'on par with the safest airlines in Europe.' It is 
delivered on a daily basis by over 9,000 outstanding aviation professionals whose commitment to safety is 
absolute," an airline spokesman said, describing Goss' claims as "defamatory."
In the interview, Goss claimed Ryanair aircraft have frequently flown with the minimum allowed amount of fuel and 
that he had received a critical letter for using 'too much fuel.' He also said many pilots did not have confidence in 
the confidential safety reporting systems of the Irish authorities.
Ryanair said the claims by Goss are contradicted by his prior written confirmations on July 10 and earlier this week 
that he had "no concerns" about the airline's safety. As a result, Ryanair terminated the pilot's employment on 
Wednesday with immediate effect, the spokesman said.
"We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just 3 weeks after he confirmed in 
writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety and no reason to make any confidential safety report to either 
the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) or Ryanair," he explained.
The Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG), an association which campaigns for official union representation of flight crews and 
which is advising Goss, strongly condemned the airline for its decision to fire the pilot. Goss, who worked for 
Ryanair for more than 26 years as both a captain and Flight Safety Officer, was recently elected as a member of the 
RPG's Interim Council.
Ryanair fires senior pilot for questioning airline's safety on TV
"It is simply extraordinary that the immediate reaction of Ryanair to safety issues brought to their attention is to deny 
the existence of any problems and to effectively shoot the messenger," said RPG Chairman Evert van Zwol. "Safety 
experts are agreed that a sound safety culture is based on pilots having faith in a non-punitive approach and 
dealing directly and transparently with all concerns raised."
Van Zwol added: "Dismissing John further calls into question the trustworthiness and truthfulness of Ryanair 
management when it comes to the traditional industry norm of free discussion of safety issues in the public domain. 
Their chosen approach is apparently to suppress discussion, on grounds that have never been clarified."
Goss did not comment after being fired on Wednesday, but Van Zwol said the pilot's first priority is to seek legal 
advice on his options. "This is a particularly difficult time for John and his family. We will provide every support 
possible to enable John to deal with this challenging situation," he said.

 Ireland's Ryanair has sacked one of its senior pilots after he questioned the airline's safety standards in a television 
interview. The carrier maintained its safety record was on a par with European rivals. Low-budget Ryanair 
announced Thursday it had dismissed veteran pilot John Goss for what it called "defamatory contributions" in a 
British Channel 4 documentary about the carrier's safety culture.
 In that program, Goss said he'd received a critical letter for using too much back-up fuel. He also claimed many 
fellow pilots working for Ryanair did not have confidence in the safety reporting systems in place.
 Ryanair rejected accusations from pilots that it encouraged crew to carry less back-up fuel and that disciplinary 
threats were used to keep employees from reporting safety issues.
 Safety standards questioned
 Management claimed it had two confidential safety reporting systems, which alongside other instruments, were on 
a par with the safest airlines in Europe.
 "We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just three weeks after he 
confirmed in writing that he had no concerns with safety," the company said in a statement, while it was preparing 
legal action against John Goss.
 Goss himself said he would not make any public comment on his dismissal until he received further legal advice.
 French Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier said he would seek more information about Ryanair's treatment of its 
pilots. He added he was "determined to obtain the necessary clarifications on the veracity of the allegations that 
pilots were discouraged from reporting incidents."

 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (13 Aug) welcomed the latest quarterly performance 
data from NATS (the UK's Air Navigation Service Provider) which confirmed Ryanair's outstanding performance on 
key safety measures.
Ryanair was once again amongst the best performing airlines for minimising level busts, reducing callsign confusion 
incidents and compliance with ATC procedures (as set out below).
Level busts: (when aircraft fail to fly at the level cleared to)
Callsign confusion events: (leading to recognition errors between pilots ATC)
Failure to follow ATC procedure events: (aircraft not following ATC procedures)
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'These latest NATS performance statistics confirm that Ryanair is one of the most safety-compliant airlines 
operating in UK airspace. Ryanair's compliance with minimising level busts, reducing callsign confusion events and 
adherence to ATC procedures is industry-leading. These independent statistics underline Ryanair's excellent 
operating procedures, our outstanding 29-year safety record and our relentless commitment to safety.'

 Ryanair, the Ireland-based budget airline known for extreme cost-cutting, stands accused of cutting corners on 
something else: safety measures.
 That's if the Ryanair Pilot Group[1], a group of anonymous pilots seeking to unionize, are to be believed. According 
to a survey of more than 1,000 captains and first officers working for the airline, 94 percent would like to see a 
formal inquiry into the impact of Ryanair's policies and how they impact safety.
 The survey further determined 89 percent of the employees believed Ryanair lacked an open and transparent 
safety culture[2], and more than 65 percent would not be comfortable flagging problems via the company's internal 
system, Reuters reports.
 RPG's interim council chairman, Evert van Zwol, told Financial Times the group had a "strong suspicion" Ryanair's 
policies were negatively affecting safety[3], though they have no proof this is actually the case, thus justifying a 
regulatory inquiry[4].
 Ryanair has since labeled the allegations made by RPG "false and defamatory," noting the airline's "outstanding 29 
year safety record." The company further retorts[5] that RPG is no more than "a PR front for the European Cockpit 
Association which is the club of pilots unions of Ryanair's EU airline competitors."
 An extensive set of documents published on the airline's website Monday include one from the Irish Aviation 
Authority, dated September 2012, which states Ryanair has safety standards "on a par with"[6] other European 
airlines.

'As one of the 10% of the world's population blessed with a strong left-hand, I know all about the difficulties faced by 
fellow lefties. To celebrate World Left Handers' Day tomorrow, Ryanair is launching a 100,000 seat sale on over 
1,000 European routes at prices starting from just £19.99, for travel in September, October and November - which 
must be booked using left hands only.
Right-handers can also avail of these fares, at no extra cost, provided they too use their left hands. These seats are 
only available until midnight (24:00hrs) Thursday (15 Aug) and are sure to be snapped up fast, so we urge 
passengers to book them on www.ryanair.com[3] - and not get left behind.'

Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1]
Ryanair, today (12 Aug) responded to the false claims made in the C4 Dispatches programme by issuing the 
following statement and publishing the full exchange of letters with C4 Dispatches as follows:
Ryanair rejected the false and defamatory claims made by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme which wrongly 
impugn and smear Ryanair's outstanding 29 year safety record based on nothing more than anonymous hearsay 
claims made by individuals whose identity was concealed, and/or by representatives of pilot unions of Ryanair's 
competitor airlines masquerading as a Non Ryanair Pilot Group.
Ryanair has today released on its website the entire exchange of correspondence with Channel 4 Dispatches which 
highlights the following facts:
1.The evidence provided by Ryanair and the Irish Aviation Authority conclusively disproves these false claims about 
Ryanair's fuel policy and/or Ryanair's outstanding safety record.
2.The programme relies upon hearsay claims by anonymous alleged Ryanair pilots, despite the fact that Ryanair 
offered legally binding guarantees to these individuals of no sanction if they made these claims on the record, solely 
so that Ryanair could publish details of their individual flight records, fuel records, sickness records and safety 
reports which would disprove their false claims.Despite these assurances, C4 Dispatches insisted on maintaining 
their anonymity because, Ryanair believes, these individuals know that their claims are false and unsupported by 
evidence.
3.Despite the evidence provided by Ryanair and the IAA disproving these fuel and safety claims, Dispatches have 
failed to address or report this evidence, preferring instead to publish these false claims in an unfair, unbalanced 
and inaccurate programme.
4.Channel 4 Dispatches have repeatedly refused Ryanair's offer of an unedited interview with CEO Michael 
O'Leary, in which he offered to address any claims raised by Dispatches and rubbish the false claims made by 
Ryanair Releases Channel 4 Dispatches Letters
these anonymous contributors.Dispatches would only interview Michael O'Leary if they could edit his answers, 
which was not fair or acceptable to Ryanair.
5.Ryanair provided Dispatches with a short statement (below) rejecting the false claims made by the programme, 
however Channel 4 Dispatches have refused to report this short statement in its unedited form.
6.Channel 4 Dispatches cannot be relied upon to fairly or accurately report on matters relating to Ryanair, having 
previously (in 2006) used actors to pose as sleeping Ryanair cabin crew to promote an earlier and equally 
inaccurate programme on Ryanair's safety.
7.The Irish Aviation Authority, which is the independent safety regulator for all Irish airlines has confirmed (attached) 
that Ryanair fully complies with EU fuel policies, including allowing all its pilots to take as much fuel as they wish 
to.Over 50% of all Ryanair pilots take extra fuel over and above the already planned Ryanair extra fuel on a daily 
basis.
8.The self styled Ryanair Pilot Group is a PR front for the European Cockpit Association which is the club of pilots 
unions of Ryanair's EU airline competitors.The Interim Council of this Non Ryanair Pilot Group (NRPG) comprises 
four pilots/union leaders who work for KLM, Aer Lingus, Air France and Southwest Airlines.These people have no 
insight, credibility or objectivity in commenting upon Ryanair's safety.The fifth member is a serving Ryanair Captain 
who has recently confirmed - in writing - that he has no concerns about Ryanair's safety.This trade union group has 
no credibility, it lacks any impartiality, and its fabricated survey which claims to be based upon replies from less 
than one third of Ryanair's over 3,000 serving pilots are a crude attempt to use baseless safety 'concerns' as a 
cover for its failed trade union agenda.
Finally, Ryanair's safety has recently been confirmed by the Irish Aviation Authority as being 'on a par with the 
safest airlines in Europe'. This is attested to by Ryanair's outstanding 29 year safety record.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 'Ryanair rejects these failed attempts by C4 Dispatches and/or European pilot trade unions to denigrate or smear 
Ryanair's outstanding 29 year safety record in an attempt to promote their 20 year failed campaign to obtain union 
recognition in Ryanair.Since the Channel 4 Dispatches programme (which previously used actors to promote 
equally false claims about Ryanair's cabin crew)has published these false anonymous hearsay claims, and the 
bogus results of an unreliable, fabricated survey prepared by the European pilot trade union club, Ryanair has 
instructed its lawyers to issue legal proceedings against Channel 4 Dispatches for defamation and Ryanair looks 
forward to this matter being resolved in the Courts and the safety of Ryanair's operations being thoroughly 
vindicated since the IAA has independently confirmed 'Ryanair is on a par with the safest airlines in Europe' and the 
C4 Dispatches programme has produced no shred of evidence to undermine this independent verification of 
Ryanair's outstanding safety.
 RYANAIR DISMISSES DISPATCHES FALSE CLAIMS
 Both Ryanair and the Irish safety regulator (IAA) have provided Dispatches with conclusive evidence which 
disproves the false claims made by anonymous contributors, which this programme broadcast while ignoring the 
evidence which proves them to be untrue.
 Despite offering legal protection to these anonymous claimants, they refuse to make their claims on the record, 
because they know these claims are false and will be disproven by an analysis of their rosters, flight and sickness 
records. Ryanair regrets that the pilot unions of our competitor airlines and a tiny number of individual 'pilots' are 
willing to make these false claims - only while hiding behind anonymity - as a way of promoting their failed efforts to 
unionise Ryanair's pilots.
 Both Ryanair and the IAA have confirmed that all Ryanair flights fully comply with the same EU fuel rules as all 
other EU airlines. All Ryanair flights are planned with extra fuel, over and above minimum EU requirements, and all 
Ryanair pilots are encouraged to take extra fuel should they so wish to. The IAA said 'We regularly review the fuel 
Ryanair Releases Channel 4 Dispatches Letters
policy of Ryanair as part of our regular surveillance programme and we have no concerns currently that any undue 
upload restrictions implied or otherwise exist.'
 Finally, Ryanair has an outstanding 29 year safety record. The Irish Aviation Authority recently confirmed that 
Ryanair's safety 'is on a par with the safest airlines in Europe'.

Ryanair Statement On So Called 'Pilots Survey'

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair today (12th August) dismissed inaccurate reports in a 
number of UK papers, including the Financial Times and the Daily Telegraph, which made references to a 'survey 
of Ryanair pilots' and comments attributed to an Evert Van Zwol, the self styled Chairman of the Ryanair Pilot 
Group's Interim Council.
Ryanair pointed out the Ryanair Pilot Group is in fact a Non Ryanair Pilot Group (NRPG), as it is a PR front for the 
European Cockpit Association, which is the group representing pilot trade unions of Ryanair's competitor airlines.
Ryanair also pointed out that the self proclaimed Chairman of this Non Ryanair Group 'Interim Council', Evert Van 
Zwol, is in fact a serving KLM pilot and recent President of the Dutch Pilot Union. Ryanair finds it strange that the 
Financial Times and others attribute quotes about Ryanair's safety to this individual without pointing out (in the 
interest of balance and accuracy) that he is not a Ryanair pilot, but is rather a KLM pilot and the recent President of 
the Dutch Pilot Trade Union.
Ryanair pointed out that this so called pilot survey was in fact fabricated by the European Cockpit Association 
(ECA) which is the pilot trade union club for Ryanair's competitor airlines. Another member of the NRPG Interim 
Council is a Ted Murphy, a lifelong Aer Lingus pilot, former Chairman of the Aer Lingus pilots union IALPA, and a 
two term President of IFALPA, the international pilots union.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'The Non Ryanair Pilot Group (NRPG )is quite clearly a PR front for pilot trade unions of Ryanair's competitor 
airlines. A so called 'survey' fabricated by these ECA pilot unions, which does not have access to or contact with the 
entire 3,000 plus pilots employed by Ryanair, lacks any independence, objectivity or reliability. It is another failed 
attempt by ECA pilot unions to use non-existent safety 'concerns' to advance their 25 year failed campaign to win 
union recognition in Ryanair.
'Both Ryanair and the Irish Aviation Authority operate confidential safety reporting systems which allow any Ryanair 
pilot with any legitimate safety concerns to report these in complete confidentiality - without any fear of reprisal - 
either through Ryanair's confidential system or the IAA's independent and confidential system.
Ryanair's outstanding 29 year safety record is a matter of rigorous oversight and fact based evidence. It is not 
something that can be voted on or subjected to anonymous or fabricated trade union surveys. It has been rigorously 
regulated and independently verified by the Irish Aviation Authority, operating to the highest EU safety requirements 
- and the IAA have recently confirmed that 'Ryanair's safety is on a par with the safest airlines in Europe'.

 Spanish fashion has slowly been taking over the UK high street with the likes of Zara, Mango, Massimo Dutti and 
Camper becoming ever more popular, as well as designers such as Collada García and Emilio de la Morena 
featuring in high end stores and at London Fashion Week.
 For the chance to see more than 26 emerging and professional fashion designers show case their summer 2014 
collections, the fashion pack should head to Valencia Fashion Week[1] from 19-21 September 2013.
 The event will host designers from Valencia[2] as well as from Madrid, Murcia, Canary Islands, Mallorca and Bilbao 
and it will be the chance to see what might hit the UK high streets in the Spanish stores next year.
 Valencia Fashion Week takes place in the centre of the city in the Agora, one of the most emblematic icons of 
Valencia and expects to attract around 32,000 visitors. Visitors to the city can watch the fashion shows for free live 
on a giant screen in Plaza de la Moda or pick up tickets for shows at the Plaza de los Pinazo, next to El Corte 
Inglés close to Colón Subway.
 The following young up and coming designers and brands will be showing:
 • Nomasculoblanco (www.nomasculoblanco.com[3]) - the first brand of swimming costume designed to get an 
allover tan, avoiding the usual white bikini marks. The name means 'no white bottom anymore' and they offer 
beautiful designs at very reasonable prices, from €22.
• Siemprevivas (www.siemprevivas.es[4]) - there are two designers in charge of this Valencian brand, Adrián 
Salvador and Lucas Saragosí. Designers such as British Peter Pilotto, (www.peterpilotto.com[5]) and Spanish 
Adolfo Domínguez (www.adolfodominguez.com[6]) have worked with them. 
• Adrián Salvador now works in New York with USA brand J. Mendel (www.jmendel.com[7]) and has since 
designed clothes for Michelle Obama and American Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, Vogue Manager. Valencian 
Ceramics company Peronda (www.peronda.com[8]) is the sponsor for Siemprevivas. 
 Away from the shows Valencia is a real mecca for shoppers where they can pick up anything from glamorous one-
off designer dresses to high street fashion, as well as unique ceramics, embroidered silk and traditional Valencia 
produce including rice, wine and olive oil. 
 For high street fashion head to Calle Colón or for quirky boutiques Barrio de Carmen; for jewellery visit the Vicente 
Gracia store (www.vicentregraciajoyas.com[9]), recognised as one of the 20th top jewellers in the world by Vogue 
magazine, and to see a fabulous variety of fresh produce head to the fabulous Colón Market 
(www.mercadocolon.es[10]), one of Europe's largest covered markets located in a stunning modernist building.
Fashionistas get a glimpse of next year's designs at 'Valencia Fashion Week' 19-26 September 2013
 The Valencia[11] region is well known for its ceramics and they come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from 
works of arts to kitchen staples. The famous Lladró porcelain (www.lladro.com[12]) celebrates its 60th anniversary 
this year and is the place to buy luxury handcrafted porcelain figures. 
 Valencia also has a great range of shoe shops and even a specialist pet boutique, complete with outfits and 
furniture for furry friends. 
 Shopping tours are a good way to discover the best places to shop and visitors can hire a personal shopping 
guide. Personal shopping tours have four main themes: Deluxe, Urban, Arts Crafts and Gifts and the guide will tailor 
the tour to suit your interests. There is even the chance to visit the factories and designers in their workspaces if 
this is something that is of interest.
 Factbox
 Valencia is easily accessed with direct flights with Ryanair from Bristol, East Midlands, Stansted, Manchester and 
Dublin, EasyJet from Gatwick and Iberia from Heathrow to Barcelona, with a connection to Valencia. 
 Shopping tours can be booked from €18 per person for a two hour tour.

 Flight comparison and booking website WhichAirline.com[1] has published a Windows Phone app[2] that aims to 
make it easier to search for flights from your smartphone. The Whichairlines app searches across more than 
100,000 routes, including those run by low cost carriers, such as EasyJet and RyanAir. Search results, which are 
filtered by quality (duration and length), are shown in a clean user interface that allows at a glance comparison of 
timings and pricing. Once you've selected your required flights you are taken to the airline's website for booking.
 Rather than create a full native Windows Phone app WhichAirline.com have opted to created a wrapper around the 
mobile version of their website. For an app that relies on an Internet connection to be useful this is a reasonable 
option, but does mean the look and feel on the app is more generic mobile than Windows Phone sprecific and 
performance is dependent on the speed and quality of the data connection. 
The app does have a few other foibles, such as an inability to remember which currency was selected on the 
previous use, but this is not uncommon for web-based apps where a hybrid mode and features such as settings 
require additional work to implement.
Comparing the Whichairline app with competing app Skyscanner[3] is a good illustration of the pitfalls of the web-
based versus native app on Windows Phone. Both get the job done, but Skyscanner feels like a more polished 
experience and fits in better with the Windows Phone look and feel. Regardless both apps are useful utilities for 
regular travellers who want the convenience of being able perform a quick flight comparison search from their 
phone.

All are welcome, as long as we all pay the same taxes
 Comments on issues raised in the Press Conference of Ryanair:
The Greek airline market is open and accessible to all.All European companies can operate in it with the same 
taxes and encumbrances which AEGEAN pays.AEGEAN contributes today to tourism with 4 million international 
passengers from Athens and the regions, compared to 1 million in 2004, marking a growth potential of 22% in 2013. 
Obviously, without State taxes and airport encumbrances, amounting to 160 million paid on annual basis, it could 
achieve even higher figures.In 2013 we achieved a significant increase by 15% in Athens as well, which was 
declining in recent years.In the past 3 years, 18 million passengers placed us, in the context of the Skytrax World 
Airline Awards, in the first place on a European level, as the 'Best Regional Airline in Europe', recognizing and 
rewarding the value for money that we offer. For us their opinion and reward are the most important.With regard to 
the domestic network, we have decreased our fares by 20-30% in the past 4 years, which means that the average 
fare today is €46 without taxes.We have made public and repeated commitments that even after the acquisition of 
Olympic Air we will continue to keep fare prices low. With everything Ryanair is reporting, it is misinforming the 
Greek market in an effort to achieve special tax treatment and exemptions. Ryanair's activity, as well as that of 
Easyjet and other low cost companies, has grown significantly in recent years. And this is fair because they provide 
more options to consumers. Further growth, either domestically or abroad, is also fair, as long as we all compete on 
equal terms. If the State's strategy includes a decrease of taxes and duties, this must refer to and benefit the entire 
airline market, without discriminations that create distortions.

Jul 31, 2013 (Pakistan and Gulf Economist:http://www.pakistaneconomist.com Delivered by Newstex)
 A business class on a budget carrier flight would have been considered as one of those classical paradoxes when 
low-cost airlines first started operating: Southwest airlines in the US and Ryan Air in Europe, Virgin Blue in 
Australia, Air Asia in Malaysiaand the Arabian Gulf's own Air Arabia in Sharjah. But when flydubai recently 
announced plans to introduce business class across its network of about 60 destinations, there was hardly any 
surprise.
 Given the growing dominance of low-cost carriers over legacy airlines in recent years, it was becoming increasingly 
evident to industry observers that future winners among the budget airlines will be decided by their ability to create 
a distinctive competitive advantage over their peers, which need not necessarily be based on price, but more on the 
basis of quality of service. This is in sharp contrast to the strategies of the pioneers who focused mainly on cost 
reduction in comparison to network carriers. 
 It is quite clear by now that the natural progression of the low-cost carriers is not their transformation into full-
service carriers, meaning the mainstream legacy carriers, but further development of their role revolving around the 
low-cost model itself. This has turned the attention of aggressive low-cost carriers, such as flydubai, for example, to 
more focused client relationship management, value-added services and strategies that reinvigorate the low-cost 
differentiation. Budget airlines may soon be offering airport transfers, holiday packages and similar products as a 
means to tap additional revenue generation opportunities.
 With their cost advantages and renewed focus on quality, budget carriers have forced the legacy carriers to rethink 
their pricing, positioning and distribution strategies. Low-cost no longer means low quality and this has made the 
task of legacy carriers even more challenging. Growth statistics of budget airlines make them the envy of legacy 
carriers in most parts of the world. More than half of the intra-European market, for instance, is reportedly captive to 
the budget airlines. In Asia, their market share has not grown on comparable scales, but the future growth of the 
aviation industry is set to shift its base from US and Europe to Asia, particularly India and China.
 Although the major legacy carriers such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have dominated the Gulf aviation 
market, budget carriers, led by Air Arabia, flydubai and Jazeera have begun to shake up the market.
 Cost-conscious travellers constitute the biggest market segment of the region's travel business and as such, low-
cost carriers offering no-frills travel that suits their needs and budget have become the most preferred option for a 
majority.
 NEW SEGMENT EMERGES
 With the budget airlines beginning to compete with differentiators based on quality, in addition to cost, a new 
segment of corporate travel is also developing within the low-cost carrier space. According to reports, while 75 per 
BUDGET AIRLINES
cent of budget airline travellers pay for their travel from their own pockets, there is a growing segment of 
passengers who use them on the company account.
 The share of such travellers has particularly increased as a response to the financial crisis and as a means to 
reduce corporate travel costs. This is the segment that flydubai hopes to tap through its business class offering.
 Flydubai is expected to take delivery of its first aircraft with the business class cabin next month. All subsequent 
new aircraft deliveries will include business and economy classes.
 Business class travellers will be offered a range of services, including a dedicated customer service team, priority 
check-in as well as priority baggage collection at the disembarkation point. Contrary to the typical ways of Dubai, 
flydubai has been a late entrant to the scene of budget travel, which has been dominated by Sharjah's Air Arabia as 
it enjoyed the first mover advantage and the business class move may be seen as a bid to wrest the 
initiative.Dubai's track record in the aviation sector, symbolised by Emirates airline, and its brand power can be 
potential winners for the new airline.

 Irish no-frills airline Ryanair said Monday that first-quarter net profits fell by more than a fifth, hit by higher fuel and 
operating costs, but maintained its annual earnings forecast.
 The company's performance was also hit by the timing of Easter and French air traffic control strikes.
 Earnings after taxes sank 21 percent to 78.1 million euros ($103.58 million) in the three months to the end of June, 
from 98.8 million euros in the same period of last year, Ryanair said in a results statement.
 Revenues jumped 5.0 percent to 1.342 billion euros from 1.284 billion euros in the same period last year, while 
passenger numbers climbed 3.0 percent to 23.2 million passengers in the reporting period.
 'As previously guided, higher fuel costs and the timing of Easter led to profits falling,' said chief executive Michael 
O'Leary in the earnings release.
 'As ever, our outlook remains cautious for the full year as market conditions are tough with recession, austerity, 
high fuel costs and excessive government taxes impacting air travel demands and yields.
 'While we expect full year traffic to grow 3.0 percent to 81.5 million, we still have no visibility over next winter's 
yields, and on the basis that the summer yield weakness in close-in summer bookings does not continue, we see 
no reason to change our full year profit after tax guidance which remains at between 570 million euros to 600 million 
euros,' O'Leary added.

Jul 31, 2013 (The Huffington Post:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 It costs how much to fly from London to Berlin? I just searched for the flight for mid-October and found incredibly 
(some would say "suspiciously") cheap offers from easyJet (€40 / $52) and Ryanair (€46 / $59).
 That's super cheapo, and not even unusual for Europe's budget airlines, which have been known to offer tickets for 
as low as £1... or even free. How is this possible? What's the catch?
 Pay attention to the airport
 To keep ticket prices low, budget airlines often use less-central airports that can take more time (and money) to get 
to. 
 For example, consider Ryanair's flights from London to Barcelona. Some of these flights arrive into Girona-Costa 
Brava airport, 57 miles away from Barcelona. Although regular bus service between the airport and Barcelona is 
timed according to arriving and departing flights, mishaps (and unintended overnights) do happen.
 Watch those baggage policies...
 Many budget carriers try to recoup losses on very low ticket prices through sky-high charges for checked and 
carry-on luggage. Take special note of the baggage policies when booking, and consider your options. And be 
aware that some carriers charge less if you pre-pay for your checked bags.
 Ryanair, for example, charges between €15-45[1] for checking luggage (up to 20 kg) when the bags are paid for in 
advance. If you forget and pay at the airport, you'll be charged an outrageous €60-140 for the first bag and €105-
160 for the second bag! There's nothing sadder than watching last-minute luggage catastrophes at the Ryanair 
bag-drop.
 ...and those hidden fees
 As my colleague Hilary Bown recently wrote on our blog[2], budget carriers famously tack on additional fees, 
including administrative fees, check-in charges, and credit card surcharges.
 For example, Ryanair charges a €7 "administrative fee" per flight, while easyJet charges €12.50 per order 
(regardless of number of tickets). And they both add a surcharge for tickets purchases by credit card (Ryanair 
charges two percent; easyJet 2.5 percent).
 Don't forget to compare trains as an option
 Europe's high-speed trains often offer a compelling alternative to flying, especially for shorter distances. For these 
routes (such as London to Paris, Paris to Brussels and Amsterdam, Barcelona to Madrid) the train might actually be 
faster once you add the time that it takes to get to the airports, checked in and through security.
 And once you consider baggage fees and extra charges, a high-speed train could easily be cheaper, too. (Read 
my previous post on booking rail tickets in Europe[3].)
Tips for Booking Flights on Europe's Budget Airlines
 Know where to search
 From the U.S., airfare on carriers such as easyJet[4], Ryanair[5], Germanwings[6] and others are not always easy 
to find, as they're often not included (or at least highlighted) in the search results of some of the largest airfare 
websites. 
 Expedia[7], for example, didn't show me Ryanair and easyJet flights on a recent search for London to Berlin, 
although Kayak[8] did. We also include them on our flights search on EuroCheapo[9], and we compare them to 
legacy carriers (such as Lufthansa[10] and Air France[11]), along with high-speed rail options.
 Book in advance and snag a great deal
 All caveats and hidden fees aside, Europe's budget airlines can offer some incredibly good deals. If you book in 
advance, limit your luggage and follow the rules, very cheap flights are possible.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] INTENSIFIED COMPETITION WITH AER LINGUS INCREASES 
AGAIN TO BENEFIT OF UK CONSUMERS WHILE UKCC INVENTS COMPETITION 'CONCERN' FAIRYTALES 
Ryanair, the UK's largest airline, today (31 July) announced that it would add additional daily frequencies from 
October on its five main Ireland-UK routes in a direct response to similar flight increases recently announced by Aer 
Lingus for the 2013-14 winter schedule. Aer Lingus' decision to increase flight frequencies on these UK routes 
further undermines the discredited UKCC investigation into Ryanair's 6 ½ year old minority (29%) stake in Aer 
Lingus. Confronted with incontrovertible evidence that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified, 
the UKCC has been reduced to inventing fairytale future 'concerns' that Ryanair has 'influence' over Aer Lingus or 
that this stake has or will lead to a lessening of competition.
The UKCC, in its provisional findings, has ignored, or excluded, 6 ½ years of evidence which totally disproves their 
bogus claims. It has failed to produce any evidence that competition would be lessened (or UK consumers 
penalised) when the European Commission recently (Feb 2013) prohibited Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus on the 
very grounds that competition has intensified between the two Irish airlines over the past 6½ years. If, as the UKCC 
now claims, Ryanair has 'influence' over Aer Lingus which 'might' lessen competition, then it should explain why Aer 
Lingus has recently increased flights on the five main Ireland-UK routes or why Ryanair is now responding with yet 
more flight frequency, which will lead to lower prices and better deals for those few UK consumers who actually fly 
Aer Lingus.
Ryanair will add at least one additional daily return flight from October 2013 to each of its top 5 Dublin-UK routes 
including London (STN), Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Bristol as follows:
RYANAIR INCREASES ON 5 DUBLIN-UK ROUTES - WINTER 2013-14 Ryanair continues to question why the 
UK's OFT and CC have wasted millions of UK taxpayer funds investigating a 6 ½ year old failed merger between 
two Irish airlines (which has little, if any, impact on any UK consumers) while at the same time neither quango took 
any action whatsoever on behalf of UK consumers when BA acquired BMI, or previously when Easyjet acquired GB 
Airways. The UKCC has failed to explain this glaring lack in consistency particularly when neither the EU nor the 
Irish competition authorities had any concerns about Ryanair's 6 ½ year old minority stake.
Since the UKCC inquiry has been unable to produce one shred of evidence that competition between Aer Lingus 
and Ryanair has lessened over the past 6 ½ years and since the UKCC has been forced to accept the EU's ruling 
(that intensified competition has benefited consumers) this has reduced the UKCC to flailing around, inventing 
fairytale future 'concerns' so that it can ignore the inconvenient truths of the last 6 ½ years of evidence. 
The UKCC's 3 fairytale future 'concerns' are disproven by the past 6 ½ years of evidence as follows;
Ryanair Adds More Flights On 5 Ireland -UK Routes
a)That Ryanair 'might' block a rights issue by Aer Lingus: however the UKCC have ignored the inconvenient truth 
that over the past 6 ½ years - Ryanair has repeatedly confirmed it will support take up rights to prevent dilution.
b)That Ryanair 'might' block a disposal by Aer Lingus of its Heathrow slots (despite the fact any such disposal 
would lessen competition between the two airlines) while ignoring the inconvenient fact that Aer Lingus, as recently 
as April 2013, disposed of a pair of Heathrow slots without any objection or block by Ryanair.
c)That Ryanair 'might' prevent another EU airline from acquiring Aer Lingus, and/or 'squeezing out' Ryanair. Again 
the UKCC has ignored the inconvenient truth that over the past 6 ½ years, no other EU airline has shown any 
interest in acquiring Aer Lingus and almost all other EU airlines have publicly stated that they have no interest in 
acquiring Aer Lingus.
In order to destroy any remaining shred of credibility from these bogus and invented 'concerns' Ryanair has offered 
to unconditionally and irrevocably dispose of its 29% minority shareholding to any other EU airline who offers for, 
and successfully acquires 50.1% of Aer Lingus (which is far below the legal 80% squeeze out threshold). This 
undertaking has been dismissed by many commentators on the very obvious grounds that no other EU airline 
wishes to acquire Aer Lingus, another inconvenient fact which the UKCC has conveniently ignored. Ryanair's 
undertaking removes any possibility that it can or could block an acquisition of Aer Lingus by another EU airline and 
sheds this UKCC process of any credibility whatsoever.
The UKCC's case now lies in tatters, as Simon Polito and his team flounder around, looking to invent new and even 
more fairytale 'concerns' when the inconvenient truth is that 6 ½ years of evidence proves that Ryanair's minority 
stake has resulted in intensified competition between the Irish airlines to the benefit of UK consumers. Finally, the 
UKCC has produced no shred of evidence whatsoever that any other EU airline - other than Ryanair - has any 
interest in acquiring Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'This misguided UKCC inquiry is a political farce which has no case, no evidence and no credibility either. 
1.The UKCC failed to investigate precedent UK airline mergers which affected millions of UK consumers (such as 
BA-BMI, or Easyjet-GB Airways) yet it's wasting millions investigating a 6 ½ year old failed merger between two 
Irish airlines which affects few, if any, UK consumers because Aer Lingus carries very few of them.
2.Having been asked by the OFT to check if competition has been lessened, even the UKCC has now been forced 
to accept that competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has intensified, which is precisely why the EU 
prohibited Ryanair's offer (for Aer Lingus) in Feb 2013.
3.When all the evidence proves that competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has intensified, Simon Polito and 
his ream - instead of taking a common sense approach and dismissing this inquiry - are now flailing around trying to 
invent future concerns which the last 6 ½ years of evidence thoroughly disproves, including: ¾Ryanair 'might' block 
a rights issue when Ryanair has said it will take up our rights to prevent dilution ¾Ryanair 'might' block the sale of 
Heathrow slots despite the fact that Ryanair has repeatedly not done so, and ¾Ryanair 'might' block another EU 
airline acquiring Aer Lingus despite 6 ½ years of evidence that no other EU airline has any interest in Aer Lingus.
4.Ryanair has offered an irrevocable and unconditional commitment that we will sell our 29% stake to any other EU 
airline which makes an offer and successfully acquires just 50.1% of Aer Lingus. We do this in the knowledge that 
even this unprecedented and revolutionary remedy will be ignored by a Competition Commission that is determined 
to ignore facts, hide evidence, misquote and mis-describe Ryanair's evidence while inventing bogus and imaginary 
future concerns so that it can arrive at a pre-determined conclusion, that one Irish airline be forced to sell down its 6 
½ year old minority shareholding in another Irish airline in a ruling which is even more draconian than that imposed 
in the BSkyB/ITV case (where millions of consumers were clearly affected).
Ryanair will pursue every legal avenue at its disposal, to expose this charade and overturn any baseless ruling by 
this biased UKCC which lacks any shred of credibility and even one iota of evidence. The fact that UK taxpayers' 
money is being wasted on a failed 6 ½ year old merger between two Irish airlines, when these useless regulators 
turned a blind eye to BA's acquisition of BMI or Easyjet's acquisition of GB Airways, remains to be explained by 
either the discredited OFT or this misguided competition inquiry.
In the meantime, Ryanair will continue to add flights and lower fares on those few UK city pairs where we compete 
with Aer Lingus so that UK consumers will continue to benefit from intensified competition even as the UKCC 
wastes time and UK taxpayers' money dreaming up new and even more fairytale 'concerns'.'

 Ryanair today posted a 21 per cent fall in first-quarter profits to €78m (£67.3m), due to higher fuel costs and the 
timing of Easter.
Ryanair said the drop was expected, and it still expected to meet expectations for full year profit.
The budget airline said that average fares fell four per cent during the period, but revenue per passenger grew one 
per cent. Fuel costs grew by 6% in the period, the company said, and now account for 47% of total costs.
Ryanair also said that "ancillary revenues" generated by the likes of credit card fees and charges for reserved 
seating jumped 25 per cent to €357m, accounting for 27% of total revenues.
Due to Easter falling earlier than usual this year, it meant profit from the period was included in Ryanair's fourth 
quarter results rather than the first quarter.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said its outlook remained "cautious" for the full year.
"Market conditions are tough with recession, austerity, high fuel costs, and excessive government taxes (most 
recently in Belgium) impacting air travel demand and yields," he said.
O'Leary said full-year passenger numbers are set to grow 3% to 81.5 million, but the group was maintaining its 
forecast for profits of between €570m and €600m.
Looking forward, he said: "We expect Q2 yields to rise despite last year's challenging (post-Olympic) comparables, 
although yields on close-in summer bookings have been slightly weaker in recent weeks due, we believe, to the 
heatwave in northern Europe.
In March, Ryanair placed an order with Boeing for 175 planes worth £10.3bn ($15.6bn) to be delivered between 
2014 and 2018. The deal will increase its fleet by a third to 400 planes.

 100,000 SEATS FROM JUST £19.99
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (26 July) helped celebrate 70 years of flight at London 
Stansted, by flying a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft into Stansted for a special ceremony marking the 70th 
anniversary of Stansted's runway.
Ryanair positioned one of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft alongside a P-47 Thunderbolt fighterplane, which had 
originally been based at Stansted during World War II. 70 years later, Ryanair is now Stansted's largest airline 
having grown to operate 118 routes, carrying over 170m passengers to/from Stansted since first arriving there in 
June 1987. This year, Ryanair will carry over 13m passengers to/from Stansted, sustaining over 13,000* 'on-site' 
jobs at Stansted Airport.
To celebrate 70 years of flight at Stansted, Ryanair is releasing 100,000 seats across its entire European network at 
prices starting from just £19.99 for travel on Mon, Tue, Wed Thur in September and October and these 'all in' low 
fares will be available on over 1,000 of Ryanair's European routes, but must be booked on www.ryanair.com before 
midnight (24:00hrs) Mon, 29 July.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:

technique is to try and laugh you off for being a bunch of nutcases. They did it to Galileo, they did it to Darwin, they 
did it to O'Leary from Ryanair… so to be mocked and derided is not unusual.
 The likelihood of UKIP electoral growth:
 The significant thing about May 2nd was that in the south they were screaming that if you voted UKIP you would let 
Labour in; if you voted UKIP you would let the Lib Dems in; or in the north if you voted UKIP you would let the 
Conservatives in. But what happened was that if you voted UKIP you got UKIP… Who is to say that by doing what 
the Lib Dems did in the 80s and 90s, by building up clusters of support, we find ourselves in the position were we 
become serious challengers for seats in 2015.

four would dispute that claim.] They all come from extraordinary privilege. They have all come from top public 
schools, into Oxbridge, into research offices, into the House of Commons. It's all well and good having a few people 
like that, but what you expect to see from political leadership in a political party is a bit more of a balanced team … I 
think with UKIP we are speaking the kind of language that ordinary people speak and we are demonstrably of this 
world.
 UKIP manifesto:
 UKIP just doesn't talk about who governs Britain, but about how Britain should be governed. The entire UKIP 
manifesto is about what we do after we have left the European Union.
 Cameron:
 What drives Cameron? Rank. Position. Title.
 Populist:
When Alex met Nigel #8211; interview with UKIP leader
 I haven't formed a bandwagon and it wasn't populist when I got involved. When I first started talking about 
immigration, climate change and the EU this was all far from being populist.
 Regrets:
 I've already given up all the baubles. I've already given up a prosperous life to do this. I've followed a belief. I've 
followed a passion. I've helped - I think - to make something possible that everyone thought was impossible. That's 
worth a lot more than money.
 Conservative Party membership:
 I was in the Conservative Party in the Keith Joseph, Thatcher years. That's when I used to think I was a 
Conservative—but now, on reflection, I realise I never was a Conservative. I was a radical economic liberal. I was a 
member from 1978-1990 and I left when it joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism. I felt completely betrayed.
 Looking forward to the 2014 Euro elections:
 If UKIP was able to become the top party in the UK in the Euro elections in 2014 then that is a political earthquake. 
There is a huge message being sent out … to our political classes here. It's one that will give us such momentum 
that unless they seriously respond to it then I think anything is possible.
 Early UKIP:
 You could tell it was a UKIP meeting in the 1990s because of the number of Bomber Command ties in the front 
row. There is no doubt many of our earlier supporters hated Europe. If I showed you the early membership of UKIP 
in the south of England there were very few people below the rank of major. It was all the WW2 generation who felt 
completely betrayed by Maastricht. They had given up on the political class … But now we are much more of a 
positive party then we are a negative party.
 Sinn Fein:
 The peace process has changed Sinn Fein more than it's changed anybody actually … It's amazing what a 
ministerial car can do.
 Approach to Assembly:
 One of the debates we are going to have in UKIP is what approach we are going to take to the next Assembly 
election. Are we going to go in there with a radical reform platform or not?
 When asked were UKIP going to fight every Assembly seat:
 That's very much our intention, but again there is going to have to be a degree of quality control and trying to get 
that all right; but yes they are the intentions … And I think non-sectarian politics has a place; or at least I think it 
should have a place; I'd like to see it have its place. That's consistent with our thinking … I think there is a gap in 
the market for us.
 When asked about a possible UKIP/ TUV deal:
 I think that whilst UKIP and the TUV would have quite strong agreement on the European question, I think that on 
many of the other issues the divide may be too great. I think it's difficult but I also think it's not up to me to intervene 
too much myself.

Ryanair 's Latest Stunt: Planes As Billboards
Ryanair's Latest Stunt: Planes As Billboards

 Filed under: Airlines[1] [ Image removed ]Courtesy Ryanair Low-cost carrier Ryanair will charge for just about 
anything. The company has even announced it'll be selling ad space on the outsides of its planes[2]. From pay-per 
pee toilets to the promise of oral sex, this is far from the first ridiculous stunt Ryanair has pulled over the years. It 
makes us a little skeptical these billboards will get off the ground.
 Let's take a look at the company's -- and, perhaps more importantly, CEO Michael O'Leary's -- track record over 
the years:
2013: Ryainair sells ad space on planes 2012: Ryanair plans to increase plane door width to speed up boarding[3] 
2011: Ryanair teaches 'mutiny' students how to pack[4] 2011: Ryanair jokes about "child-free" flights[5] 2010: CEO 
questions need for co-pilots on flights[6] 2009: Ryanair talks about introducing standing-room only seats[7] 2009: 
Ryanair begins media storm about pay-per pee toilets[8] 2008: CEO says business class passengers get free oral 
sex[9]
 That's at least one PR stunt per year, leading us to believe the "planes as billboards" idea won't take off. Besides, 
it's a little doubtful that anyone would fork over more than $26,000 for a tiny ad[10] that only people waiting in 
departure lounges can actually see (if they're close enough, that is). Ryanair's Latest Stunt: Planes As

 Wednesday 24 July, 2013
 Manchester Airport saw 2.1 million passengers use the airport during June 2013, according to figures released 
today. 
 This was a rise of 4.1% when compared to June 2012, and marks a 13th consecutive month of year on year growth 
for the gateway to the North. 
 Figures released this month by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also show that Manchester Airport was above the 
UK airport average of passenger growth in June. The UK airport average growth was 3.2%. 
 The statistics showed international scheduled flight traffic to be up by 9.4%. New services such as EgyptAir's 
service to Cairo launched in June while TAP Portugal announced an increase of weekly flights to Lisbon, taking 
them from seven a week to ten. The new route to Cairo allowed Egytpair to expand its network with the start of a 
five times per week service between Manchester and the Egyptian capital. Cairo is the northern gateway to Africa 
and passengers have convenient onward access to more than 18 African destinations. 
 An on-going focus on the low cost sector has also gone some way towards Manchester's success as the third 
stage of the airport's 'Fly Manchester' campaign launched in June, continuing to raise awareness of Manchester 
Airport as home to the most low cost flights in the North. Airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair, Monarch, Jet2.com, 
Germanwings and Norwegian continue to grow from Manchester. 
 The passenger performance continues a recent positive trend and Virgin Atlantic also announced during June that 
they would be offering 30,000 extra return seats to Orlando from Manchester Airport in summer 2014. Virgin 
Atlantic will fly daily from Manchester Airport and twice a day on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. 
 Ken O'Toole, Chief Commercial Officer for MAG, owners of Manchester Airport, said: "We've seen over a year of 
continued month-on-month growth now and the next few months will provide an additional boost as over 14m 
passengers are expected to use Manchester Airport during the summer. We're entering the full swing of the 
summer season and are expecting a further surge in passengers once the schools break up as millions of people fly 
away for a well-deserved break." 
 The top five foreign destinations for this summer are currently Palma, Amsterdam, Dubai, Alicante and Tenerife 
with August 23rd anticipated to be the busiest day of the summer this year. Passenger figures show that 84,000 
passengers are expected to travel through Manchester Airport on Friday August 23rd. The same day last year 
peaked at 80,000 passengers travelling through the airport. 
Manchester Airport Announces Passenger Number Increase
 Manchester Airport is part of MAG, the UK's second largest airport operator, serving 42 million passengers every 
year through its ownership and operation of Manchester, London Stansted, East Midlands and Bournemouth 
airports.

• Manchester Airport is the global gateway for the North of the UK and the largest airport outside London with over 
200 destinations served by 65 airlines. 
• Manchester's long-haul catchment area places around 24 million people and 60% of all UK businesses within a 
two-hour drive time - it extends north through the Lake District into Scotland; east across Yorkshire and the North 
East; south to Birmingham and the Midlands; and west into Merseyside and Wales.

 In anticipation of Prince William and Catherine Duchess of Cambridge's firstborn, Great Britain[5] has had baby 
fever[6]. Now that the royal baby has finally arrived, the travel industry is taking advantage of the frenzy. Even 
Heathrow gave out special T-shirts yesterday[7]. Nothing like a baby to stimulate the economy after all.
 It might take awhile for the royal baby to become king. Meanwhile, we commoners can take full advantage.
1. Fly for Free (If You Are a Baby)
Infants fly free of charge[8] today on RyanAir. Time to make a last minute travel decision and buy a ticket before the 
day is up. The bottle of milk will probably be an extra charge, however.
2. Sleep Like a British Baby
Kate isn't the only one popping out a baby this year. According to Visit England 700,000 babies will be born in 
England this year, which is why the tourism board has opted to put an emphasis on baby themed travel options[9]. 
Maybe the most notable is the Grosvenor House Hotel where you can stay in the Premium Park View Suite. In 
celebration of the royal birth the suite has been turned into a quintessential English nursery, including a hand-
painted doll house toy closet. But sleeping like a royal baby isn't cheap; the room runs $3,428, and that's without a 
babysitter.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1]
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC) today (23 July) confirmed that, as part of its ongoing remedies 
discussions with the UK Competition Commission (CC) in a case where the CC have produced no evidence 
whatsoever of any lessening of competition as a result of Ryanair's 6½ year old 29% shareholding in Aer Lingus, 
Ryanair has now offered the following undertaking to the CC:
In order to dispel the CC's unfounded and invented 'concern' that Ryanair's shareholding may prevent Aer Lingus 
from being acquired by another EU airline, Ryanair will undertake to unconditionally sell its 29% shareholding to any 
other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and obtains acceptances from 50.1% of Aer Lingus 
shareholders.
The above remedy is without prejudice to Ryanair's vehement objection to the CC's manifestly false conclusion that 
Ryanair has influence over Aer Lingus' commercial strategy and/or that Ryanair's 6½ year old minority shareholding 
in Aer Lingus has resulted in a lessening of competition. This conclusion is flatly contradicted by 6½ years of 
evidence, by the European Commission's findings in February 2013 that competition between Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus has intensified, and by the evidence submitted even by Aer Lingus and the Irish Government (to the EU), 
which proves that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus intensified to the benefit of consumers over the last 
6½ years. 
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'It is clear from the CC's own Provisional Findings report that it has found no evidence of any lessening of 
competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus. In fact, Ryanair's recent (3rd) offer for Aer Lingus was prohibited by 
the EU precisely because of the evidence, submitted by both Aer Lingus and the Irish Government, that competition 
between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has 'intensified' during the past 6½ years.
These inconvenient facts have reduced the CC's Simon Polito (Chairman) and Roger Davis (Member) to inventing 
new and fantastical 'concerns' in order to justify their apparently premeditated and biased 'thinking' that Ryanair 
should be forced to sell down this 6½ year old minority stake. The only remaining 'concern' they can now dream up 
is that Ryanair's 29% stake 'might' prevent another EU airline buying Aer Lingus; despite 6½ years of evidence (and 
repeated public statements) that no other EU airline has any interest in acquiring Aer Lingus. 
In order to remove any remaining shred of credibility from this CC process and eliminate any doubt about this 
imaginary albeit non-existent 'concern', Ryanair has now agreed that it will unconditionally sell its 6½ year old 
Ryanair Offers To Sell Aer Lingus Stake To Another EU Airline
minority stake to any other EU airline which makes an offer for, and acquires more than 50.1% of, Aer Lingus 
shares, at the same price and terms which are accepted by these other 50.1% of Aer Lingus shareholders. This 
remedy unconditionally removes any ability by Ryanair to block any future takeover of Aer Lingus by another EU 
airline. 
This bogus CC 'concern' has now been fatally undermined thereby removing any requirement for a divestment of 
Ryanair's 6½ year old minority shareholding which even the CC now admits hasn't given Ryanair any influence, and 
Aer Lingus admits has led to intensified competition to the benefit of the perhaps 1 or maybe 2 UK consumers who 
even fly Aer Lingus.'

            http://reveries.com/index.phpOur relative comfort with flying could explain why we are more willing to 
tolerate more plane pain, suggests Darrell Hartman in a Wall Street Journal review of Full Upright and Locked 
Position[1], by Mark Gerchick (7/19/13). "Free pillows, hot meals and many of the other disappearing hospitality 
rituals, after all, hail from a time when airlines had to convince fliers that they hadn't boarded a death trap," Darrell 
writes. The result is an in-flight experience that, as Mark notes, "is a jarring contradiction - amazing and god-awful 
at the same time."
 The book chronicles changes in air travel over the past 12 years, largely because of "the security lockdown that 
followed 9/11 … the mid-2000s spike in fuel costs and the triumph of low-cost airlines … For traditional airlines, this 
has meant a starker division than ever between first-class and back-of-plane travelers." Actually, "which class you 
fly doesn't matter as much as an innocent letter on your ticket - the fare code," which tells any airline employee 
whether you paid full fare and can determine how well - or poorly - you are treated if you make a request or lodge a 
complaint.
 Bargain airlines - like JetBlue and Southwest - meanwhile "more or less admit that flying isn't a luxury." As RyanAir 
CEO Michael O'Leary puts it: "Really, it's just a bloody bus with wings." The average passenger's best hope today 
is "a flight that is boring, reliable and only mildly unpleasant … The waning aspects of air travel's escapist aspects 
may also explain" why airports "where passengers spend much more time than they used to - now are designed to 
be tourist destinations in themselves … hoping for more enjoyable air travel, we come back down to earth."

 Filed under: Airlines[1], News[2] [ Image removed ][3]Hyougushi[4], Flickr As airlines continue to squeeze all the 
add-on fees they possibly can out of travelers, it isn't in-flight Wi-Fi[5] or extra legroom[6] that is bringing in the most 
money. The fastest-growing moneymaker for airlines comes from in-flight meal purchases, and passengers are 
eating the fees up. Shockingly, airlines have been known to charge up to 2,600 percent more than supermarkets[7] 
for drinks and snacks -- such as $4 for a bottle of water. Here are some examples:
Blueberry muffin on easyJet: $3.83. In store: $2.25. Check Mix on US Airways: $3.49. In store: $2.19. Clif Bar on 
American Airlines: $2.89. In store: $1.50. Kit Kat Bar on Aer Lingus: $2. In store: $0.79. Peanut MMs on Delta Air

Travelers, don't let the airlines nickel and dime you. Avoid a la carte fees by packing snacks in your carry-on

 Good morning, AdLand. Here's what you need to know today:
 CP+B laid off 21 people, less than 3% of its office,[1] following its loss of Old Navy as a client. The shop worked 
with the retailer for five years and created nostalgic ads that reunited cast members from "Blossom," "90210," and 
the "National Lampoon Family Vacation" series. It also created the strange Super Modelquins family[2].
 Weight Watchers explains why it chose OgilvyOne to lead its digital account[3] over Havas Digital, Razorfish, and 
360i.
 Marketers are preparing themselves for the arrival of the royal baby.[4]
 Interpublic saw declines in second quarter and first half of the year profits. Net income dropped 19%, coming in at 
$79.9 million. Revenue, however, grew. See all the numbers here.[5]
 Innovid CEO Zvika Netter on pre-roll ads and what they need to do to dominate video.[6]
 Hulu is heavily marketing its new animated series "The Awesomes."[7]
 Soon-to-be former CEO of Razorfish Bob Lord is leaving the Publicis Groupe shop on August 1 to become the 
CEO of AOL Networks.[8] But he'll stay close. Lord will also lead the new Publicis/AOL partnership. Pete Stein was 
named the new CEO of Razorfish.
 Wes Phelan joined Johannes Leonardo[9] as a senior art director. He will work with Coca-Cola, Google, Sprite, and 
Nike. Phelan was previously at MetropolitanRepublic in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Jul 18, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 From the notoriously cheap European airline that once considered charging passengers for using the toilet[1], 
Ryanair has come up with a new money-making scheme: Paint other companies' logos on its 303 planes.[2]
 With four possible ad locations to choose from — Ryanair will keep its own logo on the tail fin — 
spokesperson Robin Kiely told potential partners this offer "ensure[es] their brand is featured on Europe's largest - 
and cheapest - outdoor advertising medium."
 Air Nation reports[3] that a 12 month placement, the lowest unit, would cost "a fraction of the price of a newspaper 
advert."
 "Air billboards" aren't entirely unheard of. Air New Zealand placed a temporary "Hobbit" decal on a Boeing 777-
300ER[4] to promote the locally shot film franchise — there was also a "Lord of the Rings"-inspired in flight safety 
video[5] and a terrifying 43-foot sculpture of Gollum floating in New Zealand's Wellington International airport — but 
that was just one plane.
 Ryanair has a history of finding strange ways to save a buck. Most of them never ended up coming into fruition and 
seem to be said strictly for publicity purposes. O'Leary once publicly asked Businessweek[6], "Why does every 
plane have two pilots? ... Really you only need one pilot. Let's take out the second pilot. Let the bloody computer fly 
it."
 Other cost cutting proposals include:
Offering standing room only seats starting at £1. Regulators nixed the idea in spite of Ryanair founder Michael 
O'Leary's statement[7], "if there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid a seatbelt won't save you." Making 
flyers pay to use the bathroom during a flight.[8] (The coin-operated toilet idea was dropped in 2011) Cutting down 
to one toilet per plane[9] to make room for more seats Considering offering more expensive in-flight porn[10] 
Creating planes with just one big door allowing two people through simultaneously[11] to cut down on boarding and 
deboarding time Charging a "fat tax" for overweight passengers. This was rejected by Ryanair in the end "because 
it is not collectible"[12] and would cut down on its quick turnaround service.
Still, Ryanair sent an email to journalists asking not to be referred to as a "no frills" airliner[13] anymore.
 While these proposals didn't go through, the exterior advertising is a far likelier scenario. In fact, economically 
struggling American cities have begun putting ads on fire trucks[14]. Ryanair also offers advertising on boarding 
cards and on board[15] — as you would see ads inside a subway train or bus.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, the UK's only ultra low cost carrier (ULCC) today (18 July) 
made a submission to the UK Government's Airports Commission, calling on Sir Howard Davies and his team to 
resolve the 30 year old runway shortage in the South East of England by recommending that each of the 3 main 
London airports, Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted, be allowed to develop, at the earliest possible date, one new 
additional runway each, which will result in 3 new runways serving London, which will finally address runway 
capacity in the South East for the next 50 years, thereby allowing competition between the 3 airports, to ensure that 
these new runways are delivered in a timely, efficient and cost competitive manner which will maximise the gains 
for UK consumers and visitors.
Ryanair in its submission has rubbished any new Greenfield airport plan such as 'Boris Island', which it criticised as 
being more of the failed political interference that has bedevilled UK infrastructure projects over the past 30 years. 
Ryanair believes that any new greenfield airport will take many decades to deliver, and will result in vast 
overspending and inefficiency due to the absence of any existing airport or ground transport infrastructure at any 
such greenfield site. 
The approval of 3 new London runways will prevent the kind of regulatory gaming which has bedevilled London 
runway capacity under the failed BAA airport monopoly, and the 'inadequate' CAA regulatory regime over the past 
30 years. This failed airport regulatory model allowed the BAA monopoly to constrain capacity delivery, in order to 
charge monopoly prices to airlines and consumers, which has done such damage to UK aviation and tourism since 
the BAA airport monopoly was first privatised in the 1980's. Ryanair has called on the Airports Commission to adopt 
its 3 new London runway proposal, which is the timeliest, most efficient long-term solution to the chronic runway 
shortages currently suffered by all airlines and passengers at the 3 main London airports. This new 3 runway 
strategy will restore London's leadership of European aviation - without any political funding - and enable the South 
East to respond competitively to the new runway developments which have recently been completed in Madrid, 
Paris and Frankfurt.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
'Three new runways at the three competing London airports is the only sensible and consumer focused solution to 
the chronic runway capacity shortages in London and the South East of England. We cannot wait 30 years and 
allow billions of pounds to be wasted on 'Borris Island'. Because each airport and each airline (apart from Ryanair) 
wants to limit competition, they tend to advocate only one runway solutions and only at their airport. This means 
that UK aviation will continue to be hand-cuffed by political interference, and 'NIMBY' opposition which has stymied 
Ryanair Calls For 3 New London Runways, 1 Each At Gatwick, Heathrow And Stansted
aviation policy for the last 30 years. The UK in general and London in particular is being left behind by new runway 
developments in competitor cities such as Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid. 
 The failure of recent UK Governments to stand up to misleading environmental groups and their willingness to 
pander to narrow 'NIMBY' interests at individual airports has allowed UK aviation, tourism and job creation to be 
hijacked by backward looking luddites. Sadly the very appointment of the Davies Commission is just the latest 
example of the spineless approach of David Cameron's Government which talks about stimulating growth and job 
creation, but instead of pursuing growth policies they pander to tree huggers and NIMBYS.
Ryanair believes that the solution to the runway shortage in London is both simple and straightforward. Thanks to 
the recent break up of the BAA airport monopoly, London now has three competing airports, but no spare runway 
capacity. Instead of pandering to the expensive lobbyists of Ferrovial and Heathrow, the Davies Commission should 
recommend that three new runways be developed and allow the marketplace and competition between these three 
airports to deliver timely, cost efficient and consumer friendly runway capacity growth in the manner that will most 
benefit UK consumers, UK tourism and UK job creation. These 3 new runways will in turn deliver an additional 
100m passengers p.a., which - given Airport Council International figures - will sustain about 100,000 new jobs 
across the 3 London airports. These 3 new runways will also exploit the advantage of the existing road, rail, 
underground and coach infrastructure which already serves these London airports, without the waste, delay and 
inefficiency of trying to develop a new greenfield airports and ground transport to serve them.
Approving 3 new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted is also the only way to keep Ferrovial/Heathrow 
honest as it promotes its plans to waste further billions on inefficient, gold-plated facilities which will allow them to 
again 'game' the CAA's inadequate regulatory regime to further penalise airlines and passengers at Heathrow, with 
much higher charges. Competition between the airlines has significantly reduced UK air fares over the past 30 
years to such an extent that Ryanair now carries more passengers than British Airways and Easyjet combined. The 
Davies Commission (while being another example of David Cameron kicking the can down the road) offers a 
unique opportunity to finally introduce effective competition and excess capacity in London's runway infrastructure 
and Ryanair hopes that Sir Howard and his team will seize this historic opportunity.'

Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (17 July) offered businesses across the world the 
chance to advertise their brand on its fleet of 303 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and reach millions of European 
passengers through Europe's largest and cheapest outdoor advertising medium.
Ryanair operates over 1,600 flights per day, connecting 180 destinations in 29 countries, through over 1,600 routes

 Companies can have their brand featured on four different locations on the Ryanair aircraft, including on the inner 
and outer winglets, front fuselage and rear fuselage, for a 12-month period, for a fraction of the price of a 
newspaper advert.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
'Ryanair is Europe's largest carrier, flying more aircraft between more airports and carrying more international 
passengers than any other airline. And it's not just low fares that we deliver as we're now offering businesses the

its 9.5mth passenger to/from Cork. In just 26 years Ryanair has grown from a one route operation at Cork to now 
offering passengers in the South West a choice of 24 top European destinations across 7 countries.
To celebrate carrying 9.5 m passengers to/from Cork, Ryanair is launching a 100,000 seat sale across its entire 
European network with fares starting from as little as €22.99 for travel in September and October. These seats must 
be booked on www.ryanair.com before midnight (24:00hrs) Thurs (18 July).
 Ryanair's Maria Macken said:

Cork airport 26 years ago with a route to London Stansted and today it offers passengers in the South West a 
choice of 24 destinations across 7 countries including a new winter route to East Midlands.
To celebrate our 9.5m passenger milestone, Ryanair is releasing 100,000 seats across our entire European

 Villas in Sicily are a very popular option for holidaymakers, and now Ryanair has announced a new flight to the 
island from London Stansted.
Cambridge, UK -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 07/16/2013 -- 24, June 2013: Villas in Sicily have long been popular with 
holidaymakers keen to experience the fascinating culture and history of this famous island, not to mention the 
beautiful scenery and gorgeous weather. And now travellers from the UK will have even more chance to travel here 
following the budget airline Ryanair's announcement that is is launching a new route from London Stansted to 
Comiso in Sicily.
 Details of the new route have just been announced, and it has been confirmed that it will start operating from 
September 18 this year. It will operate twice a week, flying out of Stansted every Wednesday and Sunday.
 People keen to book villas in Sicily[2] will be pleased to hear that the initial launch fares are also going to be low, 
as is usually expected from Ryanair. The fares are likely to start from as little as £31, which includes all of the 
required fees and taxes, making it an excellent budget option for anyone on the look out for some late summer sun 
on a budget. However, hold baggage and priority boarding will push this price up.
 The news brings the total number of Italian flights offered by Ryanair from London Stansted to 18. However, this 
latest route is certain to prove popular as holiday villas in Sicily have long proved to be incredibly tempting for 
tourists looking for an excellent holiday destination that is not too far away but provides a complete change of scene 
and can be enjoyed on a budget.
 However, the budget £31 seats are not available for long, and they are only going to be available for people 
travelling to Sicily in September and October this year. However, even passengers who do not manage to snap up 
one of these cheap deals can still expect to enjoy a budget trip to Sicily because Ryanair is known for offering great 
deals on its flights throughout the year.

Kotzebue feasts on large halibut bycatch delivery

Jul 05, 2013 (Alaska Dispatch:http://www.alaskadispatch.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Locals in Kotzebue and surrounding Northwest Alaska villages got a surprise influx of white fish. No, not sheefish. 
The Coast Guard delivered 13,000 pounds of halibut bycatch -- fish that otherwise would have gone to waste -- in 
an effort brought forth by the Washington-based nonprofit SeaShare, and Ocean Beauty Seafoods out of Kodiak. 
Since its inception 20 years ago, SeaShare has donated millions of pounds of seafood to various agencies, 
including food banks, across the country. "SeaShare has been working hard to reach more Northern Alaska 
villages," said executive director Jim Harmon from Washington on Friday. "I was disappointed I didn't get to go to 
Kotzebue. It's such a great community. I wanted to make the handoff to the people who are receiving the fish." 
Nana Regional Corp.'s Liz Moore was there when the C-130 Hercules landed with boxes upon boxes of gutted, 
headed halibut. Moore was recruited to find a crew, divide the fish and facilitate delivery to 10 villages. No small 
task, especially on a tight deadline. "We had to move really fast to mobilize people," Moore said Monday. "We don't 
have a regional food bank." So locals were enlisted to help unload, sort and reload the fish. "I really want to stress 
that this was a partnership between Nana and Maniilaq; we partnered up to get this figured out," Moore said. "We 
looked at the population of each village and estimated how many pieces of fish would go to each village." The 
halibut was divided accordingly between Kotzebue, Deering, Buckland, Selawik, Kiana, Ambler, Kobuk, Shungnak, 
Noorvik, Noatak and Kivalina. It was then flown to the villages thanks to the generosity of FBX, Ryanair, Era 
Aviation and Bering Air, said Moore. The halibut, which was the bycatch from trawlers delivering to Kodiak, was first 
offered to village elders. Once they were taken care of, fish went to various assisted living facilities including Lake 
Street House in Kotzebue. It was then doled out to community members. "People were really excited and they 
really appreciated it," Moore said. "A lot were asking how to cook it," she added with a laugh. Moore added that 
while donations of this nature don't happen very often, especially from Outside sources, it's not unheard of for the 
communities to receive contributions now and then. In 2009, SeaShare donated salmon to Kotzebue and 
surrounding communities. Harmon said SeaShare has a goal of working more with rural Alaska villages but the cost 
of shipping makes it prohibitive. This latest venture was a collaborative effort between SeaShare, Carlile Transport 
and many other companies, including financial support from ConocoPhillips. "No one does this for the tax 
incentive," Harmon said. "They do it because they respect the resource. (Fisheries) really try to avoid bycatch, but 
they feel they should use everything in the catch. This is a way to give back to the communities." The Coast Guard 
was enlisted back in 2009 to make the salmon delivery to Kotzebue, so Harmon contacted them again last week in 
hopes they'd help out again. "It took some time, but they were more than willing to do it," she said. This story first 
appeared in The Arctic Sounder.[1]

Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] 140 CONSTRUCTION JOBS SUSTAINED, 50,000 SQ FT FOR RENT 
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (4 July) announced it had appointed John Paul 
Construction as its chosen contractors to fit out its new Dublin office building in Airside Business Park in Swords, 
which will become Ryanair's new Dublin office.
 The 100,000 sq ft building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations, including its commercial, customer service, 
finance, IT, legal and marketing departments. Works on the building commenced in late June, sustaining 140 
construction and engineering jobs during the envisaged 20-week fit-out, and Ryanair remains on course to move all 
of its Irish office operations and approximately 400 staff from its current offices at Dublin Airport to Airside before 
the end of 2013. 
Ryanair is offering up to half (approx. 50,000 sq ft) of this building for rent to other high profile multi-national 
companies who are looking for high-spec offices in a great location, with ready access to Dublin Airport and interest 
is already high. Ryanair will continue to maintain some facilities at Dublin Airport for its pilots and cabin crew. 
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: 'Ryanair is pleased to announce the appointment of John Paul Construction as its 
chosen contractors to fit out its new Dublin office building at Airside Business Park, Swords, County Dublin. This 
brand new 100,000 sq ft state-of-the-art building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations and some 400 staff will 
be based there when we complete our move before the end of 2013. This is a significant investment by Ryanair, 
allowing us the space and facilities to further develop our Dublin organisation, at much lower costs than the high 
rents on the Dublin Airport campus and allowing other staff currently housed in satellite offices to be brought 
together under one roof, resulting in a large reduction in rental expenses and further cost savings. The four-month 
fit-out will support some 140 construction jobs, while Ryanair's Airside Business Park relocation will also provide a 
welcome economic boost for the growing town of Swords, which continues to attract blue-chip corporations - 
including the world's largest airline.'

We Flew On The Notorious Spanish Discount Airline That Has So Little Legroom Some Passengers Can't Sit

We Flew On The Notorious Spanish Discount Airline That Has So Little 
Legroom Some Passengers Can't Sit Down
The Business Insider

Jul 04, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Frequent flyers joke that legroom on airlines only seems to get smaller and smaller. But there's always been an 
assumption that some minimal amount of legroom must be required for humans to fit into the seats they're selling.
 Not anymore.
 I flew from Split, in Croatia, to Barcelona on a new Spanish airline called Vueling recently, and learned to my cost 
that an airline can indeed make a seat's "pitch" — the distance between each row of seats that gives passengers 
their legroom — shorter than the thigh bones of the humans sitting in them.
 Here's the proof:
What this photo does not adequately convey is that my knees are solidly jammed against the seat back in front of 
me. There was, literally, no legroom. I could barely sit down. For part of the flight I sat with my knees diagonally 
invading the spaces of the passengers on either side of me.
 I wasn't the only one. There was a lot of laughing and eye rolling among all the passengers when we boarded and 
discovered how difficult it was going to be to slide into the space allotted.
 At the end of the 2 hour flight, my knees looked like this:
Vueling's short haul seat pitch[1] is just 30 inches according to Business Traveller. That's on the short side, but it's 
still more (allegedly) than the notorious Ryanair, whose seats offer only 29 inches between each one[2].
 The bruises came not simply because of the lack of space, however. They also came from this array of jagged 
nuts, bolts and screws in the seat back in front of me:
That turned out to be my bad luck — the seat was missing a part; all the other seats had a plastic cover on those 
fastenings.
 I should point out that I'm 6'3", (1.950 meters to the Spanish) and therefore I tend to suffer when there is a lack of 
legroom. But 6'3" isn't unusual in the human race. The average American male is 5'9" or more (1.763 m).
 Spanish males are even taller: 5'10" (1.78 m) on average — so Vueling is even worse for them than it is for us.
 Which made the next leg of my journey on Vueling — from to Barcelona to Menorca — even more puzzling. On 
that flight, I had plenty of room:
We Flew On The Notorious Spanish Discount Airline That Has So Little Legroom Some Passengers Can't Sit 
Down
Perhaps I just had an unfortunate seat assignment, like when you sit down on a bus and realize that your seat is 
above the wheel well and there's nowhere to put your feet. But a little research shows that Vueling is newly 
infamous for squashing its passengers into improbably small spaces.
 On Yelp, "Elite '13" writes[3]:
 If you have the overwhelming longing to experience life as a sardine then Vueling Airlines is for you! I saw a 130 
pound guy who was 5 foot 6 have to contort his body and literally fall into a seat because they are so compact. I 
mean they really squeeze you in there. We were shoulder to shoulder and even folks with short legs had theirs 
pressed against the seat in front of them. 
 On Flyertalk, Flying Finn says[4]:
 Yes, the seat pitch on Vueling is quite abysmal. The same can be said for many other carriers as well. But unless 
you are very obese or tall you should survive the less than two hour flight, just get an aisle seat if you can't get an 
exit row and stretch your legs down the aisle.
 And on AirlineInequality, Tony Quinn says[5]:
 Plane was old, legroom was poor compared to easyjet.
 "Poor compared to EasyJet." Wow. EasyJet is the airline that led the no-frills flying craze in Europe; it's well known 
for skimping and charging for everything it can.
 We left a message with Vueling; we'll update this post if we hear back.

 June 29--Behold the airline industry's latest attempt at cutting weight in an effort to save on fuel: Indian airline 
GoAir is looking to hire mainly female flight attendants in the future. Because they weigh less.
 The Times of India reports [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/GoAir-opts-for-female-crew-
to-save-fuel/articleshow/20805888.cms] that male flight attendants typically weigh 33-44 pounds more than the 
female ones. For every flight hour, GoAir says, it costs (by the current exchange rate) $0.76 extra for the male flight 
attendant compared to a female one.
 GoAir currently has 330 cabin crew members, 40% of whom are males. While the 130 or so male flight attendants 
will keep flying, future cabin crew recruitments will all be female, the airline says. It expects to hire about 2,000 
attendants and pilots over the next seven years.
 And that's not the only measure that the airline is taking to improve fuel efficiency.
 "We are reducing the weight on board our aircraft. The size of inflight magazines has been reduced. The potable 
water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35% to 40% of that water is actually used. Now the water 
tanks are filled 60%," GoAir CEO Giorgio De Roni told the paper. "Operational procedures have been revised with 
aircraft now doing single engine taxi to save fuel."
 As 
The 
Huffington 
Post 
points 
out 
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/05/ryanair-cuts-fuel-costs-
i_n_1405203.html], GoAir is far from the first airline to strive to have more female flight attendants.
 European budget airline Ryanair has done the same thing. It even encourages employees to lose weight with the 
lure that it may get them a ticket to appear in the airline's annual calendar. Ryanair also has reduced the amount of 
ice taken on planes and reduced the weight of its seats and carts.
 In 2010, Turkish Air gave 28 flight attendants six months to lose weight or they'd be fired. In 2010, Thai Airways 
also gave its employees six months to lose weight, providing them with required BMI and waist line measurements.
 Earlier this year, Nok Air said on its Facebook page that the ideal flight attendant "must have a weight in proportion 
with their height."
 What do you think? Is it OK for airlines to ask employees to slim down or opt for more female flight attendants to 
save on fuel? Or is it weight discrimination?

 Indian airline GoAir is--apparently--doing everything in its power to lighten its aircraft and improve fuel efficiency[1]. 
 Like (who else?) Ryanair before it[2], the airline has decided to only hire lightweight female flight attendants in the 
future, since males are--in general--heavier. Taking a page right out of Ryanair's playbook, the airline will also 
reduce the size of the in-flight magazine and the amount of water in their fleet's water tanks. 
 The airline currently employs about 130 male flight attendants, who will not be dismissed. Yet over the next seven 
years, GoAir plans to induct about 80 aircraft[3], and the expected 2,000 future cabin recruits will be female only.
 But will it actually work? An unnamed former executive with an Indian legacy carrier told the First Post, "There are 
umpteen number of things an airline can do to reduce weight[4]. For example, it can reduce the weight of food and 
water that is carried on board, use lighter cutlery, uplift only as much fuel as is necessary depending on flight 
duration etc. GoAir uses Airbus 320 fleet which means it would have, on an average, four crew members per 
domestic flight. If even one of them is male, does it make such a huge difference to aircraft weight?'
 The physicial characteristics of flight staff has been a concern of airlines in many past instances, too. In August 
2010, Turkish Airlines gave 28 flight attendants six months to lose weight or they'd be sacked[5]. In March 2011, 
Thai Airways provided employees with required BMI and waist line measurements and told them they has six 
months to lose the weight[6]. And finally, in March of this year, Nok Air released qualifications for its ideal cabin 
attendant on its Facebook page[7]. She "must have a weight in proportion with their height" and "must not wear 
dental braces," for example.

 Written by: Ryanair | Published in: Ryanair[1] Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (26th 
June) noted that the UK Competition Commission has extended the timetable for its investigation into Ryanair's 6 ½ 
year old minority shareholding in Aer Lingus from 11th July to 5th September, an extension of 8 weeks. Ryanair 
believes this extension has been caused by the UKCC's realisation that it has no case and has produced no 
evidence of any influence or lessening of competition arising from Ryanair's 6 ½ year old minority stake. 
Indeed the UKCC is bound by a legal duty of sincere cooperation to respect the European Commission's recent 
(Feb 2013) ruling that competition has intensified between Ryanair and Aer Lingus over the past 6 ½ years. As the 
UKCC's provisional thinking makes clear, its case now depends on three invented and factually inaccurate 
concerns which have been disproven by the past 6 ½ years of evidence as follows: A.The UKCC believes that 
Ryanair 'might' block an Aer Lingus rights issue, despite the written evidence it has received that Ryanair has 
repeatedly assured Aer Lingus that it will support any rights issue in order to prevent dilution. B.The UKCC believes 
that Ryanair 'might' block the sale of Heathrow slots, despite the fact that Ryanair recently (April 2013) supported 
the proposed sale by Aer Lingus of a pair of Heathrow slots to BA. However, this CC concern is obviously spurious 
given that the sale of Heathrow slots would reduce competition on the Dublin-London route and therefore the 
theoretical blocking of any such slot sale would promote, rather than lessen competition. C. The UK CC believes 
that Ryanair 'might' prevent Aer Lingus taking over another airline or another EU airline taking over Aer Lingus. 
Again this concern is refuted by the evidence of Ryanair's repeated statements (Sept 2011 and May 2012) that 
Ryanair would consider any proposal by another airline to acquire Aer Lingus and/or to acquire Ryanair's 
shareholding, despite the fact that Ryanair has received no such approaches from any other EU airline. Ryanair's 
Robin Kiely said; 'It's clear that the UKCC's case is falling apart. It has been forced to accept the EU's finding that 
competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified over the last 6 ½ years to the benefit of consumers, yet 
it has failed to explain why it's investigating a 6 ½ year old failed offer for Aer Lingus in circumstances where Aer 
Lingus accounts for less than 1% of UK air traffic and affects very few, if any, UK consumers. The fact that the 
UKCC is now desperately inventing bogus concerns which past and current evidence shows just how threadbare 
and weak the UKCC's case is. This was clearly a politically motivated reference by the UK's OFT, at the same time 
as they were ignoring BA's acquisition of British Midland, and Iberia's acquisition of Vueling. Given that neither the 
Irish nor the European Competition Authorities had any difficulty with Ryanair's 6½ year old minority stake, the 
UKCC should explain why they are wasting UK taxpayers' time or resources investigating a 6 ½ year old failed 
merger between two Irish airlines which the European Commission has recently blocked on the basis that 
competition has 'intensified' between the airlines. Ryanair believes that this extension is a ruse by the UKCC to try 
Ryanair 's Statement On UK Competition Commission Timetable Extension
to invent new concerns or strengthen its threadbare case against Ryanair's 6 ½ year old minority stake under which 
Ryanair clearly has had no material influence over Aer Lingus and which has not led to a 'lessening' but rather an 
'intensification' of competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Ryanair believes that the UKCC's provisional 
findings contained more jokes than a Monty Python script. Yesterday's announcement of this extension, merely 
confirms this fact, which is why the UKCC needs more time to try to invent bogus concerns or strengthen its 
threadbare case so that it doesn't have to suffer the indignity of reversing its provisional thinking or ultimately losing 
on appeal before the UK and European courts.'

 Japan 's budget airlines hit rough air

Jun 24, 2013 (NewsToday:http://feeds.feedblitz.com/prorssntb Delivered by Newstex)
 TOKYO: Japan's budget airlines have flown into turbulence with AirAsia's local carrier in danger of being grounded, 
but analysts say the popularity of discount flying should keep the fledgling sector in the sky.
 Earlier this month, Malaysia-based AirAsia warned it might pull the plug on its partnership with All Nippon Airways 
(ANA), citing management tensions.
 While details of the dispute remain unclear, AirAsia, the region's dominant budget carrier, said its Japanese 
business was 'facing some challenges attributed to a difference of opinion in management, most critically on the 
points of how to operate a low cost business and operating from Narita' airport.
 It added that AirAsia Japan was suffering from an 'inability to manage costs'.
 A key constraint on the country's budget carriers is that they have been shut out of Haneda airport, just a short 
train ride from downtown Tokyo and the staging point for the most profitable domestic routes, which are controlled 
by ANA and rival Japan Airlines (JAL).
 Flying out of Narita requires a one-hour train ride from the city centre, a long-standing headache for travellers 
including passengers with AirAsia Japan and Jetstar Japan, a joint venture between JAL and Australia's Qantas.
 The Japanese aviation industry has long been notorious for sky-high landing fees and fuel taxes, in a market that 
was controlled for decades by JAL and ANA, the country's two dominant carriers.
 Japanese travellers have become used to paying high fares, unlike flyers in other markets such as North America 
and Europe who could opt for heavily discounted rates on low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines or Ryanair.
 A Japanese no-frills carrier, Skymark Airlines, has struggled to offer the kind of heavily discounted fares seen 
overseas due to high operating costs.
 But a trio of new entrants have jumped into the market over the past couple of years, hoping to cash in on 
increases in airport capacity and steal away customers from both regional rivals and the dominant carriers, as well 
as another popular travel option in Japan: bullet trains.
 A third new entrant, Peach Aviation — jointly owned by First Eastern Aviation of Hong Kong, ANA, and a Japanese 
investment fund — announced its two-millionth passenger in May.
 AirAsia Japan, however, is in trouble less than two years after it got off the ground.
 The budget giant said it wanted to stay in the Japanese market and 'would not rule out any options to make this 
happen, including dissolution of the joint venture'.
 A report in Japan's leading Nikkei business daily said AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes reached an 
agreement on the dissolution after discussions with senior ANA officials.
 Japan 's budget airlines hit rough air
 For its part, ANA said that 'nothing has been decided', but vowed to continue flying a low-cost carrier out of Narita 
no matter what happens.
 Some observers see AirAsia partnering with another firm, possibly outside the aviation industry, with ANA merging 
its discount carrier service into its other venture Peach, which flies out of the smaller city of Osaka.
 'AirAsia will definitely come back to the Japanese market,' said Makiko Nakagawa, analyst with Fukoku Capital 
Management.
 'And when it does, it could be a big threat as its presence is quite significant across the region.'
 She added that the clash underscored how Japan's budget carriers have more growing pains ahead.
 'This case shows that Japan's low-cost carrier sector is only part way through its growth process,' she said.
 'But the market has potential. No countries have failed to succeed in this business. Japan is no exception.'
 Even so, the upstart carriers face more rough air ahead as diplomatic tensions between Tokyo and neighbours 
China and South Korea weigh on travel demand between the regional rivals.
 'The low-cost carriers cannot operate just with domestic flights alone. They must expand their revenue by mixing 
operations with international flights,' said Osuke Itazaki, senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
 'It is the survival of the fittest and so many players cannot co-exist in the market.'

 Boeing Company's (BA[1]) business arm Boeing Capital Corp. extended its business relationship with Australia's 
premier airline QantasLink by offering five additional 717 modern and efficient twinjets on lease. Currently, the 
airline operates a fleet of 13 twinjets across Australia.
 Boeing is expected to initiate delivery of the 717 aircrafts in late 2013 after upgrading the interiors to offer full 
business class experience and new in-flight entertainment services.
 The company also agreed to provide more 717 jets to Europe's startup carrier Volotea on lease. This would bring 
Volotea's total fleet to 15. In Feb 2012, Boeing and Volotea inked a multi-year deal for the delivery of an 
undisclosed number of 717 jets on lease.
 With the rise in passenger numbers, both QantasLink and Volotea expect Boeing's refurbished 717s to provide 
high class reliable services. The Boeing 717 is a short-haul, high frequency 100-passenger airline and has two 
class configurations with 106 seats.
 The flight deck features include an electronic instrument system, a dual flight management system, a central fault 
display system, and global positioning system. It also has category IIIb automatic landing capability for bad-weather 
operations and future air navigation systems.
 We note that Boeing picked up sizeable international contracts at the Paris Air Show. The resolution of the 787 
battery issue also removed a major overhang. The most recent contract in Paris came from Ryanair Holdings plc 
(RYAAY[2]) for the supply of 175 next generation 737-800 airplanes for $15.6 billion.
 Meanwhile, Boeing managed to secure a firm-fixed-price multi-year contract worth $3.4 billion for the construction 
of the remanufactured and new-build CH-47F cargo helicopters from the U.S Army. Boeing's multiple contract wins 
will ensure a stable future earnings stream.
 The increase in airline activities around the world has prompted an upswing in aircraft orders which will prove 
beneficial for the company. Currently, Boeing retains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 Good morning, AdLand. Here's what you need to know today:
 Dollar Shave Club might have started out on YouTube, but the company is now buying TV ads.[1] While VP of 
consumer marketing Adam Weber told Ad Age that the company was "very hesitant to go into television in the first 
place," it was partially convinced by Convertro's attributions metrics.
 In other TV ad news, according to Kantar Media, broadcast TV saw ad spending drop by 5.2%.[2]
 Patrick McGrath, past CEO and co-founder of Jordan Chase McGrath, died Saturday at 79[3] due to prostate 
cancer complications.
 A YouTube partnership helped Juicy Couture's website see an 18% increase in traffic.[4]
 Mad Men's finale had 2.7 million viewers[5]. That's the highest rated finale of the show's entire run.
 Some companies including Sky and pay-TV are no longer advertising on Facebook due to misogynistic content.[6]
 These are the 10 fastest growing ad spenders of 2012.[7]

 The 50th Paris Air Show wrapped up on Sunday[1], and there was a whole lot to see on the ground and in the air.
 We spent the week at the fairground at Le Bourget, the capital's first airport, which has been home to the show 
since it started in 1909 (the show is generally held every other year). 
 The 2013 version included celebrity appearances, amazing flight demonstrations, the debuts of some gorgeous 
and funny-looking aircraft, and excessive amounts of rain. A show worker cleaned the huge windows of the $65 
million Gulfstream G650 private jet.
Students from France's renowned engineering school École Polytechnique checked out the show.
A child took a seat in a fighter jet. 
Another participated in a rocket building contest.
A pilot with some impressive facial hair relaxed on the wing of a plane.
A Russian delegation took a look at the new helicopters the country brought to Paris.
One of them, the Ka-52 Alligator combat helicopter, put on an impressive flight demo.
Boeing's 787 Dreamliner made the crowds forget about its battery issues, cutting a graceful image against the sky.
A worker tinkered with a plane's propeller. 
One clever show-goer brought a lawn chair to relax in while watching flight demonstrations.
And these show workers took a break to see some impressive aerial moves.
One of the best was this steep takeoff by the enormous Airbus A380, in British Airways livery.
27 Awesome Moments From The 2013 Paris Air Show
Another Airbus ride, the A400M military transport aircraft, flew as well.
Italian aerospace company Piaggio Aero unveiled the strange-looking P.1HH HammerHead, Europe's largest 
unmanned aircraft system.
We toured the Gulfstream G650, and caught a minute of 'Les Miserables' playing on one of its big televisions.
Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro made an appearance.
So did French president Francois Hollande, who checked out a Thales heads-up display.
A wing walker showed off on an upside down Boeing Stearman biplane.
But Russia's incredibly loud Sukhoi SU-35 fighter jet got a lot more attention while it was in the air.
Qatar Airways brought its brand new 787 Dreamliner to the show, with an impressively equipped interior.
A show-goer checked out the cavernous interior of the Airbus A400M, a huge new military transport.
Heavy rain made regular appearances throughout the week, sending everyone running for cover.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary joked around with Boeing's Ray Conner after announcing his airline's $15 billion 
purchase of 175 737-8 jets.
Two Eurocopter Tiger H61 helicopters took to the skies as a pair.
But the most impressive aerial coordination came from the Patrouille de France, the air force's aerobatic on 
aerobatic demonstration team.
Boeing's Dreamliner turned some heads as it came in for a graceful landing.
But on one of the last days of the show, the long-awaited, brand new Airbus A350 flew over Le Bourget and stole 
the spotlight.
Now take a closer look at one of the stars of the Paris Air Show.

Orders top $100 bln as Ryanair gives Boeing a boost
Orders top $100 bln as Ryanair gives Boeing a boost

 Orders at the Paris Airshow surpassed $100 billion on Wednesday, as planemakers Boeing and Airbus cashed in 
on demand for fuel-efficient jets and growth in both budget carriers and emerging markets.
 Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, finalised an order for 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft worth around $15.6 
billion at list prices on day three of the aerospace industry's showcase event, the largest single order ever placed by 
a European airline with the US group.
 Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he was also working on an order for 200 or more of Boeing's next-
generation 737 MAX planes that could be concluded this year, potentially worth around $20 billion at list prices. Not 
to be overshadowed, Airbus sealed a long-awaited order for 25 of its lightweight, wide-body A350 planes from Air 
France-KLM worth $7.2 billion at list prices, as previously reported by Reuters. It also firmed up a deal worth $8.6 
billion for 30 more A350-900s from Singapore Airlines, taking the total on order from the carrier to 70.
 The A350, which made its maiden flight on Friday, is Airbus' answer to Boeing's popular carbon-composite 787 
Dreamliner, and the battle between the two models has been a key feature of the Paris show as the plane makers 
jostle to meet soaring demand for air travel in emerging markets, especially Asia and the Middle East. 'This show is 
about wide-bodies,' said Kelly Ortberg, president of Rockwell Collins, which supplies major systems to the 787 and 
A350. 'And really good news for wide-bodies.' Boeing bagged nearly $30 billion in orders as it launched the 787-10 
on Tuesday, a stretched variant of its high-tech Dreamliner.
 Wednesday's dealmaking took the order count for the show so far to more than $100 billion at list prices, although 
many of the agreements were provisional and most sizable deals are struck at a significant discount. Nonetheless, 
the activity confirmed plenty of work for civil aircraft manufacturers for years to come.
 Ryanair's O'Leary said the planned purchase of Boeing 737 MAX jets later this year would be 'all growth' and not 
replacements for aircraft currently in its all-Boeing fleet. If the order was not at least 200 planes, 'it wouldn't be worth 
doing,' he added, in typically forthright style. But some analysts took this with a pinch of salt. While Ryanair could 
afford to use a large MAX order to expand, it is not under pressure to buy next-generation jets, said Espirito Santo 
analyst Gerald Khoo, and will likely wait until prices are at a cyclical bottom to get the best deal.
 The 737 MAX is Boeing's answer to the Airbus A320neo, a new version of the European planemaker's best-selling 
model.

nearly 90% of fathers want to get away from their kids this Father's Day. Socks, ties and golf clubs are off the menu

just one in ten said they would be happy with the usual Father's Day gifts. Ryanair's survey asked 'what would you 
like to get this Father's Day?' and of our 1,000 dads: 88% wanted a weekend away from the kids 5% wanted a 
Father's Day meal in a restaurant 4% wanted a new golf club 2% wanted a tie 1% wanted socks

Day (16 June). Vouchers begin at just €25 and can be redeemed online to provide that well deserved break away - 
from the kids!
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said, 'Everyone knows fatherhood is the greatest gift any man could receive, but Ryanair 
asked 1,000 fathers what they would want for Father's Day and almost 90% wanted a weekend away from the kids 
rather than socks, ties or a new golf club. Ryanair gift vouchers start at just €25 and can be redeemed against travel 
on over 1,600 routes - perfect for that weekend away from the kids. Now all mums have to worry about is whether 
the dads invite them along!'

 Written by: Tran Thong | Published in: British Airways[1] FULL SCHEDULE RESUMES FOLLOWING FRENCH 
ATC STRIKE DISRUPTIONS Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (13 June) announced it 
had scheduled four extra flights on Friday 14th June between London Stansted and Malaga and Palma, in order to 
facilitate passengers who have had their flights cancelled followed the French ATC strike on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Up to 90,000 Ryanair passengers have been affected by the unwarranted two-day strike, which forced 
Ryanair to cancel over 600 flights and caused widespread disruption across Europe. Ryanair has resumed normal 
operations today with no further cancellations while it continues to re-accommodate passengers across Europe. 
Several Ryanair flights still have vacant seat capacity over the coming days and passengers are encouraged to visit 
www.ryanair.com[2] for further information. 
Ryanair sincerely apologises to passengers for any inconvenience caused by circumstances which are entirely 
beyond its control. Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: 'We have added four additional flights between London Stansted and 
Malaga and London Stansted and Palma, which will operate on Friday 14th June and passengers wishing to travel 
should contact their airport ticket desk or Ryanair call centre to move onto these additional flights. There is still 
some seat capacity available on flights operating over the coming days and we recommend that passengers check 
our website for new seat availability to their booked destination or other nearby Ryanair departure or arrival airports. 
Our schedule is running as normal and we have had no cancellations so far, although passengers should expect 
some delays at airports given the knock-on effect of 600 flight cancellations over the past two days. However, the 
danger remains that air traffic controllers, both in France and elsewhere, could stage further strikes, especially 
given the 'success' of their selfish and unwarranted strike action that they will have no doubt enjoyed, which caused 
misery to so many passengers. These air traffic controllers deliberately initiated industrial action at the busiest time 
of the year in order to cause maximum chaos, targeting Europe's holidaymakers, who have had their travel plans 
disrupted through no fault of theirs, or of Ryanair's. We again call on the EU Commission to remove the air traffic 
controllers' right to strike.'

 KUALA LUMPUR: Boeing and Ryanair on June 19, 2013 finalized a firm order for 175 Next-Generation 737-800 
airplanes valued at US$ 15.6 billion at list prices.
 The order, originally announced as a commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever aircraft order from a European 
airline. At a signing ceremony today at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of Ryanair, 
joined Ray Conner, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO, to finalize the historic deal.
 O'Leary flew into the air show on one of Ryanair's 303 737-800s, which bore a special livery celebrating the 
agreement.
 'Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who make great aircraft, and the 737-800 has been the foundation of Ryanair's 
recent successful growth due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability,' said O'Leary on a statement from 
Le Bourget, France.
 'These 175 new airplanes will enable us to lower costs and airfares even further. They provide Ryanair with the 
additional capacity to exploit substantial growth opportunities that now exist as many of Europe's flag and regional 
airlines are restructuring and are reducing their short-haul operations.'
 'We are delighted to finalize this order. It is a testament to the value the Next-Generation 737 family brings to 
Ryanair,' said Conner.
 'As the most efficient, reliable, large single-aisle airplane flying today, the Next-Generation 737 has been and will 
continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet. I could not be more proud to see the partnership between 
Ryanair and The Boeing Company extended for the years to come.'
 The Boeing 737-800 is the best-selling version of the successful Next-Generation 737 family. Known for its 
reliability, fuel efficiency and economical performance, the Next-Generation 737-800 is selected by leading carriers 
throughout the world because it provides operators the flexibility to serve a wide range of markets.
 Ryanair, which took delivery of its first 737-800 from Boeing in 1999, has the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in 
Europe, operating over 1,600 flights per day from 57 bases on 1,600 routes across 29 countries, connecting more 
than 180 destinations.
 Today's announcement brings the total number of 737s ordered to date to more than 11,000. Boeing currently has 
more than 3,400 unfilled orders for 737s.

OVER 100M RYANAIR PAX P.A. 3,000 NEW JOBS 
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC), today (19 June) finalised a firm order with Boeing for 175 new 
737-800 aircraft in a deal worth $15.6 billion at current list prices, which will allow Ryanair to grow its fleet to more 
than 400 aircraft, serving more than 100m passengers p.a.
 across Europe by the end of the delivery stream in FY 2019. 
The deal, which was originally announced as a commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever firm aircraft order 
from a European airline and the largest industrial order in the history of the Irish State and was concluded by 
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive, Ray Conner, at 
a ceremony today at the Paris Air Show. 
These 175 new Boeing aircraft will create more than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers at 
Ryanair's growing number of aircraft bases across Europe and will allow Ryanair to grow by about 5% p.a. over the 
next five years, taking Ryanair's traffic to over 100m p.a. passengers by March 2019. 
Ryanair's order will also sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in Boeing and its supplier companies and 
represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. jobs. The first of 
these new Boeing aircraft is due for delivery in September 2014 and a senior Ryanair working group is continuing to 
evaluate the benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, which enters service in 2017. 
Announcing the order, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, said: 
'Ryanair is pleased to finalise this firm order with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which will expand our 
fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, while allowing us to grow 
our traffic over the next 5 years to 100 million passengers p.a. 
Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who make great aircraft and the 737-800 has been the foundation of Ryanair's 
recent successful growth due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability. These 175 new airplanes will 
enable us to lower costs and airfares even further, thereby widening Ryanair's price leadership over all other 
airlines in Europe. They provide Ryanair with the additional capacity to exploit substantial growth opportunities that 
now exist as many of Europe's flag and regional airlines are restructuring and are reducing their short-haul 
operations. 
Ryanair Boeing Finalise Firm Order For 175 New 737-800 Aircraft
Ryanair operates the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in Europe, and this firm order for 175 aircraft will enable 
Ryanair to grow by offering more competition, lower prices, and better choice to passengers right across Europe. 
Ryanair is proud to be investing in high-quality US manufacturing and jobs.' 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said: "We are delighted to finalise this order, it is 
testament to the value that the Next-Generation 737 family brings to Ryanair. As the most efficient, reliable, large 
single-aisle airplane flying today, the Next-Generation 737 has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of the

 Passenger numbers rose at Manchester Airport across the month of May 2013, with 1.9m passing people through 
the doors.
 Figures showed almost an 11% rise in comparison with May last year, and took the airport over the 20m passenger 
mark during a 12 month period for the first time since May 2009.
 This news makes Manchester the fastest growing airport in the UK's top ten largest airports, with passenger 
numbers rising by 10.6% in May to mark the airport's 13th month of growth in a row.
 Performance improvements were attributed to continuing long haul destinations such as Dubai, Washington DC 
and Singapore, as well as the airport's efforts to position itself as the 'low cost airport of choice' for the North West 
region.
 Ken O'Toole, Chief Commercial Officer for MAG, owners of Manchester Airport, said: 'Reaching our target of 20 
million passengers ahead of schedule was testament to an increasing network of destinations and the hard work 
we've undertaken to highlight this message across the North of England.
 'That has included our recent 'Fly Manchester' campaigns to publicise the range of options here from carriers like 
United Airlines, American Airlines, Ryanair, Monarch, easyJet, Jet2.com, Germanwings and Norwegian to 
destinations across the globe.
 'We continue to see airlines bringing more routes online for passengers using Manchester with new destinations 
such as Aegean's service to the Greek capital, Athens, and Flybe adding their 19th destination from Manchester to 
Waterford in Ireland.
 'The start of June saw Egyptair launch a new five times a week service to Cairo, proving that airlines are continuing 
to recognise the opportunity that Manchester provides in serving the North of England market and we want to 
continue to support further growth from our airlines.'

 The European Union's emission trading scheme (ETS) as it applies to airlines is "nonsensical," Ryanair CEO 
Michael O'Leary said at a press conference at the Paris Air Show on Wednesday morning. 
 Through the ETS, the EU has put a cap on carbon emissions produced by flights[1] to or from European airports, in 
an effort to mitigate the industry's impact on the climate. Airlines are given tradeable allowances for CO2 emissions 
per year.
 Because China, the United States, and other "sensible economies," in O'Leary's view, have resisted 
participating[2], however, the rules are applied most stringently to airlines operating short-haul flights in Europe — 
including Ryanair.
 O'Leary accused "incompetent European politicians" of "taxing Europe's consumers so that they can do something 
about climate change." He is not a believer, he said, in the nefarious effects of a warming planet: "The climate is 
always going to change."
 "Only in Europe," he continued, "would you get that kind of stupidity."
 The notoriously outspoken CEO had not even been asked about the carbon taxing scheme. His tirade was sparked 
by a question about Ryanair's interest in green taxiing, a way to improve fuel efficiency in planes on runways. 
 O'Leary also shared his thoughts on how to cut unemployment in Europe's: through tourism[3].
 "If you got these idiots to get up off their asses and instead of trying to solve a nonexistent issues like climate 
change, why don't you actually get young people in Europe back to work?" he railed.
 "The best industry to do that is tourism. The best way to create tourism is actually to lower access costs, 
government taxes, airport fees, that kind of nonsense. Then stand back and let us create millions of jobs across the 
continent."
 At the press conference, O'Leary and Ray Conner of Boeing announced the budget carrier's order of 175 737-8 
jets[4], for $15 billion.

Jun 20, 2013 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 The Boeing Company (BA[1]) has received a firm order from Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[2]) 
to deliver 175 Next-Generation 737-800 airplanes at the Paris Air Show. This order, originally announced as a 
commitment in March, is worth $15.6 billion at list prices. This marks Boeing's largest European sale to date.
 Boeing has a long-standing alliance with Ryanair and aims to meet its commitments in terms of maintaining 
product standard along with delivery timing. Ryanair is one of the major operators of the 737-800 airplanes, having 
300 aircraft currently. The airline took delivery of its first 737-800 airplane from Boeing in 1999 and aims to boost its 
fleet size to more than 400 aircraft with a capacity to serve over 100 million customers across Europe every year.
 The Boeing Next-Generation 737-800 airplanes came into service on Sep 5, 1994. This model continues to be a 
pillar of strength for Boeing in the commercial airplane sector. Steady demand for this model is primarily driven by 
fuel efficiency and lower operating costs as compared to other models. The single-aisle aircraft can accommodate 
162-189 passengers and can fly approximately 3,000 nautical miles (3,452.3 miles).
 Ryanair is also working on another order comprising about 200 Boeing 737-MAX jets. The deal is likely to be 
sealed within a year and has a potential value of around $20 billion at list prices.
 Meanwhile, the commercial aircraft manufacturer has clinched a deal with aircraft leasing company CIT Aerospace 
for 30 of its new generation 737-MAX 8 jets. The contract brings to the fore the popularity of the fuel-efficient short-
haul aircraft at the Paris Air Show. The 737-MAX 8 planes have a list price of $100.5 million.
 The 737 MAX uses technologically advanced CFM International LEAP-1B engines helping to deliver the highest 
efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. Airlines that operate the 737 MAX will 
witness a 13% fuel-use improvement over most fuel-efficient single-aisle airplanes today. It also has an 8% 
operating cost per seat advantage over tomorrow's competition. First deliveries of the MAX are expected in 2017.
 The Paris Show has definitely brought in big orders for Boeing. The company has also sealed a deal with Oman Air 
for five Boeing Next-Generation 737-900ER airplanes. The order is worth of $473 million at current list prices.
 The 737-900ER provides all the benefits of the Next-Generation 737 family with greater seating capacity. This deal 
makes Oman Air a leading customer in the Arabian Gulf region to order 737-900ERs. Presently, the airline operates 
15 Boeing Next-Generation 737-800s and 2 737-700s and will have a backlog of 6 737-800s and 5 737-900ERs 
with the latest contract. The airline also has 6 Boeing 787-8s on order.
 Chicago-based Boeing Company is a premier jet aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest defense contractors 
in the U.S. Despite the battery issue related to 787-8 that resulted in the grounding of the aircraft, Boeing is flooded 
with orders because of the sheer fact that its aircrafts are more fuel efficient. This not only reduces cost per mile but 
Boeing Lands with More Orders in Paris - Analyst Blog
also cuts pollution levels. Moreover, these aircrafts are right-sized for many long-haul markets. These multi-billion 
dollar orders will likely act as a catalyst to growth.

Budget Carrier Ryanair Just Spent $15 Billion On 175 Boeing Jets, And It's Planning To Order A Lot More
Budget Carrier Ryanair Just Spent $15 Billion On 175 Boeing Jets, And It's 
Planning To Order A Lot More

 European ultra low-cost carrier Ryanair finalized an order for 175 Boeing 737-800 jets, the two companies 
announced this morning at the Paris Air Show[1].
 The deal is worth $15.6 billion, and is Boeing's largest European sale to date.
 It will grow Ryanair's fleet from 300 planes at the moment to 400 by the summer of 2018. The rest of the new 737s 
will replace current jets the carrier will retire. 
 That new capacity is needed because Ryanair plans to accommodate 100 million passengers per year five years 
from now, a 25% jump over its current numbers, CEO Michael O'Leary said at the press conference.
 The cheap airline is notorious for considering anything it can to cut costs and fit more seats into its planes, bigger 
doors[2] that would speed up boarding to eliminating seatbelts[3] (neither will happen anytime soon). Naturally, 
Ryanair's 737-800s will be laid out to fit the maximum 189 passengers on board.
 O'Leary also said Ryanair is working on another order of about 200 Boeing 737-MAX jets, likely to be concluded 
within a year. That would be for at least 200 planes, or "it wouldn't be worth doing," he said.
 Asked in Paris if he had looked into buying the Airbus A320 NEO, a MAX competitor, O'Leary said Ryanair gave it 
"serious consideration." But the decision came down to the seat count: The Airbus holds nine fewer passengers 
than the Boeing, although its performance numbers are similar. The extra seats are what matters.
 "You work out that maths...it would be a million bucks a year," he said. 
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner added that the 737-800 offers better maintenance 
and operating costs, but O'Leary countered, "I don't necessarily agree with that. I think it's inevitable, each 
manufacturer says that they do slightly better. I think where they'll finish up is that on fuel burn, the MAX and the 
NEO will be pretty similar."
 "But what's compelling from the operator and the owner is that the MAX has more seats," O'Leary added. 
 Operating costs and reliability do play a role, O'Leary said, adding "Boeing make great aircraft, Boeing have always 
made great aircraft, and Ryanair, which I think has the, certainly has the highest technical reliability, and is the most 
on time major airline in Europe, none of that would be possible without a great aircraft like the Boeing 737-800."

 This week, the International Air Transport Association[1] (IATA) released the figures of the top one hundred airlines 
ranked by traffic. According to their website, 'Airlines are ranked in terms of international, domestic and total 
scheduled passenger numbers and passenger-kilometres.'
 Ryanair[2], the notoriously controversial low-cost carrier, topped the list of busiest international airlines, having 
carried nearly 80 million passengers across borders last year. The airline's CEO, Michael O'Leary, is seemingly 
constantly in the news for giving great sound bites. He's been quoted saying that "seatbelts don't matter,[3]" that he 
should be paid more,[4] and has called passengers "idiots"[5].
 In terms of domestic travel, Southwest Airlines[6], Delta Air Lines[7], China Southern Airlines[8], United Airlines[9], 
and China Eastern Airlines[10] formed the top five busiest airlines at roughly 112 million, 95 million, 79 million and 
68 million scheduled passengers carried in 2012, respectively. American Airlines[11] and US Airways[12] followed 
closely behind, claiming the 6th and 7th spots.

Regional countries to lobby London on airline passenger duty tax

 BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: Caribbean diplomats in the United Kingdom (UK) are gearing up to lobby the British 
government for an ease in the airline passenger duty (APD), a tax which Caribbean countries say seriously affect 
their tourism industries.
 Tourism and International Transport Minister Richard Sealy said the Caribbean diplomats have secured £40,000 
(One British pound = US$1.57 cents) to assist them in this effort.
 Sealy, who recently visited the United Kingdom to the UK to meet with stakeholders in the tourism industry, said 
the funds were sourced from a UK-based Jamaican Building Society to assist the High Commissioners in their fight.
 He also said the APD Steering Group of which Barbados' High Commissioner was a member, was fully on board 
with the initiative.
 'High Commissioner (Hugh) Arthur is fully engaged along with the High Commissioners from the Cooperative 
Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St. Lucia, among others, who are definitely 
keen and re-energised to engage the British Government. They will also be a £40,000 public campaign as part of 
the effort,' he added.
 The APD, instituted in 1994, is a British environmental tax aimed at offsetting aviation's carbon footprint. In its initial 
stage, it was set at £5 (US$7.85) per person.
 Regional governments have been lobbying London to remove the tax, which they said negatively affect the growth 
of the tourism industry since the Caribbean has been placed in a band that makes travel to the region much more 
expensive than travelling from London to the United States.
 Last year, a number of leading international airlines, including British Airways, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic 
urged Osborne to suspend the planned APD pending the outcome of an independent study of the economic effects 
of such a tax rise.
 The airlines said that the eight per cent increase introduced in April last year would reduce passenger numbers and 
hinder the UK's economic recovery.
 They said that as a result of the increase, a family of four flying from the UK to the Caribbean would have to pay 
close to £400 in taxes. In 2005 such a family would have paid a total of £80 in taxes.
 Sealy also said it was 'good to hear' that the region was 'making noise' on the APD and its impact on travellers.
 'We don't expect the APD to go away but at the same time, we can't just go silent on the issue and we have to 
enlist some more partners because this thing is much larger than a tourism issue,' he added.
Regional countries to lobby London on airline passenger duty tax
 While commending the High Commissioners for taking the lead in this effort , Sealy said that the West Indian and 
immigrant populations, who played an integral role in the development of the British economy, were affected by the 
APD.
 'They (British Government) cannot just ignore the cries from these people that are performing a significant part of 
the lifeblood of their nation.
 'It is important from a tourism point of view especially for Barbados, because (Britain) is our major source market, 
but it is also important for those many Barbadians and others who are living in that society who are affected want to 
come home to visit a sick relative or to attend a funeral.'
 'I am not saying that the ticket should be tax free, but it (the taxes) should be within reach,'. Sealy said.

 Try as they might, airlines can't seem to live up to Hollywood standards of beauty, it seems. 
 Ryanair releases their "sexy" calendar every year for charity[1], Nok Airlines had Maxim models pose for a 
calendar, too[2] and Virgin Atlantic's flight attendants were named the hottest in the skies[3]. 
 Yet a recent American Airlines survey, which polled 1,000 U.K. residents, 22.5% of respondents would want 
George Clooney to be their flight attendant (he edged out Prince Harry[4], who came in with 21.4% of the votes). As 
for the ladies, 22% voted Marilyn Monroe as their dream flight attendant (Audrey Hepburn came in second with 
20%, Jennifer Aniston with 18% and Kate Middleton with 17.1%).

It's no secret that, even as they fight their never-ending battle with real fakes for the hearts [and pockets, adds 
Merpel] of consumers, brand owners continue to tussle with ever-present and generally unwelcome competition 
from lookalikes. This battle has not just been through the courts: it has been on the policy and business agenda for 
at least two decades. Well-known brands, and brand-owners' groups, have long advocated specific and adequate 
protection against lookalikes under United Kingdom law, particularly in the context of possible business-to-business 
harm. In response, successive governments have replied with the same refrain: "first show us the evidence
 'The Impact of Lookalikes', research report that commissioned by the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office 
(IPO), attempts to exhaust the topic, providing a mass of data, cases and even a new set of working definitions. At 
400 pages[1] it will pretty well exhaust your Ryanair hand-luggage too. You can download it here, but the IPO 
advises against printing it out in case you exhaust your printer cartridge.
1.The impact of lookalikes: main report[2] (142 pages)
2 The impact of lookalikes: annexes I to III[3] (47 pages)
3. The impact of lookalikes: appendices A-F[4] (81 pages)
4. The impact of lookalikes: appendices G-J [5](125 pages) The legal analysis is summed up in just three succinct 
paragraphs:
22. In none of the three jurisdictions examined - the UK, Germany and the United States - was the legal position of 
lookalikes particularly clear. Nevertheless, at the interim stage, there is a perception that a claimant is more likely to 
be successful in the favourable German forum than in either of the other two countries [the same perception that 
Germany is a favourable jurisdiction may be gleaned from trade mark law and might be something to do with the 
notion of confusion being traditionally seen as a matter of fact in the US and UK but as a matter of law in Germany]. 
23. It is probable that the prevention of certain lookalikes is within the scope of the Unfair Commercial Practices 
Directive (2005/29/EC).[This Kat concurs, having sought to make this point in the past] Under this assumption, the 
United Kingdom may not be free to legislate to further prevent lookalikes save in business-to-business transactions. 
However, it would also mean that certain lookalikes are already unlawful under the Consumer Protection from 
Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. 
24. Accordingly, if there is a restriction on legislation in relation to lookalikes, a private right of action under the 
Consumer Protection from Trading Regulations 2008 would be permitted under the Unfair Commercial Practices 
Directive. As for the rest, the IPKat was treated to a handy summary from law firm Wragge which states, inter alia:
Once you've seen one, you've seen them all: but this report on lookalikes is different
• Some consumers do believe that similar looking products have similar characteristics and originate form a similar 
source; [while this is not exactly news, it's comforting to know that this project has reached such a conclusion. If it 
hadn't, we'd start worrying about the rest of it]
• A high number of consumers felt disadvantaged by the accidental purchase of a lookalike, but a substantial 
number saw it as an advantage; [this looks like the 'brand promise versus bargain price' divide]
• Only in a limited number of categories was there an association between a reduction in the sales of the brand 
leader and an increase in the sale of lookalikes; and [showing the power of brand loyalty, or do consumers buy the 
brand leader because they confuse it with the lookalike ...?]
• There is a fine line between confusing packaging and the use of "generic cues" to signal to customers. [true, but 
what makes generic cues generic in the first place? Often it's the investment by the brand owners]
The research suggests a statutory definition of a lookalike as "good which by virtue of their name, shape, colour, 
packaging or labelling or any combination thereof, are similar in overall appearance to the goods; but excluding any 
of those things where they are descriptive, functional or commonplace." [adopting a definition might stop people 
arguing over the definition -- but it's only really important if a right is attached to it] The IPO's report is far too long 
for this Kat to digest immediately, so he appreciates readers' comments and constructive criticisms.

 Filed under: Europe[1], France[2], Airlines[3], Transportation[4], Airports[5], News[6] [ Image removed: air traffic 
controller ]Mark Brouwer The French air traffic controller union is on strike[7] and will soon be followed by those of 
nine other European nations, the BBC reports.
 The strike is being launched in protest against European Union plans to form regional blocs[8] for air traffic control. 
It says this will be more efficient than the current national system and will reduce flight distances. The unions say it 
reduces national sovereignty and is a step towards privatization. They also say it would adversely affect their 
working conditions and flight safety.
 Flights to and from France are already being affected, with easyJet, Ryanair, British Airways, and Lufthansa the 
hardest hit. Tomorrow, air traffic controllers in the following countries will go on strike: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Slovakia.
 France will remain on strike tomorrow. RTÉ News reports[9] that France's civil aviation authority has requested that 
airlines cancel half their scheduled flights to Paris, Lyon, Nice, Marseilles, Toulouse, and Bordeaux. Europe Hit By

 We're a bit airline-obsessed here at HuffPost Travel. We love to follow airlines' uniforms[1], new logos (like 
American's[2], which was revealed in January), airplanes[3], hell, even Ryanair's crazy flight attendant calendars[4] 
(and Nok Air's[5], too). We especially love vintage photos of flying's glory days[6]. 
 So we were particularly thrilled when we came upon Just The Flight's infographic of airline logos throughout the 
years. The site takes a look at the logos of some 17 airlines over the past 90 years. It's a fun trip down memory 
lane. Check it out below. And for more on the days of yore, take a look at some awesome vintage flying shots 
below.

 The Dow (^DJI) fell below 15,000, dropping by triple digits in its worst day in six weeks, which was no way to honor 
the Father of Economics on his birthday[1]. (Oddly, on the English side of Hadrian's Wall, John Maynard Keynes[2] 
also entered the world on June 5.) Adding insult to injury for Adam Smith, who like any thrifty Scot absolutely 
abhorred losing money, the game his ancestors invented suffered a grievous blow as Callaway Golf (ELY) tumbled 
2.54% on an analyst downgrade[3].
 Elsewhere Latvia got the green light to enter the eurozone[4], though one wonders why on Earth it would want to. 
Continental integration has thus far brought nothing but an influx of boozy Brit bachelor parties[5] to its capital, 
where drunken tourists relieve themselves on Riga's Freedom Monument. Adding insult to injury for the Baltic 
country, Ryanair (OTCMKTS:RYAAY[6]) hit the highest level in its history yesterday. The budget carrier has 
encouraged cross-border travel even as its fee to pee proposals[7] resulted in hordes of inebriated Englishmen 
waiting until arrival to evacuate their bladders.
 Today's quarterly earnings announcements include Ann Inc. (ANN), Ciena (CIEN), Cooper Companies (COO), 
Dominion Diamond (DDC), Fairway Group (FWM), Jiayuan.com (DATE), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Quiksilver (ZQK), 
and Vail Resorts (MTN).
Costco (COST): COST is covered with a Buy at Sterne Agee. Shares in the warehouse-club chain, which reported 
its May same-store-sales this morning, are currently trading higher.
Emeritus Corp. (ESC): Goldman Sachs has a new Neutral on the operator of long-term care facilities.
Enbridge Inc. (ENB): The energy outfit is assigned an Outperform at Macquarie.
ExOne (XONE): XONE gets picked up with a Buy recommendation, and $55 price objective, at Canaccord Genuity.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper Gold (FCX): The commodity company is a fresh Buy at Jefferies
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR): Shares are set an Outperform and $95 price objective at Imperial 
Capital, which expresses optimism over its industry-leading key Keurig product.
Haemonetics (HAE): JMP Securities has an Outperform on HAE.
Medicines Co (MDCO): Shares are established with an Overweight at Piper Jaffray.
Mohawk (MHK): Barclays begins coverage at Overweight.
Retailers: Sterne Agee begins Buys on Dollar Tree (DLTR), JC Penney (JCP), Macy's (M), and Nordstrom (JWN). It 
has new Neutrals on Dollar General (DG), Family Dollar (FDO), Kohl's Corp. (KSS), and Saks Inc. (SKS).

 Airlines will charge you for pretty much anything these days. 
 In an effort to find even more revenue, some European full-service carriers are taking fine dining to economy class. 
From Bloomberg[1]:
 Air France (AF) is tempting economy-class customers with paid-for meal upgrades featuring foie gras terrine, and 
Austrian Airlines has Wiener schnitzel and sushi among its 15-euro ($19.60) in-flight nourishments.
 AF's menu-upgraded duck confit with mushrooms and sauteed potatoes (with Opera cake for dessert) will run you 
18 euros.
 "Ancillary sales" on everything from foie gras to overhead bin-space have skyrocketed to $36 billion since 2007, or 
5 percent of what airlines earned last year, an expert told Bloomberg.
 For all the tired jokes about its taste, airline food used to come gratis. The industry has been forced to adapt now 
that low-cost airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet have successfully conditioned passengers to pay for everything.

 By: Bloomberg News
 SINGAPORE Airlines Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong watched budget airlines in neighboring 
Indonesia and Malaysia order some 800 aircraft in the two-and-a-half years he has been at the helm.
 With the third-highest cash reserves among airlines globally, Goh responded last week with a record $17-billion 
purchase. Singapore Air, including its affiliates, now has $46 billion of aircraft orders with Airbus SAS and Boeing 
Co.
 The airline needs more planes as Malaysia-based AirAsia Bhd. and Indonesia's PT Lion Mentari Airlines wean 
away budget travelers as Asia's economic growth spurs travel. With competition to lure bankers in the city-state 
increasing from Middle East carriers, Goh has revamped his first- and business-class offerings, undeterred by a 31-
percent drop in stock price during his tenure and Wall Street's downsizing.
 'Goh is taking the right step forward,' said Timothy Ross, head of Asia-Pacific transport at Credit Suisse AG in 
Singapore. 'They need to look at what they do well, and that is medium- to long-haul premium passenger travel. 
These orders play to that strength.'
 Singapore Air on May 30 announced orders for 30 of the Boeing 787-10X variant, 30 Airbus A350-900s and an 
option for 20 more that it may choose to convert to a larger A350-1000 variant, according to a statement. It's the 
first order for the stretched version of Boeing's Dreamliner.
 'These new aircraft will provide opportunities to grow and renew our fleet and enhance our network,' Goh, 49, said 
in the statement. 'They demonstrate our commitment to the Singapore hub and our confidence in the future for 
premium full-service travel.'
 The carrier had $4.08 billion of cash and near cash as of end March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
That lagged behind Air France-KLM Group and Ryanair Holdings Plc.
 Singapore Air's deal comes after AirAsia, the region's biggest low-fare carrier, and Lion Air ordered hundreds of 
single-aisle aircraft targeting budget-conscious flyers across Asia. In March, Lion Air agreed with Airbus to buy 234 
planes worth $24 billion, building on a 230-plane, $22.4 billion order it gave Boeing less than two years back.
 In 2011 AirAsia ordered 200 Airbus A320neo aircraft valued at $18 billion. In December, the carrier placed an order 
for 100 additional A320s.
 Low-fare airlines control 30 percent of seat capacity at Singapore, compared with almost zero a decade ago, 
according to the website of CAPA Centre for Aviation, which advises airlines.
 Singapore Air buys planes to take on discount carriers
 Competition is increasing for Singapore Air in the business-class and first-class segments as well with Sydney-
based Qantas Airways Ltd. and Dubai-based Emirates forming an alliance. Emirates, the world's biggest airline by 
international traffic, said in January it's studying 'ways and means' to accommodate an order for 30 more A380s.
 'It's not getting any easier,' said CAPA's Singapore-based analyst Brendan Sobie. 'Singapore Air recognizes it 
needs to continue to invest in upgrading its product, and they have the cash to respond.'
 Excluding last week's orders, Singapore Air already had an order book comprising five A380-800s, 13 A330-300s, 
eight 777-300ERs and 40 A350-900s, according to the airline. Its unit SilkAir has an order for 54 Boeing 737s and is 
awaiting delivery of one Airbus A320. Scoot, the long-haul budget airline owned by carrier, has an additional 20 
787-900s on order.
 'We don't compete by having the most aircraft on order with manufacturers,' Singapore Air spokesman Nicholas 
Ionides said in an e-mail. 'We compete by providing the highest quality products and services over an extensive 
network.'
 Goh took charge in January 2011 from Chew Choon Seng, as the global airline industry confronted the world's 
worst recession in six decades. Since then, he has restructured the carrier, known for its iconic 'Singapore Girl' 
advertising campaigns.
 He sold the carrier's 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. to Delta Airlines Inc. for $360 million in 
December and took a bet on Australia by buying a stake in Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. Singapore Air began 
Scoot's flights in June last year and subscribed in March to a fund-raising plan of short-haul budget airline Tiger 
Airways Holdings Ltd., in which it's the largest shareholder.

 The Boeing Company (BA[1]) received an order from an affiliate of Britain's Thomson Airways, TUI Travel, for the 
delivery of 60 737 MAX jets with the option of supplying a further 90 of the fuel-efficient planes.
 The 737 MAX, a narrow body plane, is the newest offering from Boeing designed to compete with its close rival 
Airbus' A320 neo. The order is expected to fetch Boeing roughly $6.09 billion.
 The latest 737 MAX, power-driven by CFM International's LEAP-1B engines, burns 13% less fuel compared to 
older models. Production for these models is expected to commence in 2015 with delivery slated to begin from 
2017. However, TUI Travel expects deliveries between Jan 2018 and Mar 2023.
 With the company benefiting from economies of scale that led to reduction in per unit research and development 
cost, production of the 737 planes is expected to move north. Also, with the 787 battery issue been put to rest, 
Boeing expects production of this plane to accelerate too. It recently clinched a delivery order of 30 787 planes from 
Singapore Airlines.
 Contract flows for Boeing has been consistent in spite of the 787 controversy. In Mar 2013, the company booked 
an order for supplying 175 single aisle 737's from Ireland-based budget airline Ryanair Holdings plc. (RYAAY[2]).
 We expect Boeing to fly high on the strength of its net orders of 428 planes as on May 28, 2013. The company 
delivered a total of 181 planes through Apr 2013. We believe Boeing is close to achieving its targeted delivery 
range of 635-435 planes with the settling of the 787 matter.
 Of late, business from emerging countries like India and China look encouraging given the rise in airline activities. 
China resumed its order for Boeing's planes this month while the company expects India to be another major 
possible client.
 However, the defense budget headwinds would continue to act as a deterrent to growth. Boeing currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 Packing requires practicality: Not only must you carefully plot what items to bring, but you must also strategically 
organize them into one compact carry-on. With steep checked-baggage fees increasing already lofty flight costs, 
experienced globetrotters often suggest stripping down to the absolute essentials in order to hold on to some 
dough. Add the burden of shouldering a bulky bag along spread out terminal walkways and you can see why savvy 
travelers are taking advantage of smart, minimalist packing.
 While carrying less cargo certainly has its benefits, even the most seasoned travelers agonize over how to limit 
excess baggage. But never fear: No matter where you're headed, these nine handy techniques will help you pack 
as efficiently as possible for your next trip.
Highways Agency / Flickr[1]
 [In Pictures: How to Pack Light[2]]
 Size Up Your Carry-On
 You'll run the risk of paying a hefty sum if your bag exceeds your carrier's size requirements for carry-on luggage. 
Before you consider which particular suitcase to take, check your airline's carry-on baggage restrictions to avoid 
extra fees. Carry-on bag size dimensions vary by airline. Most domestic carriers allow you to bring luggage as large 
as 45 linear inches (the total length, width and height of a bag) on board; however, some smaller international 
airlines like Ryanair impose much stricter dimensions. By opting for a suitcase that doesn't exceed 20 inches in 
length or 20 pounds fully packed, you should have no problem boarding domestic carriers. New, cutting-edge 
luggage designs are rolled out every year, but you should stick to the style that suits you. A roll-aboard with soft 
sides that can be easily laid into an overhead bin allows you to breeze through the terminal on wheels, while a 
lightweight duffel bag allows you to traverse a variety of terrains.
 Make a Checklist 
 It may seem like a no-brainer, but making a packing list forces you to differentiate between what's necessary and 
what's not. Write down exactly how many shirts, pants and shoes you will need, taking into account the climate of 
your destination. Also, don't forget to use logical numbers to determine necessary clothing -- for example, the 
number of shirts you bring probably shouldn't exceed the number of days you'll be away. And while you're at it, pare 
down your list once more if you'll be able to wash garments on your trip. After you've thoughtfully calculated what to 
bring, cross off each item as you lay it next to your bag, and ignore the urge to add any extra articles of clothing at 
the last minute.
 Stay Neutral
How to Pack Light: 9 Tips to Lighten Your Load
 A general rule of thumb for packing light is selecting neutral shades. If you're traveling on business, bring along 
shirts, pants and blazers that complement each other in whites, blacks and browns. If basics aren't really your style, 
pick an eye-catching color like red and work around it. Another tip: If you're traveling for work, bring along a crisp, 
white-collared shirt. You'll find it's easy to mix and match pieces on the road. Plus, you'll allow yourself extra room 
for packing casual clothing and heavier items like shoes.
 [See: http://travel.usnews.com/features/Snakes_on_a_Plane/Snakes on a Plane?]
 Pack Ahead of Time 
 It probably goes without saying, but if you pack at least one day prior to your departure, you'll be far less likely to 
hastily insert extras that aren't necessary. Allow yourself enough time to assess the pieces you need. You should 
lay all your items in a way that allows you to see everything -- this will help you lighten your load and prevent you 
from bringing that extra bathing suit or pair of shoes that you could probably do without. Plus, by starting the 
packing process early, you'll give yourself enough leeway to thoughtfully pack your bag instead of trying to balance 
stuffing your suitcase with scrambling to get to the airport on time.
 Learn to Layer
 If you're headed somewhere cold, you're going to need to pile on the layers. But instead of stacking a hefty winter 
jacket into your carry-on, pack thermal gear and thin sweaters. Another trick for keeping your suitcase slim: Wear 
your bulkiest items (such as a long sleeve shirt or your heavy coat) on the plane. If you're too warm, you can always 
stow away your extra layers in an overhead bin.
 Compress and Conserve
 What's the secret to bundling it all in? Compiling your bulkiest items into compression packing bags. These helpful 
bags allow more room for your clothes and other items by reducing excess air. Spacepak Bags available from Flight 
001 or Space Bags from Ziploc are ideal if you're packing for a longer trip; these bags allow you to fit bulkier items 
into a smaller bag. If your trip doesn't require clunky articles of clothing, skip the space bag and tuck accessories 
and smaller necessities into larger items. Stuff socks, underwear and belts inside running shoes to save space.
 [See:            http://travel.usnews.com/features/Best_Travel_Apps_Under_3/Best Travel Apps Under $3]
 Shoe It In
 Before you toss any shoes inside your bag, ask yourself one question: "Do I really need these?" Many frequent 
travelers agree that two or three pairs of shoes -- at most -- should suffice. Whether you're traveling on business or 
for pleasure, you can probably make do with one pair of dressier footwear and another more casual pair. (You'll 
also save room in your bag by wearing your bulkiest shoes on the plane.) Once you've decided which shoes to 
bring, be sure to place them in your suitcase first and to the side as shoes tend to take up a lot of room. By doing 
so, you'll not only maximize your space, but also evenly distribute your heaviest items.
 Roll It Up
 Instead of folding, start rolling. You'll be surprised how much room you'll save if you roll your clothing instead of 
laying it out flat. Stack the bulkiest items, such as pants and sweaters, into the corners of your bag (after shoes, of 
course) to distribute weight evenly, and then continue compiling rolled items at the center of your bag. Pack 
everything snugly to conserve as much space as possible. If you're looking to keep your formalwear wrinkle-free, 
your best bet is folding rather than rolling. You'll want to place your dress wear into a dry-cleaner bag or insert a 
piece of tissue paper between each article to prevent extra creases and wrinkles in-transit. All rolled items should 
be placed at the bottom of your bag, with dressier attire arranged neatly and tightly at the top of your suitcase.
 Save the Lightest Items for Last
 Once you've bundled the bulkiest articles of clothing inside your carry-on, it's time to stow lighter items like 
toiletries. And with the Transportation Security Administration adhering to 3-ounce liquid restrictions, you're going to 
have to pare down to the essentials to stay within size requirements. Opt for a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner 
or a shampoo bar that can double as soap. You may purchase specific toiletries on the road or rely on hotel 
shampoo bottles to save extra space, too. After you've trimmed down your toiletry kit, place it on top of your bag so 
it's within easy reach at security checkpoints. You'll also need to reduce your tech gear to the essential travel tools: 
Must-haves include your cellphone, camera, headphones, chargers and laptop or tablet (if you're planning to work 
while on the road). Remember that you'll need to remove these items along with your toiletries at the TSA 
checkpoint.

the end of March compared with net profit of 560.4 million euros in 2011/12.
 Ryanair expects the company's traffic to grow by 3.0 percent to 81.5 million passengers in 2013/14, it added in an 
earnings statement.

 General Motors rises above
 IPO price
 Shares of General Motors Company (GM) hit new 52-week high of $33.77 on May 17, which is above its previous 
level of $32.44 as well as the Initial Public Offering (:IPO) price of $33.00 (held in Nov 2010) for the first time since 
May 4, 2011.
 GM's last closing price was $33.42, which represented a solid one-year return of 54.7 per cent and year-to-date 
return of 14.7 per cent. The world's second largest automaker (by sales volume) has a market cap of $45.7 billion. 
Average volume of shares traded over the last three months stood at approximately 11,419.4K.
 Shares of the company started escalating following its announcement of revival plan in Europe and U.S. Treasury 
department's announcement of selling a significant stake in the company as well as improvements in the U.S. and 
Chinese markets.
 Last month, Chairman and CEO of GM, Dan Akerson, promised to invest €4 billion ($5.2 billion) in its European 
operation Opel without revealing any plan to close down plants or other specific measures in order to boost 
 Ryanair announces slight rise in annual profits
earnings. Opel plans to launch 23 new models and 13 new engines within 2016 and develop a small car platform 
with French partner PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUGY).
 In the same month, the U.S. Treasury Department revealed that it sold $621 million worth of GM common stock in 
March, recovering $30.4 billion of the $49.5 billion bailout fund received by GM. The U.S. Treasury intends to sell 
the remaining 16 per cent stake in GM early 2014. The rising stock price would definitely help the government 
recovering its bailout fund as much as possible.
 GM reported a 28.0 per cent fall in earnings to 67 cents per share in the first quarter of the year from 93 cents in 
the same quarter of 2012 (all excluding special items) due to lower earnings generated from the company's all 
geographic operations except Europe. Despite this, the automaker's earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate by 11 cents per share.
 Revenues in the quarter slid 2.4 per cent to $36.9 billion, despite a 3.6 per cent rise in retail unit sales to 2.4 million 
vehicles globally. Nevertheless, it was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.4 billion.
 General Motors is gearing up for more than 40 major vehicle launches in 2013 across the globe in order to drive 
sales and revenues. In addition, the company expects its European results will improve further based on its cost 
reduction measures.
 Last month, GM's sales increased 11.4 per cent to 237,646 vehicles, driven by strong sales of its all four brands 
and especially Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Sales increased 11 per cent for Chevrolet, 34 per cent for Cadillac, 
11 per cent for Buick and 7 per cent for GMC. Silverado sales escalated 28 per cent to 39,395 units.
 GM's sales were helped by the recovering auto market in the U.S. as well as by the unpopularity of the Japanese 
brands in China due to a political conflict between China and Japan.
 Auto sales in the U.S. rose 3.5 per cent to 14.92 million vehicles in April. Total vehicle sales went up 8.5 per cent to 
1.29 million vehicles in the month. In China, General Motors and its Chinese joint venture partners sold 261,870 
vehicles in the month, up 15.3 per cent from Apr 2012.
 Currently, shares of GM retain a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While we remain on the sidelines about General Motors, 
stocks that are currently performing well in the broader auto industry include Visteon Corp. (VC) and Denso Corp. 
(DNZOY) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 PALPA works out fuel conservation plan
PALPA works out fuel conservation plan

 By: IQBAL MIRZA
 KARACHI: Taking lead from the calculation of American Airlines that 'if you removed just one olive from every 
salad served to passengers, nobody would notice, and the airline would save US $100,000 a year,' Pakistan Airline 
Pilots Association (PALPA) has drawn a comprehensive fuel conservation plan which could save up to Rs 62 billion 
per month.
 According to Captain Sohail Baloch, President, PALPA PIA was losing Rs 60 million daily due to 'flawed 
procedures or bad administration.' In his estimation, with the present fleet, a saving of at least Rs one billion a year 
could be achieved provided measures suggested by PALPA are adopted. PALPA and Pakistan International 
Airlines officials are now engaged in discussions how to go about to take advantage of the plan and reduce airline's 
appallingly high losses.
 PALPA has pointed out that the successful low cost airlines are more profitable than established carriers. Ryanair 
of Ireland, for instance has a market capitalisation of about three billion pound sterling. Globally, the largest and 
most successful low cost airline is Southwest in the US. According to PALPA calculations monthly fuel burn by PIA 
comes to US gallons 207,834,710 costing Rs 62 billion.
 On 60 percent operational fleet (21 aircraft) estimated savings could be Rs 3.1 billion and on 100 percent 
operational fleet (38 aircraft) savings could be Rs 5.6 billion. Cost Per Minutes (CPM), per aircraft has been 
calculated as under: B 747-300 Rs 29,568. B 777-300 ER Rs 31,976. B 777-200 ER Rs 23,705. B 777-200 LR Rs 
27,237. A-310 GE Rs 15,300. A-310 PW Rs 14,704, and B-737 Rs 8,033.
 Required strategy: Strategic Cost Management (SCM) is the magic word for immediate sustenance. SCM focuses 
on cost reduction and continuous improvement which could easily be achieved through smart planning. Fuel 
consumption, PALPA says is a major cost to an airline, and PIA needs to focus their attention, in order to maintain 
their profitability. PALPA's plan looks at all significant operating variables that affect fuel economy for the current 
PIA fleet. It shows that there are many factors that affect fuel consumption and that the potential gains and losses 
are huge. Most of these factors are directly controlled by PIA's main employees, i.e. flight dispatcher, ground 
engineer and finally pilots.
 PALPA encourages a smart and sincere approach to fuel efficiency management through which, it believes, 
maximum benefit could be delivered to the airline. It emphasises that fuel management is foremost after flight 
safety. A fuel efficiency program does not - and should never - aim at compromising safety. Techniques applied to 
save fuel, for a particular type of aircraft may not necessarily be the same for another type of aircraft. For this 
different techniques need to be applied for different aircrafts.
 PALPA works out fuel conservation plan
 For fuel and cost efficient operation following are the main features: Utilization of the Sabre Flight Plan Manager to 
its maximum, efficient and effective flight planning based on correct/true data, correct aircraft loading (fuel weight 
and CG), an aerodynamically clean aircraft, optimal use of systems (APU, Bleed, Flaps/Slats, Gear, etc), flight 
procedures using speeds and altitudes appropriate to the airline economic priorities, use of FMS in the managed 
mode, and optimal usage of the flight watch it available.
 Sabre system is capable of generating nine different types of flight plans. In PIA, the flight plans are made on 
minimum time basis only, whereas, the options available to the dispatcher are minimum cost, minimum time, 
minimum route cost, minimum fuel etc. PIA need to develop a checklist to utilise the available system in the most 
effective manner.

 It was anything but a Manic Monday[1] on Wall Street, with markets moving nowhere fast in desultory trading 
action, but for David Karp, born the year The Bangles released their best-selling song, Merger Monday was music 
to his ears. Tumblr's 20-something boy wonder is laughing all the way to the bank[2] after being bought by Yahoo 
(YHOO) for $1.1 billion. "F*%k yeah![3]" was his considered reaction to the deal, the air being turned as blue as 
Marissa Mayer's hair[4]. Ryanair's (OTCMKTS:RYAAY[5]) CEO turned the air blue long ago[6] and his stock just 
surged 5.33% to the highest level in its history, so maybe there is something to be said for swearing like a drunken 
sailor. Elsewhere Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) jumped 1.18% to a similar all-time best. Yesterday's New Yorker 
cartoon[7] was clearly on to something.
 No top-tier economic data due today, but expect earnings announcements out of Analog Devices (ADI), AutoZone 
(AZO), Best Buy (BBY), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Home Depot (HD), Medtronic (MDT), NetApp (NTAP), Saks

LinkedIn (LNKD): The stock gets launched with a Buy at BGC Partners.
PAREXEL (PRXL): ISI Group gives the stock a Neutral rating.
Sony (NYSE:SNE[8]): Jefferies resumes Buy-rated coverage on the Japanese consumer electronics giant, whose 
shares have gained 48.41% over the past year.
Summer Infant (SUMR): The stock is picked up with an Overweight at Piper Jaffray.
Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC): Shares are initiated with an Outperform and $31 price objective at FBR Capital, 
which notes its Canadian brand Monarch offers investors impressive diversification.
Toy Stocks: Piper Jaffray assigns Overweights on Hasbro (HAS), LeapFrog (LF), and Mattel (MAT). It has a new 
Neutral on JAKKS Pacific (JAKK).
World Energy (XWES): Citing the company's energy efficiency platforms, Northland Capital rolls out Outperform-

 No thrills airline Ryanair has reported record full-year profits and rising revenues, despite soaring fuel costs.
The discount airline announced profits after tax rose 13% to 569m euros (£481m) on revenues of 4.88bn euros for 
the year to 31 March. Passenger traffic grew 5% to 79.3 million as the airline added 217 new routes to its roster, 
bringing the total to 1,600.
The only drawback was fuel costs, which rose by more than €290m and now account for 45% of total costs.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "With almost zero yield visibility into the second half and the EU-wide 
recession, we expect that there will continue to be downward pressure on yields which will dampen full year profit 
growth."
The budget carrier, which recently had its third attempt to buy rival Aer Lingus blocked by the European 
Commission, expects "modest" traffic growth for 2014.
Passenger traffic is expected to increase just 2% this summer but should increase to around 5% in the second half 
as it grounds fewer winter aircraft compared to the prior years. Traffic in the full year 2014 is set to grow by 3% to 
81.5m, Ryanair said.
In March, Dublin-based Ryanair unveiled plans to buy 175 Boeing 737-800 jets valued at $15.6 billion before 
discounts, and hopes this year to reach a deal for more than 100 of Boeing's new 737 Max jets if it can secure the 
right terms.
The orders underscore the carrier's ambition to grow from 80 million passengers a year to more than 100 million as 
it capitalises on the reductions in short-haul routes at many legacy carriers.
Low cost carriers are outperforming the rest of the airlines market as passengers feel the pinch in the economic 
downturn. Rival easyJet has gone from strength to strength since joining the FTSE 100 in March, with its shares 
also now at all-time highs.

 Stock futures are down slightly following Friday's gains as investors have no economic data to digest this morning.
Dow (INDEXDJX:.DJI[1]) futures were down 0.08% at 15,303. SP 500 (INDEXSP:.INX[2]) futures slipped 0.09% to 
1,661.50. Nasdaq (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC[3]) futures fell 0.16% to 3,018. The US economic calendar is quiet until 
Wednesday, when we get existing home sales data and the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve Open Market 
Committee.
 Overseas markets also reached records. Germany's DAX (INDEXDB:DAX) led Europe, rising 0.35% to a record 
high. Japan's Nikkei (INDEXNIKKEI:.NI225) gained 1.5% on economic optimism and a weakening yen. The stock 
index is up 48% year-to-date, with exporters that benefit from a cheap currency leading the way. The government 
raised its expectations for economic growth this year. 
 Chinese home prices increased at a slower pace in April. Of the 70 cities surveyed, 67 reported price increases 
from March.
 Over the weekend, Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO[4]) closed the acquisition of Tumblr[5], a six-year-old blogging 
network, for $1.1 billion. The deal was 100% cash. Shares of the Internet media company rose 0.53% in the pre-
market. Since the start of the year, the company has advanced over 33%. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM[6]) analyst 
Doug Anmuth wrote[7] that the deal was a positive step for Yahoo.
Campbell's Soup Co. (NYSE:CPB[8]) reported profits of $181 million, or $0.57 per share in its third fiscal quarter, up 
from $0.55 a year earlier as the company works to expand its offerings to serve customers' changing tastes as well 
as expand overseas.
Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY[9]), Europe's biggest discount airline, saw profit increase 13% over the first 
three months of the year.
Pandora (NYSE:P[10]) shares rose 2.68% to $16.49 after Barclay's recommended it as equal weight, up from 
underweight. The analysts noted that Pandora is successfully improving its monetization of mobile users.
 In a commencement speech at Simon Rock, a small college in Massachusetts, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made 
the case for optimism thanks to technology and worker productivity.
 "Invention was once the province of the isolated scientist or tinkerer. The transmission of new ideas and the 
adaptation of the best new insights to commercial uses were slow and erratic. But all of that is changing radically. 
We live on a planet that is becoming richer and more populous, and in which not only the most advanced 
economies but also large emerging market nations like China and India increasingly see their economic futures as 
tied to technological innovation," the Chairman said.

 [I wrote this piece, unsolicited, for Comment is Free of The Guardian today. They did not want it, so I publish it here 
instead]
 Last week on these pages the CBI's John Cridland set out why leaving the EU would be bad for British business[1]. 
Business grandees such as Richard Branson and Martin Sorrell follow that up with a letter in today's 
Independent[2].
 Fair enough you might say. The EU is vital to jobs and growth, so it is good that business leaders are making the 
case.
 This is all very well, but it is not enough. The pro-EU case in the UK tends to feel like some kind of immense bean-
counting exercise, where all of the pros of trade and the cons of regulation are weighed up, and the outcome is 
supposed to be positive. Listen to any mainstream pro-EU politician, from Douglas Alexander to Nick Clegg to 
David Cameron, and the refrain is always the same - that to be in the EU is vital for British business. And that's 
about it.
 But what about those of us who do not own or run businesses? What about the rights of workers, or the concerns 
of people who want to protect our wildlife or our environment? Put it another way, where in the everyday political 
debate about the EU in the UK are the TUC, the Royal College of Nursing, or the RSPB or Greenpeace?
 Frances O'Grady has spoken out about how Tory calls for repatriation are an assault on workers' rights[3] but the 
mainstream political left in the UK is too scared to take up the argument. Even the implementation of the Working 
Time Directive with its loopholes for the UK has helped nurses and junior doctors in the UK. Meanwhile EU 
membership has forced Britain to clean up its environment[4] while UKIP calls for the repeal of the Bathing Water 
Directive that protects swimmers around British coasts[5]. Bees will be better off as the EU temporarily bans 
neonicotinoids[6], while the horsemeat scandal showed the importance of the traceability of foodstuffs. EU law 
helps those travelling get emergency medical care, helps keep roaming charges down on their mobile phones, and 
Ryanair and Easyjet would not even exist were it not for the EU liberalising the airline market.
 I hope by now that the picture is starting to become clear. All of these examples are not just purely pros for British 
business, and they call into question the notion - still maintained in the UK - that the EU could somehow just be 
something about markets and trade.
 The case for the EU in the UK needs to be made in many ways. It must not be just a case for British business in 
the EU, but a workers' case for the EU, an environmental case for the EU, a liberal case for the EU or a social 
What I would have written for CiF… Being pro-EU in the UK must not just be a proxy for British business in the 
EU
democratic case for the EU. It is about each and every one of us as people, with our own needs and our own 
values, and not all just supporting the EU because it is purported to be positive for our British business overlords.
 This means too that the way we talk about the European Union needs to change. It is not, as David Cameron 
seems to imply, something that is done to the UK. The UK is part of the European Union and can seek to change its 
direction from within. To criticise the liberalisation of airline markets or, conversely, the Working Time Directive, 
must become part of political debate, but it must be possible to critique the policy without attacking the EU per se.

 One day, the music will finally stop on Wall Street, but it was never going to happen in a week when Gordon Gekko 
officially turned into Liberace[1]. The pianist, famous for saying "Too much of a good thing is wonderful," would 
certainly relate to the current over-the-top ebullience in equities. Dow Industrials (^DJI), now up four straight weeks, 
rose a further 1.56% to finish at fresh peaks. When Omaha's Oracle is downgraded[2] even as Athens, of all places, 
is upgraded[3], that may eventually come to be seen as the moment Mr. Market lost his mind. For now, however, 
let's just sit back and marvel at an 83% five-session surge in National Bank of Greece (NBG) and a concurrent 13% 
jump in France's Compagnie Financière Richemont (OTCMKTS: CFRUY), which makes pricey Cartier watches it's 
a wonder any of the country's citizens can afford. With Europe now in its deepest economic debacle since the 
Second World War[4], the continent sensibly voted a song called Only Teardrops as its top of the pops[5] on 
Saturday. That would surely be a more appropriate anthem than its current official ditty, Beethoven's Ode to Joy[6].
 No top-tier economic data due today, but earnings announcements are expected out of Campbell Soup (CPB), 
Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), Ryanair (OTCMKTS: RYAAY), TiVo Inc. (TIVO), and Urban Outfitters (URBN).
Franklin Street Properties (FSP): FSP is a new Neutral at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Homebuilders: M/I Homes (MHO) and Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) are each picked up with an Overweight at 
JPMorgan.
Joe's Jeans (JOEZ): The stock is a new Neutral at B. Riley Co., whose target price is $2.15.
Michael Kors (KORS): Canaccord Genuity covers the fashion firm at a Buy.
MusclePharm Corporation (OTCMKTS:MSLP[7]): The maker of Amino 1, a hydration sports recovery drink, is 
begun with a Strong Buy and $16 price objective at Ascendiant Capital Markets. Product sales are approaching 
$100 million annually, and operating margins are poised to improve.
STMicroelectronics (STM): The semiconductor stock is trading 2.43% higher in London this morning after being 
assigned an Overweight at JPMorgan.
Student Transportation (STB): BMO Capital begins Market Perform-rated research on STB.

 With equities going to Pluto, how appropriate that Star Trek topped the box office[1]. Especially as Priceline.com 
(PCLN) - upgraded this morning after surging some 6.3% last week - has had as its spokesman Captain Kirk. 
William Shatner, of course, used to split infinitives ("to boldly go…[2]") as effortlessly as his company was once - 
hard as it may be to believe now - compelled to reverse split its stock[3] to stay alive. 
The SP 500 Index (^GSPC) advanced another 2.07% to a new record, with Google (GOOG) jumping $28.95 to 
finish above $900 for the first time. No wonder a couple of middle-age folks are willing to Intern there for free[4]. 
Generation X will likely never be able to retire[5] but ex-Google employee Marissa Mayer is making many rich 
further down the age scale. Fresh from handing a teenager $30 million[6], Yahoo (YHOO) just paid $1.1 billion for a 
firm owned by a 26-year-old[7]. Bullion fell 5% and is now down for seven straight sessions, its worst run since 
March 2009. To paraphrase what Simon and Garfunkel once said of Joe DiMaggio, "Where have you gone, 
Goldenballs[8]? A long-suffering commodity complex turns its lonely eyes to you."
 No top-tier economic data due today, but earnings announcements are expected out of Campbell Soup (CPB), 
Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), Ryanair (OTCMKTS:RYAAY[9]), TiVo Inc. (TIVO), and Urban Outfitters (URBN).
Abbott Labs (ABT): Goldman Sachs gives the medical device maker a Buy-from-Neutral lift.
Accenture (ACN): The consulting giant is now Buy from Neutral at Goldman.
IBERIABANK (IBKC): Stephens increases IBKC to Overweight from Equal Weight.
JC Penney (JCP): A temporary reprieve for the recently-troubled retailer, today taken to Buy from Hold at Maxim. Its 
target price, previously $16.50, is taken to $27 to reflect a recent change in strategy aimed at improving store traffic.
Netease.com (NTES): NTES is now Buy from Neutral at Citigroup.
Northrop Grumman (NOC): CRT Capital raises the defense company to Fair Value from Sell after its $4 billion 
share repurchase plan.
Pandora Media (P): The Internet radio outfit gets boosted to Equal Weight from Underweight by Barclays. It "…has 
made significant progress in improving its ability to monetize its growing mobile usage," analysts wrote in a note. 
Shares are higher as a result this morning.
Priceline.com (NASDAQ:PCLN[10]): The online travel firm, already up 28.74% in the past 12 months having 
finished at a fresh 52-week peak on Friday, is this morning hoisted to Buy from Hold at Deutsche Bank. The broker 
calls it the "clear global secular winner" in its industry.
Stock Upgrades: Priceline Is Going Places
T-Mobile US (TMUS): Deutsche Bank takes the telecom stock to Buy from Hold amid an improvement in its 
operating momentum.
WNS Holdings (WNS): Shares are upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Goldman.

 Five short months into 2013, the planet's best performing stock market of 2012[1] literally can't afford to wipe its 
backside[2]. So investors may eventually give our own bull run the bum's rush. For now, however, let's just marvel 
at how far - 146%, to be precise - we have come from the Haines bottom[3]. (Not to be confused with Hanesbrands 
(HBI), an underwear stock that is now up 102.82% in the past year, having finished at a fresh historic high on 
Friday.) A new iPad commode[4] will be scant consolation for both Caracas and Cupertino, especially after Apple 
Inc. (AAPL) imploded 4.4% in a week when the Nasdaq (^IXIC) added on another 1.82% to finish at its best level 
since 2000. 13 years ago Sisqó - whose briefs would make anyone blush[5] - topped the pop charts and Cisco 
(CSCO) briefly boasted the world's best market cap. 13 years on, the former remains firmly a one-hit wonder but 
the latter, fresh from jumping a Dow (^DJI) best 14.9%, may have more staying power.
 No top-tier economic data due today, but earnings announcements are expected out of Campbell Soup (CPB), 
Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), Ryanair (OTCMKTS:RYAAY[6]), TiVo Inc. (TIVO), and Urban Outfitters (URBN).
Acquity Group (AQ): Shares gets downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform by William Blair.
Bank of America (BAC): The blue chip, a key Dow (^DJI) component, is cut to Market Perform from Outperform at 
Keefe Bruyette, which would take profits after a recent breakout to new highs.
Bank of Ireland (IRE): Deutsche Bank downgrades its fellow financial to Sell from Hold.
Bed Bath Beyond (BBBY): Shares are taken to Hold from Buy at Jefferies.
Capella Education (CPLA): Stifel reduces its recommendation to Hold from Buy.
CarMax (KMX): The auto outfit gets cut to Market Perform from Outperform by William Blair.
Cavium Networks (CAVM): CAVM is now Market Perform from Outperform at JMP Securities.
Children's Place (PLCE): Susquehanna reduces the retailer to Neutral from Positive.
Financials: Keefe moves money manager BlackRock (BLK) to Market Perform from Outperform and downgrades 
discount brokers Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) to Underperform from Market Perform.
Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN[7]): The donut stock is lowered to Neutral from Buy at Longbow. Shares, which 
have surged 33.84% over the past year and hit a fresh peak last week, are due a breather. The stock is, 
accordingly, off 1.3% this morning.
Equifax (EFX): Shares get downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs.
Fast Food: Chili's owner Brinker International (EAT) and Ruby Tuesday (RT) are each reduced to Market Perform 
from Outperform with Wells Fargo.
Kansas City Southern (KSU): The railroad is slashed to Sell from Hold at Stifel.
Leap Wireless (LEAP): LEAP gets lowered to Sell from Hold by Deutsche Bank.
Stock Downgrades: Dunkin' Bull Run Done?
Lowe's (LOW): A steep valuation, allied to store execution issues, sees Oppenheimer reduce the home 
improvement retailer to Perform from Outperform.
MicroStrategy (MSTR): JMP Securities moves the tech stock to Market Perform from Outperform.
NetApp (NTAP): NTAP is now Underperform from Neutral at Robert W. Baird, which cites both competitive and 
structural issues.
Red Hat (RHT): RHT gets reduced to Market Perform from Outperform with a $54 price objective at BMO Capital 
Markets. Sharp recent stock price gains, especially amid softness in many key metrics, are unsustainable the 
broker believes.
SanDisk (SNDK): The stock is clipped to Neutral from Buy at Nomura.
Synovus (SNV): Goldman Sachs slashes its fellow financial firm to Sell from Neutral.
Thoratec (THOR): THOR gets taken to Neutral from Buy at Goldman.

 Well, that's one clever way to get a job.
 Unemployed journalist Enzo Vizcaino[1] took up a different type of performance art on the Barcelona Metro in 
Spain recently by singing his resume[2].
 With a bachelor's degree in journalism and a postgraduate diploma, Vizcaino's credentionals are nothing to snort 
at. But like many recent graduates in Spain, where the unemployment rate is 27.2 percent[3], Vizcaino was unable 
to find a job. 
 So Vizcaino came up with a better idea than printing out countless copies of his curriculum vitae -- many of which 
would probably just end up in the recycle bin[4], he reasons on his blog.
 While a friend filmed, Vizcaino strummed on a ukulele and serenaded straphangers on the Barcelona Metro.
 "Degree in journalism and a master's diploma that is folded right here, in case you'd like to see it," he croons. "I'm 
the King of Word, Excel and Powerpoint. I control Photoshop." (See full lyrics below)
 Fortunately, after the video was posted on YouTube and shared widely on social media, the job offers flooded in[5], 
Vizcaino notes on his blog.
 We've come across some creative CVs before -- like this chocolate bar resume[6] and Philippe Dubost's faux 
Amazon page[7] -- but nothing quite this expressive.
 Watch Vizcaino sing his resume (in Spanish) on the subway in the video above, or see the full lyrics (in English) 
below.
 LYRICS: (Translation by The Huffington Post)
 Degree in journalism
and a master's diploma
that is folded right here,
in case you'd like to see it. 
 Complementary training:
An online course I found on Groupalia
about community management.
I'm on expert on Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest,
Linkedin and MySpace.
 Professional experience,
at a local radio station,
Singing Resume: Unemployed Journalist Enzo Vizcaino Belts Out CV On Barcelona Metro (VIDEO)
with a fellowship contract,
that was unpaid, of course.
 And even if it wasn't my thing,
I also worked as a salesperson,
I worked in a call center,
and as a cashier in Mediamark.
 With regards to languages I'll say:
My English level is good,
I used to fly with Ryanair.
Parlo anche Italiano, (I also speak Italian)
Livello amore de verano, (Summer fling level)
and I understand some French.
 I'm the King of Word,
Excel and Powerpoint.
I control Photoshop.
 Don't reach for your wallet,
I'm not here to ask for money.
Though maybe you have a friend or relative...
Need a journalist, screenwriter,
writer or editor,
music composer...
 Or maybe you're looking for a more basic service.
I also know how to kneel
and for a special price
I will let you whip me.

The 20 Worst Airlines In The World
The 20 Worst Airlines In The World
The Business Insider

May 17, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Air travel can be a miserable experience these days — especially when you are flying economy class.
 Since nothing is worse than being stuck in a small uncomfortable seat with limited leg room, terrible food, and rude 
service, we think the in-flight experience is the most important factor in enjoying your flight.
 We ranked the 20 worst airlines for flying economy in the world, based on the most unpleasant in-flight 
experiences.
 To compile this list, we looked at dozens of major international airlines that fly long-haul routes and have economy 
class seats. We looked at ratings (scored on a scale of one to five) from leading airline reviewer Skytrax[1] for seat 
comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and condition, quality of meals served, and service efficiency.
 We included passenger reviews for each airline (scored out of ten) also from Skytrax.
 We adjusted each measure to be out of 100, and averaged them to produce a final score that reflects the overall 
in-flight experience. Ratings are out of 100 points. 20. Sky Express
 Rated 50 out of 100 for economy class. 
 Air Algerie flies a fleet of 45 Airbus and Boeing planes, with orders placed for 16 more. 
 In 2012, it started leasing Boeing 747 jumbo jets to cope with extra demand[2] during the Hajj and Umrah Muslim 
pilgrimages. 
Its passenger review score of 60 was quite good, but poor Skytrax ratings for in-flight entertainment, cabin 
cleanliness, and staff response to passenger requests make it the 20th worst airline in the world for flying economy.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[3].
18. Ryanair (tie)
 Rated 49.2 out of 100 for economy class.
 This "ultra-low-cost" airline is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, and has a fleet of over 300 aircraft.
 Although the no-frills carrier[4] has non-reclining seats and lacks seat-back pockets, it carries a surprising number 
of business travelers, and it may have figured out how to save Greece's tourism industry[5].
The 20 Worst Airlines In The World
 Now, Ryanair has plans to reduce the number of toilets[6] on each plane from three to one, with the benefit of 
fitting six more paying passengers on each flight.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[7].
18. Merpati Nusantara Airlines (tie)
 Rated 49.2 out of 100 for economy class.
 Merpati Nusantara Airlines is an Indonesian airline based out of Jakarta.
 It operates domestic and international flights, but it — along with 286 other airlines — is deemed "unsafe" by the 
EU, and is banned from flying in European airspace[8].
 Skytrax gave the carrier just one star out of five for in-flight entertainment and interaction with passengers. The 
food's not terrible, though — it got three and a half stars.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[9].
17. Biman Bangladesh Airlines
 Rated 49 out of 100 for economy class.
 The national airline of Bangladesh[10] announced in April it has hired its first foreign CEO[11], Kevin Steele, 
formerly of British Airways.
 Biman Bangladesh is currently permitted to fly into the EU, and operates flights to 20 different destinations.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[12].
16. Cubana Airlines
 Rated 47.7 out of 100 for economy class.
 Cubana is banned from flying to the US by the American commercial embargo against Cuba, but its international 
destinations include Europe, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
 The Cuban government owns the airline, and has since 1959. It recently upgraded a number of planes in its fleet 
with Russian-made aircrafts.
 Nonetheless, it received two-star ratings from Skytrax for cabin cleanliness, staff presence, and staff responses to 
requests.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[13].
15. Nepal Airlines
 Rated 46.7 out of 100 for economy class.
 The former chairman of Nepal Airlines was convicted of corruption charges in 2011.[14]
 The airline also once sacrificed goats to appease a Hindu god[15] after a technical problem. 
 Weak points include meals and staff responses to passenger requests.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[16].
14. Royal Air Maroc
 Rated 46.5 out of 100 for economy class.
The 20 Worst Airlines In The World
 Royal Air Maroc is the largest airline in Morocco and operates an all-Boeing fleet.
 It has an open sky agreement[17] with the EU, which brings in the majority of its international visitors and is a main 
driving force for Morocco's tourism industry.
 The airline received just one star for staff presence during flight.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[18].
12. TAAG Angola Airlines (tie)
 Rated 45.8 out of 100 for economy class.
 TAAG Angola Airlines had previously been completely blocked from EU airspace, but the ban has been partially 
lifted[19].
 During its ban, it wet-leased aircraft[20] (when the aircraft comes with crew and insurance) from South African 
Airlines to continue its long-haul flights.
 TAAG recently announced it would increase the number of flights to Cuba and Zimbabwe.
 Skytrax users gave the airline just 3.5 points out of 10.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[21].
12. Pegasus Airlines (tie)
 Rated 45.8 out of 100 for economy class.
 Pegasus Airlines is a low-cost airline and is the second largest airline in Turkey.
 None of its ratings are above three stars, but that could change: The carrier is launching new routes[22] to Doha 
and Athens, and just had a successful IPO in Turkey[23].
It operates Boeing aircraft, and has orders placed for dozens of Airbuses.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[24].
11. Spirit
 Rated 45 out of 100 for economy class.
 Spirit is one of only two two-star airlines operating in the Americas, the other being Cubana Airlines.
 The airline is known for its outrageous fees[25] and its strict no-refund policy, which could backfire[26] eventually. 
 Spirit also got itself on Consumer Reports's 2012 "naughty" list[27], and annoyed liberals on election day with a 
"Romney Wins!" email[28].
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[29].
10. Syrian Air
 Rated 44.8 out of 100 for economy class.
 Syrian Air is operating far fewer flights than it has in the past, due to EU sanctions[30] put into place since the start 
of its civil war.
 In 2012, one of its planes collided in midair[31] with a military helicopter, over Damascus. The plane, carrying 200 
people, landed safely, but the helicopter was destroyed. It's unclear is anyone onboard was injured or killed, 
according to the New York Times[32].
The 20 Worst Airlines In The World
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[33].
9. Tajik Air
 Rated 43.3 out of 100 for economy class.
 Established in 1923, Tajik Air is the national airline of Tajikistan. 
 Its last fatal crash occurred in 1997,[34] killing all 79 passengers and six of the seven crew members. Two crashes 
in 1993 killed more than 120 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network[35].
 Skytrax gives Tajik Air two star rankings for comfort and staff interaction with passengers.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[36].
8. Iceland Express
 Rated 42.8 out of 100 for economy class.
 Iceland Express is a low-cost carrier that currently does not offer any flights to or from the U.S.[37]
 Its tiny fleet is composed of just two Airbus A320s, and the airline was acquired by carrier WOW Air[38] in October 
2012.
 The airline got two stars from Skytrax for meal service, staff cabin presence, and assistance during boarding.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[39].
7. Rossiya Airlines
 Rated 42.7 out of 100 for economy class.
 St. Petersburg-based Rossiya Airlines just completed a fleet renewal program,[40] but that may not be enough to 
bump it off of this list. 
 Most of its planes are made by Airbus, but it does have Boeings and Russian-made aircraft as well.
 In 2010, it merged with Aeroflot, which then reported a 66% drop in profitability in 2012.[41]
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[42].
6. Bulgaria Air
 Rated 41.8 out of 100 for economy class.
 Founded in 2002, Bulgaria Air is based out of Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, and has a fleet of 18 planes.
 It recently added low-cost flights[43] to Amsterdam that will make it easier to connect to the U.S., Canada, and the 
rest of Europe.
 It got two stars from Skytrax for amenities (like blankets and pillows), service efficiency, and staff language skills.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[44].
5. Air Koryo
 Rated 39.2 out of 100 for economy class.
 Flights on North Korea's state-owned airline — the world's only one-star carrier[45] — include "revolutionary 
marching music," food that's described as "edible," and a concerning amount of water vapor in the cabin, according 
to past customers[46].
 Of Air Koryo's entire fleet, only two of its new planes are permitted in European Union airspace.
The 20 Worst Airlines In The World
 The airline is currently trying to upgrade its aging aircraft, and will likely purchase new planes from Russia because 
of sanctions by the U.S. and EU.
 Here is what it is like to fly on Air Koryo.[47]
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[48].
4. Uzbekistan Airways
 Rated 37.5 out of 100 for economy class.
 Since its first flight in 1992, Uzbekistan Airways has had three fatal accidents,[49] killing a total of 54 people.
 It received one-star ratings for in-flight entertainment, amenities, and staff response to passenger requests, so it's 
no surprise it's the fourth worst airline on this list.
Most of its international flights depart from Tashkent, Uzbekistan's capital, but the airline operates international 
flights from other regional airports as well.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[50].
3. Ukraine International Airlines
 Rated 36.3 out of 100 for economy class.
 The airline that once flew Pope John Paul II around Ukraine[51] has a relatively high passenger reviews score of 
58, but it did poorly in the other categories, bringing its overall ranking to the third worst airline.
 It is based in Kiev and operates flights to over 60 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[52].
2. Sudan Airways
 Rated 33.3 out of 100 for economy class.
 Sudan Airways is the second-worst airline in the world for economy travelers.
 While it did receive two stars for seat comfort, it did not score above two stars in any other category we considered.
 The airline is currently banned by the European Union and serves only destinations within Sudan, Africa, and the 
Middle East.
 In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[53].
1. Turkmenistan Airlines
 Rated 30.8 out of 100 for economy class.
 Turkmenistan Airlines is the worst airline to fly economy.
 The carrier is based out of Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, and it has a fleet of Boeing airplanes for its 
passenger flights.
 Turkmenistan is the first former Soviet state to use Boeing aircraft, and all of the airline's international flights are 
flown by Western-trained pilots[54].
 Nonetheless, terrible rankings on Skytrax for in-flight entertainment, seat comfort, service efficiency, staff response 
to passenger requests, and staff language skills make it the worst airline you can find.
In-flight experience score is an average of ratings for seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cabin cleanliness and 
condition, quality of meals served, service efficiency, and passenger reviews, provided by Skytrax[55].

Unbundling services: The latest move to earn more revenue

May 11, 2013 (Hindustan Times Blogs:http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 New Delhi, May 11 -- In 2009, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced that it would charge its passengers one 
Pound Sterling to use the toilet during the journey! Following massive public outcry, it did abandon the idea, but 
that's the extent to which unbundling of air services can go. 
So, don't believe the union ministry of civil aviation when it says that its latest move to allow airlines to unbundle 
services and charge for them separately is in the interest of consumers or that it's going to bring down fares! What 
it's going to do is to allow airlines to come up with more and more novel ways of extracting money from passengers. 
Even before the ministry allowed unbundling of services, some of the airlines have been charging 'extra' for various 
'services' - Rs. 50 for giving a printout of the ticket , Rs. 100 for selecting your seat at the time of booking, Rs. 400 
for the front row, to quote a few examples. Now with the government allowing them to charge separately for check-
in baggage and preferential seating, consumers will end up paying more and more for their air travel. Already, some 
airlines have announced extra charges for preferential seats (window and aisle) and reduced the free baggage 
allowance to 15 kgs. They have also increased the charges for additional weight. Time will not be far off when there 
will be no free baggage allowance at all and consumers will have to pay for their check-in baggage. And after 
paying through your nose for the baggage, if it gets lost, the compensation that you get will not be adequate even to 
buy the suitcase, let alone its contents. Because while blithely allowing the airlines to rake in ancillary revenue, the 
ministry conveniently forgets the abysmally low liability that the airlines incur for loss of check-in baggage under the 
Carriage by Air Act. In 2009, it revised the compensation provided under the law for international travel but did not 
do so for domestic travel which continues to remain at Rs. 450 a kilogram (loss measured by weight!) In recent 
times, passengers have been complaining about valuables removed from check-in baggage. In fact, pilferage of 
baggage and loss of baggage constitutes the third largest number of complaints (15.26 per cent) received against 
the aviation sector by the National Consumer Helpline, run by the union ministry of consumer affairs (and managed 
by the Delhi University). Similarly, last month, the Delhi Police busted a gang of thieves operating at the inline 
baggage system department at the Indira Gandhi International airport and recovered a number of electronic items 
stolen from passengers' bags. The thieves apparently identified, during scanning, bags with valuables and stole 
them. It speaks volumes about the security measures in place at the airport and the due diligence carried out before 
employing people for such sensitive jobs. So let's assume that you are travelling by air to attend a family wedding 
and even pay an additional Rs. 1,500 for baggage (for carrying more than 15 kgs). When you reach your 
destination, you find your most expensive saree, costing Rs. 20,000 missing. You lodge a complaint and the airline 
offers you a grand compensation of Rs. 900, calculated at the rate of Rs. 450 a kilogram. That's how well your 
interests are protected by the civil aviation ministry. The airline cannot escape liability for what it has sold. If it

 Betting Angle
 I was going to start with the exciting news that Ryanair is set to become the new sponsor of the Barcelona[1] 
Grand Prix. In the belief the Circuit de Catalunya is, like numerous Ryanair airports, upwards of 50 miles away from 
the city it is supposed to be in, it seemed the perfect sponsorship fit.
 Naturally I was being facetious as there is little to get excited about at this circuit which has regularly been accused 
of delivering a boring spectacle. That's a little harsh. With the pole-sitter winning this race every year for a decade, 
a sequence broken only by Mark Webber[2] in 2011 and resumed by Pastor Maldonado[3] last year, tedious is a 
better description.
 On the bright side I've just learned Rodolfo Gonzalez will be at the wheel of a Marussia[4] for the first free practice 
session. That offers some relief as I'm looking forward to hearing quips about 'Speedy Gonzalez'.
 Talking of TV icons, it was also great to see the world's richest man, Carlos Slim, in Bahrain[5]. I confess every 
time I heard his name I thought of cigars - of the slim panatella variety - and the classic 80's television commercial 
featuring 'Carlos Fandango wide wheels'. For those intrigued and under the age of 45 I refer you to YouTube[6].
 OK, with the notable exceptions of McLaren[7] and Williams[8], last year's form has been an exceptional insight 
into this year's results. Yes, the Ferrari[9] looks more competitive than at this stage last season and Lotus[10] 
slightly better but, all in all, cars are performing pretty much as they did at individual circuits twelve months 
previously.
 Therein, when looking for form clues, I'm going to delve no deeper than the outset of the 2012 season. Nothing 
else should bear any relevance.
Strikingly the Red Bulls qualified seventh and eleventh in China last year and that form translated into a ninth and 
fourteenth qualifying in this year's rendition of the very same race.
 Alarmingly for Red Bull[11] fans they only qualified seventh and eleventh here in Barcelona[12] last season and I'm 
confident that will equate to another disappointing showing this weekend. I appear to be alone on this stance as 
Vettel[13] is just 6/4 at Betvictor.com[14] (and that's the biggest price of all the bookmaking firms) to claim pole this 
weekend.
 Most are aware you need to start at the front of the grid to have any chance in Barcelona[15] - it is the ideal prep 
for Monaco[16] - and therein I am leaning towards a bold showing, potentially a race win… from Mercedes[17].
 Before you offer me a straight choice between a breathalyser and our old friend the canvas cardigan with those 
arms that tie behind the back please stop to consider…
F1: Roy the Boy's betting guide to Spain
 Many were stunned when Nico Rosberg[18]'s Mercedes[19] claimed pole in Bahrain[20] - he was backed at 200/1 
to do so - but should it have been such a surprise? He had done the same twelve months previously and his 
teammate, Hamilton[21], took pole in China, the third race of the current season, a week beforehand.

Apr 23, 2013 (Chillin' Competition:http://chillingcompetition.com Delivered by Newstex)
 A few days ago Nico wrote a post about 'Commission bashing[1]' in which he acknowledged that, in reality, he's not 
a Commission basher but rather appreciates the good things that Comp does [the fact that one of the three 
examples given -next to the Guidance Paper and the effects-based approach..- was Post Danmark -a Court 
Judgment- reveals that Nico struggled to find good deeds on the Commission's part :)]
 Until now, the most vocal Commission basher I knew of was Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO (check out his CV 
and the accompanying Commission disclaimer here[2].) We've previously referred to his comparison of Comp 
officials with Kim Il-Jung (sic) and with North Korean economists[3], but you may not have watched his 
equally… outspoken intervention at the EU Innovation Convention in 2011 (worth checking it out here[4])
 But Mr. O'Leary now faces fierce competition. A friend at the Commission (in spite of him begging me to make his 
name public, I won't) just sent me a link to a blog which appears to overpass Ryanair's chief's tone. The blog 
is called Venitism, and it has just published a post mildly titled: The stupid European Commission harassess the 
chip industry[5]. Actually, the title is much softer than its content and than its pics. It's so overdone that it's worth 
taking a cursory look if you've a minute.
 Aside from insulting the Commission, the post states that its authors have conducted a survey that reveals that 
80% of economists would favor the abolition of antitrust rules. I'm told by my economist friends that this cannot be 
true, for, they say 'the literature makes it clear that antitrust law promotes our welfare'

 For the intrepid budget traveler, few frontiers offer as many challenges--and potential victories--as Europe. It may 
seem like sky-high prices, particularly in summer, are a nonnegotiable in Europe, but travelers willing to expand 
their frontiers will encounter dazzling affordability along with dozens of new reasons to love the continent. 
 To find cities offering exceptional value right now, we looked at five value indexes that measure everything from 
flight prices to average hotel costs to the amount you can expect to pay for a pint of beer in a particular city. Often, 
the cities featured on lists like these come with more expensive flights, so we also factored in average airfares by 
season. For the places where flights are pricier, we offer some suggestions for keeping airfare costs down. 
 What we found is that while there are deals to be found in Western Europe, for a truly affordable European 
experience, your best bet is to look east. 
 Bon voyage! Or, should we say, drosu braucienu!
 Sofia, Bulgaria
 Affordability Lowdown: Topping Price of Travel's European 3-Star Traveler Index[1] for 2013—which compares the 
cost of a centrally located, well-reviewed three-star hotel, plus the cost of transportation, some activities, food and 
drink—Sofia, Bulgaria, earns the title of Europe's cheapest tourist city, coming in at under $50 a day (all prices 
mentioned are accurate as of press time). 
 Budget-Travel Challenges: Airfare to Sofia is somewhat expensive, and there aren't a ton of good alternative 
options, though Sofia does have connecting service from other European cities on low-cost carriers such as 
easyJet[2] and Wizz Air[3]. If you're thinking of relying on train or bus service from another, more affordable 
European entry point, know that it will likely be a long, long journey.
 Berlin, Germany
 Affordability Lowdown: While they're not among the absolute cheapest spring and summer airfares, flights to Berlin 
from the U.S. are definitely on the cheaper end of the spectrum, in some cases beating out flights to gateways such 
as Paris and London. But it's not until you take a look at accommodations costs that Berlin's affordability really 
starts to shine. Healthy competition among hostels and cheaper hotels keeps budget accommodations inexpensive. 
According to CNN[4], Berlin is also home to some of the world's most affordable five-star hotels, a definite perk for 
budget travelers seeking something more upscale. Even when you factor in food and activities, Berlin remains a 
bargain; in fact, the city made this year's European 3-Star Traveler Index[5], with an average daily cost of $108 per 
traveler.
 Budget-Travel Challenges: Right now, the euro is the primary challenge for budget travelers visiting Berlin. The 
Economist's Big Mac Index[6] suggests that the euro is overvalued by about 12 percent, meaning the exchange 
Europe's Most Affordable Cities for 2013
rate isn't maximizing value for travelers converting U.S. dollars. But it's not all bad news: Due in part to recent 
eurozone struggles, we're seeing exchange rates that are at least decent, compared to the high rates of the last five 
years. 
 Riga, Latvia
 Affordability Lowdown: In a country whose currency offers Americans an excellent exchange rate, Riga stands out 
as a city with plenty to offer even those on a tight budget. Hotels.com's Hotel Price Index[7] rates Riga the second 
most affordable city in Europe for accommodations, with an average price of about $82 per night. The city also 
scored top spots on Price of Travel's European Backpacker Index for 2013[8] and European 3-Star Traveler 
Index[9]. 
 Budget-Travel Challenges: Airfare to Riga tends to be more expensive than flights to other major European cities. If 
you're looking to save, you might consider booking a less expensive ticket to a city with connections to Riga via low-
fare carriers such as Ryanair[10] or easyJet[11]. When you're pricing this out, however, be sure to factor in all the 
added fees (including steep baggage and check-in fees) you'll incur by flying these low-cost carriers. And note that 
you may have to change airports, since low-cost carriers tend to favor smaller airports, sometimes in inconvenient 
locations. 
 Lisbon, Portugal
 Affordability Lowdown: Lisbon stands out among European destinations for its comparatively low spring and 
summer airfare prices. In fact, from San Francisco, average summer airfares were about half as much to Lisbon as 
they were to London. And according to Hotels.com's Hotel Price Index[12], year-over-year accommodations costs 
dropped by seven percent in 2012, bringing the average nightly price of a hotel down to $115. 
 Budget-Travel Challenges: As with Berlin, the biggest challenge in Lisbon is the euro itself, which doesn't offer as 
much value as some of the other currencies on this list. However, eurozone troubles have driven the euro down 
enough that travelers exchanging U.S. dollars will still find decently good value. 
 Kiev, Ukraine
 Affordability Lowdown: Kiev is the affordable capital of a country we recently named one of our 10 Places You 
Should Go While They're Still Cheap[13]. The European Backpacker Index for 2013[14] puts the daily cost of 
accommodations, food and drink, and some activities and transportation at a mere $26. And according to The 
Economist's Big Mac Index[15], the Ukranian hryvnia is undervalued by nearly 50 percent against the dollar, giving 
travelers even more spending power.
 Budget-Travel Challenges: Its off-the-beaten-path location offers a lot of benefits, but it also equates to higher 
airfare prices. A lack of service from low-cost carriers means that savings options are limited, so if you're looking to 
save, keep an eye out for airfare sales from larger carriers serving the country.
 Istanbul, Turkey
 Affordability Lowdown: Spring and summer airfare prices from the U.S. to Istanbul are consistently among the 
lowest to Europe. While this might seem surprising, given that a flight from the U.S. to Turkey is much longer than a 
flight to, say, Madrid, it actually makes a fair amount of sense: Istanbul has become a worldwide air hub (and 
earned itself a top spot on our Destinations to Watch in 2013[16] because of it), with plenty of competition to keep 
costs low. And attesting to its wealth of budget accommodations, Istanbul secured a place on the European 
Backpacker Index for 2013[17].
 Budget-Travel Challenges: Unless you're willing to fly between cities, Istanbul is pretty far off Europe's beaten path, 
so combining a trip there with stops in other European cities isn't a simple matter of a Eurail Pass or a bus ride. And 
while Istanbul is wallet-friendly for those who are cost conscious, it's a trendy destination full of restaurants, bars, 
and cafes, so it can get expensive quickly if you decide to live it up. 
 Prague, Czech Republic
 Affordability Lowdown: Its popularity over the last decade has caused prices to rise somewhat, but Prague can still 
be an impressively affordable city, particularly for backpackers willing to settle for modest accommodations. The 
European Backpacker Index for 2013[18] puts the daily cost of on-the-cheap lodging, food, drinks, and activities at 
just $41 per day. Even those not willing to scrimp to save should be able to find good deals: Hotels.com's Hotel 
Price Index[19] puts the average price of a hotel in Prague at $107 per night. And everyone can still toast the 
appealingly low cost of celebration—PintPrice.com[20] reports that the price of a pint of beer in Prague averages 
$1.06.
Europe's Most Affordable Cities for 2013
 Budget-Travel Challenges: If the last time you visited Prague was more than a decade ago, you might find prices 
much higher than on your last visit. The key is to keep it in perspective: The city may no longer be a total steal, but 
it's still a great deal. And with so much to offer, it's still more than worth the uptick in cost. 
 Budapest, Hungary
 Affordability Lowdown: There's a lot that stands out to make Budapest an affordable European destination. Its 
currency, the forint, offers solid value to Americans[21] abroad. It's easy to eat, drink, and sightsee on a budget. 
And at the end of the day, you won't have to spend much for a decent place to stay: Budapest receives high 
affordability marks for backpackers and budget travelers, and even when you factor in more expensive hotels, the 
average cost of a night's stay in Budapest still comes in under $100. Plus, many of the thermal spas that make the 
city famous are affordable enough to work into any trip. For instance, at Dandar Bath[22], discounts on 
Wednesdays drive the admission price down to about $4.
 Budget-Travel Challenges: Airfare to Budapest is often (though not always) on the expensive end of the U.S.-to-
Europe airfare spectrum. However, Budapest is about three hours by train from Vienna, which in a spot check had 
slightly lower fares for spring and summer flights than Budapest. And the city is well connected to other European 
cities by low-cost carriers, including airberlin[23], easyJet[24], and Ryanair[25].
 Krakow, Poland
 Affordability Lowdown: Krakow has affordability all sewn up. Its currency offers U.S. travelers good value right now. 
It ranks high on accommodations-affordability rankings. In fact, it's the third-cheapest city on the European 
Backpacker Index for 2013[26] and the fourth-cheapest on the European 3-Star Traveler Index[27], with daily 
average lodging and travel costs of $25 for backpackers and $58 for budget travelers. And here's another thing 
Krakow has going for it: The Polish airline LOT[28] has been running periodic fare sales for flights from New York or 
Chicago to Krakow. These sales tend to run for a short time only, but they offer some really impressive deals on 
airfare (for instance, $712 round-trip, including taxes and fees, for a May flight). 
 Budget-Travel Challenges: If you want a really great airfare to Krakow, you'll likely have to work for it by keeping 
tabs on sales and even thinking creatively about connecting cities. If you've traveled around Poland before, you 
might consider Krakow a bit pricey in comparison to the rest of the country. But the city offers such a rich density of 
historic buildings (it was spared much physical damage in World War II) and attractions that it seems only fair. 
 Vilnius, Lithuania
 Affordability Lowdown: It's a city Lonely Planet[29] colorfully calls "eccentric and soulful," and one that offers the 
best overall hotel prices in all of Europe. According to Hotels.com's Hotel Price Index[30], Vilnius in Lithuania has 
an average per-night hotel price of $80, putting accommodations costs within reach of budget travelers. Sweeten 
the pot with a favorable exchange rate, quirky attractions, and Europe's largest baroque old town, and you've got an 
intriguing and affordable destination.
 Budget-Travel Challenges: We found a few exceptions, but in general, airfare from the U.S. to Vilnius tends to be a 
bit more expensive than to bigger European airports. However, since low-cost carriers, including Ryanair[31] and 
Wizz Air[32], serve area airports, it's worth doing some comparison shopping before resigning yourself to a higher 
fare.

International tourism officials warns of excessive taxes

Apr 16, 2013 (CANA News:http://feeds.feedblitz.com/prorsscan Delivered by Newstex)
 PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad: A senior international tourism official has warned that increased taxes on air 
transportation and tourism will damage economies and reduce travel to destinations such as the Caribbean.
 Addressing the 24th annual Caribbean Conference on Sustainable Tourism Development (STC-14) here on 
Monday night, Carlos Vogeler, the regional director for the Americas within the United Nations World Tourism 
Organization (UNWTO), said taxes on tourism are an all too common occurrence.
 'While properly constituted taxes and duties are a fundamental and a legitimate fiscal tool of governments 
worldwide, there is a growing concern regarding a proliferation of levies on both air transport and tourism.
 'While the industry should naturally contribute its due, this trend can actually produce a net damage to the 
economy, particularly in those destinations which are so dependent on air travel, such as the Caribbean.'
 Vogeler said that in many cases, taxes and duties were a clear market distortion and a trade barrier as they 
hamper fair competition between destinations.
 He said a clear example is the United Kingdom's air passenger duty (APD) which has been 'sold' as a 'green' tax, 
when in reality there is no link to investment in green technologies or offsetting.
 'This is contrary to the objectives of supporting development as it creates an obstacle to the economic growth and 
job creation in many regions around the world, namely in the Caribbean
 'This issue needs to be addressed, as with connectivity, by collectively positioning the benefits of air transport and 
tourism, with cross-silo analysis and guidance to States on the impact of taxes and other levies and by searching, 
as much as possible, for global solutions that ensure a level playing field. '
 The APD, instituted in 1994, is a British environmental tax aimed at offsetting aviation's carbon footprint. In its initial 
stage, it was set at £5 (US$7.85) per person, but has increased significantly over the years.
 Regional governments have been lobbying London to remove the tax, which they said negatively affects the growth 
of the tourism industry since the Caribbean has been placed in a band that makes travel to the region much more 
expensive than travelling from London to the United States.
 Last year, St Lucia Prime Minister and former Caribbean Community (CARICOM) chairman Dr Kenny Anthony 
expressed disappointment that the United Kingdom had 'opted to retain its discriminatory approach'.
 A new report, commissioned by four airlines, British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, has said that 
scrapping the controversial APD could generate 60,000 jobs by 2020.
 Trinidad and Tobago's Acting Prime Minister Winston Dookeran, who addressed the opening ceremony of the 
STC-14 conference, said that the APD 'continues to have a deleterious effect on Caribbean economies, especially 
those who have traditionally depended on the UK tourism market.
International tourism officials warns of excessive taxes
 'Governments of the Caribbean deem this tax a discriminatory one, given that the Caribbean has been placed in a 
band that makes travel to the region much more expensive than travelling from London to the United States,' he 
added.
 Dookeran said that repeated representations have been made to the British authorities at the highest level, but 
these have been to no avail.
 'We must, as a unified group, continue to lobby very strongly for a call of cation on the part of the British authorities, 
as we continue the dialogue on the sustainability of tourism in this most tourism-dependent region in the world, the 
Caribbean'.
 The four-day conference is being organised by the Barbados-based Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) and 
the Trinidad and Tobago government. It is being held under the theme ''Keeping the right balance: enhancing 
destination sustainability through products, partnerships, profitability'.
 Vogeler said that the tourism industry continues to be a major sector for socio-economic development worldwide, 
including the Caribbean, noting that there are over 200 million people unemployed around the world and 'we need 
to create 600 million new jobs over the next decade to sustain economic growth and maintain social stability'.
 He said while the global economic situation remains fragile and instability continues in certain parts of the world, a 
recent report from the World Economic Forum pinpointed wealth gaps and unsustainable government debts, as the 
main risks that the world is facing in 2013.
 'But there is yet another powerful 'mega-trend' of globalization at play in this new world, which often goes 
unnoticed, despite the fact that it involves a growing global population and, if disrupted, could turn around a good 
part of the evolution accomplished, and that is travel and tourism. A sector, which in these challenging times, 
emerges, just as technology and mobility, as a major driver of our new socio-economic model.'
 He reminded delegates that in 1950 only 25 million tourists travelled internationally, while that figure had grown to 
one billion 60 years later.
 'Never before have so many people travelled to so many places and fewer places on the planet have escaped the 
curiosity of the traveller,' had he said noting that these visitors generate more than a trillion US dollars in exports for 
countries they visit annually and that one in every 12 jobs are connected to the tourism sector.
 'These numbers are impressive but it is the impact of tourism on the ground that is far more relevant.
 Indeed, tourism means jobs, business opportunities for small and medium enterprises, the renewal of urban and 
rural areas and, if managed in a sustainable manner, the preservation and promotion of a country's natural and 
cultural heritage,' he said, noting that the conference here provides a great opportunity 'to ask ourselves what this 
global force, travel and tourism, can do to help us navigate successfully through current challenges'.
 He said there was also need for the tourism industry to adequately deal with issues such as climate change and a 
statement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon last year that the sector is especially well-placed to promote 
environmental sustainability, green growth and the struggle against climate change through its relationship with 
energy.
 Vogeler said that the hotel industry accounts for 21 per cent of the carbon emissions from tourism and in 2008, 
UNWTO launched the Hotel Energy Solutions Project for the accommodation sector.
 'Today we can provide hoteliers across the world with a free electronic software to assess their energy 
consumption and propose them the most profitable investment alternatives in terms of energy efficiency and 
renewable energies.'
 He said this year World Tourism Day on September 27 will be dedicated to 'Tourism amp; Water - Protecting our 
Common Future
 'This will be a unique opportunity to shine a spotlight on water both as an asset and as a resource and on the 
actions needed to face up to the water challenge.
 'Water is one of tourism's main assets. Each year, millions of people travel around the world to enjoy water 
destinations both inland and in coastal areas and the Caribbean destinations play a key role in this.
 'Water is also one of tourism's most precious resources, and as one of the largest economic sectors in the world, it 
is the responsibility of the tourism industries to take a leadership role and ensure companies and destinations invest 
in adequate water management throughout the value chain. If managed sustainably, tourism can bring benefits to 
the national and local communities and support water preservation.'

 If you're a boomer, you're old enough to remember when flying was a treat. Those days are long gone. Today, air 
travel is on par with colonoscopy prep. The hoped-for synergy of combining air carriers has not panned out. 
Instead, Continental's highly-touted customer service has succumbed to United Airlines chip-on-the-shoulder 
mentality. AirTran has taken the spirit of fun out of Southwest. Soon, we'll have a single airline that specializes in 
poor customer service. I have the perfect image for the planes -- a snarling, winged greyhound. 
 The airlines are eliminating flights and jamming more seats into their glorified sardine cans. Soon, they'll employe 
pushers to shove the passengers in so they can close the cabin doors. The litany of purser instructions will include 
a directive that we inhale and exhale in unison. They'll play a video of a yogi to assist the uninitiated. 
 I'm often relegated to the middle seat, squashed like a cartoon character as my fellow passengers ooze into my 
personal space. But there are treats in store for us. We may soon have the option of saving a few bucks by 
standing during flight. RyanAir has designed a "standing-room only" seat just for you[1]. If you'd like a seat belt, 
bring your own.
 Airlines now post à la carte ticket prices. It's only after you invest 15 minutes online that you're privy to the actual 
cost of the trip. Extra fees are big business. In 2011, airlines earned a staggering $22.6 billion worldwide in 
"ancillary revenue," up 66% from two years earlier[2]. We're being nickeled and dimed to death with add-on fees for 
everything from food, to early boarding to checked bags. Want to fly without having your knees impaled in your 
chest? Pay for "extra legroom." Need to change your itinerary? Not so fast. After listening to an endless loop of 
Musak, you'll be connected to India and informed that you'll pay $150 to $200 for the privilege. 
 Still, the airlines worry about their public image. So, they've taken to cheating. They pad their flight times to feign 
on-time performance. They claim they lose fewer bags. Yet, we all know they have fewer suitcases to lose since 
more of us are jamming our Rollaboards into the overhead bins.
 We are not happy campers. Passenger complaints rose by 20% from 2011 to 2012. [3] The depth of the public's 
animosity toward flight personnel became clear recently when the TSA announced its inexplicable decision to allow 
passengers to carry pocket knives, baseball bats and hockey sticks on board. The proposed change elicited an 
immediate outcry from the flight attendants' union. Were they worried about terrorists? No. They envisioned irate 
passengers knifing them in the back or high-sticking them in the face as they dispense beverages[4]. 
Understandably so. My recent travel debacles have left me fantasizing about sharp objects. 
 Don't feel too sorry for the flight attendants, though. According to George Hobica, founder of 
www.AirFareWatchDog.com[5], who surveyed his friends in the industry, they have their sneaky ways of evening 
the score[6]. It's all about getting us to go to sleep so we leave them alone and they can retire to their jump seats 
The Once-Friendly Skies are Now Plagued With Turbulence
and read People magazine. Did you know they pass off decaf coffee as regular, leave the seat belt sign on after the 
turbulence has passed to keep us in our seats and refuse upgrades after the cabin door has closed simply to avoid 
extra paperwork?
 There are indications that the airlines may have outsmarted themselves. According to a Consumer Reports 
survey[7], 40% of respondents said they're flying less due to the annoying add-on fees. Sadly, until the command 
"Beam Me Up, Scotty" works, commercial airlines are the only game in town for everyone but the super-rich. 
 Do you have any tricks for making the best of the current state of air travel?

 Airbus challenges Boeing with first quarter order boost
Airbus challenges Boeing with first quarter order boost

 European planemaker Airbus looks set to challenge Boeing (BA.N) for top place in the order race in the first quarter 
after falling behind its US rival in 2012, data showed on Thursday.
 Swelled by a previously revealed $24 billion order from Indonesia's Lion Air, Airbus reported 431 orders, up 
fourfold from the first three months of last year and well above the 193 orders Boeing registered for the period to 
March 26. Airbus announced separately that it had boosted production of the A330, a passenger jet which has 
enjoyed a renaissance thanks to delays to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to a planned record level of 10 a month. 
However, it also suffered a setback in its corporate jet business as the data revealed one of two private customers 
for the future A350 - billed as Europe's answer to the lightweight Dreamliner - had canceled. Lion Air's order for 234 
narrow body A320-family airliners, signed in front of French President Francois Hollande last month, fuelled a 
debate over whether new Southeast Asian airlines are soaking up too much capacity.
 Plane makers generally insist that demand from carriers like Lion Air, already one of Boeing's largest customers, 
underscores the transport needed to support some of the world's liveliest economies. But some bankers have 
warned of an order bubble. Last month's orders also included confirmation, as expected, of a 16-plane deal from 
Hawaiian Airlines. Airbus is targeting 700-750 plane orders in 2013, down from 914 in 2012 as a two-year surge in 
order activity triggered by new fuel-saving medium-haul models starts to wind down. Adjusted for cancellations, net 
Airbus orders totaled 410 planes in the first quarter. Boeing logged 191 net orders between the start of the year and 
March 26, the latest period for which the US figures are currently available.
 Boeing's figures do not yet include a $16 billion deal for 175 jets secured from Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) in March, 
potentially leaving the US firm in sight of Airbus' total. Orders are generally assessed over the calendar year, but 
analysts say Boeing's return to the industry's top spot last year signaled an increase in confidence and softened a 
crisis over 787 battery problems. Airbus, the plane making subsidiary of EADS (EAD.PA), meanwhile, said it had 
delivered 144 aircraft in the first quarter, including four Airbus A380 superjumbo. Boeing expects to out-deliver

 Norwegian Air Shuttle, Europe's third-biggest budget airline by revenues, is counting on growing numbers of Asian 
tourists to fill its seats as its fleet nearly triples to between 150 and 200 aircraft over the next seven years.
Currently, nine out of 10 passengers on flights between Europe and Asia are European, but in a decade or two, that 
picture will have been reversed, said Bjørn Kjos, chief executive.
The airline currently has 74 aircraft flying from several operational bases in Scandinavia, Spain and the UK to 120 
destinations in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
Norwegian is currently the second largest airline in Scandinavia, the third largest low-cost airline in Europe, the 10th 
largest airline in Europe and the 10th largest low-cost carrier in the world.
Mr Kjos said last month that strong growth in the Asian-originating leisure market meant he had little concern about 
overcapacity even as he and rivals put in big orders for new aircraft.
"Just look at who's been making money in recent years," he says. "It's the low-cost carriers, and they own their 
fleets. The legacy carriers have suffered huge losses."
"If you place an order now, you'll have to wait until 2020 before you can get a new aircraft," he says. "So it's better 
to order too many. If I find I've got too many, I'll just lease some of them to other airlines."
Last year, it had almost 18 million customers, a number set to soar as its fleet almost trebles over the next few 
years, on the back of what Mr Kjos describes as "the largest aircraft order in European aviation history" for 222 new 
Airbus and Boeing aircraft valued at some $22 billion, signed in January last year.
These orders have come after Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, made a deal to buy 175 narrow body 
Boeing jets, followed by significant orders from Turkish Airlines, Lion Air and Lufthansa.
To make sure Norwegian stays in the game, Mr Kjos has decided to compete in the low-cost long-haul market, 
initially with direct flights from Scandinavia to New York and Bangkok, then over time through a yet-to-be-
established Asian subsidiary.

 Wall Street now knows something of the psychological hell endured by that poor fellow who had to hear endless 
repetitions of "It's A Small World After All[1]." The stock market's tour of woe took in first Cyprus, then Italy, before 
ultimately ending up Down and Out in Paris and London[2], with British and French gross domestic product both 
contracting 0.3%.
 Some equities did buck a bad tape. Red Lion Hotels (RLH) rose 2.93%, though the baby sea lion who loafed 
around in a hotel chair[3] was even cuter. Facebook (FB), up 3.51%, was "friended" and analyst Budd Bugatch 
made the acquaintance of Mattress Firm Holding (MFRM), his bullish research recommendation[4] sending it 
surging some 12.09%.
 As for the Nabors (NBR), they were pretty profitable too, gaining 2.34%. Note to North Korea: better start making 
nice with your southern border[5].
 This is the last day of the first quarter on Wall Street, with the US bond market set for an early 2:00 p.m. Eastern 
close ahead of the Good Friday holiday, when there will be no trading in equities.
 This morning's economic data includes the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for March, due out at 9:45 a.m. In 
earnings activity, Accenture (ACN), BlackBerry (BBRY), GameStop (GME), Mosaic (MOS), Signet Jewelers (SIG), 
and Winnebago Industries (WGO) are all expected to report results.
Advantage Oil and Gas (AAV): TD Securities takes the energy outfit to Buy from Hold.
Eagle Materials (EXP): Sterne Agee moves the cement related stock to Buy from Neutral.
Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG): The accommodation name gets a Buy-from-Hold hoist at Investec.
Ryanair Holdings (PINK:RYAAY[6]): The budget airline based in Ireland and headed by a constantly controversial 
CEO[7] gets a Buy-from-Neutral boost at Citigroup. Even amid the continent's economic crisis, its stock has risen 
14.95% in the past 12 months, and the equity is advancing further before this morning's opening bell as a result of 
the upbeat analyst action.

 Easter bonnets? Markets were more concerned with Europe constantly going cap-in-hand. (Or rather Red Hat 
(RHT) handy, with that stock sliding some 3.84% as we speak.) While Cyprus implodes, anything Athens appears 
to be doing just fine. 
AOL Inc. (AOL) employee Arianna Huffington, née Stassinopoulos, saw her stock ride bullish research[1] to 
advance 8.38%. This as General Mills (GIS) hit the highest level in its history on high hopes for its Greek yogurt 
while the heirs of Aristotle Onassis at Diana Shipping (DSX) enjoyed a 12.62% jump.
 Italy, the land shaped like a boot, continues to implode but Ugg boots maker Deckers Outdoor (DECK) gained 
4.60% even as fellow footwear firm Skechers USA (SKX) surged some 6.09%. Its heartwarming homeless story 
seems ever more sketchy[2], however.

 The Boeing Company (BA[1]) has received an order-commitment from Irish low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc 
(RYAAY[2]) to deliver 175 units of Next-Generation 737-800 airplanes. This assurance is part of Ryanair's fleet 
expansion program and has the potential value of $15.6 billion at list prices, if exercised.
 Boeing has a long-standing alliance with Ryanair and aims to meet its commitments in terms of maintaining 
product standard along with delivery timing. Ryanair is one of the major operators of the 737-800 airplanes, having 
more than 300 units. The airline took delivery of its first 737-800 airplane from Boeing in 1999.
 The Boeing Next-Generation 737-800 airplanes came into service on Sep 5, 1994. This model continues to be a 
pillar of strength for Boeing in the commercial airplane sector. Steady demand for this model is primarily driven by 
fuel efficiency and lower operating costs compared with other models. The single-aisle aircraft can accommodate 
162-189 passengers and can fly approximately 3,000 nautical miles (3,452.3 miles).
 To cope with the anticipated higher demand, the company increased the production rate of this airplane twice in 
the recent past. Boeing aims to increase production to 38 from 35 airplanes per month from the second quarter of 
2013, and subsequently increase it to 42 airplanes per month next year.
 As of Mar 12, 2013, net orders received by Boeing for 737, stands at 138 airplanes. The delivery of Next-
Generation 737 in full-year 2012 reached 415 units, making it the company's highest selling model.
 During fourth-quarter 2012, top-line contribution from Boeing's Commercial Airplane segment rose 32% year over 
year along with net orders booking of 394 airplanes. At the end of 2012, the company's backlog was more than 
4,400 airplanes valued at a record $319 billion.
 Chicago-based Boeing Company is a premier jet aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest defense contractors 
in the U.S.
 The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks from the sector that are also performing well 
presently include Ducommun Inc. (DCO[3]) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Lockheed Martin Corporation 
(LMT[4]) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

boeing-for-175-airliners/23142 Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings said Tuesday it has signed an agreement with 
Boeing to purchase 175 737-800 airliners for around $15.6 billion (12 billion euros).
In a statement, Ryanair said the deal would allow it to expand its fleet to more than 400 airplanes by 2018, when 
the last of these jets are to be delivered, and boost the airline's traffic to more than 100 million passengers by 
March 2019.
The low-cost carrier currently has a fleet of 305 Boeing 737 passengers jets, 75 of which will be replaced by the 
new aircraft.
The purchase agreement - which Ryanair said was the largest-ever aircraft order from a European airline - was 
signed in New York by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray 
Conner.
According to Ryanair, the deal will create more than 3,000 new jobs across the airline and sustain thousands of 
skilled manufacturing jobs at Boeing and its suppliers.
Although the agreement still must be approved by Ryanair's shareholders, O'Leary said the Boeing 737-800s have 
been the 'cornerstone' of the airline's success thanks to their 'great engineering and phenomenal reliability.'
These aircraft are capable of transporting between 162 and 189 passengers on short- to medium-haul flights and 
are equipped with luxury features such as leather seats and Wi-Fi.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Ryanair had opted to purchase the 737-800s instead of the Boeing 
737 Max, a new family of aircraft currently under development.

 Quick TakeBoeing bagged a $15.6 billion order for 175 Next Generation 737s from Irish carrier Ryanair. On the 
same day, Airbus bagged a $24 billion order for 234 A320s from Indonesia-based carrier Lion Air. So far in 2013, 
Boeing and Airbus are going head-to-head in new commercial airplane orders. This is in sharp contrast to 2012 
when Boeing led Airbus by a comfortable margin.
 Boeing[1] (NYSE:BA) gained an order commitment on Tuesday for 175 narrow body Next Generation (NG) 737-
800 airplanes from Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair. This deal upon approval from Ryanair's shareholders will more 
than double the number of narrow body airplane orders that Boeing has received so far in 2013. At list prices this 
deal is valued at $15.6 billion.
 Interestingly, this order came on the same day that Airbus bagged a mega order worth $24 billion for 234 narrow 
body airplanes from Indonesia based low-cost carrier Lion Air. Lion Air was until now seen as a reliable Boeing 
customer as it operates an all Boeing fleet and had last year placed a large order for 201 narrow body Boeing 
737MAX airplanes, but its shift to Airbus reveals that severe price competition between these two leading aircraft 
manufacturers continues to persist.
 We currently have a stock price estimate of $82 for Boeing[2], approximately 5% below its current market price.

Market Share Gains Force Boeing And Airbus To Resort To Aggressive Pricing
 Airlines typically avoid changing aircraft manufacturers for their airplane fleets as operation of a single aircraft type 
brings cost synergies in training and inventory management. However, Airbus' recent order from Lion Air which 
operates an all Boeing airplane fleet, and Boeing's order last year from SilkAir which operates an all Airbus fleet, 
point to the presence of steep price discounting offered by both Boeing and Airbus in order to gain market share.
 Boeing And Airbus Continue To Fight For Market Share With These New Orders
 These orders from Ryanair and Lion Air belong to the narrow body (single aisle) segment of the global commercial 
aviation industry. This segment sees the highest production and sales volume of any other commercial aviation 
segment, and competition here between Boeing and Airbus is intense. In this segment, Boeing's 737 series 
competes with Airbus' A320 family of aircraft.
 Last week Boeing announced that it rolled out the first 737 at an increased production rate of 38 airplanes per 
month with plans to raise this rate further to 42 airplanes per month in the first half of 2014. In comparison, Airbus 
already produces A320s at a rate of 42 airplanes per month and is currently contemplating raising this even higher. 
Airbus And Boeing 's Battle For The Skies Heats Up With Big New Orders
Both of these airplanes also have huge backlogs. While Boeing's 737, excluding the under development 737MAX, 
had 1,951 unfilled orders at the end of February 2013, Airbus' A320, excluding the under development A320neo, 
had 3,689 unfilled orders through February 2013.
 Overall, so far in 2013, total commercial airplane orders for Boeing stand at 366 (including the order from Ryanair) 
and those for Airbus stand at 396 (including the order from Lion Air). This is in contrast to 2012 when Boeing led 
Airbus from the start and ended the year with 1,203 orders compared to Airbus' 833.

website 
1stairportparking.co.uk has published the monthly update of its popular Gatwick parking[2] pages. This has 
revealed that car parking prices are already up ahead of the popular Easter holiday period, with those who have 
booked flights or holidays over Easter recommended to book their parking now, or risk paying up to 30% more.
 Comparing the cost of seven days Gatwick parking booked in February for the Easter period to the cost of booking 
the same week in March revealed that prices have already increased by 10 - 20% for the cheapest parking. They 
report similar increases across the board at meet and greet and on airport car parks.
 As the most popular off Gatwick car parks fill up and early booking discounts expire, these prices are expected to 
continue to rise. For example, to stay in the airportamp;aposs long stay car parks for a week costs £104 for those 
who drive up and pay (who do not pre-book), with the same car parks costing from around £72 for bookings made 
at least 7 days in advance. This saving of over 30% will be lost by those who fail to act soon and book their Easter 
parking. 
 1stairportparking.co.uk pricing expert Lynn Bradshaw said; "A number of airlines including Ryanair and easyJet 
can look forward to record passenger numbers at Gatwick this Easter. Holiday companies will also be busy at what 
is traditionally the start of the busy summer period. Our advice to those who have already booked a flight or holiday 
but who have not booked their Gatwick car parking is that they should compare prices and book as soon as 
possible."
 "The cost of parking at Gatwick rises the closer the booking date is to the date of travel, just as it does for last 
minute flights, hotels and many other travel items. This is especially the case for cheaper or popular car parks, for 
meet and greet parking and for the on airport car parks, as the pre-booking discount is removed."
 "We are already seeing that the cheapest parking at Gatwick for a stay this Easter was more expensive when 
booked in March than it would have been if booked in February. We expect that prices continue to rise in the 
coming weeks, so it is time to compare prices and lock in the best deal Gatwick parking if you are travelling this 
Easter."

 Airbus sells 234 planes to Lion Air in $24 billion deal
Airbus sells 234 planes to Lion Air in $24 billion deal

Mar 18, 2013 (Today's Zaman:http://feeds.feedblitz.com/prorsstzamn Delivered by Newstex)
 Airbus has signed a 18.4-billion-euro deal ($24 billion) with low-cost Indonesian carrier Lion Air for 234 single-aisle 
passenger planes, poaching one of archrival Boeing's fastest growing customers.
 French President Francois Hollande's office on Monday called the deal with Lion Air, traditionally a client of Boeing, 
'the biggest for Airbus in terms of the number of aircraft and the overall sum.'
 The contract for the A320 planes trumped that between Lion Air and Boeing in 2011 for 201 planes worth $22 
billion. Lion Air has been rapidly growing its fleet to meet the need for medium-haul jets servicing the growing 
aviation market in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. Shares in Airbus parent EADS were down 
1.3 percent on Monday, roughly in line with a wider decline in France's benchmark CAC40 .FCHI index.
 The landmark order includes 109 A320neo and 64 A321neo planes — with the neo designating the newest fuel-
saving type of the narrow-body jets — as well as 60 A320 'classic' planes. While below a recent peak, airplane 
demand remains robust as airlines and lessors modernize fleets in a bid to drive down fuel costs, while emerging 
markets continue to grow strongly.
 Indonesia's 17,000 islands and relatively robust economy, well insulated from Europe's financial crisis, have made 
the world's largest archipelago a magnet for aircraft sellers. Its domestic aviation market, serving the world's fourth 
largest population, is growing at 21 percent annually.
 However, there have been suggestions growth is cooling, prompting some carriers to buy aircraft only to lease 
them out. In deals totalling $35 billion, Germany's Lufthansa last week ordered 102 Airbus and Boeing jets, Turkish 
Airlines picked up 82 from Airbus and Ireland's Ryanair is expected to sign for 170 Boeings.
 The values represent official prices but in practice, strategic airlines win significant discounts for big orders. The 
Lion Air order marks at least the third attempt by Airbus to woo Lion Air, long seen as a fortress for Boeing. It is 
likely to throw the spotlight on an intense battle for market share between the largest planemakers.
 It is also likely to add zest to a regional battle for supremacy between Lion Air and AirAsia, the low-cost carrier 
founded by Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes. Lion Air is about to start up a domestic Malaysian rival to 
AirAsia, which has long been exclusively an Airbus operator. Some industry watchers have warned of a potential 
price war.
 The airlines are respectively among the top buyers of Boeing and Airbus jets. Airlines rarely switch suppliers 
because of re-training costs and the burden of keeping extra spares, but the practice of 'flipping' has grown as 
market share battles raged.
 The Lion Air deal will be signed at the launch of France's 'Industry Week' as part of efforts to boost domestic 
manufacturing. Airbus aircraft are built mainly in the planemaker's founder nations France, Germany, Spain and 
 Airbus sells 234 planes to Lion Air in $24 billion deal
Britain. Boeing outsold Airbus in 2012 for the first time in six years and remains ahead this year, according to 
monthly data.

 Brussels: In Lithuania, as well as in a number of the other European Union (EU) countries, laws towards youth 
employment are discriminatory. On Thursday, in European Council meeting in Brussels President Dalia 
Grybauskaite said that the removal of discrimination was one the major measures for youth unemployment 
reduction.
 Grybauskaite assured that more funds for youth unemployment reduction will be allocated in new 2014-2020 
multiannual financial perspective. The president says that great examples of youth unemployment reduction are 
Austria and Germany.
 'Unfortunately, in most countries laws towards young people are discriminatory and the recommendation goes like 
this: remove discrimination on your own. Whether Brussels has to explain how to live and what to do with our 
youth?' says Grybauskaite.
 EACH RULING POLITICAL POWER MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS - GRYBAUSKAITE
 Brussels: In the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday, Dalia Grybauskaite said that each ruling state 
and political power must take responsibility for its actions, otherwise crisis was inevitable.
 'There is one conclusion: no government is dismissed from political responsibility and, in particular, in times of 
crisis and issues are not only based on the general recommendations, not on what Brussels says to do, but each 
country still has to take responsibility, each ruling political power must take responsibility for what it does and after 
all, it does not matter which recommendations we take. If countries do not implement them - the crisis is inevitable, 
'said Grybauskaite, Thursday evening after the European Council meeting.
 The president says that the examples of all the other countries showed that the result of such crisis is social 
tension caused by political disagreements and lack of responsibility.
 LITHUANIA'S PM SURE THAT SUSPENDED PIPELINE TENDER WILL NOT PREVENT TIMELY LNG 
CONSTRUCTION
 Vilnius: Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius is sure that liquefied gas terminal (LNG) will be finished on time and 
the pipeline tender that was put on suspension will not cause any troubles.
 'We hope that the court will soon make decisions but if the case was pending for 60 days, it would for sure cause 
threat and danger. However, I think that it will not happen - it is a strategic state project known to the judges. They 
will also assume responsibility while making decisions (). I am 100 percent sure that everything will go according to 
plan, 'said the PM after a meeting with LNG terminal supervisory commission.
 Butkevicius says that it is the only issue in LNG terminal construction. All the other works are on time and an 
agreement on the construction of quay is to be signed next week.

 LITHUANIA ENVIRONMENT MIN DOES NOT KNOW WHEN GOVT DECIDES ON SHALE GAS EXPLORATION
 Vilnius: Lithuanian Minister of Environment Valentinas Mazuronis says that so far it is not yet clear when the 
Government makes the final decision whether to authorise shale gas exploration in Lithuania.
 The minister highlights that he personally supports both shale gas exploration and extraction, yet, according to him, 
all opinions must be taken into account.
 Mazuronis says that the date of the final decision on exploration depends on when Prime Minister Algirdas 
Butkevicius includes the issue on the Government's agenda.
 'We are in no rush. We want to wait for the answers from the Academy of Sciences. When we have arguments 
from both sides, the Cabinet will have to choose () the Seimas' committees on environment and economy will also 
have their own discussions. Then the final decision will follow,' the minister said Friday.
 The minister of environment stressed that he was personally in favour of shale gas exploration and extraction. 
According to him, his visit to the U.S.A to the shale gas extraction sites convinced him that it is a good idea.

 LITHUANIAN, RUSSIAN - TWO MOST COMMON MOTHER TONGUES IN LITHUANIA
 Vilnius: In the 2011 census, residents for the first time could indicate two mother tongues. One mother tongue was 
indicated by 98, two - by 0.6 percent of the population, Statistics Lithuania said.
 Most residents indicated the tongue of their ethnicity as their mother tongue: 99.2 percent of Lithuanians consider

each tenth - aged 65 and older.
 MORE LITHUANIA'S UNIVERSITY GRADUATES CHOSE STUDIES IN VOCATION SCHOOLS
 Vilnius/Siauliai: University graduates are choosing education at vocational schools. The main argument - practice is 
more important than theory. Not only universities but also general education schools feel increasing competition 
with vocational schools.
 'A few used to come to study in our school after graduating colleges and universities. However, now we count in 
tens, 'said Head of Siauliai Vocational Education and Training Centre Saulius Darguzas.
 This year more than ever school leavers enrolled to the centre, more than 500. Teachers think that the main 
reason is the desire to gain practical knowledge. 'How construction engineer will supervise workers and organize 
work if he had not ever held a brick in his hands? There will be misunderstanding, 'said Darguzas.
 In total this year 34 students who graduated from universities and 25 - colleges study in Siauliai Vocational 
Education and Training Centre. The majority of students who graduated from higher education schools study in 
trade and business section - 22, while 15 in electronics and administration and 11 in construction and mechanics.
 Soviet time stereotype that it is not prestigious to study in vocational school, or it is a place for losers is changing 
rapidly.
 LATVIA POSITIONED TO REPLACE ESTONIA AS EUROZONE'S FASTEST-GROWING ECONOMY - ERNST 
amp; YOUNG
 Tallinn: The Latvian economy is set to be the new darling of the eurozone and will gain considerable momentum 
when it joins the monetary union next year, according to Ernst amp; Young Baltic partner Ivar Kiigemagi.
 Last quarter, economic growth in the three Baltic countries outpaced all other EU member states, with Latvia in the 
lead, followed by Estonia. Estonia, however, is the only one of the three that is in the eurozone.
 A fresh Ernst amp; Young report forecasts 3 percent GDP growth for Estonia in 2013 and 4 percent in 2014. 
Latvia's 2014 outlook is looking even better, on course to again outpace Estonia's economy next year, according to 
Kiigemagi.
 'Estonia will only enjoy its place as the top student in the classroom until Latvia joins,' Kiigemagi said. And Latvia 
will not have to fear the soaring inflation that Estonia faced when it joined the eurozone, according to the analyst.
 'While in Estonia, the changeover to the euro coincided with several other important changes in the economy, 
Latvia's changeover, it currently seems, will not be accompanied by major inflation,' Kiigemagi said.
 MP Aivar Soerd, a former finance minister, lauded progress by Latvia, which is currently up for evaluation for 
joining the eurozone. 'As with Estonia, Latvia has carried out responsible budget policies and the addition to the 
eurozone of a country with sound finances will add value to the monetary union as a whole [amp;] Latvia's 
accession to the euro area is also in the interests of Estonia and Lithuania because it adds confidence to this 
economic region and will bring new investments to the Baltic states,' Soerd said.
 LATVIA LISTED AMONG TOP 5 UNFRIENDLIEST COUNTRIES FOR TOURISTS
 Riga: Latvia is among the top five unfriendlierst countries for tourists, according to the Travel and Tourism 
Competitiveness Report 2013 by the World Economic Forum.
 The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013 ranks 140 countries according to attractiveness and 
competitiveness in the travel and tourism industries. Bolivia, Venezuela, Russia, Kuwait and Latvia are listed as the 
top five unfriendliest countries for tourists.
LITHUANIAN HIGHLIGHTS 5677
 At the other end of the scale, Iceland, New Zealand, Morocco, Macedonia and Austria are ranked the world's most 
welcoming nations for visitors. Estonia is ranked 50th, Lithuania - 112th.
 Latvia's overall position in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report is 48th - three places up from 2011. 
Estonia is ranked 30th, down from 25th place in 2011, whereas Lithuania is in 49th place, up from 55th in 2011.
 Excellent tourism infrastructure and facilities, business travel appeal, sustainable development of natural resources 
and rich cultural resources are among the key factors in landing the highest positions in the rankings.
 Safety/security, underdeveloped infrastructure and concerns about sustainable development are among the factors 
bringing down countries' competitiveness.
 The report emphasizes the need for continued development in the travel and tourism sector particularly for its role 
in job creation in a relatively stagnant global economy. The industry currently accounts for one in 11 jobs in the 
world.
 The report uses data compiled from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey and hard data from 
private sources and national and international agencies and organizations such as the ICAO, IATA, UNWTO, World 
Bank/International Finance Corporation, IUCN, WHO and UNESCO.
 CHOSEN PATH IS THE RIGHT ONE - ESTONIA'S PM IN BRUSSELS
 Tallinn: Estonian prime minister Andrus Ansip, who is attending the European Council meeting in Brussels, said at 
the end of the first day of the meeting on Thursday that the expected debate between either the direction of cuts or 
stimulating growth did not emerge at the meeting of the heads of governments and states, Aripaev Online reports.
 'Actually that debate didn't happen,' said Ansip. 'Everyone found that the chosen path is the right path. 
Economising measures have to be continued but these economising measures cannot kill economic growth'.
 Ansip said at the meeting that the obligations member states have taken have to be fulfilled and all that has been 
agreed upon earlier must be adhered to. The principles of the stability and growth package that were just recently 
strengthened cannot be weakened. 'These are the basis for creating new jobs,' he said, as reported by the 
government's press office.
 He said that the majority of member states have started implementing reforms and real results can already be 
seen. 'The euro area is standing on a much firmer basis now than a year ago,' said Ansip.
 ESTONIA'S TALLINK MIGHT LEAVE STOCK EXCHANGE
 Tallinn: Rumours have started circulating that Estonian passenger shipping company Tallink might leave NASDAQ 
OMX Tallinn, which has boosted the price of the attractive share, Eesti Paevaleht reports.
 The past six months have been very successful for the company in regard to financial indicators - first Tallink 
Grupp fulfilled the aim to pay dividends. Namely the company had included in April 2011 in its strategy a provision 
that it would pay dividends when loan burden is at an optimal level. That specified level was achieved in the third 
quarter of last year and the concern's board member Andres Hunt told Aripaev on March 1 that the company is 
working in the name of paying dividends and wishes to announce of it to investors as soon as possible.
 Second, in the middle of December, an unexpected announcement was made that 15.73 percent of the company's 
shares were bought from five large shareholders of Tallink by Baltic Cruises Holding, who is a subsidiary of one of 
the shareholders of Tallink, CVCI Growth Fund II. Besides the remarkable volume, over 116 million euros, the 
transaction was special since the investor paid 1.10 euros per share which exceeded the price at that time by 42.3 
percent. The price being higher than market price and the ban Baltic Cruises Holding enforced against other major 
owners to buy more shares till April 30, immediately sparked rumours that the company might leave the bourse.
 Last Friday, Baltic Cruises Holding bought 5.25 million shares more from funds and major investors, paying 1 euro 
per share and boosting its stake to 16.5 percent. On Thursday, Tallink's share gained 2.88 percent to close at 1 
euro, which is the highest level in five years.

deposits above €100,000. Meanwhile, a government spokesman told Reuters[3] the parliament would reject the

 DUBLIN — There's finally some good news for Boeing: European discount airline Ryanair announced Tuesday it 
will buy 175 of the company's popular 737 jets, the largest order ever placed by a European carrier.
Chicago-based Boeing Co. has struggled ever since its new 787 Dreamliner was grounded by regulators in January 
following problems with its electrical system. It also was dealt a major blow Monday in the race to win the single-
aisle plane market when Indonesia's Lion Air signed a deal with rival Airbus for 234 A320s.

 Low-cost and low-fare airline GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL[1]) reported weak air traffic for Feb 2013. 
Revenue passenger kilometers or RPK - implies revenue generated per kilometer per passenger - for the month 
declined 17.8% from the corresponding month prior year to 2,417.8 million. While revenue from domestic grounds 
registered a 20.3% drop, international RPK improved 10.1%.
 Available seat kilometers (ASK) - that measures an airline's passenger carrying capacity - fell 15.3% year over 
year to 3,776.4 million, with domestic decline of 19.2%. On the international front, ASK moved up 29.7%.
 Load factor on the domestic arena fell 90 basis points (bps) and internationally it plunged 1,020 bps. On a 
consolidated basis, the load factor was 64.0% compared with 66.0% recorded in Feb 2012.
 For the reported month, the passenger revenue per available seat kilometer (PRASK) increased by 14% as a result 
of the reduction in the domestic market supply. Also, fuel prices for the month increased roughly 16% year over 
year.
 Performance within the boundaries of the country was negatively impacted by the channeling of domestic capacity 
to overseas routes and the freeze of The Boeing Company's (BA[2]) 737-300 aircraft services, following the 
suspension of Webjet operation, last November.
 Activities in the international market remained impressive as a result of expansion of GOL's operations to newer 
destinations like Santo Domingo, Miami and Orlando.
 Latin America based GOL currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company is expected to perform well in the 
coming months based on its strategies of route expansion, lucrative acquisitions and collaborations with other 
prominent market players. These are expected to create significant operational synergies, resulting in higher 
revenues.
 However, we stay cautious due to competitive threats, international business risks, increased operating expenses 
along with lower demand and appreciation of the U.S. dollar against Brazilian real.
 Other Stocks
 Other airline stocks worth considering include Zacks Ranked #1 Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[3]) that has a 
Strong Buy rating as well as Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL[4]) that currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 JetBlue Airways (JBLU[1]) has struck a one-way codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways. Via this pact, the two 
companies will connect their networks at New York's JFK International Airport and Washington Dulles International 
Airport.
 The deal, pending government approval, will allow flyers to board both Qatar and JetBlue flights with a single 
combined ticket. Customers will also enjoy the benefits of one-stop check-in and baggage transfer.
 Very soon, customers can purchase Qatar flight tickets at JetBlue-operated spots in 26 markets between New York 
and Washington Dulles. International destinations that JetBlue customers can reach with the help of Qatar Airways' 
connecting service are places in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific regions. Specifically, apart from Bangkok, 
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Kuwait, Riyadh, Islamabad, Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the deal includes 12 
cities in India.
 On the other hand, JetBlue acts as a prominent domestic carrier at JFK and has 150 departures each day to 
numerous major metropolises - Boston, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Orlando, San Francisco and San 
Juan. From Washington Dulles, the airline operates flights to Boston, New York, Long Beach and Oakland
 Following the receipt of regulatory nod, tickets for a combined JetBlue-Qatar Airways travel plan will be made 
available at various travel, reservation and company websites.
 The top-level JetBlue executive expressed optimistic views regarding this collaboration with Qatar Airways, which 
has earned a name for superlative in-flight products and strong operational excellence. The airlines are interline 
partners since 2011 and remain committed to customer satisfaction.

 JetBlue Airways (JBLU[1]) reported single-digit traffic growth for Feb 2013 on the back of higher capacity. The 
company's airline traffic - measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs, which implies revenue generated per 
mile per passenger - increased 2.6% year over year to 2.51 billion for the month. Consolidated capacity (or 
available seat miles/ASMs) was 3.04 billion, up 1.3% from Feb 2012.
 The load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers was 82.4%, up 100 basis points. Passenger revenue 
per available seat mile (PRASM), however, dropped 3% year over year. The company registered a completion 
factor of 96.1%, with on-time performance of 68.8%.
 For the first two months of 2013, on a consolidated basis, JetBlue Airways generated RPMs of 5.30 billion (up 
6.9% year over year) and ASMs of 6.46 billion (up 5.7% year over year), while load factor was 82.0%, reflecting an 
improvement of 90 basis points.
 In an attempt to expand its services, JetBlue Airways is consistently introducing new flights. From Nov 20, the 
company will have two non-stop flights every day from Chicago's O'Hare to San Juan. Leveraging the reputation of 
being the largest carrier in Puerto Rico, the airline flies to 14 non-stop destinations within U.S. and Caribbean from 
the capital.
 JetBlue Airways also remains committed toward re-vamping the city's Luis Munoz Marin International Airport and 
extend all necessary inputs for the growth and development of the island.
 Going forward, JetBlue Airways aims to start services in Albuquerque, N.M.; Philadelphia; Penn and Medellin, 
Colombia. We believe adding on new routes enhances the company's business model and strengthens its network 
against other group members such as Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL[2]) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[3]).
 JetBlue Airways currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Other Stocks to Consider
 A stock operating within the airline sector that is worth considering is Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY[4]) - that holds

 Who needs an iPod when broken records are all the rage? Another day, another 2.16% tumble in Apple (AAPL), 
but no matter, for the Dow (^DJI) rose to a record. Those last six words now accurately describe stock market 
action for six straight days. 
Boeing (BA), upgraded this morning, added on another 1.47% to finish at a fresh half-decade high on reports in an 
Irish newspaper that Dublin's own Ryanair (PINK:RYAAY[1]) is about to reveal a 200-airplane order. (If the latter is 
that flush with cash, surely they can relax their fee-to-pee policy[2]. Although since so many post-Saint Patrick's 
Day bladders will be in desperate need of Guinness evacuation on Sunday, that is actually shaping up to be the 
highest grossing day in its history.) 
Merrill Lynch (BAC) once famously had three different ratings on Merck (MRK) in a single day[3]. Less is more; its 
single upgrade[4] of the drug stock last week has sent it on such a run that yesterday shares surged more than 3% 
to best all blue chips by a mile.
 A downgrade[5] of Linux software leader Red Hat (RHT) saw it fall 4.78% in posting the Samp;P 500's (^GSPC) 
poorest performance. Linus Torvalds, inventor of the eponymous operating system, said, "Software is like sex: It's 
better when it's free[6]." Many more performances like yesterday's and Red Hat's stock will soon cost nothing.
 The pace of economic data, previously quiet this week, picks up with January business inventories due out at 
10:00 a.m. Eastern. In earnings action, Adecco (PINK:AHEXY), Cathay Pacific Airways (PINK:CPCAY), Coldwater 
Creek (CWTR), E.ON (PINK:EONGY[7]), Express (EXPR), Guess (GES), Kronos (KRO), Men's Wearhouse (MW), 
TravelCenters of America (TA), and Vera Bradley Inc. (VRA) are all expected to report results.
ABB Ltd. (ABB): The European industrial giant is now Buy from Neutral at Nomura.
Affiliated Managers (AMG): Goldman Sachs gives the money manager a Buy-from-Neutral upgrade.
Boeing (BA): BBamp;T Capital Markets moves the Dow (^DJI) member, trading at new half-decade highs, to Hold 
from Underweight.
Coach Inc. (COH): Citing renewed upscale consumer spending and a risk:reward ratio that is now better balanced, 
Citigroup boosts the handbag maker to Buy from Neutral with an intact objective of $56. Shares are currently up 
almost 2% in pre-market trading as a result.
Diamond Foods (DMND): Jefferies juices its investment opinion to Hold from Underperform on account of the 
company's margin improvement capability. The price objective, previously $11, is now $15.
Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS[8]): Maybe there is indeed truth in advertising[9]. Shares in the credit card 
company, already up 36.87% in the past year to stand atop a fresh peak, are moved to Outperform from Market 
Stock Upgrades: Here's Why It Pays to Discover
Perform at FBR Capital. Secular transaction volume gains are seen arising from the shift of payment transactions 
from cash and check to plastic and electronic methods. The price target is also taken up, by $6 to $48.
DreamWorks Animation (DWA): The stock is now Hold from Sell at Stifel Nicolaus, which now has higher hopes for 
its movie Croods.
Genesco (GCO): GCO gets upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Jaffray, which hat-tips its impressive long 
term earnings ability. Its price objective increases to $73 from $62.
Oracle (ORCL): Canaccord raises its rating to Buy from Speculative Buy amid expectations that revenue at the 
hardware division will improve over upcoming quarters. Its price objective is $42, and shares are according edging 
up ahead of this morning's market open.
Prologis (PLD): The stock is now Outperform from Neutral at Cowen.
Republic Services (RSG): BBamp;T Capital hoists the waste management name to Buy from Hold.
Summer Infant (SUMR): Shares are now Strong Buy from Buy at Needham, which cites cost cutting efforts among 
other catalysts.
Walgreen (WAG): Impressed with its exposure to healthcare reform, UBS upgrades the stock to Buy from Neutral at 
UBS. Its target price is hiked to $48 from $41.

 March 12--[           http://business.blogs.starnewsonline.com/23088/ge-could-land-another-huge-aircraft-engine-
order/ryan1-2/]
 Irish budget-carrier Ryanair could be close to announcing a deal for 200 Boeing 737 aircraft, and that could mean 
lots of new work for GE Aviation's [           http://www.geaviation.com/]Castle Hayne plant.
 The 
Irish 
Independent 
[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ryanair-to-buy-200-boeings-in-18bn-order-
29123271.html] reported Tuesday that the mega aircraft deal, valued at nearly $18 billion on the books -- although 
airlines making large orders usually get substantial discounts, will be announced Sunday at the White House when 
the Irish prime minister visits Washington.
 That also happens to be St. Patrick's Day.
 Ryanair [           http://www.ryanair.com/en], a European version of U.S. low-cost carrier Southwest, has been 
growing rapidly in Europe. And like Southwest, the carrier operates a single aircraft type -- the Boeing 737 [           
http://www.boeing.com/commercial/737family/]. It currently has more than 300 737s in its fleet.
 According to the newspaper, it was unclear which version of the 737 Ryanair would opt for.
 But either the 737-800 or the re-engined 737-Max, which would offer more fuel efficiency, would still be good news 
for GE workers here. That's because engines manufactured by CFM International [           
http://www.cfmaeroengines.com/], a joint venture of GE and France's Snecma, are the sole power plant option for 
the 737.
 The local plant makes rotating parts for the engines.
 Like other recent orders, [           http://business.blogs.starnewsonline.com/22526/boeing-deal-means-ge-has-yet-
another-engine-order/] it's probably years off before parts for the Ryanair engines are made. But the order would 
add to the substantial work backlog at the plant.
 The Castle Hayne facility employs around 600.
 Several other GE divisions also have facilities on the sprawling campus off Castle Hayne Road near Interstate 140.

 Investors are shying away from stocks after a seven-day rally that brought post-crisis highs.
 After a yet another record high yesterday, Dow (INDEXDJX:.DJI[1]) futures fell 0.20% to 14,352. Futures on the 
Samp;P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX[2]) sank 0.21% to 1,547.30 and Nasdaq (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC[3]) futures declined 
0.29% to 2,797.50.
 With no major economic data releases today, politics might take center stage for US investors. This morning, 
Congressman Paul Ryan will introduce his budget proposal, which will seek to balance the budget through $4.6 
trillion in spending cuts. Mary Jo White and Richard Cordray, prospective candidates to lead the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, respectively, will face confirmation hearings in 
the Senate.
 Today, Germany confirmed that inflation rose at the slowest rate in over two years in February. Consumer prices 
rose 1.5% on a yearly basis, down from 1.7% in January. Inflation would have been 1.1% if not for increased food 
and energy prices. Modest inflation numbers like this could make a rate cut from the European Central Bank more 
likely. Bundesbank head and ECB member Jens Weidmann said today that inflation risk is also declining.
 Sterling declined today as UK factory orders unexpectedly fell 1.5% in January. Economists expected the indicator 
to stay flat. Industrial output also fell 1.2%, missing estimates of a 0.1% increase. These indicators raise the 
possibility that the economy shrinks again this quarter, officially putting the country in a recession. The data release 
proved positive for British stocks which rose on the hopes that more stimulus spending could be around the corner.
 Italy's political uncertainty is costing the country more in borrowing costs. At an auction today, Italy paid an average 
yield of 1.28% on 7.75 billion euros of one-year debt, the highest rate since December 2012. Spain's borrowing cost 
fell today. It sold 5.8 billion euros of one-year bonds for an average yield of 1.363%, down from 1.548% at a similar 
sale last month.
BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY[4]) shares extended yesterday's 14% gain in pre-market trading. The stock spiked 
after the head of China's Lenovo (PINK:LNVGY[5]) said that he would consider acquiring the Canadian company. 
The new BlackBerry Z10 smartphone goes on sale in the US next week.
 In a vote of confidence for Boeing (NYSE:BA[6]), Ireland-based Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[7]) placed an $18 
billion order with the American aerospace company. The company will buy 200 jets to update its fleet.
Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM[8]) shares rose this morning after reporting that China sales fell by less than expected. 
The parent of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell saw same-store-sales fall 20% in China as the country investigates 
the company's chicken quality. Previously, the company forecast a 25% drop in sales.
Pre-Market Primer: Futures Point to Rally's End
Costco (NASDAQ:COST[9]) net profit rose 39% in its fiscal second quarter. Revenue rose 8% to $24.34 billion. The 
wholesale outlet added members over the quarter, boosting membership fees 15% to $528 million.
Disclosure: Minyanville has a business relationship with BlackBerry.

 Latin American carrier Copa Holdings SA (CPA[1]) posted impressive revenue and air traffic results for the month 
of Feb 2013.
 Consolidated revenue passenger miles or RPMs for the month grew 17.4% from the prior-year quarter to 1,086.2 
million. Although domestic revenue from passenger miles registered a 12.8% year-over-year decrease, 
internationally RPM improved 18.8%.
 Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) were 1,423.8 million, up 16.9% year over year, with international growth of 
18.3% offsetting the 12.5% drop in the domestic arena.
 Load factor on the domestic front was down 30 basis points (bps), while on the international field it registered a 30 
bps growth. On a consolidated basis, load factor stood at 76.3% compared with 76.0% recorded in Feb 2012.
 For the first two months of this year, on a consolidated basis, Copa generated RPMs of 2,351.4 million (up 19.5% 
year over year) and ASMs of 3,013.8 million (up 19.1% year over year), while load factor was 78.0%, reflecting an 
improvement of 30 basis points.
 The passenger and cargo services provider failed to match our expectation on the earnings and sales fronts in the 
fourth quarter of 2012, although the results grew on a year-over-year basis. The company's operating income also 
declined from the prior-year quarter's results due to an increase in fuel charges coupled with a decline in operating 
revenue per available seat mile.
 In the coming months, Panama-based Copa expects to benefit from the various strategic initiatives targeted to 
boost the profitability level. These include expanding the company's horizon by increasing the flight frequencies, 
revising the fleet structure and reaching out to new destinations.
 During 2013, the company is slated to add seven new The Boeing Company's (BA[2]) 737-800 Next Generation 
aircraft to its fleet. Designed with attractive and advanced Sky Interior, these new jets will bring the company's total 
fleet to 90 aircraft.
 Copa currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
 Other Stocks
 Other stocks operating within the airline sector that are worth considering are Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY[3]) 
and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW[4]). Both the firms currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 Ryanair is one of the largest low cost carriers in passengers carried terms in Europe offering some of the lowest 
fares in the industry. It set a precedent by introducing ancillary revenues, a great revenue generator that rival LCCs 
and schedule carriers have embraced alike. As the financial crisis has reduced the appeal of business or premium 
travel, the company is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that these difficult trading conditions 
have created.

Nok Air Flight Attendants: Airline Looking For Young Females, Friendly, With No Braces

 Nok Airlines is hiring flight attendants, and it's being pretty specific about what type of ladies fit the bill. According to 
a post on the Thai airline's Facebook page[1], applicants must not be older than 25, must have a weight in 
proportion with their height, must speak English and must exhibit professionalism and friendliness. Oh, and they 
must not wear braces. 
Nok Airlines/Facebook[2]
 Nok Air made headlines not long ago when it had Maxim models pose for a sexy airline calendar[3]. (And you 
thought Ryanair already had the market cornered[4] on that one!). 
 This also isn't the first time flight attendant issues have left people shaking their heads. Back in February, flight 
attendants from Korean airline Asiana were fighting for the right to wear pants[5]. And, in 2011, another Asian 
airline, Garuda Indonesia, made waves when flight attendant hopefuls accused it of inappropriately handling their 
breasts in medical exams[6]. 
 But hey, being a flight attendant can be a great career path[7].

 American Airlines, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR[1]), announced its plans to expand its operations in the 
domestic as well as international markets, starting this summer. The new services will extend to San Diego, from 
the Miami hub, and Mexico, from its Dallas/Fort Worth hub.
 The new flights will start operating from Jun 12, 2013. There will be as many as 25 flights daily from Miami to San 
Diego with 150 seats, undertaken with a Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 Services in Mexico will now include two new destinations: Ignacio Pesqueira Garcia International Airport in 
Hermosillo (HMO) and General Leobardo C. Ruiz International Airport in Zacatecas (ZCL). Operated with the 44-
seater ERJ-140 aircraft, services between DFW and HMO will be offered once a day, while there will be flights from 
DFW and ZCL three times a week.
 Late last month, American Airlines filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation seeking 
permission to start new services between the U.S. and Brazil. Subsequent to the approval of the same, American 
has plans to start flights from Los Angeles and Sao Paulo and Chicago O'Hare and Sao Paulo in late 2013 and in 
2014.
 Last month, another airline, United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL[2]), also made public its plans to start new 
services from its Denver hub to Dickinson, N.D., with effect from Jun 6, 2013. It is believed that new flights will 
expand the company's network capabilities as well as tap significant market opportunities.
 AMR Corporation currently bears a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other stocks worth a look in the airline industry 
are Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (RJET[3]) and Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYAAY[4]); both holding a Zacks Rank #1

20 CEOs Who Aren't Afraid To Speak Their Mind
20 CEOs Who Aren't Afraid To Speak Their Mind
The Business Insider
March 4, 2013 Monday 6:00 PM EST

Mar 04, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Many CEOs carefully cultivate a quiet and considered public image, limiting contact to quarterly earnings calls or 
the occasional carefully-considered interview. 
 Then there are the others. The CEOs who aggressively advocate for their company on every stage imaginable, 
take political stances, and make gaffes.
 At best, these outbursts are distracting. At their worst, these leaders can damage their company's brand and lose 
customers.
 We've broken out some of the most outspoken and occasionally controversial heads of large corporations. News 
Corporation CEO Rupert Murdoch
 The News Corporation founder and CEO frequently sounds off on his conservative political views through his 
twitter account.[1] 
 On Google: "Piracy leader is Google who streams movies free, sells advts around them. No wonder pouring 
millions into lobbying."
 On President Obama: "Yesterday Obama went off script, showed real self ie government omnipotent, individuals 
secondary. Must be big damage."
Titan International CEO Maurice Taylor
 Taylor recently got into a public spat with the French government after failing to come to an agreement to save a 
factory. He sent a letter to the country's Minister of Transforming Productivity, heavily criticizing[2] the French work 
ethic and unions.
 From the letter:[3] "I have visited the factory a couple of times. The French workforce gets paid high wages but 
works only three hours. They get one hour for breaks and lunch, talk for three, and work for three. I told this to the 
French union workers to their faces. They told me that's the French way!"
AXS TV chairman Mark Cuban
 The investor, technology executive, and sports mogul is unafraid to weigh in on everything from presidential 
politics[4] to Wall Street.[5] He's been fined more than a million dollars by the NBA for statements about the league 
and officiating.
20 CEOs Who Aren't Afraid To Speak Their Mind
 From a 2012 interview:[6] "Wall Street used to be a place where you can raise capital to grow businesses. That's 
not the case anymore. Wall Street has become a platform for hackers."
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary
 O'Leary runs a popular Irish budget airline. He's prone to making bombastic, sometimes expletive-laden 
statements and the occasional personal attack, which have landed him in legal trouble more than once. 
 The Telegraph collected[7] a few of his best quotes:
 "Anyone who thinks Ryanair flights are some sort of bastion of sanctity where you can contemplate your navel is 
wrong. We already bombard you with as many in-flight announcements and trolleys as we can. Anyone who looks 
like [they're] sleeping, we wake them up to sell them things."
 "I think the most influential person in Europe in the last 20 to 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher, who has left a 
lasting legacy that has driven us towards lower taxes and greater efficiency. Without her we'd all be living in some 
French bloody unemployed republic."
Westgate Resorts CEO, David A. Siegel
 David A. Siegel, founder and CEO of Westgate Resorts and one of the richest men in America told his employees 
that if President Obama were to win the election, that he would have "no choice" but to reduce the size of the 
company.[8]
 Siegel's letter to employees, from the HuffingtonPost[9]:
 "The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job[10] however, is another 4 
years of the same Presidential administration. Of course, as your employer, I can't tell you whom to vote for, and I 
certainly wouldn't interfere with your right to vote for whomever you choose...If any new taxes are levied on me, or 
my company, as our current President plans, I will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company."
 (Not only didn't he fire anyone, he gave all of his employees raises[11].)
 Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman
 Founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management recently, Ackman participated in a live brawl on CNBC 
with billionaire investor [12]Carl Icahn.[13] The topic of conversation that fueled the fight was Herbalife, a multi-level 
marketing firm that sells nutrition products, which Ackman had called a pyramid scheme at a recent conference[14]. 
Ackman basically called his rival a hypocrite on live television in an attempt to tarnish his image.
On Herbalife: [15]
 "If the FTC misses Herbalife, it's the equivalent of the SEC missing Madoff."
 "After 18 months of work and assistance of some of the top law firms in the country we've concluded that it's a 
pyramid scheme."
 On Carl Icahn:[16]
 "The big issue about Carl Icahn, is he's not used to someone stepping up to him." 
 "What I thank Carl for is he helped highlight issues with Herbalife." 
 
Whole Foods CEO John Mackey
 Whole Foods CEO, John Mackey is a professed libertarian and isn't shy about taking public stances on issues he 
cares about. During an NPR interview[17] he claimed that Obamacare, which he had previously criticized as a form 
of socialism, was "more like fascism." 
20 CEOs Who Aren't Afraid To Speak Their Mind
 Here's the quote[18]: "Technically speaking, it's more like fascism. Socialism is where the government owns the 
means of production. In fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production, but they do control it — and 
that's what's happening with our health care programs and these reforms."
Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk
 Tesla Motors CEO, Elon Musk, is known for publicly bashing The New York Times when he called their review[19] 
of the company's Model S Sedan "fake." The review criticized the car's battery life because it did not last the length 
of a test drive. 
 From a 2013 [20]interview with CNBC[21]: "I mean, there are times when 'The New York Times' has, well, 
published articles that are less than accurate. And it's well-known [for] situations like that. And I think unfortunately 
this is one of those cases.
 "We explicitly said that to do this trip he needs to make sure he's fully charged when he starts up, that he doesn't 
take detours, and that he drives at a reasonable speed. I'm not talking about some ridiculously low speed. I'm 
talking about, you know, at least — not too far above the speed limit. And none of those three things were done. So 
if somebody's explicitly asked to take reasonable actions in a test drive and then blatantly doesn't, what conclusion 
is one supposed to reach?"
Abercrombie amp; Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries
 Abercrombie amp; Fitch CEO, Michael Jeffries, micromanages his company to an absurd degree by choosing 
every detail from the songs he plays in his stores to the underwear his employees use.[22] Jefferies also admits 
that his brand is exclusive and he wants to keep it that way. 
 From a 2006 piece at Salon:[23] "In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-
so-cool kids," he says. "Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great 
attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we 
exclusionary? Absolutely. Those companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, old, fat, 
skinny. But then you become totally vanilla. You don't alienate anybody, but you don't excite anybody, either." 
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison
 Ellison's Twitter account, from which he has only posted one tweet, already has 35,000 followers who hope to hear 
from the notoriously outspoken enterprise software chief.
 When Hewlett Packard fired then-CEO Mark Hurd, Ellison was not pleased.[24] "You are going to fire Mark 
Hurd[25] and hire Leo[26]? What I said at the time was that this was the best idea since the Apple[27] board fired 
Steve Jobs. Really brilliant."
 Ellison went on to hire Hurd himself. He's also accused[28] SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff of stealing the idea for 
NetSuite from him. 
Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son
 Softbank's CEO, Masayoshi Son, is known for aggressive business moves, like his $20 billion-dollar acquisition of 
Sprint. 
 During that deal, he issued a warning[29] to the other wireless carriers in the United States, saying "I am a man, 
and every man wants to be number one, not number two or number three."
Fiat and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne
 The Fiat and Chrysler CEO is something of a quote-machine, frequently making somewhat impolitic and 
controversial statements. Reuters reported[30] on one such incident at the Detroit auto show when Marchionne was 
discussing Alfa Romeo luxury sedans.
20 CEOs Who Aren't Afraid To Speak Their Mind
 "I cannot come up with a schlock product, I just won't," Marchionne told a room of journalists at the car show. "I 
won't put an American engine into that car. With all due respect to my American friends, it needs to be a wop 
engine."
 "There are some things that are well-done in Italy."
 After reporters registered evident surprise at his use of an ethnic slur, Marchionne turned to one of them and 
asked, "Why are you surprised?"
Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer
 Mayer is relatively new to the job, but she is already stirring up controversy. Most recently she has become a hot 
topic of conversation after a memo instructing Yahoo! remote employees to stop working from 
home[31] leaked. She is also well-known for her outspoken views on feminism[32] which have also recently been 
circulating around the Web. 
 On feminism, from a PBS/ AOL documentary:[33] "I don't think that I would consider myself a feminist. I think that, I 
certainly believe in equal rights. I believe that women are just as capable, if not more so, in a lot of different 
dimensions. But I don't, I think, have sort of the militant drive and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes 
comes with that. And I think it's too bad, but I do think feminism has become, in many ways, a more negative word. 
There are amazing opportunities all over the world for women, and I think that there's more good that comes out of 
positive energy around that than negative energy."
JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon
 Dimon is a full-throated defender of the banking industry, which has come under withering criticism in the aftermath 
of the financial crisis of 2008. From an interview with New York Magazine: [34]
 'Everyone is talking about the culture, the culture, and all that, and it's just not true,' Dimon says. 'Most bankers are 
decent, honorable people. We're wrapped up in all this crap right now. We made a mistake. We're sorry. It doesn't 
detract from all the good things we've done. I am not responsible for the financial crisis,' he adds. 'I hate to tell you. 
We were a port of safety in the storm. I find it unbelievable that that is the general theme — that you have to walk in 
a room and act like you are responsible for things you are not responsible for.'
Trump Organization CEO Donald Trump
 The real estate mogul is more than willing to weigh in on politics and the issues of the day, even considering a 
presidential run at one point. He was criticized for his support of the "birther" movement, which questioned the 
validity President Barack Obama's birth certificate. 
 In an August 2012 Twitter post[35]: "What's more dangerous for the country -- the Iranian nuclear threat or Barack 
Obama as President?"
AIG CEO Robert Benmosche
 AIG was one of the biggest disasters of the financial crisis and received a massive taxpayer bailout, so Benmosche 
received a great deal of criticism for this comment made to New York Magazine:[36]
 'But it (the AIG bailout) wasn't a free lunch,' Benmosche insists. It's a point of view that I am apparently not the first 
to fail to appreciate. 'Everybody said it's just not going to happen, they'll never pay it off,' he goes on. 
'SIGTARP, Elizabeth Warren, Gretchen Whatshername in the New York Times. The fact is we now have 
succeeded in getting the Fed back all of their money, and we're just close to getting the Treasury paid back. And do 
you know,' he adds, an indignant note creeping into his voice, 'neither of them have ever said 'Thank you'? We 
have done all the right things. Somebody should say, 'By golly, those AIG people made a promise and they are 
living up to a promise!'"
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff
20 CEOs Who Aren't Afraid To Speak Their Mind
 The enterprise software chief is known for elaborate and controversial[37] guerrilla marketing stunts, often aimed at 
chief rival Oracle[38]. He's not above the occasional grandiose statement, once comparing old software to Arab 
dictators.[39] 
 [In the Arab revolution] you didn't see signs saying 'Thank you Microsoft[40].' You didn't see signs saying 'thank 
you IBM[41].' ... We've seen Mubarak fall, Qaddafi fall. Not so long from now we'll hear about a corporate spring, an 
enterprise spring. When will the first corporate CEO fall for the same reason — because customers are rising up, 
they're not listening to their employees, they're not paying attention.
 And he's always willing to take a crack at his rivals. From the same conference, on Oracle:
 We need to beware of the false cloud. Because the false cloud, ladies and gentlemen, is not efficient! It is not 
democratic! It is not economical! It is not environmental! It is not the future.
Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn
 Wynn is so legendarily outspoken that his quarterly conference calls with analysts are one of the highlights of 
earnings season.[42] He's been particularly critical of the Obama administration.
 From a 2011 earnings call:[43] "I'm saying it bluntly, that this administration is the greatest wet blanket to business, 
and progress and job creation in my lifetime. And I can prove it and I could spend the next 3 hours giving you 
examples of all of us in this market place that are frightened to death about all the new regulations, our health care 
costs escalate, regulations coming from left and right."
Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang
 The head of the chip-maker has had a long-standing feud with rival Intel, once telling analysts[44] that "we're going 
to open a can of whoop ass" on the company. In the same call, he referred to Intel's graphics implementation as "a 
joke." 
 And he has some words of warning for any who would think about going toe to toe with him, telling the BBC[45], 
"Maybe this is a bit of my early schooling — I will never start a fight, but I will never walk away from one. So if 
someone is going to pick on me, they'd better think twice."
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer
 Upon learning that executive Mark Lucovsky was defecting to Google, Ballmer allegedly hurled[46] a chair across 
the room and unleashed a profanity-laced tirade on the company, with promises of revenge, saying that 
"Google's not a real company. It's a house of cards."
 Ballmer will take the occasional public crack at Google too, telling the Seattle Times[47] "I think Google is just 
another big company at this stage. It's not like they have the charm of smallness or pre-IPO-ness with them."
Bonus: former Yahoo! CEO, Carol Bartz
 Bartz's time as CEO of Yahoo! was relatively brief, clocking in at only two-and-a-half years, it was very intense and 
occasionally profane. She was never the type to mince words with competitors, journalists, or even her own team.
 From when she was first trying to turn the company around:[48]
 "So when I say product people we sort of had a one product management person for every three engineers. So we 
had a lot of people running around telling engineers what to do but nobody is f-ing doing anything. So, excuse me. I 
knew that would slip out one of these times."
 She's not any less outspoken now, saying about the board that fired her:[49] 
 "The board was so spooked by being cast as the worst board in the country. Now they're trying to show that they're 
not the doofuses that they are."

European Commission prohibits Ryanair / Aer Lingus deal

Mar 01, 2013 (Chillin' Competition:http://chillingcompetition.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Last Wednesday the Commission confirmed that it has decided to prohibit -for the second time- the proposed 
merger between Ryanair and Aer Lingus merger (click here for the press release[1]). This is the fourth prohibition 
decision adopted under Commissioner Almunia, and the 24th in the history of EU competition law.
 The decision has not yet been published. We had assumed that while we waited for it we could at least report on 
Michael O'Leary's (Ryanair's CEO) reactions. However, Mr. O'Leary has not made any public statements of the kind 
that we were expecting (remember his analogy [2]between the European Commission officials and North Korean 
economists? 
 Ryanair has issued a press release[3] in which it argues that its offer 'was supported by an historic and 
unprecedented remedies package that included not one, but two upfront buyers (BA/IAG amp; Flybe) to take over 
approximately half of Aer Lingus' short-haul business (…) The transfer to these upfront buyers of Aer Lingus' 
business on the 46 crossover routes identified by the EU Commission, together with the relevant slots, aircraft, 
personnel and branding, was ensured by binding, irrevocable commitments by those upfront buyers including Board 
approvals'. In Ryanair's view, '[t]he history of the EU's treatment of Ryanair's two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively 
proves that this prohibition is a 'political' decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government (a 
minority 25% shareholder in Aer Lingus) and is not one that is based on a fair and reasonable application of EU 
competition rules or precedent airline merger approvals in Europe'.
 We have no clue on whether the allegations over the political motivations of the decision are founded or not. But 
politics aside, this case resuscitates some tricky substantive/institutional questions. The nature and scope of the 
remedies proposed by Ryanair was indeed pretty substantial, and arguably unprecedented (Ryanair had even 
pledged to give 100 million to Flybe to ensure its sustainability) so, query:
 Are EU merger control rules on when an up-front buyer is a suitable one sufficiently clear? What discretion should 
the Commission enjoy in this regard? Ryanair has announced that it will appeal the decision before the General 
Court, so we should expect to have some answers to these question soon.

 The management at a Tennessee restaurant have gone to great lengths -- even enlisting the help of the local 
sheriff -- to track down a woman who allegedly failed to pay a $5 fee charged to non-patrons who use the business' 
restroom[1].   "I don't feel it was a crime,' Patricia Barnes, the woman accused of not paying before peeing, told 
Today.com.  Barnes told the news outlet that an employee of The Flood Zone in Erin, Tenn., gave her permission to 
use the bathroom but that she later received a handwritten note in the mail demanding that she pay up[2].   The 
restaurant's owner reportedly obtained Barnes' license plate number and went on to get her mailing address from 
the local sheriff.   Click over to Today for the full story.[3] 
  While some establishments view non-patrons using their restrooms as an inevitable annoyance, others don't take 
the issue so lightly. Patrons have also been known to react with frustration at being charged for facilities they feel 
should be free.  As the New York Times reported in 2011, when a Brooklyn barber shop started charging a $1 fee[4] 
for use of its restrooms, one woman was so outraged that she hurled insults at the barber and later returned to the 
shop with a large group, apparently meant as backup. The police ended up having to break up the fist fight that 
broke out.   After European airline Ryanair announced in 2010 that it intended to charge the equivalent of $1.30 for 
use of its bathrooms on flights, [5]customers were outraged. One professor was so miffed by the idea that he told 
ABC News he would protest the proposed policy by locking himself in a bathroom at the beginning of a flight and 
remain there until landing.   A second-grade teacher's rewards system for good behavior also backfired when it 
involved paying for bathroom breaks. The fake money students earned was to be put toward restroom trips that 
didn't fall within designated break times[6]. One child ended up wetting his pants because he hadn't accumulated 
enough "Boyd Bucks." The school district later acknowledged to NBCDFW.com that the program was a "bad 
decision."   Do you think it's fair for a business to charge for the use of its bathrooms? Share your thoughts in the 
comments, or tweet us @HuffPostSmBiz[7].

EU regulators thwart Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
EU regulators thwart Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus

Feb 27, 2013 (Deutsche Welle Business:http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)
 The EU Commission has foiled a third bid by budget carrier Ryanair to take over its Irish rival Aer Lingus, citing 
monopoly concerns. Ryanair has slammed the ban as politically motivated, vowing to appeal the ruling. The merger 
would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 routes, the EU Commission 
said in a statement released Wednesday.
 In the opinion of the European Union's executive arm, Ryanair's takeover of its smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus would 
have reduced choice and most likely would have led to price hikes.
 The decision came in spite of an improved remedies package from Ryanair, including divestitures on crossover 
routes, to allay regulators' concern of unfair competition.
 Noting that he was generally in favor of industry consolidation, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia 
said the remedies were simply inadequate to solve the very serious problems the acquisition would have created in 
the Irish aviation market.
 In 2007, Ryanair failed for the first time to take control of Aer Lingus, which was followed by a second takeover bid 
in 2009 which the low-cost carrier withdrew when it became clear that Brussels was still opposed.
 Ryanair vows to fight back
 Following the decision Ryanair said it would launch an appeal against the ruling, claiming it was politically 
motivated rather than based on competition concerns.
 Ryanair's latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the objections raised by the commission in its 
2007 prohibition decision, and resolved all competition issues raised in its 2012 statement of objections, the airline 
said in a statement Wednesday.
 Ryanair already holds a 30-percent stake in Aer Lingus and offered to buy out the Irish government's 25.1 percent 
stake in July last year. However, Dublin has rejected the offer.
 Aer Lingus welcomed the ruling by EU regulators, arguing it wanted to continue as a strong, standalone airline.

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1] Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (Feb 27) confirmed 
that it will appeal the EU Commission's announced decision to prohibit its latest offer for Aer Lingus, which was 
supported by an historic and unprecedented remedies package that included not one, but two upfront buyers 
(BA/IAG amp; Flybe) to take over approximately half of Aer Lingus' short-haul business. 
The transfer to these upfront buyers of Aer Lingus' business on the 46 crossover routes identified by the EU 
Commission, together with the relevant slots, aircraft, personnel and branding, was ensured by binding, irrevocable 
commitments by those upfront buyers including Board approvals.
 The history of the EU's treatment of Ryanair's two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively proves that this prohibition is a 
'political' decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government (a minority 25% shareholder in Aer 
Lingus) and is not one that is based on a fair and reasonable application of EU competition rules or precedent 
airline merger approvals in Europe.
 The 2007 EU Prohibition Decision
 In June 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's first offer for Aer Lingus on the basis that Ryanair's 
then remedies package:
 - did not deliver any upfront buyers or any guaranteed competitor entry; and
 - did not address all of the identified 35 crossover routes between Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair's 2006 offer for Aer Lingus was also hindered by the fact that Dublin Airport (with 24mppa and only one 
terminal) was found to be suffering congestion and entry constraints. 
 This is the context in which Ryanair approached the European Commission with its latest 2012 offer for Aer Lingus. 
Ryanair Will Appeal EU Commision's 'Political' Decision to Prohibit its Offer for Aer Lingus
 The 2012 EU Statement of Objections
 The Commission accepted that, since traffic had fallen (from 24m to 18m) at Dublin Airport and a second terminal 
had opened in 2010, there were no congestion issues as had existed in 2007. However, in its November 2012 
Statement of Objections, the EU Commission raised the following concerns: 
 - Ryanair's commitments did not cover all 46 crossover routes; 
 - The implementation of Ryanair's commitments was unclear because Ryanair had failed to demonstrate that 
upfront buyers would take up all of Ryanair's remedies;
 - Ryanair's proposed transfer of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots was legally unclear (despite the fact that Heathrow, as 
part of the Dublin-London city pair, did not require a remedy since this city pair was already served by two other 
strong competitors - BA and Air France);
 - Ryanair's signed Heads of Terms with potential upfront buyers were not irrevocable or supported by Board 
approvals; 
 - Ryanair's block space agreement (BSA) proposals, under which some crossover routes would be addressed by 
selling seats on Aer Lingus flights to a competitor airline, would not replicate effective competition;
 - There was no provision in the event of failed entry by upfront buyers;
 - There was a risk that Ryanair and the upfront buyers would not compete aggressively because of 'long term 
structural links'.
 Ryanair's Comprehensive and Final Commitments Package
 In February 2013 (after a series of meetings with the EU, and associated iterations of its proposals) Ryanair 
submitted a final remedies package which addressed both the shortcomings in its 2007 remedies package and also 
the concerns raised by the Commission in its November 2012 statement of objections. Its key final remedies 
included:
 - Instead of BSAs, Ryanair committed to transfer Aer Lingus flights on all 46 crossover routes to both BA/IAG and 
Flybe;
 - BA/IAG and Flybe signed irrevocable agreements with Ryanair that they would implement the upfront buyer 
(UFB) remedies package, including opening bases at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports;
 - Ryanair agreed to transfer Aer Lingus existing business and operations on 43 of the 46 crossover routes, together 
with aircraft, personnel, slots and all attendant assets, to Flybe; 
 - Ryanair agreed to transfer both slots and traffic on the remaining 3 of the 46 crossover routes to BA/IAG;
 - Ryanair removed any concerns over the transferability of Heathrow slots by agreeing to transfer both Aer Lingus' 
and Ryanair's Gatwick slots to BA/IAG so that BA could serve Dublin, Cork and Shannon from both Gatwick and 
Heathrow airports with no question mark over slot transferability or the implementation of the remedy;
 - Ryanair addressed the Commission's concerns about the commitment of Flybe to the Irish market by undertaking 
to deliver Flybe Ireland as a commercially profitable and viable entity, with an equity base of at least €100m to 
ensure that Flybe Ireland was sustainable for the long term;
 - Ryanair's remedies package also addressed the Irish Government's stated concerns by preserving Aer Lingus' 
operations (and connectivity) on the Dublin-Heathrow route (despite the fact that much of Ireland's connectivity now 
takes place on connecting services through Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports). The 
arrival of BA and Flybe Ireland also ensured that jobs in the sector would increase, not reduce;
 - Furthermore, Ryanair's remedies package resolved all 'potential' competition routes (i.e. those routes where 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus don't presently compete but might in the future) by offering slot divestitures, in perpetuity, to 
any other airline wishing to enter these potential competition routes.
 EU Market Test Response
 An EU DG Comp market test questionnaire related to Ryanair's final remedy package was circulated to relevant 
parties across Europe and showed that: (1) a clear majority of respondents agreed that the assets divested to Flybe 
Ryanair Will Appeal EU Commision's 'Political' Decision to Prohibit its Offer for Aer Lingus
were sufficient; and (2) EU airlines representing a majority of air passengers in Europe were supportive of key 
remedies proposed.
 Recent EU Airline Merger Approvals
 Ryanair's remedies package in the Aer Lingus case, which was supported by irrevocable upfront buyer agreements 
from BA/IAG and Flybe, was submitted to the European Commission after the Commission's recent approval of 
other similar airline mergers including BA/IAG's takeover of BMI at Heathrow. In that case, the EU Commission 
approved BA's purchase of BMI (in Phase 1) despite the fact that the two airlines were the number one and number 
two holders of slots at Heathrow. Following a 'phase one' merger review, the Commission accepted remedies from 
BA/IAG which involved the transfer of just 12 daily slot pairs to competitor airlines to operate competition on just 6 
routes from Heathrow. No upfront buyers were required and those slots that were offered up to competitors will not 
be taken up until 12 months after BA/IAG completed its takeover of BMI.
 Conclusions
 It is untenable for the Commission to argue on competition grounds why they have rejected what is an 
unprecedented and revolutionary remedies package in the Ryanair/Aer Lingus case just months after they had 
granted phase one approval to a similar IAG/BMI airline merger, which concerned the number one and number two 
airlines based at the heavily-congested London Heathrow Airport. 
 In the case of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which are the number one and number two airlines based in Dublin, Ryanair 
delivered a structural divestment remedy including, not one, but two upfront buyers, irrevocable and binding 
commitments from those two upfront buyers, divestiture of Aer Lingus' flights in each of the 46 crossover routes, 
together with offers of slot divestitures for an unlimited period of time on all other potential competition 
routes. Ryanair's latest remedies package conclusively addressed all of the objections raised by the Commission in 
its 2007 prohibition decision, and comprehensively resolved all of the competition issues raised by the Commission 
in its November 2012 statement of objections.
 On this basis, Ryanair concludes that it has no alternative to, and very good grounds for, an appeal of the 
prohibition decision to the European Courts. It is clear that Ryanair, as Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, is being 
held to a different and considerably higher standard by the European Commission than any other EU flag carrier 
airline. 
 Given that Ryanair's remedies package would have (1) resulted in not one, but two new competitor airlines opening 
bases at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports; (2) totally devolved more than half of Aer Lingus' short-haul business 
to these airlines; (3) ensured long term competition on these routes from two of the UK's largest and well known 
airline brands; and (4) addressed the Irish Government's stated concerns about Heathrow slots, connectivity, jobs 
and competition, Ryanair does not believe that its remedies package has been rejected for any reason other than 
pandering to the narrow (and misguided) political interests of the Irish Government.
 At a time when even Aer Lingus accepts that it has no long term independent future (its CEO, Christoph Mueller, 
stated in July 2011: 'We need partners to fulfil our mission to connect Ireland with the world. We are too small to do 
it on ourselves. So we need partnerships.') and at a time when the European Commission has rubberstamped 
every other significant EU airline merger in recent years with considerably fewer and less effective remedies than 
those proposed by Ryanair, this prohibition is clearly not based on EU competition rules or any EU airline merger 
precedent.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
Ryanair Will Appeal EU Commision's 'Political' Decision to Prohibit its Offer for Aer Lingus
 'The EU Commission has regrettably reversed its own precedents in order to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair's radical remedies package clearly addressed all of the concerns raised by the EU both in its 2007 
prohibition and in its November 2012 statement of objections.
 At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions (witness 
American Airlines' merger with US Airways last week and Emirates' recent strategic joint-venture with Qantas) the 
EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying much-needed 
consolidation. 
 This decision leaves Aer Lingus as a small, isolated airline and leaves the two Irish airlines at the mercy of the 
Government-owned Dublin Airport monopoly, which continues to increase passenger charges, deliver third-rate 
services and oversee traffic declines. Over the past 5 years, as Dublin Airport has doubled its passenger charges, 
its traffic has declined from 24m to 18m per annum, while Aer Lingus continues to get smaller as it: (1) wet leases 
short-haul jet aircraft to Virgin to operate new routes from Heathrow to regional UK airports (making no contribution 
to Irish tourism); (2) rents long-haul aircraft to charter companies outside of Ireland; and (3) transfers more and 
more of its short-haul routes to smaller, turbo-prop aircraft.
 Ryanair regrets that the EU Commission has again failed to apply its own competition rules and precedents in a fair 
and dispassionate manner. We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather 
than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this 
politically-inspired prohibition. Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive 
appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition.'

 BRUSSELS — The European Union's antitrust authority on Wednesday blocked Ryanair's renewed bid to take 
over rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, ruling that it would undermine competition and drive up ticket prices.
The merger of the two Dublin-based airlines would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a dominant 
position on almost 50 routes where Aer Lingus and Ryanair currently compete, said the EU Commission, the bloc's 
executive arm.

France Is Making High-Speed Rail Travel Incredibly Cheap
France Is Making High-Speed Rail Travel Incredibly Cheap

 In an effort to boost ridership on its high-speed rail system, France is offering a new low-cost service, with fares 
from the Paris suburbs to the Mediterranean coast for as little as €10 ($13).
 Ouigo[1] (as in "We Go"), an independently run subsidiary of the SNCF, France's national rail company, will begin 
operation on April 2. SNCF President Guillaume Pepy calls it the best high-speed rail deal in the world, according to 
La Tribune[2].
 Ouigo will operate its own trains, with more frequent service than the SNCF currently offers. To allow for such 
cheap fares, it will adopt the budget travel model offered by airlines like easyJet and Ryanair[3].
 That means cutting service and adding fees. Passengers can bring only one small bag (about the size of an 
airplane carry-on) and a purse or backpack.
 In a move reminiscent of Spirit Airlines' $100 carry-on bag fee[4], if a traveler waits until boarding time to pay for an 
extra bag, there's a €40 charge. If done ahead of time, the cost is only €5.
 Seating in a car with outlets costs an extra €2; getting information about a reservation via the phone requires 
another €1, according to Le Monde[5].
 Reservations can be changed for €10 (€20 if done on the phone), but not fully reimbursed, and there is no food or 
drink service on the train.
 Another tradeoff for taking Ouigo is that its Paris hub is in Marne la Vallée (where Euro Disney[6] is located) — a 
€7.30 trip from the city center on the RER, Paris' commuter rail system. Ouigo stations in Lyon, Marseille, and 
Montpellier are much more central.
 As Yonah Freemark at the Transport Politic points out[7], the SNCF has no competitors in the domestic market, 
and Ouigo is meant to target travelers who prefer driving to taking the train. (Many of those potential customers own 
their own cars and live in the Paris suburbs, so the extra RER trip is a minor factor.)
 Only 10 percent of all Ouigo tickets will be priced at €10; the rest will cost at most €85, according to Freemark. But 
for those travelers who snatch up the reduced tickets, it's an excellent deal — especially when France's expensive 
road tolls and gas prices are accounted for.

 And then there were four…major U.S. airlines that is. Last week, it was announced that American Airlines will 
merge with US Airways. Neither airline can be considered a strong business or a strong brand, but perhaps 
consolidation will finally lead to an improvement in business results and customer satisfaction. The only question to 
my mind is which of those two things is the chicken and which is the egg?
 The conventional wisdom is that airlines suffer from systemic problems that make it tough to run a successful 
business. This post[1] from Investopedia suggests four basic reasons why airlines struggle financially.
 1. Unprofitable airlines keep flying and so undermine demand for the other carriers
 2. Fixed and variable costs are high making it difficult to respond to changing market conditions
 3. Exogenous events can have a big impact on demand e.g. volcanic dust clouds
 4. Airlines have a reputation for hassle and bad service
 Bankruptcy, which would often see normal businesses shuttered for good, seems to be a safe haven from which 
the airline uses to effect cost efficiency plans and upgrades they could not afford otherwise. They then emerge from 
bankruptcy with the expectation of improved financial performance, but the same dismal customer service. What is 
the definition of madness? Doing the same thing repeatedly but expecting different results.
 Airlines in general have a low[2] customer satisfaction score by comparison to other industries and it is notable that 
the two smaller, value airlines - JetBlue and Southwest - achieve satisfaction scores significantly higher than the 
traditional carriers: Delta, US Airways, American and United Airlines. We saw exactly the same picture last time 
when we measured U.S. airlines in BrandZ back in 2011. Southwest was far better known than JetBlue, but both 
brands were meaningfully different from the competition and poised for growth. None of the legacy airlines came 
even close to matching the equity scores achieved by the value airlines, which were seen to be setting the trends 
for the category.
 Brands that fail lack a meaningful difference compared to their competition. They tend to be equally well-known but 
they are unable to establish positive and differentiating perceptions of the brand, particularly among the people who 
use them.
 Of course, you don't have to offer great service to make money in the airline business. Ryanair in Europe makes 
more money than British Airways, has a lousy reputation for service but it is well-known for being the cheapest. The 
problem with the traditional U.S. carriers is that they need to command a premium to keep flying, but are not able to 
Airline Brands And Low Profits
deliver the service necessary to justify that premium. Unfortunately, I am not sure the merger between American 
and US Airways is going to make any difference on that count.
 So what do you think? Is customer service the chicken or the egg when it comes to airline profitability? Please 
share your thoughts.

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (14 Feb) announced 
the purchase of a new office building in Airside Business Park in Swords, Co Dublin, which will become Ryanair's 
new Dublin office. The 100,000 sq ft building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations, including its commercial, 
customer service, finance, IT, legal and marketing departments.
 Ryanair will shortly begin the tendering process for the fit-out of the building and plans to move all of its Irish office 
operations and approximately 400 staff from its current offices at Dublin Airport to Airside before the end of 2013. 
Ryanair will also be offering up to half (50,000 sq ft) of this building for rent to other high profile multi-national 
companies who are looking for high spec offices in a great location, with ready access to Dublin Airport. Ryanair will 
continue to maintain some facilities at Dublin Airport for its pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: 'Ryanair is pleased to confirm the purchase of a new Dublin office building at Airside 
Business Park, Swords, Co Dublin. This brand new 100,000 sq ft state-of-the-art building will house all of Ryanair's 
Irish operations and some 400 staff will be based there when we complete our move before the end of 2013. This is 
a significant investment by Ryanair, allowing us the space and facilities to further develop our Dublin organisation, 
at much lower costs than the high rents on the Dublin Airport campus and allowing other staff currently housed in 
satellite offices to be brought together under one roof, resulting in a large reduction in rental expenses and further

 Eversheds and Cleary Gottlieb Steen amp; Hamilton have advised on a  150m (£128m) deal that could see airline 
Flybe acquire 43 short-haul routes operated by Aer Lingus.
The Irish carrier is currently subject to a  694m (£592m) takeover offer from budget airline Ryanair. However, the 
deal is under scrutiny by the European Commission due to concern a deal could create a monopoly on 46 routes 
out of Ireland. 
Eversheds and Cleary Gottlieb Steen amp; Hamilton have advised on a  150m (£128m) deal that could see airline 
Flybe acquire 43 short-haul routes operated by Aer Lingus.
 The Irish carrier is currently subject to a  694m (£592m) takeover offer from budget airline Ryanair. However, the 
deal is under scrutiny by the European Commission due to concern a deal could create a monopoly on 46 routes 
out of Ireland. 
 But ahead of any decision by the commission, Ryanair has struck a provisional agreement with Exeter-based Flybe 
that would see the latter set up a new business called Flybe Ireland in the event of a successful takeover bid. 
 Eversheds advised Flybe on the deal with a team led by corporate partner and Flybe client partner Simon Masters. 
 A team from Cleary, consisting of corporate partners Sam Bagot and James Modrall, along with competition 
partner Nicholas Levy, is advising Ryanair. 
 As part of the deal, Ryanair will transfer to Flybe Ireland 43 of Aer Lingus' European routes, a minimum of nine 
Airbus A320 aircraft and sufficient flight crew and support staff to maintain the routes. 
 In addition, Ryanair will capitalise the new business with a  100m (£85m) cash injection as well as all forward sales 
and cash liabilities estimated at a further  50m (£43m) to assist Flybe Ireland in establishing itself as a competitor in 
Ireland. 
 Masters said: "Flybe is one of Eversheds' most valued clients, which we have advised for many years. This is the 
latest in a series of recent deals we have done with Flybe and, if this proposal is implemented, it will greatly assist 
Flybe in expanding its European presence."
 In recent years, Eversheds has advised Flybe on its joint venture with Finnair to acquire Finnish Commuter 
Airlines, its listing on the London Stock Exchange and its acquisition of low-cost regional service BA Connect from 
British Airways.

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (14 Feb) announced 
the purchase of a new office building in Airside Business Park in Swords, Co Dublin, which will become Ryanair's 
new Dublin office. The 100,000 sq ft building will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations, including its commercial, 
customer service, finance, IT, legal and marketing departments.
 Ryanair will shortly begin the tendering process for the fit-out of the building and plans to move all of its Irish office 
operations and approximately 400 staff from its current offices at Dublin Airport to Airside before the end of 2013. 
Ryanair will also be offering up to half (50,000 sq ft) of this building for rent to other high profile multi-national 
companies who are looking for high spec offices in a great location, with ready access to Dublin Airport. Ryanair will 
continue to maintain some facilities at Dublin Airport for its pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: 'Ryanair is pleased to confirm the purchase of a new Dublin office building at Airside 
Business Park, Swords, Co Dublin. This brand new 100,000 sq ft state-of-the-art building will house all of Ryanair's 
Irish operations and some 400 staff will be based there when we complete our move before the end of 2013. This is 
a significant investment by Ryanair, allowing us the space and facilities to further develop our Dublin organisation, 
at much lower costs than the high rents on the Dublin Airport campus and allowing other staff currently housed in 
satellite offices to be brought together under one roof, resulting in a large reduction in rental expenses and further 
cost savings. Ryanair's Airside Business Park relocation will also provide a welcome economic boost for the 
growing town of Swords, which continues to attract blue-chip corporations - including the world's largest airline.'

 Taking a page out of the old Ryanair[1] playbook, Thai carrier Nok Airlines has paraded scantily-clad Maxim 
models in front of airplanes to promote its flights within Thailand.   The airline created a 2013 calendar and has 
posted the images to its Facebook[2] page. 
The airline's CEO, Patee Sarasin, told Thai media that the women in the photos were not Nok air staff[3] -- a key 
distinction from Ryanair's work -- saying: "It was supposed to be a gift to our customers, and so far the campaign 
has received positive feedback, increasing the number of passengers. There were so many viewers that the 
webpage crashed," ABC News reports.   Yet the Thai Ministry of Culture isn't so happy about it, telling ABC News 
that the "campaign focuses on the country's bad reputation regarding sex services[4], and an image that other 
organizations have been trying to change."  Sarasin defended the photos, in which the models are wearing bikinis 
in the airline's signature color of yellow. 'The airline business has always been seen as sexy globally[5]," he tells 
CNN. "That is why our planes -- we believe they are well designed -- appropriately become the background of these 
models. ... Most customers love the calendar and definitely want to own one. As of today, the calendar is becoming 
a hard-to-find commodity, and the requests for copies keep coming from all walks of life."  And he does have a 
point. Ryanair has raised hundreds of thousands of euros for charity thanks to its annual calendar[6], which features 
its flight attendants in skimpy bikinis and not much else. Virgin Atlantic flight attendants were named the "hottest in 
the sky"[7] back in 2011 thanks to a business travel site. And Aeroflot reportedly created a calendar of buck-naked 
flight attendants to give to its VIP fliers in 2010[8].   What do you think? Do you think sexiness -- overt or otherwise -
- has any place in the very friendly skies? Leave it in comments.

Ryanair | Published in: European News[1]Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, was notified this morning (12 Feb) at a 
State of Play meeting with the EU Commission, that the EU Commission intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer 
Lingus, despite the fact that Ryanair has met every competition concern raised in the EU's Statement of Objections 
and during the review process, including providing the EU - at its request - with irrevocable commitments from not 
one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus. 
IAG has committed that they would take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' entire London-Gatwick 
operations, and Flybe has committed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes. Given that the EU 
Commission recently approved IAG's acquisition of BMI at London-Heathrow on the basis of three year 
commitments, the EU's claim that it could not be satisfied of IAG's and Flybe's commitments to these Irish routes 
after three years is another example of the EU holding Ryanair to a much higher standard than any other EU airline. 
Ryanair's remedies package is unprecedented. For the first time in EU airline history, Ryanair delivered not one, but 
two, substantial upfront EU airline buyers who have agreed to come to Ireland to compete against a combined 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus. Ryanair has today instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition decision to the European 
Courts. Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: 'It appears clear from this morning's meeting, that no matter what remedies 
Ryanair offered, we were not going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition 
rules. Given Ryanair's remedies package clearly addresses every issue raised in the EU's Statement of Objections, 
any decision to prohibit would be manifestly unfair and in contravention of EU competition rules. Ryanair has no 
alternative but to appeal any prohibition decision and we expect to get a fair hearing at the European Courts, as we 
haven't received one from Commissioner Almunia and his case team. This decision is clearly a political one to meet 
the narrow, vested interests of the Irish Government and is not based on competition law.'

 One of the biggest low-cost airlines in Europe, Irish-backed Ryanair is still considering the possibility of entering the 
Georgian market, Trend news agency reported.
 As Georgian media outlets reported on Monday, Deputy Chief Executive of the company Michael Cawley said at a 
conference in London that Ryanair considers Georgia and Israel as potential markets.
 Cawley also said the reasons are that Georgia is attractive to the company.
 'This is a country with very liberal economy and Hungarian Wizz Air already flies there,' he said.
 The low-cost airline's entry into the market of the country was at the initiative of the Georgian president. However, it 
was failed to materialise.

Airlines urge scrapping of controversial air passenger duty

 LONDON: A new report has said that scrapping the controversial Air Passenger Duty (APD) could generate 60,000 
jobs by 2020.
 The report commissioned by four airlines, British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, is also expected to 
boost gross domestic product (GDP) by almost one per cent.
 The APD, instituted in 1994, is a British environmental tax aimed at offsetting aviation's carbon footprint. In its initial 
stage, it was set at £5 (US$7.85) per person.
 Regional governments have been lobbying London to remove the tax, which they said negatively affects the growth 
of the tourism industry since the Caribbean has been placed in a band that makes travel to the region much more 
expensive than travelling from London to the United States.
 Last year, St. Lucia Prime Minister and former Caribbean Community (CARICOM) chairman Dr Kenny Anthony 
expressed disappointment that the United Kingdom had 'opted to retain its discriminatory approach'
 Anthony said then that he had received a response from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne 
British government official which he described as 'interesting in one respect.
 'The Chancellor more or less confirms that the APD was introduced primarily to raise revenue to tackle the deficit in 
the United Kingdom,' Anthony said.
 The airlines that use the London route argue the APD acts as a major barrier to both tourism and potential 
investment in Britain.
 The UK is currently ranked 134th out of 138 countries by the World Economic Forum in terms of competitive 
aviation taxes and airport charges, ahead of only Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali and Chad.
 The study by the four major airlines estimates the economy would be £16 billion better off by 2015 were APD to be 
scrapped.
 Withdrawal of the tax would deliver an immediate increase of as much as 40 per cent in the number of foreign 
visitors to Britain, the study estimates, noting it would also encourage airlines to invest in new aircraft and develop 
routes to high-growth regions.
 Last year, the four airlines had urged Osborne to suspend the planned APD pending the outcome of the 
independent study of the economic effects of such a tax rise.
 The airlines said that the eight per cent increase introduced in April would reduce passenger numbers and hinder 
the UK's economic recovery.

 UK airport parking price comparison website 1stairportparking.co.uk has launched the monthly update of its 35 
most popular pages this week.
Harrow, England -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 02/06/2013 -- UK airport parking price comparison website            
http://www.1stairportparking.co.uk/http://           www.1stairportparking.co.uk[2] has launched the monthly update of 
its 35 most popular pages this week. The research this requires has revealed that car parking prices are already 
beginning to rise at most UK airports, six months before the summer holiday peak months.
 January is traditionally one of the busiest months of the year for booking flights and holidays. It also often sees the 
start of price movements on airport parking, and the main movement is up. UK airport parking price comparison 
website 1stairportparking.co.uk is recommending that people who have booked flights or holidays in January should 
also consider booking airport parking, to lock in current prices before the cheapest and most popular options are 
sold out and other prices rise.
 Pricing expert Lynn Bradshaw said; "A number of airlines including Ryanair and easyJet enjoyed new record 
passenger numbers in 2012, and holiday company Tui announced record profits. This has carried over in to 2013 
and airlines and holiday and have already seen record visits to their websites and bookings in January, as we look 
forward to getting away from the rain and the snow. Our advice for those who have already booked a flight or 
holiday is to start thinking about their airport car parking too."
 "The cost of parking at most UK airports rises the closer the booking date is to the date of travel, just as it does for 
last minute flights, hotels and many other travel items. This is especially the case for cheaper or popular car parks, 
and for meet and greet parking. So, for example, at almost every UK airport the cheapest parking for a stay in 
February 2013 was more expensive when booked in January than it would have been if booked in December."
 "Comparing prices for parking for the next three months - which includes the busy school half term and Easter 
periods - between January and February 2013 it is clear that prices for a number of parking options are already 
increasing at UK airports, including at Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted. We only saw the cheapest prices for key 
stay periods and dates unchanged at two airports - Belfast International and Prestwick. At every other major UK 
airport they are already on the move, and the main move is up."
 "At the moment prices are still close to their winter low, and for the next three months on a month by month basis 
the prices are either the same or similar. However, this will begin to change in the coming months, with the price for 
parking amp;aposthis monthamp;apos rising further and those for the busier spring and summer months rising even 
more. So now really is the ideal time to compare prices and lock in parking at a great price."

 Scrapping the controversial tax[1], which applies to all passengers flying from a UK airport, would deliver a 0.45pc 
boost to GDP within 12 months and could generate 60,000 jobs by 2020, according to a report commissioned by 
British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic.
 APD adds £13 to the cost of a short-haul flight, up from £5 in 2007, and as much as £92 in the case of long-haul. 
Airlines argue it acts as a major barrier to both tourism and potential investment in Britain. 
 It is rather too high though. London Lisbon return (one of the longer shorthaul flights around) is about 0.4 tonnes 
CO2. At Stern's $80 a tonne that's £20 odd. Rather than the £26 being charged. The overpayment is too high, 
obviously, for shorter flights.

British Airways | Published in: International News[1] A study commissioned by the UK's four major airlines on the 
economic impact of Air Passenger Duty shows that its abolition could bring a lasting boost to the UK economy, 
generating a net tax gain for the Treasury and creating almost 60,000 new jobs.
The study by PwC, The economic impact of Air Passenger Duty, used a model to simulate how changes in one 
area of the economy (such as tax policy) affects all the rest. This 'dynamic' approach to modelling tax impacts is 
used by the IMF, World Bank and some national governments, and has been advocated by Chancellor George 
Osborne.
 Applied for the first time to APD, the modelling finds that:
Abolishing APD could boost UK GDP by 0.46 per cent in the first year, with continuing benefits to 2020. The GDP 
boost to the UK economy would amount to at least £16 billion in the first three years and result in almost 60,000 
extra jobs in the UK over the longer term. Abolishing APD would pay for itself by increasing revenues from other 
sources such as income tax and VAT. This net benefit, even after allowing for the loss of APD revenue, would be 
almost £500m in the first year.
The modelling suggests this boost to GDP would come from three main sources:
Extra investment by airlines to expand their networks, and investment by other aviation businesses to support this 
growth; A net increase in inbound tourism, which constitutes an export for the UK economy; Over the medium term, 
higher business productivity resulting from increased business travel, which improves international business 
connections and creates employment.

 Using cautious assumptions, PwC's analysis shows that receipts from other taxes would rise as a result of APD's 
abolition, primarily because of business growth, leading to a net revenue gain for the Government of about £500m 
in each of the first two years and averaging £250m annually over the period to 2020.
 Fiscal Impact of APD abolition, £billions - Source: PwC
 The study describes APD as a 'substantial business cost', equating to about £500m a year for UK businesses 
overall. It adds: 'Abolishing APD has the potential to reduce the cost of flying, making it cheaper for businesses to 
maintain relationships with overseas customers. In this sense APD could be regarded as a tax on exports.'
Scrapping Flight Tax Could Pay For Itself And Create 60,000 Jobs, Says Pioneer Study
 The report ranks major UK taxes by how much additional GDP results from a £1 cut in tax revenue - a good guide 
to how much individual taxes can distort production decisions leading to inefficiencies in business decision making.
 How much extra GDP results from a £1 tax cut (median value over 30 years) - Source: PwC
 Comparing the impact of a variety of taxes, the analysis goes on: 'APD is at least as damaging to the UK economy, 
and probably more so, than corporation tax or fuel duty.' It ranks major UK taxes by how much additional GDP 
results from a £1 cut in tax revenue - a good guide to how much individual taxes distort business decisions and 
consumer behaviour.
 In recent Budgets, action has been taken to stem rises in fuel Duty and reduce corporation tax, while APD has 
risen continually. Since January 2007, APD has increased by up to 260 per cent for short-haul flights and up to 360 
per cent for long-haul. 
 The study further indicates that APD is regressive. For families in the bottom income decile, the APD cost for a 
family of four travelling to a European destination is some 28 per cent of weekly household expenditure. About 45 
per cent of APD-liable leisure trips in 2010 were made by passengers with below-average household income.
 See attached report:
 APD Short Version Final[2]
 1. The study, The economic impact of Air Passenger Duty, was commissioned by British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair 
and Virgin Atlantic, and is the first to be based on a net dynamic analysis of APD's impact, using a model that 
simulates how changes in one area of the economy (such as tax policy) affects all the rest. 
 2. Assumptions in the study about the size of consumer and business responses to changes in ticket costs reflect 
the average of a range of academic, governmental and industry estimates. The study's assumed productivity gains 
from increased business air travel, which suggests that every 10 per cent increase in business air travel translates 
to a 0.2 per cent increase in productivity, is at the lower end of the range suggested by other studies. 
 3. The study examined comparative aviation taxes worldwide, benchmarking APD against the various air 
passenger taxes levied in the UK's main comparator countries (and against a wider range of countries). In the view 
of the airlines which commissioned the report, other European countries are not exposed to such high aviation 
taxes, airlines operating primarily from these countries pay a much smaller amount of tax as a proportion of their 
turnover than UK airlines do. This means UK airlines are at a clear disadvantage in making new routes relative to 
their European and international competitors. 
 4. Since January 2007, APD has increased by up to 260 per cent for short haul flights (from £5 to £13) and up to 
360per cent for long haul flights (from £20 to £65 to destinations in the US, £81 to the Caribbean and £92 to 
Australia). These are economy-class rates. APD is double in premium cabins. The tax is charged on all passengers 
starting their journey in the UK. The Treasury expects to raise £2.9bn from APD this year, and plans future rate 
increases, taking revenue to £3.9bn by 2016/17. 
 5. The impact of APD is doubly felt by customers on return domestic UK flights, as they pay APD on each leg of the 
journey. The combined tax of £26 is frequently a substantial proportion of the total fare.
 6. George Osborne voiced his support for dynamic modelling to MPs on March 27, 2012: 'I think the Treasury can, 
and I have asked for this to happen, start undertaking some real research into dynamic scoring and what the 
broader-economy effects are of changes to taxation.'
 7. In 2009 the Netherlands followed Belgium by abandoning its equivalent of APD because, although the tax raised 
about £270m in one year, the loss to the wider economy from the tax was calculated to be more than £950m.

 Recently, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL[1]), the largest airline in Latin America, announced its tie-up 
with Localiza Rent a Car, a South American car rental company.
 Per the agreement, customers will be able to book a car on rent in GOL's website while purchasing an air travel 
ticket. This step is taken by the company to make travel easier, hassle free and economical for its customers. The 
service starts today, Feb 4, making it possible to rent a car simultaneously with buying an air ticket.
 The customers will benefit from the tie-up, as they will be able to obtain a discount of 20% on the daily rental rates 
for the car. The passengers are also offered a range of cars classified under group A, economic, to Group C, 
economic with air conditioning and hydraulic steering to choose from. However, these discounts and upgrades can 
only be availed of if the car is booked through Gol's website.
 Around 2 weeks ago, Gol announced strong air traffic update for Dec 2012, with increased passenger revenue per 
available seat kilometer (PRASK) of 14%, year over year. This tie-up is expected to increase the turn over of 
passengers, starting Feb 2013 and strengthen the PRASK further.
 Gol has its operations in 10 countries through 65 airports, while Localiza has a fleet of over 107 thousand cars in 8 
countries. Through the partnership the services will be delivered in 51 domestic airports.
 Gol currently bears a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks which are worth considering in the industry are Ryanair 
Holdings Plc. (RYAAY[2]), holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[3]) and 
China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. (CEA[4]); each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

            http://stuartsmithsblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/michael-oleary.jpegI was amused to read[1] that the 
incoming head of comms at Ryanair (forgive the oxymoron) has 'deliberately' ruled out a social media strategy.
 New boy Robin Kiely tells us - apparently without irony - that such an initiative 'would not be helpful' to Ryanair as 
'we would have so many people looking for a response.' A dedicated Facebook account, for instance, would 
probably mean 'hiring two more people to sit on Facebook all day.'
 Just two, Robin? Surely a legion would not be enough to handle the sycophantic email that would inundate your 
site.
 As an after-thought, Kiely mentions that customers of Ryanair are, in any case, handsomely provided for by the 
budget airline's 'customer care line'. Has anyone ever managed to find a living being on the other end of this, 
without being connected to the ether for half an hour beforehand? Just checking.
 Social media is, as you can imagine, heavily populated with accounts trading on the Ryanair brand, few of them 
complimentary. A quick trawl revealed an official PR Twitter account which has been dormant since August. By 
contrast, one altogether busier account, on Facebook, is that of the RyanairPilotGroup[2]. It's replete with 
commentary on Ryanair's alleged infractions of European working regulations; tax evasion; and imminent strike 
action.
 A bit worrying really, if these people really are Ryanair pilots 
 You know what they say, Robin: journalists, like Nature, abhor a vacuum. If you're not there, you're not a player.

 The European Union's top court has ruled that low-budget carrier Ryanair of Ireland has to pay more compensation 
to passengers stranded during the 2012 volcano eruption in Iceland. It had so far refused many claims. The 
European Court of Justice on Thursday ruled that Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair must compensate more passengers 
who couldn't reach their destinations on schedule because of the 2010 eruption of an Icelandic volcano spewing a 
massive cloud of ash for several days and crippling aviation.
 The Luxembourg court said even in such extraordinary circumstances airlines had the obligation to lodge and feed 
passengers before they could finish their journeys.
 Ryanair said it had already paid out over 26 million euros ($35.3 million) in compensation, but the carrier had 
refused many claims citing excessive costs. The court ruled on a case brought by an Irish citizen who experienced 
a five-day wait before flights between Ireland and the rest of the continent were re-established. She had claimed 
expenses to the tune of over 1,300 euros for her overnight stays and food which Ryanair must now ordered to pay.
 Change of pricing policies?
 The court also said there must be no time limit on claims for such compensation. It argued that the volcanic 
eruption definitely constituted extraordinary circumstances, but added there was no category of "particularly 
extraordinary" incidents that would allow carriers to be exonerated from their obligations.
 The judges said they realized the ruling might have dire consequences for some airlines' budgets, but added that 
passenger rights came first and indicated that carriers ought to make provisions for such otherwise unforeseeable 
disasters.
 Analysts commented the ruling was bound to impact air travel ticket prices particularly in the low-budget market.

 New York, January 28th (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[1]) ended the 
trading 
session higher by $0.6 or 1.56% from its previous close. Ryanair's price action formed what is considered to be a 
bullish engulfing candle that could very well signal a continuation of trend or reversal of the ongoing weakness.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[2]) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's recent stock range was formed by a trough where calculated support was defined at $33.96 and by a 
peak that established the resistance level at $38.99. This range could be used by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the bullish 
engulfing pattern to their advantage. The pattern provides a defined risk, as it shows where the bears were able to 
push the stock down, before the bulls step in with a bid.
The bullish engulfing pattern is a leading indicator that provides an alert to the bulls that the trend will continue or 
that there is an immediate reversal to the short-term weakness seen on the stock. Below an Engulfing Bullish

Ryanair shrugs off rising fuel prices to increase full year profits

 No-frills airline Ryanair has shrugged off rising fuel costs to increase its profit forecast for the full year after a better-
than-expected performance in the last three months of 2012.
More than 17m passengers travelled with Ryanair in the three months to the end of December and the average fare 
rose by 8pc.
"The 8pc rise in average fares reflects our improved customer service, record punctuality and the successful roll out 
of our reserved seating service," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive.
Despite an 81m euro rise increase in fuel costs, the airline was able to report an 18.1m euro ($24.3m; £15.4m) 
profit after tax in the three months to December, the third quarter of its financial year, up 21% on a year ago.
Ryanair was boosted by strong pre-Christmas bookings and lower operating costs, and now expects annual profits 
of close to 540m euros. Its previous guidance was for profits of 490-520m euros.
Last week, rival Easyjet said its losses for the first half of the year would be much lower than in 2011, as it reported 
a 9% rise in revenues.
Ryanair expects - as previously indicated - that traffic will drop by around 400,000 passengers in the final quarter 
due to the grounding of up to 80 aircraft, limiting the impact of high oil prices and seasonally weaker demand.
Nonetheless, it expects full-year profits to exceed its previous guidance and rise close to  540m.

 Popular culture is, as ever, a step behind the real world. Why hasn't anyone gone to jail for the financial crisis[1], 
Frontline asked on Tuesday. Maybe it's because, with markets now at their highest since 2007, all those awful 
memories are fading fast. Rip Van Winkle - assuming he avoided sleeping on a Select Comfort (SCSS), after the 
mattress maker slumped 16.6% last week - would wake up to find the idyllic equity market of half a decade ago. 
Contrarians note ominously, however, that two of the three nightly TV newscasts began their broadcasts on Friday 
with the return of retail investors to the market, a meme which the print media is also now running amok with[2].
 Still, when even Greece - up 3.97% to best all European bourses - appears to be on the mend, optimism abounds. 
Now if only we could do something about Apple (AAPL), fresh from its 12% tumble. This morning in economics, 
consensus calls for December pending home sales to tick up at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.
 In earnings action, it's the start of another frenetic week for fourth quarter announcements, with today's releases 
due to include Biogen Idec (BIIB), BMC Software (BMC), Caterpillar (CAT), MicroStrategy (MSTR), Ryanair 
(PINKY: RYAAY), Seagate Technology (STX), Steel Dynamics (STLD), VMware (VMW), Yahoo (YHOO), and Zions 
Bancorporation (ZION).
ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (ACAD): The stock is assigned an Outperform at Cowen.
Akorn, Inc. (AKRX) RBC Capital resumes Sector Perform rated research, and a $14 price objective, on AKRX.
DaVita (DVA): Shares are begun with a Market Perform by Sanford Bernstein.
Heineken (PINK:HINKY[3]): The Dutch brewing giant gets initiated at an Outperform by Sanford Bernstein.
Legacy Reserves (LGCY): The limited partnership is launched with a Buy at Ladenburg, whose target price is $30.
LipoScience (LPDX): The company is covered at Buy with WBB Securities.
PBF Energy (PBF): PBF is picked up with a Buy and $40 objective at Dahlman Rose, which says its Northeast 
product footprint mitigates an element of oversupply risk.

 My crystal ball is somewhat cloudy, and only fools are certain, but here is my best guest as to what new 
developments airline travelers are likely to see this year.
Carry on bag fees.
A major airline will start charging for carry on bags. United maybe? Spirit and Allegiant already do and they haven't 
gone out of business. In fact, they're expanding. Major carriers are watching carefully. If fewer people carry bags on 
board, planes can load and unload quicker, and spend more time in the air. Plus, it will add more fee revenue to the 
bottom line.
But, more places to put those carry ons.
Several airlines, such as American, are expanding carry-on storage on their older jets, or retiring them entirely with 
planes offering much larger bins, and about time. The bins in some of those older jets were designed 30 years ago. 
Fewer regional jets.
Speaking of small overhead bins, nobody really likes those 50-seat jets (RJs in airline speak). Airlines don't like 
them either, anymore, since they tend to be gas guzzlers. We'll see more of them retired to the Mohave Desert this 
year. 
More mergers, resulting in...
I'd be shocked if the American-US Airways merger doesn't happen this year. Will someone also gobble up Frontier 
Airlines? Alaska? It's possible. Which will lead to...
Higher fares.
Not way higher, just a bit higher, thanks to all those mergers and capacity cuts. Routes that both AA and USAir fly 
nonstop (Dallas-Charlotte, for instance) will see the brunt of fare increases. But most air travel is still "discretionary"-
-people can choose to stay home, drive, or tele-conference. And yet, airlines are getting smarter. They have figured 
out that chasing market share for market share's sake alone is a one-way trip to bankruptcy court. For example, in 
December JetBlue increased capacity by 6.1%. And flew exactly 6.1% more passengers. At 2% more revenue. And 
so...
Airlines will be profitable, even with...
With the possible exception of Virgin America. Even though they'll be flying with...
Fewer passengers.
As a result of the fees, the higher fares, and airport/TSA hassles, more people will take to the highways and rails. 
Or just take a cruise from a nearby port.
Except maybe for non-U.S. airlines
Changes Coming To An Airplane Near Your
They have newer planes. And newer flight attendants. And Emirates, Turkish, and other well-heeled airlines based 
outside North America will expand service from major U.S. airports. In April, Turkish will launch service from 
Houston, and has been slashing fares from there to everywhere it flies ($399 round-trip including tax to Istanbul? 
Take that, United). The airline plans to add flights from Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Miami and Orlando. Qatar Airways 
will add flights from Chicago in April, and plans to add Boston and Detroit. Ethiad will add service from Washington 
this year. These "superconnector" Middle Eastern airlines may provide some stiff competition to the American, 
Delta and United on international routes.
More regulations.
We'll see the U.S. Department of Transportation promulgate more consumer protections. One I'd like to see: no 
more bait and switch. If you book a nonstop flight then airlines can't put you on a connecting flight, assuming that 
the nonstop you booked still operates. Another: bring back Rule 240. If an airline cancels your flight or its severely 
delayed, you get to fly on a competitor's flight if that flight gets you to your destination quicker.
More self-service.
You already pay a fee to book an airline ticket by phone with an airline employee, but I think we'll see more 
incentives for self-service this year. Maybe a charge to interact with a ticket agent at the airport? Spirit and Ryanair 
already charge a fee if you don't print out your boarding pass before arriving at the terminal. We may see other 
airlines follow suit. You'll be encouraged to print out your own baggage tag, too; maybe pay your bag fee at home, 
put it on a scale for a quick weight check by an employee, tag it, place it on a conveyor belt. And then you'll scan 
your boarding pass at the Jetway entrance. 
Less legroom. But...
Airlines will continue to cram more seats into their planes, reducing legroom. However...
More premium economy.
Airlines have finally squeezed you so hard in those uncomfortable seats that you're now willing, or so they think, to 
pay more for slightly more comfort. JetBlue, American, Delta, United and American will all sell more "Main Cabin 
Extra," "Premium Economy," "Economy Comfort," or similar products for upcharges of between $10 and $118 per 
flight segment. Not more width, but definitely more (4 inches or so) legroom. And many foreign airlines (British, Air 
France, Lufthansa, Cathay, etc.) will offer this sort of thing too, along with perks such as preferred boarding. 
Basically all you're getting is what you used to get for free, before the airlines put the squeeze on. 
And more bundled fares.
American kicked it off with $68 and $88 fare add ons (not fees, fares), including a round-trip checked bag, no 
change fees, priority boarding, and an adult beverage. Delta quickly followed suit with a more tentative set of 
bundled perks. Others will follow. Just as with premium economy, it's back to the future.

 The SP 500 Index (^GSPC) continued its recent run and has now gained for eight straight sessions, something that 
last occurred in early November 2004. Spain, home of the matador, tried typically hard to kill the bull[1], but Wall 
Street's animal spirits simply couldn't be stopped.
 This was largely due to two hedge fund magnates who absolutely repel each other, one of whom is an especially 
big believer in a word with deep roots in America's rich agricultural and farming tradition[2]. (Clearly it can't be 
coincidental that fertilizer firm Agrium (AGU) finished Friday at an all-time high, fresh from Mr. Icahn's endorsement 
of its principal product?) 3M Co. (MMM), whose iconic adhesive tape was so-named to please the company's 
"cheap Scotch bosses," added on 1.9% to also end at an historic best, its stock on fire just in time for Burns Night[3] 
in Edinburgh.
 The 2013 Davos confab concluded, with Bill Gates' prediction at its 2004 edition that spam would be history[4] 
within two years looking as pie-in-the-sky as ever. Still, since Microsoft (MSFT) stock rose 2.3% over four holiday-
shortened sessions, the billionaire can afford to be smug at Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL[5]) expense, what with it 
having now imploded 17% so far this year.
 This morning in economics, consensus calls for December pending home sales to tick up at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.
 In earnings action, it's the start of another frenetic week for fourth quarter announcements, with today's releases 
due to include Biogen Idec (BIIB), BMC Software (BMC), Caterpillar (CAT), MicroStrategy (MSTR), Ryanair 
(PINKY:RYAAY[6]), Seagate Technology (STX), Steel Dynamics (STLD), VMware (VMW),Yahoo (YHOO), and 
Zions Bancorporation (ZION).
AK Steel (AKS): Shares get slashed to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): New week, same old story for the troubled tech stock, which finished Friday at a fresh 
52-week trough. Today it is taken to Neutral from Outperform at Baird Equity Research. "We believe the shares 
could drop further, despite the sharp sell-off and valuation," analysts wrote in a note. The price objective, previously 
$570, is now $465.
Bed Bath Beyond (BBBY): Goldman Sachs gives BBBY a Sell-from-Neutral downgrade.
Brookfield Properties (BPO): The Real Estate Investment Trust is reduced to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup.
Corning (GLW): The glass-maker gets cut to Equal Weight from Overweight by Barclays.
Energizer (ENR): Morgan Stanley moves the stock to Equal-Weight from Overweight.
Ford Motor (F): The car company is cut to Underperform from Neutral at Buckingham Research.
Joy Global (JOY): The maker of earth moving equipment is itself moved to Market Perform from Outperform at

Hancock Holding (HBHC): Credit Suisse cuts the company to Underperform from Neutral amid lower than expected 
margins and earnings.
Navios Maritime Partners (NMM): The equity is now Hold from Buy at Deutsche Bank.

 The Dow (^DJI) is now up 6% so far this year, and on course for its best January since 1989, an unimaginably 
distant age almost a quarter-century ago. Back then Japan, fresh from scooping up Rockefeller Center on the 
cheap, was seeing a stock surge[1], with Sony (SNE) especially ascendant[2], while Toyota (TM) was taking Detroit 
to the cleaners[3].
 On this side of the Atlantic, a tech icon which was also big in the '80s fell on hard times. But enough about Atari[4]. 
All of a sudden it is Apple (AAPL), down 37.3% from September peaks, that we have to worry about. No such 
troubles for Procter Gamble (PG), which surged 4.7% amid strong sales of its razor blades Braun, Fusion, Gillette, 
and Mach 3. Although apparently the bearded hipster head honcho of Goldman Sachs[5] (GS) remains to be 
convinced.
 This morning in economics, consensus calls for December pending home sales to tick up at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. In 
earnings action, it's the start of another frenetic week for fourth quarter announcements, with today's releases due 
to include Biogen Idec (BIIB), BMC Software (BMC), Caterpillar (CAT), MicroStrategy (MSTR), Ryanair 
(PINKY:RYAAY[6]), Seagate Technology (STX), Steel Dynamics (STLD), VMware (VMW), Yahoo (YHOO), Zions 
Bancorporation (ZION).
ASML Holding (ASML): Shares in the semiconductor-equipment supplier are up at an 18 year high in today's 
European trading after a Buy-from-Neutral boost at Citigroup.
Best Buy (BBY): BBY is boosted to Buy from Hold at BBT Capital.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG): Lazard lifts the fast food firm to Buy from Neutral.
Facebook (FB): Raymond James raises its rating on the social network, fresh from last week's 6.3% surge, to 
Outperform from Market Perform, sending the stock up in today's pre-market activity.
Halliburton (HAL): The oil services outfit gets hoisted to Buy from Hold at MLV Co, which takes its target price to 
$52 from $36.
NetApp (NTAP): NTAP is now Overweight from Equal Weight at Barclays.
News Corp (NWSA): Rupert Murdoch's media empire is moved to Overweight from Equal-Weight at Morgan 
Stanley, which highlights an upcoming spin-off.
Norfolk Southern (NSC): Jefferies juices the railroad to Buy from Hold.
Procter Gamble (PG): The Dow (^DJI) member is upgraded to Buy from Neutral at B. Riley Caris, whose price 
objective is $88.
Stock Upgrades: Dust Off Those Walkmans -- Sony 's Suddenly Sexy Again
Sony (NYSE:SNE[7]): Shares, on a real run of late, are surging a further 6.94% before the bell on an upgrade to 
Buy from Neutral at Citigroup. The bank believes expected yen weakness should bring strategy changes aimed at 
improving earnings in consumer electronics.
Staples (SPLS): The office supply outfit is now Neutral from Sell at Goldman Sachs.
Starwood Hotels (HOT): Janney Capital Markets juices its recommendation to Buy from Neutral and increases its 
price objective to $67 from $55. "Another round of asset sales could begin and [the company] could move closer to 
its goal of being asset light," its analysts wrote in a note.
TNT Express (PINK:TNTEY[8]): The package delivery outfit is now Buy from Neutral at UBS, which says 
management will take aggressive action on its operations in both Brazil and China. As a result, the stock is sharply 
higher in London this morning.
Xerox (XRX): BMO Capital raises its rating to Outperform from Perform.

 THREE months ago the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld a ruling that airline passengers are entitled to 
compensation if their flight is significantly delayed. But getting airlines to pay is proving tricky. New research[1] by 
Flight-Delayed.co.uk, a fee-charging claims website, suggests airlines are becoming less co-operative while relying 
on increasingly inventive reasons for rejecting claims. Between July and December last year, the company found 
that only 8.5% of initial applications submitted by 10,412 passengers were honoured by airlines.
After years of legal wrangling, the ECJ ruling in October was unequivocal. Under regulation 261 carriers are legally 
obliged to pay out between  250-600 ($330-800) depending on the distance of the flight, provided the departure is 
delayed by at least three hours. They must also provide food, accommodation and access to a telephone. The 
regulation applies to flights within Europe, out of Europe and those bound for the continent if they are operated by a 
European airline. Carriers are unhappy. Ryanair charges  2 for what it calls an "EU 261 compensation levy".
The main vehicle through which airlines reject claims is a loosely defined get-out-clause for force majeure, or 
extraordinary circumstances. About four out of ten applications are turned down on the basis of unforeseeable 
"technical difficulties". Precise reasons, only divulged later in the compensation process, have included congested 
toilets and broken cockpit doors. Obfuscation is common. Some carriers litter their responses with legal jargon. 
Others use poorly worded complaint forms, which they are allowed to design themselves. But passengers can 
count themselves lucky if they get a response at all. Before the ruling, 45% of applications received a response 
within the prescribed six-week time limit. After the ruling, that figure fell to 24%. 
The report provides response rates and reasons for ten European carriers, including the three biggest airlines that 
operate from Britain. That is not a full data set by any means. But the numbers are striking nonetheless. The airline 
industry may soon have to explain why the procedures for handling valid compensation claims seem to reward only 
the most persistent of passengers.

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1] Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), today (23 Jan) announced 
that after considering over 75 applicants, it has appointed Robin Kiely as its new Head of Communications (from 1 
Feb) following an extensive recruitment process. 
 
A former journalist, Robin (31 - but looks 15) joined Ryanair in April 2012 as Communications Manager and 
succeeds Stephen McNamara (35 - but looks 45 thanks to Europe's media!), who joins the Irish Rugby Football 
Union after over four years at Ryanair. Ryanair will now recruit a new Communications Manager to replace Robin. 
Full details are available at            www.ryanair.com/en/careers/job[2] (closing date - 5pm 30 Jan).
 As part of its new communications platform, Ryanair is to launch a series of media relations initiatives over the 
coming months, including a dedicated media website.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara (pictured above right) said: 'Following an incredible response for the advertised 
vacancy, Ryanair is pleased to appoint Robin Kiely as our new Head of Communications. Robin has impressed 
from day one after joining the team in April 2012. Ryanair is well known for offering rapid promotions to those who 
are ambitious and professional in what they do and Robin's promotion to Head of Communications is well 
deserved. Robin can now kiss his family goodbye as he takes advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity.' 
Ryanair's Robin Kiely (pictured above left) said: 'I'm delighted to have been appointed Ryanair's Head of 
Communications and look forward to improving our communication with Europe's media. I am also looking forward 
to keeping our 80m passengers informed of the latest Ryanair news and developments as we continue to grow into 
2013 and beyond.'

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (18th Jan) explained that its 1 carry-on bag rule is necessary for safety 
reasons. Ryanair also rejected many of the false claims made by a number of poorly briefed MEP's in the European 
Parliament yesterday.
Because Ryanair operates with very high load factors (avg load factor last year was 83% or over 150 passengers 
per flight), and because Ryanair encourages its passengers to travel with free of charge carry-on bags in order to 
avoid checked in bag fees, most Ryanair passengers avail of Ryanair's (free of charge) 10kg carry-on bag 
policy. This means that on a regular basis, all of the overhead lockers and the storage space under the seats are 
fully used, and Ryanair cannot allow a second carry-on bag to be brought on board for passenger safety reasons. 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: 'The inaccurate claims made by some MEP's yesterday that Ryanair's free of 
charge carry-on bag policy was designed to 'generate revenues' were absurd and untrue. The purpose of Ryanair's 
free of charge 10kgs carry-on bag is to allow passengers to avoid our checked in bag fees. 75% of Ryanair's 80m 
passengers now travel without paying any checked in bag fees, while availing of our 10kg free of charge carry-on 
bag facility. This reduces Ryanair's revenues (and our costs). 'Ryanair's 1 carry-on bag rule cannot be changed for 
safety reasons. It would be helpful if these MEP's made some basic attempt to understand Ryanair's safety and low 
fare policies before making false and inaccurate claims in the European parliament. 'The idea that Europe's only 
ultra low fares airline, which has pioneered low fare travel and continues to promote free of charge carry-on bags 
(when other airlines are increasingly charging for carry-on bags) and lower prices than any other airline, is 
somehow an example of 'capitalist greed', is as absurd as some of these MEP's claiming to care about consumers, 
while travelling on high fare airlines at the taxpayers' expense. Ryanair's 1 bag rule is a safety rule, not a revenue 
rule.'

grow and develop to become a leading market in the Mediterranean region. This long-term commitment, as shown 
in the implementation of two bases in Fez and Marrakesh, and the opening of two new destinations (Essaouira and 
Rabat), is the first stage of a comprehensive strategy aiming, for Ryanair, to build a profitable business based on 
the huge growth potential of Moroccan tourism, as planned within the framework of Vision 2020. The Moroccan 
Ministry of tourism is convinced that an efficient growth strategy can only succeed if it takes into consideration the 
emergence of new tourism products, the need for an adequate air service as well as for an efficient marketing 
activity. Through MNTO, we will strengthen our marketing efforts in the main source markets at which Ryanair will 
increase its air services to Morocco.' * ACI research confirms up to 1,000 'on-site' jobs are sustained at international

 For some airlines, you can only bring along one item onto the flight, period. For others, you may be allowed to bring 
along another carry-on bag/suitcase - depending on the size of your handbag of course. How can you sort through 
the confusion when you're travelling, especially if you're changing airlines? Below are the handbag treatment 
allowances for a number of the world's most popular airlines.
American Airlines
You can carry one personal item along with a small carry-on bag. Your handbag can be used as your personal item, 
provided it does not exceed 36 inches total (length+width+height) and fits under the seat in front of you.
Air Canada
Air Canada allows passengers to bring aboard one standard article with maximum dimensions of 9 x 15.5 x 21.5 
inches including wheels and handles and weighing up to 22 lbs, along with a personal article such as a large 
handbag, with maximum dimensions of 6 x 13 x 17 inches and weighing up to 22 lbs. 
 Additionally, Air Canada allows passengers to bring other smaller items in addition to their carry-on allowance, 
including smaller purses under 10 x 12 x 5.5, which won't be counted as one of the 2 carry-on allowance items.
British Airways
British Airways allows passengers to take on board one piece of cabin baggage weighing a maximum of 51 lbs, 
along with a handbag. They also stipulate that you must be capable of placing the bag in the overhead locker 
yourself. The maximum dimensions of the primary hand luggage cannot exceed 22 x 18 x 10 inches, while the 
handbag cannot exceed 18 x 14 x 8, including the pockets and handles. It must also be fit below the seats.
Delta Airlines
Sorting Out The Confusion: Does Your Handbag Count As Carry-On Baggage?
Delta Airlines allows passengers to bring aboard one carry-on bag and one personal item such as a handbag. On 
flights with less than 50 seats, passengers can only bring a personal item (no carry-on), though carry-on items will 
be gate-checked free of charge. The maximum dimensions for carry-on baggage is 45 linear inches or 22 x 14 x 9.
EasyJet
You can carry on one piece of hand baggage in total. It must not exceed 22.4 x 18 x 10 inches including wheels, 
and must fit into the overhead bin. This includes hand bags.
 EasyJet's website also warns that on busy flights, they can't guarantee that all carry-on baggage will fit in the cabin, 
so they advise passengers with carry-on bags to arrive earlier in order to avoid having their bags put on hold.
Quantas
Quantas allows you to bring one piece (2 pieces for First/Business/Premium Economy) of carry-on luggage up to 15 
lbs, as well as an additional small personal item such as a handbag.
RyanAir 
RyanAir permits a single piece of cabin baggage per passenger. The item may have maximum dimensions of 22 x 
16 x 8 inches and a maximum weight of up to 26 lbs. Handbags must be used as the carry-on item or placed within 
it.
 RyanAir's website also cautions that oversized or extra carry-on baggage will be refused at the gate or placed in 
the hold of the aircraft for an additional fee of £50/ 50.
Southwest
Southwest passengers can bring aboard one carry-on bag along with one small personal item. Carry-on bags must 
be under 10 x 16 x 24 inches.
United Airlines
United Airlines passengers can bring aboard one carry-on bag, no larger than 45 linear inches or 14 x 9 x 22 
inches, as well as a personal item like handbags[1]. 
Virgin Atlantic
Virgin Atlantic allows you to bring aboard one piece of carry-on luggage not exceeding 9 x 14 x 22 inches, and two 
pieces for Upper Class passengers. You can also bring along your handbag as an additional item - provided you're 
using it as you normally would - meaning you're not stuffing your handbag as extra baggage space to bring on extra 
travel items.
If You're Unsure, Give The Airline A Call
In the modern travel environment, the rules and regulations are constantly being adjusted. Remember, the only way 
to be 100% sure that you're getting the most up-to-date and accurate information at check-in time is to give the 
airline a call beforehand. Also, specific regulations in local jurisdictions may create exceptions to the rules above, 
depending on local government regulations. In the U.S. for example, all airlines must allow disabled passengers to 
bring on additional mobility equipment, without counting it towards the carry-on baggage or personal item 
allowance.
Sorting Out The Confusion: Does Your Handbag Count As Carry-On Baggage?
 If you're uncertain about a rule or an allowance, give the check-in desk a call beforehand to ensure that you're 
complying with the regulations. Going over your allotted carry-on or baggage allowance can be costly and can delay 
your travel plans, so make sure you prepare ahead of time.

 'I was very surprised when I discovered that Lithuanians are at the 8th place according to the rate of unhappiness 
out of 150 countries. Lithuania is approximately in line with Afghan people. But Afghanistan suffering years of war 
which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, where people seem to be so unhappy are only one point lower 
than Lithuania. There are no objective reasons to feel unhappy in Lithuania. 
 But do you know what happiness is? Hidden unhappiness' said Vilnius University Professor Jonas Grigas. 'Looking 
objectively, I think that there is absolutely no reason to feel unhappy in Lithuania. Why people in Lithuania are not 
happy? Because they do not think positively, they have too much of negative thoughts. I think that in order to feel 
happy one has to think positively. () I assure you that, if not every day, at least every week something new is 
discovered. Have you ever read in any newspaper about new discoveries? Meanwhile, only Viln

 On Thursday, after a break the court resumed the Labour Party (DP) black bookkeeping case. From now on, 
hearings should be held every week until May, then the court promises to announce a verdict. However, according 
to Leader of the Labour Party Viktor Uspaskikh, the court process will not be long. 'There are no applications. If you 
see the DP has even changed its representative but this did not delay the trial. Another thing, basic applications that 
maybe necessary to the process itself or to the judges themselves because everything is so mixed. 
 It tires out, how much more is possible,' said Uspaskikh. As yesterday court was announcing case material it 
encountered unexpected obstacles. Lawyer representing the Labour Party Valdemaras Buzinskas said he was

production prices by an average of 6 percent. 'It does not mean that production price will increase by the same 
amount in shops. We do not influence retail pricing, traders will decide for themselves what will be the price of 
bread on shelves,' says Ambrukaitis.
 Manufacturers claim that they are increasing prices because of growing raw material and energy cost. 'We have 
already assumed a part of losses ourselves because raw material prices have increased since August. We wanted

 TRANSPORT
 Cheap flights and cheap accommodation in foreign resorts will start to compete with Irish airline company Ryanair. 
Travel tour agency Novaturas has presented new brand. This tour operator blew dust from the previously proposed 
tourism project with the same name. Now they detached it from more expensive proposals and created a separate 
low-cost travel brand. According to Eco Travel brand Manager Rytis Sumakario they will seek to coordinate 
aggressive Ryanair's pricing and travel operator's negotiating skills. Eco Travel deals will be targeted for those 
holidaymakers who think that the minimum is enough - flight, hotel accommodation and cabin baggage. So far Eco 
Travel offers tours to Turkey's Antalya region since mid-April. Eventually the new market player is going to offer 
trips to Greece and Spain. LIETUVOS RYTAS
 AGRICULTURE
 Since Lithuanian Government seemed to be powerlessness to negotiate humane conditions for our farmers they 
were forced to storm Brussels for themselves. Chairman of Chamber of Agriculture Andriejus Stancikas is sure that 
the battle for survival will continue this year. 
 Baltic farmers who were holding protest actions in November last year are waiting for good news, when the 
European Union (EU) will finally let them compete on the better terms in the market with farmers from other 
countries. Our farmers may expect more than EUR 50 per hectare compared to what they receive now. However, 
they can only hope. In order to actually receive larger payments Lithuanian negotiators and our president will have 
to use their best negotiation skills.
 Stancikas says that there are no arguments why Baltic country farmers are paid less. 'Every country has a certain 
weight, the smaller you are, the worse negotiating position you have,' says Stancikas. According to him, today 
Lithuanian farmers are offered EUR 144 per hectare. 'During Baltic farmers rally in Brussels in a meeting with our 
country's president, there were talks that Brussels position was changing, i.e. the farmers will be offered EUR 193 
per hectare. However, transitional period was set by 2020. Of course, we are not satisfied with this,' said Stancikas.

10 Candidates In Running For 'Worst Job In PR'
10 Candidates In Running For 'Worst Job In PR'

Jan 14, 2013 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Just 10 candidates remain for what has been dubbed 'the worst job in PR' - head of communications at Ryanair.
 The no-frills airline began advertising for the position last month, after it was announced that current incumbent 
Stephen McNamara would be taking up a similar role at the Irish Rugby Football Union.
 Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, paid tribute to Mr McNamara, who he said had been 'battered and 
bruised' for four years, and added that the hunt was on to find a 'brave soul' to take on the 'high profile and 
incredibly overpaid' challenge.
 Now, according to a report in the Irish Independent[1], the airline has reduced the field to 10 candidates after the 
latest round of interviews took place last week. It is also understood that the final selection of candidates will be 
interrogated by Mr O'Leary himself - a daunting task that will only be topped by the actual job of looking after 
Ryanair's public image.
 For a company that describes itself as 'the world's most popular airline', Ryanair's receives criticism on a frequent 
basis - largely due to its high fees and charges.
 To check in a bag on the Irish carrier, travelers must pay between £25 and £45, while all passengers are required 
to pay a £6 'admin' fee, a £6 'web check-in' fee, as well as a 'EU261 levy', to offset the cost of paying compensation 
for flight delays and cancellations, and an 'ETS levy' to cover the cost of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme.
 It also faced allegations about flight safety last year when two aircraft bound for Madrid were forced to make an 
emergency landing in Valencia after they drew near to their minimum level of fuel.
 Mr O'Leary's outspoken nature is unlikely to make life any easier for the new PR guru. Last year he described Suzy 
McLeod, a British woman who was charged £236 by the airline for failing to print out her own boarding pass, as 
'stupid'. Other memorable comments include his dismissal of customer service - 'People say the customer is always 
right, but you know what - they're not. Sometimes they are wrong and they need to be told so' - and his criticism of 
overweight passengers - 'Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat ****** on board. We have been frankly astonished 
at the number of customers who don't only want to tax fat people but torture them.'

 France air transport market - An unstable situation forced some service providers to exit the industry. As a result, 
the total number of companies declined by more than 3% since 2006 to 468 in 2012. The concentration in the 
industry is high as the top five companies accounted for over 60% of total turnover in 2010. The industry leader is 
Air France-KLM Group, comprising a substantial 55% share of the industry's turnover. Its distant competitors are 
Société Air France and Corsair. The French are also buying services from foreign companies, with Ryanair, British 
Airways and easyJet, among the most popular.
Air France-KLM Group was formed after the merger of Air France and Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (known 
as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines) in 2004. The group operates from two hubs: one in France and one in the 
Netherlands. It flies to nearly 300 destinations with a fleet consisting of 590 aircraft, of which 14 are full freighters. 
However, Air France-KLM shares have fallen 64% in 2011, buffeted by relatively high costs as the industry tackled 
rising fuel prices. Its woes contrast with 30-40% gains over 2011 for low-cost leaders easyJet and Ryanair. Air 
France-KLM slumped to a net loss of EUR809 million in 2011 down from a EUR289 million profit the year before.
The French air transportation market grew by 11% since 2006, reaching EUR15.6 billion in 2012. The market has 
been in an expansion phase throughout the review period, with a CAGR of 2% over 2006-2012.
Businesses have been the main buyers, accounting for 56% of total market value in 2012. Of all business-to-
business purchases, the air transport industry itself captured the largest market share (25%) in 2012. In addition, 
cargo handling, warehousing and travel agencies, as well as monetary intermediation buyers, accounted for 7% 
shares of the total market each. Households increased their expenditure on air transportation by 17% over the 
2006-2012 period to accounted for 44% of the total market in 2012.
The turnover of local service providers is expected to grow by around 5% per annum over the 2013-2018 period, 
with local turnover topping EUR26.7 billion in the latter year. However, air transportation will continue to be 
perceived less favourably in France as well as in the EU compared to water and rail transportation due to 
environmental and noise concerns. Low-cost airlines will continue dictating terms in the passenger transportation 
sector, forcing a decrease (or at least not an increase) in prices, as market growth will be driven by a growing 
number of low- and medium-income consumers.

 New Consumer Goods research report from Business Monitor International is now available from Fast Market 
Research
Boston, MA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 01/09/2013 -- The Morocco Tourism Report examines the long-term potential offered 
by the country but cautions that the economic crisis in the eurozone will continue to weigh on short-term inbound 
tourism demand. This means overall tourist arrivals and receipt growth rates could well slow over 2013.
 The report also analyses the growth and risk management strategies being employed by some of the leading 
players in the local tourism sector (ie: airlines and hotel chains) as they seek to maximise the long-term growth 
opportunities offered by the Moroccan market.
 In 2011, Morocco welcomed 9,342,302 tourists, an increase of 0.6% compared to 2010, according to information 
from the Ministry of Tourism. This was a disappointing outcome and reflected several factors: first, the economic 
crisis in the eurozone weighed on outbound tourism demand from the key source markets of France and Spain; 
second, the after-effects of the April 2011 suicide bomb attack on a popular tourist cafe in Marrakech, which killed 
16 people; and third, uncertainty ahead of the parliamentary election of November 2011 - a period marked by 
several demonstrations across the country.
View Full Report Details and Table of Contents[2]
 Although the election passed peacefully, BMI believes the other two negative factors (eurozone slowdown and 
lasting impact of Marrakech attack) will endure across 2012. Early indications are not encouraging, with arrivals for 
January-April reportedly down by 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 2.52mn, according to a report in the La Vie Eco 
newspaper in June. Passenger traffic at Moroccan airports was also down, by 4.73% y-o-y, over the January-
August. Given this poor start to the year, BMI forecasts that there will be a 5% decrease in tourist arrivals for 2012 
and a 7% fall in tourism revenue.
 Over the past year, BMI has revised the following forecasts and views:
 - BMI has become more negative on the outlook for Moroccan tourism, forecasting that growth rates for inbound 
tourism will slow to an average of 4.8% per annum across the new, extended forecast period to 2017, with risks to 
the downside if Europeaposs economy remains depressed.
 - BMI believes Ryanairaposs decision to stop 34 weekly flights to and from Morocco in October 2012 will have a 
negative impact on inbound tourism arrivals, though other low-cost carriers are reportedly looking to take over from 
Ryanair on some services.
Morocco Tourism Report 2013 - New Market Report Now Available
 - BMI is also concerned that the tourism sector is not being as strongly promoted as it has been in recent years by 
the authorities. This is reflected in the lack of up-to-date data available through official government channels on key 
variables such as tourism arrivals and national hotel room capacity.

Dec 31, 2012 (TradersHuddle.com:http://www.tradershuddle.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 New York, December 31st (TradersHuddle.com) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[1]) closed 
the trading
day lower by $0.33 or -0.96% from its previous close. Ryanair's price action formed what is considered to be a
doji close, where the open and close prices are very close to each other, mainly signaling an indecision between 
buyers and sellers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[2]) provides low fare passenger airline services to destinations in Europe.
Ryanair's trading range is defined by a trough, which marked calculated support at $32.49 and by a peak that set 
the 
resistance point at $36.20. These levels are closely watched by traders managing their positions.
Traders wanting to establish a position in Ryanair or traders that are already holding the stock can use the doji 
close to their advantage, since the pattern present a short-term pause in the stock's price action. This pause 
results in an entry point for traders depending of which way the stock resolves this short-term indecision.
The Doji is an important candlestick pattern that provides information on their own and as components in a number 
of important patterns. Doji form when a security's open and close are virtually equal. The length of the upper and 
lower shadows can vary and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross or plus sign. Alone, doji are 
neutral patterns.
Any bullish or bearish bias is based on preceding price action and future confirmation. In the case of Ryanair, given 
that the stock finished the session lower, bears should monitor the stock, as it could reverse if it manages to trade 
above its intraday high. Below a Doji illustration:

Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, has confirmed that Santa Claus was undertaking test flights after he 
was photographed by a passenger as he flew alongside a Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Oslo yesterday.
 
 The photo, which should thrill children worldwide, clearly shows Santa and his reindeer on their way back to the 
North Pole, following his final test flights before Christmas Eve.
To celebrate Christmas and this definitive proof that Santa Claus is ready to deliver presents worldwide , Ryanair 
will release 100,000 seats across its European network from midnight (24:00hrs) Mon, 24 Dec, at prices starting 
from just  8 for travel on Mon, Tue, Wed Thur in January. These #8216;all in#8217; low fares will be available on 
over 1,000 of Ryanair's European routes but must be booked on [2]www.ryanair.com before midnight (24:00hrs) 
Thur, 27 Dec.            http://www.ryanair.com/ Ryanair's  8 Seat Sale includes all taxes, charges and fees, so 
passengers who choose to avoid discretionary charges, travel with carry-on luggage only and decline our priority 
boarding service can book, check-in online and fly for this advertised  8 fare on these seat sale flights[3]. 
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 #8216;A Ryanair passenger managed to photograph Santa's sleigh from the window of one of our London-Oslo 
flights yesterday and just like our 1,500 daily departures, the photo has gone across Europe. Ryanair's fares are so 
low it's sometimes hard to believe they're real - but just like Santa Claus, they most definitely are. And remember, 
Ryanair's fares are low for life, not just for Christmas.
 To celebrate Christmas and the confirmation that Santa is ready for Christmas, from midnight on Monday (24 Dec), 
passengers can book 100,000 seats at prices starting from just  8 for travel across our European network in 
January. These seats can only be booked until midnight (24:00hrs) Thur (27Dec) and are sure to be snapped up 
fast so we urge passengers to book them on            www.ryanair.com before they sell out.#8217;[4]

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]
Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline, welcomed today's (20 Dec) publication by the CAA of its #8216;minded 
to#8217; assessment of Stansted's market power. The CAA is minded to rule that Stansted has market power, and 
accordingly must be subject to effective regulation to protect the reasonable interests of Stansted's users (airlines 
and passengers) from exploitation by the BAA Stansted monopoly.
 In particular Ryanair welcomes the CAA's finding that #8216;Stansted is pricing to its regulatory price cap and 
there is evidence to suggest that it is pricing above the competitive level#8217;. The CAA has commissioned an 
independent benchmarking study which shows that Stansted's prices are likely to be above the level of comparator 
airports.
 Ryanair believes that this finding vindicates the earlier ruling of the Competition Commission, that the CAA's 
#8216;inadequate#8217; regulatory regime has adversely effected competition and users at Stansted. Over the 
past five years from 2007 to 2011, the BAA Stansted monopoly has doubled its prices, while traffic has declined by 
25%. The BAA has repeatedly claimed that this traffic decline is due to #8216;low consumer confidence#8217; 
without explaining why Heathrow and Gatwick have returned to traffic growth. The ability to raise prices, even when 
other competitive airports are reducing them, is in Ryanair's view compelling evidence of BAA Stansted abusing its 
market power. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: #8216;We welcome today's finding by the CAA that Stansted 
has market power, and that evidence shows it is pricing #8216;above the level of comparator airports#8217;. This is 
why Stansted's traffic has declined in recent years, even as Gatwick, Heathrow and other UK airports have returned 
to growth. Ryanair welcomes the current forced sale of Stansted by the over-charging BAA monopoly, but it is clear 
that any new owner of Stansted will have to be subject to effective regulation, as opposed to the CAA's previous 
inadequate regulator regime. Effective regulation is the only way to ensure that the interests of Stansted users are 
protected, and Stansted is returned to a low cost, high growth future in the best interest of the airport itself, its airline 
customers and most of all its passengers. Ryanair welcomes today's findings by the CAA and hopes that it will lead 
to a much more effective regulatory regime in future where the new owners of Stansted Airport are forced to run an 
efficient facility and price its services at or below the level of comparator airports.#8217;

 The strongly resilient Polish construction sector is set for a significant slowdown, with BMI forecasting average 
annual growth of 3% over the next five years. We remain fairly optimistic about growth in the infrastructure sub-
sector - mostly helped by investments in the airports and roads, while remaining bearish about recovery in the 
residential and non-residential construction industry.
Our cautious outlook is a result of the ongoing gloom in the sector where a combination of unfavourable base 
effects, end of key projects and poor investor sentiments will make strong growth difficult to attain.
The construction sector growth fell from 9.6% y-o-y in Q1 2012, to only 1.4% in Q2. Additionally, a large number of 
planned projects are being delayed, altered or completely terminated, which has dampening our previously 
optimistic outlook for the sector. Two large power projects: PGE's 1.8GW Opole coal-fired power plant and Energa's 
1GW Ostroleka coal power plant, have been delayed and suspended respectively, which will together see contracts 
worth US$5.7bn removed from the immediate project pipeline.
The following projects are in the pipeline:
- Road building programme: Poland's road building programme, running from 2007 to 2015, is expected to draw 
US$60bn of investment into the sector. The much sought-after A1 motorway road project seems to be picking up 
momentum, after Polish authorities, in July 2012, were reportedly inviting design and construction tenders for eight 
sections of a 180km stretch of the A1 highway.
- Airport Investments: The value of the sub-sector more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, to PLN365mn 
(US$123mn). BMI estimates that projects worth more than US$2bn are under way in the airport sub-segment and 
these will together result in annual average real growth of 10% between 2013 and 2017. Adding to the optimism, 
Irish budget carrier Ryanair, in September 2012, revealed plans to launch flights from the new Lublin Airport, which 
is currently being transformed from a military airstrip into a commercial airport.
- Renewable and nuclear power growth: We see solar and offshore wind power being significant beneficiaries of 
government support, after a draft bill released by the Polish economy ministry on July 27 2012 proposed support for 
these power sectors.
Poland continues to lead the region in our ratings, with a score of 65.7 points, due to its stable business 
environment. However, a maturation of the infrastructure environment will mean more limited scope for investors in 
the future, with lower returns on more capital-intensive projects gradually becoming the norm.
The price of this market report covers 4 quarterly reports on this sector. This quarterly report will be downloadable 
instantly as a PDF document, with the 3 remaining reports delivered at regular intervals throughout the year.

Ryanair | Published in: UK News[1]Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (Dec 14th) announced that Stephen 
McNamara, after 4 years of being battered and abused by Michael O'Leary on one side and the European media on 
the other, has decided to pursue an easier life and will, in February next, join the IRFU as their Director of 
Communications. 
 Stephen can expect to take far fewer hits working for Irish rugby than he does working for Ryanair. 
Having joined Ryanair four years ago as its Head of Communications, Stephen has played a leading role in the 
successful growth and development of the airline, which has now become the No.1 carrier in Spain, Italy, Poland 
and the UK, as well as the world's favourite airline, with 79.4m passengers in the current year. Stephen will officially 
leave Ryanair on 7th February next, after an extensive round of lunches and dinners with his many friends and 
admirers in the media, all paid for by the Ryanair press entertainment budget of  3.94. Ryanair confirmed that it will 
now advertise for its Head of Communications vacancy, and see how many PR luvvies apply for what some in the 
media have described as #8216;the worst job in PR#8217;. Working as Ryanair's Head of Communications has 
proven to be an incredible platform for previous incumbents being head hunted to become Director of 
Communications for Kellogg's, the FAI and now the IRFU. Perhaps the GAA or the Irish Olympic Committee will 
come looking for Ryanair's next Head of Communications? If you think you have what it takes to work with Europe's 
largest airline email a CV and covering letter (quoting FRHOC001) to recruitment@ryanair.com[2] Applications 
close on Friday 21st December at 5:30pm (GMT). Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: #8216;I would like to thank 
Stephen for the fantastic job he's done for Ryanair over the last 4 years. As a company that spends little on 
advertising, we rely on our Communications Department to generate loads of free PR, as well as responding to the 
never ending series of absurd claims and fanciful stories that surface on a daily basis. Working in the calm waters 
of Irish rugby should prove a piece of cake after 4 years in Ryanair. We wish Stephen every success as he joins the 
IRFU, and hope that they will be as successful over the next 4 years, as Stephen and Ryanair has been over the 
last 4. #8216;In the meantime we look forward to recruiting another brave soul to take on the #8216;worst job in 
Irish PR#8217; and look forward to grooming the next candidate to take over the high profile and incredibly overpaid 
position as Ryanair's Head of Communications.#8217; Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: #8216;I am sorry to be 
leaving Ryanair after 4 incredible years but I am looking forward to joining a great team at the IRFU. This is one of 
the fastest moving companies in Ireland, and I have enjoyed promoting Ryanair and dealing with the media across 
22 different EU countries, as well as putting out fires, usually late on a Friday afternoon, when some crazy claim 
Ryanair 's Stephen McNamara To Join The IRFU As Ryanair Advertises #8216;The Worst Job In PR#8217;
appears about Ryanair's continuing 28 year success, our incredible safety record and our unbending commitment 
to offering the lowest fares to consumers in every market in which we operate.#8217;
