If given a choice of business partner, 66pc of Ireland's business owners said they would relish some straight-talking 
advice from Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, according to a survey from Sage Ireland.
It found that 79pc of businesses said having the right software is a key factor in success, while 2 out of 3 (66pc) 
said having a business partner on board was important.
The survey also found that a further 25pc said they would listen to insights from the founder of Insomnia coffee 
chain and Dragon, Bobby Kerr.
The most admired business partnership in Ireland for 34pc of respondents is highly successful production duo and 
creators of Riverdance, couple John McColgan and Moya Doherty, while 22pc nominated friends Cullen Allen and 
Colm O'Sullivan, founders of food company Cully and Sully. The third most admired partnership is that between 
brothers Patrick and John Collison, technology entrepreneurs and founders of Shuppa and Stripe. The survey also 
asked business owners who they are most likely to seek advice from, with results showing that 65pc of business 
owners rely on their accountant for guidance, 64pc turn to family and friends and 36pc rely on online forums and 
social media. Sage Ireland, the country's leading software provider with over 40,000 business customers in Ireland, 
has today announced the launch of Sage One Accounts Extra, one of its most significant technology launches in 
Ireland. Simon Hodgkins, Country Manager Sage Ireland said this new offering will enable business owners to both 
track and understand their company performance to a greater degree than ever. "In today and tomorrow's business 
world, our customers need to know what is happening with their company at any stage, regardless of whether they 
might be travelling with business or on-site with a client. Sage One Accounts Extra does just that and, with the 
multi-user capability, if you can't check the data yourself, one of your colleagues will be able to do it instead." "More 
than 6 million businesses worldwide entrust Sage with managing their business data and processes - and 80pc of 
these are start-ups and small businesses. We've taken the insights from working with these customers and brought

The proportion of the UK's largest companies issuing profit warnings over a three-month period fell to its lowest 
level for four years, while warnings from smaller companies was on the rise, according to a report from EY.
Analysis by the professional services firm, formerly known as Ernst & Young , also showed that this was only the 
second quarter since 1999 in which no general retailer issued a warning.
EY found that 3.4 per cent of companies quoted on the main market warned on profits in the three months from July 
to the end of September, compared with 5 per cent in the previous quarter and 6 per cent in the same period last 
year.
But there was a sharp increase in the proportion of Aim-listed companies that had to give the market bad news. It 
rose from 3 per cent in April-June to 4.4 per cent.
One of the most spectacular warnings was issued by Albemarle & Bond, the Aim pawnbroker. Its share price fell 40 
per cent on September 30 as it revealed how badly it had been hit by the falling price of gold and announced plans 
for a rescue rights issue.
Larger companies with warnings included building materials group CRH, Ryanair and Ladbrokes.
Profit alerts from smaller companies on rise; GENERAL FINANCIAL
Keith McGregor, restructuring partner at EY, said the rise in warnings from smaller companies might come in part 
from market volatility. He said SMEs could be more vulnerable in those conditions "because a single contract 
deferral or cancellation may represent a greater proportion of their earnings than it would do for a group with larger 
turnover".
Since warnings reflect not necessarily just poor performance in itself but a mismatch between analysts' forecasts 
and how the company is actually trading, he suggested that the increase could also be partly attributable to how the 
companies interact with the market.
"They may be less experienced or sophisticated than their larger counterparts at dealing with analysts and investors 
and setting market expectations. Also, if there is limited analyst coverage, or if analysts look at them only from time 
to time, then they will find it harder to manage expectations in a way that is easier when coverage is more 
consistent."
The lack of warnings from general retailers during the quarter last occurred at the end of 2009. On that occasion it 
followed a huge spike in warnings over the previous three months, suggesting that the absence of bad news owed 
more to heavily downgraded expectations than to particularly robust trading.
Mr McGregor said that, while lower trading forecasts were one cause for the absence of bad news this time, there 
was also a more positive aspect.
"There is some good economic news and so there is expectation that at some point this will find its way into 
customers' pockets."

As the Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) prepares to launch its first ever press briefing, the airline is taking it to court for as 
yet unspecified reasons.
Papers were lodged in the High Court late last week and an order has been granted allowing for their service 
outside the jurisdiction.
The move comes as the RPG has announced it is to hold its first ever press conference later this month.
The case is against pilots Evert Van Zwol, John Goss, Ted Murphy, Carl Kuwitzky and Samuel Giezendanner, 
some or all of whom are all expected to appear at the Brussels press conference on October 29th. Capt Goss is a 
former Ryanair pilot who was fired after he appeared in a Channel 4 documentary about Ryanair. Both he and 
Channel 4 are now being sued by Ryanair. The nature of the complaint being made by Ryanair against the RPG 
interim council members is not known. Capt Goss was the only member of the council who worked for Ryanair, 
something which Ryanair has used in its criticisms of the group. Asked to comment on the announcement of the 
press conference, a spokesman for Ryanair said: "We don't comment on KLM or Aer Lingus pilots."

WINNERS
**Tourism**
Overall it was a positive budget for the tourism sector, as the 9 per cent VAT rate was retained and the airport travel 
tax reduced to zero. The measures have already prompted Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary into action as 
he plans to grow traffic into Irish airports. The hospitality sector and the tourism lobby launched a strong campaign 
for the retention of the lower Vat rate, with an increase in jobs in the sector helping their argument.
**Construction**
It may not solve all the ills of the still ailing sector, but the home renovation tax incentive scheme should give a lift to 
construction workers and potentially help the state ensure tax compliance in the sector.
The scheme, provides an income tax credit to homeowners calculated at a rate of 13.5 per cent on qualifying 
expenditure over EUR 5,000, up to a max of EUR 30,000.
Noonan also announced EUR 30 million funding for the state's house building programme, which plans to deliver 
500 houses between new buildings and the upgrade of previously uninhabitable units, as well as EUR 10 million 
allocated to work on unfinished estates.
**Farmers**
Irish farmers were happy with the announcement of the new capital gains tax relief scheme which the Irish Cattle 
and Sheep Farmers' Association (ICSA) welcomed as addressing an anomaly which had disincentivised older 
farmers from leasing their land out on a long term basis.
Budget 2014: Budget winners and losers
The ICSA also welcomed funding of EUR 23 million for a scheme to improve genetics in the suckler herd, the 
continuation of the current level of funding for the Disadvantaged Area Scheme and the increase to EUR 15 million 
in funding for the Grassland Sheep Scheme for 2014.
...........................
**LOSERS**
**Pensions industry**
Tuesday's budget did not have much in the way of good news for the financial sector. The pension levy is also 
being increased from 0.6 per cent to 0.75 per cent for next year, and -- rather than then ending as had been 
previously signalled -- remaining at a lower level of 0.15 per cent thereafter.
**Banks**
Banks in particular will not be happy with the fiscal measures included in the budget as they were hit by a levy 
which will be based on their DIRT returns. The increase in DIRT tax to 41 per cent will also be unwelcome. The 
increase, up from 33 per cent last year, means that Dirt has more than doubled since 2008. Among the few 
positives for banks was the announcement that losses incurred on transferring assets to Nama will be countable in 
future against corporation tax payments.
**Pubs**
While publicans will benefit from the retained lower VAT rate, they won't be happy with the excise increases on 
beer, wine and spirits. According to David Smith, chairman of the Irish Brewers Association, the Government is 
putting ''further unnecessary pressure on our sector and its suppliers at a time when it should be offering every 
support possible''.
**Pharmacies**
While in general retailers were not adversely affected by the budget, one part of the sector that did receive bad 
news was pharmacies. Retail Excellence Ireland (REI), the country's largest retail industry body, expressed its 
disappointment at the increase in the pharmacy dispensing fee from EUR 1.50 to EUR 2.50.

Sally Murtagh established Irish HomeCare in 2005 to provide homecare services to elderly people and people with 
disabilities. The company employs 450 professional carers to provide individual care and support services. It is 
headquartered in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and has training centres in Dublin and Offaly. Irish HomeCare's 
sister company, the Irish Healthcare Training Institute, is an accredited FETAC and City & Guilds training centre for 
healthcare and care workers.
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
As managing director, I am responsible for driving the business, providing a uniting vision for the future and setting 
goals and targets for the team.
**What motivates you in your job?**
I want to provide a professional and high quality service to our clients who depend so heavily on us. As a former 
carer, I know what it is like to be with a family who has a loved one who is dying and how much it means to that 
family that their family member is given good quality care. I want Irish HomeCare to be the very best at what we do.
**How would you describe your work style?**
I am inclusive. My door is always open to all employees. I am very open to ideas and contributions and have set up 
a forum for all members of the Irish HomeCare team, so they can have their say. I would never ask a colleague to 
do something I wouldn't do myself.
What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned?
Working Week
Know what you are great at doing, get better at doing it and get someone else to do the other stuff. For example, if 
you hate doing the accounts or paperwork at the end of the month, get someone who loves accounts to do it. That 
will you leave you far more productive in your own work and probably save you money to boot.
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire and why?**
Tony Ryan, co-founder of Ryanair -- not only for his entrepreneurial spirit, but his philanthropic work across all 
sections of the community. We hope in the future to fund local projects in communities we work in.
**What is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
Don't be afraid to make changes in your career and life. Your health, family life and work are all equally important 
and work should not take precedent over the other two. It is hard to make changes but, from my experience, it is 
worth it in the long run.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face?**
We need to create a more supportive environment for entrepreneurs and small businesses. SMEs are the lifeblood 
of communities around the country and we need to make it easier for business people to develop viable, 
sustainable businesses and, in doing so, create employment opportunities around the country.
**What is your ultimate professional goal?**
To continue to provide the best possible quality care to each and every one of our clients and to grow and expand 
the business into the south and west of the country and beyond.

The ISEQ is up a little this morning at 4364, a rise of 10 points as markets are positive about Chinese growth 
figures for the 3rd Quarter.
European Airlines continue to consolidate according to Goodbody Stockbrokers:
Commentary from Air France-KLM CEO, Alexandre de Juniac, would appear to imply that a
takeover over of Alitalia could be on the cards in the near future. He noted that Alitalia should be "integrated into a 
group like ours and integrated means that we should be in a situation to control it". He also stated that Alitalia needs 
a "vigorous industrial restructuring" and a "significant financial overhaul". There was much speculation in the media 
yesterday about what a restructuring at Alitalia would look like. Local press reports suggested that 22 aircraft 
(A320s/Embraers) could be grounded and 2000 staff let go (not enough in our view). We estimate that taking out 22 
aircraft could put up to 5m short haul passengers up for grabs, with Ryanair and easyJet the most likely suitors. 
Sales at Alitalia have been collapsing in recent weeks due to fears over the airline's imminent failure and these are 
sales that could be difficult to recover, even if the carrier does survive. According to the minutes of a recent board 
meeting, Alitalia was worth just E50m before the capital injection received from shareholders and new investors. In 
that context, the E500m bailout looks like a lot to pay for a suffering airline. In our view, Air France-KLM should only 
takeover Alitalia if the airline is allowed to enter bankruptcy, under which circumstances the airline could be stripped 
to the bone with the brand, the long haul network and a few short haul trunk routes kept intact and integrated. 
Taking Alitalia in its current form and injecting capital would most likely lead to further heavy negative returns 
according to Goodbody Stockbrokers.

From Mr Joe Gill.
Sir, Lex (" Dublin up, Dublin down ", October 16) is both convoluted and confused. In the 1800s the Irish Stock 
Exchange was defined by railroad issuers in support of the British empire. After independence it slowly developed 
financial and industrial companies that had an indigenous and UK focus. Since the 1970s it has helped fund a 
group of companies building international footprints. The global financial crisis in 2008 capsized its banking sector 
but a group of industrial companies have used the international catharsis to judiciously expand their operations. Put 
another way, the Irish Stock Exchange flexes and adjusts in response to the corporate drivers that surround it.
To measure Irish industrial company performance you should examine how they stack up using valuation metrics 
favoured by the FT and investors including price/earnings ratios and enterprise value/ebitdas. These show that 
companies such as Kerry Group, Paddy Power, Ryanair, Kingspan, Glanbia, Smurfit Kappa and others are 
consistently valued at the upper end of their international peers across a range of industries despite being listed on 
the Irish Stock Exchange.
There is a lazy narrative which suggests Ireland should quietly allow its capital markets' independence to be 
subsumed into London and New York. Some of us beg to differ. The financial sector is close to completing its 
required restructuring and its importance to the stock market is likely to normalise over the next year. The 
successful launch of Green Reit (to be potentially followed by other indigenous initial public offerings before the 
year end) and this week's move to abolish stamp duty for growth companies joining part of the Irish Stock 
Irish companies more than hold their own against peers
Exchange are better indicators of Ireland's intent. So, too, are the data that show Irish stockbrokers' share of trading 
in those companies that have shifted their listing to London has grown, not declined, in the past year.

NORWEGIAN has become the latest airline to attempt a low-cost service to America, in a coup for Gatwick Airport.
The airline will sell flights to New York next summer for just £149 oneway - an offer made possible by the advent of 
more efficient planes like the new Dreamliner, chief executive Bjorn Kjos said yesterday.
"The airlines that have tried so far have been using 747s and 340s, and none of them, we found, had the cost 
structure that could work," he told City A.M. "In order to succeed you need a profitable and efficient low-cost model - 
if you don't have that there is huge risk. We also have more than 400 routes so we can be our own feeder."
Norwegian aims to keep its introductory fares available for the foreseeable future. It follows previous attempts to 
make cheap transatlantic flights viable including Laker Airways, which offered low fares from Gatwick but went bust 
in 1982.
Even more upmarket airlines such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have cut back on flights to the States in 
recent years. Ryanair has long considered starting a long-haul arm but is yet to take the plunge.
The decision to base the routes at Gatwick, where Norwegian already operates, was a "logical decision" given its 
cheaper airport fees, Kjos said.
However, the move gives a boost to Gatwick as it fights to compete with Heathrow for long-haul traffic.
Airport boss Stewart Wingate described the new service as "a significant industry game-changer".
"This is one of the most exciting route developments since Gatwick's change of ownership four years ago and 
shows the benefits to passengers of Gatwick competing with Heathrow," said Wingate.

The ISEQ remained flat today after yesterday's rally on the last-minute fiscal deal in the US to avert a catastrophic 
default.
The index was down 2.08 points to 4,354.14.
The dollar fell and Wall Street was expected to weaken as relief over a U.S. budget deal gave way to worries over 
the effects of the 16-day government shutdown and prospects of a re-run early next year. The legislation signed 
overnight by President Barack Obama to fund the government until Jan. 15 and extend a debt ceiling deadline to 
Feb. 7 did nothing to resolve the differences over spending and deficits that divide Republicans and Democrats.
At home, Ryanair's shares rose 7c to E6.24. The airline said that it will grow at Irish airports by at least 1m 
passengers a year, starting from April 2014. This is in response to the Irish government's announcement that the 
E3 air travel departure tax from Irish airports will be dropped from April next.

Davy Stockbrokers looks at Ryanair following the ending of the Air Departure Tax in the budget.:
The Irish budget for 2014 included the dropping of the E3 air travel departure tax from April 1st next. As we have 
said before, this will have a positive effect on route development.
Responding to the removal of the tax, Ryanair has said that it will grow traffic at its Irish airports by at least 1m 
passengers a year from April 2014. Over the next two days, the airline is expected to engage with Irish airports to 
determine where it can add new routes and frequencies. Details are likely over the coming weeks. We currently 
assume 81m passengers for Ryanair in its FY 2014 of which we estimate Ireland represents 6-7pc. Over the 
medium term, the company plans to grow total passengers to 110m according to Davy Stockbrokers.

the Senate for final congressional approval, which would clear the way for President Barack Obama to sign into law.
European shares retreated from multi-year highs today as uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling caused some 
traders to trim equity holdings, while LVMH's slower sales growth hit luxury goods stocks. Although the majority of 
investors still expected U.S. lawmakers to eventually reach a deal over the United States' debt ceiling and its 
budget stalemate, some said equity markets would be vulnerable to minor sell-offs until an agreement was secured. 
European Union state aid regulators are investigating whether marketing deals between the Spanish authorities and 
Irish airline Ryanair breach EU rules, the European Commission said today. The investigation by the Commission is 
the latest look into alleged aid granted by European governments seeking to attract airlines to regional airports. The 
EU competition authority said it would examine the marketing agreements for Ryanair and other airlines serving 
Girona-Costa Brava airport to the north of Barcelona and the Reus airport to the south of the Spanish city following 
a complaint from a competitor last year. Shares in Ryanair rose 1c to E6.17.

Ryanair today announced plans to grow its traffic at its Irish airports by at least 1m passengers a year from April 
2014.
It said that this is a direct response to the Govt's announcement in yesterday's budget that the E3 travel tax (which 
applies only to air passengers) will be scrapped in April 2014.
Ryanair highlighted that since the travel tax was introduced in January 2009, traffic at the main Irish airports had 
declined from 30.5m passengers in 2008 to 23.5m in 2012.
It said it believes that much of this traffic can now be recovered thanks to the abolition of the travel tax, which 
makes Ireland a more competitive and attractive destination for inbound visitors, particularly those on short flights 
from the UK and Continental Europe. Ryanair will now respond positively to the Govt's initiative and announce 
plans to grow traffic to/from its Irish airports by at least 1m passengers p.a. from April 2014. The airline has invited 
all the main Irish airports - Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Knock and Kerry - to meetings in Dublin on Thursday and Friday 
of this week to finalise these growth plans and how it can be split between the airports. "These 1m new passengers 
(up to 500,000 visitors) will deliver more visitors than The Gathering in 2013 and will lead to the creation of at least 
1,000 new jobs at these Irish airports where research by the Airport Council International (ACI) demonstrates that 
1,000 new jobs are created at international airports for every 1m additional passengers delivered," a statement from 
the airline said. In Dublin, Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair warmly welcomes the Government's decision to 
repeal the E3 travel tax. This travel tax (originally E10) in 2009 caused Irish air travel and tourism to suffer 
precipitous losses in recent years. The repeal of the air travel tax helps restore Ireland's competitiveness and 
attractiveness to overseas visitors from the UK and Continental Europe in particular. In response to yesterday's 
budget, Ryanair will engage over the next 2 days with all of our Irish airport partners to see how and where we can 
add new routes or additional frequencies on existing routes, and deliver at least 1m new passengers p.a. at these

Austerity's poster child is putting on a new suit, combing its hair, and preparing to return to the financial market. The 
narrative says that Ireland will "graduate" from its emergency financing programme at the turn of the year. It will be 
able to tap private investors once again for its sovereign borrowing needs. Great. But a successful return to the 
markets will not erase one of the worst legacies of its collapse - corporate Ireland's vanishing act.
It is five years since the global financial crisis began, and three since Ireland was forced to accept a EUR67bn 
bailout from international creditors. The country has endured six years of economic dislocation; yesterday's budget 
was the seventh set of austerity measures. This has hollowed out Ireland's stock market.
In 2007 trading volume in Irish equities reached EUR200bn; last year it fell to EUR37bn now that the value of Irish 
banks has collapsed. There were nine initial public offerings in 2007, none in 2010, and one last year. Since 2011, 
five of the biggest Irish companies - CRH, Greencore, United Drug, DCC and Grafton - have moved their primary 
listings to London. Of the four largest companies with Irish primary listings today - Kerry Group (food), Ryanair, Elan 
Corp, and Smurfit Kappa - only the first two have big Irish operations.
Ireland's economic and industrial strategy, focused on foreign direct investment, has created a twin-track economy - 
domestic activity centred on agriculture, construction and services, and an export sector led by technology and 
pharmaceuticals. The strategy rests on its 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate. Given the backlash against multinational 
tax avoidance, this does not look sustainable. A sustained economic recovery is also threatened by a petrified 
banking system nursing a nasty mortgage default problem.
Dublin up, Dublin down
As well as re-establishing itself in the sovereign market, Ireland needs to rebuild its equity investment case. The 
country getting ready to return to the market still has too many echoes of bubble-era Ireland to be a convincing 
"buy" story.

The investigation by the Commission is the latest look into alleged aid granted by European governments seeking

The EU competition authority said it would examine the marketing agreements for Ryanair and other airlines 
serving Girona-Costa Brava aiport to the north of Barcelona and the Reus airport to the south of the Spanish city 
following a complaint from a competitor last year.
"On the basis of the information at its disposal the Commission cannot exclude that the marketing agreements give

Highlight: The Government is to exempt from stamp duty the transfer of shares of companies on the Enterprise

Body
The Government is to exempt from stamp duty the transfer of shares of companies on the Enterprise Securities 
Market (ESM) in today's Budget.
Stamp duty is currently charged at a rate of 1pc on investments made in the shares of Irish companies.
The ISE said it has long campaigned for the removal of stamp duty on investing in Irish companies - this initiative 
enables ESM companies to operate on a level playing field with their international peers when competing for 
international investment. It matches similar proposals made in the UK earlier this year and moves the Irish market 
more in line with European norms.
The exemption of ESM companies from stamp duty, the ISE's market for small to medium sized growth companies, 
supports enterprise, growth and employment in Ireland and will help Irish companies to build scale in their business 
through public markets. It will also have a positive impact on investors including pension funds which invest in the 
shares of Irish companies quoted on the ESM. ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said the proposal is an 
essential step in creating the next generation of leading Irish publicly-quoted companies and meets some of the 
Government's stated objectives in the Action Plan for Jobs - to incentivise dynamic companies to choose growth 
and scale using the IPO route as an alternative to trade sale. "Ireland needs to ensure that Irish companies are as 
attractive as their international peers when it comes to investment. We welcome that ESM companies will now be 
exempt from stamp duty as this tax acted as a barrier to international investment. This initiative is an important step 
in the creation of the next generation of leading companies in Ireland which choose the IPO route to grow - like 
Ryanair, Kerry Group and Paddy Power. High-quality, scalable businesses can create jobs and deliver much 
needed growth in the Irish economy," said Ms Somers.

The exemption of ESM companies from stamp duty, the ISE's market for small to medium sized growth companies, 
supports enterprise, growth and employment in Ireland and will help Irish companies to build scale in their business 
through public markets. It will also have a positive impact on investors including pension funds which invest in the 
shares of Irish companies quoted on the ESM. ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said the proposal is an 
essential step in creating the next generation of leading Irish publicly-quoted companies and meets some of the 
Government's stated objectives in the Action Plan for Jobs - to incentivise dynamic companies to choose growth 
and scale using the IPO route as an alternative to trade sale. "Ireland needs to ensure that Irish companies are as 
attractive as their international peers when it comes to investment. We welcome that ESM companies will now be 
exempt from stamp duty as this tax acted as a barrier to international investment. This initiative is an important step 
in the creation of the next generation of leading companies in Ireland which choose the IPO route to grow - like 
Ryanair, Kerry Group and Paddy Power. High-quality, scalable businesses can create jobs and deliver much 
needed growth in the Irish economy," said Ms Somers.

Stansted chief puts focus on two-runway future for airport

Chief executive, Manchester Airports Group
Airport secures first long-haul flight as part of plan to increase passengers, writes Jane Wild
Body
Manchester Airports Group is focused on expanding Stansted in the next decade to two runways, which would 
support a range of business and leisure, low-cost and premium, long and short-haul flights.
Charlie Cornish, MAG chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he wants to develop the 
Essex airport along the lines of Manchester, the only UK airport other than Heathrow with two runways.
"I think you have to be realistic, Stansted is never going to replace Heathrow as the centre point for long-haul 
flights, but it's got a great opportunity to evolve more like Manchester," he said.
Stansted's proposals to the Davies commission assessing the best way to increase Britain's flight capacity include 
options to build a second runway or expand to a four-runway hub airport. However, four runways could only work if 
Heathrow were to close, which was unlikely, Mr Cornish said, so he was fixing his sights on a two-runway future.
Stansted chief puts focus on two-runway future for airport
MAG, which bought Stansted in February, has already begun an £80m terminal redesign to smooth its security 
checks and improve the airside shops as part of a plan to attract airlines to fly long-haul routes.
Mr Cornish revealed that Stansted had just secured the return of long-haul flying after some years, beginning its 
move away from being purely a base for cheap flights to Europe.
Pakistani carrier Air Blue will start a route to Lahore next year, and detailed talks are under way with several 
airlines, with one close to adding another destination next year, he said. Stansted's main airline, Ryanair, is not one 
of those, despite its chief executive Michael O'Leary having long mooted low-cost long-haul under another brand.
"Stansted's got a good opportunity to fly long-haul to the Middle East and then beyond," Mr Cornish said, citing data 
that showed 3m people travelled past Stansted each year to fly to the Gulf region from Gatwick or Heathrow.
China was also a possible location from Stansted, he said, while MAG's long-held aim of flying between China and 
Manchester would happen within two years. The group has a team in China as part of its Airport City project in 
Manchester. The £800m project to create a business district at Manchester airport involves the Beijing Construction 
Engineering Group, which it is hoped will encourage other Chinese investment.
At Stansted the goal is to reverse the decline of the past few years by raising passenger numbers from 18.5m to 
24m over five years. Stansted has already agreed deals with Ryanair and easyJet to bring in more travellers in 
exchange for lower airport charges.
However, expansion will require improved connections. HS2 - the second phase of which would run to Manchester 
airport - is "fundamental" to lift capacity on Britain's rail network, Mr Cornish said. An obstacle to Stansted's 
development is the rail link to London, which takes between 47 minutes and an hour, which the airport wants to cut 
to 30 minutes.
While the commission, chaired by the economist Sir Howard Davies, needs time to work over the shortlist of options 
for how to boost flight capacity , "it would be difficult for Stansted not to be on it", said Mr Cornish. London's 
population will grow to the east over the next few decades, and noise from Stansted would affect fewer people than 
Heathrow and Gatwick, he said.
But the debate is not about whether the southeast needs a hub airport such as an expanded Heathrow, or the 
London mayor's estuary hub idea - which Mr Cornish thinks will not make the shortlist because of its expense. 
Rather, it is about boosting connectivity, he said, and regional airports have a vital role to play in increasing UK 
airport capacity.
For now, MAG is focusing on Stansted, but in six months, following its integration, it will be open to other 
opportunities, including those abroad, to "add more shareholder value", Mr Cornish said.
MAG is majority owned by Manchester City Council and nine other Manchester authorities. Australian infrastructure 
investor Industry Funds Management holds a 35.5 per cent equity stake and 50 per cent of voting rights.
The group, which also owns East Midlands and Bournemouth airports, looked at operating Chicago Midway airport 
this year. However, it ruled out any interest in Glasgow Prestwick airport , for which the Scottish government may 
seek an operating partner.

Body
Spain will cut the tariffs airlines pay to use the country's airports and remove the charge entirely in some cases in 
an attempt to boost falling traffic, the government said today.
The cuts will reverse increases made over the past two years, which doubled tariffs at Spain's two largest airports in 
Madrid and Barcelona and prompted budget airline easyJet to close its Madrid base and Ryanair to reduce flights 
and routes.
The measure could increase traffic in Spain's 46 airports by about 2pc, or almost 4 million passengers, Public 
Works Minister Ana Pastor said.
Passenger was down 4.9pc year-on-year in the first nine months of the year, or by 7.5 million travellers, on falling 
demand for domestic flights in the midst of an economic slump and the elimination of routes across Spain. The 
reduced tariffs will take effect from January 1, 2014, and will be applicable to new routes and for any moves by 
airlines aimed at increasing air traffic, Spain's airport regulator AENA said. Rates charged per passenger on routes 
that carry additional travellers will be cut by 75pc and new routes will have the tariffs removed completely. (Reuters)

Body
The UK Competition Appeals Tribunal
(CAT) has ordered the UK Competition
Commission (CC) to disclose to Ryanair
redacted sections of a report in which
the CC had instructed the airline to
sell part of its stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus. The CAT has scheduled to hear Ryanair's appeal concerning its 
minority stake in February next year. Will Gant, a writer for the Policy and Regulatory Report (PaRR), which is part 
of the Financial Times Group, said that, in yesterday's case management hearing, the CAT ruled that passages 
dealing with evidence submitted by third parties ought to be revealed to Ryanair's external lawyers. Some parts of 
the CC's final report, published on 28 August, were redacted for reasons of commercial sensitivity. 
In August the CC had ruled that its decision requiring Ryanair to sell down its stake in Aer Lingus would not conflict 
with ongoing appeals before the EU courts aiming to overturn the European Commission's (EC) prohibition of the 
low-cost carrier's bid for the remainder of Aer Lingus, as reported. On 27 February 2013, the EC rejected Ryanair's 
third bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. The merger would have created a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 
routes, the EC found, in spite of receiving no less than five remedy proposals from the low-cost carrier, as reported 
by PaRR. The Ryanair appeal in February will challenge a CC decision that the airline's 29.82pc stake in Aer 
Lingus constitutes a restraint on competition under the UK's Enterprise Act 2002, and must be reduced to a 
maximum of 5pc, Mr Gant wrote. The CC had argued that the redacted parts included submissions from 15 parties 
Ryanair get access to redacted files Ryanair Case
including rivals such as Lufthansa, which had been made in confidence, and that disclosure of their contents would 
deter future participation by third parties in inquiries. Hodge Malek QC, the tribunal chairman, said disclosure to the 
airline's external lawyers should take place within seven days, but on the basis that the identities of the third parties 
remained obscured, the PaRR article said. Daniel Beard QC, for the CC, had likened the airline's application for 
unredacted material to an "expansive fishing expedition". The passages in question are highly sensitive 
submissions made by third parties to the CC, he said. They are concerned that they provided this information to the 
CC on the basis of complete confidence - which is why it is redacted, Beard argued. The CC takes "very, very 
seriously" the protection of confidentiality of information provided, in particular information provided by third parties, 
he continued. Beard highlighted that the system "will not work unless you can get information from third parties, 
who will not give it if they think there is a material risk their key rivals in the market are going to find out their views 
on what is going on in the market". He added that he was aware of a "major breach" of the terms of a 
"confidentiality ring" of the same sort proposed by Ryanair, in which only external lawyers can access material, but 
did not elaborate. "Those sorts of breaches are a real risk," he said. Brian Kennelly, for Ryanair, urged the CAT to 
proceed on the basis that some of the material might be "highly relevant, and we could have made powerful 
submissions if we had seen it". He argued that they needed "the material at this stage to assess its materiality." He 
added: "We have a right to make submissions as to . procedural unfairness - submissions we cannot make without 
seeing the material." Kennelly said unredacted versions of the report would remain with a "shortlist" of external 
lawyers, who would face "very serious professional disciplinary consequences" if they breached confidentiality. "No 
damage would be done unless they are suggesting the external lawyers would somehow disclose this information 
to Ryanair or the public," he said, adding that such a breach would be "unthinkable". Representatives for Aer Lingus 
also opposed Ryanair's application. Ryanair is represented by Brian Kennelly of Blackstone Chambers; Aer Lingus 
is represented by James Flynn QC of Brick Court Chambers.

Body
The UK Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) has ordered the UK Competition Commission (CC) to disclose to 
Ryanair redacted sections of a report in which the CC had instructed the airline to sell part of its stake in Irish rival 
Aer Lingus.
The CAT has scheduled to hear Ryanair's appeal concerning its minority stake in February next year.
Will Grant, a writer for the Policy and Regulatory Report (PaRR), which is part of the Financial Times Group, said 
that, in yesterday's case management hearing, the CAT ruled that passages dealing with evidence submitted by 
third parties ought to be revealed to Ryanair's external lawyers. Some parts of the CC's final report, published on 28 
August, were redacted for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
In August the CC had ruled that its decision requiring Ryanair to sell down its stake in Aer Lingus would not conflict 
with ongoing appeals before the EU courts aiming to overturn the European Commission's (EC) prohibition of the 
low-cost carrier's bid for the remainder of Aer Lingus, as reported. On 27 February 2013, the EC rejected Ryanair's 
third bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. The merger would have created a monopoly or a dominant position on 46 
routes, the EC found, in spite of receiving no less than five remedy proposals from the low-cost carrier, as reported 
by PaRR. The Ryanair appeal in February will challenge a CC decision that the airline's 29.82pc stake in Aer 
Lingus constitutes a restraint on competition under the UK's Enterprise Act 2002, and must be reduced to a 
maximum of 5pc, Mr Grant's report said. The CC had argued that the redacted parts included submissions from 15 
parties including rivals such as Lufthansa, which had been made in confidence, and that disclosure of their contents 
would deter future participation by third parties in inquiries. Hodge Malek QC, the tribunal chairman, said disclosure 
to the airline's external lawyers should take place within seven days, but on the basis that the identities of the third 
parties remained obscured, the PaRR report said. Daniel Beard QC, for the CC, had likened the airline's application 
Ryanair get access to redacted files Ryanair Case
for unredacted material to an "expansive fishing expedition". The passages in question are highly sensitive 
submissions made by third parties to the CC, he said. They are concerned that they provided this information to the 
CC on the basis of complete confidence - which is why it is redacted, Beard argued. The CC takes "very, very 
seriously" the protection of confidentiality of information provided, in particular information provided by third parties, 
he continued. Beard highlighted that the system "will not work unless you can get information from third parties, 
who will not give it if they think there is a material risk their key rivals in the market are going to find out their views 
on what is going on in the market". He added that he was aware of a "major breach" of the terms of a 
"confidentiality ring" of the same sort proposed by Ryanair, in which only external lawyers can access material, but 
did not elaborate. "Those sorts of breaches are a real risk," he said. Brian Kennelly, for Ryanair, urged the CAT to 
proceed on the basis that some of the material might be "highly relevant, and we could have made powerful 
submissions if we had seen it". He argued that they needed "the material at this stage to assess its materiality." He 
added: "We have a right to make submissions as to . procedural unfairness - submissions we cannot make without 
seeing the material." Kennelly said unredacted versions of the report would remain with a "shortlist" of external 
lawyers, who would face "very serious professional disciplinary consequences" if they breached confidentiality. "No 
damage would be done unless they are suggesting the external lawyers would somehow disclose this information 
to Ryanair or the public," he said, adding that such a breach would be "unthinkable". Representatives for Aer Lingus 
also opposed Ryanair's application. Ryanair is represented by Brian Kennelly of Blackstone Chambers; Aer Lingus 
is represented by James Flynn QC of Brick Court Chambers.

Body
The liquidators of IBRC will receive final indicative bids today for loans which were once worth E3.5bn, paving the 
way for the sale of debt attached to landmark businesses such as Arnotts department store.
Bidders for the loans have been poring over detailed information for the past four weeks before making their 
indicative bids by today's deadline.
The liquidators have dubbed the loans sale 'Project Evergreen'.
Those bids will be assessed by IBRC's liquidators, KPMG, before it decides whether a second round of binding bids 
needs to be submitted. A closing round will then follow. The Irish Independent XXXX The Irish-based fund 
managers who led last year's takeover of Eircom made handsome profits of E25m in 2012 and paid more than E3m 
in tax here. Dublin-based Blackstone/ GSO manages funds running to billions of euro and makes its income by 
charging fees for overseeing the investments, including for sitting on steering committees like the one that drove 
last year's multi-billion euro rescue of Eircom. Funds controlled by Blackstone/GSO are the biggest shareholder in 
Eircom following the examinership and debt restructuring, with an 18.6pc stake. The Irish Independent XXXX 
Google's Irish arm paid a whopping E8.6bn in royalties to a Dutch subsidiary last year as the internet giant 
continues to legally exploit international tax structures to reduce its tax bill. Its international sales are recorded by 
the Google arm in Ireland, but it funnels a huge chunk of the money out to the Dutch company, which is in turn 
shifted to Bermuda. The practice is nicknamed the 'Dutch Sandwich'. By using a Bermuda base, Google manages 
to cut its effective tax rate to just 5pc. That compares to the 12.5pc corporate tax rate in Ireland. Google Ireland 
paid just E17m in corporation tax in Ireland last year, despite its revenue ballooning to E15.5bn. The Irish

Ryanair is to hire a new senior executive to spearhead efforts to create a new, softer image after it was voted the 
worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by consumer magazine Which?
The decision comes weeks after chief executive Michael O'Leary promised to transform the company's culture, 
admitting for the first time that a reputation for treating its passengers badly might have become a problem.
The Irish-based airline, which carries more international passengers than any other carrier, frequently features in 
European tabloid newspapers with stories of customers charged huge fines for excess baggage or lost boarding 
passes.
The company will take on a new director for sales and marketing to join an expanded 10-person senior 
management team and become the company's main spokesperson, according to an advertisement on its website. 
The current spokesman is not part of senior management. O'Leary has in the past been Ryanair's de facto 
spokesman, but at the company's annual general meeting last month he admitted his brash style might be a liability. 
The company also advertised for a new commercial director. The two roles will cover the areas of responsibility of 
outgoing deputy chief executive Michael Cawley.

Flights to and from France face disruption today due to a strike by air traffic controllers that has prompted 
companies including EasyJet, Ryanair and Lufthansa to scale back their normal schedule. France's DGAC civil 
aviation authority said it was urging airlines to cut services by 10 per cent, particularly on links between France and 
Spain, Portugal and North Africa. Around 70 per cent of EasyJet's flights operate through French airspace, meaning 
there is a risk of delays and late notice cancellations to many other flights, the airline said. Flights from the UK to 
destinations such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Cyprus, Greece and North Africa face the threat of disruption, it added.

France's DGAC civil aviation authority said it was urging airlines to cut service by 10 percent, particularly on links 
between France and Spain, Portugal and North Africa.
British low-cost airline easyJet and Ireland's Ryanair said they would have to cut about 30 percent of flights as a 
result of the one-day protest over plans for changes to air traffic control practices at European level.
"EasyJet has been asked by the DGAC (France's civil aviation authority) to reduce its French flights by 30 percent 
and as a result will cancel at least 50 flights to and from Paris Charles de Gaulle, Paris Orly, Basel, Bordeaux, Lyon, 
Marseilles and Toulouse," the airline said in a statement today. Around 70 percent of EasyJet's flights operate 
through French airspace, meaning there is a risk of delays and late notice cancellations to many other flights, the 
airline said. Flights from the UK to destinations such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Cyprus, Greece and North Africa face 
the threat of disruption, it added. While European air traffic controller unions have lifted a strike call, two French 
unions representing about a quarter of all controllers in France maintained stoppage plans after talks with the civil 
aviation authority failed. Ryanair said it would be scrapping 70 flights on Thursday, while German airline Lufthansa 
said it would reduce its flights to and from the French cities of Lyon and Marseille but that it believed flights to and 
from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport would not be affected. (Reuters)

Low-cost rivals give Singapore Airlines a bumpy ride

Singapore Girl is flying into turbulence.
For years the advertising icon of Singapore Airlines - a stewardess dressed in a sarong designed by a Parisian 
couturier - has projected an image of unimpeachable reliability and graceful Asian hospitality.
That has helped to create one of the most recognisable and trusted brands in the global airline business.
It has also helped to underpin one of its most financially successful. Singapore Airlines (SIA) has never in its 28 
years as a listed company recorded a loss in any full financial year - a feat virtually unheard of in an industry that 
has bled red ink ever since commercial jet flight began in the 1950s.
But the winds of change are blowing in the Asian airline industry as low cost carriers such as AirAsia, owned by 
Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes , have steadily eaten away at the market share of established carriers 
such as SIA and Cathay Pacific.
They are benefiting from the airborne ambitions of a rising middle class in the region, where millions of people can 
now afford airline tickets for the first time.
Competition between the low-cost airlines themselves has driven down fares to rock bottom levels, with return 
tickets on low cost operators such as Lion Air or AirAsia available in Indonesia for as little as Rp800,000 (US$72).
Low-cost rivals give Singapore Airlines a bumpy ride
One measure of how quickly low-cost carriers have achieved their status is that in the decade since they emerged 
as a force in southeast Asia they now account for about half of seats available in the region, according to the Centre 
for Aviation, an Australian research firm. By contrast the likes of easyJet and Ryanair account for 40 per cent of that 
market in the European Union. Yet low cost players have been around in Europe for at least twice as long as their 
peers in Asia.
As if that were not bad enough for SIA, the airline also faces headwinds from some structural changes in the 
market. First, airlines based in the Middle East - like Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad - have been making 
inroads into Asia.
The much-vaunted "Kangaroo route" to Australia is a vital hinterland for SIA since it and the wider South Pacific 
region accounts for 18 per cent of passenger revenue. But others are muscling in, including Malaysian Airlines, 
which plans to start flying to Darwin.
The Singapore flag carrier is not standing still and has been working on bolstering its position in Asia over the past 
three years.
Last year it launched Scoot, a no-frills subsidiary painted in jaunty yellow livery. Pitched partly to a younger set, it 
flies popular short-break holiday routes to the Gold Coast in Australia and to Taipei.
A tie-up with Virgin Australia in 2011 is helping by allowing SIA to add another 26 "feed points" into its routes on top 
of the six destinations already in the country.
India is the latest - and most intriguing - idea. SIA plans to set up a new Indian carrier with Tata group, the tea-to-
telecoms conglomerate. That raised some eyebrows when it was announced last month since Tata already has a 
tie-up with Mr Fernandes.
But the idea is not only to launch a full-service domestic airline but to capture westbound passenger traffic to the 
Middle East and beyond. That should take the fight back to the Gulf carriers on nonstop flights westwards from the 
subcontinent.
It is too early to say how this pans out. SIA invested S$283m in Scoot, and there is no word yet on when break-
even, let alone profits, will come.
SIA acknowledges that the low-cost carriers have had an impact but insists that by operating across the premium 
and no-frills spectrum it is hedged. It is also expanding with 200 firm orders in hand from Airbus and Boeing, 20 of 
which are for Scoot. Yet Saj Ahmad of consultancy StrategicAeroResearch.com argues that the Gulf airlines do not 
have as many older jets to replace and can therefore be more aggressive.
Unfortunately, the world economy is not helping. Prospects for the airline business in Asia will be hit by a general 
downgrading of growth projections for the region. The International Air Transport Association last month 
downgraded the outlook for the profitability of Asia-Pacific airlines this year by $1.5bn to $3.1bn, largely on slower 
growth in emerging economies.
SIA is doing many of the right things. But relative to Datastream's world airlines index SIA has underperformed by 
23 per cent since the start of the year.
Shareholders will need stronger constitutions if they are to keep the faith with Singapore Girl.

Highlight: Scottish ministers talk to owners
Investors failed to make airport deal
Body
The Scottish government has confirmed it is in talks to take over Glasgow Prestwick airport after talks with potential 
buyers collapsed. The lossmaking airport was put up for sale in March last year by Infratil, a New Zealand 
infrastructure fund company.
Although private investors had been interested, none could make an offer within a time acceptable to its owner, said 
Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister.
Closing the airport would mean a considerable cost to taxpayers, she said. The Scottish government, which already 
has ownership responsibility for 11 mainly small airports around the country, aims to agree terms with Infratil within 
six weeks.
Ms Sturgeon said it would seek a commercial partner to operate Prestwick.
The move would safeguard about 1,400 jobs in an area where unemployment was above average in Scotland, she 
said.
Prestwick on course for state takeover travel & leisure
She added: "Prestwick airport's importance to the local Ayrshire and wider Scottish economy cannot be overstated - 
and it is vital that all efforts are made to keep the airport open."
The Scottish government did not say how much it might cost to take ownership of Prestwick.
Infratil, based in Wellington, said last month that the combined current book value of Prestwick and Kent Manston 
airport, which it also put up for sale, was NZ$20m (£10.3m). Passenger numbers and freight traffic at Prestwick 
have been falling over several years but there was a recent upturn.
Ryanair, which offers flights to 20 European destinations from Prestwick, said it remained committed to the airport. 
"We welcome today's announcement, which gives certainty to the future development of Prestwick airport," it said.
If Prestwick does enter public ownership, it will be the second airport to do so this year, after Cardiff was 
nationalised by the Welsh Assembly .
Other major airports are wholly or substantially owned by the public sector - Manchester and Stansted under 
Manchester Airports Group , and Newcastle, run by a public-private partnership - with local councils holding a 
majority stake.
"Prestwick Airport can have a positive future . . . and without any negative impact on Scotland's other airports," the 
deputy first minister said. "With perseverance, patience and some innovative thinking, it is our belief and intention 
that the airport can and will be brought back into profit."
However, she gave no details of how the Scottish government might turn round the airport's fortunes. Prestwick's 
location, a 40-minute drive south of Glasgow, has left it at a disadvantage to rivals closer to urban centres.
Making Prestwick profitable would not be easy, said Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant. "They have probably 
bought it for wider social and political reasons," he said.
"It's very difficult to see why and how they're going to make a go of it against the background of very well 
established and significantly larger airports in Glasgow and Edinburgh, which have a much greater service by a 
wide range of airlines."

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd. has reported that passenger traffic for the month of September 2013 was 8.1 million 
passengers, an increase of 3%, compared to 7.84 million passengers in September 2012.
Body
Load factor for the month of September 2013 was 85%, an increase of one percentage point, compared to 84% for 
September 2012. For the year-to-date period, total passenger traffic was 80.4 million passengers, an increase of 
2%, compared to the corresponding period of 2012. Robin Kiely, head of communications at Ryanair, said: "Ryanair 
carried over 8m passengers in September 2013 and our load factor rose by 1% from 84% to 85%, as we enjoyed a 
record 12-months with over 80m passengers choosing one of our ultra-low fares. We also carried over 9m in 
August - the first European airline to ever do so. "It's easy to see why so many passengers choose Ryanair, as we 
offer Europe's lowest fares with no fuel surcharges guaranteed, across over 1,600 routes, connecting 180 
destinations in 29 countries, while delivering Europe's No 1 customer service, with the most on-time flights, the 
fewest cancellations and least mishandled bags."

From Ms Olivia Blacque.
Sir, I would like to commend David McWilliams' article " The misery of a Ryanair flight is a common tie that binds " 
(September 28). Ryanair has enabled many, many people to travel to the "back of beyond Europe" and experience 
wonderful holidays at very affordable prices - the airline has democratised travel - and always with a great story to 
tell on return.
I was also most interested to read that the company has EUR3.5bn sitting on deposit. I wonder, would Ryanair 
consider setting up an entrepreneurial investment fund for Ireland? Ireland is on its knees, and never before has the 
country been in so much need of a helping hand from talented and successful people, such as Michael O'Leary, to 
help it get back on its feet.
An alarming and incredibly worrying amount of university-educated young leave our shores every day as they 
simply cannot find employment here.
Would Ryanair consider helping to set up entrepreneurial clusters all around provincial Ireland? If the fund could 
lend money at low rates of interest to aspiring entrepreneurs to give them a chance to create start-ups, the growing 
agribusiness sector, in particular, would really benefit from this.
Success breeds success.
Olivia Blacque,

From Mr Graham Hurley.
Sir, David McWilliams' allegations of "unspeakable public degradation" of its passengers will not deter core Ryanair 
customers such as myself (" The misery of a Ryanair flight is a common tie that binds ", Comment, September 28). 
By contrast, upon witnessing "stand-offs at the departure desks . . . as customers try to cram their beloved 
possessions into the narrow cages used by Ryanair" to levy substantial extra charges, I am reassured that I am 
paying the lowest possible fare - effectively subsidised by those other passengers who have neglected to study and 
obey Ryanair's published terms and conditions.
My modest social occasions feature trading of stories such as how I happily travelled from Turin to Stansted for 
thirty quid.

The ISEQ managed some small gains in nervous trading as investors awaited developments in the US Budget

The ISEQ was up 17.59 points to 4,278.35.
European shares edged up to end a two-day losing run, with Deutsche Telekom outperforming, while expectations

Air France hesitation on Alitalia is better part of valour

Body
The horns of the dilemma on which Europe's airline industry sits are painfully sharp. On the one hand, European 
airlines are, on average, less profitable than those of any continent except Africa. This is hardly a surprise: at the 
last count, there were 217 of them. On the other hand, one plausible remedy - mergers and shutdowns, so that the 
best-managed airlines achieve higher margins and the weakest fade away - remain frustratingly out of reach.
Nothing better illustrates this dilemma than the hesitation of Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline by revenue, 
over what to do with its 25 per cent stake in Alitalia. After the Italian airline's announcement last week that it needs 
a EUR100m capital increase, Air France-KLM faces three choices, each of which is as discomforting as a sudden 
loss of cabin pressure in a flight over the Alps.
The first choice is to increase the Franco-Dutch group's shareholding in Alitalia, and even to make it a controlling 
stake. Such a step would represent an astonishing triumph of hope over experience. It would be inspired by the 
notion that the former flag-carrier will one day stop bleeding the money that the Italian state, banks and other 
companies have poured into it year after year.
In recent days, members of Italy's fragile coalition government have dropped hints that they would be happy for Air 
France-KLM to double its stake. But there is a catch, as there usually is with Alitalia. Italian politicians want a 
binding promise from any future foreign owner of the airline that it will use Rome's Fiumicino airport as a hub, 
especially for long-haul flights. Furthermore, it must integrate Alitalia into its operations as an equal partner, not 
some washed-up scrounger.
Air France hesitation on Alitalia is better part of valour
For Air France-KLM, these are difficult conditions to swallow. Anything that threatens to tie the group's hands and 
that dooms Alitalia to remain a perennial lossmaker is, however, a non-starter - as Alexandre de Juniac , chief 
executive of Air France-KLM, indicated this week.
The second option is to pull out of Alitalia altogether on the grounds that Air France-KLM, particularly the struggling 
French half of the group, has more than enough financial and strategic problems of its own to fix.
Abandoning Alitalia might provide a shortlived emotional gratification, akin to that felt upon scrambling out of a bad 
marriage. But for Air France-KLM, it is not a satisfactory long-term answer. It would simply strengthen the position in 
the Italian market, and therefore in Europe more generally, of rivals such as Ryanair, Lufthansa and easyJet.
The third choice for Air France-KLM is to sit tight and do nothing, except perhaps to sprinkle some alms in Alitalia's 
latest begging bowl. But this is hardly a solution, either. The EUR100m capital increase, due for approval at an 
Alitalia shareholders' meeting on October 14, will no more restore the airline's fortunes than one life jacket would 
save a whole flight crew.
The airline's first-half net loss was EUR294m, 46 per cent up on a year earlier. Its net debt was EUR946m and its 
liquidity was EUR128m. Plainly, Alitalia is no closer to financial health than it was in 2009 when Silvio Berlusconi, 
the former premier , hustled a group of mainly Italian investors into acquiring stakes in order to thwart an Air 
France-KLM takeover.
From time to time, it is suggested that Alitalia's salvation will come from non-European investors - from China, 
Japan, Russia or the Gulf. After all, Air France-KLM launched a code-share pact last year with Abu Dhabi-based 
Etihad Airways, the Gulf's third biggest carrier. Might this pair consider a joint effort not just to keep Alitalia in the 
skies but to restructure it so that, dare one say it, the airline actually makes some money for once?
Maybe, but Etihad would surely never buy into Alitalia unless it felt confident of success in treacherous political and 
industrial territory where everyone else has failed. Nowadays, Alitalia accounts for only 12 per cent of seat capacity 
on flights in and out of Italy. It has a much higher cost base than its more efficient budget airline competitors. It has 
a long and, by European standards, incomparably ghastly record of managerial incompetence, restive trade unions 
and unhelpful attention from politicians. Why would Etihad want to go anywhere near it?
In this sense Alitalia's plight is emblematic of many failing European airlines. It is chronically unprofitable. It is 
probably impossible to turn round. But politicians in its home country will not let it die, and so it refuses to go away. 
Air France-KLM is doing the right thing by not rushing into a deal.

Air France hesitation on Alitalia is better part of valour

The horns of the dilemma on which Europe's airline industry sits are painfully sharp. On the one hand, European 
airlines are on average less profitable than those of any continent except Africa. This is hardly a surprise: at the last 
count, there were 217 of them. On the other hand, one plausible remedy - mergers and shutdowns, so that the 
best-managed airlines achieve higher margins and the weakest fade away - remain frustratingly out of reach.
Nothing better illustrates this dilemma than the hesitation of Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline by revenue, 
over what to do with its 25 per cent stake in Alitalia. After the Italian airline's announcement last week that it needs 
a EUR100m capital increase, Air France-KLM faces three choices, each of which is as discomforting as a sudden 
loss of cabin pressure in a flight over the Alps.
The first choice is to increase the Franco-Dutch group's shareholding in Alitalia, and even to make it a controlling 
stake. Such a step would represent an astonishing triumph of hope over experience. It would be inspired by the 
notion that the former flag-carrier will one day stop bleeding the money that the Italian state, banks and other 
companies have poured into it year after year.
In recent days, members of Italy's fragile coalition government have dropped hints that they would be happy for Air 
France-KLM to double its stake. But there is a catch, as there usually is with Alitalia. Italian politicians want a 
binding promise from any future foreign owner of the airline that it will use Rome's Fiumicino airport as a hub, 
especially for long-haul flights. Furthermore, it must integrate Alitalia into its operations as an equal partner, not 
some washed-up scrounger. For Air France-KLM, these are difficult conditions to swallow. Anything that threatens 
Air France hesitation on Alitalia is better part of valour
to tie the group's hands and that dooms Alitalia to remain a perennial lossmaker is, however, a non-starter - as 
Alexandre de Juniac , chief executive of Air France-KLM, indicated this week.
The second option is to pull out of Alitalia altogether on the grounds that Air France-KLM, particularly the struggling 
French half of the group, has more than enough financial and strategic problems of its own to fix. Abandoning 
Alitalia might provide a shortlived emotional gratification, akin to that felt upon scrambling out of a bad marriage. But 
for Air France-KLM, it is not a satisfactory long-term answer. It would simply strengthen the position in the Italian 
market, and therefore in Europe more generally, of rivals such as Ryanair, Lufthansa and easyJet.

LOW-COST airline EasyJet has lifted its annual profit forecasts even further after revenues per seat over the 
summer rose more than hoped.
EasyJet said it now expects to report pre-tax profits of £470m to £480m for the year to the end of September, at the 
top end of its predictions in July, which had already been upgraded.
At the top end of this range, EasyJet will be delivering a whopping 51 per cent surge in annual pre-tax profits.
The FTSE 100 firm believes revenues per seat jumped six per cent, at the high end of previous guidance, while 
costs were up four per cent, as expected.
The Luton-based airline said its strategy of adding flights on routes where rivals were cutting back had added to its 
summer growth.
Its upbeat outlook contrasts with that of rival Ryanair, which last month warned that its profits might come in below 
forecasts.
"EasyJet has delivered a strong performance in the last twelve months due to management action to generate 
value to our customers and maintain a tight control of costs combined with an unusually benign capacity 
environment," said chief executive Carolyn McCall.
The company also posted a 4.8 per cent rise in traffic for September, carrying 5.7m passengers. In the year to 
September, traffic was up four per cent to 60.75m.

The Government has received a timely boost ahead of this month's budget with the latest exchequer numbers

Ryanair Fined $13 Million For Breaching French Labor Laws
Ryanair Fined $13 Million For Breaching French Labor Laws

(RTTNews) - A court in France has ordered Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYA.L) to pay EUR10 million ($13 
million) in damages and fines for breaching French labor laws at its operation in Marignane, near the southern port 
city of Marseille, French media reported on Wednesday.
Ryanair faced multiple charges, including registering workers employed in France as Irish employees, preventing 
workplace councils from functioning and preventing staff from having free access to unions.
The case relates to a facility the company operated at Marignane with 127 employees for whom the airline 
neglected to apply French labor laws or complete tax declarations for them. Ryanair argued that Irish law applied to 
the employees, as it did not have a permanent base in the area and its staff took their orders from company 
headquarters in Dublin.
The prosecution told the court that "we are dealing with a company whose only goal is to counter the law in 
defiance of the interests of workers."
Ryanair, which plans to appeal the ruling, has accused France's judicial authorities of pursuing the case to protect 
the interests of French companies, including flag carrier Air France which has been under tremendous pressure due 
to the popularity of low-cost carriers such as Ryanair, the France24 TV reported.

(RTTNews) - European stocks are seen opening higher on Thursday after official data showed activity in China's 
service sector expanded at its fastest pace in six months in September, offsetting concerns over the partial 
shutdown in the U.S. China's official non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index, which covers services 
including aviation, real-estate, retail, software, retail and construction sectors, rose to 55.4 in September from 53.9 
in the previous month, a survey by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing revealed.
With the U.S. government remaining in partial shutdown for two days, the release of U.S. reports on weekly jobless 
claims and factory orders has been postponed. President Barack Obama summoned the top four leaders of 
Congress to the White House yesterday for the first high-level talks to help prevent a potentially catastrophic debt 
default in two weeks. The talks didn't lead to a breakthrough as both sides blamed each other for the budget 
impasse over Obamacare.
Asian stocks are broadly higher, with positive Chinese data and waning expectations of an imminent Fed tapering 
underpinning sentiment. The dollar is coming under pressure, lifting some emerging market currencies, as investors 
brace for a bigger showdown over raising the U.S. government's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling. The Chinese market 
remains shut until October 7 for National Day holidays while South Korea's stock market is closed for the National 
Foundation Day.
Closer home, retail sales and final PMI data from major European economies will be released later in the session. 
The voting on next year's overall EU budget will continue on Thursday after a European Parliament Committee 
voted in favor of cutting its administrative budget by almost EUR 10 million compared to the European 
Commission's June draft budget.
The European Parliament as a whole will vote its position on the 2014 budget on October 23 in Strasbourg. If 
conciliation talks between the European Council and Parliament produce an agreement, it will be put to a plenary 
vote at the November session.
In corporate news, the European Commission announced that the aid granted by France to the motor vehicle 
manufacturer Renault to help it conduct the 'HYDIVU' research and development program complies with the EU 
rules on state aid.
BHP Billiton outlined its productivity agenda to capitalize on the next phase of the Asian growth cycle.

Athene Holding said that it has closed the acquisition of British insurer Aviva Plc.'s Aviva USA Corp. and its 
subsidiaries, including Iowa-domiciled Aviva Life and Annuity Co., and New York-domiciled Aviva Life and Annuity 
Co. of New York, for $1.55 billion.
A French court on Wednesday ordered Ireland-based low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. to pay 8 million euros in 
fines and damages for violating French labor laws by employing Marseille-based crew under Irish contracts.
The European markets finished solidly in negative territory on Wednesday after the European Central Bank left 
interest rates unchanged and took no policy action to inject fresh stimulus into the region's economy. Italian Prime 
Minister Enrico Letta won a confidence vote in parliament, easing concerns about a fresh round of potentially 
inconclusive elections. The German DAX dropped 0.7 percent, France's CAC 40 fell 0.9 percent and the U.K.'s 
FTSE 100 shed 0.4 percent.
U.S. stocks also drifted lower as a report from payroll process ADP showing weaker than expected private sector 
growth in September added to concerns about the economic impact of a prolonged government shutdown and the 
looming debt ceiling. The Dow slipped 0.4 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 dropped about 
0.1 percent each.

A French court has ordered Ryanair to pay EUR9m in damages and fines for breaking local labour laws when the 
low-cost airline employed staff on Irish contracts at a now-closed base in the south of France.
The court judgment said Ryanair's operation amounted to "veritable social dumping", the news agency AFP 
reported.
"The level of social charges in France are 40-45 per cent [of wages] for the employer, against 10.75 per cent in 
Ireland, an issue of unfair competition against other airlines that respect national legislation."
Ryanair, which accused the authorities of using the case to protect Air France-KLM from competition, said it would 
appeal against the decision "all the way to the European courts".
Ryanair has 7 per cent market share in France, behind Air France and easyJet.
It added: "These people were employed on Irish contracts, operating on Irish registered aircraft [defined as Irish 
territory] and have already paid their taxes, social taxes and state pension contributions in Ireland, in full compliance 
with Irish and EU regulations."
The court in Aix-en-Provence ignored a plea from prosecutors to fine Ryanair the value of the four aircraft it flew 
from the base, imposing instead a fine of EUR200,000. But lawyers involved in the case said the judgment included 
French court orders Ryanair to pay EUR9m over employee contracts
almost EUR9m that Ryanair must pay in damages and interest to social security, pension and employment 
agencies and trade unions affected.
Similar rulings in 2010 and 2012 against Ryanair's low-cost rivals easyJet and CityJet, saw them having to pay 
about EUR1.5m and EUR1m respectively.
All three still fly to French destinations.
The case stemmed from Ryanair's use of Irish contracts when it set up an operational base employing up to 127 
people, including French, at Marignane, near Marseille, from 2006 until the end of 2010, when it closed following 
the court action.

Similar rulings in 2010 and 2012 against rivals easyJet and CityJet, saw them having to pay about EUR1.5m and 
EUR1m respectively. All three airlines still fly to France.
The case stemmed from Ryanair's use of Irish contracts when it set up a base in 2006 near Marseille employing up 
to 127 people, including French staff. It closed in 2010 following the court action. The move enabled Ryanair to 
avoid paying France's high taxes.
But the agencies and unions that backed the case said the set-up was a fiction, arguing that Ryanair's offices, 
equipment and management at the base showed its operation was implanted in France and should be subject to 
French rules.
The court agreed, convicting the airline of "concealed employment".
But Ryanair said a 2006 French decree that applied French social charges to foreign airlines was introduced as 
"state protection for the lossmaking Air France" against which it was competing. Ryanair has 7 per cent market 
share in France, behind Air France and easyJet.
Ryanair said there was a "clear contradiction" between EU rules and the French decree.
One of those involved in the case was the pilot Morgan Fischer . In 2010, he wrote a letter to the Financial Times 
suggesting that Michael O'Leary, chief executive, could be replaced by a "probationary cabin crew member".
It followed a comment by Mr O'Leary that airlines could "save a fortune" if flight attendants replaced co-pilots on 
aircraft on which "the computer does most of the flying". Mr Fischer resigned from Ryanair after being reassigned to 
Lithuania.
SNPL, the French pilots' union, said it was satisfied with the court decision.

Highlight: Staff at French airport had Irish contracts
Airline labels court ruling protectionism
Body
A French court has ordered Ryanair to pay EUR9m in damages and fines for breaking local labour laws when the 
low-cost airline employed staff on Irish contracts at a now-closed base in the south of France.
The court judgment said Ryanair's operation amounted to "veritable social dumping", the news agency AFP 
reported.
"The level of social charges in France are 40-45 per cent [of wages] for the employer, against 10.75 per cent in 
Ireland, an issue of unfair competition against other airlines that respect national legislation."
Ryanair, which accused the authorities of using the case to protect Air France-KLM from competition, said it would 
appeal against the decision "all the way to the European courts".
"These people were employed on Irish contracts, operating on Irish-registered aircraft [defined as Irish territory] and 
have already paid their taxes, social taxes and state pension contributions in Ireland, in full compliance with Irish 
and EU regulations," it said.
Ryanair to fight EUR9m sanction
The court in Aix-en-Provence ignored a plea from prosecutors to fine Ryanair the value of the four aircraft it flew 
from the base, imposing instead a fine of EUR200,000.
But lawyers involved in the case said the judgment included almost EUR9m that Ryanair must pay in damages and 
interest to social security, pension and employment agencies and trade unions affected.
Similar rulings in 2010 and 2012 against Ryanair's low-cost rivals easyJet and CityJet, saw them having to pay 
about EUR1.5m and EUR1m respectively. All three airlines still fly to French destinations.
The case stemmed from Ryan-air's use of Irish contracts when it set up an operational base employing up to 127 
people, including French staff, at Marignane, near Marseille, from 2006 until the end of 2010, when it closed 
following the court action.
The move enabled Ryanair to avoid paying France's high social security charges and other taxes on labour.
But the agencies and unions that backed the case against it said the set-up was a fiction, arguing that Ryanair's 
offices, equipment and management based at Marignane showed its operation was implanted in France and should 
be subject to French rules.
The court agreed, convicting the airline of "concealed employment".
But Ryanair said a 2006 French decree that applied French social security charges to foreign airlines was 
"specifically introduced as further state protection for the lossmaking Air France" against which it and other low-cost 
airlines were competing.
Ryanair has 7 per cent market share in France, behind Air France and easyJet.

Body
No sign of Ryanair's new, softer side in its response to a EUR9m penalty from a French court for breaking local 
labour laws. The low-cost airline is already planning its flight path to the European courts.
When Ryanair closed the base near Marseille in 2010, after the court action began, it turned its back on the sort of 
French expansion enjoyed by easyJet. The orange airline did not let its own similar EUR1.5m penalty in 2010 get in 
the way of establishing itself as the second-largest carrier in France, with regional bases at Lyon, Nice and 
Toulouse.
Low-cost airlines in general should find that there is enough European aviation growth to go around, especially with 
opportunities in the business travel market where Ryanair is playing catch-up.
So perhaps it hasn't lost out from quitting Marseille. Still, it is surprising that an airline famous for its "macho" culture 
did not want to stamp its presence more heavily in a market where it believed Air France was so feeble that it 
needed French labour laws to protect it from full-on competition.

The ISEQ lost ground as investors digested the ECB's wait-and-see policy while the deadlock over the US Budget 
weighed on global markets.
The ISEQ was down 13.37 points to 4,269.52.
The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged today, holding off any fresh policy action for now while it 
waits to see whether a fragile euro zone recovery strengthens. Financial market attention now shifts to ECB 
President Mario Draghi's news conference, at which he is likely to keep open the options of an interest rate cut or a 
bumper cash injection into the banking system should the euro zone outlook sour.
Concerns over a U.S. government shutdown saw the dollar slip to a one month low against the yen. Traders said 
markets could be in for a volatile session with no sign of an end to Washington's political deadlock, although most 
investors still expect the situation to be short-lived. Shares in Ryanair fell by 4c to E6.35. Ryanair carried 8.1 million 
passengers in September - a 3pc rise compared to the same month last year. The airline carried 80.4m travellers in 
the year to the end of last month, a rise of 2pc compared to a year ago. Its load factor - an industry-wide measure of 
how well airlines fill their aircraft, stood at 85pc - 1pc up on the previous year.

A French court ordered low-cost carrier Ryanair to pay over E8 million in fines and damages today over labour code 
breaches linked to treatment of local workers hired on foreign contracts.
The Irish airline, known as a pioneer of no-frills travel, was on trial in France on charges covering a range of alleged 
labour code violations connected to its Marseille operating hub between 2006 and 2010.
The court in southern France ordered Ryanair to pay 200,000 euros of fines, in addition to 4.5 million euros of 
backdated social charges, 3 million in pension contributions and 450,000 euros in unemployment charges.
The court found that Ryanair had breached the labour code by not paying French social and other charges for 
workers hired abroad but WHO spent much of their time at the Marseille hub. Ryanair had already said in a 
statement issued on Tuesday that it had expected a negative ruling and would appeal it. "We will appeal... on the 
basis that European employment and social security law clearly allows mobile workers on Irish- registered aircraft, 
working for an Irish airline, to pay their taxes and social taxes in Ireland," the statement read. Ryanair has since 
shut its permanent Marseille hub and operated a summer-only operation since April, 2011.

Ryanair Fined 8 Mln Euros For Violating French Labor Laws
Ryanair Fined 8 Mln Euros For Violating French Labor Laws

Body
(RTTNews) - A French court on Wednesday ordered Ireland-based low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, 
RYAAY) to pay 8 million euros, or $10.88 million, in fines and damages for violating French labor laws by employing 
Marseille-based crew under Irish contracts. However, Ryanair said it will appeal the French court's ruling and fines.
Ryanair noted that the majority of the fines imposed by the Aix En Provence Court in France related to alleged non-
payment of social insurance and state pension contributions in France for Ryanair crew flying to and from Marseille 
during the period between 2007 and 2010.
The company said that the fines were imposed despite the fact the employees were on Irish contracts, operating on 
Irish registered aircraft and had already paid their taxes, social taxes and state pension contributions in Ireland, in 
full compliance with Irish and European Union regulations.
But the French court ruled that Ryanair must comply with a 2006 decree that requires airlines in France to pay their 
staff under French contracts and also file taxes as well as social security contributions in France.
According to Ryanair, there was a clear contradiction between current EU employment regulations under which 
these Irish workers paid their taxes and social taxes in Ireland, and the 2006 French decree that seeks to require 
airline crews operating in Ireland to pay social taxes and pension contributions in France, despite these already 
having been paid in Ireland.
Ryanair said it will appeal the French court's ruling and fines. The company added that the contradiction can 
ultimately only be resolved by the European Courts upholding EU regulations on the employment of mobile 
transport workers, and it intends to pursue this appeal all the way to the European Courts.
Further, Ryanair said that if it was ultimately forced to pay these social taxes and pension contributions in France, 
then the vast majority of these contributions would be reclaimable from the Irish Government.
Robin Kiely, Head of Communications, Ryanair said, "Ryanair will study today's ruling in detail, and will be lodging 
an early appeal. Since all of our people operating to/from Marseille between 2007 and 2010 have already paid their 
social taxes and pension contributions in Ireland, in full compliance with Irish and EU employment regulations, we 
do not believe that either Ryanair or our people can be forced to double pay these contributions a second time in 
France."
Ryanair Fined 8 Mln Euros For Violating French Labor Laws
Kiely added that Ryanair would continue to comply fully with Irish and EU employment law, income taxes and social 
tax obligations.
In a separate statement, Ryanair said that the traffic for the month of September rose 3 percent from the year-ago 
period to 8.10 million passengers. Load factor for the month rose to 85 percent from 84 percent in the same period 
last year.
Further, the company noted that its annual traffic to end September grew 2 percent to 80.4 million passengers.
RYAAY closed Wednesday's regular trading on the Nasdaq at $50.02, up $0.11 or 0.22 percent on a volume of 
371894 shares.

Budget airline Ryanair has been ordered to pay almost 8 million euros ($10.8 million) in damages and interest for 
breaking French labor law, according to a lawyer for a group of the carrier's French pilots.
Claire Hocquet, a lawyer for the SNPL pilots union that brought the case, said the court in Aix-en-Provence found 
the airline broke the law by not paying French social security and pension contributions for employees of its 
Marseille hub between 2006 and 2010. She said it also fined the Irish airline 200,000 euros ($270,440).
The court rejected Ryanair's argument that because its pilots worked in Irish-registered jets, it should be permitted 
to pay these charges in Ireland rather than France.
Ryanair has already said it will appeal the ruling. In a statement, the airline said French law and EU regulations are 
in contradiction on the question of where employment charges must be paid.
The case echoed a similar ruling in 2010 against rival low-cost airline easyJet PLC. The British company was

Ryanair carried 8.1 million passengers in September - a 3pc rise compared to the same month last year.
The airline carried 80.4m travellers in the year to the end of last month, a rise of 2pc compared to a year ago.
Its load factor - an industry-wide measure of how well airlines fill their aircraft, stood at 85pc - 1pc up on the 
previous year.
"Ryanair carried over 8m passengers in September 2013 and our load factor rose by 1pc from 84pc to 85pc, as we 
enjoyed a record 12-months with over 80m passengers choosing one of our ultra-low fares. We also carried over 
9m in August - the first European airline to ever do so," said Ryanair's Robin Kiely.

court prepares to issue a ruling on whether the Irish airline violated French employment laws.
Body
Ryanair faces the possibility of having four of its aircraft confiscated in Aix-en-Provence in France as a court 
prepares to issue a ruling on whether the Irish airline violated French employment laws.
The Irish airline today said it fully expects to lose the case and acknowledged it - at the very lease - faces a hefty 
fine.
Prosecutors say Ryanair circumvented French law by issuing Irish contracts to 127 staff its Marseille base.
According to the local press, prosecutors have called for the sequestration of four aircraft. Ryanair confirmed, in 
response to queries, that it expects a negative ruling and a fine in the Aix-en-Provence Court tomorrow. "This ruling 
will be based, in particular, on the French Decree which was introduced in Nov 2006, after Ryanair's operational 
base in Marseille had opened. Already under this decree, rulings against Easyjet (Apr 2010) and Cityjet (Mar 2012) 
have been made under which those airlines incurred fines, penalties and back-charges of approx E1.6m and E1m 
respectively," a Ryanair spokesman said. "Since the crew operating Ryanair's flights to and from Marseille worked 
for an airline with its registered office in Ireland and spent their working day on Irish registered aircraft, they are 
considered to be working principally in Ireland and not in France. Ryanair crews were correctly working under Irish 
contracts of employment and paying Irish social insurance in accordance with the applicable European employment 
and social security laws. Ryanair does not believe that the 2006 Decree applied to its operations in Marseille but 
following decisions against other airlines such as Easyjet and Cityjet, it expects a negative ruling at this first stage of 
these proceedings in France. Ryanair confirms that it will appeal any such negative ruling and any attempt by the 
French authorities to seek payment of social insurance payments which have already been paid in full in Ireland," 
Ryanair said.

Low cost European carrier Ryanair has shrunk its annual profit forecast from EUR570 million ($770 million) to 
EUR510 million for this financial year, blaming intense competition for the downturn.
The airline recently said it planned to introduce allocated seats on its flights, in a bid to attract customers from its 
budget rivals such as EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
In March Ryanair placed a $15.6 billion deal with Boeing for 175 737 narrowbodies.

Body
Ryanair this morning retracted its appeal against an enforcement action issued by the National Consumer Agency 
which claimed that the airline was in breach of e-commerce rules by not publishing an email address on its Website.
The NCA contend that Ryanair customers can't contact the airline rapidly and in a direct and effective manner 
without the proper contact information.
The National Consumer Agency viewed this as a contravention of E-Commerce legislation, which imposes a direct 
obligation on traders providing an e-commerce service, including airlines, to provide consumers with an email 
address.
This follows action the Agency successfully brought against Aer Lingus, for similarly failing to provide an email 
address to facilitate contact from its customers. Following an assessment under E-Commerce legislation, the 
National Consumer Agency issued Ryanair with a Compliance Notice, under the Consumer Protection Act 2007, 
directing that the company provide an email address on its website, so that consumers could contact the airline 
rapidly and can communicate with it directly and effectively. Ryanair exercised its right of appeal to the Compliance 
Notice to the Swords District Court, and the case was listed for today. This morning Ryanair informed the court that 
the appeal was being withdrawn. Therefore the Compliance Notice issued by the Agency stands and Ryanair has 
published an email address in the "Contact Us" area on its site. Karen O'Leary, Chief Executive of the National 
Consumer Agency, said, "There are basic obligations that traders must adhere to when carrying out business with 
consumers over the internet, including the provision of an email address to facilitate contact by consumers. This 
requirement is set out in law and the National Consumer Agency is ensuring that traders, including airlines, comply 
with their obligations."

Body
Earlier this month Ryanair decided that being horrid to customers was not a great business strategy and declared it 
would be a bit nicer. This was pretty remarkable and has, indeed, been much remarked upon.
Yet even more remarkable was what caused chief executive Michael O'Leary to make this U-turn . It was not 
market research. It was not social networks. It certainly was not anything to do with management consultants, 
whom Mr O'Leary once said he would shoot if they ever darkened his doorstep. Nor was it due to pressure from the 
board.
Instead, the trigger was people who periodically accost him in McDonald's to moan about his airline while he sits 
trying to enjoy a meal with his kids. As he said to shareholders at last week's annual meeting, he is sick and tired of 
it.
So never mind big data. When it comes to bringing about change it is criticism delivered in person by random 
strangers that counts. Mr O'Leary is unusual in many ways, but in this one I suspect he is just like the rest of us.
On the face of it, placing so much emphasis on such meetings is irrational. The people who bearded him were 
surely no more disaffected than the thousands who for years have been posting their hostilities online. In the brief 
time since I started writing this article, several dozen angry tweets have been written, including this one, which I 
rather like: "That £50-100 difference between Ryanair and BA is taken not from your wallet, but from your soul."
Forget big data, feedback is best given face-to-face
Such stuff is both endless and up there for the world to see, and yet turns out to be easier for executives to ignore 
than half a dozen cross customers they meet in person.
You might have expected that, as the virtual world has grown and data proliferated, the value of the real encounters 
would have shrunk, but the reverse seems to be happening. The more bewildering the virtual world, the more we 
fall back on "real" evidence, no matter how subjective, presented by strangers under our own noses.
It is not just Mr O'Leary who puts disproportionate weight on chance meetings while he is eating his supper. 
Richard Dawkins recently told The Times that he realised atheists such as him had won the battle over God 
because at the dinner parties he goes to he no longer meets anyone religious. When even scientists trust the 
anecdotal evidence of the dinner party more than data, you know something pretty fundamental has happened.
Just now I bumped into a fellow columnist. I was about to explain to him my theory about the inflated trust we place 
in face-to-face encounters but before I could open my mouth he started boasting. He told me he had just got back 
from the US where he had been stopped twice by perfect strangers, once in a bookshop and once in an airport, 
both of whom told him they loved his writing. There was no need for me to ask his view of my theory: he was 
providing me with living proof of it. This man gets a vast amount of adulation on email and Twitter, but by 
comparison to the real thing, they do not touch him at all.
Yet if praise delivered in person by strangers is powerful, criticism delivered in the same way is even more so. I can 
remember exactly the dinner party I went to about 15 years ago, when a fellow guest who I had never met before 
looked me in the eye and said that she thought my columns were fatuous. I can remember the food, what I was 
wearing - everything.
This sort of thing is memorable partly because it is so unusual. Most people do not relish being nasty in person: we 
have all been brought up to be polite to strangers, especially if we are breaking bread with them.
By contrast, on the internet our upbringing is non-existent. No one seems to think there is anything wrong with 
being gratuitously horrible - so long as we cannot be seen. So the dinner party/McDonald's test may not be 
unscientific after all. The person who approaches an off-duty chief executive to complain is not just another internet 
troll. They are someone who really means it and really wants an answer.
The executive is then put on the spot, in a way that almost never happens in the course of a normal day in the 
office. At a dinner party or at McDonald's there is no PR person at hand to draft a sanitised reply. There are no 
underlings to delegate the tricky question to. There is no time to think it through: a convincing answer needs to be 
given in public, then and there.
This means that the test set by the angry fellow diner is invaluable. If the chief executive cannot muster a good 
defence, then it suggests that Mr O'Leary's response is the only honourable one. A U-turn is signalled.

Dear Michael O'Leary,
I see you have decided, in your own inimitably abrupt fashion, to shed Ryanair's reputation for being abrupt. Forgive 
me for being a little sceptical about your ability to do so.
It sounds good. Ryanair has become notorious for treating customers like idiots, and making many of us feeling 
even more idiotic for having once again flown with the budget airline.
"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," you said last week, this unexpected show of 
humility coming after shareholders at your annual meeting suggested that Ryanair's abrasive attitude towards 
customers was starting to affect sales. You went on to outline some fancy new digital marketing initiatives you 
hoped might help.
Noting that one of your new strategies was to start a Ryanair Twitter account, I went to have a look.
Immediately, I was pissed off. But, since you have decided to *stop unnecessarily pissing people off*, I can only 
assume it was somehow felt essential to use a picture of lovely girls in bikinis on the airline's Twitter profile.
There remains, it seems, a gaping gulf between what you regard as acceptable and how the rest of us view such 
matters.
This image wasn't even the only annoying thing about your Twitter account. Your company also declared, in one of 
its first tweets, that it wouldn't respond to customers on Twitter. Because it has too many to manage, it said.
Mr O'Leary, you will have to try harder. Even the much-derided banks talk to their customers on Twitter. The point 
of Twitter is that there's a conversation.
Off Message
And then there is your press department. A day after your declaration that Ryanair was going to show its caring 
side, it produced a characteristically scathing response to a survey that declared Ryanair to be the worst of Britain's 
100 biggest brands by readers of consumer magazine Which?.
Ryanair said its own survey of three million customers had turned up only two people who had heard of Which?, the 
consumer magazine that carried out the survey. It went on to suggest that a chunk of the respondents to the 
Which? survey must have been hamsters or gerbils.
This reaction did little to dispel the findings of the accuracy of the original survey, which said Ryanair staff were rude 
and unpleasant and, in some cases, aggressive. Customers, they said, were routinely treated as a nuisance. Staff 
didn't know enough to respond properly to questions.
Are you starting to see why we're not convinced by your *volte face*?
Look, we understand what's happening here. This year, Ryanair has, for the first time anyone can remember, 
issued that horror-of-all-horrors in business terms: a profit warning. Trading conditions are getting difficult. An airline 
long used to leaving others in its jet trails now finds itself on the back foot, vulnerable and feeling a need to explain 
itself.
The problem is, on what basis do you proceed when your culture is so clearly defined? Your staff are basing their 
actions on 20 years of being told that the way to get ahead was extreme irreverence, macho posturing and by 
saying "Bugger off" to everything from talk of EU regulations, complaints about baggage charges or requests for a 
glass of water.
Such things are not easy to shed.
You know what, Mr O'Leary? We, your customer base, are really okay with certain things.
We don't really mind your cheap-as-chips advertising, navigating your clunky website (though we are happy it's 
being fixed), printing off our tickets, baggage restrictions -- and we can even live with your annoying in-flight 
commercial promotions.
Tougher to handle is your firm's tedious we-couldn't-give-a-rat's-arse-about-anything attitude.
Do you really want to convince me that you've changed? Are you really having a humility moment?
Here's what you do:
First, scrap the anachronistic bikini shots. Yes, I know your argument: it's all just a bit of harmless fun and I am a 
cranky mad dungaree-wearing feminist looper for caring. But here's my argument: bikini shots for me suggest a 
charmless, sexist corporation that I'd rather not give money to.
Next, give your staff some leeway. Even you had to concede that it was unreasonable to charge Muhammad Taufiq 
Al Sattar, the Dublin-based neurosurgeon who had just lost his entire family in a house fire, EUR 188 to change his 
flight.
There are hundreds of such incidents that don't make the papers. Most of us have a Ryanair four-hour delay horror 
story (delays happen, that's okay) where the situation was exacerbated by absent, ill-informed and/or clueless staff. 
Let your employees use their judgment to deal with situations properly.
How's that for terms and conditions?
*Yours in expectation . . .*

A few years ago I was at a wedding in Dublin - an Irish bride and her new English husband. We were all warned to 
be on our best behaviour. The English family were strangers - and silent, socially awkward strangers at that. The 
two families had little in common.
The mother of the bride dreaded the prospect of the contorted small talk that lay ahead. There isn't enough gin in 
the world to tide such a mother over safely on a big day out. "I mean, what do you talk to these people about?" she 
complained. "Ryanair of course," whispered the bridesmaid confidently.
Within seconds, the shy and reticent were suddenly chatty storytellers, trading diabolical stories of unspeakable 
public degradation. Ice broken. Job done. You can count on Ryanair - the international code word for consumer 
trauma - to spice up any uncomfortable social occasion. Booze does the rest.
Previous generations had their war stories; the Blitz and food rationing in England, 1916 and the General Post 
Office in Ireland - these are examples of the common ties that bind that are readily understood by all. Our 
generation has Ryanair.
Everyone has a story. My own personal favourites involve the stand-offs at the departure desks between outraged, 
sweating travellers and stern and surly flight attendants, as customers try to cram their beloved possessions into 
the narrow cages used by Ryanair to decide whether a piece of luggage is too big to be carried into the cabin.
The misery of a Ryanair flight is a common tie that binds
So why did the company's normally uncompromising and abrasive chief executive Michael O'Leary suddenly 
announce a kinder Ryanair? The company wants to make the experience a little more pleasant to attract business 
customers. What has happened to the man who urged staff to steal pens from hotels to keep down costs? Is Mick 
taking the Mick?
After all Ryanair will carry 81m of us this year, dwarfing British Airway's 28m and comfortably ahead of Lufthansa's 
60m. The Irish airline makes just over EUR7 profit per passenger and is sitting on a cash pile of EUR3.5bn at a time 
when other carriers are stretched. It flies to 171 airports across Europe and has just done a deal with Stansted to 
deliver an extra 7m passengers to the airport over the next six years.
Earlier this year, Ryanair ordered 175 aircraft from Boeing, which should have retailed for $16bn, but industry 
sources indicate that Mr O'Leary might have got them for half - ruthlessly sensing Boeing's difficulties and 
understanding the potency of his own firepower.
Such chutzpah is not the work of a man worried about the future. This type of audacity indicates that the Ryanair 
model is not broken. If it is not broken, why fix it? For years, the company's approach has been "cheap is enough". 
Management believes that people do not fly to destinations but fly at a price. By offering a price low enough, it will 
generate demand for a city or a country where there was previously no demand. If you have ever seen Geordies on 
stag nights in obscure towns of the Italian Alps, you will agree Ryanair has a point.
The management's view that people will put up with no end of hassle if the price is right was best exemplified by Mr 
O'Leary's blunt retort to passengers who complained that they did not even get a cup of tea during a delay. "You 
only paid a fiver, buy your own tea." Charming.
So why did brusque, "in your face" Mick turn into the luvvie-duvvie, soft, cuddly and caring Michael last week? The 
reason might be in the numbers. Ryanair's recent figures have been disappointing. Yields are down, prices are 
lower and demand is soft. Shaky numbers that might have been attributed to weak sterling and the warm summer 
have continued into September.
Ryanair is worried. Could there be a limit to our tolerance of casual slights, hidden charges and a website that looks 
as if it is trying to hawk everything that has just fallen off the back of every lorry in east London? Could passengers 
be saying "enough"? The stories may be funny in retrospect but perhaps we could not be bothered with the ritual 
humiliation to save 30 quid?
The interesting thing about Mr O'Leary is that he does change his mind. The most significant example of this was 
over the internet. When I first interviewed him in 1999-2000, he was a web sceptic. However, once he saw the 
power of the net, he changed his mind and embraced it more enthusiastically than many competitors.
Maybe his Pauline conversion is real. After all, he has mellowed in recent years. Could it be something to do with 
having four children under the age of eight?
Described by those close to him as "sometimes in error, never in doubt", it is clear that if he has decided that it is 
profitable to be nice, Ryanair will be nice. Quite what a nice Ryanair might look like is anyone's guess. Free 
shoulder massages? Copies of the FT being handed out by smiling representatives at Stansted, urging us all to 
"have a great day"? It is difficult to imagine. But something has clicked inside the head of the most successful chief 
executive in the airline business.
If it leads to a change in the Ryanair experience for 80-odd million of us, how are you going to break the ice with an 
interminable bore the next time you are stuck with one at social gatherings? You never know, we might miss the old 
Ryanair. Be careful what you wish for.

Highlight: Rival easyJet steals march on sector
Irish airline buys 175 Boeings
Body
Ryanair is to introduce measures aimed at attracting more business travellers, after admitting that it has let rival 
easyJet steal a march in the European corporate market.
Yesterday, the Irish airline - Europe's largest low cost carrier by revenue - took the first of these steps by allowing 
business customers to purchase flights with an American Express card.
Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief executive since 2010, has made a priority of attracting more business travellers to 
the UK budget airline. Last year, 10m such passengers flew with easyJet, or 20 per cent of the customer base.
However, Ryanair is seeking to catch up with easyJet's innovation in the corporate market, and is buying 175 
Boeing passenger jets in an attempt to boost its total passenger numbers from 79.3m in 2012-13 to 110m by 2018-
19.
Howard Millar, Ryanair's finance director, said the airline was considering several new facilities to help business 
travellers, such as fast-tracking through airport security before their flights - although he added that this could incur 
an additional charge.
Ryanair woos business customers; TRAVEL & LEISURE
Mr Millar said about 20 to 25 per cent of Ryanair's passengers were business travellers, but admitted that easyJet 
had done more to woo the corporate market.
"EasyJet has stolen a significant march on us," he said. "They are probably two years ahead of where we are in 
terms of their product development . . . we are starting behind but you will find we will catch up that ground rather 
quickly." Mr Millar said that Ryanair had not invested enough in its website or mobile phone applications, and 
claimed that a planned overhaul should appeal to business travellers. Among the improvements the airline is 
considering is a website registration process that can speed up flight booking, and the ability to download boarding 
passes on to a smartphone.
Mr Millar insisted that Ryanair had the potential to secure more business travellers even though it does not fly to 
Europe's four main hubs: Heathrow in London, Charles de Gaulle in Paris, Schiphol in Amsterdam and Frankfurt 
airport.
Instead, the airline focuses on small and medium sized airports, which Mr Millar argued did not suffer from 
congestion - unlike the large hubs.
By contrast, easyJet's strategy in the corporate market has been to fly to major airports including Charles de Gaulle 
and Schiphol - although it does not operate at Heathrow or Frankfurt.
Both Ryanair and easyJet are pitching for more business travellers by poaching them from flag carrier groups 
including Air France-KLM, International Airlines Group and Lufthansa - some of which have lossmaking short-haul 
operations.

Ryanair has made amends with American Express, yesterday announcing it will start accepting payments more 
than a decade after banning the cards for "excessive charges". The budget airline said the change of heart is part of 
its drive to attract more business passengers, which has already seen the carrier introduce some reserved seats. 
Ryanair also pledged to make its booking app free from 1 October - having previously charged customers

RYANAIR, the discount airline that people love to hate, has promised to transform its "macho and abrupt culture" 
and turn over a new leaf as a more friendly and customer-focused business.
The new strategy will include an overhaul of its website, a new team to respond to emails and a pledge to stop 
fining customers for carry-on bags that are barely over the size restriction. Plus, it is now on Twitter - @Ryanair.
The change in direction comes amid shareholder concerns that the company's reputation for shabby service is 
limiting its capacity for growth.
But how hard will it be for Ryanair to get consumers to view it more positively? Using YouGov BrandIndex, we can 
measure the brand's performance in Europe's three largest markets: Germany, the UK and France.
Looking at Ryanair's overall Index scores (a composite of six key measures of brand health) we see that the brand 
has the most work to do in Britain, where it has an Index score of minus 40.8.
It is much better off in Germany (minus 14.5) and France (minus 6.4), but in all three markets it is not a case of 
where Ryanair is most liked, but rather where it is least disliked.
Ryanair competitor EasyJet beats it by 40 points in the UK, 12 points in Germany and eight points in France.
But when we look at the Consideration metric, which asks consumers which brands they are considering 
purchasing, it is a far sunnier picture for Ryanair, and helps explain why it is Europe's second largest airline after 
Lufthansa.
Ryanair charm offensive may heal its brand reputation BRAND INDEX
Brits are more likely than their Franco-German neighbours to say they're thinking of flying Ryanair, with a score of 
13.4, followed by Germany (7.4) and France (4.8) - although even on this measure, EasyJet comes much higher in 
the UK, with a score of 34.
Nonetheless, while many consumers across Europe have a pretty dim view of Ryanair, that does not put them off 
taking advantage of its low prices.
Our research suggests that if the company were to succeed in improving its customer service (and therefore how 
consumers regard the brand), it could build upon its market position and take its already formidable success to new 
heights. But in the meantime, it has a lot of work to do.

In some ways winning can be almost as bad as losing. When companies become very successful, they frequently 
fall prey to a variety of diseases. These undermine the very reasons why a business achieved success in the first 
place.
For example, hugely profitable businesses tend to allow bureaucracy to proliferate like a virus. And it does not just 
increase expense; it inhibits change and becomes an end in itself.
General Motors was the world's biggest carmaker for decades. It had huge market share which enabled it to enjoy 
massive margins and vast cash flow thanks to rising demand. So layer after layer of management crept into the 
system, all justifying their existence and adding to cost and inflexibility. Only after bankruptcy has the carmaker truly 
started to become lean . Time will tell if the culture has changed sufficiently to permit GM to prosper in the long run.
Dominant companies often think they can exploit customers, and sometimes even forget them. Monopolistic 
transport providers - national airlines and rail operators, for example - typically get captured by managers and staff, 
and almost ignore passenger welfare. The only consistently profitable and growing airlines in the world are low-cost, 
disruptive models such as Ryanair, easyJet and Southwest. Despite all their apparent advantages, national carriers 
generally cannot compete economically against such efficient, entrepreneurial rivals. The same logic holds for any 
industry.
Corporate beasts are their own enemy
Massive profitability can be a dangerous addiction. Organisations become habituated to such conditions and fail to 
realise that their returns are excessive and unsustainable.
Two leaders of British industry, GlaxoSmithKline, the drugs company, and BP, the energy group, have been 
battered in recent years by US regulators . Both have suffered enormous financial and reputational damage, 
allegedly because they took inappropriate risks or broke rules. They are not alone, of course. Both of these 
industries have enjoyed super margins and returns for many years, which can breed arrogance and complacency. 
But the era of exceptional profits may well be over.
Hollywood has over-rewarded its bosses and stars grotesquely, and allowed unions to ramp up costs, because it 
has made so much money from DVDs. But that cash well is drying up, and on-demand video will not prove such a 
gusher.
The studios are scrambling, hoping international sales, special effects and endless sequels will solve their 
challenges. But onscreen creativity is at a low ebb, and I predict the sector will suffer in the coming years.
Triumph in one segment can lead executives into delusions of grandeur, and a belief that they can run anything 
brilliantly. EMI was the world's leading recorded music business: but the board squandered its fantastic cash flows 
and catalogues in a myriad of other activities through mergers and acquisitions, from CAT scanners to microchips 
to domestic appliances to television rental.
Rather than concentrating on a core competence, management teams spoilt with a great business can become 
bored and self-indulgent, leading to diversifications which destroy value.
A related sickness is the well-known edifice complex, where tycoons build monuments to themselves. A classic 
example was the 50-storey headquarters of Enron, an oval glass tower in downtown Houston. After Enron's 
bankruptcy, the building was sold for about a fifth of its previous valuation.
Office politics is a syndrome which afflicts all organisations: it tends to be worst in those which have highly lucrative 
franchises, because they can afford such decadence.
Perhaps the finest expose of how harmful it can be was described by Dick Brass, a former Microsoft vice-president, 
in a New York Times article in 2010. He explained how the technology group could have launched a tablet device 
10 years before Apple but internecine warfare killed the project. Other, established divisions within Microsoft 
resented the diversion of resources and so sabotaged the innovation.
Taking customers for granted, bureaucracy, office politics, wasteful diversification, management self-indulgence 
and greed, regulatory complacency - the many perils of success mean no companies stay great for ever.

International investors are bullish about European stocks in 2013 according to recent reports, and Irish companies 
are among the biggest beneficiaries.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch last week said that stock sell-offs in emerging markets were driving European 
equities back to pre-crisis levels, with allocations to eurozone stocks reaching their highest level since May 2007.
"A net 36 per cent of global asset allocators are overweight in the region, more than twice the net 17 per cent 
recorded in August," the report stated.
The news follows on the heels of a Goldman Sachs report from earlier this month which stated that US investors 
had put more money into European equities over the course of the first six months of 2013 than they had since 
1977. US institutions had pumped in $65 billion, the report said.
According to Davy, a significant amount of those international funds went to Irish stocks, driving the market up 16 
per cent in the first half of 2013. The Iseq index of Irish shares outperformed a number of the other key European 
indices in the same period, including the FTSE 100, which was up 5 per cent; Germany's Dax, which was up 4.5 
per cent and France's CAC, which was up 2.6 per cent.
Davy pointed out that the individual Irish stocks that outperformed in the first half -- such as recruitment company 
CPL, insurance firm FBD, Bank of Ireland, Grafton Group and ICG -- were "equity stories built around Irish 
economic recovery, a theme that has resonated with international investors this year".
Ryanair, despite a major share price decline since early September, also attracted increased international investor 
funds this year. Davy said that "Smurfit Kappa Group has also seen overseas demand as legacy private equity 
holders finally exited the stock in January of this year and its shares [benefited] from better European growth 
dynamics".
Equities: Global investors optimistic about European stocks
Meanwhile, Green REIT, a real estate investment trust launched by Davy in July, raised EUR 310 million in equity -- 
the maximum amount sought after initially marketing a fund raising of EUR 200 million. The majority of the 
institutional demand came from US and British-based investors keen to get exposure to the Irish real estate 
recovery.

It has been a humbling few weeks for brash Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his bid to soften the airline's image 
will be welcomed by shareholders. Comments by the Ryanair chief executive at the airline's agm last Friday 
suggest a fundamental reappraisal of the airline's culture is under way.
Earlier this month, Ryanair shares slumped by as much as 15 per cent, its biggest tumble in more than two years, 
after it said full-year profits would be at the lower end of its forecast range.
That came close on the heels of a ruling by the British Competition Commission said that Ryanair must sell down its 
Aer Lingus stake. To some analysts, Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus was always dismissed as a distraction from the 
airline's key priority of winning ever more passengers from its competitors.
While O'Leary is rightfully lauded as the main driver behind the airline's massive growth and ruthless focus on 
costs, that has come at a price.
His brash personality and apparent lack of interest in customer service is also seen as a major contributor to a less-
than-friendly image.
A survey by consumer magazine Which? published earlier this month gave Ryanair the lowest score out of 100 
major brands.
As the airline heads into a bloody price war with its competitors following the recent profit warning, it may finally 
have decided that it cannot afford to alienate large numbers of potential customers.
"I'm conscious that we need to eliminate a lot of minor things that irritate," O'Leary told investors at the agm.
"We do need to soften the image when things go wrong. We need to be quicker and more responsive."
This was the closest O'Leary has ever come to sounding humble. And there was more.
Newsmaker: Michael O'Leary
"I'm happy to take the blame if we have an overly macho culture," he said.
"There is a large slug of potential customers who we need to attract to try Ryanair."
But it would be unwise to read the change of tack as any lessening of O'Leary's focus on furthering Ryanair's 
dominant position in European aviation.
More significant than his stated ambitions to develop a more cuddly image, was the announcement earlier in the 
week that the airline had struck a ten-year deal with Stansted Airport.
That will see its traffic grow at the London airport by over 50 per cent, from 13.2 million passengers in 2012 to over 
20 million.
It will provide for up to 25 per cent of the backbone for Ryanair's continuing phenomenal growth story between now 
and the end of the decade.
Securing a package of lower costs and more efficient facilities at Stansted, Ryanair's main base of operations, 
means that many of the aircraft to be delivered under its recent huge Boeing order can slot in to a proven strategy 
at a proven hub.
Expansion into Israel, north Africa and perhaps even the US may also be part of the plan.
If O'Leary can deliver on his promised level of growth, investors will care little if he takes a "cheap and cheerful" or a 
"cheap and nasty" approach.
O'Leary has proved adept at using innovative tactics to attract ever more passengers. Turning on the charm is just 
one more step in the process.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, says he is not a regular on the dinner party circuit, but the abuse he 
receives about his airline's customer service when he dines at McDonald's with his children is getting to him.
In an apparent U-turn for Mr O'Leary - noted for his tirades against competitors, regulators and ministers - he has 
pledged to soften Ryanair's image and overhaul customer relations.
"We should try and eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," said Mr O'Leary at an annual general 
meeting yesterday, where he faced tough criticism from shareholders about Ryanair's "macho" culture and poor 
customer relations.
Mr O'Leary said the airline was revamping its website to make it more user-friendly, improving the way it 
communicated with customers and amending policies that irritated.
He said Ryanair needed to be more responsive to customers, and accepted some blame for the company's poor 
media image.
"I'm very happy to take the responsibility if we have a macho or overly abrupt culture. Some of that may well be my 
own personality deformities," he said. "I don't go to dinner parties, but when I'm sitting in McDonald's with the kids I 
get the exact same amount of abuse as some of our wealthy shareholders at their dinner parties."
O'Leary promises to soften Ryanair 's image TRAVEL & LEISURE
A stronger focus on customer service would amount to a shift in strategy for Ryanair, which has achieved rapid 
growth by providing flights with minimal frills at low cost. It follows a profit warning by Ryanair this month and media 
coverage about customer service.
This week the airline was voted worst of the 100 biggest brands in the UK market in customer relations by readers 
of consumer magazine Which?
Mr O'Leary made his comments in response to shareholders, who asked whether the airline's "macho" culture and 
strict customer service policies were deterring customers.
"I've seen people crying at boarding gates," said one investor, who warned that the airline's harsh policies damaged 
its image. "I have a feeling that in the past the non-executive directors have not done enough to bring to heel the 
macho culture in the company."
Another shareholder bemoaned the bad publicity Ryanair and Mr O'Leary tended to attract.
"Your image has been responsible for the vast bulk of success of this company. But has it not gone too far in 
apparently trying to bully?" asked the man, who said he was the only member of his family who would choose to fly 
Ryanair.

Highlight: ENRC is Footsie's 'least effective user'
Four followers for group, says report
Body
For ENRC, it is the final insult. The Kazakh mining company , which is due to be dropped from the FTSE 100 on 
Monday, has been identified as the index's least effective user of Twitter. "Overall, ENRC plc is quite possibly the 
company that is most out of touch with social media," said a report from communications group Battenhall.
The report identified two Twitter accounts bearing the name of the ENRC, one of which had tweeted 861 times 
since last July. Yet the account, @news_enrc, has attracted just four followers - fewer than some other FTSE 100 
companies that have never tweeted.
ENRC declined to comment on whether the accounts were official. The ranking comes as a growing number of 
listed businesses experiment with Twitter to post news and deal with customer comments.
Ryanair began tweeting this week, joining at least 90 FTSE 100 companies that are present on the site.
Paul Armstrong, founder of Digital Orange Consulting, said: "A lot of companies seem to prefer it to other social 
networks.
Kazakh miner @ a loss over tweets
"The linear interface means it is easier to get up and running. For Facebook, you need to have more people running 
your account."
The hazards of Twitter were exposed in January, when managers at music chain HMV omitted to take control of the 
company's accounts before announcing redundancies.
Staff then used the accounts to post messages of outrage at their dismissal.
But Twitter's informality appears to have come naturally to Ryanair, which used the site to respond to criticism by 
consumer publication Which? .
"Just two #Ryanair passengers out of 3m surveyed have ever heard of Which magazine . . . but neither of them 
have read it," the company tweeted.
Its rival easyJet has taken a more subtle approach, retweeting dozens of favourable customer messages but being 
slower to respond to complaints, such as "Dear @easyJet, please can you find my canoe which went to Bristol 
instead of Stansted last night. I have the world championships soon."
Meanwhile, companies without natural popular appeal are trying to make the most of Twitter through sheer 
enthusiasm.
"Did you know [we] have produced more than 100,000 gas turbine rotating parts?" Aberdeen's Wood Group 
rhetorically enquired of its 1,805 followers this month.
The most popular FTSE 100 Twitter account belongs to luxury goods brand Burberry, which has 2.2m followers, 
eight times more than second placed ITV.
The quantity of followers is a blunt measure of online success. "If you're an oil and gas company and you have the 
right 25 people following you, that could be worthwhile," said Mr Armstrong.
The FTSE 100 companies without Twitter accounts include BHP Billiton and Aberdeen Asset Management.

Euston backed for HS2 as mayor steps in

Body
The government has insisted Euston will remain the southern terminus of its proposed high-speed rail link between 
London and the north after Boris Johnson, the capital's mayor, threatened to withdraw support if the line stopped 
short of the city centre.
Mr Johnson's intervention came after Lord Deighton, the Treasury minister leading a task force scrutinising the HS2 
project, signalled that he would consider scrapping the most expensive last few miles of the proposed route .
That would leave trains terminating at Old Oak Common in northwest London, currently designed as an interchange 
between HS2 and the capital's new east-west Crossrail line .
Peter Hendy, the mayor's transport commissioner and head of Transport for London, said: "The mayor will support 
HS2 but it would be conditional on the line terminating in central London."
Mr Hendy said Crossrail was designed to "cope with London's growing population and support further economic 
development" and said that would be "stymied by people being dumped off high-speed services in the middle of 
nowhere in west London".
The latest twist to the HS2 debate comes as ministers fight back against growing criticism of the scheme following 
their admission that the cost could top £50bn, including rolling stock.
Euston backed for HS2 as mayor steps in
Cabinet ministers, including David Cameron and George Osborne, have promised to bear down on costs and make 
a better economic case for the project.
Lord Deighton, a former Goldman Sachs banker and one of the top executives behind the London 2012 Olympic 
Games, has been put at the forefront of the project. When asked by the FT this week if his mandate included 
looking at scrapping the expensive stretch into Euston, Lord Deighton said: "Looking at opportunities to do things 
more efficiently is something we are prepared to consider."
Yesterday, the Treasury said: "It is absolutely right that Lord Deighton looks at how costs can be controlled and how 
we manage the project - that is what he was referring to. It remains the case that HS2 will go into Euston and that 
will be spelt out in [legislation]".
Mr Johnson officially backs HS2 but predicted in July that the cost would exceed £70bn.
The government does not separate out the cost of the last few miles of the route, which is all through tunnel, or the 
redevelopment of Euston station, but estimates range from £1bn to as much as £5bn.
Mr Johnson has previously warned against terminating the trains at Old Oak Common dubbing it "the Ryanair 
solution", in a reference to the airline's use of airports at a distance from destinations.
 International comparisons 
UK: Government could be waiting years to recoup its investment in big lenders
This week's sale of the first tranche of government-owned Lloyds shares came five years to the day after the bank 
made the disastrous acquisition of HBOS, which set it hurtling towards a £21bn government rescue.
The reality is that it could take another decade for the government to claw back the £130bn it spent bailing out 
Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley during the financial crisis.
The timetable for Lloyds is expected to be faster. The success of this week's transaction - the £3.2bn share sale 
delivered a £61m paper profit and was well oversubscribed - means the Treasury is likely to offload a second, larger 
tranche of Lloyds shares in the first half of 2014. Bankers say the government could potentially exit its now 33 per 
cent stake in Lloyds altogether, at a decent profit for taxpayers, by the end of next year.
That is in contrast to RBS, which is still trading 30 per cent below the price at which the government paid for its 81 
per cent stake. RBS benefited from £45bn of state aid - the world's biggest bailout. Given the uncertainties hanging 
over the bank - the government is considering whether to split it into "good" and "bad" units - it is unlikely that any 
money will be recouped until after the 2015 election.
The government could wait several years to reclaim in full the £37bn and £27bn it pumped into Northern Rock and 
Bradford & Bingley. These rescues were structured differently to Lloyds and RBS, largely through loans rather than 
equity injections.
British taxpayers received £820m from the sale of the "good" part of Northern Rock to Virgin Money in 2011. But the 
vast majority of the funds used to prop up the lender will only be returned once its £36bn mortgage book is repaid. 
Northern Rock's mortgage book was merged with that of B&B and is now managed by UK Asset Resolution. UKAR 
still owes the government £42.1bn, which it expects to take a decade to repay.

US: Biggest were swift to repay Treasury in haste to escape restrictions 
US government investments in the country's biggest banks were repaid in 2009, only months after the emergency 
capital infusions were made.
Euston backed for HS2 as mayor steps in
Anxious to escape restrictions, including caps on pay, that came with the money, banks raised capital privately as 
soon as markets had stabilised to repay the government's investment.
The Treasury invested $245bn from the troubled asset repurchase programme (Tarp) in more than 700 banks and 
has so far recovered more than $270bn.
However, the bulk of the money - most of it invested in the form of preferred stock with a fixed dividend of 5 per cent 
and additional warrants allowing the government to buy common stock - was returned within months.
In 2009, banks perceived as healthy - such as JPMorgan Chase, which took $25bn in government capital in 2008 - 
and even those still seen as potentially in difficulty - such as Bank of America and Citigroup, which each took $45bn 
- repaid the government with interest.
For Citi, the exercise had been particularly humbling as it saw Washington become its biggest shareholder with a 
27 per cent stake.
There are more than 100 much smaller institutions in which the government still had some exposure as of June this 
year, according to the special inspector general for Tarp.
Overall, the Tarp investments are now expected to make a profit.
A more recent feature is a projected profit on the largest, most troublesome bailouts. AIG, the insurer bailed out with 
more than $180bn of loans and guarantees, is now estimated to have returned a profit of $23bn.
The mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together also received more than $180bn, made 
$10bn in net income last quarter and may now end up producing a profit too.

 Eurozone: Only a fraction of money was recouped - and some may be lost forever
Across Europe, the German and Spanish bank bailouts have been mostly costly.
The highestprofile German bank failure was Commerzbank, the country's secondlargest private sector lender, 
which received EUR18.2bn. The government's 25 per cent stake decreased to 17 per cent this year when 
Commerzbank embarked on a EUR2.5bn capital raising but analysts estimate the government has made a loss of 
about 80 per cent to date.
Germany's secondbiggest property lender, Hypo Real Estate, was another casualty - requiring EUR9.95bn of 
capital, EUR145bn of state guarantees and EUR20bn of protection against bad loans.
Meanwhile, Germany's regional, statebacked Landesbanken received EUR21bn of capital, of which only a small 
fraction has been repaid.
The Spanish government has been forced to inject EUR61.37bn into its ailing financial sector - and few believe it 
will ever see much of a return.
Most of the banks that had to be nationalised after 2009 were unlisted local savings banks, or cajas. All but three 
have since been sold on to other Spanish lenders, always for less than the state injected.
Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo (CAM), for example, required a EUR5.25bn bailout in 2011. It was sold to Banco 
Sabadell a few months later for a symbolic EUR1.
In the Netherlands, ABN Amro, the Netherlands' thirdlargest bank, remains fully stateowned, while ING, the second 
largest, owes EUR3.375bn in principal and interest on its EUR10bn rescue in 2009.
In February, the government spent EUR3.7bn nationalising the country's fourthlargest bank, SNS Reaal.
Euston backed for HS2 as mayor steps in
In Belgium, KBC has repaid more than half the EUR7bn of fresh capital it received and the government raised 
EUR6.7bn from sale of bad assets of Fortis to Lone Star, the distressed asset fund, this year.

Sharp-edged Ryanair admits it has an image problem
Sharp-edged Ryanair admits it has an image problem

Ryanair may finally have gotten the message: Customers like the European airline's cheap ticket prices and huge 
selection of destinations, but loathe how they're treated from start to finish.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told shareholders Friday his airline must improve how it treats passengers 
and handles complaints so that customers don't feel pushed around by staff and unfairly imposed charges and 
potentially take business to other airlines offering more than Ryanair's budget model.
"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," O'Leary told shareholders at their annual 
general meeting, during which Ryanair's chief faced questions on why the airline seemingly went out of its way to 
be rude and dismissive of criticism. Ryanair did not permit TV cameras into the conference room.
O'Leary's concession came one day after Britain's premier consumer magazine, Which?, published a survey of 
more than 3,300 readers that placed Ryanair dead last among 100 top brands in quality of customer service.
Ryanair, typically, ridiculed the criticism in its official response Thursday, claiming to have surveyed 3 million 
customers and finding that only one had ever read Which? magazine.
But O'Leary sounded a more thoughtful note to investors and reporters as he fielded complaints that Ryanair under 
his leadership was tone-deaf to legitimate criticism. He arrived to headlines of how Ryanair this week had charged a 
Dublin doctor 188 euros ($255) to reschedule his flight to England a change made because his wife and three 
children had just died in a house fire there.
"The staff were implementing our policy but you have to make exceptions in cases like that," O'Leary said, noting 
that Ryanair had refunded "the money that we regret having taken from him in such tragic circumstances."
Ryanair has grown from a single Ireland-England service in 1985 to the biggest short-haul airline in Europe today, 
carrying more than 80 million customers annually. It has performed better than any other airline through Europe's 
long recession as customers seek the lowest possible prices despite Ryanair's reputation for sharp practice.
But as other airlines adjust to compete on price, Ryanair's weaknesses are standing out in some consumers' minds.
Sharp-edged Ryanair admits it has an image problem
O'Leary said Ryanair planned in the coming year to improve its website because it was harder to use than the site 
of easyJet, its biggest budget rival. He said Ryanair would create a communications unit that responds to customer 
complaints "hopefully quickly" using Twitter and telephone texts.
And he said Ryanair would review its inflexible enforcement of rules that, if violated, trigger punitive charges on 
customers. Money-making mistakes include not preprinting your own boarding card, arriving with a bag that 
exceeds Ryanair's weight or size rules, or needing to reschedule a booking regardless of the reason.
"Some of our policies are implemented with a degree of robustness that isn't warranted," he told reporters. 
"Somebody who shows up with a bag 1 millimeter bigger than the (official) baggage size (limit) as long as it fits in 
the baggage sizer, it goes on."
"We do need to improve and to soften some of the harder edges in our service and in our image," he said.

Shareholders at its AGM in Dublin were told that it plans to launch the @Ryanair Twitter page and remove the 
Recaptcha security feature for individual passengers from 30 Oct next (Recaptcha will remain in place for high 
volume bookers, screenscrapers, travel agents etc.).
Ryanair's mobile app will from Tues 1 Oct be downloadable free of charge (previously E3) and a booking flow 
redesign will go live in December.
Passenger registration/retention services will go live for summer 2014, substantially reducing the time it takes to 
complete bookings. "Our primary focus this winter will be to significantly invest in, and improve, the Ryanair.com 
website, our mobile platform and our interaction with passengers using social media," chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said. "We are pleased to remove Recaptcha from November for individual passengers, although the 
security feature will remain in place for high volume or multiple IP addresses in order to deter larger travel agents, 
screenscrapers and others who flood our website seeking fare quotes, and diminish our website's accessibility for

The ISEQ rose - though modestly - this morning for the third straight day as global investors continued to benefit 
from the US Fed's hold policy on economic stimulus.
By 12:45, the index was up 7.17 points to 4,299.71.
World shares steadied at a five-year high and bond and commodity markets were consolidating a week of major 
gains after the U.S. Federal Reserve's shock decision to keep its flow of stimulus steady. After the sharp moves of 
Wednesday and Thursday, Asian and early European trading was largely subdued as investors took stock of their 
positions and locked in some of the gains, with half an eye on German elections on Sunday.
Yesterday's Irish GDP data show a welcome 0.4pc rise in Q2 2013 following the 0.6pc contraction in Q1 2013. GDP 
is still down 1.2pc on the year. The rebound in Q2 was driven by consumer spending up 0.7pc and exports up 
4.5pc. Investment spending fell by 3.4pc in Q2 2013 following a 6.4pc contraction in Q1. However, excluding the 
volatile aircraft leasing sector, investment spending is up by 11.8pc, with building and construction rising by 11.3pc. 
"Although we will probably revise our forecasts for calendar year GDP growth in 2013 below 1pc, we still believe 
that activity will rebound in H2. Hence, we are unlikely to substantially revise our forecast 2.1pc GDP growth in 
2014," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair were flat at E6.30 after it promised to transform its "abrupt culture" in a bid to 
win customers from costlier rivals, admitting for the first time that it had a significant problem with customer service. 
The Irish airline, this week voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by readers of 
consumer magazine Which, said it would become more lenient on fining customers over bag sizes and overhaul the 
way it communicates. "We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary told the company's annual general meeting after several shareholders complained about the 
impact of customer service on sales.

The ISEQ rose - though modestly - this morning for the third straight day as global investors continued to benefit 
from the US Fed's hold policy on economic stimulus.
By 12:45, the index was up 7.17 points to 4,299.71.
World shares steadied at a five-year high and bond and commodity markets were consolidating a week of major 
gains after the U.S. Federal Reserve's shock decision to keep its flow of stimulus steady. After the sharp moves of 
Wednesday and Thursday, Asian and early European trading was largely subdued as investors took stock of their 
positions and locked in some of the gains, with half an eye on German elections on Sunday.
Yesterday's Irish GDP data show a welcome 0.4pc rise in Q2 2013 following the 0.6pc contraction in Q1 2013. GDP 
is still down 1.2pc on the year. The rebound in Q2 was driven by consumer spending up 0.7pc and exports up 
4.5pc. Investment spending fell by 3.4pc in Q2 2013 following a 6.4pc contraction in Q1. However, excluding the 
volatile aircraft leasing sector, investment spending is up by 11.8pc, with building and construction rising by 11.3pc. 
"Although we will probably revise our forecasts for calendar year GDP growth in 2013 below 1pc, we still believe 
that activity will rebound in H2. Hence, we are unlikely to substantially revise our forecast 2.1pc GDP growth in 
2014," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair were flat at E6.30 after it promised to transform its "abrupt culture" in a bid to 
win customers from costlier rivals, admitting for the first time that it had a significant problem with customer service. 
The Irish airline, this week voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by readers of 
consumer magazine Which, said it would become more lenient on fining customers over bag sizes and overhaul the 
way it communicates. "We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off," Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary told the company's annual general meeting after several shareholders complained about the 
impact of customer service on sales.

(RTTNews) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said Friday that it plans to roll out a new 
website and digital marketing strategy after reaching certain milestones.
The company will launch the @Ryanair Twitter page, and remove the Recaptcha security feature for individual 
passengers from 30 October next. The company noted that Recaptcha will remain in place for high volume bookers, 
screenscrapers, travel agents etc.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said, "Our primary focus this winter will be to significantly invest in, and improve, the 
Ryanair.com website, our mobile platform and our interaction with passengers using social media. ..This winter will 
also see a rolling programme of development to improve the Ryanair.com website, make it easier for passengers to 
navigate, quicker for them to locate our all-inclusive price quotes, identify availability of our lower fare promotions 
and book Ryanair's great fares for themselves and their families."
The company added that its new digital marketing strategy will see it switch a significant proportion of its marketing 
budget from old to new media, with a particular focus on mobile and social media platforms.
At its Annual General Meeting in Dublin, the airline briefed shareholders that its mobile app, which was previously 
charged at 3 euros, will be downloadable free of charge from Tuesday, October 1.
It also briefed that booking flow redesign will go live in December. Passenger registration/retention service will be 
live for summer 2014, substantially reducing the time it takes to complete bookings.
Ryanair said it recently achieved milestones, including first EU airline to carry 9 million passengers in a calendar 
month of August, and first EU airline to carry 80 million passengers per annum.
The company noted that its operations set new record highs in the month of August. According to the company, 
94% of flights were on-time, there were less than 1 bag per 3,000 passengers misplaced and less than 1 
cancellation for every 10,000 flights operated.
The company said its traffic is set to grow to 110 million passengers by fiscal 2019.
O'Leary said, "Our recent agreements with Boeing, Warsaw Modlin and London Stansted show that Ryanair 
continues to widen our substantial unit cost advantage over all other EU airlines. We will use these lower costs to

offer even lower fares to Ryanair passengers across all EU markets in which we operate, and already these fares 
(starting from ?15 one way) are delivering increased bookings and higher advance loads, albeit at lower yields this 
autumn."
Ryanair shares are currently trading at 6.29 pence, down 0.06 pence or 0.93 percent.

Highlight: Michael O'Leary says new fare cuts have led to a surge in bookings, writes Andrew Parker
Body
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's maverick chief executive, scoffed this week at the suggestion from some journalists that 
the budget airline's latest profit warning demonstrated that its business model was broken.
At an airline industry conference in London, he bragged that Ryanair's aggressive fare cuts - made in response to 
weakening demand and announced at the September 4 profit warning - had led to a surge in bookings over the 
past two weeks.
Amid some trademark jibes about rival airlines, one sex joke and a willingness to get off the conference platform to 
personally pass the microphone to a female member of the audience because she was blonde, Mr O'Leary said: "I 
always regard profit warnings as a good opportunity to ram out lots more cheap [fares].
"Bookings have spiked up in the last two weeks on the fact of [journalists] writing the latest downturn as Ryanair's 
business model has failed. All we get is a flood more people trying to book Ryanair."
Ryanair, which has its annual meeting tomorrow, blamed the profit warning on several factors beyond the 
company's control, including the hot weather.
Ryanair set on fresh flight path after a 'winter wobble'; News analysis; Travel & Leisure
But some analysts believe the reduced earnings guidance by Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue was at 
least partly selfinduced.
They consider that Ryanair is embarking on fare cuts to keep rival airlines at bay and stop them undermining its 
plans for a new growth phase by buying 175 Boeing passenger jets .
Ryanair is not a regular issuer of profit warnings - analysts regard the latest one as only its third, and relatively mild.
The Irish airline expects full-year net profit to be at the bottom end of its previously stated range of EUR570m to 
EUR600m for 2013/14, meaning earnings could be flat year on year.
Although Ryanair acknowledged the possibility it could miss this reduced target - and its shares fell 11 per cent on 
September 4 - the profit warning was not as severe as its maiden one in 2004. Then, Ryanair's shares dropped 31 
per cent after the airline revealed it expected to miss its profit target for 2003/04 and report a fall in earnings.
This time around, Ryanair began by citing the summer heatwave. Last-minute bookings in July had been at lower 
than expected yields - a measure of average fares paid - partly because some people in northern Europe decided 
not to fly south for beach holidays because of the hot weather at home.
Yields were also reduced by how sterling's value had weakened against the euro during July.
Ryanair reports in euros, but about 25 per cent of its bookings are made in sterling.
However, some of the airline's reasons for a "perceptible dip" in yields for September, October and November were 
on the face of it puzzling.
It suggested that some of this phenomenon was due to weakening demand amid fragile economic conditions, but 
these problems are longstanding, and if anything are showing signs of dissipating.
Several analysts believe Ryanair's yield weakness may be partly explained by its plans to fly more aircraft this 
winter compared to the previous one.
Ryanair proposed grounding only 50 of its 300 aircraft this winter compared with 100 last time around, reflecting the 
way in which several airlines are planning capacity increases because of the green shoots of economic recovery - 
with the risk, however, of depressing ticket prices if supply exceeds demand.
Penelope Butcher, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says: "It would appear that Ryanair's decision to have less 
grounding of aircraft during the winter months has overshot the amount of demand the market can support."
Ryanair has now revised its plans, and will ground up to 80 aircraft this winter.
But the most eye-catching element of Ryanair's response to the profit warning is a decision to extend its EUR14.99 
one-way ticket offer to 1,000 routes - 63 per cent of the total - during October and November.
This aggressive pricing may well stimulate demand, but it could also serve to box in the competition. Some rivals, 
such as Aer Lingus, which issued a profit warning on September 13, have been cutting fares during the summer. 
Others - notably Norwegian Air Shuttle, International Airlines Group's Vueling and Wizz Air - are increasing their 
capacity significantly, in moves that could potentially threaten Ryanair's ability to grow in the coming years, 
particularly after it starts taking delivery of the 175 Boeing aircraft next year.
Donal O'Neill, an analyst at Goodbody, believes that Ryanair is prepared to take an earnings hit now from cutting 
fares to curb the competition, partly because that way it should preserve the case for buying the Boeing aircraft and 
seeking to fly 110m passengers in 2018-19. "Then Ryanair will have real pricing power," he adds.
Ryanair already has considerable pricing power, evidenced by how average fares have risen over the past three 
years, although its prices are usually lower than those of its rivals.
Ryanair set on fresh flight path after a 'winter wobble'; News analysis; Travel & Leisure
All of this underlines that Ryanair's business model, while under pressure, is far from broken.
It will continue to offer cheap headline fares - increasing its revenue significantly through a notorious array of 
ancillary charges that include excess baggage fees - and boasts the leanest cost structure among European 
airlines.
In spite of the profit warning being dubbed Ryanair's "winter wobble" by some analysts, Ryanair remains one of the 
world's most profitable airlines.
As one rival airline executive says: "The end of the world for Ryanair is massively overwritten."

EUROPEAN airlines will have to cut costs at existing short-haul businesses to compete with budget airlines or 
struggle to stay aloft, IAG boss Willie Walsh said yesterday, adding that his firm is not looking for further 
acquisitions in Europe.
So-called legacy carriers such as IAG, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are cutting jobs, renegotiating staff contracts 
and dropping uncompetitive routes to get costs on a par with budget carriers, such as market leaders Ryanair and 
EasyJet.
They are also replacing older, fuelthirsty planes and streamlining backoffice operations.
"We don't see anything attractive to buy or merge with in Europe at the moment. We're focused on reducing out 
cost base and making our short-haul business more efficient ... those that don't will struggle to survive," Walsh said. 
"We have Vueling and I think every airline should aim to have an independent low cost arm."
In current cut-throat market conditions, even some of the budget airlines are finding it tough. Ryanair earlier this 
month warned it could miss its annual profit target.
British Airways previously tried to run a low-cost airline, Go, alongside its mainline carrier but sold it to private equity 
group 3i in 2001.
"There was a lot of management interference in Go and it started cannibalising BA to some extent so we have left 
Vueling as a separate, independent airline," said Walsh.

Air France-KLM is set to announce plans to cut at least another 2,600 jobs today in an admission that weaker-than-
expected revenues this year have left the airline struggling to meet savings targets, writes Michael Stothard .
The restructuring affects the group's French operations, which employ more than 69,000 people. Alongside the 
planned job cuts, are proposals to phase out its costly fleet of Boeing 747 aircraft by 2016 and a review of its 
provincial bases in southern and western France, according to people familiar with the talks.
The fresh cost-cutting measures come as low growth in Europe and high fuel prices have left the airline with more 
to do on top of its existing savings plan , called Transform 2015, which was outlined in 2011 aiming to cut 5,100 
jobs.
The last set of quarterly results revealed   revenues that were below target , with Alexandre de Juniac, the new 
chief executive, adding that the turnround in its medium-haul and cargo businesses was taking longer than 
expected.
Frédéric Gagey, chief executive of the French unit, will call for voluntary redundancies and route closures in the 
short-haul, medium-haul and cargo businesses.
Air France-KLM flags further cuts
Yan Derocles, analyst at Oddo Securities, said the network losses were worse than many rivals. "They have to 
launch this new voluntary departure plan and they have to speed up a little on the wider group restructuring," he 
said.
Air France-KLM is not the only European legacy airline struggling amid competition from lower-cost rivals, such as 
Ryanair   and easyJet.
International Airlines Group, for example, has proposed to cut 22 per cent of the workforce at Iberia while SAS, the 
Scandinavian airline, warned it could go bust unless unions agreed to pay cuts of up to 15 per cent.
Air France established bases in Marseille, Nice and Toulouse less than a year ago, offering lower-cost domestic 
flights as part of a plan to lift its short-haul operations.
But under Mr de Juniac, who has only been CEO of the merged Air France-KLM since July, these operations are 
set to be reviewed, with final decisions to be announced on October 4.
The airline has previously said that "major" measures would include voluntary redundancies as well as "industrial 
and commercial decisions".
Shares in the group fell slightly yesterday. They are up 57 per cent over the past 12 months at EUR7.13.

According to Enterprise Ireland, the new office openings follow extensive research, the completion of successful

target export opportunities in both markets.
Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said that the two markets hold "enormous potential" for 
Irish companies.
"When I travelled to Texas earlier this year for a trade mission with 40 dynamic Irish companies I was blown away 
by the opportunities that exist and the success that some Irish companies have achieved there. Today's 
announcement will mean that Irish companies in these two markets have top-class access to Enterprise Ireland's

exports to the southern states of the USA is "substantial", with the scale of individual southern states the equivalent

According to Enterprise Ireland, the new office openings follow extensive research, the completion of successful 
trade missions and increased client demand, confirming the benefit of these new offices to support Irish companies 
target export opportunities in both markets.
Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said that the two markets hold "enormous potential" for 
Irish companies.
"When I travelled to Texas earlier this year for a trade mission with 40 dynamic Irish companies I was blown away 
by the opportunities that exist and the success that some Irish companies have achieved there. Today's 
announcement will mean that Irish companies in these two markets have top-class access to Enterprise Ireland's

Ireland".According to Enterprise Ireland, the scope of opportunity for Irish companies seeking to expand their 
exports to the southern states of the USA is "substantial", with the scale of individual southern states the equivalent 
of developed economies. Texas is the 15th largest economy in the world and has been identified as a state with a 
high concentration of businesses which represent the best match for the capability of Enterprise Ireland clients.

The ISEQ is lower this morning at 4,264, down 13 points following yesterday's significant rise as European markets 
dipped in early trading on news of further problems for Europe's carmakers and in advance of Fed news.
Davy Stockbrokers looks behind the Ryanair deal at Stanstead:
Ryanair's recent Boeing deal for 175 additional aircraft allows for medium-term growth
from 81m to 110m passengers. In effect, the Stansted deal covers a quarter of that growth. The ten-year deal will 
see Ryanair grow its traffic at Stansted by over 50pc from 13.2m passengers in 2012 to over 20m per annum. In 
year 1 of this ten-year deal, Ryanair will grow from 13.2m to over 14.5m passengers. The Stansted summer 
schedule released yesterday will include 43 based aircraft (up from 37) and four new routes (now 120). This follows 
the announcement of another ten-year commercial agreement with Warsaw Modlin Airport last week. With Stansted 
traffic having fallen from 23.8m to 17.5m passengers, Ryanair (with c.80pc of airport capacity) was clearly key for 
the future growth. New airport owner MAG has existing airport base agreements with Ryanair (Manchester, East 
Midlands, Bournemouth). With traffic declines driven by c.50pc airport cost increases at Stansted since 2007, 
growth of this kind is likely to have come with cost incentives. As Ryanair indicates, the growth to over 20m per 
annum is in return "for a package of lower cost and more efficient facilities". Airport and handling charges are 
estimated at c.14.5pc of costs and 26.7pc of ex-fuel costs in our FY2014 forecasts according to Davy Stockbrokers.

with the sale of £3.3 billion of shares in the bank, marking a momentous turnround in the UK's fortunes after the 
financial crisis. Financial Times: Barclays' legal woes resurfaced when the bank said it was contesting a regulator's 
£50 million fine for acting recklessly by failing to disclose £322 million in fees paid to Qatari investors during its 
emergency cash call five years ago. Financial Times: JP Morgan Chase is in talks to pay at least $800 million to 
settle with securities and bank regulators over the $6 billion London whale trading loss, but faces additional fines 
from US derivatives regulators not part of the current pact, people familiar with the matter said. The Guardian: A 
crucial plan by the Co-operative Group to inject £1.5 billion of capital into its troubled bank is under pressure from 
activist bond holders who are pushing an alternative way of restructuring which would leave them with majority 
ownership. Financial Times: The activist hedge fund TCI has asked the board of EADS to transfer its 4 billion stake 
in Dassault Aviation directly to shareholders as part of its campaign to force the aerospace group to sell the 
politically sensitive asset. 
The Daily Telegraph: Ryanair signalled an era of lower fares at Stansted after striking a 10-year deal with the 
airport's new owners to grow traffic by 50% at its main UK hub to more than 20 million passengers a year; the deal 
is also expected to create 7,000 jobs. Financial Times: Canada's Bombardier on Monday took a key step forward in 
its ambitious plan to challenge the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus in mid-range commercial jets when its C Series 
aircraft took off near Montreal for its delayed maiden flight. Daily Mail: The National Association of Pension Funds 
that represents 1,300 pension schemes with assets of around £900 billion said Babcock, Afren and Inmarsat were 
among ten firms that, having been warned by shareholders last year, saw more than 15% of votes go against their 
remuneration reports in 2013. The Independent: Tesco has become embroiled in another mislabelling scandal after 
the retailer was found selling Dutch pork labelled as British. Business and economics Financial Times: In the end it 
took the opposition of just one senator, Jon Tester, a Democrat from conservative Montana, to tip the balance 
against Lawrence Summers, the White House's choice to be next chair of the Federal Reserve. The Daily 
Telegraph: Mario Draghi has put the European Central Bank on a collision course with Berlin after insisting that 
Europe needs a single authority to wind up failing banks - just two days after Germany said the idea was legally 
questionable. The Guardian: Five years after the financial crisis, America's super-rich have recovered all their 
losses to see their wealth reach an all-time high; according to Forbes magazine the 400 wealthiest Americans are 
worth a record $2.02 trillion, up from $1.7 trillion in 2012. The Daily Telegraph: Anglo American, the FTSE 100 
mining group, has abandoned its copper and gold project in Alaska, resulting in a $300 million hit to its balance 
sheet, as it picks through its portfolio to see which growth projects it wants to keep going. Financial Times: Goldman

It is rare for an index reshuffle to spring many surprises. Yesterday, one caused bedlam, writes Bryce Elder .
London-listed gold miners declined after the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, the most popular sector basket for 
exchange traded funds, excluded all but one of them. African Barrick Gold , Hochschild, Polymetal International 
and Fresnillo were due to be added to the index on Friday, when NYSE lifts a rule that said included stocks had to 
have a US listing. Draft guidance given at the end of August had indicated all four stocks would qualify, according to 
dealers. With the index changes expected to trigger more than $4bn of capital flows, ETF providers had been 
buying ahead of time.
As it turned out, only Centamin qualified, lifting its shares 2.4 per cent to 45.6p. The other four were blocked 
because they were judged to have controlling stakeholders.
But while some brokers had been alerted early to the surprise, there was no public update from NYSE until 2pm 
London time . That left traders blindsided as the sector dropped, with Fresnillo down 12.8 per cent to £10.45 on 
nearly three times the average volume. Hochschild closed off 14 per cent to 237.4p, African Barrick Gold fell 12.4 
per cent to 143.9p and Polymetal slid 7 per cent to 659.5p.
A falling oil price helped lift the wider market, pulling the FTSE 100 up 0.6 per cent or 39.06 points to a six-week 
high of 6,622.86. IAG added 3.3 per cent to 325p and easyJet 2.4 per cent to £13.31. Ryanair took on 4.2 per cent 
Gold miners slide after NYSE index exclusion LONDON
to EUR6.44 after announcing a long-awaited deal with Stansted airport's new owners, MAG, to increase passenger

Barclays was up 1.3 per cent to 305.4p in spite of a warning in its rights issue update that investment bank 
earnings in July and August were "significantly below" the same months of 2012. Nomura was advising clients to 
use any weakness in Barclays as an opportunity to buy.
Shire rose 2.3 per cent to £25.33 following reports that it was looking at a bid for ViroPharma, the $2.6bn-valued 
US drugmaker.
A visit to the DSEI arms fair in London's Docklands last week left Liberum Capital analysts feeling gloomy. They 
advised selling flare maker Chemring , flat at 318p, and moved from "buy" to "hold" on Cobham , off 2.4 per cent 
to 294.1p.
"US budget pressure [and] uncertainty remains a headache for most," said Liberum.

Draft guidance given at the end of August had indicated all four stocks would qualify, according to dealers. With the

Inclusion for Fresnillo would have required them to buy an estimated 29m shares, or 26 times the daily volume.
Demand for Polymetal would have amounted to 14m shares, or 12 days' volume.
As it turned out, only Centamin qualified, lifting its shares 2.4 per cent to 45.6p. The other four were blocked 
because they were judged to have controlling stakeholders.

to EUR6.44 after announcing a long-awaited deal with Stansted airport's new owners, MAG, to increase passenger 
numbers 50 per cent to more than 20m a year.
Cost savings had not been disclosed but are likely to be substantial, given Ryanair already accounts for about four-
fifths of Stansted's capacity, analysts said.
Barclays was up 1.3 per cent to 305.4p in spite of a warning in its rights issue update that investment bank 
earnings in July and August were "significantly below" the same months of 2012. Nomura was advising clients to

Shire rose 2.3 per cent to £25.33 following reports that it was looking at a bid for ViroPharma, the $2.6bn-valued 
US drugmaker.
Shire made sense as a buyer, analysts said, because there was a "nearly a complete overlap in sales and 
marketing" with ViroPharma's lead drug. But Shire was likely to be studying a number of potential targets, they said, 
with Jazz Pharmaceuticals rumoured to be another name on its watch list.
A visit to the DSEI arms fair in London's Docklands last week left Liberum Capital analysts feeling gloomy. They 
advised selling flare maker Chemring , flat at 318p, and moved from "buy" to "hold" on Cobham , off 2.4 per cent

"US budget pressure [and] uncertainty remains a headache for most," said Liberum.
Sirius Minerals , developer of a potash project in the North Yorkshire Moors, fell 19.8 per cent to 9.8p after pushing 
back the target date to gain environmental approval to the third quarter of next year.

The ISEQ's rally stalled this morning as investors took profits and as markets awaited more signals from the US 
Fed on its stimulus policy direction.
By 12:30, the index was down 6.06 points to 4,271.29.
European shares edged lower today, pressured by weakness in carmakers following a fall in demand for autos last 
month, but the market remained close to 5-year highs after a strong rally. Eyes were on the U.S. Federal Reserve 
ahead of a policy meeting expected to confirm a slowing down of its stimulus programme.
Ryanair shares rose 7c to E6.49. Ryanair has concluded a ten-year growth deal at London Stansted with new 
owner Manchester Airport Group (MAG). This will enable it to grow by 50pc from 13.2m passengers per annum to 
over 20m in return for a "package of lower costs and more efficient facilities". This growth would cover circa one-
quarter of the airline's medium-term growth plans for 110m passengers; as such, we view the deal as underpinning 
the group's very substantial growth potential.

Ryanair shares rose 8c to E6.49. Ryanair has concluded a ten-year growth deal at London Stansted with new 
owner Manchester Airport Group (MAG). This will enable it to grow by 50pc from 13.2m passengers per annum to

ryanair restores faith in troubled modlin
airports Budget carrier Ryanair is to switch operations to Warsaw's secondary Modlin airport from 30 September, 
giving the facility a much-needed lift after setbacks over its runway condition and navigation systems. The airport 
re-opened in July after suffering weather disruption last winter, aggravated by the absence of suitable instrument 
landing guidance; new equipment will provide Category I guidance from 19 September.
Hybrid airship gets FAA go-ahead for trials
TeCHNOLOGY The US Federal Aviation Administration has cleared Aeros to operate planned research flights of a 
hybrid, heavy-lift airship designed around a unique ground handling concept that does away with airships' need to 
take on ballast during unloading by pressurising its lighter-than-air gas and replacing the leftover volume with 
heavier oxygen. The 81m (266ft) proof-of-design aircraft - now christened the Aeroscraft Dragon Dream - is a one-
half scale model.

are gearing up to start an updated training syllabus that incorporates more of the jet's advanced avionics. While F-
35 students and instructors at the base currently use the rudimentary Block 1B configuration in their aircraft, later 
this year, the 33rd Fighter Wing will move over to operating the more advanced Block 2A configuration, which will 
enable more realistic tactical training for both air-to-air and air-to-surface missions.

RYANAIR has called a truce with the new owner of Stansted after persuading the airport to cut its fees, in a deal the 
budget airline claims will create 7,000 jobs.
The Irish carrier has agreed a 10-year growth deal with Manchester Airports Group, which bought Stansted in 
January, that will see its traffic through the airport rise by more than 50 per cent to 20m passengers a year.
Ryanair said this growth will create 7,000 jobs over the next five years, on the assumption that 1m passengers per 
year will sustain 1,000 on-site jobs.
"This agreement… proves how UK airports can flourish when released from the dead hand of the BAA monopoly," 
said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair had previously threatened to move flights away from Stansted in protest at the airport charges.
Stansted will only cut its fees after the increases in passenger numbers had been delivered, O'Leary said.
"Today's announcement, coupled with our £80m investment in the terminal, confirms that Ryanair shares our 
confidence," said MAG's chief commercial officer Ken O'Toole in a statement.

Highlight: Tourism Ireland and Minister Leo Varadkar have launched a E19/£15.7 million promotional campaign to 
boost late-season travel to Ireland from around the world during the last few months of The Gathering.
Body
Tourism Ireland and Minister Leo Varadkar have launched a E19/£15.7 million promotional campaign to boost late-
season travel to Ireland from around the world during the last few months of The Gathering.
The September to December period usually yields as much as 30pc of Ireland's overseas tourism business.
The campaign will highlight the many festivals and events taking place right around the island this autumn, many of 
them with a Gathering theme - from the Dublin Festival Season (which includes the Dublin Theatre Festival, Open 
House Dublin and the Bram Stoker Festival), to the Belfast Festival at Queens, Wexford Festival Opera, Westport 
Food Festival, Waterford Harvest Food Festival, Cork Jazz Festival and the Galway International Oyster and 
Seafood Festival. An extra-special focus will be placed on highlighting the New Year's Eve event in Dublin - NYE 
2014 - which is the grand finale of The Gathering and which looks set to be even bigger and better than last New 
Year's event.
The campaign - which is being rolled out in Great Britain, the United States, Mainland Europe, Australia and 
emerging markets - will incorporate a major focus on city breaks as well as on attracting visitors to more rural areas 
over the coming months. Highlights of the activity include co-operative promotions with Aer Lingus and Ryanair, 
transatlantic and long-haul airlines like American Airlines, Etihad and Emirates; cinema, radio, print and online 
advertising; as well as extensive PR and social media activity. Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Leo 
Varadkar said: "It's been a great year for Irish tourism so far with a 6pc increase in visitors. There are still lots of 
great festivals for the Gathering between now and New Year. This E19 million campaign will help keep momentum 
going, and has been fine-tuned for key markets who are likely to visit." Tourism Ireland CEO Niall Gibbons said: 
"Our autumn campaign aims to take advantage of late booking trends in our target markets, as there is still plenty of 
business to play for. Many people are opting for shorter holiday breaks and autumn is a good opportunity with many 
world-class festivals and events happening around the island. In association with our tourism partners, we have 
Tourism Ire in E19m Autumn campaign Tourism Ads
enticing autumn/winter packages to offer, developed around festivals and themes such as food, music, literature

Ryanair and Manchester Airport Group (MAG) today said they had concluded a 10 year growth agreement at 
London Stansted Airport, which will see Ryanair grow its traffic at Stansted by over 50pc.
The deal will see Ryanair traffic rise from 13.2m passengers in 2012 to over 20m a year in return for a package of 
lower costs and more efficient facilities at Stansted.
This agreement will account for up to 25pc of Ryanair's 5 year growth plans to 2019.
Ryanair expects its Stansted traffic in year 1 of this 10-year deal to grow from 13.2m to over 14.5m. The Irish airline 
has today released its Stansted summer 2014 schedule, with a total of 120 routes, including 4 new routes to 
Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat in Morocco. This will feature 43 based aircraft in Stansted (up from 37); 
120 routes (up from 116); 4 new routes to Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat and over 2,000 weekly flights (up 
from 1,800). In London, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "Ryanair is pleased to have agreed a new 10 year growth 
deal at London Stansted with MAG. This deal will see our Stansted traffic grow by over 50pc, from 13.2m in 2012 to 
over 20m p.a. in return for lower costs and more efficient facilities at Stansted. This agreement, which will create 
over 7000 new jobs in Stansted, proves how UK airports can flourish when released from the dead hand of the BAA 
monopoly and is the first dramatic initiative by MAG to reverse 7 years of decline, during which Stansted's traffic fell 
from 23.8m to 17.5m."

has today released its Stansted summer 2014 schedule, with a total of 120 routes, including 4 new routes to 
Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat in Morocco. This will feature 43 based aircraft in Stansted (up from 37); 
120 routes (up from 116); 4 new routes to Bordeaux, Dortmund, Lisbon and Rabat and over 2,000 weekly flights (up 
from 1,800). In London, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "Ryanair is pleased to have agreed a new 10 year growth 
deal at London Stansted with MAG. This deal will see our Stansted traffic grow by over 50pc, from 13.2m in 2012 to 
over 20m p.a. in return for lower costs and more efficient facilities at Stansted. This agreement, which will create 
over 7000 new jobs in Stansted, proves how UK airports can flourish when released from the dead hand of the BAA 
monopoly and is the first dramatic initiative by MAG to reverse 7 years of decline, during which Stansted's traffic fell 
from 23.8m to 17.5m."

Body
Events of recent weeks have brought airlines back down to earth with a jolt. The prospect of military strikes on Syria 
had already sent the price of jet fuel rocketing, and now a profit warning from the usually dependable Ryanair has 
thrown earnings estimates into doubt.
The industry's rapid ascent had to end eventually. Between September last year and early August 2013, shares in 
Ryanair, easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines had risen on average by 127 per cent.
But all of a sudden, the future looks a little less rosy. The price of oil has topped $100 (£64) a barrel for the past two 
months and recently made a five-year high. The cost of jet fuel - which accounts for around a third of operating 
costs - has risen back above $1,000 per tonne.
Hundreds of jets with more fuel-efficient engines are on order and airlines are selling more lucrative extras - so-
called "ancillary revenue", such as allocated seating and insurance.
Anticipated capacity growth, in the near term at least, appears relatively modest. Stephen Furlong, an analyst at 
Irish broker Davy, expects relatively low supply over the next year or two and a period of more managed growth 
thereafter. Air traffic experts at Eurocontrol believe supply will definitely pick up in 2014. They pencil in 2.8 per cent 
capacity growth next year, and an annual average of 2.3 per cent out to 2019.
Airlines losing altitude Sector focus
Of more immediate concern is Ryanair. Its boss Michael O'Leary, already spitting feathers after the UK Competition 
Commission essentially killed any hopes he had of buying Aer Lingus , issued a shock profit warning . The usually 
ebullient Irishman guided down expectations for full-year net profit to the lower end of the forecast range of between 
EUR570m and EUR600m. If business doesn't improve, it could be worse.
There's been a "perceptible dip in forward fares and yields into September, October and November", warned Mr 
O'Leary, blaming austerity, currencies, price competition and capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavia, Spain and 
Ireland. Ryanair is selectively cutting winter capacity, which will trim 500,000 off the annual traffic target. It is 
slashing fares in these markets, too.
"O'Leary is preparing the market for a price war in Europe, so is reining in yield expectations," reckons Rob Byde, 
transport analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "He's clearly concerned about analysts overcooking their numbers." If right, 
that's sensible, and perhaps justifies taking some money off the table. After all, Ryanair's share price has surged 83 
per cent over the past year, and a correction at some point was inevitable.
But the City senses this could be just a pause. "Don't overplay the profit warning," urges Mr Furlong. "It's a 
readjustment of expectations, but we're not bearish. There isn't suddenly a wall of supply about to hit the market."
Our favourite picks in the sector are Thomson owner TUI Travel, while easyJet looks the more assured of the two 
budget carriers. But don't write off Ryanair. Mr O'Leary has promised to complete the EUR1bn (£840m) programme 
of share buybacks and special dividends by 2015.

Highlight: Shares fall after profit warning
Body
Shares in Aer Lingus fell as much as 7.5 per cent yesterday following a profit warning, which the Irish airline blamed 
on a slump in short-haul business caused by "good weather" and intense pricing competition from rival Ryanair.
The company said it was reducing its forecast for 2013 operating profits to EUR60m, down from EUR69.1m, which 
it had forecast at the publication of its half-year results at the end of July.
"The current booking profile for the rest of the year suggests that despite more aggressive pricing in response to 
market conditions, it will not be possible to recover lost volumes experienced in July and August as a result of the 
warm weather," it said .
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, said Ryanair had "opened the taps" on routes where it faced 
competition in Europe.
"We are less affected than other carriers in Europe but clearly the offering on some of the Ryanair routes [is] below 
their own cost level," he told analysts in a conference call.
Ryanair said it does not comment on the excuses put out by "high fare competitors".
Aer Lingus blames slump in business on good weather; TRANSPORT
The reduced profits guidance issued by Aer Lingus follows a profit warning from Ryanair this month. Europe's 
biggest budget carrier said it was cutting fares in response to increased competition and weakening demand for air 
travel.
David Holohan, analyst at Dublin-based Merrion Stockbrokers, said the profit warning was not a big surprise. 
"Given Ryanair's recent profit warning and increased price competition as a result on Irish/UK routes, lower 
profitability was unavoidable for Aer Lingus whose short-haul network is UK-centric," he said.
Aer Lingus said it expected the competitive pricing environment to continue, and planned to reduce short-haul 
capacity by a minimum of 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with the same quarter last year.
In contrast, the long-haul division at Aer Lingus, which provides flights to and from Ireland and the US, continues to 
perform well and 2013 bookings are running ahead of last year.
Aer Lingus said management was examining ways to accelerate plans for cost cuts to preserve competitiveness 
and protect future profitability. But it warned that take-up of the airline's existing voluntary severance programme 
had been slowed because of delays in resolving a dispute with trade unions regarding a deficit in its pension plan .
Staff at Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority are members of the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme, 
which has a EUR780m shortfall. The airline is proposing to make a one-off contribution to the scheme.
The shares recovered some lost ground to close down 1 per cent at EUR1.48.

Body
The profitability of European airlines will be squeezed in coming months due to heavy discounting by Ryanair, its 
Irish rival Aer Lingus said on Friday as it cut its profit forecast for the year.
Ryanair, which flies more international scheduled passengers than any other European airline, said last week it 
planned to introduce "aggressive" pricing to maintain volumes amid signs of weak demand in the autumn.
The threat of a price war comes as airlines struggle with high fuel costs and weak consumer confidence, although a 
lack of growth in capacity in recent years has kept ticket prices relatively stable.
"Ryanair has opened the taps," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said, adding price cuts were being felt 
across Europe and with "significant intensity" in markets such as Italy and Poland. "We are less affected than other 
carriers in Europe, but clearly the offering currently on the market on some of the Ryanair routes is below their own 
cost level," Mueller said. He said he believed Ryanair was selling tickets at up to 20 euros per passenger below 
cost on some routes. A Ryanair spokesman said it "would not comment on the excuses of high-cost competitors." 
PRICING PRESSURES Ryanair issued its own profit warning last week and with Aer Lingus following suit, it 
indicates pricing pressure will spread across the sector, said Investec analyst Gerard Moore. Aer Lingus cut its 
profit forecast for the year by 13 percent, saying its profit for the full year would be around 60 million euros, down 
from a forecast of 69 million euros (dollar 91.8 million) it made at the end of July. "This shows Ryanair's profit 
warning wasn't just a company specific issue and there's an impact on the broader market," said Moore. "It's 
worrying for the whole sector." In July, Aer Lingus reported weak bookings in July and August due to unusually 
warm weather in Ireland, but said it hoped to make up for that shortfall in the remaining months of the year. In 
Friday's statement the carrier said despite more aggressive pricing it did not now expect to recover the lost 
volumes. It said it would cut short-haul capacity in the final three months of the year by 3 percent, but that long-haul 
bookings for the remainder of 2013 were ahead of last year. Aer Lingus shares were down 7.6 percent at 1.46

Highlight: The Daily Mail has today settled a defamation case brought against them by Ryanair.
Body
The Daily Mail has today settled a defamation case brought against them by Ryanair. The case refereed to a recent 
article about Ryanair in the newspaper that referred to claims made by a group describing itself as a "Ryanair Pilot 
Group", and other claims broadcast in a Channel 4 TV Dispatches programme.
The article was in reference to three fuel emergency landings in Valencia over 12 months ago on 26th July 2012. 
An official report produced by Irish safety agencies confirmed that three aircraft flying over Spain took on extra fuel 
and that all three aircraft flew for over one hour more than planned (due to adverse weather and diversions from 
Madrid to Valencia). According to the report all three aircraft fully complied with EU safety rules when landing safely 
in Valencia.
Ryanair has made say that if pilots have legitimate safety concerns they should report them either directly to

The Daily Mail has today settled a defamation case brought against them by Ryanair. The case refereed to a recent 
article about Ryanair in the newspaper that referred to claims made by a group describing itself as a "Ryanair Pilot 
Group", and other claims broadcast in a Channel 4 TV Dispatches programme.
The article was in reference to three fuel emergency landings in Valencia over 12 months ago on 26th July 2012. 
An official report produced by Irish safety agencies confirmed that three aircraft flying over Spain took on extra fuel 
and that all three aircraft flew for over one hour more than planned (due to adverse weather and diversions from 
Madrid to Valencia). According to the report all three aircraft fully complied with EU safety rules when landing safely 
in Valencia.
Ryanair has made say that if pilots have legitimate safety concerns they should report them either directly to 
Ryanair, or to the Irish Aviation Authority, using their confidential safety reporting systems.

One is better than none
The obviously strapped-for-cash Kuwaiti government is sticking one of its Amiri Flight Airbus A300s on the market.
Before you all figure that it'll be a dinner-party talking point and look nice on the driveway parked next to the Ford 
Mondeo, we'll draw your attention to the fine print.
Some way down a list of 'special conditions' attached to the sale is the minor point that the aircraft "has only one 
engine".
It then goes on to state that the aircraft will not be sold "partially", shamelessly sidestepping the fact that a single-
engined twinjet is partial in anyone's dictionary. Caveat emptor and all that.
Owning up
Tweet from Heathrow airport: "Here's a fun fact to kick off your Friday! @heathrowairport is twice the size in area of 
Gibraltar." The other difference between the two places? The Brits still own Gibraltar.
Left winger
Ryanair marked World Left Handers Day on 12 August with a 100,000-seat sale, which could be booked on the 
company's website by left-hand only.
Ryanair's left-handed chief executive provides the obligatory quote, although it's probably the only time Michael 
O'Leary will describe himself as a "leftie".
Lax on Lancs
Slapped wrists for us, demands Andy Burrows. "Always nice to see a picture of the Panton Brothers' Lancaster," he 
says. Unfortunately, the airfield where the famed Second World War bomber is on display is East Kirby, 
Lincolnshire, not "appropriately, Lancashire" as we noted in our Pic of the Week caption in 6-12 August.

The flightcrew responsible for NX611 operate her on taxi runs, he says, "but they definitely haven't flown her across 
to Lancashire. Yet."
Flying Red Adair
Our 25 Years Ago reference to the Piper Alpha disaster prompts our helicopter test pilot Peter Gray to send in his 
memories of that fateful day.
"I was with Bristow Helicopters, overnighting in Aberdeen to fly to Shetland the next," he recalls. "I was woken by all 
the helicopter traffic. The reason was apparent when I switched on the TV. Instead of proceeding to Shetland, I was 
used to fly an Sikorsky S-61N to the standby platform alongside what was Piper Alpha.
"The sight was dramatic, even traumatic - the sea on fire and molten metal dripping into the sea. How those who 
jumped overboard survived is amazing."
"I later flew out Red Adair. He arrived in his private jet, no customs or immigration. He got on board my S-61N and I 
flew him out to the standby platform. Piper Alpha was still burning."

Cash-flush Aer Lingus urged to sit tight and avoid price war
Cash-flush Aer Lingus urged to sit tight and avoid price war

Any aviation price war sparked by Ryanair in the wake of its profits warning last week could damage Aer Lingus, 
say analysts.
However, they are confident that Aer Lingus's extremely healthy cash position will be its best line of defence against 
fare-slashing by Ryanair.
Ryanair last week said it was planning aggressive seat sales and marketing initiatives in key markets, including 
Ireland. This, it said, was to combat weakening yields that could see it earn less profit than a previously indicated 
full-year net profit range of EUR 570 million to EUR 600 million.
The announcement precipitated an 11.4 per cent plunge in Ryanair's share price, wiping more than EUR 1 billion off 
the value of the company. But it also hit other airlines hard, including Aer Lingus, whose share price fell by 5.8 per 
cent, as investors calculated the prospects for the industry and what would happen to competitors when Ryanair 
responded.
"Ryanair are going to be more aggressive on fares, and that could make life tough for Aer Lingus and other 
European airlines," said one aviation analyst.
Ryanair competitor Easyjet followed up with its own statement, saying that it was not experiencing the negative 
trends indicated by Ryanair. Analysts believe that the problems hitting Ryanair at the moment may be on particular 
routes and also due to competition from other low-cost carriers, such as Norwegian in Scandinavia and Wizz Air in 
central and eastern Europe.
"But the concern is that, if it is happening to Ryanair, it will soon start happening to other airlines, and an aggressive 
reaction from Ryanair is only likely to increase the chances of this," said the analyst.
"In such a scenario, cash is Aer Lingus's biggest defence. Aer Lingus is never going to beat Ryanair in a price war, 
but it is well placed to sit it out and use its cash as a cushion."
Cash-flush Aer Lingus urged to sit tight and avoid price war
Aer Lingus has forecast that it will have EUR 430 million net cash at the end of this year, rising to EUR 473 million 
next year. A price war that caused fares to fall 5 per cent would cost the airline more than EUR 70 million based on 
expected sales.
"So, rather than finishing the year with EUR 430 million, they would finish with EUR 400 million," said the analyst. 
"But hat still gives them a very significant cushion, even if you take into account that as much as EUR 150 million of 
that cash reserve could end up going into the pension fund."

If you've ever wondered what financial journalists do with their time, this week served up an answer. News that 
reflected sunlight from the City's Walkie Talkie skyscraper was melting cars lured scribes into the street to fry eggs 
in the 70C beam. One balding former FT Group hack left his underdone when his follicles began to burn.
Ryanair had to admit this week that its full-year profit is heading the same way as passengers to its European "city" 
airports: many miles from its target destination. News that it would get as close to its EUR570m-EUR600m forecast 
as Barcelona Reus is to the Catalan capital (some 66 miles) sent its shares diving 11 per cent.
Ignore the US non-farm payrolls. Disregard the UK purchasing managers' index. Economic indicator of the week is: 
skirting-board dust. News that Dyson , the vacuum cleaner maker, is hiring 650 fluff-busting engineers has been 
widely reported as proof of a (wait for it) full-blown manufacturing recovery.
Remember making music mix tapes for your friends? Clearly, the ageing hip-hopsters at Ministry of Sound don't. 
This week, in a spat as comical as Eric Morecambe vs Andre Previn, the record label sued digital music service 
Spotify for letting users listen to tunes in the same order as they appear on its compilation CDs.

European equity markets picked up this week, backed by stronger than expected industrial data that helped 
carmakers and bid activity that pushed up telecoms.
After a volatile August, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 began September with a weekly gain of 2.9 per cent to 1,229.86 as 
volumes improved.
Nokia was the standout gainer of the week, up 40.6 per cent to EUR4.12, after it agreed to sell its mobile handsets 
business to Microsoft for EUR5.4bn.
Telecom Italia 's search for strategic partners left the shares at the mercy of trading floor rumour, but they were 
boosted this week on reports of interest from Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris.
AT&T and América Móvil were also among those rumoured to have made preliminary contact. The shares gained 
15.2 per cent to EUR0.61.
BMW and Renault were the best of an improving motor and car parts sector after encouraging data from the US 
and UK.
Renault's 43 per cent stake in Japan's Nissan proved vital due to sales of the Qashqai in Britain and record sales

Thomas Cook , London's best-performing large-cap stock over the past year, led the market higher yesterday on 
talk of another round of cost cutting.
A well-received presentation by its chief executive, Harriet Green, to Credit Suisse's sales force helped lift the 
shares 6.3 per cent to 147.4p. The tour operator has jumped 946 per cent in 12 months as Ms Green cut debt, 
closed shops and sacked staff as part of a three-year recovery plan .
Thomas Cook confirmed that the plan to cut £400m of costs by 2015 was well on track, said Credit Suisse. Yet 
consensus forecasts included just 70 per cent of the target, which now looked conservative, it said.
The broker expected a second restructuring programme when the travel company delivered full-year results in 
November. Procurement, call centres and middle management all looked likely to be pruned, as did a portfolio that 
included 57 travel brands in the UK alone, it said.
Ms Green added that late summer bookings had remained strong in spite of political tensions in Turkey and Egypt, 
and contrary to this week's profit warning from Ryanair . Credit Suisse repeated a 175p target on Thomas Cook 
shares.
The FTSE 100 edged higher by 0.2 per cent, up 14.89 points to 6,547.33. For the week, the index was up 2.1 per 
cent, its biggest weekly gain in nearly two months.
Thomas Cook leads FTSE higher as chief weighs cost-cutting plan; LONDON
Tullow Oil rose 3.6 per cent to £10.70 after partner OMV reported an oil find that could open a development in the 
Barents Sea off Norway.
The discovery eased some pressure on management, whose plans to drill in Arctic waters were said to be meeting 
resistance from shareholders after a bad run of exploration results elsewhere.
"Further drilling is required to determine its full potential, but we think this significant frontier oil discovery could 
begin to restore investor confidence in Tullow's leading exploration capabilities," said Morgan Stanley.
Antofagasta led the mining stocks higher, up 2 per cent to 899p. The copper miner's recent interim results pushed 
back plans to develop greenfield sites, which would free up cash flow over the next two years and allow 
management to restore special dividends from late 2015, said Canaccord Genuity.
Ahead of a trading update on Monday, AB Foods rose 1.2 per cent to £18.51 after SocGen took the stock off its 
"sell" list.
The strength of AB Foods' Primark retail business during the warm summer should offset a poor performance of its 
sugar division, SocGen said.
AB Foods had underperformed this week after Credit Suisse said European sugar prices were being driven lower 
during the current contracting round in anticipation of the EU removing production quotas in 2017.
Imperial Tobacco rose for a fifth straight day, up 1.2 per cent to £22.61, to take its weekly advance to 6 per cent. 
Dealers put the strength down to its above-average dividend yield and robust results from Japan Tobacco, long 
seen as a potential bidder for Imperial.
Software maker Sage Group lost 1.8 per cent to 345.8p after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to "underweight" in a 
sector review.
The broker advised switching into SAP, which it said was on the same valuation in spite of having much stronger 
growth prospects, better industry positioning and a higher gearing to economic recovery.
Imagination Technologies rose 5 per cent to 293.5p, with Peel Hunt positive after a meeting with the chipmaker's 
management.
Insurer Lancashire rose 1.8 per cent to 751p after Credit Suisse turned positive with an 860p target.
Concerns were misplaced that Lancashire's purchase last month of underwriting house Cathedral Capital might 
stem special dividends, Credit Suisse said. Capital efficiencies resulting from the deal should allow Lancashire to 
pay a special dividend in fourth and first quarters, leaving the stock on a yield of 10.2 per cent, it said.
Enterprise Inns edged up 1.1 per cent to 145p after Odey Asset Management raised its stake in the pubs operator 
to 6.59 per cent.

Tate & Lyle was the biggest faller in a rising London market yesterday on fears of competition from Chinese 
manufacturers.
A glut of sucralose, the artificial sweetener discovered by Tate in 1976, meant prices had declined in recent months, 
trade website Food Navigator USA reported. Shortages last year had attracted chemicals makers into the market, 
dragging prices about 25 per cent below the 2012 peak, according to a US distributor of Chinese sucralose quoted 
by the report.
Tate, down 1.6 per cent to 799.5p, lost patent protection for sucralose in 2009 but retains a market share of about 
80 per cent, according to analysts. It has so far fought back against generic manufacturers by offering bulk 
discounts to big customers, which has offset pricing pressure with volume growth.
A choppy market left the FTSE 100 edging to a three-week high, up 0.9 per cent or 57.7 points at 6,532.44.
Marks and Spencer climbed 3.4 per cent to 494.9p on the back of an upgrade from HSBC, which said the stock 
had the highest gearing among retailers to a recovery in UK spending and the housing market. M&S's womenswear 
launch for the autumn season would mark the bottom of the cycle for its general merchandise business and drive 
an acceleration in like-for-like sales, the broker said.
Tate & Lyle turns sour on China competition worries LONDON
Dixons was up 5.9 per cent to 46.9p on news it was disposing of its lossmaking Pixmania and Electroworld Turkey 
divisions on better than expected terms. A dowry of £58m for Pixmania was much lower than the likely closure 
costs of £90m, said Barclays, which called Dixons "the most credible self-help restructuring story in the sector".
Fashion retailer Supergroup climbed 5.9 per cent to £12.27 on better than expected quarterly sales.
Lloyds Banking Group was up 2.9 per cent to 74.8p on reports that market volatility had led the government to 
reconsider its plan to reduce its stake in the lender.
InterContinental Hotels  climbed 2.1 per cent to £18.75 after UBS added the stock to its "buy" list with a £22 target 
price.
A Morgan Stanley upgrade lifted ICAP 6.7 per cent to 400p. Rising rates and volatility made market infrastructure 
providers better value than fund managers, it said, with the broker choosing as its preferred pick London Stock 
Exchange , up 2 per cent to £16.01.
British Airways owner IAG rallied 2.9 per cent to 299.4p, having fallen on Wednesday after Ryanair's profit warning 
eclipsed IAG's own robust traffic figures for August.
Chip designer Imagination Technologies took on 5.7 per cent to 279.3p following news on Wednesday that 
Broadcom had bought Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics, an Imagination customer.

BRITAIN'S top share index marked a three-week closing high yesterday as Lloyds led banks higher in the sector's 
strongest session in two months.
Lloyds jumped 2.9 per cent after both Bernstein and Morgan Stanley gave a target share price of 100p for the bank, 
currently trading at 73p, as the British government prepares for its transfer into full private ownership.
The banking index climbed 2.4 per cent, its biggest daily rise since early July.
"Financials have been notably strong, and Lloyds had a good upgrade ... With smaller government ownership and a 
prospect of a dividend coming, we have seen the worst in Lloyds," Zeg Choudhry, head of equities trading at 
Northland Capital Partners, said.
Airlines, which fell sharply on Wednesday after a profit warning from Ryanair, were also strong risers, with EasyJet 
and IAG both among top gainers after reporting much better passenger numbers. EasyJet closed up 1.73 per cent, 
with IAG rising by 2.9 per cent.
At the close, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 57.70 points, or 0.9 per cent, at 6,532.44, posting its highest 
close since 15 August.
Financials, including banks, insurers and asset managers, added more than 27 points to the index.
Choudhry had targeted a close above 6,535 to confirm a breakout from the recent 50-point range which the index 
has been stuck in since the middle of August.
Europe has shown signs of economic recovery, yet the European Central Bank said yesterday it was ready to 
provide more stimulus if necessary to help the Eurozone's economy further.
Banks lead FTSE to highest close in three weeks LONDON REPORT
However, despite improving economic data and continued monetary support, international tensions over Syria, 
where Russia and China have warned the US against military intervention, have pegged the FTSE 100 back in 
recent weeks.
Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said that uncertainty over Syria would "cap the upside for 
now."
"There is now a lot of cash on the sidelines, however, where people have pulled back from equities, so if the Syrian 
crisis is dealt with swiftly and in a manner that doesn't cause major panic ... then there's definitely room for good 
upside for the FTSE 100, and we could break through new highs."

Defending Wonga [Re: Wonga defends reputation as profits rocket, yesterday] Payday lenders mean different 
things to different people. For many on low incomes, they provide a cash bridge until pay day. For others, they are 
viewed as taking advantage of people in financial need. Those in the latter group are unlikely to have a need for 
Wonga's service, so we might wonder why they matter in this debate. The fact that Wonga's profits have soared 
amid some public scorn suggests that they may not. Perhaps, like Ryanair, Wonga realises that sometimes positive 
publicity isn't what matters.
Name Withheld Green Deal [Re: MP Calls for Green Deal to be ripped up, yesterday] The claim that "high interest 
rates are deterring people from signing up to the Green Deal" is not proven. People should take a second look at 
the actual rates on offer and remember that the golden rule principle of the Green Deal ensures that borrowers 
stand to save more from reduced energy bills than the cost of their repayments. Slow take-up of the Green Deal 
has more to do with the warm summer - people turn their attention to energy efficiency in the winter. Bernard 
Hughes, The Green Deal Finance Company BEST OF TWITTER No rate change from MPC. How long can they 
keep this up with UK economic data improving so rapidly? @asentance UK 10 year gilts have moved above 3 per

SHARES in budget airline EasyJet bounced yesterday as it posted a 3.9 per cent jump in passengers during August 
to 6.1m.
The budget carrier, whose shares had been slammed by a shock profit warning from rival Ryanair on Wednesday, 
said its planes were 1.1 percentage points more full compared to a year ago.
In the last 12 months, EasyJet traffic is up 4.1 per cent on the previous year. The company made no comment on 
current trading, but analysts took this to mean the firm's recent growth trajectory remains on course.
"We believe that EasyJet's operational model leaves it well placed for further good progress," said Wyn Ellis at 
Numis in a note to investors.
However, he added: "Given that the UK has had its sunniest summer for several years and the forecast is for a 
balmy autumn, it would not be surprising if consumer demand for air travel showed some weakness in the autumn."
Smaller carrier Aer Lingus also reported a boost in summer traffic yesterday, with passenger numbers up 0.9 per 
cent to 1.13m in the month.
The airline, which earlier this year fended off a takeover bid by Ryanair, said short-haul traffic had dwindled 0.8 per 
cent, but this was offset by a 17.5 per cent jump on its transatlantic routes.
The pair followed a strong summer for British Airways owner IAG, which earlier in the week revealed a 9.4 per cent 
rise in traffic, helped by the purchase of Spanish budget carrier Vueling.

Shares in EasyJet closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,236p, recovering some of the ground it lost in the wake of 
Wednesday's sector-wide rout. Meanwhile Ryanair's shares rose just 0.5 per cent to (EURO)6.03.

THE FTSE top 100 steadied yesterday, paring early losses after a stronger open in the United States but dogged by 
an airline sector weakened by a profit warning from budget carrier Ryanair.
The FTSE 100, which had been 0.6 per cent lower at midday, retraced its losses entirely in the first hour of trading 
on Wall Street, where a rally in the tech sector drove gains.
While stocks have fallen since late July, UK blue chips have outperformed the S&P 500 over that period. US stocks 
had also missed out on strong gains in Europe on Monday due to the Labour Day holiday.
"The US market was hit a bit harder on the way down, so there''s a correction on that side, which in turn can help in 
Europe," Toby Morris, senior trader at CMC Markets, said.
The FTSE 100 was closed 0.1 per cent higher, up just 6.33 points at 6,466.66 at 14:45 GMT.
Vodafone led gainers, up 2.2 per cent after a five per cent slide on Tuesday with traders attempting to ascertain fair 
value for the stock after it sold its holding in a joint venture with Verizon, prompting a 9.6 per cent gain in a week.
Johnson Matthey also gained strongly, up 1.9 per cent after a target price upgrade from JP Morgan.
Worries about disruption from possible US strike on Syria and a weak update from Ryanair set a soft tone for the 
day for UK-listed airlines.
Budget airline easyJet, which reports traffic numbers today, fell 5.1 per cent while British Airways parent IAG 
dropped 1.2 per cent.
Blue chips end higher despite airline plunge LONDON REPORT
"The market is certainly keeping its eyes on Syria... and if oil prices stay high, airlines would suffer further from that. 
Ryanair had a profit warning, and easyJet is a very similar airline, so there''s concern that easyJet''s numbers may 
follow suit," Lee Armitage, senior trader at Accendo Markets, said.
Shares in the Irish airline, which said it could miss its full-year profit forecast, sank 11 per cent.
The FTSE 100 failed to recover the 6,500 level which it fell through on Tuesday, when shares dropped 0.6 percent 
against a backdrop of investor concern over Syria.
Also weighing on the UK market was a fall in the value of stocks trading without rights to their latest dividend, 
including Resolution, TUI Travel, and BHP Billiton, which took 4.23 points off the index.

The prospect of a costly price war weighed on European airlines' shares after Ryanair warned it could miss its full-
year profit target as it cut fares in response to increasing competition and weakening demand.
Ryanair's shares closed down 11 per cent at EUR6 after it said it expected net profit for 2013-14 to be at the lower 
end of its previous guidance of EUR570m-EUR600m, partly because it was responding to rivals' discounting.
Europe's largest budget airline by revenue warned it could even generate "slightly" less than EUR570m if yields - a 
measure of average fares paid - continued to weaken over the winter.
Airline shares were hit - including those of Aer Lingus, Norwegian Air Shuttle, easyJet, Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group and Air France-KLM - as investors weighed the possibility of a price war.
Some analysts believe there is a significant risk of a battle on routes within Europe as some smaller carriers, such 
as Norwegian Air Shuttle and IAG's Vueling, have increased capacity significantly. Ryanair and easyJet have also 
placed large aircraft orders this year.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, claimed rivals had been lowering fares, adding: "We are going to 
respond aggressively with pricing and promotions in the next number of months." Analysts had been expecting 
Ryanair to generate net profit of just under EUR650m in the year to March 2014.
Price war fears hit airline shares as Ryanair warns on profit target
The group is responding to weaker yields partly by cutting capacity on certain routes during the winter, and expects 
to carry just under 81m passengers in 2013-14, compared with a previous target of more than 81.5m. Capacity 
reductions can allow airlines to raise fares. Ryanair indicated late flight bookings in July had been at weaker than 
expected yields partly because hot weather in northern Europe had prompted some to stay at home rather than fly 
south.

European airlines' shares fell yesterday after Ryanair warned it could miss its full-year profit target as it cut fares in 
response to increasing competition and weakening demand for air travel.
Ryanair's shares closed down 11 per cent at EUR6 after the company said it expected net profit for 2013-14 to 
come in at the lower end of previous guidance of EUR570m-EUR600m, partly because it was responding to rivals'

Airline shares were hit - including those of Aer Lingus, Norwegian Air Shuttle, easyJet, Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group and Air France-KLM - as investors considered the possibility of a price war.
One reason why certain analysts believe there is a risk of a price war on routes within Europe is that some smaller 
carriers - such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and IAG's Vueling - have been increasing aircraft capacity significantly. 
Ryanair and easyJet have also placed large aircraft orders this year.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he did not see a lot of capacity growth currently, adding he was 
surprised by how flight bookings had been "weak" in September and October.

He claimed several rivals had been lowering fares, adding: "We are going to respond aggressively with pricing and 
promotions in the next number of months . . . If that doesn't affect our competitors, then good for them. But I 
suspect, as has happened in the past, they will all be following us."
Analysts had been expecting Ryanair to generate net profit of just under EUR650m in the year to March 2014, and 
one said the company's trading statement was disappointing partly because it had a history of outperforming its 
earnings guidance.
The company is responding to weaker yields partly by cutting aircraft capacity on certain routes during the winter, 
and expects to carry just under 81m passengers in 2013-14, compared with a previous target of more than 81.5m. 
Capacity reductions can give airlines the opportunity to raise fares.
Ryanair indicated late flight bookings in July had been at weaker than expected yields partly because the heatwave 
in northern Europe had prompted some people to stay at home.
While the situation improved in August, Mr O'Leary said the company had noticed a "perceptible dip in forward fares 
and yields into September, October and November" because of several factors.
These were increased price competition and some capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavian, Spanish and Irish 
markets; austerity and weak economic conditions across Europe; and the negative impact of exchange rates 
involving sterling and the euro. About 25 per cent of Ryanair's sales originate in sterling.

AIRLINE shares took a nosedive yesterday after Ryanair, the biggest carrier in Europe, warned that it might miss 
profit targets for the year.
The budget airline said a brewing price war in the UK and several other countries had dented its yields in recent 
weeks, as rivals try to tempt hard-up Europeans into taking more flights.
The effect was made worse by the weakness in sterling, which finance boss Howard Miller said could wipe 
(EURO)50m (£42.3m) from annual profits.
As a result, the Irish firm has told investors its full-year profit after tax is set to come in at the low end of its 
(EURO)570m to (EURO)600m range, having made (EURO)569m in the last financial year.
If fares continue to weaken over the winter, Ryanair said it might even miss its range altogether.
"I have no doubt that the market will be weaker than the industry is expecting over the next couple of months and 
we are going to respond to that by being out there first and being aggres-sive with pricing," chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said.
The company said the lower guidance would not affect its plan to buy back at least (EURO)400m of its shares.
The news that the firm could miss targets came as a shock for investors in Ryanair, which last issued a profit 
warning in 2009.
Europe fare war dents Ryanair 's profit forecasts
Shares in the group fell 11.17 per cent to (EURO)6.03, the lowest closing price since mid-April. The news was 
enough to take other carriers down in Ryanair's wake. EasyJet closed five per cent lower at 1,215p while British 
Airways owner IAG lost 1.26 per cent

Airline stocks were the poorest performers on pan-European indices after Ireland's Ryanair said it was unlikely to 
meet its full-year profit goals.
The Dublin-listed, low-cost carrier fell 13.4 per cent to EUR5.87 after it said austerity measures in Europe had 
crimped demand while currency weakness in Britain - its biggest market - had hit revenues.
"This surprise statement has rocked the sector," said Charlie Menegatos at Accendo Markets. "However, Ryanair 
has reiterated the strength of its balance sheet and added that there will be no change to its planned buybacks and 
dividends for 2014-15."
Peers were down heavily as the sector also remained fragile to geopolitical knocks from Syria, which has driven oil 
prices to six-month highs.
Germany's Lufthansa sank by 2.9 per cent to EUR12.93 while rival budget group Norwegian Air Shuttle shed 6.4 
per cent to NKr210.50.
Aer Lingus , the Irish airline in which Ryanair still holds a near 30 per cent stake, fell 5.8 per cent to EUR1.58.
Shares in SAS , the Swedish airline, jumped 10.5 per cent to SKr14.80 after reporting a profit in its third quarter and 
forecasting a positive full year.

The FTSE Eurofirst 300 inched 0.2 per cent higher to 1,214.96.
The FTSE MIB index in Milan underperformed, falling 1.4 per cent to 16,712.2.
Among the Italian stocks falling on the Eurofirst, UniCredit , the bank, lost 2.3 per cent to EUR4.30.
Among the winners, French aerospace and defence contractor Thales climbed 4.9 per cent to EUR39.29.
The company is a big supplier of cockpit electronics and guidance systems.
Dutch electronics group Philips added 2.7 per cent to EUR24.67 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price to 
EUR27 from EUR26.
K+S , the German potash producer, climbed 2.3 per cent to EUR19 on hopes that a potash industry cartel would be 
formed between Uralkali and Belaruskali, whose split several weeks ago prompted concerns about a drop in prices 
for the fertiliser.

Talk about putting a cat among flying things - in this case, aircraft. Yesterday's mild profit warning from Ryanair had 
a big disturbance effect. The airline's own shares fell 11 per cent, but those of discount rivals easyJet and 
Norwegian Air Shuttle were both off about 5 per cent. The region's flag carriers also weakened, and Bloomberg's 
Emea airlines index dropped 4 per cent. All in response to revised guidance that 2013-14 after-tax profits at 
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier will be at the lower end of a previously advised EUR570m-EUR600m range.
Of course, there is more to it than that. For a start, Ryanair rarely issues profits warnings and usually surpasses 
market profit estimates. So there is a shock factor - although the carrier's late-July increase in hold luggage charges 
had already set a few tongues wagging. Second, while currency movements and Europe's early summer heatwave 
have not been helpful, Ryanair cites softness in autumn demand as the core reason for the downgraded guidance. 
Surprised by this, it plans to respond by grounding another 20-30 aircraft this winter (so 70-80 in total) and lowering 
ticket prices while marketing heavily.
That gives investors two causes for concern. The demand softness may affect other carriers, and Ryanair's 
response could put pressure on yields generally. The looming double-whammy, moreover, comes after a very 
benign period for airline stocks. The Emea index doubled in the 18 months to August, putting the sector on a 15-
times price-earnings multiple.
The real worry, though, is that capacity discipline, admirable during recession, could break down. Planned winter 
seat growth looks higher, but schedules may yet get trimmed (as at Ryanair). HSBC sees a 4 per cent rise, 
European airlines
although some estimates are lower and even that would not be ruinous. Still, with oil prices edging up, it may be a 
nervous time ahead.

Worries about the health of the sugar market put AB Foods under pressure in a flat London market.
AB Foods slid 3.2 per cent to £18.41 after Credit Suisse forecast that the European Union's contract round for 2014 
would cut prices by up to 15 per cent.
Analysts expect Europe's sugar market to provide about a fifth of AB Foods' earnings this year, with prices holding 
relatively steady until 2017 when the EU scraps national quotas limiting production.
However, sugar prices were already beginning to reflect the regime change as Brussels piled on the political 
pressure, said Credit Suisse.
The wider market rallied from an opening decline, with the FTSE 100 ending up 6.33 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 
6,474.74.
Travel companies were the sharpest fallers after Ryanair said pricing had deteriorated in recent weeks as 
competition increased in key markets.
Airlines have been this year's top-performing stocks as stable fuel prices and capacity withdrawal meant market 
expectations outpaced company guidance.
Ryanair's London-traded stock lost 11.2 per cent to EUR6.03, while easyJet was down 5.1 per cent to £12.15.
AB Foods under pressure as health of sugar sector queried; London
British Airways owner IAG was down 1.3 per cent to 291p even after reporting continued growth in premium traffic 
for August and telling analysts it had seen no evidence of the weakness Ryanair had experienced.
Holiday companies also suffered after Ryanair's warning. Thomas Cook  fell 4.8 per cent to 135.7p and Tui Travel 
was off 3.2 per cent to 334.6p as the latter stock traded ex a 3.75p dividend.
Ashtead dropped 5.3 per cent to 651p to profit-taking even after the US-focused plant hire group's first-quarter 
results beat consensus expectations.
JPMorgan Cazenove remained cautious, saying comparison periods got tougher for the remainder of the year and 
the shares were already at 17 times earnings.
Vodafone was up 2.2 per cent to 207p to lead the FTSE 100, having weakened sharply to profit-taking on Tuesday 
following confirmation that it was selling Verizon Wireless.
Deutsche Bank said investors might have misunderstood Vodafone's own guidance because its net debt guidance 
included the effects of its acquisition of Kabel Deutschland whereas its cash flow guidance did not.
The upshot was that Vodafone's post-deal businesses remained at a "substantial discount to peers", suggesting 
upside to around 240p, Deutsche said.
TalkTalk climbed 1.9 per cent to 258.2p on reports that the internet provider might be a takeover target for 
Vodafone, though investors said Vodafone was highly unlikely to be looking at UK acquisitions following its 
purchase last year of C&W Worldwide.
A late burst of speculative demand among day traders lifted Imperial Tobacco 1.4 per cent to £21.84. A day before 
results, Monitise climbed 16.8 per cent to a record high of 53.8p after Goldman Sachs tipped the cash transfer 
system developer as a likely takeover target.
Setting a 100p target price, it forecast Monitise to deliver annual revenue growth of 50 per cent over the next five 
years and reach cash flow break-even by 2015.

Shares in Ryanair suffered their biggest drop in four years Wednesday after Europe's top budget airline issued a 
rare profit warning due to low autumn ticket sales that reflected the weak economy and aggressive competition.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said his Dublin-based airline, which typically exceeds its profit forecasts, now 
expects to fall short of its previous 2014 outlook and might not reach its minimum sales target of 570 million euros 
($751 million) for the fiscal year ending in March.
The company's shares fell nearly 15 percent to 5.78 euros ($7.62) a five-month low and their biggest drop since 
October 2009 as analysts expecting Ryanair to eclipse 600 million euros in profit warned that the airline now looked 
overvalued. Ryanair last issued a profit warning in 2004.
Ryanair's statement sent the shares of other European airlines lower Wednesday. Ryanair's top budget competitor, 
Britain's easyJet, fell 7.5 percent. International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, fell 
more than 4 percent. Ryanair's main Irish rival, Aer Lingus, slid 5 percent. Lufthansa and Air France-KLM also 
traded lower.
O'Leary told a conference call that Ryanair's sales were experiencing "a perceptible dip" for the September-
November period amid stronger competition in key British, Spanish and Scandinavian markets.
He said Ryanair would ground selected winter services, reduce its planned passenger payload from 81.5 million to 
81 million still a record for the ever-expanding airline and offer steeper discounts on tickets for travelers in Ireland, 
Britain, Scandinavia and Spain.
He told journalists that Ryanair's weakening sales represented a "marginal" challenge, and was nothing like 
"collapse or catastrophe."
Since launching a single Ireland-England route in 1985, Ryanair has grown to become the most influential and 
successful airline in Europe, enjoying solid growth even as its recession-hit industry endured massive losses, 
business failures and mergers. Ryanair pioneered policies of charging extra for everything from boarding cards to

assigned seats, but many of these customer-annoying practices designed to drive Ryanair cost-efficiency as well as 
profits have gradually been adopted by competitors struggling to keep pace.

Renewed worries about a possible U.S. military strike against Syria sent global stock markets lower Wednesday.
Optimism brought about by strong economic indicators, particularly a manufacturing survey in the U.S., dissipated 
amid fears of a possible escalation in Syria's civil war following a chemical attack that killed scores of civilians. The 
U.S. government contends the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad is responsible.
"Investors are set to stay cautious with one eye on the Syria development" ahead of this week's G-20 gathering of 
world leaders in Russia and U.S. employment data on Friday, said Gary Yau, an analyst at Credit Agricole CIB.
The so-called U.S. non-farm payroll figures, released this Friday, are a closely watched indicator of the country's 
economy and can set the tone for the markets for weeks to come.
Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.5 percent to 6,434.37 while Germany's DAX declined 0.5 percent to 8,136.87 and 
France's CAC-40 dropped 0.7 percent to 3,946.69.
Wall Street was expected to slip on the open Dow Jones industrial futures were 0.1 percent lower at 14,810, while 
S&P 500 futures were down the same rate at 1,637.75.
Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed early losses and rose 0.5 percent to close at 14,053.87, but benchmarks elsewhere in 
Asia fell. South Korea's Kospi declined almost 0.1 percent to 1,933.03. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.7 percent 
to 5,161.60. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.3 percent to 22,326.22.
President Barack Obama has faced difficulty trying to amass support for U.S. military intervention in Syria, where an 
alleged chemical attack by government forces killed scores of civilians outside of Damascus. Britain's parliament 
voted against involvement, and Russia, a strong ally of Syria, has been sharply critical.
But Obama got a critical boost on Tuesday when a top U.S. lawmaker said he backed the U.S. president's call for a 
military strike. That intensified worries about the possible expansion of a conflict in an already volatile region of the 
world.
Syria conflict worries weigh on markets
Still, the investment mood had been supported somewhat this week by an increase in corporate deal-making and 
growing confidence in the global economy. Verizon agreed Monday to buy out the remaining stake in its mobile 
phone business from Vodafone in a massive $130 billion deal and Microsoft announced Tuesday it would take over 
Nokia's smartphone business and a portfolio of patents and services.
However, Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, saw its shares slump 12.6 percent after it warned it would likely 
miss its earnings targets this year. It said tickets sales for the autumn had fallen short of expectations.
Benchmark crude for October delivery was down 65 cents to $107.89 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $1.15 to close at $107.65 on Friday.
In currencies, the euro rose to $1.3175 from $1.3169 late Tuesday. The dollar fell to 99.54 yen from 99.62 yen.

Almost a billion euro was wiped off the value of Ryanair this morning after it warned it could miss its full-year profit 
forecast following a dip in bookings.
The shares in the Irish Stock Exchange were down 96c to E5.81 by 15:15 this morning.
The airline blamed growing competition and a drop in the value of the British pound.
This is a surprise statement from Ryanair and comes contrary to some of the commentary from the peer group and 
indeed Ryanair's own commentary at its June investor days," said Goodbody analyst Donal O'Neill. Airlines across 
Europe have been struggling with weak economies, high fuel prices and costly fleet upgrades. While Ryanair has 
fared better than most thanks to its focus on low prices, it faces competition from other airlines looking to win 
business in the budget segment of the market. Goodbody analysts said Norwegian, Aer Lingus and IAG 
subsidiaries Iberia and Vueling had all stepped up competition to Ryanair. The Irish airline said it had noticed a 
"perceptible dip" in yields - average revenue per mile per passenger - for September, October and November, and 
cited increased competition in Britain, Scandinavia, Spain and Ireland. It also said an austerity drive across Europe 
and a weaker British currency were hurting demand. Ryanair makes about a quarter of its revenue in Britain. As a 
result, the group said net profit for the year ending March 2014 was likely to be at the bottom end of its previously 
guided range of 570-600 million euros (481 million - 506 million pounds) Most analysts had expected the airline to 
comfortably beat that forecast range, with a company poll in July forecasting a full-year net profit of 643 million 
euros. "If fares and yields continue to weaken over the coming winter there can be no guarantee that the full year 
outturn may not finish at or slightly below the lower end of this range," Ryanair said. The last time Ryanair warned 
profits would be at the bottom of a previously guided range was 2009, while it last issued a full profit warning in 
2004. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair would respond to weak bookings by cutting capacity for the

Ryanair has said that it expects its full year results will be at the lower end of its full year net profit range of E570m 
to E600m.
In a trading statement, the airline said that while it remains comfortable with its first half year guidance, recent 
weakness in forward yields into the third quarter suggests that there will be no upgrade to full year guidance.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that Ryanair had noticed its late bookings in July had been at 
weaker than expected yields due to the heatwave in Northern Europe and weaker sterling/euro exchange rates.
''The booking pattern returned to some normality in August, which will ensure that our H1 guidance remains 
unchanged, which is for a small increase in H1 profits over the prior year H1 comparable,'' he added.
However, Mr O'Leary said that in recent weeks the airline has noted a ''perceptible dip'' in forward fares and yields 
into September, October and November. He said this is due to increased price competition and some capacity 
increases in the UK, Scandinavia, Spanish and Irish markets, the continuing effect of austerity and weak economic 
conditions across Europe and weaker sterling/euro exchange rates according to RTE News.

The ISEQ plunged this morning as close to a billion euro was wiped off the value of Ryanair shares following a 
warning on earnings.
The index fell 98.87 points to 4,130.84.
Almost a billion euro was wiped off the value of Ryanair this morning after it warned it could miss its full-year profit 
forecast following a dip in bookings. Shares were down 86c to E5.91. The airline blamed growing competition and a 
drop in the value of the British pound. This is a surprise statement from Ryanair and comes contrary to some of the 
commentary from the peer group and indeed Ryanair's own commentary at its June investor days," said Goodbody 
analyst Donal O'Neill. Airlines across Europe have been struggling with weak economies, high fuel prices and 
costly fleet upgrades. While Ryanair has fared better than most thanks to its focus on low prices, it faces 
competition from other airlines looking to win business in the budget segment of the market. Goodbody analysts 
said Norwegian, Aer Lingus and IAG subsidiaries Iberia and Vueling had all stepped up competition to Ryanair. The 
Irish airline said it had noticed a "perceptible dip" in yields - average revenue per mile per passenger - for 
September, October and November, and cited increased competition in Britain, Scandinavia, Spain and Ireland. It 
also said an austerity drive across Europe and a weaker British currency were hurting demand. Ryanair makes 
about a quarter of its revenue in Britain.
IFG stocks rose 1c to E1.30. Direct to consumer 'investment supermarket', Hargreaves Lansdown, has reported 
strong organic growth in the year to end-June with AUA up 38pc to £36.4bn, revenue up 22pc to £282.4m and PBT 
up 28pc to £195.2m. "The challenge facing the group is to change its pricing model to comply with the RDR. It plans 
to offer funds with lower annual management changes and at the same time introduce charges for the service it 
provides, but details have yet to be revealed. In contrast, IFG focuses on the IFA market and is already fully RDR-
compliant," said Davy Stocckbrokers.

Body
Britain's top share index fell today, extending the previous session's losses, as leading U.S. lawmakers' support for 
military action against Syria took its toll on investor sentiment.
Airlines suffered steep falls, with budget airline easyJet off 7 percent, while British Airways parent IAG dropped 4 
percent, as traders cited a read-across from Ryanair's weak update.
Shares in the Irish group, which said it could miss its full-year profit forecast, sank 14 percent.
A fall in the value of stocks trading without the attraction of their latest dividend, including Resolution, TUI Travel, 
and BHP Billiton, weighed on the index to the tune of 4.23 points on Wednesday. The FTSE 100 was down 17.79 
points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,450.62 points by 0735 GMT, having dropped 0.6 percent on Tuesday against a backdrop 
of investor concern over Syria. "Upside is going to be limited for now, at least till the Obama attacking Syria 
situation is resolved," said Lex van Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, which manages around dollar 
500 million in assets. This uncertainty means he will look to sell into any strength. Late on Tuesday, leaders of the 
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee reached an agreement on a draft authorisation for the use of force in 
Syria, paving the way for a vote by the committee on Wednesday. However, the draft is much narrower than the 
request made by President Barack Obama and includes a provision barring the use of U.S. troops on the ground. 
GFT Markets technical analyst Fawad Razaqzada was cautious on the UK benchmark given the situation in Syria 
and ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report which he said will likely have a significant bearing on the index's direction. 
The data will put the focus squarely back onto the debate over when the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back its 
huge bond-buying programme which has fuelled a rally in world equities over the past year. In the meantime, 
Razaqzada would not rule out a drop to around 6,332, the 200-day moving average. ( C ) Reuters

(RTTNews) - The UK market is trading lower on Wednesday, as investors continued to monitor the situation in Syria 
after U.S. President Barrack Obama secured more support for a military intervention in the civil-war torn country.
On the economic front, the euro area economy exited its longest recession on record as initially estimated during 
the quarter ended June, second estimate from Eurostat showed. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent 
quarter-on-quarter, in line with flash estimate.
Retail sales in Eurozone increased less than expected in July, Eurostat said. Sales rose 0.1 percent in July from a 
month earlier compared with forecast for a 0.2 percent growth.
Activity in the German private sector economy increased for the fourth successive month in August, final data from 
a survey conducted jointly by Markit Economics and BME showed.

Ryanair Issues Profit Warning On Heatwave, Adverse Currency

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Wednesday said it expects full year profit to be at the lower 
end of its net profit guidance, citing a recent weakness in forward yields into the third quarter amid the heatwave in 
Northern Europe and weaker sterling /euro exchange rates.
In a trading update, the budget airline said while it remains comfortable with its first-half guidance, the weakness in 
forward yields suggests that there will be no upgrade to full year guidance.
The company now expects the full year profit to be at the lower end of its outlook of 570 million to 600 million euros.
However, if fares and yields continue to weaken over the coming winter there can be no guarantee that the full year 
profit may not finish at or slightly below the lower end of this range, Ryanair cautioned.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said, "As indicated during our Q1 results presentation on July 29, close in late 
bookings in July had been at weaker than expected yields due primarily to the heatwave in Northern Europe and 
weaker sterling/euro exchange rates.''
O'Leary added that the close in booking pattern returned to some normality in August, thus ensuring that its first-
half guidance for a small increase in profits over the prior year remains unchanged.
Yet, forward fares and yields into September, October and November were affected due to increased price 
competition and some capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavia, Spanish and Irish markets, in addition to the 
effect of austerity and weak economic conditions across Europe as well as weaker sterling/euro exchange rates.
Ryanair said it would respond to this lower yield outlook by selectively reducing its winter season capacity, thus 
cutting its full year traffic target from over 81.5 million to just under 81 million. The airline will also offer a range of 
lower fares and aggressive seat sales, especially in UK, Scandinavia, Spain and Ireland.
The airline said it is confident of continuing to hit its revised passenger targets albeit at lower fares and yields than 
previously expected.
According to the company, even at or slightly below 570 million euros in profit after tax, Ryanair's cash flows and 
balance sheet remain in good health.
Ryanair Issues Profit Warning On Heatwave, Adverse Currency
There is no change to the recently announced plans to complete share buybacks of at least 400 million euros and 
up to 600 million euros through a combination of dividends and/or buybacks in fiscal March 2015, Ryanair added.
RYA.L plunged 13.9 percent in early morning trading at 5.85 euros.

UPDATE: A warning from Ryanair that it could miss its full year profit forecast hit shares both in the Dublin based 
budget airline and its FTSE 100 competitor Easyjet (EZJ.L) on Wednesday morning.
Ryanair shares tumbled 13% lower to 5.85 after the low cost carrier said it expects full year profits to be at the lower 
end of its 570 million to 600 million forecast, or could even fall below that range.
Other airlines fell in Ryanair's wake. Easyjet fell 7.1% to £11.89, while British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) declined 
4.2% to 282p.
Edgy investors shrink back from shares (08:18) European shares slipped lower in early trade, as investors prepared 
for a barrage of important economic news and eyed growing US political support for an attack on Syria.
The FTSE 100 fell 0.3% to 6,446, having fallen 0.6% on Tuesday and 2.7% over the past month. Europe's Eurofirst 
300 dropped 0.1% to 1,210.
Weighing on sentiment, John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said he would 
back president Barack Obama's plans for military action against Syria.
In addition, several London stocks were trading 'ex dividend' and subsequently weighing on the overall index. BHP 
Billiton (BLT.L), Aggreko (AGGK.L), ARM Holdings ARM.L), Croda (CRDA.L), IMI (IMI.L), Resolution (RSL.L), 
Serco (SRP.L), Shire (SHP.L) and Tui (TT.L) were all trading without their dividend appeal.
Asian stocks had been mixed overnight despite a rebound in China's services sector adding to other upbeat data 
from the world's second largest economy this week. The HSBC China services PMI rebounded to a five-month high 
of 52.8 in August, up from 51.3 in July.
HSBC's Ma Xiaoping attributed the growth to the 'impact of Beijing's fine-tuning measures and an improvement in 
manufacturing activities', adding that the pace of recovery would pick up 'due to a rebound in the property market, 
filtering through of the VAT reform and Beijing's mini-stimulus'.
In addition to uncertainty over the impact of military action against Syria on the rest of the Middle East, there's 
plenty more to keep investors anxious. Yesterday's surprisingly strong ISM survey in the US offers more support for 
the Federal Reserve to start 'tapering' its asset purchases when the bank's FOMC committee meets in two weeks. 
Friday's jobs report will provide more clues on the fate of QE.
Ryanair profit warning drags down Easyjet shares
And in Europe, both the Bank of England and European Central Bank will tomorrow announce their latest policy 
decisions, though neither is expected to do anything new. The chief of the eurozone's bank, Mario Draghi, will 
follow up with a press conference.
A second reading of Eurozone GDP growth for the second quarter of the year was due at 10am UK time this 
morning, following the preliminary report that showed growth of 0.3%, marking an end to the bloc's six quarter long 
recession.
In addition, PMI survey data for Europe will show whether that rebound continued into August.
Vodafone leads FTSE, Hargreaves lower Investors didn't take kindly to a financial update from financial services 
provider Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV.L), sending the shares down 3% to £10.01. The decline came despite a 
31% hike in the company's full year dividend and 28% rise in full year profits.
Investors continued to assess Vodafone's (VOD.L) huge deal to offload its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to 
Verizon Communications for $130 billion (£84 billion), with a 1.8% share price gain to 206p earning the telecoms 
company top spot on the FTSE 100, having fallen yesterday.
As part of the third largest deal in corporate history, $84 billion will be dished out to investors in cash and shares.

Maurice Buckley has been chief executive of the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) since 2007, leading 
a team of more than 150 staff in offices in Ireland and the US. NSAI helps companies to increase standards, cut 
costs and become more competitive. NSAI is Ireland's official standards body and the national certification authority 
for CE Marking, providing a certification service to enable businesses to demonstrate that Irish goods and services 
conform to applicable standards.
...........................
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
NSAI provides very important technical services to business in Ireland. My job, in leading the organisation, is to 
make sure we optimise these services for the constantly changing economic environment we operate in. My 
responsibility is to make sure that standards, metrology and certification become a competitive advantage for Irish 
businesses and a catalyst for growth.
NSAI is also the gatekeeper to the international world of standards and business practice. My job is to find a way to 
optimise that linkage between the Irish market, the European and global markets, by representing Ireland among 
international standards bodies.
**What motivates you in your job?**
To constantly come across the work of immense value we are carrying out in the various corners of the organisation 
and to be able to raise the profile of that work and make it more widely available. I find it inspiring to see the 
contribution of very dedicated public servants, striving to offer the highest levels of service, despite stretched 
resources.
Working Week
NSAI staff can see the value we add for companies. They are motivated by what they see as the direct link between 
what we do and the success of the companies we work with. Seeing the tangible results of our work is highly 
motivating.
**How would you describe your work style?**
I bring out the best in the people around me. I draw out their ideas, their expertise and their capability.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned?**
That I don't need to have all the answers. On any issue, the team of people around you will come up with better 
ideas and better solutions than you alone could arrive at, provided you can release their energy, imagination and 
knowledge. There is so much talent and expertise available to you, if you can create the environment in which 
people can use it.
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire?**
Tony Ryan of GPA [Guinness Peat Aviation]. In my opinion, he was one of the first business people to really think 
globally, and had huge ambition, incredible discipline and energy. When you look at some of the people and the 
companies that have come through on his coat-tails -- people like Denis O'Brien and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary -- 
and indeed the very vibrant aircraft leasing sector we now have in Ireland, you see that his legacy, some 30 years 
later, goes way beyond what he started in GPA.
**What is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
You must view your career as a continuous evolution. Don't pigeonhole yourself. Modern business is moving so fast 
that, over a 40-year career, you should anticipate working in three or four different roles and areas, and you should 
start preparing yourself for that from the early days and avoid blinkered thinking.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face?**
In the short term, we have a plethora of challenges: finance for business; coming out of this recession; and reducing 
our high levels of unemployment. We will achieve these and then, in the longer term, I would say our biggest 
challenge is to find the next generation of competitive advantages that will allow Ireland to build growth into the 
future.
During the 80s, this was our low-cost manufacturing and during the 90s and into the Tiger years, it was our skills 
base.
**What is your ultimate professional goal?**
To be able to look back in a number of years at what will hopefully be a very successful Irish economy, and to be 
able to say that I and the team in NSAI played a part in being a catalyst for that success.

Etihad to swoop on Aer Lingus?
We have moved on a lot from the time when the Department of Transport used to be referred to as "the downtown 
office of Aer Lingus". Back then, there was a perception that what the airline wanted, it got -- and indeed, this often 
seemed to be the case.
Then Ryanair arrived, and everything changed. The fate of the two airlines seemed linked for many years, from 
Ryanair's fight with Aer Lingus for market share on the Dublin-Britain routes to its pioneering of low-cost flights 
across Europe.
Now, however, Ryanair is a major international player, albeit still with a strong business out of Ireland. Aer Lingus 
remains, essentially, an Irish airline. While the latest decision by the British Competition Commission that Ryanair 
must sell down its Aer Lingus stake from 29.8 per cent to, at most, 5 per cent was welcomed by Aer Lingus. Ryanair 
has vowed to appeal.
Legal experts differ on how long Michael O'Leary could draw this out for, and even that is likely to be decided in the 
courts. But whether it is six months or a year and a half, nobody gives O'Leary much chance of winning an appeal.
What we need to understand, of course, is that this is mission-critical to the future of Aer Lingus, but not to the 
future of Ryanair. True, O'Leary wanted to take over Aer Lingus, attracted by its transatlantic business, some of its 
Heathrow slots and the opportunities this would open up.
But he has plenty of other options. Ryanair has stayed true to its low-cost model, and remains one of the most 
efficient airlines in Europe. It has 175 new Boeing jets on order and various options of where to deploy them.
Aer Lingus now looks more solid than it did a few years ago, in terms of trading. However, its pension problem 
remains unsolved and, as well as O'Leary, the government -- with a 25 per cent stake -- will also be a seller.
Cliff Taylor: Etihad to swoop on Aer Lingus ?
Etihad, the Middle Eastern airline, already has a 3 per cent stake and has expressed an interest in buying the 
government's shares. It could also up its stake by buying most of the Ryanair shares. However, unless it got special 
clearance from the stock exchange, Etihad could not buy more than 29.9 per cent without bidding for the rest of the 
company -- and as a non-EU airline, it cannot take more than 50 per cent anyway.
Etihad, of course, already has a stake in Aer Berlin and could use it as a vehicle. Indeed, as we report today, it 
already plans to get efficiencies between Aer Lingus and Etihad in areas such as ground handling and this could 
develop.
However, the central question remains. Who will own Aer Lingus in, say, two to three years' time? Would Willie 
Walsh's IAG -- keeping its Heathrow slots -- step in? Or could there be a shuffle in the share register which saw the 
government and Ryanair leave, without any other player buying a majority stake? Interestingly, some shareholders 
are said to fear that O'Leary could target Aer Lingus more aggressively if, in fact, he did sell down his stake.
The board and management of Aer Lingus will want to get this sorted out sooner rather than later. With O'Leary 
holding fire for the moment, is there now a case for the government to move ahead and sell to Etihad? This would 
at least allow the government to control the sale and give Aer Lingus a strong airline shareholder.
The pension issue has to be fixed first, of course, but after that, somebody needs to decide what to do.
..........................
**BoI's plans**
All the signs are that Bank of Ireland will launch a fund-raising this autumn to raise cash to buy out the 
government's EUR 1.8 billion preference shareholding. The bank has an incentive to do this before next March, 
when, under the terms on which the shares were issues, a EUR 450 million penalty would kick in, payable when the 
shares are redeemed. Raising the cash to buy back the shares would also be an important pointer that Bank of 
Ireland was on the road back to "normality."
The bank's senior executives will be talking to investors after its recent annual results to judge their appetite.
The shares have traded quite well and, as a recent report from Glas Securities pointed out, the bank could surely 
rely on the government -- which holds 15 per cent of the ordinary equity -- and the consortium of US/Canadian 
investors who bought 35 per cent in 2011 to take up their full rights. That would be half of total shareholders 
accounted for.
Of course, this will all depend on market conditions and a key pointer will be the massive £6 billion (EUR 7 billion) 
rights issue being launched by Barclays this month, to try to fill a capital hole in its balance sheet.
If Barclays goes well and the share price remains above 20 cent, it is hard to see Bank of Ireland delaying much 
longer.
Glas believes they could aim to raise around EUR 1 billion from a right issue -- based on a current market value of 
just over EUR 6 billion. Further cash could be raised by the sale of a debt instrument
It is a big call for chairman Archie Kane and chief executive Richie Boucher.
However, if the market looks in any way favourable -- and having held off in the spring -- they will surely push ahead 
in the autumn.

Ryanair expecting to lose legal case involving French tax and labour laws

Ryanair has admitted that it expects to lose a court case in Marseille later this month for breaching France's tax and 
labour laws.
In an internal memo sent to the airline's 3,000 pilots on July 29, Ryanair's director of flight and ground operations, 
David O'Brien, said that pending courts cases in France, Italy and Britain would not affect the contractual 
arrangements of Ryanair and/or Brookfield, an aviation company through which many of its pilots are contracted.
O'Brien went on to state: "While we expect to lose the Marseille case (and we will then appeal it), it will have no 
effect on our temporary summer operation at Marseille or the crews who temporarily operate there."
The case centres around a Ryanair operation which started up in Marseille-Provence in 2007. The operation 
involved four planes and 127 employees, but was not registered as a business activity with URSSAF, the French 
union which organises the national social security system.
As a result, Ryanair was accused of employing crews unlawfully and withholding employee benefits such as 
pension plans and union rights. Ryanair has claimed that its business is subject only to Irish and European law, and 
that workers are employed under Irish contracts.
It argued that company aircraft constituted Irish territory, so that crews were effectively employed in Ireland.
The prosecutor in the French case has demanded that four Ryanair aircraft be seized and a maximum fine of EUR 
225,000 be applied for breach of the country's tax and labour laws. A ruling is expected on September 25. O'Brien's 
memo to the pilots, which has been seen by this newspaper, was in response to an update posted by a pilot group 
which claims to represent the low cost carrier's pilots.
O'Brien wrote: "As you are aware, we ignore most of the rubbish issued by the "Non-Ryanair Pilot Group".
He then went on to dismiss "claims" made by the group in relation to court cases in Norway.
Ryanair expecting to lose legal case involving French tax and labour laws
These cases, which are separate from the French action, related to two cabin crew and a cabin supervisor who took 
cases of unfair dismissal against the airline. Jurisdiction became a key element in both cases.
The initial local court ruling was in favour of Ryanair's position, but the appeal court in both cases found in favour of 
the cabin crew.
A Ryanair spokeswoman confirmed the ruling will be appealed, and said the former employees will not be 
compensated.
In relation to the Marseille case, she said: "When we lose in the Marseille court, we will appeal this ruling and the 
French decree to the European Court, which is the overriding authority.
Since the Marseille base now operates on a temporary (summer only) basis it is not covered by the French decree. 
When we lose the case in Marseille we expect to be fined, which we will appeal. Our Irish-registered aircraft cannot 
be confiscated."

Aer Lingus ground handling deal points to deeper relationship with Etihad
Aer Lingus ground handling deal points to deeper relationship with Etihad

Aer Lingus is to take over ground handling services for Etihad at Dublin Airport in a move that could be the prelude 
to the airline upping its stake in the national carrier.
Etihad, which already owns 2.99 per cent of Aer Lingus, is anxious to deepen the commercial and operational 
relationship between the two airlines, and there is "an open line of discussion" between the two management teams 
on a range of issues, according to several informed sources.
The ground handling contract, which was previously held by Servisair, marks a return by Aer Lingus to third-party 
handling for the first time in a decade. Etihad is also anxious to involve Aer Lingus in a group-wide aircraft 
purchasing programme that could mean major cost savings for the Irish airline, sources said.
Etihad chief executive James Hogan said, last August, that the Middle Eastern airline was interested in buying 
Ryanair's near 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. It was also reported that Etihad had inquired about buying the 
state's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
At the time, Hogan described Dublin as "strong, profitable route for us . . . we are very keen to strengthen our 
partnership there". Well-placed sources said that his thinking on the matter has not changed since.
Last year, Hogan said Etihad would review its holding in Aer Lingus once regulators completed their review of 
Ryanair's bid for the airline. That bid has since been rejected, and last week the British Competition Commission 
ruled that Ryanair must sell down its stake to 5 per cent.
Etihad's incremental investment in Virgin Australia may provide a model for its ambitions with Aer Lingus, according 
to a source. A year ago it bought 3.96 per cent of the Australian airline, later increasing its stake to 10 per cent. Last 
month it said it was further increasing its stake to 19.9 per cent.
It also revealed that the revenue it generated through codeshare and equity-alliance partners was $184 million in 
the second quarter, up 25 per cent in a year. Etihad believes its equity alliances can save it money through joint 
Aer Lingus ground handling deal points to deeper relationship with Etihad
initiatives covering pilot and crew training, negotiations with airports, marketing, fuel insurance, and procurement 
and maintenance agreements for common aircraft engine types.
The Abu Dhabi-based airline is understood to be in the final stages of talks with Boeing and Airbus on potential 
aircraft orders in coming decades for its "equity alliance group" which has a global fleet of more than 500 aircraft. 
Apart from Aer Lingus, this includes India's Jet Air, Air Berlin, Virgin Australia, Serbia's Jat Airways and Air 
Seychelles.
Any airline in which Etihad has a stake of more than 3 per cent will be able to avail of the joint purchasing deal 
being hammered out part of these discussions, Hogan is reported to have told an aviation conference in Australia in 
recent weeks. Both Aer Lingus, Etihad and Air Berlin fly Airbus A320, while Aer Lingus and Etihad have also 
ordered longhaul A350 aircraft.
"Shared procurement would make a lot of sense but will probably only happen if Etihad increases its equity stake in 
Aer Lingus," said one aviation industry expert. "Larger airlines taking minority equity stakes in smaller airlines is a 
new model for developing commercial alliances that has been led by Etihad.  
"A key advantage to Etihad of deepening the relationship with Aer Lingus is that it opens up the prospect for it to 
use Dublin as a transatlantic base," said the expert.

Anyone who has ever felt short-changed by Ryanair 's hand-luggage scales may see a pleasing irony in the 
Competition Commission ruling on the airline's Aer Lingus stake. At 29.8 per cent, it has been deemed overweight. 
Ryanair plans to appeal - an option not given to people charged £60 plus VAT to stow a laptop bag.
Conveniently situated on the cusp of a housing bubble, this beautifully presented chain of contemporary estate 
agencies is just moments from the Stock Exchange, and offers ample parking for oiks in Mini Coopers. Yes, 
Foxtons has put a "For Sale" sign up on £55m of new shares, in an IPO. Viewing of the prospectus essential!

Minicab drivers of provincial Britain be warned. This week, Nissan - popular provider of vehicles for air-freshened 
curry house pickups - has announced plans to launch self-driving cars by 2020. Rumours that Japanese boffins are

Where are you going?" "Nowhere." "I mean, where are you going on your next trip?" "I repeat, I'm not going 
anywhere."
At this point, a look almost of panic enters the interlocutor's eyes: what is the matter with this person?
In some circles, being constantly on the move has come to be seen not only as a badge of success, but as proof of 
membership of the human race. The stay-at-home person belongs to an inferior species.
The odd thing is that this has coincided with the dire transformation of travel - especially air travel - from something 
glamorous and exciting into a penance and a humiliation, governed by the philosophy of sadistic meanness brought 
to a fine art by Irish low-cost airline Ryanair.
Those on the status treadmill of constant travel are victims of a delusion, or are simply behind the times: this was 
the conclusion I came to in a discussion with a wise Spanish diplomat friend - "people think there is something 
wrong with you if you are not travelling," he said, "but you are the lucky one."
This applies especially to summers in London. A mass evacuation of the capital occurs around the middle of July, 
leaving the city's roads blessedly free of traffic (parents transporting kids a few hundred yards to school in troop 
carriers are nowhere to be seen - presumably they have decamped to Sardinia, or Kefalonia). The whole place is 
In praise of staying put The Slow Lane
bathed in a serenity that otherwise can be experienced only for a few days around Christmas, or when there is a 
heavy snowfall.
Leaving London in late July and the first three weeks of August nowadays (this was not always the case) seems to 
me unnecessary. The weather is usually fine - we had a blazing July and are enjoying a lovely temperate August - 
and frankly far more pleasant than the unbearable heat of Andalucia or the burning, blowy Greek islands (better in 
May or September). The days are perfect for swimming in the Hampstead ponds (almost soupily warm this July) or 
in the Thames at Walton, bracing but not icy. This is the ideal time for picnics and even barbecues. The mildness of 
our climate means that it is hardly ever too hot for tennis - and the courts are empty - in fact rather too empty at our 
club - after the excitement of the July tournament.
You might think that everything grinds to a halt, culturally, in July and August. Certainly this is not the best time for 
theatre. But this is the Proms season in London, the time of the world's greatest and most democratic classical 
music festival. For almost two months you can pay just £5 to stand and stamp in the arena in proximity to some of 
the world's finest musicians, or to enjoy the different experience of chilling out in the gallery at the very top of the 
Royal Albert Hall, further removed from the action, and with peculiar acoustics.
I had the chance to enjoy two of our finest contemporary pianists (both London-based, as it happens): Stephen 
Hough displaying his refined, insouciant virtuosity in Rachmaninov and Lutoslawski on the first night, and Dame 
Mitsuko Uchida bringing her crystalline sound and spiritual depth to Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, with the 
magnificent Mariss Jansons conducting the brilliant Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.
Their performances could hardly have been more different but I reckon that it is as difficult to weight the chords as 
perfectly as Uchida did in the quiet, solo opening of the Beethoven as it is to bring off the fiendish cascades at the 
end of the Lutoslawski piece with Hough's sparkling panache. As for Jansons, he seems able to bring out a wider 
palette of sounds and colours from whichever orchestra he is conducting than any other contemporary conductor.
Even if you can't get to the Albert Hall, you can listen to the Proms on BBC Radio 3 in the comfort of your home or 
(if you have understanding neighbours) garden. Surely summer is the time to enjoy your home, not to abandon it. 
The other evening we sat out under the vine on two newly acquired fold-up garden chairs, at the rickety table I 
recently got around to repainting, sipping glasses of a venerable champagne, left forgotten in my father's cellar for 
decades, which had reached a perfect stage of golden richness.
Without thinking about it, we were following the advice of a poet who, 2,000 years ago, wrote of the pleasure of 
"drinking beneath the thick-leaved vine." That poet was Horace, patron of stay-at-homers - those who realise that 
"people who rush across oceans change only the colour of the sky, not their state of mind".
Horace was writing to a globe-trotting young friend, on a grand tour of the eastern Aegean and determined to visit 
every famous beauty spot. You can be sure that Horace himself had done all that as a young man; in middle age 
we know he still made the odd trip to the Bay of Naples. But on the whole he is happy to stay in his shady valley, 
where he has learnt to make friends with himself.

Airlines bore the brunt of share selling on Friday morning, pushing Britain's FTSE 100 towards a 2% loss in August, 
amid uncertainty over intervention in Syria and a weak report on German retail sales.
Equity markets across Europe and Asia declined, with the FTSE 100 heading for its fourth week in a row lower, 
down 39 points or 0.6% on the day to 6,446. The benchmark index is still up 10% year to date.
The move lower comes amid reports that the US is still prepared to move against Syria, even after British prime 
minister David Cameron failed to win parliamentary support for military strikes.
Brent crude oil futures had earlier fallen below $115 a barrel, to recover slightly higher at $115.18.
Traders also cited end-of-month bearishness, ongoing concerns over the end of US monetary stimulus and selling 
ahead of a long weekend in the US. A report showed that German retail sales dropped by 1.4% in July, marking the 
second consecutive drop.
Airlines among biggest losers The selling was broad-based in London, but airline shares, which have recently been 
hit by the rising oil price, fell hardest. Easyjet (EZJ.L)dropped nearly 3% to £12.23, while IAG (ICAG.L) was 2.3% 
lower at 285p. Dublin-listed Ryanair shares fell 2% to 6.48.
On the mid-cap index Bwin.Party (BPTY.L) fell 12% to111p as the online gambling company warned that full-year 
profits could be as much as 17% below 2012 levels.
Vodafone adds to gains Among only a handful of FTSE risers, Vodafone (VOD.L) gained another 0.4% to 205p, 
adding to yesterday's gains after the mobile phone company said it was in advanced talks with Verizon 
Communications to sell its 45% stake in their US joint venture Verizon Wireless for about $130 billion (£83.75 
billion).
Vodafone was unusually trading in larger volumes than Lloyds, the bank that almost always switches hands more 
than any other blue chip on any given day.
G4S (GFS.L) was the top Footsie riser, up 2% to 256p as investors continued to assess the embattled security 
group's move earlier this week to raise £348 million from leading shareholders.
FTSE slumps towards fourth straight weekly loss
Pound steady as house prices rise The British pound rose marginally, at $1.5516, amid more upbeat economic 
reports. Nationwide reported that house prices rose by 0.6% in August, while the British Chambers of Commerce 
upped its forecast for 2013 GDP growth to 1.3% from 0.9%.

Highlight: Airline to contest watchdog's decision
Body
UK regulators have ordered Ryanair to sell down its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to 5 per cent in a keenly 
anticipated ruling, against which the low-cost carrier vowed to appeal.
The budget airline will also be restricted from seeking or accepting board representation or acquiring further shares 
in Aer Lingus to protect competition on UK-Ireland routes.
The UK Competition Commission said in a ruling yesterday that Ryanair's minority stake in its rival "had led or may 
be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines on routes between Great Britain 
and Ireland".
It added: "Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy was likely to be affected by Ryanair's minority shareholding, 
in particular because it was likely to impede or prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by, or combining with 
another airline."
Ryanair accused the commission of making a "manifestly unjust ruling". Ryanair's shares fell 0.09 per cent to 
EUR6.51 yesterday.
The decision marks the latest blow delivered by regulators to Ryanair's attempt to control Aer Lingus , with which it 
competes in the Irish market. In February, Brussels blocked Ryanair's third bid in eight years to take over Aer 
Ryanair told to cut Aer Lingus stake to 5% TRAVEL & LEISURE
Lingus, ruling that the proposed transaction would increase fares for passengers and create a monopoly on 46 UK-
Ireland routes.
Simon Polito, deputy chairman of the commission, said there was a tension between Ryanair's position as a 
competitor and its position as Aer Lingus's largest shareholder.
"Ryanair has an incentive to weaken its rival's effectiveness as a competitor," he said. "Ryanair's minority 
shareholding affects Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy in various ways that could be crucial to Aer 
Lingus's future as a competitive airline.
"We were particularly concerned about Ryanair's ability, either directly or indirectly, to impede Aer Lingus from 
combining with another airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain competitive."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the commission's ruling was "bizarre and manifestly wrong". "This 
prejudicial approach to an Irish airline is very disturbing, coming from an English government body that regards 
itself a model competition authority."
Ryanair said that the UK ruling failed to accept the findings of a European Commission ruling issued in February 
2013, which it claimed found that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus had intensified since 2007.
The commission's failure to accept this finding would be the basis of its appeal, the airline said.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision. Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "It was unacceptable that our 
principal competitor was allowed to remain on our share register with a shareholding of 29.82 per cent and interfere 
with our business."
Ryanair will have to bring its appeal before the Competition Appeals Tribunal within four weeks.
The airline can ask the tribunal to suspend the commission's decision during the appeals process, which could take 
up to six months.
Analysts pointed out that if Ryanair pursued further appeals the process could take years.

Body
Consolidation is a fact of life in the airline industry. Scale provides carriers with cost and revenue synergies. This is 
one point on which low-cost carrier Ryanair and smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus agree. So is it right that the former, 
with a near-30 per cent stake in the latter yet barred from acquiring Aer Lingus for clear antitrust reasons, should be 
allowed to hinder its rival's chances of participating in this trend?
That, in a nutshell, is what yesterday's ruling by the UK Competition Commission requiring that most of the stake be 
sold comes down to. Aer Lingus is not an ailing carrier: it made EUR70m profit on sales of EUR1.4bn last year and 
holds a cash balance. But, as it admits, unit costs will rise over time, eroding competitiveness. By contrast, in the 
right corporate combination, it might enjoy material savings: the commission estimates possible cost synergies with 
a net present value of EUR60m-EUR100m on its UK/Ireland routes.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, of course, contends that his stake blocks nothing and has offered to sell it to any Aer 
Lingus bidder who secures control. But a babe in arms knows corporate relationships can be more nuanced than 
full ownership, particularly in sensitive sectors such as aviation. And it is easy to see why the brash low-cost 
carrier's presence could be a poison pill.
Ryanair will appeal against the sell-down. But the commission has said this remedy does not need to await the 
outcome of a separate legal challenge over the bar on a Ryanair merger in Luxembourg. So appeals may be limited 
to the English courts. That means a seven-year saga could, just could, end in months. Meanwhile, use of a minority 
stake to frustrate corporate strategy may have been highlighted at a time when EU antitrust regulators are 
reviewing their powers in this area. In that respect, at least, Mr O'Leary may have done everyone a favour.

THE COMPETITION Commission (CC) yesterday said it plans to force Ryanair to sell most of its stake in rival 
airline Aer Lingus, prompting a furious response from boss Michael O'Leary.
The CC said yesterday that Ryanair must sell its 29.8 per cent stake down to five per cent, confirming its finding in 
May that the shareholding posed a risk to competition on routes between the UK and Ireland.
"This report by the UK CC is bizarre and manifestly wrong but also entirely expected," O'Leary blasted yesterday. 
"This prejudicial approach to an Irish airline is very disturbing, coming from an English government body that 
regards itself a model competition authority."
Ryanair plans to appeal to the Competition Appeals Tribunal.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision.
"The Competition Commission should be commended on its thorough investigation and we look forward to the 
implementation of its findings," said chairman Colm Barrington.
The CC will wait for the outcome of Ryanair's appeal against a European Commission ruling on the same topic 
before imposing its remedies. Analysts said the process could take years.
The other hurdle for the sale is finding a buyer. O'Leary's company has offered to sell its stake to any firm willing to 
make a takeover bid for Aer Lingus - a proposal that has so far had no takers.
Etihad, which holds three per cent of Aer Lingus, has been a shareholder for more than a year without expressing 
interest in making a bid for the rest.
Ryanair hits out at order to sell Aer Lingus stake
Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, has itself made three attempts to take over Aer Lingus, 
having built up its stake between 2007 and 2009.
The Irish government, which is also seeking to dispose of its 25 per cent Aer Lingus holding, refused to sell out to 
Ryanair.

Earnings from two of France's blue-chip stocks were responsible for the best and one of the worst performances on 
pan-European stock indices.
Shares in Accor , Europe's largest hotel group, fell 4.4 per cent to EUR27.52 after the company warned on full-year 
profit after reporting weaker than expected first-half results.
The owner of the Novotel and Ibis chains said operating profit in its first six months had fallen 6.4 per cent to 
EUR198m, and forecast that full-year profit would come in at between EUR510m-EUR530m, just below market 
estimates of EUR535m.
"Even with significant help from the cost savings programme, Accor still expects full-year core earnings to be below 
last year," said Geof Collyer at Deutsche Bank.
At the other end of the FTSE Eurofirst 300 stood Bouygues , the conglomerate, up 10.5 per cent to EUR25.33 after 
it maintained its profit outlook following a 10 per cent rise in second-quarter operating profit to EUR432m, beating 
expectations. Overall market sentiment remained clouded by the sell-off in emerging markets and the Syrian crisis. 
The Eurofirst 300 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,198.56.
Among the top gainers, oil groups were prominent as the threat of international involvement in Syria drove up oil 
prices.

Spanish oil producer Repsol added 3.2 per cent to EUR18.11 while Norway's Statoil gained 4.2 per cent to

The sharp rise in oil prices hit shares in airlines. Lufthansa fell 3.2 per cent to EUR13.49 and Air France-KLM lost

Ryanair fell 0.1 per cent to EUR6.51 after the UK Competition Commission ordered the Dublin-based airline to cut

The ISEQ suffered a second day of declines as world markets braced for the effects of an imminent attack on Syria 
with the main Irish index also weighed by profit taking on Paddy Power.
The index was down 23.30 points to 4,114.79.
Ryanair stocks plunged 11c to E6.41 in morning trades before recovering to 1c down at E6.51 after Britain's 
competition watchdog ordered Ryanair to sell most of its stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus, a potentially fatal blow to 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary's dream of buying the former flag carrier. O'Leary immediately vowed to appeal 
against the "bizarre and manifestly wrong" order to cut Ryanair's stake to 5 percent from 30 percent, opening the 
prospect of a legal process that analysts say could last years. Echoing a ruling by the European Commission in 
February to block Ryanair's third bid to take over Aer Lingus, Britain's Competition Commission said Ryanair's 
stake could lead to "a substantial lessening of competition" on some routes. In addition to cutting the stake, the UK 
body ordered Ryanair not to seek additional shares or board representation.
Paddy Power shares fell 24c to E59.83 after it reported a pre-tax profit of E77 million for the first six months of the 
year, up 22pc on the same period of 2012. Diluted earnings per share are up 13pc to 137c. Revenue is up over 
20pc in constant currency with growth in every division, especially in the area of online and mobile. Net revenue 
there was up over 100pc to E104 million. Meanwhile the company's Australian operations are performing 
particularly well, with its operating profits up 25pc to E16.5 million. "The first-half numbers reported from Paddy 
Power today are broadly in line with our expectations, with the exception perhaps of a bigger-than-expected loss in 
the Italian start-up business. The issue though for the market today will not be the H1 numbers so much as the 
guidance provided by the company for the second half. Management is guiding to 11-15pc growth in EBIT on a 
constant currency basis. On a reported basis, that implies 7-11pc growth. Unfavourable sports results in the second 
half to date are the main cause of lowered guidance," said Davy Stockbrokers. Grafton shares rose 36c to E6.49

after it said that the group's H1 revenues rose 1pc year-on-year (yoy) to E1.07bn despite a foreign exchange 
headwind that knocked circa 2.5pc off turnover. H1 underlying trading profits rose 17pc to E36.6m, which was 4pc

Britain's competition watchdog today ordered Ryanair to cut its stake in smaller Irish rival Aer Lingus to 5 percent 
from 30 percent, saying the current arrangement had the potential to substantially reduce competition.
Ryanair said would appeal against what it described as a "bizarre and manifestly wrong" decision in a legal process 
that could last years.
Six months after the European Commission blocked Ryanair's third bid to takeover Aer Lingus, the decision 
appears to all but end Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's seven-year pursuit of Ireland's former flag carrier.
But appeals against both decisions mean Aer Lingus management is unlikely to quickly fulfil its ambition of getting 
Ryanair off the company's share register and replace it with institutional investors or a strategic partner. O'Leary 
has made three failed takeover bids for 75-year-old Aer Lingus in an attempt to cap the rise of his upstart airline that 
began with one 15-seater plane in 1985. Ryanair's low cost model has since come to dominate European aviation, 
carrying 77 million passengers last year compared with 9.5 million passengers at Aer Lingus. Having already written 
down the 407 million euros it paid for the Aer Lingus stake in 2007-2009 to 80 million euros, Ryanair could actually 
book a profit at the current share price, which would value the stake at around 270 million euros. However, it says 
no one has expressed an interest in buying it. Britain's Competition Commission ruled that Ryanair's shareholding 
had "led or may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines on routes 
between Great Britain and Ireland." Aer Lingus' commercial policy and strategy were likely to be affected by 
Ryanair's shareholding and it was likely to impede Aer Lingus from being acquired by another airline, it added. 
Ryanair said the ruling violated European law due to contradictions with recent findings of the European 
Commission and that it failed to acknowledge Ryanair's recent offer to unconditionally sell its minority stake to any 
other airline that secures Aer Lingus shareholder approval for a takeover bid. O'Leary said in a statement that 
Ryanair's lawyers would lodge a complaint to the competition appeal tribunal in the coming weeks. ( C ) Reuters

Britain's Competition Commission said Ryanair's stake could lead to "a substantial lessening of competition" on 
some routes.
In addition to cutting the stake, the UK body ordered Ryanair not to seek additional shares or board representation. 
The British watchdog claims jurisdiction over the Irish airlines due to 11 routes between Ireland and Britain where 
Ryanair flights compete with those of Aer Lingus or partner Aer Arann. Ryanair said the Competition Commission 
could not lawfully impose any remedies on Ryanair until the completion of Ryanair's appeal against the European 
Commission ruling. O'Leary built up a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus between 2007 and 2009 as a platform to take 
over the 75-year-old airline, a purchase that would have capped the rise of his upstart airline that began with one 
15-seater plane in 1985. Ryanair, whose low-cost model has since come to dominate European aviation, carried 
almost 80 million passengers last year compared with under 10 million at Aer Lingus, and O'Leary says a takeover 
would allow him to slash his rival's cost base. But the Competition Commission found the current ownership 
structure could limit Aer Lingus's ability to manage effectively its portfolio of Heathrow slots and could impede Aer 
Lingus from combining with another airline. While the two airlines currently impose a "strong competitive constraint" 
on each other, the report found that Ryanair would have the incentive to use its influence to weaken Aer Lingus's 
effectiveness as a competitor. O'Leary said in a statement the ruling violated European law due to contradictions 
with recent findings of the European Commission and that it failed to acknowledge Ryanair's recent offer to

British regional airline bmi, which was completed last year. Ryanair said its lawyers would lodge a complaint to 
Britain's competition appeal tribunal in the coming weeks. The appeals mean Aer Lingus management is unlikely to

Commission ruling. O'Leary built up a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus between 2007 and 2009 as a platform to take 
over the 75-year-old airline, a purchase that would have capped the rise of his upstart airline that began with one 
15-seater plane in 1985. Ryanair, whose low-cost model has since come to dominate European aviation, carried 
almost 80 million passengers last year compared with under 10 million at Aer Lingus, and O'Leary says a takeover 
would allow him to slash his rival's cost base. But the Competition Commission found the current ownership 
structure could limit Aer Lingus's ability to manage effectively its portfolio of Heathrow slots and could impede Aer 
Lingus from combining with another airline. While the two airlines currently impose a "strong competitive constraint" 
on each other, the report found that Ryanair would have the incentive to use its influence to weaken Aer Lingus's 
effectiveness as a competitor. O'Leary said in a statement the ruling violated European law due to contradictions 
with recent findings of the European Commission and that it failed to acknowledge Ryanair's recent offer to

unconditionally sell its minority stake to any other airline that secures Aer Lingus shareholder approval for a 
takeover bid. He accused the body of double standards for not blocking the purchase by British Airways owner of 
British regional airline bmi, which was completed last year. Ryanair said its lawyers would lodge a complaint to 
Britain's competition appeal tribunal in the coming weeks. The appeals mean Aer Lingus management is unlikely to 
quickly fulfil its ambition of getting Ryanair off the company's share register and replace it with institutional investors 
or a strategic partner. Having already written down the 407 million euros it paid for the Aer Lingus stake to 80 
million, Ryanair could book a profit at the current share price, which would value the stake at around 270 million 
euros. But it says no one has expressed an interest in buying it.

(RTTNews) - The U.K. regulators ordered Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) to sell down 
its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L) to 5 per cent. This will be accompanied by obligations on 
Ryanair not to seek or accept board representation or acquire further shares.
In its final report published, the regulators confirmed its provisional findings that Ryanair's minority shareholding had 
led or may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines on routes between 
Great Britain and Ireland.
Separately, Ryanair confirmed that it will appeal the UK Competition Commission or UKCC final report which 
wrongly found that Ryanair, through its 7 year old minority , 29.8%, shareholding in Aer Lingus, "had led or may be 
expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition between the airlines on routes between Great Britain and 
Ireland".
Ryanair also noted that the baseless claim was manifestly disproven by 7 years of evidence and by the European 
Commission's recent ruling that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has "intensified" since 2007.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is trading lower on Wednesday, as situation in Syria continues to cause concern amid 
reports that the U.S. may soon launch military action against the civil war-torn country.
While the U.S. made it clear that it is not contemplating any action aimed at a regime change in Syria, Defense 
Secretary Chuck Hagel said his forces were ready for any contingency involving Syria, and were awaiting a 
presidential order on any options.
Responding to reports that a U.S.-led strike on Syria is imminent, State Department deputy spokesperson Marie 
Harf said "any options that we're considering would be a response to the CW (chemical weapons) attack," and that 
"we're not contemplating any action that would be aimed at regime change."
Media reports quoting a senior U.S. official said the U.S. could hit Syria as early as Thursday. Some analysts say, if 
the strike happens, the U.S. could take a different form of strike from the Iraq War - may be using drones or 
missiles.
On the economic front, a survey by market research group GfK revealed that sentiment among German consumers 
is set to ease marginally heading into September after reaching a six year-high in August, with households 
expecting the economic recovery to be sluggish in the coming months.
The forward-looking consumer confidence indicator for September slipped to 6.9 from a six year high of 7 in August. 
The outcome defied expectations for an increase in the indicator to 7.1.
Eurozone's second quarter gross domestic product outcome confirmed the European Central Bank's outlook for the 
economy, ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen reportedly said. ECB expects a very slow recovery in 
economic activity in the second half of the year, which will continue to pick up in 2014.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is losing 0.49 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is falling 0.64 percent.
The FTSE 100 index is losing 0.4 percent currently.
Ryanair said it would appeal a ruling by the UK Competition Commission that the low-cost airline would be required 
to sell its 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus Group, down to 5 percent. Ryanair shares are losing 5.1 percent while 
Aer Lingus is declining 6.4 percent.
UK Market Declines
International Consolidated Airlines and easyJet are falling 6.1 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.
Polymetal International is plunging 16 percent after reporting a loss for the first half of the year.
G4S, which announced first-half results, is gaining 3.8 percent.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX, the French CAC 40 and Switzerland's SMI are firmly in the red. Across 
Asia/Pacific, markets closed firmly in negative territory.
In the U.S., futures point to a slightly higher open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks fell sharply as 
worries about the situation in Syria largely overshadowed a pair of economic reports showing a continued increase 
in home prices and an unexpected improvement in consumer confidence. The Dow slid 1.1 percent, the tech-heavy 
Nasdaq tumbled 2.2 percent and the S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent.
In the commodity space, crude for October delivery is gaining $0.98 to $109.99 per barrel and December gold is 
adding $5.8 to $1426.0 a troy ounce.

British competition authorities have ordered Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus, a ruling that could deal a fatal 
blow to Ryanair's 7-year campaign to acquire its main Irish rival.
Ryanair vowed to appeal Wednesday's judgment by the United Kingdom Competition Commission. Ryanair chief 
Michael O'Leary called it "bizarre."
The commission ordered Ryanair to reduce its 30 percent holding in Aer Lingus to 5 percent to eliminate what it 
described as Ryanair's ability to "impede or prevent" Aer Lingus' acquisition by any other airline.
Ryanair has launched three failed takeover bids since Ireland's government privatized the state-owned airline in 
2006.
Ryanair is Aer Lingus' largest shareholder, while the government has retained a 25 percent stake.
The government says it's willing to sell its shares, but not to Ryanair.

UK Watchdog Asks Ryanair To Cut Aer Lingus Stake To 5%, Airline To Appeal
UK Watchdog Asks Ryanair To Cut Aer Lingus Stake To 5%, Airline To 
Appeal

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Wednesday said it would appeal a ruling by the UK 
Competition Commission that the low-cost airline would be required to sell its 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus 
Group Plc. (AERL.L), down to 5 percent.
The Competition Commission or CC, in its final report published today, confirmed its provisional findings that 
Ryanair's minority shareholding had led or may be expected to lead to a substantial reduction of competition 
between the airlines on routes between Great Britain and Ireland.
The CC said the stake reduction would be accompanied by obligations on Ryanair not to seek or accept board 
representation or acquire more shares.
The CC is of the view Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy was likely to be affected by Ryanair's minority 
shareholding. This was likely to impede or prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by, or combining with another 
airline, the watchdog noted.
The CC was also concerned that Ryanair's stake was likely to affect Aer Lingus's commercial policy and strategy by 
allowing Ryanair to block special resolutions, restricting Aer Lingus's ability to issue shares and raise capital and to 
limit Aer Lingus's ability to manage effectively its portfolio of Heathrow slots.
Ryanair's shareholding also had increased the likelihood of the airline mounting further bids for Aer Lingus.
Noting that Ryanair and Aer Lingus compete intensely for passengers traveling between Great Britain and Ireland, 
to the benefit of passengers, the CC said there is a tension between Ryanair's position as a competitor and its 
position as Aer Lingus's largest shareholder, and that Ryanair has an incentive to weaken its rival's effectiveness as 
a competitor.
''We were particularly concerned about Ryanair's ability, either directly or indirectly, to impede Aer Lingus from 
combining with another airline to build scale and achieve synergies to remain competitive,'' Simon Polito, CC 
Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus Inquiry Group, said.
Polito said Ryanair proposed various remedies to address the CC's specific concerns. But the Competition 
Commission believes that in a dynamic and uncertain sector such as the airline industry, it is inherently difficult to 
design remedies that would cater for all eventualities.
UK Watchdog Asks Ryanair To Cut Aer Lingus Stake To 5%, Airline To Appeal
The Ryanair/Aer Lingus Inquiry Group included Simon Polito, Roger Davis, Carolan Dobson and Professor Michael 
Waterson.
The CC concluded that the effective and proportionate remedy that would address its concerns was to require a 
partial divestment of Ryanair's shareholding to 5 percent, facilitated by the appointment of a Divestiture Trustee.
Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are Irish airlines. Ryanair had initially acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in late 2006. The 
company made two unsuccessful bids for Aer Lingus's remaining shares.
Ryanair's latest bid, made in July 2012, was prohibited by the European Commission in February and the airline 
lodged an appeal with the General Court against this decision in May.
The airline said it would appeal the ruling of the CC, saying it invented ''concerns'' in desperate attempt to justify 
pre-determined ruling.
Regarding competition, Ryanair said the European Commission recently ruled that competition between Ryanair 
and Aer Lingus has "intensified" since 2007. ''Under EU law, the UKCC has a duty of sincere cooperation with the 
EU, and cannot contradict or reach different conclusions to the European Commission's findings,'' the airline said.
Further, Ryanair said the CC has inexplicably dismissed its remedies. For example, the watchdog rejected 
Ryanair's offer to unconditionally sell its minority stake to any other airline that makes a bid for Aer Lingus and 
obtains acceptances from 50.1 percent of Aer Lingus' shareholders.
Ryanair also offered to support Aer Lingus' rights issues and any disposal of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots, but these 
remedies were rejected by the UKCC.
The airline believes that the CC did not conduct any fair investigation and that it has now merely announced what 
was its pre-determined conclusion.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said,'' "This report by the UKCC is bizarre and manifestly wrong but also entirely 
expected. From the first meeting with the UKCC it has been clear to us that Simon Polito's and Roger Davis' minds 
had been made up in advance and no truth or evidence was going to get in the way of their story.''
''This prejudicial approach to an airline is very disturbing, coming from an English government body that regards 
itself a model competition authority,'' O'Leary added.
Further, the company said Ryanair is one of the UK's largest airlines while Aer Lingus has a tiny presence in the 
UK, serving just 6 routes to the Republic of Ireland, accounting for less than 1 percent of all UK air traffic.
''This case, involving two Irish airlines where one (Aer Lingus) accounts for less than 1% of the UK's total air traffic 
and concerns very few UK consumers, is yet another enormous waste of UK taxpayer resources from a body which 
took no action whatsoever when the two main UK airlines (BA and bmi) merged. It would appear to be a case of 
one rule for the UK airlines but an invented set of rules for two Irish airlines,'' Ryanair said.
RYA.L is currently losing nearly 2 percent in early morning trade at 6.39 pence.

British Airways owner IAG , this year's top-performing FTSE 100 stock, led the London market lower as rising fuel 
costs led investors to book profits.
IAG lost 4.8 per cent to 300.5p as the threat of a US-led military intervention against Syria lifted jet fuel prices to a 
six-month high.
ICE European gas oil futures, a benchmark for jet fuel, have jumped by about 17 per cent since mid-April.
"While jet fuel pricing has stabilised somewhat after a seemingly unstoppable rise between 2009 and 2011, the 
recent rise in jet fuel prices . . . are still cause for concern and a severe headwind to airlines' profitability," said 
Investec Securities.
Cutting IAG from its "buy" list, Investec was also concerned that industry supply would outstrip demand. With IAG 
up 63 per cent so far this year, and pressure growing on both premium and short-haul yields, the chances of further 
outperformance were limited, said the broker.
It favoured easyJet , down 2.5 per cent to £12.34, and Ryanair , off 3.6 per cent to EUR6.52.
Travel stocks led the wider market lower, leading the FTSE 100 down 0.8 per cent, or 51.13 points, to 6,440.97.

Tui Travel fell 3.8 per cent to 343.9p and Thomas Cook lost 8.5 per cent to 136.1p, while cruise operator Carnival 
was down 1.1 per cent to £24.83. Precious metals miners helped counterbalance the FTSE as Syrian tensions 
pushed gold to its highest since June, with Fresnillo up 7.1 per cent to £13.10 and Randgold Resources firmer by 
4.1 per cent to £53.35.
But Polymetal dropped 8.5 per cent to 741p a day before interim results, which were expected to show rising costs 
and a sharp fall in earnings on lower prices.
Among the gainers, Petrofacrallied 8.5 per cent to £13.73 after its interim results beat expectations and came with 
an unexpectedly positive outlook.
Marks and Spencer took on 1.6 per cent to 479.1p after Citigroup turned positive.
Four years of investment in M&S's general merchandise IT and supply chain systems will pay off next year, 
delivering like-for-like sales growth after eight quarters of declines, said Citi.
"The combination of recent, material upgrades to UK economic growth forecasts and M&S management initiatives 
have markedly improved the credibility of double-digit 2015 and 2016 EPS growth forecasts," Citi said.
Fellow retailer Next advanced 1.5 per cent to £49.90 on an upgrade to "buy" from Merrill Lynch, which put a £55 
price target on the stock.
Premier Foods was up 9.5 per cent to 135.8p after Credit Suisse upgraded to "outperform" with a 155p target.
With the Hovis and Bisto owner stabilised, Premier could raise between £250m and 300m with a rights issue, said 
analyst Charlie Mills
"Valuing a business that is structurally overindebted where profit expectations are falling is nigh on impossible - a 
deteriorating profit outlook simply crushes the equity value," he said.
"However, if the profits have stabilised and can even show some growth, then the reverse is true - the equity 
leverage into a profit upturn is material."

Are entrepreneurs freaks of nature? Jim Clifton thinks so. He is the boss of research firm Gallup, and recently wrote 
about studies it is undertaking to find those especially talented individuals who can build the next Google, Ryanair 
or Bloomberg.
Gallup estimated that such "super-entrepreneurs" number just three out of 1,000 across a sample population. 
These are the risk-takers capable of founding so-called gazelle companies: the fastest-growing breakthrough 
organisations that create a high proportion of the new jobs and genuine innovation in an economy.
Identifying these prime movers is incredibly difficult. It is not like spotting brilliant footballers or pianists, where there 
are exams, courses, teachers and systems to discover and cultivate rare prowess. However, the skills displayed by 
the next Steve Jobs or Sir James Dyson are more complex and less well understood. They involve an ability to 
organise and promote a business, make a commercial idea concrete, hire and lead a team, generate sales and add 
value. There can be no academic qualification for attributes such as inventiveness or a spirit of enterprise.
It is a tragedy that the economics profession almost ignores this subject, and that business schools have done so 
little useful work to identify key character traits of the vital few. Venture capitalists would have much to gain by 
undertaking serious scientific studies into the personalities of winners in business. But they seem resigned to the 
idea that there are few rules or systems for finding the right ones to back.
The small start-ups are as vital as the stars
Scott Shane, a prolific writer on entrepreneurship, postulates that genetic factors are powerful determinants of 
whether someone will develop a successful business. His book Born Entrepreneurs, Born Leaders suggests innate, 
inheritable predispositions really matter.
A survey of entrepreneurs at Northeastern University supports his view: 61 per cent of respondents said innate 
drive was the main reason they started a business: only 1 per cent said their higher education was a significant 
factor.
Not everyone buys the idea that a small number of extraordinary risk-takers are the ones who make a difference, 
however. Mass Flourishing , an important new book by Nobel prizewinner Edmund Phelps, suggests individuals 
matter much less than overall culture and social values. The subtitle of his text is "How grassroots innovation 
created jobs, challenge, and change". His thesis is that most industrial discoveries were not pioneered by a few 
isolated visionaries, such as Henry Ford. Instead, he argues that progress was driven by huge numbers of citizens 
empowered to create and sell thousands of incremental improvements, from craftsmen and farmers to traders and 
factory workers. Together they generated an extraordinary period of prosperity, starting in the 1820s in Britain and 
petering out in the 1970s in the US.
Now, in the west, Professor Phelps believes there is a sense that the "glorious history of desire and dreams" has 
run out of steam. Unquestionably, there is an unholy alliance of conservatism and socialism that impedes economic 
and technological advances by resisting innovation.
In Britain, for instance, whether it is fracking, immigration, reforming the state or genetically modified foods, we 
suffer from neurotic environmentalists and Nimby elements who object to change and are deaf to rational 
arguments. They defy modernity, and seek to embrace what they imagine are "traditional" values. So they resent 
wealth creation, cling to bloated welfare and pension systems, resist new developments and so forth. By contrast, 
Prof Phelps shows how in the 19th and 20th centuries Britain and the US, among other nations, were dynamic and 
open to novelty - and that the good life was surprisingly inclusive then.
I agree with him that all entrepreneurship is important, not just the famous names. I also think that government, 
industry, regulators and institutions must be more venturesome if a nation is to compete successfully in a global 
marketplace. Meanwhile, educators, mentors, universities and philanthropists should explore much more deeply 
why certain entrepreneurs have such an impact, how to breed more of them, and how to encourage surroundings 
that will enable them to flourish.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is set for disappointment this morning when the Competition Commission tells the 
airline how much of its near-30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus it must sell off. The CC said in May that the holding 
"could reduce competition on routes between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland". Ryanair has already 
offered to sell the stake to any firm that wants to bid for Aer Lingus.

Italy's FTSE MIB underperformed the broader pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 yesterday after renewed political 
uncertainty hit the country's share market.
The implications of Silvio Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud and his political party's response have sparked 
concerns of a period of uncertainty that could threaten the ruling coalition.
Italian government debt prices fell, pushing yields higher on the 10-year bonds by 1.1 basis points to 4.33 per cent.
The FTSE Eurofirst ended flat at 1,223.52, while the FTSE MIB index fell 2.1 per cent to 16,977.76. Shares in 
former prime minister Berlusconi's business empire were among the worst hit. Mediaset , the Berlusconi-controlled 
broadcaster, publisher and advertising group, fell 6.3 per cent to EUR3.15.
Banks were also sharply lower, with UniCredit down 3.5 per cent to EUR4.42 and Intesa Sanpaolo off 3.3 per cent 
to EUR1.51.
Shares in KPN gained 3 per cent to EUR2.33 after América Móvil, which owns 30 per cent in the Dutch telecoms 
group, gave its backing to the sale of KPN's German unit E-Plus to Telefónica Deutschland.
Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire who owns América Móvil, gave an "irrevocable commitment" to vote in favour of 
the sale after Telefónica sweetened its bid to EUR8.55bn from its initial EUR8.1bn offer.
Italian stocks hit by Berlusconi verdict EUROPE
Ryanair , the Irish budget airline, eased 0.8 per cent to EUR6.71 in Dublin after regulatory authorities in the UK said 
they were considering the company's stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group.
The Competition Commission may force Ryanair to sell all or part of its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus after it 
said earlier in the year that the market for flights between Ireland and the UK was distorted because of the holding.
Shares in French drugmaker Sanofi were helped by the results of a clinical trial that showed its Fluzone High-Dose 
vaccine was more effective at treating influenza in elderly patients than its standard dose Fluzone treatment.
Shares in Sanofi rose 2.3 per cent to EUR76.65.

Battle for Irish workers' rights reopens old wounds

Body
In a dingy tenement in Dublin, a worker washes blood off his face after a clash with police at a trade union picket 
line.
"They kept hitting him till the blood ran from his head," he cries out to his impoverished family after witnessing his 
friend being beaten to death.
This is not a sudden outburst of civil disorder in Ireland. It is a scene from Living the Lockout , a play 
commemorating the centenary of the worst industrial dispute in Irish history - the Dublin lockout of 1913. For five 
months 20,000 workers battled employers for the right to trade union recognition. They eventually returned to work 
without getting what they wanted.
A century later Irish unions are once again fighting for the right to negotiate on behalf of workers in a bitter 
campaign that threatens to split the ruling Fine Gael/Labour coalition.
"Ireland is almost unique in Europe in not recognising collective bargaining rights," says Shay Cody, general 
secretary of Impact, Ireland's second-biggest trade union.
"This enables employers like Intel and Ryanair to take the same approach to workers' freedom of association today 
as employers did during the lockout."
Battle for Irish workers' rights reopens old wounds
Dublin has been praised by its eurozone partners for maintaining social cohesion and industrial peace while 
implementing cuts and tax rises worth EUR28.5bn since its financial crisis struck in 2008. It recently agreed a deal 
with trade unions in the public sector, which aims to cut pay and introduce new work practices.
Under Irish law, workers are free to join unions but employers do not have to negotiate with them. This legal point 
was confirmed in 2007 when the Irish airline Ryanair won a case at the Irish Supreme Court, defending its right to 
be a non-unionised company.
Unions are pressing the government to legislate for collective bargaining before the end of 2013. They argue 
European case law and the charter of fundamental rights - which was recently enshrined into European Union 
treaties - means Ireland is in breach of EU law.
"Freedom of association is meaningless unless there is some element of collective bargaining," says David Begg, 
general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions - an umbrella group representing unions. "If the 
government fails to act, a legal challenge is the logical end game."
Unions are emboldened by a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights in 2008. They claim that the 
judgment in Demir and Baykara v Turkey showed that the European Convention on Human Rights upholds the right 
to collective bargaining.
But employers say Irish labour laws provide the necessary rights and protection for employees and that any 
meddling with the voluntary system of industrial relations currently in place could cost jobs.
"The flexibility of the Irish labour system is a . . . key reason so many foreign companies choose to locate here," 
says Danny McCoy, chief executive of the employers group Ibec.
US multinationals based in Ireland , which directly employ 115,000 people, are at the forefront of lobbying against 
any changes to the voluntary system of union recognition. The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland says 
changing the system would "damage the capacity to attract and retain inward investment" in the country.
Dublin has pledged to address the issue to "ensure compliance by the state with recent judgments of the ECHR". 
But there are signs of mounting tension between the centre-right Fine Gael party and the centre-left Labour party, 
which has union links.
Richard Bruton, Ireland's minister for enterprise, told the Small Firms Association conference in June that any new 
system of collective bargaining introduced by the government would remain voluntary.
But as events commemorating the 1913 lockout begin in earnest this week in Dublin, the campaign to win union 
recognition is intensifying.
"On the 100th anniversary of the lockout, we have to deliver on the commitment in the programme for government," 
says Kevin Humphreys, a Labour member of parliament.

How to tackle the pension crisis How about a simple #10: Dispense with "pension" and its unfortunate baggage 
generated over many years and replace with retirement savings plan (RSP)? - ANF65, via FT.com/money
Nest [National Employment Savings Trust] is going to be the equivalent of Ryanair. No one will want to use it unless 
they are really desperate. The charges are higher than typical company-sponsored arrangements, their investment 
strategy is hugely in favour of bonds and it is never going to be free of government intervention. The main problem 
to address is to save more - be it in pensions or elsewhere. British people save less than 1 per cent of their income. 
You are not going to achieve much in return for that! - msrbuka, via FT.com/money
With regard to remedy 1, increasing the pension age is simply not equivalent to working longer. If the pension age 
is put up to 70, you might have to work for an additional 5 to 10 years in order to stay solvent, but you have to find 
work to do, and that is the problem. Many employers not only don't want older staff, but actively seek to dismiss 
those over 55. Many of my colleagues have been made redundant in their 50s and 60s and will never get a "proper" 
job again. There has always been a career black hole between about 50 and 60 for many, where one is too old to 
be employed, but too young to draw the pension. It now seems that this hole is going to double in size, resulting in 
much hardship in late middle age for many. - Nuages0, via FT.com/money
Via National Savings, the government should provide an inflation-linked pension savings scheme that has no 
charges or tax so that people can be absolutely certain that their savings will match inflation. The government must 
actually put the cash in, not just promise to pay, and the fund must not be used for clever accounting such as

reducing the national debt. Easy, and it takes away a lot of the complexity people feel when investing in stock 
markets, etc - jbx, via FT.com/money
 "It is among the most frail that life expectancy is rising fastest. Those aged 85 and over rose by 26 per cent."  This 
is one of the most severe problems, from a financial point of view, as these people also generate maximum health 
costs. - MrXY, via FT.com/money
 Serious Money: Your property is not your pension Well said, Jonathan. I met a friend of mine for a drink the 
other day and he told me about his fantastic BTL [Buy to Let] investment. He was happy to talk about the figures 
and when we worked it out his gross yield of 5 per cent went to 0 per cent after the mortgage and costs. If interest 
rates rise and the rental income does not, he's going to lose. He's banking on house prices going up above inflation 
each year. It may work but I'd rather have a Plan B as well. - Raymondo7, via FT.com/money
The answer here is that it does not matter what you do. Even if you spread your risk across a number of asset 
types, in a crisis the powers-that-be will take from the winners to look after the losers. Such is the reality of a fair 
society. Why did we pay into Serps all those years? - CliMcChange, via FT.com/money
 Alphaville: Puppet master's global network Thanks. I think all this offshore stuff is very interesting. I raised this 
with a Canary Wharf-based UK bank a couple of years who laughed at my naivete and said "Oh, the UK 
government would never do anything about offshore. The City of London and the government benefit so much from 
all this." - Super SWF, via FT.com/alphaville 
 Merryn Somerset Webb: Why suffer current account incompetence? Why suffer monthly fees? If you want to 
be cute, keep switching and collecting the £100 sign-up reward that is usually available from some bank or other. 
When I switched a couple of years ago, there was the inevitable mess-up with the direct debits and a couple of 
credit card companies were not paid on time. Both banks blamed each other. This is OK if you don't mind this sort 
of messing around. Otherwise, find a good bank and stick to it. - groberts, via FT.com/money

Northern airports to offer flights across Atlantic

Direct transatlantic flights will be offered from smaller regional airports in the north of the UK for the first time next 
spring, in a test of interest that could lead to the provision of regular services.
Flights to New York, Boston and Toronto main airports will be provided from Newcastle, Leeds Bradford and 
Glasgow airports in April by Jet2, which focuses on providing low-fare flights to leisure passengers flying from the 
Midlands and further north.
The airline said it would trial a handful of flights from the three airports in response to demand, and if successful, 
would introduce the services permanently to its schedule and consider more destinations.
In November, the airline ran flights to New York from regional airports to gauge passenger interest, which it said 
had attracted great demand and had been entirely booked up.
Limited numbers of direct flights to the US are already offered from larger regional UK airports such as Manchester 
and Edinburgh.
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has said for years that it wants to provide cheap transatlantic flights, which would be 
provided by a subsidiary, although it has no immediate plans to do so.
Northern airports to offer flights across Atlantic
"Regional airports, unlike Heathrow and Gatwick, don't have direct connections to these places," said Steve Heapy, 
Jet2 chief executive.
"People don't always want to travel via Schiphol or Charles de Gaulle - we want to give people from the regions the 
chance to fly direct."
Mr Heapy said the airline would remain focused on the north of the UK.
"We concentrate on the northern markets, we're run by northern people and we understand it because we all live 
here," he said.

From Mr Paul Tweed.
Sir, I write on behalf of my client Ryanair to set the record straight in relation to your article headlined " Ryanair 
pilots raise safety concerns " (FT.com August 11).
The Pilot Group referred to in your article is controlled by an interim council comprised of KLM, Aer Lingus, 
Southwest and Air France pilots and trade union leaders. These individuals work not for Ryanair but for their 
competitor airlines, and so they are not representative of Ryanair's over 3,000 pilots. Indeed, their press releases 
confirm that they are a PR front for pilot unions of Ryanair's competitor airlines.
Ryanair has an industry-leading 29-year safety record, complies with all European and national legislation, and the 
independent Irish Aviation Authority (which is subject to rigorous oversight by the European Aviation Safety Agency 
and the International Civil Aviation Organisation) has recently confirmed that Ryanair's safety is "on a par with the 
safest airlines in Europe".

Pilot groups on Facebook rouse Ryanair to reaction
Ryanair has gone on the offensive over social media sites used by pilot groups that it claims misuse its intellectual 
property.
The Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) - which bills itself as having been "created by pilots for pilots" - says it has started a 
new Facebook page since its original account was closed by the firm, which cited complaints the RPG was 
misusing Ryanair intellectual property.
RPG tells Flight International it has asked Facebook to clarify the reasons for taking the site down, as it has yet to 
receive a precise explanation.
Meanwhile, RPG's Twitter account has also been restarted after the group agreed to add a statement saying that it 
has no formal connections with Ryanair, which does not recognise a pilot union or negotiating body.
Ryanair says: "We are currently applying to obtain all 'Ryanair' pages on all relevant social media outlets in order to 
prevent internet trolls masquerading as Ryanair.
"We don't comment on the Non-Ryanair Pilots Group, which is a PR front for the pilot unions of competitor airlines."
Meanwhile, Ireland's aviation regulator has sharply criticised a documentary on British television that made a 
number of allegations about Ryanair.
The programme, aired on 12 August, was "a misguided attack on the regulation of a low-cost carrier", says the Irish 
Aviation Authority. Information used in the Channel 4 programme "may undermine the travelling public's confidence 
in civil air transport in Europe, which, because of the intensive regulatory regime, remains the safest mode of mass 
transport", adds the agency.

Italian banks led on panEuropean bourses as yields on the country's government debt fell.
Italy's 10-year yield dropped 3.9 basis points to 4.24 per cent yesterday, taking its premium over the equivalent 
benchmark German Bund to its lowest in two years.
Italian banks are big holders of domestic bonds and the ever-diminishing likelihood of default attracted investors to 
the sector.
Intesa Sanpaolo climbed 6.4 per cent to EUR1.60 yesterday and was one of the best performers over the week, 
climbing 7.4 per cent. UniCredit climbed 1.7 per cent to EUR4.78 yesterday and was up 3.9 per cent over the 
week.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,231.43 yesterday, giving it a weekly gain of 0.2 per cent.
Airlines were among the biggest fallers over the week. Lufthansa , the German carrier, fell 4.2 per cent to 
EUR14.20 after it was downgraded by Morgan Stanley.
Smaller rival Air Berlin shed 1.5 per cent to EUR1.97 after it warned on annual profits.
Ryanair fell 7.8 per cent to EUR6.64 after pilots employed by the Irish budget airline called for an inquiry into 
employment practices and their impact on safety.

Among the best gainers this week was Subsea 7 , the oilfield services group.
Shares in Subsea climbed 7.1 per cent to NKr121.30 over the five sessions after it reported record orders and 
forecast strong future profits.
Subsea's optimism helped buoy a sector that has had little reason for cheer in recent weeks.

Standard Life was under pressure yesterday on fears that its flagship fund was becoming unwieldy.
The life insurer is too reliant on its £17bn Global Absolute Return Strategies fund, which is "becoming a victim of its 
own success", Barclays argued. Strong performances in 2009 and 2010 have powered inflows but investment gains 
since then have been tougher to achieve, with June of this year its second-worst month on record, the broker noted.
The resignation last month of Euan Munro, architect of the GARS fund, would also encourage investors to pull cash 
out, argued Barclays. Mr Monro's exit led Hargreaves Lansdown to remove GARS from its influential Wealth 150 list 
of recommended funds.
Schroders' flagship UK Alpha fund suffered the same fate last year when portfolio manager Richard Buxton 
resigned.
Standard Life Investments provides 16 per cent of group operating profit yet the shares trade on par with asset 
managers at 14 times 2014 earnings, rather than the rating of 11 times earnings given to life insurers, said 
Barclays.
"In reality, it is a life insurer with an average asset manager," the broker argued. It put a 311.5p target on Standard 
Life shares, which slid 0.9 per cent to 346.2p.
Standard Life slips on fund fears; LONDON
The wider market edged higher, with the FTSE 100 recovering from a five-week low to add 16.65 points or 0.3 per 
cent to 6,499.99. For the week the index was down 1.3 per cent, its biggest weekly decline since June.
Travel stocks were among yesterday's fallers after both Thomas Cook and Tui cancelled trips to Egyptian resorts 
from Germany. Tui Travel lost 0.9 per cent to 359.4p and Ryanair was down 1.5 per cent to EUR6.62.
UBS cut Thomas Cook, up 0.2 per cent to 146.3p, from its preferred list of travel stocks. While Egypt only 
accounted for 5-7 per cent of its programme and the financial impact for the year will be minimal, the high-profile 
press coverage was likely to keep the stock under pressure, it said.
Housebuilders broke a five-day losing streak ahead of results next week from Persimmon , the month's worst blue-
chip performer. Its shares bounced 8.3 per cent to £11.88 while Bovis Homes was ahead 7.6 per cent to 778.5p, 
Bellway added 6.5 per cent to £14.25 and Taylor Wimpey took on 6.5 per cent to 108.3p.
Balfour Beatty advanced 8.7 per cent to 245.7p after an upgrade from "sell" to "buy" from Liberum Capital. 
Investors should write off an "awful" 2013 as irrelevant as the disposals and corrective measures taken will 
significantly improve prospects for 2014, Liberum argued. "Analysts have capitulated just when 'discontinueds' and 
kitchen sinking make future profits more achievable," the broker said. "The shares offer some of the best margin 
recovery potential in the sector and exposure to the early cycle US."
Miners followed metal prices higher, with copper at a 10-week high and gold heading for its biggest weekly gain in a 
month. Randgold Resources added 5.3 per cent to £51.50 and Polymetal was up 9 per cent to 783.5p, while 
Glencore rose 2.2 per cent to 308.4p.
A Merrill Lynch upgrade to "buy" lifted ITV 2.2 per cent to 160p. Strong UK retail sales data and an improving 
housing market suggest the risk to advertising is on the upside for 2014, it said.
Anite faded 6.9 per cent to 117p after the handset testing software maker repeated full-year guidance having made 
a relatively slow start to the year.
Frank Timis's African Minerals , the Sierra Leone iron ore miner, lost 2.9 per cent to 202p after Barclays advised 
selling.

Ryanair has sacked and will sue a long-serving pilot over his involvement in a Channel 4 documentary that 
questioned the airline's policy on safety and fuel.
Captain John Goss, who has been with Ryanair for 27 years, had been dismissed for "gross misconduct" and was 
being sued for defamation.
In a statement to RTE, the airline said: "We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national 
television just three weeks after he confirmed in writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety and no 
reason to make any confidential safety report to either the IAA or Ryanair."
Capt Goss was the only Ryanair pilot to be identified on the documentary. The programme featured a survey 
carried out by the Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) of 1,000 pilots. An overwhelming majority of them did not believe that 
Ryanair had an open and transparent safety culture. Capt Goss expressed concern, not only about Ryanair's safety 
culture, but also about the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). He said Ryanair pilots did not have confidence in the safety 
regulators. He was due to retire in October.

XXXX Travellers face the cancellation of Aer Lingus regional flights in Ireland and Britain next week because of a 
strike threat at Aer Arann, which actually operates the services. Aer Arann pilots yesterday served notice on the 
airline that they intend to strike over four days next week in the latest round of hostilities in a row over a pay freeze 
at the company. Pilots have voted in favour of a motion for industrial action after an independent tribunal, chaired by 
Kevin Foley of the Labour Relations Commission, failed to resolve the deadlock last month. If the strike, proposed 
for Tuesday and Wednesday and Saturday and Sunday of next week, goes ahead, it will result in Aer Lingus's 
regional flights being cancelled on those days. The Irish Times XXXX Toll traffic is declining across southern 
Europe as economic austerity forces cost-conscious drivers off the roads. Road charging companies in Spain, 
Portugal and Italy all reported drops in traffic in the six months until the end of June, as constrained household 
budgets saw more drivers stay at home, according to credit rating agency Moody's. "The archetypal trip is of the 
guy in Portugal with a house on the coast - but he is going there less," said Andrew Blease, an associate managing 
director at Moody's. "That is due to declining personal expenditure as austerity hits the pockets of consumers and 
feeds through into discretionary travel." The decline in car travel in particular has surprised some analysts, while 
trucks and heavy-goods vehicles have also been hit by dips in economic production The Irish Times XXXX 
Economic data due to be released tomorrow is expected to show that the single currency's economy edged back to

growth in the second quarter after six quarters of contraction. The economists believe that a year of relative calm on 
financial markets, budget cuts and economic reforms from Spain to Italy, and accelerating growth in the US, have 
helped the euro area start to recover from a downturn that pushed unemployment to a record 12.1pc. The Irish 
Independent XXXX Swedish furniture giant Ikea is spending E16m to build a windfarm in Leitrim in a move to 
ensure all power for its outlets in Dublin and Belfast is sourced from renewable energy. The company has teamed 
up with Irish energy firm Mainstream Renewable Power, the global energy firm headed by Eddie O'Connor. 
Mainstream will construct and operate the windfarm at Carrickeeny in north-west Leitrim on behalf of Ikea, which 
will sell the power from the farm to energy company Vayu. In turn, Vayu will supply electricity to Ikea under a 15-
year contract. The energy company will ensure that Ikea's power requirement in Ireland is always sourced from 
wind energy. The Irish Independent XXXX Diageo is rolling out a new version of its Baileys cream liqueur concocted 
by the son of the drink's original inventor. The company behind Guinness unveiled the drink in London yesterday as 
it revealed that it paid its former boss more than £14.7m (E17m) in the company's most recent financial year. 
According to its annual report, Diageo paid Paul Walsh a basic salary of £1.3m (E1.5m) in the year to the end of 
June. While that was unchanged on the previous year, he also received a bonus of £1.2m and another £12.2m in 
long-term bonuses based on the company's share price. Diageo has a hand in nearly every drinks sector on the 
planet. Apart from Guinness and Baileys, it also counts Smithwicks, Bushmills whiskey, Johnnie Walker whisky and 
Smirnoff Vodka among its many brands. The Irish Independent

Body
A Channel 4 Dispatches documentary last night alleged Ryanair aircraft frequently flew with the minimum of fuel 
and that the cockpit voice recordings relating to many serious incidents disappeared.
Ryanair hit back after the programme, describing it as "false and defamatory" and that it "wrongly impugned" the 
airline's 29-year "excellent" safety record. It said the IAA, which monitors Ryanair's safety record, conclusively 
disproves "false claims about Ryanair's fuel policy and/or Ryanair's outstanding safety record".
The Irish Times
XXXX Travellers face the cancellation of Aer Lingus regional flights in Ireland and Britain next week because of a 
strike threat at Aer Arann, which actually operates the services. Aer Arann pilots yesterday served notice on the 
airline that they intend to strike over four days next week in the latest round of hostilities in a row over a pay freeze 
at the company. Pilots have voted in favour of a motion for industrial action after an independent tribunal, chaired by 
Kevin Foley of the Labour Relations Commission, failed to resolve the deadlock last month. If the strike, proposed 
for Tuesday and Wednesday and Saturday and Sunday of next week, goes ahead, it will result in Aer Lingus's 
regional flights being cancelled on those days. The Irish Times XXXX Toll traffic is declining across southern 
Europe as economic austerity forces cost-conscious drivers off the roads. Road charging companies in Spain, 
Portugal and Italy all reported drops in traffic in the six months until the end of June, as constrained household 
budgets saw more drivers stay at home, according to credit rating agency Moody's. "The archetypal trip is of the 
guy in Portugal with a house on the coast - but he is going there less," said Andrew Blease, an associate managing 
director at Moody's. "That is due to declining personal expenditure as austerity hits the pockets of consumers and 
feeds through into discretionary travel." The decline in car travel in particular has surprised some analysts, while 
trucks and heavy-goods vehicles have also been hit by dips in economic production The Irish Times XXXX

growth in the second quarter after six quarters of contraction. The economists believe that a year of relative calm on 
financial markets, budget cuts and economic reforms from Spain to Italy, and accelerating growth in the US, have 
helped the euro area start to recover from a downturn that pushed unemployment to a record 12.1pc. The Irish 
Independent XXXX Swedish furniture giant Ikea is spending E16m to build a windfarm in Leitrim in a move to 
ensure all power for its outlets in Dublin and Belfast is sourced from renewable energy. The company has teamed 
up with Irish energy firm Mainstream Renewable Power, the global energy firm headed by Eddie O'Connor. 
Mainstream will construct and operate the windfarm at Carrickeeny in north-west Leitrim on behalf of Ikea, which 
will sell the power from the farm to energy company Vayu. In turn, Vayu will supply electricity to Ikea under a 15-
year contract. The energy company will ensure that Ikea's power requirement in Ireland is always sourced from 
wind energy. The Irish Independent XXXX Diageo is rolling out a new version of its Baileys cream liqueur concocted 
by the son of the drink's original inventor. The company behind Guinness unveiled the drink in London yesterday as 
it revealed that it paid its former boss more than £14.7m (E17m) in the company's most recent financial year. 
According to its annual report, Diageo paid Paul Walsh a basic salary of £1.3m (E1.5m) in the year to the end of 
June. While that was unchanged on the previous year, he also received a bonus of £1.2m and another £12.2m in 
long-term bonuses based on the company's share price. Diageo has a hand in nearly every drinks sector on the 
planet. Apart from Guinness and Baileys, it also counts Smithwicks, Bushmills whiskey, Johnnie Walker whisky and 
Smirnoff Vodka among its many brands. The Irish Independent

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has named the five airlines he expects to be the only major players left in 
the European market of the future.
Air France, British Airways, EasyJet and Lufthansa join O'Leary's Irish budget carrier on his shortlist.
He reckons Ryanair still has a long way to go toward reaching its full potential in Europe, and is casting his eye 
further afield: long-haul low-cost services to the USA are a possibility, he says, but only if Europe and America sign 
a full open-skies deal.
As it strives to maximise European business, Ryanair is exploring the potential of adding new bases to the 57 it 
already operates across the continent, with a focus on airports larger than the "secondary or tertiary" ones it already 
serves.
O'Leary confirms that German airports Cologne and Dortmund have approached his airline with incentives to 
operate there as services by Air Berlin are cut back.
Network contraction by rivals is also creating opportunities in Spain and Italy, says O'Leary, while even busy 
airports such as London Gatwick - to which Ryanair operates, but at which it does not have a base - have slots at 
certain times of the day amenable to non-time-sensitive flights serving holiday destinations.
As for adding transatlantic services, O'Leary sketches out a vision of operating 30-40 long-range twinjets of the size 
of the Airbus A330 or Boeing 787, but notes an obstacle: lack of aircraft availability due to the order backlog created 
by Gulf airlines' expansion.

Ryanair fell to the foot of a flat FTSE Eurofirst after pilots at the Dublin-listed budget airline called for an inquiry into 
employment practices and their impact on safety.
Shares in the Irish carrier fell 3.8 per cent to EUR6.93 after the Ryanair Pilot Group, an unofficial body seeking 
union representation, conducted a private survey of pilots and first officers and found that nine-tenths of those 
polled had issues over the company's employment conditions and wanted regulators to investigate.
Rival airlines were mostly lower with German flag carrier Lufthansa down 1 per cent to EUR14.69 and Air France-
KLM down 1.2 per cent to EUR6.53.
But Air Berlin , the German no-frills operator, gained 6.9 per cent to EUR2.14.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the session marginally higher at 1,230.03.
Deutsche Bank raised its rating on ING from hold to buy, favouring the Dutch financial services group because it 
was becoming "closer to being just a bank" given divestments in its insurance business under its recent 
restructuring. This means it would be in a better position to repay state aid sooner.

Analyst David Lock also raised ING's target price to EUR10 from EUR7.70. He said: "Removing state aid brings 
forward the potential for restarting dividends earlier."
Shares in ING gained 1.5 per cent to EUR8.71.
Solvay , the Belgian speciality chemicals company, was - in turn - upgraded by ING analysts.
Its stock was raised from hold to buy and its target price was lifted from EUR110 to EUR120. Shares in Solvay rose 
2.5 per cent to EUR108.15.
BASF and Lanxess , Solvay's German rivals, climbed 2 per cent to EUR66.11 and 2.7 per cent to EUR46.76, 
respectively.
German mid-cap industrial services group Bilfinger , which manages plants for BASF, rose 3.1 per cent to 
EUR74.30 after its fall in second-quarter operating profit was not as bad as feared.
Telekom Austria was one of only a small handful of other companies reporting and its shares lost 1.7 per cent to 
EUR5.63 after a 10 per cent fall in core earnings.

After meeting Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary at the budget carrier's Dublin headquarters, operations and safety 
editor David Learmount (centre) took a 737 jumpseat ride to Ryanair's Portuguese base at Faro with chief pilot Ray 
Conway, (left), while Faro base captain Klaus Wegner (right) shared flying duties. "With four of us in the cockpit we 
were a bit shoehorned in," says David, "but it was good to see how they handled the flight." Whatever one may 
think of its take on luggage, he adds, nobody should doubt Ryanair's commitment to safety.

Pilots at Europe's biggest low-cost airline Ryanair feel inhibited from reporting safety concerns and want regulators 
to establish the impact on safety of its employment practices, a group of pilots seeking union representation said 
today.
The Irish carrier has become famous for its low-fare no-frills service which has led to controversial additional 
charges for everything from paying by most normal cards, checking in at the airport, carrying hold bags and 
reserving seats.
But the unofficial Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) said it had polled more than 1,000 pilots and first officers, over a third 
of the airline's total, and found 94 percent wanted regulators to conduct an inquiry into the impact of employment 
practices on safety.
It also said 89 percent did not consider that the airline had an open and transparent safety culture and two thirds 
were not comfortable raising issues through an internal reporting system. Ryanair declined immediate comment, but 
said in its annual report at the end of last month that it has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality in its 29 
years of operation and that it encourages flight crews to report any safety concerns through its Safety Alert Initial 
Report system or to use an online confidential system. "Ryanair has no comment at this time," a spokeswoman 
said. RPG's chairman, Evert van Zwol, who is not a Ryanair pilot but until recently was president of the Dutch 
Airline Pilots Association (VNV), said some three quarters of Ryanair pilots are employed through agencies and 
nearly all of these are on so-called zero-hour contracts, which offer no guaranteed work. The Irish Airline Pilots' 
Association trade union said these contracts had some of the worst conditions in the industry. That could mean 
pilots may shy away from speaking up, for example on whether their plane was carrying enough fuel, or choose to 
fly when sick, van Zwol said. While there was no proof that this was the case, the concerns warranted a full

independent inquiry to establish if there were any grounds for safety concerns, he said. The RPG said it gave the 
survey results to Ryanair and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). "This needs to be followed up by someone 
independent," Van Zwol said. "It's mind-boggling that these people are not taking a pro-active stance - what could 
possibly be wrong with a pro-active investigation?" The IAA declined to comment. Last year the IAA launched an 
investigation following emergency landings by three Ryanair planes in Spain after they approached their minimum 
required fuel. The report found the planes were carrying more than the minimum, but recommended the company 
review its fuel policies for planes flying into some busy airports during poor weather conditions. Britain's Channel 4 
television is due to broadcast a documentary later on Monday about Ryanair, in which it says it speaks to pilots on 
their concerns about passenger safety, including fuel policy and working conditions.

British Revenue targeting Ryanair pilots in Britain

Pilots employed by Ryanair are being investigated by the British revenue authorities over their tax records.
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has sent letters and questionnaires to British pilots employed by the Irish 
airline, questioning why they cannot find their tax returns or social insurance records.
Many Ryanair pilots are not direct employees of the company, but are hired as contractors through a complex 
structure. The pilots are assigned as directors in pre-formed companies, and then subcontract their services.
In documents seen by *The Sunday Business Post*, HMRC has stated that "most individuals who are resident in 
Britain are taxable on the arising basis, and pay tax on their worldwide income and gains . . . although you appear 
to be resident in Britain, we have no tax record for you".
The pilots are asked to declare any sources of income, and the reason this was not declared.
The British authority requested copies of the full accounts of the companies of which these British pilots were 
directors, asking how often have the company directors met, the format of meetings, and whether these are face-to-
face. The pilots have also been asked to forward "minutes of their meetings" to HMRC, and advised that the "best 
way to progress this compliance check would be to have a meeting [with them]."
A HMRC spokesman told The Sunday Business Post that it could not give out sector specific information but that 
"the government has been clear that avoidance of taxes is unacceptable".
"At the last budget the government brought forward a package of measures to prevent the avoidance of 
employment taxes, including measures to strengthen legislation to stop offshore employers of British workers from 
avoiding tax, and to stop limited liability partnerships from being used to avoid employment taxes," he said.
"Additionally, HMRC through their compliance function will pursue anyone who puts in artificial arrangements, in an 
attempt to avoid employment taxes."
British Revenue targeting Ryanair pilots in Britain
A Ryanair spokesman said that, "like many other airlines, Ryanair employs a mix of direct employees and 
contractors". He said all contractors were required by contract to be tax-compliant in the country where they are 
employed, "which in the vast majority of cases is Ireland".
The company spokesman said that the majority of captains were direct employees, while the majority of first officers 
were contractors.
"The overwhelming majority [of pilots] pay their tax and social taxes in Ireland, to the benefit of the Irish exchequer 
because they are employed on Irish contracts and work on Irish territory (Irish-registered aircraft)," he added.
Meanwhile, a Dispatches programme, Ryanair: Secrets from the Cockpit, will air on Channel 4 tomorrow night, 
where pilots speak about their worries over Ryanair's fuel policy and their working conditions.

Aer Lingus must truly take off
Of the several options outlined in your August 4 article concerning Aer Lingus, there seems, to this writer at least, 
only one genuinely valid and worthwhile choice. The worst of all, by the way, is to see Aer Lingus, after decades of 
subvention, coerced out of the Irish taxpayer, sinking into oblivion by being absorbed into British Airways, a 
floundering entity -- shabby, sclerotic and elephantine in equal measure.
The right choice is to stand alone, indeed even more than that -- it is to become the airline it should always have 
been.
We should disabuse ourselves of certain debilitating ideas, such as that Ireland is "only a small country" and that it 
is an "island behind an island" and such. Ireland, in air transport terms, stands in a strategically advantageous 
position not unlike that enjoyed by the UAE (the same size as Ireland, by the way), and Singapore (half the size of 
Co Louth), and this should be capitalised upon.
It has been shown in one case that a small Irish company can, by judicious management, become an immensely 
profitable world-beater in this area (yes, Ryanair) and, if we could disabuse ourselves of the groundless, media-
generated idea that there is necessarily a vendetta between that undertaking and Aer Lingus (that they operate in 
different, indeed complementary sectors of the business), it would be clear that no real obstacle exists to prevent 
Aer Lingus becoming the global leader it should be either.

**Strength through unity**
Letters to the Editor
I read in a letter from Dick Keane in your paper last Sunday that Irish unity must be "taken off the table until 
unionists demand it". One wonders if the nationalist call for an end to gerrymandering at elections or job 
discrimination by unionist-controlled councils would also have had to wait until the same unionists "demanded" it, 
since these things too were in their day an essential bulwark to unionists' sense of 'security' and entitlement.
To give an international example, would it have been appropriate to have taken demands to end apartheid "off the 
table" until the Afrikaners demanded it? Would that have been a just and proper thing to do?
It's interesting that Dick Keane thinks that unionists have a right to "fight". Does he then approve of Carson's 
original threat of civil war -- backed, it must be remembered, by the British army officers in the Curragh in 1914 -- to 
defy a democratic government decision approving Home Rule? Does he believe that the threats since then to resort 
to violence by unionists when power-sharing, or a ban on a sectarian parade by the British government was their 
"right"? In that case, his views would be parallel to those of the late Billy Wright.
The call for Irish unity and sovereignty is not about colonising anyone. It's about empowering all the people of 
Ireland to direct and manage their own affairs.

**Kenny's move to Newstalk**
It was not strange to see so many column inches given towards Pat Kenny and his retirement to Newstalk. Media 
pundits were all over the news being questioned about what it would mean for RTE Radio 1. Many have got it right -
- it will dent RTE Radio 1 and give a boost to the ailing Newstalk.
However, they all failed to mention those who have lost their jobs or taken pay cuts across every section of the 
media in the past four years.
Little time was given to the crisis that exists in the media, something that Pat Kenny's move will not rectify. It is 
unlikely that his massive wage package will be divided among ten new journalists or that the savings in wages will 
go towards better programming across RTE. No, RTE will use such savings to plug the large gap in its faltering 
revenues. The public can only hope that more high earners move to greener pastures.
It is surprising that RTE didn't stipulate a six-month cooling off period for Pat Kenny. Most high-profiled and 
expensive contracts have such conditions built into them, but it seems that RTE management were happy to allow 
Pat to start almost immediately with their competitor.
You would think that such a valuable investment would be laid to rest for a good long period.

**What cost breast screening?**
Your articles regarding recent findings that breast screening may do more harm than good, due to over-diagnosis 
and unnecessary treatment (*4/8/13*), raise some important questions. Dr Susan O'Reilly of the National Cancer 
Control Programme and Dr Ann O'Doherty of BreastCheck have disagreed with the conclusions, both believing that 
on the level of an individual patient, there is no way of knowing who would or would not benefit from screening, and 
that the current policy of mass screening should continue.
However, for a policymaker or key decision maker, as both these women are, decisions need to be made at a 
societal level, not that of an individual, which is ultimately unknowable. Will screening benefit society as a whole or 
Letters to the Editor
not? Resources in health care are scarce and hard choices have to be made so that these resources are allocated 
efficiently and equitably.
Every screening costs time and money and prevents spending in other areas. For example, how many home visits 
by a public health nurse to the elderly to dress leg ulcers is worth one screening? How many hours of an 
ambulance on call would you trade? We may wish to do both, but the reality is we can't. If 30 years of study have 
found no overall benefit to breast screening then it's time to have a good think about how better to spend our 
money.

**Call for travel levy a shame**
Fearghal O'Connor's article (*4/8/13*) about unions calling for a levy on pensioners' free travel passes to protect rail 
workers from pay cuts appalled me. Siptu's Irish Rail organiser, Paul Cullen, obviously has not taken into account 
that many public service pensioners have had their pensions reduced to 2007 levels.
In his eagerness to prevent pay cuts for his members, he has also failed to accredit the triple pay for Sundays and 
bank holidays, payment which far exceeds the present social welfare pension.
Perhaps Mr Cullen would consider asking his members to forgo the benefits associated with their employment, 
such as free travel and medical care?

Ruling queries Ryanair's pilot employment model
One of Ryanair's pilots has won a test case in a London court that will have repercussions for other cockpit crew in 
dispute with the carrier, and possibly for the viability of the complex pilot employment model it uses.
The case was brought at the Mayor's and City of London Court by Brookfield Aviation International, the UK-based 
agency that recruits pilots for Ryanair and carries out much of the contractual and human resources work on behalf 
of the airline.
Brookfield alleged that the pilot owed it E5,000 ($6,600) for failing to work his full notice after he resigned. It claimed 
that he had no right to use 10 days' remaining leave as part of the notice period.
But the judge ruled that the sum demanded bore no relationship to the cost of loss of business and was therefore a 
deterrent penalty, which is invalid under UK employment law.
London commercial law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which briefed the pilot's case, explains that Brookfield 
requires would-be pilots to engage an accountancy firm, from an approved shortlist, to arrange for the pilot to 
become a director of a limited company based in Ireland.
This service company subsequently enters into a contract to provide the pilot's services to Brookfield, which, in turn, 
provides them to Ryanair.
"The consequence of this arrangement is that Ryanair denies the pilot's employment and other direct rights against 
it, even though it is the party to whom their services are ultimately and exclusively provided," says the law firm.
"Despite this arrangement, the pilots do not enjoy the advantages of autonomy and control of their working 
arrangements that self-employment usually entails."
Ruling queries Ryanair 's pilot employment model
The judgement in the case makes reference to the "bizarre nature" of the agreement.
Brookfield has not filed for an appeal, says Bates Wells Braithwaite. Three similar cases have been awaiting the 
outcome of this one.
"This is an important decision because it fundamentally challenges the relationship that Ryanair has with many of 
its pilots," claims William Garnett, the head of the firm's employment team. "The court has found that it is not lawful 
to penalise these pilots in the way that Ryanair's agency has tried to do."
Ryanair Pilot Group, which says that budget airline Norwegian has adopted a similar contracting model, notes: "The 
ruling serves to highlight flaws in the employment model that Ryanair imposes on the majority of its pilots."

Section: COMMENT
Length: 252 words
Body
Pronouncing a verdict in favour of a Ryanair pilot against his employer, a London judge described the airline's pilot 
employment contract arrangements as "bizarre", but notably did not say they were illegal. The issue was the way 
Ryanair's crew agency Brookfield Aviation International interpreted specific contract details.
This verdict, on its own, will not make any difference to the big picture, although it will encourage Ryanair pilots to 
challenge other Brookfield interpretations of their contracts. Ryanair's leader, Michael O'Leary, has an adversarial 
style with his pilots, cabin crew and even passengers. He squares up to them like a prizefighter, challenging them to 
get the better of him and his system. They very rarely do. Ryanair's recent results show its impressive profits come 
mainly from the "extras" passengers find themselves compelled to buy, which feel like a series of teasing left-hooks 
from O'Leary. But his pilots get paid, and he gets the passengers to their destinations cheaply and on time, so they 
resign themselves to the system.
The long-term question is whether the "bizarre" pilot employment model is sustainable. O'Leary admits the purpose 
of it is, above all, to prevent the pilots being able to form a negotiating unit. Meanwhile, the Ryanair Pilots Group - 
which O'Leary does not recognise - is a more canny manifestation of its predecessor. If it delivers enough left-
hooks of its own it may wear him down, but this court case result is no knockout blow.

Could Aer Lingus fly solo?

Arenewed bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus cannot be ruled out as the airline continues to battle against the UK 
Competition Commission's (UKCC) attempt to make it sell its minority stake in Aer Lingus, according to analysts. 
But strong financial results in recent days suggest that, despite continuing consolidation in the European aviation 
sector, Aer Lingus could have a viable future as an independent airline.
Given that it has EUR 1 billion on its books, Aer Lingus could even be in a position to acquire other similar 
European niche carriers in a bid to shore up its independent future, said one analyst. So what are the options now 
for the airline?
**Ryan Lingus**
Last February, most believed Ryanair's latest failed attempt to buy Aer Lingus was probably its last. Recent 
evidence may suggest otherwise. Last month's announcement that it would sell its 29 per cent Aer Lingus stake 
appeared to signal a final disengagement. But the details were all-important and, in reality, it was probably a bid to 
thwart UKCC's likely ruling that could force Ryanair to sell its stake on competition grounds. Ryanair will only sell its 
stake to a carrier that can first win acceptance from 50.1 per cent of Aer Lingus's other shareholders.
Hardly an easy task, and Ryanair knows it. "That announcement was purely aimed at weakening the commission's 
arguments," said one aviation sector analyst.
A further announcement that it was increasing frequencies on its Dublin-to-Britain routes also seems to be a move 
designed to negate the competition arguments. "Ryanair is going to a lot of trouble to hold on to its Aer Lingus 
stake, so it may well still have ambitions to be the ultimate owner," said the analyst. Any new bid would face huge -- 
perhaps insurmountable -- hurdles. But last week, Aer Lingus lost a High Court challenge to prevent Ryanair 
making another bid until next February.
**Look up! It's British Airways**
Could Aer Lingus fly solo?
British Airways, or its parent company IAG, is seen by many as the most likely longterm home for Aer Lingus. IAG 
boss Willie Walsh is a former Aer Lingus chief executive, Aer Lingus's route network would fit naturally with BA's, 
and its plentiful slots at London Heathrow would prove a huge asset as BA struggles for room to grow and British 
politicians prevaricate over expanding London's airports.
"Aer Lingus has the third-highest number of slots at Heathrow, which are worth anywhere between stg£5 million 
and £20 million apiece and would be hugely valuable for British Airways for future growth," said Goodbody analyst 
Donal O'Neill.
But despite the undoubted attractions of acquiring Aer Lingus, most analysts believe the timing is wrong. Walsh has 
his hands full sorting out IAG's Spanish airline Iberia, as well as the recent acquisition of discount carrier Vueling. 
Potential US deals are also rumoured.
The fact that BA was often described as a giant pension fund with a small airline attached might also curtail its 
appetite for taking on board Aer Lingus which, despite protracted attempts, has still not sorted out its own pension 
mess.
**Middle Eastern promise**
When Etihad bought a 3 per cent stake in Aer Lingus in 2012, it sparked a flurry of speculation about the Middle 
Eastern giant buying the airline. But when the dust settled, most agreed that the stake, its sponsorship of hurling 
and the commercial deals it has with Aer Lingus provide everything it desires from Ireland -- large numbers of 
transit passengers for its massive Abu Dhabi hub.
But last week, Etihad proved that it was interested in owning European airlines when it bought 49 per cent of 
Serbian flag carrier JAT. It will be rebranded as Air Serbia, managed by Etihad and pumped full of cash. Non-
European airlines are precluded from owning majority shares in EU airlines. But, in theory, there is nothing to stop 
Air Berlin, in which Etihad has a 29 per cent, being used as a way to gain a controlling stake. Also, EU ownership 
rules are up for negotiation at the next EU-US trade talks.
**European contenders**
It is likely that continuing consolidation means the European aviation landscape will look quite different in five years, 
with a lot more capacity in the hands of the five largest carriers -- Ryanair, Easyjet, Lufthansa, IAG and Air France. 
SAS and Finnair, both similar to Aer Lingus, are rumoured to be close to a merger, for example.
Lufthansa -- after IAG and Ryanair -- is the most likely European giant to eye up Aer Lingus but its recent sale of 
BMI suggests that Aer Lingus, similarly profiled, would not be of interest. Air France has too many problems of its 
own.
Easyjet, while it would certainly have the cash, would have no interest in buying into Ryanair's back yard.
Finally, Turkish Airlines, one of the fastest-growing and most progressive airlines in the world, would be curtailed by 
EU ownership rules, at least for now.
**Transatlantic suitors**
Aer Lingus's tradition -- and renewed vigour -- on transatlantic routes gives the airline a profile in the US that few 
other regional European players have. Its codeshare partnership with JetBlue, which includes sharing a terminal at 
JFK, is a fine example. Analysts do not rule out the possibility of JetBlue -- or another US carrier -- taking an 
interest or at least a minority stake in Aer Lingus. But why would an airline like JetBlue want a stake in Aer Lingus 
when it can achieve its key aims through codeshares and other commercial arrangements?
**Going it alone**
Could Aer Lingus fly solo?
Results from Aer Lingus for the first half of the year again impressed the markets, suggesting that looking 
elsewhere for the key to the airline's successful may be missing the point. If it can continue to generate profits, sort 
out its pension fund and rid itself of the shadow of a renewed Ryanair, many analysts believe it has a future as a 
relatively small niche airline, particularly if it can develop further partnerships along the lines of what it is doing with 
JetBlue and Etihad.
"If anything, Aer Lingus is in a position to be an acquirer of other airlines rather than to be acquired," said O'Neill.
"Its own operational situation is continuously improving with a lot of growth back on the table, very strong operating 
leverage in its business model, very strong cashflows and no particular need for capital expenditure in the next 
three to four years."

Just what is an audit meant to achieve? Much of the legal battle to come between the Quinn Insurance 
administrators and PricewaterhouseCoopers will focus on this.
Many members of the public may believe that an audit is a detailed examination to verify all the facts set out in a set 
of financial statements.
They may think that the audit looks at every transaction carried out by the organisation or that it judges the 
appropriateness of the organisation's business activities or strategies or decisions made by the directors.
But an independent audit is much more limited than that. The simplest way to consider what the audit does do is to 
start at its conclusion: the auditor's report.
The centrepiece of the auditor's report is an opinion of whether the financial statements "give a true and fair view" of 
the state of the firm's financial position at the financial year end and of its results for the period. So the auditors 
don't give a certificate or a guarantee: they give an opinion. They don't conclude that the financial statements are 
wholly accurate: they conclude as to whether they give "a true and fair view". And they don't report to the whole 
world: their report is addressed to the firm's shareholders.
This means, in the words of one celebrated legal judgement, that the auditor is "a watchdog, not a bloodhound". It 
means that the financial statements under review are materially accurate. Auditing standards (SAS 220) define 
materiality to mean that "a matter is material if its omission would reasonably influence the decisions of an 
addressee of the auditors' report. Likewise, a misstatement is material if it would have a similar influence".
This all means that audits will, typically, start with auditors assessing the areas of greatest risk for material 
assessment of financial statements and planning their audits to concentrate work on those areas.
That work will include sampling transactions to ensure that systems can be relied upon to generate accurate 
information and a check of balance-sheet assets and liabilities.
Auditing issues are not always black and white
It is important to note that the preparation of a firm's financial statements is the responsibility of the firm's directors. 
It is they, after all, who sign those financial statements. And it is they who decide on the firm's key accounting 
policies.
That might sound like an arcane and inconsequential point. But firms have considerable latitude to adopt different 
accounting policies or assumptions.
Consider the aircraft depreciation policies of Ireland's two publicly-listed airlines. For short-haul aircraft, Aer Lingus 
assumes a useful economic life of 18 years, whereas Ryanair assumes 23 years.
And at the end of an aircraft's useful economic life, Aer Lingus assumes a residual value of 10 per cent, but Ryanair 
assumes 15 per cent. Apply these varying assumptions to EUR 1 million of new aircraft assets and you get varying 
annual depreciation charges: Aer Lingus would charge EUR 50,000, whereas Ryanair would charge nearly EUR 
37,000.
That's a big difference. Yet both firms' auditors (PwC at Aer Lingus and KPMG at Ryanair) are content to sign off on 
each company's accounts as being "true and fair". How can that be?
In the main, these aircraft are being held for their full lives by the airlines. And, over those full lives, any possible 
depreciation undercharge during the early years of an aircraft's life will eventually be compensated by an 
overcharge in later years. So things will even out, over the full life of the aircraft.
But perhaps the biggest argument is that any difference may not be material. Had Ryanair followed Aer Lingus's 
more conservative depreciation policy from its foundation, its shareholders' equity position in the balance sheet 
would be reduced by less than 15 per cent, compared to its current position.
PwC's problem is that QIL's key liabilities fall into this category and can be, therefore, difficult to value.
Thus, an insurance company might have written 1,000 motor insurance policies in 2000. Claims might have been 
made on 100 of those policies, of which 90 might have been settled by the end of 2002. But it is quite likely that the 
most expensive cases will have taken the longest to settle.
The very complexity of insurance company operations has given rise to the actuarial profession. It is notable that, 
despite being one of the largest insurance companies in the country, QIL had no in-house actuary. No doubt PwC 
saw this as an added risk factor when it came to prepare for the QIL audit.

Body
The IDA is backing plans to develop a shipping-finance centre in Dublin, in a bid to emulate the city's position as an 
international aviation leasing hub.
In a filing to Dublin City Council, the firm ISSC said it was acting for an unidentified investor planning a shipping 
services project that might result in more than 3,500 jobs in the capital's docklands. In a separate filing, IDA said it 
supported the proposals.
The shipping services centre "in Dublin docklands will become the prime location for shipping finance, leasing, 
innovative debt structuring products and specialist maritime services including securitising and listing," ISSC said.
Ireland is already established as an international aviation hub, a position aided by the country's 12.5 per cent 
corporation tax rate. Half the world's commercial leased aircraft are managed from Ireland, according to the IDA.

the airport's passenger charges from the start of 2015. Yesterday, it published a consultation paper outlining the 
costs likely to be taken into account when calculating this, including the authority's investment in the terminal. The

The IDA is backing plans to develop a shipping-finance centre in Dublin, in a bid to emulate the city's position as an 
international aviation leasing hub.
In a filing to Dublin City Council, the firm ISSC said it was acting for an unidentified investor planning a shipping 
services project that might result in more than 3,500 jobs in the capital's docklands. In a separate filing, IDA said it 
supported the proposals.
The shipping services centre "in Dublin docklands will become the prime location for shipping finance, leasing, 
innovative debt structuring products and specialist maritime services including securitising and listing," ISSC said.
Ireland is already established as an international aviation hub, a position aided by the country's 12.5 per cent 
corporation tax rate. Half the world's commercial leased aircraft are managed from Ireland, according to the IDA. 
The Irish Times XXXX Dublin Airport Authority is set to clash with the aviation regulator over a claim the cost of 
building a second terminal was 20 per cent higher than originally allowed at E923 million, as a debate over future 
airport charges gets under way. The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is preparing to revise the cap on 
the airport's passenger charges from the start of 2015. Yesterday, it published a consultation paper outlining the 
costs likely to be taken into account when calculating this, including the authority's investment in the terminal. The 
Irish Times XXXX The four adult children of solicitor Brian O'Donnell have lost their court action aimed at preventing

The ISEQ is up 61 points this afternoon as European and US markets soar on the back of better than expected US 
employment data and revised GDP figures. Earlier Chinese data was confusing but has had little overall impact 
according to market participants and the primary focus today was on the Central Banks and US figures for 
indications of a growing recovery in the US.
All of the above have been delivered on and the markets have responded positively with CRH up 1.6pc and Glanbia 
up 1pc. Irish Continental is up 1.7pc while Ryanair rose by 3.22pc to 7.17.
The logic for such a surge in European stocks seems to be based on the US lifting all boats theory and given the 
interdependence of the US and European economies this does not seem unreasonable. Recent data from Europe 
seems to offer some reasonable hope for the economies of the region with positive data emerging from Portugal, 
Ireland and of course Germany. There is significance in the emergence from the depths of recession of Portugal 
and Spain as well as Ireland which can have a significant impact on growth prospects for the region overall.
Currencies have been all over the place in recent days however there seems to have been a muted response today 
to the US data according to one currency trader in London who expected the US Dollar to gradually regain ground 
lost on the Euro in recent weeks. Report by Cathal O Dubhain

Ryanair 's Michael O'Leary Wants To Raise Baggage Fees So High Passengers Will Check In Without

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary Wants To Raise Baggage Fees So High 
Passengers Will Check In Without Luggage

Aug 01, 2013 (International Business Times News:http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Michael O'Leary, the colorful, outrageous, obnoxious and wildly entertaining chief executive of budget Irish airliner 
Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) is at it again. Now he says that he wants to reduce the number of airline passengers 
who check luggage by half and may even begin charging people for cabin baggage (i.e., hand luggage, or carry-
ons).
 According to a report in the Independent newspaper, checking bags on a Ryanair flight this summer could cost 
anywhere from £25 to £160 ($38 to $244) for a one-way flight. These fees could be further increased. Currently, 20 
percent of Ryanair passengers check their bags -- but even that figure is too high, by O'Leary's reckoning, citing 
that cutting the weight of luggage on flights would save fuel costs, reduce costs of handling and quicken turnaround 
times.
 Already, the proportion of Ryanair fliers who check luggage has plunged from 80 percent to 20 percent. O'Leary's 
goal is to raise charges on baggage to such high levels that travelers will be dissuades from carrying aboard 
anything bigger than a wallet. 'We will keep increasing until we get rid of the bags,' he told a conference in London. 
'Carrying a bag costs me money.' He then quipped: 'The husbands of the world have united to fund a statue to me 
because I have relieved them of having to persuade their wives to take fewer luggages when they are going on 
holiday. Even Mrs. O'Leary now travels with the one 10 [kilogram] carryon bag. We no longer wait at check-in desks 
and no longer have to hang around at baggage carousels. It's brilliant.'
 With respect to charging for cabin baggage, the Hungary-based Eastern European low-cost carrier Wizz Air and 
Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE) already charge for anything larger than the size of a laptop bag.
 O'Leary, a fanatic for cutting costs, has already enacted a number of measures to reduce such expenses, often to 
the annoyance of travelers. Among other things, he has eliminated check-in counters, forced passengers to print 
their own boarding passes and even ordered pilots to fly slower in order to save fuel. "We're very keen to find ways 
to ensure our pilots are flying in the most fuel-efficient and safe fashion," said O'Leary. "All we're doing is trying to 
fly two minutes slower per flight. The best advice is to slow down, keep the windows closed and turn off the air 
conditioning.' Unlike virtually every other company on the planet, O'Leary also eschews the idea of using social 
media websites like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) or Twitter.
 O'Leary has a long history of bizarre behavior and statements. Herewith follows a list of some of O'Leary's choicest 
quotes compiled over the years:
 *On his value as an executive:
Ryanair 's Michael O'Leary Wants To Raise Baggage Fees So High Passengers Will Check In Without 
Luggage
 '[I am Europe's] most underpaid and underappreciated boss. I'm paid about 20 times more than the average 
employee [at Ryanair], and I think the gap should be wider. I was paid €1.2-million last year for carrying 80 million 
passengers. [Irish rival] Aer Lingus' boss [Christoph Mueller] got €1.3-million for carrying [only] 9 million 
passengers.'
 *On why he takes holidays, though he considers them a 'waste of time.'
 'I do it because I have a wife and four children who insist that I have to go away every year otherwise they will be 
traumatized. Of course, I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage.'
 *On Suzy McLeod, the British woman who gained a tremendous amount of media attention and public sympathy 
after Ryanair charged more than €200 to print five boarding passes from a flight from Spain to UK (since she failed 
to print them out beforehand).
 'As you know, there are no internet cafés in Alicante [Spain], there are no hotels in Alicante that would provide 
print-outs and no fax machines so that some friend or colleague at home could print them out and fax them down to 
you… To those who don't [print passes beforehand], we say quite politely: 'Bugger off'
 *And yet more on Mrs. McLeod:
 'Mother pays £200 for being an idiot and failing to comply with her agreement at the time of booking. We think Mrs. 
McLeod should pay €60 [just] for being so stupid... Thank you, Mrs. McLeod, but it was your f_ck-up. We're not 
changing our policy.'
 *On obese airline passengers:
 "Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat bastard on board. We have been frankly astonished at the number of 
customers who don't only want to tax fat people but torture them."
 *On the merger between national carriers British Airways and Iberia:
 '"It reminds me of two drunks leaning on each other."
 *On how his underlings celebrate Ryanair's success:
 'I'm here with Howard Miller and Michael Cawley, our two deputy chief executives. But they're presently making 
love in the gentleman's toilets, such is their excitement at today's results.'
 *His view on refunds:
 "You're not getting a refund, so f_ck off. We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you 
understand?"
 *On the rights of customers:
 "People say the customer is always right, but you know what - they're not. Sometimes they are wrong and they 
need to be told so."
 *On German airline customers:
 "[Jurgen] Weber [Lufthansa's chief executive] says Germans don't like low fares. How the f_ck does he know? He's 
never offered them any. The Germans will crawl bollock-naked over broken glass to get them.'
 *On British liberals who pretend to be environmentalists:
 'The chattering bloody classes, or what I call the liberal Guardian [newspaper] readers, they're all buying SUVs to 
drive around London. I smile at these loons who drive their SUVs down to Sainsbury's [supermarket] and buy kiwi 
fruit from New Zealand. They're flown in from New Zealand for Christ sakes. They're the equivalent of 
environmental nuclear bombs!'
 On environmentalists in general:
 'We want to annoy the f_ckers whenever we can. The best thing you can do with environmentalists is shoot them. 
These head-bangers want to make air travel the preserve of the rich. They are Luddites marching us back to the 
18th century. If preserving the environment means stopping poor people flying so the rich can fly, then screw it.'
 *On the possibility of charging airline passengers who want to use the toilet:
 "One thing we have looked at is maybe putting a coin slot on the toilet door so that people might actually have to 
spend a pound to spend a penny in the future. If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them 
myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver."
 *On the onslaught of commercialism that Ryanair passengers are subjected to during the flight:
 "Anyone who thinks Ryanair flights are some sort of bastion of sanctity where you can contemplate your navel is 
wrong. We already bombard you with as many in-flight announcements and trolleys as we can. Anyone who looks 
like sleeping, we wake them up to sell them things."
 *On the social status of Ryanair's clientele:
Ryanair 's Michael O'Leary Wants To Raise Baggage Fees So High Passengers Will Check In Without 
Luggage
 "Do we carry rich people on our flights? Yes, I flew on one this morning and I'm very rich."
 *On his image and the nature of the airline industry:
 "I don't give a f_ck if no one likes me. I am not a cloud bunny, I am not an aerosexual. I don't like airplanes. I never 
wanted to be a pilot like those other platoons of goons who populate the airline industry… There's a lot of big egos 
in this industry. Most chief executives got into this business because they want to travel for a living. Not me, I want 
to work.'
 *On his political views:
 "I think the most influential person in Europe in the last 20 to 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher, who has left a 
lasting legacy that has driven us towards lower taxes and greater efficiency. Without her we'd all be living in some 
French bloody unemployed republic."
 *On the value of employees:
 "MBA students come out with: "My staff is my most important asset." Bullsh_t! Staff is usually your biggest cost. 
We all employ some lazy [bastard] who needs a kick up the backside, but no one can bring themselves to admit it."
 *On the 'beneficial' effects on recession:
 'We need a recession. We have had 10 years of growth. A recession gets rid of crappy loss-making airlines and it 
means we can buy aircraft more cheaply.'
 *More on his love of recession:
 'We would welcome a good, deep, bloody recession for 12 to 18 months. We need one if we are going to see off 
some of this environmental nonsense that has become so popular among the chattering classes.'
 *On what Ryanair's trans-Atlantic flights would be like:
 'In economy, no frills; in business class it'll all be free - including the bl_wjobs.'
 *On his views on regulators:
 'We fight constantly with governments and idiot Brussels bureaucrats who want to put up the cost of air travel, or 
half-witted environmentalists who can't add two and two.'
 *On consultants:
 'I believe hiring consultants is an abdication by management of their responsibilities. If the consultant is so good at 
managing change, then why not hire him to run the company and do it himself? Every idiot who gets fired in the 
industry shows up as a consultant somewhere. I would shoot any consultant who came through my door.'
 *On Bertie Ahern, the former prime minister of Ireland:
 'We have a Government of lemmings, led by the biggest lemming of all, who is incapable of making a long-term 
decision.'
 *More on Ahern:
 'I'm disrespectful towards authority. Like I think the prime minister of Ireland is a gobsh_te [do-nothing babbler].'
 *His views on fellow airline executives:
 *The problem with the airline business is it is mostly run by a bunch of spineless nincompoops who actually don't 
want to stand up to the environmentalists and call them the lying wankers that they are.'
 *On how he has opened the skies to the poor.
 'For years flying has been the preserve of rich f_ckers. Now everyone can afford to fly.'
 *On the usefulness of travel agents.
 'Screw the travel agents. Take the f_ckers out and shoot them. What have they done for passengers over the 
years?"
 *On the nature of competition.
 *There is too much: "we really admire our competitors". All bollocks. Everyone wants to kick the sh_t out of 
everyone else. We want to beat the crap out of [British Airways]. They mean to kick the crap out of us.'
 *On the rise of the Irish in Europe's economy.
 'They don't call us the fighting Irish for nothing. We have been the travel innovators of Europe! We built the roads 
and laid the rails. Now it's the airlines!.. I'm Irish and we don't have to prove anything. We are God's own children.'
 *On what he envisions as the future of the airline industry:
 'Free tickets. In a decade or so, airlines will pay travelers to distribute people around Europe. The airline industry is 
Tesco, is Ikea, is network TV in the way viewers watch for free and advertisers pay for access to them, is the 
internet in the same way that websites earn money for delivering click-through traffic to other sites.'
 *On the 'majesty' of flying.
Ryanair 's Michael O'Leary Wants To Raise Baggage Fees So High Passengers Will Check In Without 
Luggage
 'Air transport is just a glorified bus operation.'
 *On his drive to succeed.
 'I would have murdered, I would have gone through concrete walls to make money… The meek may inherit the 
earth, but they will not have it for long.'
 *On possibly offering porn movies during flights.
 *I'm not talking about having it on screens on the back of seats for everyone to see. It would be on handheld 
devices. Hotels around the world have it, so why wouldn't we?'
 *On upgrading sales of alcohol on a flight:
 'If drink sales are falling off we get the pilots to engineer a bit of turbulence. That usually spikes up the drink sales.'
 *On the battle between Boeing and Airbus:
 'The message to Boeing today is: 'You keep building them, we'll keep buying them', and together both of us will 
kick the crap out of Airbus in Europe. We love Boeing. F_ck the French.'
 *On what his pilots earn:
 'People ask how we can have such low fares. I tell them our pilots work for nothing.'
 *On why his bride arrived 35 minutes late for their wedding: 'She's coming here with Aer Lingus.'
 *On how he has maintained his wealth.
 'I buy everything low-cost. I buy cheap shirts. I buy cheap shoes. It's a philosophy. I'm just cheap.'
 On Italy's Alitalia airline.
 'I would not want it if it were given to me as a present.'
 *On the value of air marshals:
 'Air marshals are a complete waste of time. I can't think of anything that would reduce security more than having a 
guy on board with a gun.'
 *On global warming and climate change:
 'Nobody can argue that there isn't climate change. The climate's been changing since time immemorial… Do I 
believe there is global warming? No, I believe it's all a load of bullsh_t. But it's amazing the way the whole f_cking 
eco-warriors and the media have changed. It used to be global warming, but now, when global temperatures 
haven't risen in the past 12 years, they say 'climate change'.'
 *And more on global warming:
 'Well, hang on, we've had an ice age. We've also had a couple of very hot spells during the Middle Ages, so 
nobody can deny climate change. But there's absolutely no link between man-made carbon, which contributes less 
than 2% of total carbon emissions [and climate change]… Scientists argue there is global warming because they 
wouldn't get half of the funding they get now if it turns out to be completely bogus.'

Saad Hammad
Flybe chief executive
His mission to lift the ailing carrier out of loss is a far from easy one, writes Jane Wild
Body
When Saad Hammad steps into the top role at Flybe today he faces a challenge: lifting the struggling airline out of 
loss and getting it fit to compete.
It will not be the first time that Mr Hammad has trodden the turnround path.
While he was chief commercial officer at easyJet from 2005 to 2009, the airline went from a period of profit 
warnings to growth. As managing director of private equity group Gores, which he has just left, he steered business 
transformations at Siemens corporate telephony and at Mexx.
He comes to the regional carrier with the aim of getting it to break even next year, after a year in which losses piled 
up sevenfold to £40.7m .
The process will be comparable to that at easyJet, Mr Hammad says, although the intention is not to "easyJetify" 
Flybe.
The turnround ace flown in to fix Flybe
"I had a similar encounter at easyJet when I walked in," he says. "They'd had two profit warnings, there was a lot of 
dysfunction. They didn't have a structured process in terms of route selection and, critically, route management."
It is early days, but Mr Hammad has formulated some hypotheses. A shake-up in strategy will sharpen Flybe's 
offering with a better mix of destinations and more appropriate schedule, for lower fares. The hope is that it will get 
its aircraft fuller - Flybe has a load factor of 62.6 per cent while easyJet and Ryanair are into the 80s.
In its quest to stabilise its core UK market, less popular routes will be dropped. But Mr Hammad believes that 
Flybe's strength lies in the thinner routes where the low-cost carriers, with their larger aircraft, would find less profit.
"There are certain routes they cannot fly and we need to maximise those before we go head-on against them. On a 
direct airport level there is hardly any overlap with Ryanair and only a handful of routes where there is overlap with 
easyJet."
On the southeast's flight capacity constraints, Mr Hammad is clear that there should be extra, price-controlled 
capacity, at Gatwick, or Heathrow, which he veers towards, as "the more logical place to do it in terms of the wider 
benefits".
Flybe will "rebalance", tilting away from the three-quarters of its capacity it deploys domestically, to develop routes 
to Europe from its bases of Southampton, Birmingham, Manchester and Belfast.
Southampton, only an hour from London by train, holds special potential, Mr Hammad says, with an opportunity to 
lure passengers from other airports.
"It's getting into the head of customers, understanding not just what they want but what they don't want - hassle, 
congestion, delays."
But with attention fixing on the UK, contract flying now moves down the list of priorities. Flybe Finland, run with 
Finnair, made revenues of £167.2m in its financial year to March 31, and previous chief executive Jim French had 
identified it as a growth area.
"Jim and the team succeeded in securing something with Finnair so full credit there," he says. But while optimising 
that business is desirable, "you can't do contract flying with other European national airlines if your core UK 
business is not solid; they're going to be very nervous dealing with you."
Being able to make decisions like the one on contract flying was essential to Mr Hammad accepting the role, given 
Mr French's deep involvement with Flybe's history.
"I really needed to make sure that there would be a total division of labour and clarity of roles between me and Jim; 
that I effectively would have a free hand running the business and he would be a non-executive chairman. He 
assured me he would not be a back-seat driver - that would give me a free hand to effect the transformation that 
Flybe needs."
The airline is well down the path of that transformation now, with £30m in costs already cut, with a target of £50m 
by 2014-15.
It has sufficient cash to see it through 12 months, Mr Hammad says, and he is firm that he will take "self-help 
measures that can generate cash", such as non-core asset disposals, before he would contemplate any action such 
as a rights issue. Getting a higher proportion of leisure travellers, who book earlier, will aid earnings visibility.
"There's a lot of hard work ahead but we've got a great business."

Spotify burns through cash Spotify, the Swedish digital music service that has been valued at $3bn, doubled its 
revenues in 2012 but burnt through cash as it attempted to grab a bigger share of the fast-growing market. The 
company's results show that its sales surged from (EURO)190.4m in 2011 to (EURO)434.7m in 2012, as active 
users doubled to more than 20m. However, net losses widened to (EURO)58.7m, against (EURO)45.4m in 2011. 
The results highlight a worry in the music industry that, while demand for streaming is growing fast, some of the 
largest companies in the market are yet to make a profit.
The Croods boosts DreamWorks Animation beat expectations in the second quarter thanks to a better than 
expected box office performance from The Croods, its film about a prehistoric family. But profits for 2013 will be 
constrained by the disappointing release of Turbo, its recent movie about a racing snail, which had a weaker than 
expected opening weekend performance in the US.
US banks hit by debit card fee ruling The Federal Reserve was criticised yesterday for being too soft on the 
financial industry after a judge ruled that limits on debit card fees charged to retailers were not tough enough.
Ryanair backs hand luggage fees The boss of Ryanair has declared all-out war on luggage by pledging to price 
passengers out of bringing bags on flights - and even hinting at fees for hand baggage. "It's unlikely in the short 
term but probably inevitable in the long term," Michael O'Leary said.
Greencore recovers from horsemeat Greencore, the UK's largest sandwich-maker said the market was still

Highlight: Ryanair says it is prepared to sell its 29% stake to another EU carrier.
Body
Low cost carrier Ryanair has offered to see its Aer Lingus stake to another EU airline.
Ryanair's decision to sell the 29% shareholding follows the UK Competition Commission's (CC) provisional decision 
that the stake could reduce competition on routes between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.
In May this year the UK CC said it was "particularly concerned about Ryanair's influence over Aer Lingus's ability to 
be acquired by, merge with, or acquire another airline".
Ryanair says in a statement: "In order to dispel the CC's unfounded and invented "concern" that Ryanair's 
shareholding may prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by another EU airline, Ryanair will undertake to 
unconditionally sell its 29% shareholding to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus and obtains 
acceptances from 50.1% of Aer Lingus shareholders."
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) referred the case to the UK CC in June 2012, shortly after which Ryanair made its 
third bid for Aer Lingus. The European Commission blocked the bid in February 2013.

AER LINGUS yesterday said its halfyear losses before tax widened 14.2 per cent to (EURO)28.2m (£24.7m), on 
revenues up five per cent at (EURO)657.9m.
Costs rose 6.9 per cent, which the firm said was partly due to one-off expenses linked to an increase in transatlantic 
services and the launch of Little Red, Virgin Atlantic's shorthaul service that uses planes and crew from Aer Lingus.
The firm expects operating profit for 2013 to be flat on last year.
Meanwhile Ryanair launched extra flights between the UK and Ireland in a bid to prove to the Competition 
Commission that its near-30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus does not lessen competition on the route.

Ryanair today announced that it would add additional daily frequencies from October on its five main Ireland-UK 
routes.
It said that the move is a direct response to similar flight increases recently announced by Aer Lingus for the 2013-
14 winter schedule.
The airline took the opportunity to have another swipe at the UK authorities' competition probe in to Ryanair's stake 
in Aer Lingus.
"Aer Lingus' decision to increase flight frequencies on these UK routes further undermines the discredited UKCC 
investigation into Ryanair's 6 1/2 year old minority (29pc) stake in Aer Lingus. Confronted with incontrovertible 
evidence that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified, the UKCC has been reduced to 
inventing fairytale future "concerns" that Ryanair has "influence" over Aer Lingus or that this stake has or will lead to 
a lessening of competition," Ryanair said. "The UKCC, in its provisional findings, has ignored, or excluded, 6 1/2 
years of evidence which totally disproves their bogus claims. It has failed to produce any evidence that competition 
would be lessened (or UK consumers penalised) when the European Commission recently (Feb 2013) prohibited 
Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus on the very grounds that competition has intensified between the two Irish airlines 
over the past 6 1/2 years. If, as the UKCC now claims, Ryanair has "influence" over Aer Lingus which "might"

deals for those few UK consumers who actually fly Aer Lingus." CEO Michael O'Leary said: "Ryanair will pursue

bags." "We will keep increasing charges until we get rid of hold bags,'' he said. He said Ryanair had reduced the 
number of its passengers who checked in hold baggage from 80pc to 19pc and that this was saving the airline "a 
fortune in money". But he accepted that some passengers would always want to bring big bags that needed to go in 
the hold. "We will never get rid of (hold) bags but I would be disappointed if we don't get our figure for (hold) bags 
down from around 20pc to 10pc,'' he said.

The ISEQ made only small gains this morning as Smurfit Kappa stocks lifted the index but as Ryanair shares 
weighed.
By 12:45, the index was up 7.77 points to 4,087.08.
Paper and packaging giant Smurfit Kappa recorded a 6pc increase in revenues for the six months to the end of 
June while operating profits - before exceptional items - inched 1pc higher. Half yearly revenues rose to E3.9 billion 
from E3.68 billion while operating profits, before exceptional items, rose by 1pc to E307m from E303m. The 
company said that it saw strong growth in the Americas both as a result of acquisitions and on an improved 
performance in Venezuela since the devaluation of the country's currency in the first quarter of 2013. But profits 
before income tax dropped by 31pc to E127m from E184m in what the company called a ''current challenging 
operation environment''. Shares climbed 49c to E15.00.
Ryanair's stocks fell 9c to E6.90. It intends to increase baggage charges until no-one takes its flights with luggage 
that needs to go in the hold, the airline's boss said today. Speaking at a news conference in London, Michael 
O'Leary said that Ryanair had increased its charge for hold luggage by E20 for the summer period. Asked what was 
the logic behind charging people more for the summer period, he replied: "That's when they are likely to bring more

LAST week, in an interview with Total Politics magazine, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said that he 
has told Wonga CEO Errol Damelin he wants to compete the payday loans company out of existence by 
strengthening credit unions.
Mentions of Wonga were seen by 45 per cent of UK Twitter users on Thursday and Friday of last week, compared 
to five per cent on the two days prior to that. It is clearly a story that has had a significant impact, but is Wonga 
susceptible to a challenge from the church? YouGov's BrandIndex Index score is a composite of six key image 
attributes. Wonga has been in the minus 30s all year and dropped to minus 42 this week following the Welby 
interview.
These scores make it the worst performing brand in terms of consumer sentiment of all 900 or so names that we 
track. Only Ryanair, with an average score of minus 36 compared to Wonga's minus 38, comes close to challenging 
for the title of Britain's least favourite brand.
Looking specifically at Wonga customers, we interviewed 89 over the past few weeks and saw that 24 per cent are 
satisfied, 41 per cent dissatisfied and 35 per cent neutral. This would equate to a satisfaction score among 
customers of -16, so not as bad as the view of the general public, but still very poor.
Over the same period Ryanair scores minus 22 for satisfaction among its customers (4,770 interviewed), and so on 
that metric performs slightly worse.
The Archbishop's intervention has certainly caused a stir, and the BrandIndex scores should give him heart. If the 
former financier can get his idea to support credit unions right, then the underlying poor perception of Wonga 
suggests that the company is vulnerable to a challenge.

Shares in Publicis , the French advertising agency that has plans to merge with US rival Omnicom, climbed as bid 
news helped keep pan-European indices afloat.
The $35bn Franco-US "merger of equals" was signed in Paris on Sunday and, pending shareholder and regulatory 
approval, creates the world's largest marketing company by revenues.
Publicis shares opened for trade at the same time as Omnicom's as New York markets came online and closed 
after two hours of trade up 0.1 per cent to EUR59.40.
Rival media groups rallied in response. France's Havas gained 4.7 per cent to EUR5.66.
Drugmaker Elan jumped 3.7 per cent to EUR11.55 after US rival Perrigo agreed to pay $8.6bn for the Irish 
company.
Completing a trio of deals, Essilor International , the maker of lenses for spectacles, rallied 6.2 per cent to 
EUR85.62 after paying $1.73bn to take full control of Transitions Optical, its joint venture with US company PPG 
Industries.

Meanwhile, KPN , the Dutch telecoms company which merged its German mobile unit with Telefónica Deutschland 
last week, rose after its biggest shareholder, America Movil, ended an agreement that keeps its stake below 30 per 
cent.
Although the company, owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, gave no indication it would raise its stake from 
the current 29.8 per cent, shares in KPN rose 4.6 per cent to EUR1.98.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 0.1 per cent to 1,206.04, with downside pressure from financial stocks keeping a 
lid on overall gains.
Danone , the French food group, climbed 3.2 per cent to EUR59.27 after reporting like-for-like revenue growth of 
6.5 per cent, beating market forecasts.
The maker of dairy products and bottled waters said it saw a surge in sales of baby nutrition products in China.
Ryanair was one of the biggest fallers after Europe's largest low-cost carrier reported a weaker than expected first-
quarter profit. Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to EUR6.97.

Territory: UK Agency: Bottle Verdict: ****
A prince's birth provides a rare opportunity for publicity. And since William arrived 31 years ago, the internet and 
social media have transformed the speed and sophistication with which advertisers can move.
Ryanair, the no-frills airline, offered free flights to infants booked on July 23, the day after the royal birth, with the 
slogan "Ryan-heir." Coca-Cola used its current personalised bottles campaign to feature a toast between two 
bottles marked "Wills" and "Kate".
But it was a small potato crisp brand that earnt the crown for capturing the mood of the event. Golden Wonder, 
owned by Northern Irish foodmaker Tayto Group, sent its packet-shaped mascots to hand out a free bag of crisps to 
anyone queueing third in line - as Prince George is to the throne. In doing so, it married two British institutions: the 
royal family and the queue.
Crisp bags were handed out at cash machines , shops and even lavatories (dubbed "the throne" in British slang).
It was a relatively small stunt, with the same people featuring in some publicity shots because of a shortage of 
those willing to sign consent forms. But the campaign relied on being spread via Facebook and Twitter rather than 
The public image: Golden Wonder's 'third in line' stunt Marketing deconstructed
its scale. This is a smart approach for a brand that dominated the market in the 1980s but lacks the marketing

US drugmaker Perrigo buys Elan for $8.6bn

IRISH biotech firm Elan yesterday accepted an $8.6bn takeover offer from US drug maker Perrigo, just weeks after 
batting off a hostile approach from Royalty Pharma.
Perrigo will pay $6.25 per share in cash plus $10.25 per share in stock for Elan, in a deal that will see the Michigan 
firm almost halve its effective tax rate as it shifts its domicile to Ireland.
It will also get access to the revenue stream of Elan's blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, which executives 
said yesterday would be used to fund further international expansion.
Perrigo chief executive Joe Papa yesterday called the tie-up a "compelling combination", and said that 
overwhelming support for the deal proved that "in this case, one plus one makes at least three".
By shifting its domicile to Ireland via a holding company to be known as New Perrigo, the US firm will slash its 
effective tax rate from 30 per cent to as low as 17 per cent.
Perrigo said savings from the lower rate and "tax operational synergies" would amount to as much as $150m 
annually.
Perrigo will also take on $1.9bn from Elan's balance sheet, taking the net acquisition price to $6.7bn.
Under Irish takeover rules the deal will need approval from holders of 75 per cent of Elan's share capital, as well as 
the sanction of the Irish High Court. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.
Analysts expect the deal to be welcomed by the Elan shareholders who rejected Royalty's approaches, and who 
yesterday sent its shares 3.68 per cent higher to close at (EURO)11.55.
US drugmaker Perrigo buys Elan for $8.6bn
Papa said Ireland would give Perrigo a gateway into the rest of Europe and saw the Tysabri royalty, worth of up to 
25 per cent on future sales, as a means to fund future opportunities.
Shares in Perrigo - which is dual-listed in New York and Tel Aviv - fell more than six per cent to close at $125.17 on 
the NYSE.
ADVISERS PERRIGO'S BID FOR ELAN COLM DONLON MORGAN STANLEY As Perrigo swooped to purchase 
drugs manufacturer Elan, Morgan Stanley's co-head of M&A in Europe fought for a better deal for the Irish firm.
Colm Donlon brought previous experience of large-scale deals including the £11bn joint venture between Siemens 
and Nokia. Donlon was joined on Elan's side by Eugenee Mulhern, director of corporate finance at Davy. A member 
of the Institute of Directors, Mulhern advised the board of First Active on its acquisition by RBS and Ryanair during 
its pursuit of Aer Lingus.
Advice was also received from Michael Tory, a partner at Ondra LLP, who was previously head of UK investment 
banking at both Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.
In the States, Citi's global head of healthcare Chris Hite was working with Elan. He advised the company earlier this 
year as it spurned a hostile $6.5bn bid from Royalty Pharma. On the other side of the table, Perrigo was advised in 
the UK by Derek Shakespeare, a managing director at Barclays Investment Bank, and overseas by Punit Mehta, a 
managing director in the bank's New York office. By Alex L x Longle ongley

Shire led the risers in a flat London market yesterday as sector consolidation and growth hopes lifted the stock to a 
record high.
Perrigo's $8.6bn agreement to buy Elan , the Irish speciality drugmaker, helped lift Shire 2.4 per cent to £23.82.
Perrigo's price of about 23 times Elan's 2015 operating earnings was nearly double Shire's current valuation on the 
same metrics, said dealers.
Shire has long been considered a takeover target, with the group rumoured to have rejected an opportunistic 
approach from Bristol-Myers Squibb earlier this year.
Expectations of a Barclays cash call held back the wider market, leaving the FTSE 100 up just 5.46 points or less 
than 0.1 per cent at 6,560.25.
Barclays fell 3.5 per cent to 309.1p after it confirmed it was in talks with the bank regulator about its financial and 
capital management plans.
Intertek was down 2.8 per cent to £29.77 after interim results from the testing specialist showed revenue growth 
was slightly below market expectations, due mainly to the further slowing of its minerals business.
Shire hits record high on talk of further pharma bid moves LONDON
WPP edged up 0.6 per cent to £11.82 on hopes it would benefit from client conflicts from the merger of Publicis and 
Omnicom.
Offsetting that was speculation that WPP would step up its search for acquisitions.
BSkyB advanced 1.5 per cent to 834p after Oriel Securities traded a block of 16.7m shares, equivalent to about 1 
per cent of the total, which was priced at 835p apiece.
After the close, BSkyB said Jeremy Darroch and Andrew Griffith, its chief executive and chief financial officer 
respectively, said they had sold a total of 2.28m shares.
Fund managers were under pressure after Aberdeen Asset Management reported £2.5bn of net outflows in June. 
Aberdeen lost 1.3 per cent to 402.5p while Schroders was down 2 per cent to £24.45 and F&C Asset 
Management slid 3.3 per cent to 95.1p.
Man Group faded 1.1 per cent to 82.7p ahead of half-year results on Friday. Morgan Stanley forecast Man to slash 
its interim dividend to 1.3 cents, against 9.5 cents a year ago.
Analysts also expected a dividend cut from Drax , which fell 2.2 per cent to 631.5p a day ahead of results. Citi 
forecast the power station operator to make a 7.2p interim payout, down 50 per cent.
Ryanair 's London-listed shares dropped 3 per cent to EUR6.959 on profit-taking after its quarterly results showed 
a weaker than expected yield. The shares have jumped 49 per cent so far this year.
"The story is beginning to display a tired yield momentum in comparison with peers like easyJet," said Merrill Lynch, 
which downgraded Ryanair to "underperform".

STRIKES in France, soaring fuel costs and an earlier Easter have knocked quarterly profits at budget airline 
Ryanair.
The Irish firm yesterday posted a 21 per cent fall in profits after tax to (EURO)78m (£67.4m) for the three months to 
the end of June. Revenues rose five per cent to (EURO)1.34bn, while fuel costs rose six per cent.
The average fare fell four per cent, which the firm blamed on the Easter getaway falling in the previous quarter, 
putting comparisons with last year in an unfavourable light. But ancillary revenues such as Ryanair's new reserved 
seating pushed revenues per passenger one per cent higher.
Ryanair added that yields on summer bookings have been weaker in recent weeks as a result of the warm weather 
in northern Europe keeping sun-seekers at home.
But the company maintained its forecast for earnings of (EURO)570m to (EURO)600m in the year to the end of 
March 2014, compared to last year's record of (EURO)569m.
Analysts at Davy Research said the quarterly figures were in line with market forecasts.

Highlight: Cutbacks by rivals and extra charges for choosing seats helped low-cost airline Ryanair meet forecasts

Body
Cutbacks by rivals and extra charges for choosing seats helped low-cost airline Ryanair meet forecasts with profit of 
78 million euros (dollar 103 million) in the three months to June, the Irish airline said today.
Carriers like Ryanair have been quick to exploit gaps in the market left by higher-cost rivals like British Airways, 
owned by IAG, and Air France-KLM cutting short-haul routes due to fuel costs and weak consumer confidence.
That helped push shares in Europe's biggest budget airline to an all-time high in June. British budget rival easyjet's 
stock also hit its highest ever last week after it reported a bumper spring season.
Ryanair benefited in its first quarter from an increase in so-called "ancillary" charges, particularly the roll-out of 
advance booking for specific seats across the network, allowing passengers to bypass an unruly rush at departure 
gates. "We've been pleasantly surprised with the uptake - passengers want reserved seats," Chief Financial Officer 
Howard Millar told Reuters. Net profit compared with a forecast of 78 million euros in a poll of over 20 analysts by 
the company and was 21 percent lower than a year ago. The Dublin-based airline, famous for its no-frills service, 
maintained its forecast for earnings of 570-600 million euros in its full year to end-March 2014, versus last year's 
record of 569 million euros. The airline, however, said its average fares fell 4 percent due to the timing of Easter 
and impact of air traffic control strikes in France, while non-ticket income from extras such as baggage and 
reserved seating rose 25 percent. ( C ) Reuters

Ryanair benefited in its first quarter from an increase in so-called "ancillary" charges, particularly the roll-out of 
advance booking for specific seats across the network, allowing passengers to bypass an unruly rush at departure 
gates. "We've been pleasantly surprised with the uptake - passengers want reserved seats," Chief Financial Officer 
Howard Millar told Reuters. Net profit compared with a forecast of 78 million euros in a poll of over 20 analysts by 
the company and was 21 percent lower than a year ago. The Dublin-based airline, famous for its no-frills service, 
maintained its forecast for earnings of 570-600 million euros in its full year to end-March 2014, versus last year's 
record of 569 million euros. The airline, however, said its average fares fell 4 percent due to the timing of Easter 
and impact of air traffic control strikes in France, while non-ticket income from extras such as baggage and 
reserved seating rose 25 percent.

Cutbacks by rivals and extra charges for choosing seats helped low-cost airline Ryanair meet forecasts with profit of 
78 million euros in the three months to June, the Irish airline said today.
Carriers like Ryanair have been quick to exploit gaps in the market left by higher-cost rivals like British Airways, 
owned by IAG, and Air France-KLM cutting short-haul routes due to fuel costs and weak consumer confidence.
That helped push shares in Europe's biggest budget airline to an all-time high in June. British budget rival easyjet's 
(EZJ.L) stock also hit its highest ever last week after it reported a bumper spring season.

The ISEQ gained ground this morning, lifted by shares in Elan after news that a US group is to buy the Irish drug 
developer for E6.5bn.
U.S. drugmaker Perrigo has agreed to buy Elan for dollar 8.6 billion (E6.5bn) today in a deal that will hand it tax 
savings from being domiciled in Ireland and royalties from a blockbuster multiple sclerosis treatment. It ends a bitter 
takeover battle in which Elan rejected three lower bids from U.S. investment firm Royalty Pharma ROYPH.UL amid 
injunctions, court hearings and a war of words before putting itself up for sale last month. Michigan-based Perrigo, 
which makes over-the-counter pharmaceuticals for the in-store brand market and has a market value of some dollar 
12 billion, will pay dollar 6.25 per share in cash plus dollar 10.25 per share in stock, a premium of about 10.5 
percent over Elan's closing price on Friday. Elan shares shot up 11pc at opening trades today to E12.4 and settled 
at E12.14, up 100c by lunchtime in line with a bid that analysts expect will be snapped up by shareholders who 
rejected Royalty's successive overtures.
Elsewhere, Ryanair recorded Q1 net profits of E78.1m, down on last year's E98.8m as expected (due to higher fuel 
costs and Easter in the prior year comparable) and in-line with market expectations (Davy E73.8m, consensus 
E78m). Full year FY2014 net profit guidance remains unchanged at E570-600m (Davy E590m, consensus E643m). 
We are unlikely to change forecasts. We continue to rate Ryanair 'Outperform' with an E8 price target. Ryanair's 
shares fell 20c to E6.97.

earnings news and M&A activity. The Asian markets ended mostly lower and the U.S. index futures point to a lower 
open.
House price inflation in the UK eased in July as demand from first-time buyers weakened at the start of summer 
holidays, a survey by Hometrack revealed. Average value of a house in England and Wales increased 0.3 percent 
month-on-month in July, slower than a 0.4 percent gain in June. London continued to drive overall house price 
growth with prices rising 0.7 percent.
Over the weekend, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that growth in China's industrial profits 
eased in June mainly due to a slower growth in business revenue.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is adding 0.36 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is gaining 0.34 percent.

Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX and Switzerland's SMI are in the red while the French CAC 40 is rising 
moderately.
Across Asia/Pacific, markets ended in negative territory, led by Japan's Nikkei 225 which lost 3.3 percent. China's 
Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.7 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. 
Australia's All Ordinaries managed to end marginally higher.
In the U.S., futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks showed a substantial 
recovery over the course of the trading session after coming under pressure in morning trading. The Dow inched up 
less than a tenth of a percent, the Nasdaq rose 0.2 percent and the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent.

the National Audit Office said "in line with a request of the State Council, the NAO will organize auditing agencies 
across the country to carry out an audit of government debt."

economists had forecast, latest data showed Monday.
The seasonally adjusted business confidence index, which refers to manufacturers' assessment of their business 
conditions, advanced to 91.7 in July from the previous month's revised score of 90.5, statistical office Istat said. 
Economists expected the index to move up to 91 from June's originally reported 90.2.

British retailers expect sales volumes to rise again in the year through August, after recording its first rise in five 
months in July, the latest monthly Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) 
showed Monday.
The survey pointed out that 39 percent of firms expect an increase in sales volumes in August compared with 29 
percent predicting a decline. This resulted in a rounded balance of 10 percent.
Pending home sales in the U.S. saw a modest decrease in the month of June, according to a report released by the 
National Association of Realtors on Monday, with pending sales pulling back off their highest level in over six years.
NAR said its pending home sales index edged down 0.4 percent to 110.9 in June from a downwardly revised 111.3 
in May. Economists had been expecting the index to drop by about 1.4 percent.

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Monday reported lower profit for the first 
quarter, despite higher revenues, due to higher fuel costs and the timing of Easter. The firm backed its full year 
outlook.
Profit for the quarter - attributable to equity holders of parent fell 21 percent to 78.1 million euros from 98.8 million 
euros. Earnings per share dropped to 5.40 euros from 6.83 euros.
Profit before tax decline to 88.5 million euros from 112.5 million euros. Passengers climbed 3 percent to 23.2 
million.
Total operating revenues from continuing operations increased 5 percent to 1.342 billion euros from 1.284 billion 
euros, helped by higher ancillary revenues.
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said, "As previously guided higher fuel costs and the timing of Easter led to Q1 
profits falling ?21m to ?78m. Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to ?357m (27% of total revenues) driven by the 
successful development of reserved seating, priority boarding, and higher admin\credit card fees.''
Looking ahead, the firm expects second-quarter yields to rise despite last year's challenging comparables, although 
yields on close-in summer bookings have been slightly weaker in recent weeks due to the heat wave in Northern 
Europe.
The airline's outlook remains cautious for the full year as market conditions are tough with recession, austerity, high 
fuel costs, and excessive Government taxes impacting air travel demand and yields.
Ryanair expects full year traffic to grow 3 percent to 81.5 million and it still has no visibility over next winter's yields.
On the basis that the recent yield weakness in close-in summer bookings does not continue, the airline said it sees 
no reason to change its full year profit after tax guidance which remains at between 570 million euros to 600 million 
euros.

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) Monday reported a sharp decline in profit 
for the first quarter as higher fuel costs, and lower fares due to the timing of Easter offset higher traffic and strong 
ancillary revenues. The company also backed its full year outlook.
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said, "As ever, our outlook remains cautious for the full year as market conditions 
are tough with recession, austerity, high fuel costs, and excessive Government taxes (most recently in Belgium) 
impacting air travel demand and yields. While we expect full year traffic to grow 3 percent to 81.5m, we still have no 
visibility over next winter's yields..."
On the basis that the recent yield weakness in close-in summer bookings does not continue, the airline said it sees 
no reason to change its full year profit after tax guidance which remains at between 570 million euros to 600 million 
euros.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, the company's profit was 569.3 million euros.
For the first quarter, profit attributable to equity holders of parent fell 21 percent to 78.1 million euros from 98.8 
million euros. Earnings per share dropped to 5.40 euros from 6.83 euros.
Profit before tax declined to 88.5 million euros from 112.5 million euros.
Total quarterly operating revenues from continuing operations increased 5 percent to 1.342 billion euros from 1.284 
billion euros, as 1.2 percent drop in scheduled revenues were more than offset by a 25 percent surge in ancillary 
revenues.
The company noted that ancillary revenues were driven by the successful development of reserved seating, priority 
boarding, and higher admin\credit card fees.
Traffic, measured in passenger numbers, increased 3 percent to 23.2 million from 22.5 million last year. Meanwhile, 
average fares fell 4 percent due to the timing of Easter and the impact of the June French ATC strikes.
Total revenue per passenger increased 1 percent on strong ancillary growth, while load factor remained flat at 82 
percent compared to last year.
Ryanair Q1 Profit Down 21%, Backs Forecast
In the quarter, operating margin decreased 2 points to 8 percent whilst operating profit decreased 22 percent to 
103.3 million euros.
Total operating expenses increased 8 percent to 1.24 million euros due to a 6 percent growth in fuel prices, the 
higher level of activity and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline. Unit costs excluding fuel 
increased 6 percent, slightly faster than the increase in sector length.
Looking ahead, the company said it expects second-quarter yields to rise despite last year's challenging 
comparables, although yields on close-in summer bookings have been slightly weaker in recent weeks due to the 
heat wave in Northern Europe.
In London, Ryanair shares are currently trading at 7 euros, down 0.17 euros or 2.43 percent.

new leverage requirement. Analysts are keen to find out more detail about the kind of action the bank plans to take 
in order to boost its equity - or reduce its asset base to the required level.
Corporate Diary INTERNATIONAL/UK
Analysts expect underlying profit of about £2bn, which will predominantly be driven by the investment banking 
division. Investec Securities forecasts earnings per share of 7.6p for the second quarter, up from 6.7p in the first 
three months.
There will also be interest in any outstanding regulatory issues after Barclays was fined for manipulating prices in 
the US energy market this month. The bank refused to pay the fine and said it would vigorously defend the matter in 
federal courts.
  Fiat is expected to report a year-on-year fall in net profit to EUR305m in the second quarter as Europe's economic 
woes and structural overcapacity continue to weigh on the Italian carmaker, writes Rachel Sanderson .
The group, which owns a majority of US carmaker Chrysler, will see net profit down from EUR348m a year ago, 
according to a poll of analysts by the company. Trading profit is seen in line with last year at about EUR1bn. Net 
industrial debt is expected to have swelled by nearly EUR2bn year-on-year to EUR7.2bn.
Investors are looking for an update from Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, on the timing of 
Fiat completing its buyout of Chrysler, the conclusion of which depends on a court decision on how much it should 
pay Veba, a union medical retirement trust that owns the 41.5 per cent of Chrysler not already acquired by Fiat.
New car sales in the EU last month fell 5.6 per cent year on year as sluggish growth and high unemployment 
continued to sap demand. Fiat, Peugeot-Citroen and General Motors were hardest hit.

  IAG will release its half-year earnings and investors will be looking for signs of progress at Iberia, the group's 
struggling Spanish airline, writes Jane Wild .
Pre-tax losses at Iberia widened to EUR670m in the first quarter, after EUR311m of exceptional items relating to its 
restructuring, aimed at getting it on a nimbler footing against rivals. Unions strongly resisted the job losses, which 
will total 3,300 rather than the 4,500 Iberia proposed last year. Analysts will want to see tensions between pilots and 
management resolved.
BA, which merged with Iberia in 2011 to form IAG, also recorded an operating loss last quarter compared with the 
same period a year previously, though slightly reduced at £58m. But it signalled last month it was moving towards 
making a maiden dividend.
The analyst consensus for its half year is an operating profit of EUR163m, before exceptional items for the quarter.

Ryanair shares are sliding after Europe's biggest budget airline reported lower first-quarter profits and said the 
current quarter could be weaker, too, if a summer of exceptional sunshine continues in Britain and Ireland.
The Dublin-headquartered airline said Monday its net profit for the April-June period fell 21 percent to 78 million 
euros ($103.5 million). Fuel costs rose 6 percent.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also blamed June strikes by French air traffic controllers and an unusually early 
Easter holiday in March for driving down quarterly business.
He says current bookings also are weaker than expected because typically sun-starved Britain and Ireland, the 
airline's two biggest bases, have been hot and dry for most of July.
Ryanair shares fell more than 3 percent Monday to a two-month low of 6.93 euros ($9.19).

Buying and selling of Irish-listed companies that trade on American financial markets doubled in the first six months 
of the year, according to data compiled by BNY Mellon, the largest custodial bank in the world.
Figures for the first half of 2013 show a more than 100 per cent increase in both volume and value over the same 
period last year of ADR shares traded in Irish companies. ADRs, or American depositary receipts, are dollar-
denominated certificates that allow American investors to buy and sell shares in foreign companies using their 
home currency.
Between January and June of this year, 1.25 billion ADR shares with a value of $16.43 billion were traded in Irish 
companies. This compares to 604 million shares traded with a value of $8 billion in the first six months of 2012.
Irish companies that operate ADR programmes include CRH, Elan, Bank of Ireland, Kerry Group, Greencore and 
Ryanair.
The top Irish performer in terms of uplift is Ryanair with a 50 per cent increase to 43.56 million shares, traded at a 
value of $1.86 billion.
Elan was one of the most actively traded US-listed depositary receipts globally in the first six months of the year 
with 1.07 billion shares traded, compared to 855 million for the whole of last year, with a value of $12.85 billion as 
investors moved in and out of the stock during Royalty Pharma's three-month takeover bid for the company.
Bank of Ireland, which was the top performer in the first half of last year, still performed well with 85.61 million 
shares traded at a value of $752 million.

Positive financial figures from Easyjet last week suggest that Ryanair's first quarter financial results due tomorrow 
could outperform expectations and provide a share price boost to the company, according to a number of aviation 
analysts.
Goodbody analyst Donal O'Neill said that he was already more optimistic than the company's relatively downbeat 
guidance, but a key issue will be whether recent hot weather in Britain and Ireland has cut into profitable last-minute 
bookings.
Analysts' consensus for the quarter is for sales of EUR 1.349 billion and net profit before exceptional items of EUR 
78 million. For the full year, analysts' consensus is for sales of EUR 5.254 billion and net profit before exceptional 
items of EUR 643 million.The company has previously said that higher fuel costs and lower yields due to the timing 
of Easter will hit results. It also said average fares are likely to fall by 3 per cent, although O'Neill said the fall could 
be less than 1 per cent.
"If Ryanair is to beat expectations, it is likely to be either on pricing or on the take-up of allocated seats," said 
O'Neill.
Earlier in the week, Easyjet announced 6.1 per cent growth in revenue per seat, a key indicator.
"The two airlines are not directly comparable because they operate in different markets in many cases. But broadly 
speaking, as a trend, you might see a surprise from Ryanair on Monday if Easyjet is anything to go by," said O'Neill, 
a view also expressed by other analysts. "If they do surprise, it will be on either pricing or on the take up of 
allocated seating and this could see the stock react very positively.  "
Nevertheless, O'Neill said there are indications that local tour operators have suffered a hit due to the recent spell 
of good weather and this could also impact Ryanair.
"But if Ryanair can assuage any fears . . then the stock could react very favourably.  "

Nicole Buckler is editor of annual Irish magazine Old Moore's Almanac, which celebrates its 250th anniversary this 
November.
Based in Bray, the magazine sells 45,000 copies of its print issue and also has online editorial at 
oldmooresalmanac.com. Originally from Australia, Buckler moved to Ireland in 2001 and has been editor of the 
magazine since 2009.
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
I write editorial for the magazine, pulling it all together from start to finish alongside the production editor. I also write 
an article a day for the website. These can cover topics as wide-ranging as the burning of Irish witches to stumbling 
into a turlough and making mackerel pâté. Using croissants, coffee and sometimes a drop of whiskey, I bribe our in-
house psychic to give us as many predictions as possible. They are the most viewed part of our website and get 
hits from all over the world. We have had an amazing psychic since 2010, who is getting us some great press at the 
moment.
**What motivates you in your job?**
This job is always fun and I know a fun job from a terrible job, because I have had some deeply stupid jobs in my 
time. My favourite part of this job is looking after our social media, including our Facebook page and Twitter. People 
interact with us on social media and say the funniest things.
**How would you describe your work style?**
Working Week
I can never turn my brain off, I am always thinking of new ways to try to be awesome at work. I lie in bed at night 
trying to think of the most interesting editorial ideas possible. It is difficult to be interesting and fresh all the time, but 
I get inspiration from all the mental things that go on in Ireland. That said, I don't multi-task. I do one thing at a time.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned so far?**
Something will always go wrong on deadline day. Like when the printing presses break, or the cover turns out to be 
blue instead of green, or the graphic designer is in hospital having their appendix extracted. I create two deadlines: 
one fake and one real. The fake one is just a reason to get theatrically hysterical so that when the hardcore 
deadline comes along, everything should be solved and all the fires put out.
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire and why?**
I love the style of Michael O'Leary, overlord of Ryanair. He just doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks of 
him. Flying with Ryanair feels like a minor assault, but he has turned flight into something as regular and as cost-
effective as an intercity bus service.
**Based on your experience, what is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
Don't mess with an editor on deadline day.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge?**
I think a big deal right now is convincing business owners and marketers that it is safe to advertise again. In the 
good times, it didn't matter if advertising didn't work, because people were selling loads of "shiz" no matter what. 
Now people are a lot more careful with their marketing budget, but you need to spend money to make money, and 
properly targeted advertising still works.
**What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?**
To be able to keep juggling a very enjoyable job with my family life, with lots of fun and sneaky whiskeys on the 
side.

Beware the hidden costs of holiday travel

Hidden travel costs can add up, so take care to read the small print when booking tickets. Whether you are 
staycationing, heading abroad on holidays or just travelling to another part of the country for a wedding or family 
commitment, travel can significantly increase the cost of your trip. Make sure you factor it into your travel budget 
alongside accommodation, food, entertainment and so on.
Here's a flavour of the type of fees you might have to pay. This is by no means an exhaustive list, so make sure to 
fully understand the terms and conditions of your travel booking before you commit. Look carefully at fees and 
make sure you understand exactly how much you will have to pay.
**Air**
Dublin Airport handled 19.1 million passengers in 2012, up 2 per cent on 2011, according to the Dublin Airport 
Authority (DAA). If, like them, you intend to take to the skies in the coming weeks, take care when booking your trip.
Baggage fees, priority boarding charges and other fees can really add up and leave air passengers facing a much 
higher fare than they initially expected. You might see a flight offer for EUR 9.99. However, the first tip for airline 
passengers is to look beyond the headline price. Compare prices based on the final price, including all taxes, 
charges, baggage fees and so on.
One of the biggest add-ons is often for baggage. Aer Lingus charges between EUR 15 and EUR 25 for a checked 
bag on a short-haul flight, if booked online. The cost rises to up to EUR 45 if you check in the bag when you arrive 
at the airport. With Ryanair, it costs between EUR 15 and EUR 45 for a checked bag if booked online when booking 
the initial flight. If you decide later to add a bag to your online booking, prices range from EUR 20 to EUR 60 per 
bag. And, for those who wait until reaching the airport to check a bag in, you will be charged between EUR 60 and 
EUR 160.
Be mindful of luggage limits, as excess baggage fees per kilo will further increase the cost of your trip.
Beware the hidden costs of holiday travel
Travelling with bulky items could mean even higher fees. For example, Ryanair will transport one pushchair per 
infant free of charge, but will charge EUR 10 per item per flight, if booked online, for additional infant equipment, 
such as car booster seats and travel cots. Transporting sports equipment, such as golf clubs or surf boards, will 
also inflate the cost of your trip. For example, Aer Lingus charges EUR 30 for such items for each leg of your 
journey, if booked online. If you pay at the airport on day of departure, the fee increases to EUR 40.
Choosing when you get on the plane and where you sit can also increase costs. For online bookings, Ryanair 
charges EUR 10 for seat selection and EUR 7 for priority boarding. With Aer Lingus, seat selection fees vary from 
EUR 5 to EUR 25 on short-haul flights.
**Sea**
Bringing your car abroad may seem like an easier holiday option than struggling to pack all your family needs for a 
holiday into a tiny suitcase to circumvent baggage fees. If so, then a ferry might be your transport of choice.
However, there are still some fees to watch out for when travelling by sea. For example, changing a booking can 
increase your holiday costs. With Irish Ferries, amendment fees, plus any increase in fare, apply to changes to 
route, date or time.
For motorist bookings, a EUR 25 amendment fee applies for each leg of the journey, and for foot passengers, the 
charge is EUR 10 for each leg of the journey amended.
Passengers travelling with Stena Line face amendment fees of EUR 25 per sailing if they buy an economy ticket 
and change their travel plans. Dearer tickets come with no amendment fees.
Unlike airline passengers, ferry passengers pay to get off the boat first rather than board first. With Irish Ferries, a 
limited "speedy exit" option to motorists on its Ireland-France service is available at a cost of EUR 10 per journey. 
"We guarantee that your vehicle will be one of the first 20 cars or motorbikes to disembark from the ship on arrival 
in port," the ferry company's website states.
**Bus and rail**
While those taking to the skies face an array of fees and charges, you should also be mindful of travel costs when 
opting to stay closer to home.
Passengers travelling with Bus Eireann can place up to 15kg of luggage in the luggage compartment of the bus free 
of charge, and may also carry one small item of hand luggage free of charge inside the bus. "Any additional 
luggage may only be carried if, in the opinion of Bus Eireann, there is sufficient accommodation available," a 
spokeswoman said. She added that such additional luggage may be subject to an additional charge "as determined 
by Bus Eireann from time to time".
As with airlines, transporting bulky items will result in an additional charge. Bus Eireann will transport children's 
folding pushchairs free, but folding bicycles that are not packed in a suitable carrier bag or protective covering will 
cost EUR 10 per single journey to transport.
Train passengers do not face any baggage fees, unless they want to bring their bike. Transporting a bike will cost 
EUR 6 per journey with Irish Rail, if booked online. "Bicycle fees range between EUR 2.50 and EUR 8 each way if 
booked at a station," a spokesman for Irish Rail said. "The website has a flat rate, the station charge varies by 
distance of journey."
Changing to an alternative train could result in an additional charge if you have a pre-booked ticket with Irish Rail. 
"Online bookings can be changed to a different service on the date of journey for a EUR 10 surcharge, payable at 
the station," the spokesman said. "Day returns and open returns -- within 30 days -- purchased at the station have 
flexibility within the validity of the ticket."

**Fingers crossed for Q2**
Money in, money out. You might think the exchequer finances are designed to confuse. (And you might be right!)
As they head off for their August break, ministers have been arguing about how a bit of room for manoeuvre in the 
budget should be spent. The question is whether it will be there when they get back in September.
We all know the promissory note saves EUR 1 billion and that we could allocate some or all of this elsewhere and 
still meet our targets of cutting borrowing to 5.1 per cent of GDP in 2014. Or that's the story. The trouble is that slow 
growth will start to chip away at this -- and quickly. It seems to me that, unless the second quarter economic figures 
are better, flexibility will start to shrink rapidly. With a growth forecast cut by 0.5 per cent, you could lose EUR 400 
million to EUR 500 million pretty quickly.
There will be one-offs too. More costs may emerge from the IBRC wind-up next year, though most will go off the 
balance sheet into Nama. The sale of Bord Gáis will provide some cash for the 2013 figures, some of which I 
presume will carry forward to investment for 2013. Bank of Ireland may well give the state EUR 1.8 billion early next 
year to buy out the state's preference shareholding before the March 2014 deadline, beyond which its liability to the 
government would increase. With the pension reserve fund being wound up, this cash would probably go to pay 
down debt. And the state would retain a 15 per cent ordinary shareholding to get any future upside.
But the first thing ministers and advisers will ask at the end of August is what the growth numbers look like. There is 
some hope in the government and the troika that the first quarter figures -- showing a GDP dip -- were a one-off. If 
the figures look a bit brighter, there will be a row over how to use the room for manoeuvre. If not, then the game will 
change. Borrowing and debt are both measured as a percentage of GDP, and we need GDP to start rising to make 
it easier.
.........................
Cliff Taylor on our economic figures, Borde Gáis and Ryanair
**Full steam ahead for Bord Gáis**
Bord Gáis will sell. But at what price? Perhaps a good deal less than the earlier estimates for up to EUR 1.5 billion.
From a large initial field, NewEra, the branch of NTMA selling the network business of Bord Gáis, has narrowed the 
field down to three. This would be one or two fewer than expected, suggesting that a certain level of bid was 
required to get through the "group stages". One might speculate that the figure was around EUR 1 billion in terms of 
the value of the enterprise. Remember, however, that there is around EUR 400 million in debt on the company's 
balance sheet and, assuming this all transfers to the bit being sold, the actual amount of new equity for the state will 
be that much less.
There should still be some competitive tension in the bidding process, providing the three final bidders all hang in. 
Viridian, the biggest player in the North and with an electricity operation expanding from corporate to retail in the 
Republic, has a clear strategic interest. Centrica, which owns British Gas -- Britain's biggest energy provider -- was 
the early favourite. Tenaga, the Malaysian energy company with its eye on international expansion, is the third 
short-listed bidder.
It looks likely that at least some of the shortlist will combine with financial players who will be offered a shareholding 
in the bids. In particular, there will be close attention paid to the possible involvement of US fund Blackstone, who 
had been suggested as a possible solo bidder and could now link up with one of the three.
It will come down to who offers the most cash. The gas regulation bill went through government this week which will 
effectively allow the generation and retail part of the business to be split away from the network, which is not being 
sold, and set up a framework for how this will work. So it is full steam ahead.
.........................
**More Ryanair carry-on**
The headlines said that Ryanair was offering to sell its stake in Aer Lingus. Well, kind of. Michael O'Leary did 
indeed offer to sell his 29 per cent stake, but only if another EU airline bidder managed to get other shareholdings 
representing 50.1 per cent of the equity to sell to it first. That would effectively mean a bidder getting buy-in from the 
government, which holds 25 per cent, and more than half of the other disparate shareholders.
The obvious conclusion is that the move was tactical and designed to put a shot across the bows of the UK 
Competition Commission, due to rule by early September at the latest, whether Ryanair should be forced to sell 
some or all of its stake on competition grounds. In a preliminary decision, the commission said that it felt the holding 
could hinder competition and could stop another potential bidder trying to make an offer.
Ryanair points out that the EU Commission found, in its recent examination of the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, that 
competition had actually increased between the two in recent years -- though of course it ruled against the bid on 
the basis of its fears that a merger would lead to a gouging of consumers. Ryanair says its latest move shows that 
the competition commission can no longer hold that a bid for Aer Lingus is being blocked.
This is true, though there isn't a long line of likely bidders. Willie Walsh's IAG would be the only obvious one -- so 
far he has not made a move. A non-EU airline cannot buy more than half of Aer Lingus. So realistically Etihad's 
ambitions would only stretch to buying the government's stake, unless it teamed up with Air Berlin, the airline in 
which it holds 29 per cent. The big question is whether Christoph Mueller's Aer Lingus can remain independent as 
the inevitable change in its share register gets under way. To squeeze Ryanair, Mueller needs to find a friendly 
buyer for the government stake.

European equity market gains were largely results-driven yesterday, with the best performances coming from the 
likes of Edenred and Volvo, and other companies raising their targets for the full year.
Edenred , the French voucher and prepaid card operator, climbed 7.1 per cent to EUR24.34 after reporting a 7.7 
per cent rise in first half operating profit thanks to strength in its Latin American markets.
It also forecast full-year core earnings of between EUR370m and EUR390m, up from EUR367m last year.
"This is slightly better than we expected and reflects a continuation of current business trends," said James Ainley 
at Citigroup.
Volvo , the Swedish truckmaker, gained 5 per cent to SKr97.90 after reporting profit and order growth in its second 
quarter, thanks to a recovery in demand in most of its main markets. The company said order books had grown in 
recent months, and that it was looking to increase production in the third quarter.
Better than expected results for British budget airline easyJet helped boost European carriers. Ireland's Ryanair 
added 4.8 per cent to EUR7.37, as Air France-KLM rose 2.6 per cent to EUR6.22.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,214.63. Banks added some weight to the advance, with 
Austria's Erste Bank up 5.8 per cent to EUR22.32. French bank BNP Paribas added 3.5 per cent to EUR47.28.
Edenred and Volvo gain on good results; EUROPE
Syngenta , the world's biggest agricultural chemicals maker, was the weakest stock on the Eurofirst after it said the 
poor spring weather had hit its earnings in the first half. The shares fell 4 per cent to SFr371, in spite of it issuing a 
confident second half outlook.
KPN , the Dutch telecoms group, was again among the winners as brokers commented on Telefónica 
Deutschland's deal to buy KPN's E-Plus German mobile network. Berenberg raised its price target on KPN from 
EUR1.45 to EUR2.05, while S&P raised its from EUR1.60 to EUR2. Shares in KPN rose 5.2 per cent to EUR1.95, 
but Telefónica edged 0.1 per cent lower to EUR10.28 after its quarterly results showed a slowdown in Brazil had 
dented profits.

EasyJet's Plc's strategy of adding flights on routes where rivals have cut back paid off on Wednesday, as its 
forecast of earnings ahead of analyst expectations helped propel its shares to a record high.
Rival airlines have been struggling with high fuel costs and weak consumer confidence, sending some smaller 
carriers out of business while the likes of British Airways owner IAG and Air France-KLM have cut routes, leaving 
gaps that low-cost airlines have been quick to exploit.
Luton, southern England-based easyJet said it expects pretax profit of between 450 million pounds (dollar 691.5 
million) and 480 million in the year to Sept. 30, up from 317 million last year and topping an average estimate of 433 
million.
EasyJet, whose planes decorated with the company's distinctive orange logo are a common sight at Luton and 
other British airports, said its upbeat forecast assumed a 6 percent rise in revenue per seat in the second half of the 
year. Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier after Ryanair Holdings Plc also said revenue rose 10.5 percent to 
1.14 billion pounds in the three months through June. EasyJet, which increased capacity by 3.6 percent in the 
quarter, said it had particularly benefited from adding flights on routes to Italy and Switzerland. Earlier this month it 
won shareholder approval to buy 135 new Airbus planes despite opposition from its estranged founder Stelios Haji-
Ioannou. MORE FLIGHTS "This stronger than expected performance was driven by allocating capacity to higher-
returning routes, competitor retrenchment and allocated seating," said analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue at brokerage 
Jefferies. Since Carolyn McCall took over as CEO in 2010, the airline has introduced more flights between top 
business destinations, as well as flexible tickets allowing passengers to change their flight up to two hours before 
scheduled departure time, and allocated seating in an attempt to steal corporate customers. The airline's annual 
dividend and profits have doubled since McCall took the helm. "EasyJet is performing strongly, driven by a 
combination of management initiatives and a benign capacity environment," said McCall, adding 73 percent of 
Easyjet in positive forecast Easyjet
seats had already been booked for the six months to October. EasyJet, which makes its profit in a second half that 
includes the busy summer holidays, said revenue per seat rose 6.1 percent at constant currency rates in the 
quarter. It also expects its fuel bill for the second half to be around 9 million pounds less than the same period a 
year ago due to hedging initiatives. Shares in easyJet, which have risen more than 75 percent this year, hit an all-
time high of 1,449 pence in early trade and were 6.4 percent up at 1,422 pence by 0750 GMT, valuing the company 
at around 5.6 billion pounds. EasyJet's founder, usually known as Stelios, set up the airline in 1995 but quit the 
board in 2010 after a row over strategy and remains at odds with its management. He had argued that the money it 
plans to spend on new planes would have been better lavishing on improved dividends or share buybacks. (C )

Ryanair has agreed to sell its minority stake in Aer Lingus to any EU airline interested in the company in a last-ditch 
effort to stave off regulatory action from UK competition authorities .
Europe's largest low-cost airline by revenue yesterday said it would unconditionally sell its 29 per cent holding in its 
Irish rival to any EU airline that wanted to buy Aer Lingus and that obtained acceptances from 50.1 per cent of 
investors.
"This remedy unconditionally removes any ability by Ryanair to block any future takeover of Aer Lingus by another 
EU airline," said Robin Kiely, Ryanair's head of communications.
He said Ryanair's unconditional offer removed "any remaining shred of credibility" from the UK competition 
authorities' investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in its Irish rival.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, told the Financial Times any decision by the UK Competition Commission 
to force the company to sell its minority stake would be appealed against in the courts.
"We won't be rolled over by a bunch of UK amateur regulators," he said. "Our presence on the share register does 
not prevent anyone from buying Aer Lingus."
Ryanair agrees to offload its holding in Aer Lingus
In May the regulator made a provisional ruling , that said allowing Ryanair to keep its stake could reduce 
competition on routes between the UK and Ireland. It also found the stake could hinder another airline's ability to 
buy or merge with Aer Lingus.
The commission is due to decide by September 5 on whether Ryanair should sell all or part of its stake.

European telecoms were boosted yesterday after Dutch group KPN agreed to sell its German mobile unit to Spain's 
Telefónica .
Telefónica Deutschland, the third largest of the four mobile operators in Germany, said it would pay EUR5bn cash 
for E-Plus , KPN's unit and the smallest of the four players in the German market. KPN would also take a stake in 
the enlarged group worth EUR3.1bn.
KPN added 2.8 per cent to EUR1.85, having gained 12.9 per cent in the previous session when news of the offer 
broke. Telefónica gained 2.3 per cent to EUR10.29.
The merger has to be approved by European antitrust authorities, but analysts noted this would bring forward a 
number of positives for other telecoms groups. "Telecom Italia would try again to merge with Hutchison in Italy, 
while TeliaSonera will finally manage to sell Yoigo in Spain," said John Karidis at Oriel Securities.
Telecom Italia was riding high on pan-European indices, up 6.7 per cent to EUR0.52, helped also by talk that it is 
about to receive preliminary approval for its fixed-line network spin off.
Meanwhile, Bouygues , the French conglomerate, topped the FTSE Eurofirst 300 after it said it had entered talks 
with Vivendi on a scheme to share parts of their mobile telecoms networks to help both companies reduce costs.

Bouygues jumped 6.9 per cent to EUR22, while Vivendi, which is in talks to sell its Maroc Telecom stake to Etisalat, 
added 2.4 per cent to EUR16.08.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.3 per cent lower at 1,207.16, with downward pressure from airlines.
BBVA gained 3.4 per cent to EUR6.66 after UBS upgraded the Spanish bank to buy, saying the risks in Spain 
would be mitigated by strength in Latin America.
Swatch Group , the Swiss watchmaker, rose 1.7 per cent to SFr538.50 after saying it expected a strong second 
half following profit growth of 6.1 per cent in the first six months.
Ryanair   fell 3 per cent to EUR7.03 after the Irish budget airline said it would sell its stake in domestic rival Aer 
Lingus to any European airline interested in acquiring the company.

So much for staycations in Cornwall or the Lake District: airline stocks leapt higher on Wednesday as Easyjet put 
paid to concerns that Brits would avoid the budget airline and enjoy a holiday at home.
The FTSE 100-listed carrier announced a strong three months of sales up 10.5% to £1.14 billion in the quarter to 
the end of June while reporting that 73% of plane seats for flights in the second half of the year had been booked.
Easyjet (EZJ.L) shares rose to the top of the FTSE 100, up 5% to £14.05, after the forecast-busting numbers. 
British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) followed with a gain of 2.4% to 292p, while Ryanair was trading up 3.7% to 
7.29.
The gains come after losses yesterday when HSBC analyst Andrew Loddenberg warned 'demand for holiday flights 
will be melting as fast the icecreams on Clacton beach in the current heat wave'.
Instead, the results imply 'market concerns over late bookings may be overplayed,' said analysts at Jefferies, who 
nonetheless prefer shares in Ryanair for its 'sector-leading margins and strong growth'.
Robin Byde of Cantor Fitzgerald noted: 'Easyjet sold off yesterday on concerns about summer bookings; this 
appears unfounded, but the issue remains whether most of this good news is already built-in given the strong 
performance of the stock.'
China stimulus hopes lift FTSE Airlines led broader market gains on Wednesday, even amid more signs of a 
slowdown in the crucial Chinese economy. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.6% to 6,640, in line with gains on other major 
European markets.
HSBC's preliminary reading of manufacturing strength (the flash PMI index) fell to 47.7 in July from 48.2 in June. 
Though the survey reading provides more evidence that the world's second largest economy is slowing, it was 
taken by economists as another sign that China's authorities may have to step in and take action to boost growth.
On the contrary, a strong German PMI reading seemed to be taken on its merits. At 52.8 in July, up from 50.4 in 
June, the number from data company Markit indicated the strongest increase in overall business activity for five 
months.

RYANAIR has offered to sell its stake in Aer Lingus in an effort to prove that owning shares in its Irish rival does not 
stifle competition.
The budget carrier also attacked the UK Competition Commission for its "unfounded and invented" probe into 
Ryanair's 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
As part of its discussions with the watchdog, Ryanair yesterday set out an unconditional pledge to sell out to any 
other EU airline prepared to make a takeover offer for Aer Lingus.
The Competition Commission said in May that it might force Ryanair to sell down its holding after declaring that the 
firm has "the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of Aer Lingus".
Ryanair has made three unsuccessful bids for Aer Lingus since building up its stake in 2006.
"This announcement by Ryanair does not change the game in our view and will not lead to an immediate sale 
unless there is a takeover offer forthcoming. Rather, it gives Ryanair a hook with which to appeal any negative 
decision by the UK CC," said analysts at Goodbody.

The move by Europe's largest budget carrier comes ahead of a ruling by Britain's Competition Commission that

objection to the CC's manifestly false conclusion that Ryanair has influence over Aer Lingus' commercial strategy 
and/or that Ryanair's 6  year old minority shareholding in Aer Lingus has resulted in a lessening of competition. This 
conclusion is flatly contradicted by 6  years of evidence, by the European Commission's findings in February 2013

Lingus and the Irish Government (to the EU), which proves that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus

February 2013 that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified, and by the evidence submitted 
even by Aer Lingus and the Irish Government (to the EU), which proves that competition between Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus intensified to the benefit of consumers over the last 6.5 years," it addded.

Ryanair Offers To Sell Aer Lingus Shareholding To Another EU Airline
Ryanair Offers To Sell Aer Lingus Shareholding To Another EU Airline

Body
(RTTNews) - Irish low cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) confirmed that, as part of its ongoing 
remedies talks with the UK Competition Commission or CC in a case where the CC have produced no evidence 
whatever of any lessening of competition as a result of Ryanair's 61/2 year old 29% interest in Aer Lingus (AERL.L), 
Ryanair has now offered the following undertaking to the CC: To dispel the CC's unfounded and invented "concern" 
that Ryanair's shareholding may prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by another EU airline, Ryanair would 
undertake to unconditionally sell its 29% shareholding to any other EU airline that makes an offer for Aer Lingus 
and obtains acceptances from 50.1% of Aer Lingus shareholders.
This remedy is without prejudice to Ryanair's vehement objection to the CC's manifestly false conclusion that 
Ryanair has influence over Aer Lingus' commercial strategy and/or that Ryanair's 61/2 year old minority stake in Aer 
Lingus has led to a lessening of competition. This conclusion is flatly contradicted by 61/2 years of evidence, by the 
European Commission's findings in February 2013 that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has 
intensified, and by the evidence submitted even by Aer Lingus and the Irish Government, which proves that 
competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus intensified to the benefit of consumers over the last 61/2 years.

 Ryanair, the low-cost Irish airline, is offering to 'unconditionally' sell 29 percent of its shareholdings in Aer Lingus 
(LON:AERL), an Irish-based-carrier, to any other EU airline, the company said Tuesday.
 Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAYP) said it was making the offer "to dispel the unfounded and invented concern that 
Ryanair's shareholding may prevent Aer Lingus from being acquired by another EU airline.'
 The company said that the move follows the UK Competition Commission's conclusion that Ryanair has influence 
over Aer Lingus' commercial strategy, which has resulted in a lessening of competition.
 'This conclusion is flatly contradicted by six-and-a-half years of evidence, by the European Commission's findings 
in February 2013 that competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified,' Ryanair said in the statement.
 The airline said it was willing to sell to any EU airline that makes an offer subject to approval from 50.1 percent of 
Aer Lingus' shareholders.

EasyJet hit a record high after one of the few bears on the stock capitulated.
JPMorgan turned positive on EasyJet with a £15.40 target price - more than double its previous valuation of 625p 
set in April.
The upgrade left only one out of 28 covering brokerages to advise selling the airline, which has been this year's 
biggest blue-chip gainer.
Bankruptcy protection in the US has spurred structural change that has cut the gap between established airlines 
and discount carriers, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said.
The result has been better pricing power, less infighting and a broad acceptance of ancillary fees, all of which have 
been welcomed by investors, he argued.
But without the legal muscle provided by a US-style bankruptcy system, European airlines were unlikely to undergo 
US-style restructuring. As a result, European flag carriers will keep struggling to close the profit gap on the discount 
sector, JPMorgan said.
EasyJet soars to record high with good advances across the board LONDON
"Put bluntly, discounters' inherent cost and operating flexibilities are best put to use when there are infirm operators 
on which to prey, and we see the most opportunity in markets such as France, Italy and Germany," Mr Baker said.
EasyJet rose 4.1 per cent to £14.06, taking its gain for the year so far to 84 per cent.
JPMorgan also turned positive on Ryanair , up 3.3 per cent to EUR7.33 and ahead 56 per cent in the year to date.
In the wider market, a broad-based advance lifted the FTSE 100 to a seven-week high, up 62.43 points, or 1 per 
cent, to 6,634.36.
London Stock Exchange led the blue-chip risers, up 7.4 per cent to £15.90, after its quarterly trading update 
showed organic revenue increasing 8 per cent, at the top end of market expectations.
Advertising agency WPP rose 3.6 per cent to £12.10 after sector peers Omnicom and Publicis both gave cautiously 
positive outlook statements.
Sports Direct added 6.3 per cent to 638p, a record high, on well-received annual earnings and upbeat guidance on 
current trading. The gain gave Sports Direct a market value of £3.6bn, which would put it on the cusp of promotion 
to the FTSE 100 at the next index review.
Vodafone edged 0.5 per cent lower to 191.4p after US partner Verizon posted second-quarter wireless earnings 
that were slightly worse than expected, though it expected customer numbers to improve in the second half.
"This is the first time for several quarters that Verizon Wireless has disappointed and means that Vodafone is more 
exposed to potential earnings downside from its underperforming rump," said Deutsche Bank. "To maximise the 
potential value from its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone should look to sell the asset now."
Man Group lost 1.6 per cent to 87.7p after RBC forecast the fund manager to cut its full-year dividend by 77 per 
cent. Man was likely to report an eighth straight quarter of asset withdrawals, RBC said.
The poor recent performance of AHL, Man's benchmark fund, meant net inflows may fail to materialise in 2014 
which would indicate a value of just 60p per share, it said.
Soco International faded 3.8 per cent to 357.8p on strong volume, which traders said may suggest a setback in 
Vietnam.

The ISEQ is unchanged this morning at 4,015 despite earlier gains on the back of positive European earnings.
Goodbody Stockbrokers looks at Ryanair changes and happenings at various European Airports:
Ryanair has launched livery advertising on its aircraft which will allow companies to display their brand across its 
entire fleet of 300 aircraft. The advertising, to be purchased for a 12 month period, can be placed on the front and 
rear fuselage and inner and outer winglets. We wouldn't expect the revenue from this to be huge, but it's another 
increment on the bottom line. Elsewhere, Ryanair is threatening to reduce traffic by 17pc, or 1m passengers, at 
Brussels Charleroi in response to a proposed E3 ticket tax by the Wallonie Government. Ryanair currently 
represents close to 84pc of traffic at the airport and says its capacity cuts could lead to the loss of 1000 jobs in 
2014. Meanwhile, Wizz Air has decided to make Chopin Airport its permanent base in Warsaw, citing the lack of 
Instrument Landing System and severe disruption costs it has experienced operating at Warsaw's Modlin Airport. It 
also says that 70pc of its passengers prefer Chopin despite the higher fares. Ryanair and Wizz have been 
competing very aggressively on pricing for services to/from Warsaw. This move will reduce that competition and will 
consequently be positive for both airlines while ultimately facilitating additional growth for Ryanair at Modlin airport 
according to Goodbody Stockbrokers.

CARDIFF GETS IRON GRIP ON EUROPEAN SKYBUS
TRAINING Maintenance and flight training organisation Cardiff Aviation has acquired European Skybus flight 
training from European Aviation for an undisclosed sum. Skybus, which will remain on its 13-acre (5ha) site at 
Bournemouth airport "for the time being", has simulators for Boeing 737, 747-200/300 Combi, 747-400, BAC 1-11 
400/500 and Sikorsky S-61. Mario Fulgoni, who founded Cardiff Aviation in 2012 with Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce 
Dickinson, says: "We are likely to incorporate it into our base at St Athan, South Wales in due course."
Kazan composites plant to SUPPLY Superjet
MANUFACTURINg Russia's United Aircraft is to begin producing composite parts including flaps, elevators, rudder 
and fairings for the Sukhoi Superjet 100 at a new, Rb3.5 billion ($105 million) plant in Kazan from the winter of 
2013. The facility, KAPO-Kompozit, will also be adapted to handle manufacturing of components for the Irkut ­MC­
21. Austrian aerostructures firm FACC could become a 24% shareholder in the new facility.
ROLLS-ROYCE SUPPLIER SAVED FROM INSOLVENCY
RESCUE P&S Tools, of Malvern, Worcestershire, has been sold out of administration to undisclosed buyers, 
securing continuity of a business which has been a tier one supplier to Rolls-Royce since 1979. P&S, which still 
occupies its 900m² (9,700ft²) purpose-built premises in Malvern, had closed down but "interest from several parties" 
led to a rescue deal being completed in May 2013, according to Mark Bowen, of MB Insolvency.
AIRLINE Profits to grow 'modestly': Moody's
Air transport A slow US economic recovery and weakness in Europe will continue to weigh on the aviation sector 
during the next 12 to 18 months, but lower fuel costs should offset soft demand and higher non-fuel operating 
expenses, states Moody's Investors Service: "We expect the global airline industry's operating profits to grow 
modestly this year and next. But we do not anticipate a meaningful expansion in profit margins in this time due to 
economic headwinds and capacity additions." Moody's expects large carriers to improve returns, but low-cost 
carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet to struggle to lift profit margins.

GMF initial public offering on hold
MAINTENANCE Indonesian maintenance, repair and overhaul firm GMF AeroAsia has delayed its plans for an 
initial public offering, but could be in a position to launch one by the end of 2013. Chief executive Richard 
Budihadianto says an IPO is now on hold until parent company Garuda Indonesia finalises the timing for the issue. 
However, he stresses that the delay is not having an impact on the company's operations as it has other sources of 
finance available. GMF recorded a net profit of $11 million for the 2012 fiscal year.
Suit Filed Against American-US Airways merger
CONSUMER PROTECTION Consumers represented by anti-trust attorney Joseph Alioto have filed suit to stop the 
proposed merger of American Airlines and US Airways, alleging the combination would create local monopolies and 
result in higher fares, less service and capacity and job cuts. Alioto, who led unsuccessful attempts to block the 
Southwest-AirTran, United-Continental and Delta-Northwest mergers, says: "It would complete the airline cartel, 
giving the top four airlines over 90% control of the US industry."

A Bill that will pave the way for State to tax online gambling will go before cabinet today, sparking speculation that it 
will finally become law by the end of the year.
The Government pledged to extend the existing 1 per cent levy on bets placed in bookie shops to online wagers 
shortly after it took power, but the plan has encountered a series of delays.
The Cabinet is due to discuss the Betting Amendment Bill, which will make this possible, at its meeting today and it 
is likely to give the go-ahead for it to be published.
It will then go to the EU Commission for approval, a process that will take up to three months, and before it goes 
before the Oireachtas later this year to be passed into law. Estimates of the amount of cash the tax will raise for the 
State vary, but the figure is believed to be between E15 million and E17 million. The Irish Times XXXX A 
businessman being pursued by AIB over loans of some E6.2 million is also being pursued by other banks, the 
Commercial Court heard yesterday. Mark Sanfey SC, for Declan Clancy and his wife Louise Daly, argued AIB was 
only now seeking to fast-track its application for judgment against the couple due to concerns other banks might 
"get in ahead" of it. The loan facilities under which the bank was suing expired in March 2011 and AIB was moving 
now in an effort to get a judgment registered against unencumbered properties of his clients, counsel said. The 
bank rejected any culpable delay by it and said it had engaged with the couple in relation to addressing their 
indebtedness. The Irish Times XXXX A survey of chief executives of big companies by PwC shows they are more 
confident now than at any time since 2007. More than half of all executives expect their revenue to grow this year.

Michael O'Leary once strode into a results briefing and explained the absence of his two right-hand men in typically 
colourful fashion.
"I'm here with Howard Miller and Michael Cawley, our two deputy chief executives. But they're presently making 
love in the gentlemen's toilets, such is their excitement at today's results," said the Ryanair boss.
Such a remark might have been enough to tumble a more traditional management structure into the Equality 
Tribunal. But, by all accounts, Michael Cawley -- who last week announced he was stepping down as both deputy 
chief executive and chief operating officer of Ryanair -- has always been more than a match for O'Leary's hurricane-
like personality.
Indeed, sources suggest that the dynamic relationship between the two men has been core to the airline's 
monumental success.
"He will be missed. Cawley has always been well able to pull O'Leary up on issues when needed," said one source.
Once, when O'Leary said in an interview that Ryanair might soon fly transatlantic routes with $12 fares, Cawley 
dismissed his boss's comments just days later.
"That's Michael for you," he said to reporters.
Losing this productive dynamic could be a setback for the airline if it were not managed correctly, said one aviation 
analyst. "The risk for any organisation with such a dominating personality as Michael O'Leary is that he could be 
surrounded by yes-men," said the analyst. "Will Cawley's replacement carry enough stature to challenge O'Leary 
internally?"
Newsmaker: Michael Cawley, Ryanair
The question of who will be the next chief executive of Ryanair has long been a subject for speculation, not least 
because O'Leary has indicated that he might quit before long. Cawley's name -- along with the chief financial 
officer, the aforementioned Howard Miller -- was always top of the list.
But it is likely that, at 59, Cawley realised O'Leary's job might not become vacant in time for him, and that his vast 
experience could be best deployed on the board of Ryanair and other companies.
"Given that they have just done a huge aircraft deal and have another big phase of growth and expansion ahead, 
O'Leary has plenty to keep him interested and motivated. He is only 53," said an analyst.
Nevertheless, O'Leary is likely to miss the affable Corkman, who joined the company in 1997 -- just in time to 
oversee Ryanair's IPO on the Iseq and the Nasdaq.
Since becoming chief operating officer in 2003, Cawley has been heavily involved in negotiating aircraft deals and 
the sales and marketing side.
A key role has been to negotiate with airports around Europe on new routes and new bases, the lifeblood of the 
airline's growth story. Most recently, he led the negotiations that will soon see Ryanair launch in Israel.
But, according to one industry source, Cawley's loss will not be felt as acutely as it would have been in the earlier 
days of the airline's relentless march across the continent.
"The business model is quite straightforward -- be as aggressive as possible on every single cost item," said the 
source. "You obviously need a very good negotiator for this, but it is easier for Ryanair now than it would have been 
ten years ago, given its scale and its track record in the meantime."
These days, when Ryanair enters into negotiations with a small, regional European airport, the airport's 
management personnel know they are in for a rough ride -- regardless of whether it's O'Leary, Cawley or someone 
else from Ryanair sitting across the negotiating table from them.
But they also know that, if they play the Ryanair game, the rewards for their airport in terms of passengers will be 
huge. Only O'Leary himself can take more credit than Cawley for creating such a phenomenal success story.

Kotzebue feasts on large halibut bycatch delivery

Jul 05, 2013 (Alaska Dispatch:http://www.alaskadispatch.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Locals in Kotzebue and surrounding Northwest Alaska villages got a surprise influx of white fish. No, not sheefish. 
The Coast Guard delivered 13,000 pounds of halibut bycatch -- fish that otherwise would have gone to waste -- in 
an effort brought forth by the Washington-based nonprofit SeaShare, and Ocean Beauty Seafoods out of Kodiak. 
Since its inception 20 years ago, SeaShare has donated millions of pounds of seafood to various agencies, 
including food banks, across the country. "SeaShare has been working hard to reach more Northern Alaska 
villages," said executive director Jim Harmon from Washington on Friday. "I was disappointed I didn't get to go to 
Kotzebue. It's such a great community. I wanted to make the handoff to the people who are receiving the fish." 
Nana Regional Corp.'s Liz Moore was there when the C-130 Hercules landed with boxes upon boxes of gutted, 
headed halibut. Moore was recruited to find a crew, divide the fish and facilitate delivery to 10 villages. No small 
task, especially on a tight deadline. "We had to move really fast to mobilize people," Moore said Monday. "We don't 
have a regional food bank." So locals were enlisted to help unload, sort and reload the fish. "I really want to stress 
that this was a partnership between Nana and Maniilaq; we partnered up to get this figured out," Moore said. "We 
looked at the population of each village and estimated how many pieces of fish would go to each village." The 
halibut was divided accordingly between Kotzebue, Deering, Buckland, Selawik, Kiana, Ambler, Kobuk, Shungnak, 
Noorvik, Noatak and Kivalina. It was then flown to the villages thanks to the generosity of FBX, Ryanair, Era 
Aviation and Bering Air, said Moore. The halibut, which was the bycatch from trawlers delivering to Kodiak, was first 
offered to village elders. Once they were taken care of, fish went to various assisted living facilities including Lake 
Street House in Kotzebue. It was then doled out to community members. "People were really excited and they 
really appreciated it," Moore said. "A lot were asking how to cook it," she added with a laugh. Moore added that 
while donations of this nature don't happen very often, especially from Outside sources, it's not unheard of for the 
communities to receive contributions now and then. In 2009, SeaShare donated salmon to Kotzebue and 
surrounding communities. Harmon said SeaShare has a goal of working more with rural Alaska villages but the cost 
of shipping makes it prohibitive. This latest venture was a collaborative effort between SeaShare, Carlile Transport 
and many other companies, including financial support from ConocoPhillips. "No one does this for the tax 
incentive," Harmon said. "They do it because they respect the resource. (Fisheries) really try to avoid bycatch, but 
they feel they should use everything in the catch. This is a way to give back to the communities." The Coast Guard 
was enlisted back in 2009 to make the salmon delivery to Kotzebue, so Harmon contacted them again last week in 
hopes they'd help out again. "It took some time, but they were more than willing to do it," she said. This story first 
appeared in The Arctic Sounder.[1]

Aer Lingus is expanding its long-haul business to boost growth and position Dublin airport as a transatlantic hub as 
it awaits a crucial decision by UK competition authorities on its future ownership.
Yesterday the Irish airline reported a 17.2 per cent increase in passenger numbers on long-haul routes in June, 
compared with the same month last year.
It has announced plans to open new routes to the US and Canada and boost transatlantic capacity by almost a 
quarter next year.
"This is a new chapter for Aer Lingus. We are back to growth mode," said Christoph Mueller, chief executive.
Mr Mueller joined Aer Lingus during a crisis in 2009 - a year when the airline posted a pre-tax loss of EUR155m and 
Ireland plunged into economic turmoil.
He has since cut costs, repositioned the airline towards transatlantic rather than global expansion and returned the 
airline to profit . Aer Lingus made a pre-tax profit of EUR84.4m in 2011 and EUR40.6m in 2012.
Rather than buy its own planes to expand its long-haul fleet, Aer Lingus has agreed a "wet lease" deal with ASL 
Aviation, which will provide aircraft and pilots for the routes.
"This is a lower-risk option for the company," said Joshua Goldman, an analyst with Davy Stockbrokers.
"With the consolidated transatlantic market and good inbound and transfer demand, the expansion of service to 
North America could offer opportunities for the company," he said.
Mr Mueller said Aer Lingus - which is the third-biggest holder of landing slots at Heathrow airport - was on the 
lookout for opportunities to buy more slots.
"A lot of people are very keen to use them for long haul, but that is not for us," he said.
Aer Lingus targets transatlantic growth TRAVEL & LEISURE
He added that the best use of the Heathrow slots for Aer Lingus was as a "conveyor belt" shuttle carrier bringing 
passengers into the hub every hour.
Aer Lingus faces two big challenges in the near-term: Ryanair's refusal to sell its 30 per cent stake in the airline ; 
and potential liabilities related to an employee pension scheme.
The UK competition commission is due to make a ruling on whether Ryanair should be forced to sell its 30 per cent 
stake in its Irish rival by early September.
Removing Ryanair from the share register could open up opportunities for other airlines, including Etihad Airways, 
which has built up a 3 per cent stake in the airline.
But Mr Mueller added that foreign ownership rules, which prevent non-EU airlines from owning more than 49 per 
cent of a European carrier, complicated the situation for airline investors.
"From a buyer's point of view, what do you do with a minority shareholding? You cannot really impose your 
strategy," he said.
"I believe the best solution for Aer Lingus would be for it to just be another airline listed on the stock market like an 
IAG, like Lufthansa, with a widely spread shareholder community and a nice mixture of institutional investors," he 
said.
Mr Mueller said he hoped talks on EU-US free trade would provide a breakthrough on foreign ownership rules.
Aer Lingus is also backing a proposal from Ireland's Labour Court to solve a longstanding row with trade unions 
over a pension scheme that the airline's employees share with other aviation workers.
Under the proposal Aer Lingus would make a one-off EUR140m payment towards employee pensions.
Pension trustees have not yet agreed to the proposal, while Ryanair opposes Aer Lingus making any payment. 
However, Mr Mueller said he was "fairly optimistic" a solution could be agreed.

Body
AIB and Bank of Ireland and at least one more systemically important institution operating here will be regulated 
directly by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt when the new European banking supervisory regime comes into 
force, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan told the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and 
Reform yesterday.
Mr Noonan also reiterated that the Irish banks are well capitalised and said there was no evidence that they would 
need additional funds from the State when a new set of stress tests is completed next year.
When asked by Sinn Fein finance spokesman Pearse Doherty to identify which Irish banks would be directly 
regulated by Frankfurt, Mr Noonan said "AIB and Bank of Ireland will be two. We could have a number of bids on 
the table for the third."
He said the third institution could be Ulster Bank, in spite of the fact that it is owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, 
which is regulated in the UK. It will come down to which banks are considered "systemically important", he added. 
The Irish Times XXXX The National Asset Management Agency is preparing to have a maximum of E23.8 billion in 
loans transferred to it by the special liquidators of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. This is from a book with a 
gross value of E27 billion and suggests that the liquidators will offload loans with a par value of about E4 billion by 
the end of this year, the deadline set by the Government for such sales to happen. These figures represent the 
original value of the loans and do not take account of discounts that might now apply due to the effects of the global 
financial crisis and the collapse of the Irish property market over the past five years. This emerged yesterday from 
the appointment of three companies to manage these loans for Nama when they are transferred by IBRC's 
liquidators. Nama has chosen Certus to manage the portfolio of loans relating to commercial property, residential 
investment and development, and business banking. The Irish Times XXXX Ryanair pilots are squaring up to the

Highlight: AIB and Bank of Ireland and at least one more systemically important institution operating here will be 
regulated directly by the European
Body
AIB and Bank of Ireland and at least one more systemically important institution operating here will be regulated 
directly by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt when the new European banking supervisory regime comes into 
force, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan told the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and 
Reform yesterday.
Mr Noonan also reiterated that the Irish banks are well capitalised and said there was no evidence that they would 
need additional funds from the State when a new set of stress tests is completed next year.
When asked by Sinn Fein finance spokesman Pearse Doherty to identify which Irish banks would be directly 
regulated by Frankfurt, Mr Noonan said "AIB and Bank of Ireland will be two. We could have a number of bids on 
the table for the third."
He said the third institution could be Ulster Bank, in spite of the fact that it is owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, 
which is regulated in the UK. It will come down to which banks are considered "systemically important", he added. 
The Irish Times XXXX The National Asset Management Agency is preparing to have a maximum of E23.8 billion in 
loans transferred to it by the special liquidators of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. This is from a book with a 
gross value of E27 billion and suggests that the liquidators will offload loans with a par value of about E4 billion by 
the end of this year, the deadline set by the Government for such sales to happen. These figures represent the 
original value of the loans and do not take account of discounts that might now apply due to the effects of the global 
financial crisis and the collapse of the Irish property market over the past five years. This emerged yesterday from 
the appointment of three companies to manage these loans for Nama when they are transferred by IBRC's 
liquidators. Nama has chosen Certus to manage the portfolio of loans relating to commercial property, residential 
investment and development, and business banking. The Irish Times XXXX Ryanair pilots are squaring up to the 
company in a fresh effort to force the carrier to engage with a new representative group. The Ryanair Pilot Group 
Roundup-Ir.banks to be regulated by ECB News Roundup
(RPG) - which says it represents over half the airline's roughly 2,500 pilots - has just formed its first council. The 
move marks a significant intensification of efforts to force Ryanair to engage with the group. The move comes just 
as Ryanair - where there is no union presentation among employees - prepares to begin hiring 3,000 new staff, 
including pilots and cabin crew, over the next five years to fuel a major expansion as it starts to take delivery of 175 
new jets. The Irish Independent XXXX US-based Kennedy Wilson has emerged as a major force in Irish property 
thanks to a succession of major acquisitions. It has been attempting to complete a E306m takeover of a portfolio 
that includes the Stillorgan Shopping Centre in Dublin, Merchants Quay Shopping Centre in Cork and a plethora of 
high-end office blocks that include Bank of Ireland's headquarters on Mespil Road in the capital. But its effort has 
been stymied by an alternative offer from US rival Northwood and opposition to the sale from some of the 
bondholders left in control of the assets following a loan default. The Irish Independent XXXX Air passengers in the 
north of England and Scotland are increasingly flying to America via Dublin to avoid Heathrow, according to Aer 
Lingus. The airline said it experienced a 36pc increase in the number of UK passengers flying to North America via 
Dublin in June compared to a year earlier, as it announced it is expanding its long-haul transatlantic business. Aer 
Lingus, which was recently the subject of a takeover bid by rival Ryanair, carries 100,000 UK passengers a year to

Ryanair has contracted John Paul Construction to fit out the airline's new Dublin office building in Swords, a venture 
that will sustain 140 construction jobs this year.
The 100,000 square foot building in Airside Business Park will house all of Ryanair's Irish operations, including its 
commercial, customer service, finance, IT, legal and marketing departments.
Work on the building commenced in late June, sustaining 140 construction and engineering jobs during the 
envisaged 20-week fit-out. The airline remains on course to move all of its Irish office operations and approximately 
400 staff from its current offices at the Dublin Airport to Airside before the end of 2013. Ryanair will continue to 
maintain some facilities at Dublin Airport for its pilots and cabin crew.
Approximately 50,000 square feet of the new office building will be rented to other multi-national companies looking 
for offices with ready access to Dublin Airport. "This is a significant investment by Ryanair, allowing us the space 
and facilities to further develop our Dublin organisation, at much lower costs than the high rents on the Dublin 
Airport campus and allowing other staff currently housed in satellite offices to be brought together under one roof, 
resulting in a large reduction in rental expenses and further cost savings," said Robin Kiely, head of 
communications for Ryanair. By Kellie Cox

British Airways parent IAG and Irish carrier Ryanair both posted rising passenger traffic for June yesterday. IAG 
said revenue passenger kilometres were up 8.2 per cent on a year ago, or 0.1 per cent when recent acquisitions 
such as BMI Baby are stripped out. Its Spanish division Iberia continues to struggle, with total traffic down 18 per 
cent, offsetting BA's 3.6 per cent rise. Meanwhile Ryanair built on its recent run of record traffic, with passenger 
numbers up two per cent to 7.96m in June, despite disruption from strike action in France.

"Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who make great aircraft, and the 737-800 has been the foundation of Ryanair's 
recent successful growth due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability," said Michael O'Leary, president 
and CEO of Ryanair. "These 175 new airplanes will enable us to lower costs and airfares even further. They 
provide Ryanair with the additional capacity to exploit substantial growth opportunities that now exist as many of 
Europe's flag and regional airlines are restructuring and are reducing their short-haul operations." "We are delighted 
to finalize this order. It is a testament to the value the Next-Generation 737 family brings to Ryanair," said Ray 
Conner, Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO. "As the most efficient, reliable, large single-aisle 
airplane flying today, the Next-Generation 737 has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet.

Aer Lingus today announced it will open
routes to San Francisco and Toronto next
year in an effort to expand its
transatlantic services.
The expansion includes year-round direct service from Dublin to San Francisco as well as Toronto, which airline 
chiefs and government officials say will increase tourism traffic and increase Ireland's connectivity to the Silicon 
Valley. Both routes will commence in April 2014. "More than 40 percent of Ireland's total foreign investment comes 
from Silicon Valley alone. The return of the direct air service to the US west coast is particularly important," said Leo 
Varadkar TD, minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. 
With the routes, Aer Lingus' transatlantic capacity will grow by 24 percent in 2014, building off of the 13 percent 
growth in capacity achieved in 2013. "This expansion will directly support more than 200 jobs within Aer Lingus and 
our partner ASL Aviation Group," said Chief Executive Christoph Mueller. The year-round service from Dublin to 
Toronto is operated by one of three new Boeing 757 aircraft wet leased from ASL Aviation Group. The other two 
new Boeing 757 aircraft will be based in Shannon, where the airline plans to increase services to both Boston and 
New York, and commence year-round connections from Shannon to the east coast. Aer Lingus will offer five direct 
services per week from Dublin to San Francisco. Direct services to Toronto will be offered daily during the summer 
season and four times a week during the winter. Aer Lingus flew direct routes to San Francisco until 2009 when the 
economic downturn forced the airline to reduce its fleets. Airline chiefs and government officials believe 2013 will be 
a banner year for tourism, thanks in part to the 2013 Gathering. Varadkar expects to see more than 1 million 
American tourists visit Ireland this year. Aer Lingus currently has an operating margin of 5 percent, the highest

market is not ringing alarm bells in Renton, Washington, but Boeing is speeding up the 737 Max and hinting at a 
new round of performance improvements still to come.

Max aircraft by the end of the year, Boeing's half of the unofficial firm orders race at the Paris air show had a rough 
week. In fact, the 737 Max lost the duel with the A320neo by a four-to-one margin, lowering the former's market 
share in the head-to-head competition by a single percentage point to 39%.
IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL Boeing is confident that its less aggressive timeline and fuel-burn improvements 
for the 737 Max will even the score in its orders duel ....
Boeing executives greeted the walloping as it unfolded at Le Bourget with a shrug - not least because the US 
airframer does not endorse or even acknowledge air show-contrived orders races as part of its marketing strategy.
More broadly, Boeing points to the company's 20-year forecast showing a market for 24,000 aircraft in the 737 Max 
and A320neo category, and remains confident there is still plenty of time to achieve its goal of a rough orders parity 
by the end of the period.
"We, together, maybe have sold 10-15% of the market," says Scott Fancher, vice-president and general manager of 
airplane development for Boeing. "This game is just starting guys. [The 737 Max] is going to do just fine in the 
marketplace."
But Boeing is not leaving the matter entirely to time and fortune. In recent weeks, for example, the programme 
reviewed the planned entry into service of the 737 Max in the fourth quarter of 2017. That plan gave Boeing up to 
6.5 years to complete development, a timeline far less aggressive than the roughly 4.75-year allocation by Airbus to 
certificate the A320neo.
As the programme nears the firm configuration milestone in July, Boeing has decided to accelerate the entry into 
service of the 737 Max by up to six months.
"From Day 1, we anticipated the opportunity to accelerate the Max and built that opportunity into our planning," 
Fancher says. "When we hit certain milestones we assessed where we were at in the development and the risks 
going forward and determined the right thing to do was implement the acceleration we had pre-planned."
Fancher also emphasises that the faster schedule does not increase the odds of a delay in the programme because 
the potential acceleration was built into the schedule from the beginning. The new schedule allows Boeing to start 
delivering the 737 Max as soon as 1 July 2017, or almost six years from the programme's launch date.
At the same time, Boeing also wants customers to know the 737 Max could be even more fuel efficient than 
currently advertised.
Since early 2012, Boeing has claimed the 737 Max 8 will be 13% more efficient on a seat-cost basis than the 737-
800 on a 500nm (925km) segment. Replacing the CFM International CFM-56 with the more efficient Leap-1B 
accounts for all but 2% of that estimated improvement. Boeing also claims a 1% improvement from redesigning the 
tail cone, and another 1% from installing a double-bladed winglet.
It is the winglet itself that Boeing now thinks could save even more fuel than predicted, especially on longer 
distances. The 1% improvement is derived solely from estimated efficiency of the up/down configuration of the two 
blades. So far, Boeing has not counted any estimated fuel burn improvement from incorporating natural laminar 
flow techniques in the shaping and coatings of the entire winglet.
"What happens is we're going to make the winglet so smooth, it's going to be made out of a single piece with no 
seams," says Joe Ozimek, a former aerodynamicist and now Boeing's vice-president of product marketing. "It's 
going to be wrapped with a coating that makes it even more smooth. We know that we can get somewhere between 
three- and four-tenths of a percent for doing natural laminar flow on that winglet. It's additional benefit that we're not 
taking credit for."
Mastering natural laminar flow is critical for optimising aerodynamic efficiency. Each of the two blades on the 737 
Max winglet is an aerofoil. The air flow over the aerofoil remains laminar until it is "tripped" and transitions into 
turbulent flow. For aerodynamicists, the trick is to maintain laminar flow over the aerofoil for as long as possible, 
which usually involves making the surface as smooth and seamless as possible.
SPECIAL COATINGS
For the 737 Max, the design requires special coatings. Even coatings within paints used for the airline's logo on the 
winglet could cause the undesirable trip into turbulent airflow, Ozimek says.
IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL Boeing is confident that its less aggressive timeline and fuel-burn improvements 
for the 737 Max will even the score in its orders duel ....
"When you talk about laminar flow, flow is tripped easily. So if you improperly paint, if you decide you want to have 
your big logos out there painted on that thing, you get them far enough forward on the winglet you can actually 
affect how much improvement that would be," Ozimek says.
Ozimek dismissed questions about the possibility that small objects, including dead insects or bird droppings, would 
be enough to cause a transition on the winglets.
"An insect is not going to trip that flow, and if it did trip that flow it would trip it in one small area on a thing that's 
probably 8ft high," Ozimek says. "That's a good urban legend."
The 737 Max production system, meanwhile, is already gearing up to build the first aircraft in 2015. Boeing is 
already beginning to automate and upgrade the 737's ancestral factory, including an automated line to drill holes 
and fasten wing panels into stringers in vertical assembly tools. Amid the high-technology gadgetry, however, 
stands a relic of an era before computer-aided digital design software: a production mock-up.
MOCK-UP
The full-scale mock-up of the Section 41 nose section is made from production scraps and plywood, but it is 
accurate to within 0.32cm (0.13in). It was built because Section 41, which includes the cockpit, electronics bay and 
nose gear, will undergo the most changes in the transition to the 737 Max.
Many of the changes are because the CFM Leap-1B fan diameter is about 20.3cm wider, which means the nose 
landing gear was extended by the same in length. That means the wheel well inside the aft fuselage was moved 
forward by about 20.3cm.
The mock-up vividly reveals one of the impacts of the change in length of the nose gear inside the lower-deck 
electronics bay. The move shifted the maintenance access door forward. Boeing's digital design tools indicated the 
opening is now directly under the stabiliser drum. The drum cannot be relocated without a major revamp of the flight 
control system, with implications for the certification process. The mock-up allowed Boeing's designers to validate 
the access problem to the aft electronics bay in vivid three dimensions, and will help them understand how to deal 
with the issue.
"The story here around the Max is its on track," Fancher says. "That's why the airplane is gaining such momentum 
in the marketplace. We've got more work in front of us. We're approaching firm configuration of the airplane, which 
will occur very soon. From that point forward, it's about following through, getting the engineering complete, and 
getting the airplane to our customers."

RYANAIR, the low-cost Irish airline, said yesterday that Michael Cawley, joint deputy chief executive and chief 
commercial officer, is to step down in March 2014.
Cawley said he was leaving to pursue other business interests, but he has been asked by Ryanair chairman David 
Bonderman to join the board of airline as a non executive from May next year.
The airline said Cawley, who was in charge of the company's commercial strategy, general operations and its 
relationships with new routes and airports, would use the next 10 months to help with a smooth handover to his 
successor.
Cawley joined Ryanair as chief financial officer and commercial director in 1997, the same year that the firm made 
its stock market debut.
Before that, he was the group finance director of the Gowan Group - the main distributor for Peugeot and Citroen in 
Ireland - for four years.
Ryanair said it would name a replacement for Cawley - who holds the joint deputy CEO role alongside finance chief 
Howard Millar - in the coming months.
"I am grateful to Michael for his enormous contribution to the successful growth and development of Ryanair over 
the past 17 years," said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary.

LUFTHANSA, Europe's biggest airline, launched its re-branded budget carrier Germanwings yesterday in an 
attempt to cut costs and win back passengers from nofrills rivals.
Germanwings, which is taking over most of Lufthansa's short-haul flights in Europe, is seeking to reposition itself as 
a budget airline for business travelers offering extras such as champagne and more leg-room.
Lufthansa shut its short-haul business in January because it had been losing money, mainly due to competition 
from budget airlines EasyJet, Air Berlin and Ryanair.
The Germanwings revamp is a major part of Lufthansa's threeyear overhaul to boost group operating profit by 
(EURO)1.5bn to (EURO)2.3bn by 2015. Like other European airlines, Lufthansa has been hit by competition from 
lowcost rivals and Middle Eastern carriers.
Lufthansa, Europe's biggest airline by sales, is in the process of transferring 800 of its cabin crew and 30 planes to 
Germanwings, where costs are 20-30 per cent lower.
Germanwings aims to make a profit by 2015. In 2011, the last time it published results, its operating loss widened to 
(EURO)52m from (EURO)39m in 2010.

Analysis: Privatising Central and Eastern European carriers

Length: 1386 words
Highlight: Overwhelmed by losses state-owned carriers in Central and Eastern Europe cannot rely on government 
support to continue. Yana Palagacheva asks whether privatisations will allow them to survive and fend off 
competition from low-cost rivals.
Body
In February 2012 the Hungarian government finally gave up on attempts to save state-owned carrier Malev. The 
loss-making airline asked the government for help to continue operations stating that the situation was "unresolved 
from the end of January". However, the Hungarian government was not allowed to subsidize its flag carrier after the 
European Commission ruled that Malev must pay back illegal state aid, which it received between 2007 and 2010.
At 6am on the morning of February 3 the flag carrier shut down after 66 years of continuous operations. The next 
day low-cost carriers Wizz Air and Ryanair took over Malev's routes. Many other state-owned carriers in central and 
eastern Europe are struggling, and the risk to some of them after Malev's fate is growing.
Based on the most recent available financial results, nine-year -old Wizz Air posted a net profit of $54.5 million as of 
March 31 2012. This compares with an annual loss of $45.1 million reported in December 2011 for central Europe's 
biggest state-owned carrier, Lot Polish Airlines.
Most of the other state-owned carriers in the region are also loss-making. Lot is one vivid example of an airline in 
the region going through a lot of pressure. In May the European Commission temporarily approved a rescue loan of 
Zl400 million ($123.5 million) to Lot. The announcement came after previous reports that the carrier would not 
receive any further government support.
The loan aims to enable Lot to pay creditors and maintain operations while implementing its restructuring plan to 
avoid bankruptcy.  Separately there have been continuing talks to potential privatize Air Baltic, Jat Airways, Croatia 
Airlines and Adria Airways.
Finding the right buyer
In April Korean Air bought a 44% stake in troubled flag carrier Czech Airlines saving it, at least temporarily, from 
bankruptcy. The Czech government's intention to sustain the survival of the carrier was evident in the words of 
Miroslav Kalousek, the Czech Republic's minister of finance, who commenting on the acquisition said: "The entry of 
the Korean company represents a guarantee for the Czech Republic and its citizens that a significant Czech 
company with a 90-year-old tradition will not disappear."
Analysis: Privatising Central and Eastern European carriers
Despite governments being determined to save their national carriers, it is questionable how successful their efforts 
will be. Finding parties interested to invest in carriers with high cost structures is challenging, and there seems to be 
a fair risk that some of the state-owned airlines will be wiped away by the low-cost carriers.
Out of 50 big carriers approached by Czech Airlines, for example, only two submitted bids and one of them later 
withdrew. The partial privatization of the carrier was successful but, at the moment, Czech Airlines is the exception 
rather than the rule.
Between a rock and a hard place
Despite the economic growth in the region, national carriers in central and eastern Europe are still constrained by 
several factors, including their state-owned status, high cost structures and rigid union restrictions.
Another issue is size. Aside from Lot, the carriers in the region are too small to achieve genuine economies of 
scale.
In addition, the entry to the European Union has also created big challenges to these national carriers. EU law 
restricts the amount of government support an airline can receive and, at the same time, forces governments to 
open their aviation markets allowing other airlines to compete. Insiders agree that state-owned carriers in central 
and eastern Europe need transformation to their business models to survive. The difficult question is how this 
transformation is going to happen.
Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president, Avitas, believes that many of these airlines need privatization that limits 
government involvement.
"Realistically you have to privatize and do it in a smart way, but they want to have their cake and eat it too. They 
want to privatize those carriers but at the same time have the government run it. That's not going to happen," says 
Pilarski.
Governments' persistence in keeping involved in running those carriers is understandable because there is often 
not enough local money to privatize them, while giving the ownership away to a foreign carrier might endanger local 
interests.
There is no guarantee, for example, that the acquired carrier will not be relegated to a minor supportive role.
Pilarski notes: "On one hand, governments don't have the ability to constantly pour money into a losing business. 
On the other, they obviously don't want a big foreign player to take over the carrier and simply use it as a regional 
hub for their own traffic. The truth is they are between a rock and a hard place."
The state-owned model, however, does not necessarily prevent an airline from being successful. Emirates is one 
example of a state-owned airline which is very profitable because it embraces competition.
Chris Tarry, aviation consultant, Ctaira, notes that ownership should not matter as long as the carrier has the 
chance to apply its best practice.
The real issue comes when a national carrier is run as a government department, which limits market opportunities. 
That opens an issue about the strategic importance of a home airline.
"If you have your national carrier you will have better links to certain cities and this is what matters to the 
government," says Tarry. "Even the governments though will see no sense in sustaining the unsustainable."
Michael Duff, managing director, The Airline Analyst, is also sceptical of the survival of some of the airlines in the 
region.
"The reality of the competitive situation is that not every country needs a national carrier any more. I would imagine 
more state-owned airlines in the region ceasing operations," says Duff.
Analysis: Privatising Central and Eastern European carriers
"Some will go to a greater length to sustain the survival of a national carrier, but what is the incentive of investors to 
put money in if their cost structures make it very difficult for them to compete with the likes of Wizzair and Ryanair?" 
he adds.
Start-ups
The possibility of national carriers in the region going bust creates an opportunity for start-ups with better business 
models in the region. The strength of Wizz Air, which started operations only nine years ago, is one example of the 
success of the low-cost model in the region.
The LCCs are likely to gain even bigger popularity in eastern Europe because passengers tend to compromise on 
service rather than on price.
"I think that there will be more start-ups, some of them will be low-cost, and some will be successful," says Pilarski.
The biggest challenge to the potential start-ups is the existing low-cost carriers. Wizz Air, Ryanair and easyJet 
already have a strong presence in the region, and they keep on growing their route network. This might not leave 
many potential business opportunities up for grabs for a start-up airline. Non-low-cost carriers, which are already 
well recognized, have also expressed interest in the region. Aeroflot, for example, has made it clear that it plans to 
expand into eastern Europe.
The major factors for an airline's success are the brand, market reach, revenue and cost management. All those 
criteria might be difficult for a start-up in the region to achieve, according to Tarry.
"As soon as potential start-ups develop their market Ryanair or easyJet will come in and see this as a business 
opportunity. The difficulty for airlines starting up is how they defend their market," says Tarry.
The government's job is to ensure not only safety but also a competitive market. Historically, it has been very 
difficult to compete against state owned enterprises in the region.
Governments may be tempted to protect their flag carriers by creating hurdles for potential start-ups. One way of 
doing that is delaying or denying regulatory approvals.
However, the Malev case should serve as a stark warning to many of these governments. Ultimately, the fate of 
these national carriers will depend on how successfully they can be privatized. Lot should be a good test case. If 
the Polish government can privatize it, and resist the temptation to exert its influence on its new owners, then the 
airline has some hope of recovery. But if the government cannot step away, it can only spell more trouble for an 
already troubled airline.

Dublin is to get 90 new jobs over the next two years as four new companies announced they would open offices in 
Ireland.
The new companies, which IDA Ireland has identified as fast-growth firms, cover everything from digital marketing 
and software to games.
Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said the announcement was great news for Ireland.

EVERYBODY, including individuals, pressure groups, consumer lobbies, taxpayers, companies, even banks, 
should have the right to make their case to elected officials if they don't like a proposed new law. That's democracy. 
The idea that they shouldn't is an affront to free speech. But I don't understand why UK companies think their efforts 
should inevitably take place behind closed doors, with expensive lobbyists involved, and why they so rarely wish to 
conduct a public discussion or influence voters' opinions on the big issues.
UK Plc's obsession with negotiating in private is bad for its own reputation, as well as short-sighted, ineffective and 
ultimately detrimental to shareholders and the national interest.
Privately, firms and their bosses will express their worries, often cogently; but they will never go on the record. They 
never want to be quoted.
The result is that when a big story breaks - such as the EU's cap on bonuses, which will make the City less flexible - 
no CEO or senior director ever wants to speak out. Companies prefer to stay silent. It is usually left to groups such 
as the British Bankers' Association or the CBI to do the heavy lifting, and they do a good job. But the message 
would often be far more powerful and effective if it were to come from actual business leaders and companies, 
rather than their surrogates.
And almost unbelievably, it has been known - after an especially serious attack on an industry - for even the 
representative body to refuse to go on the record.
In some cases, one ends up in a situation where only think-tankers or journalists can be called upon to express 
their views. Of course, the companies in question say they are worried about how the media will treat them - but 
British business needs to start talking to the public once more EDITOR'S LETTER
how exactly do they think their cause will be depicted if they refuse to defend themselves or put their side of the 
story? No wonder banking and other industries are so disliked. Once again, business is proving to be its own worst 
enemy, and betraying the interests of staff and investors.
There is just one exception to this sorry, cowardly state of affairs, and that is airline bosses. They are always 
delighted to speak out: Willie Walsh has been campaigning vigorously for an extension to Heathrow, for example, 
slamming the government's position on this matter, Sir Richard Branson is often happy to express his views, and 
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is as outspoken as it gets. Not for them excessive deference or caution. As a result of 
their ability to interact directly with the public, through the media or even advertising campaigns, these chiefs have 
often succeeded in getting their message across.
It's in that light that I look upon King's onslaught on banks, one of his parting shots before he retires. He complained 
that banks were trying to lobby George Osborne to get rules changed, and that they in turn had put pressure on the 
Bank of England's prudential regulation authority. At issue was whether the lobbying was too extreme, King's 
contention, or whether it was just a case of banks exercising their democratic rights, and a sympathetic government 
choosing to relay the message. Part of the argument, of course, is that the government cannot set up an 
independent regulator and then tell it what to do; if it wants to retain that power, it should change the rules.
But the real problem is somewhat different. If the banks believe that being forced to hold more capital will reduce 
the loans they can make, why don't they say so at every opportunity? Why don't CEOs actually make that case and 
try to sell it directly to the public? Why don't they give on the record interviews, or pitch cogent, hard-hitting op-eds 
(rather than the endless, dreary nonsense they sometimes try and get published)? For its own sake, business 
needs to engage the public much more directly.

O'Leary reverses air show boycott with Paris debut

The Ryanair chief pours scorn on rivals and rule makers... oh, and announces a $3 billion 737-800 order with 
Boeing
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary broke a personal boycott on air show attendance to confirm a $3 billion 
order - at list prices - for 175 Boeing 737-800s.
And the orders from the Irish low-cost carrier could keep mounting for Boeing as O'Leary revealed a Ryanair team 
is evaluating an order for at least 200 737 Max aircraft that could come by year-end. "It's a great pleasure to be 
here," said O'Leary, breaking his self-imposed, 25-year silence at industry trade shows.
No-one appreciated the feisty Irish CEO's debut appearance at Le Bourget more than Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner, who described O'Leary's presence as "a tremendous statement".
The contract signing completes a five-year saga of contract negotiations in which the Ryanair boss flirted with offers 
from the Airbus A320neo and the Comac C919.
In the end, Ryanair still prefers the 737-800 because it holds nine more seats than the A320neo in a single-class 
lay-out, O'Leary says.
When Conner added that the 737 also is more fuel efficient, O'Leary interjected: "I actually disagree with that." The 
737 and A320 come out about even on overall fuel efficiency, he says, but the 737-800 and 737 Max 8 are more 
fuel efficient per seat.
In fact, O'Leary wants Boeing to install still nine more seats in the Max 8, raising the total number 199 or 200.
Conner responds that he still intends to introduce the 737 Max 8 in the third quarter of 2017 with the same number 
of seats as the 737-800.
O'Leary laid into his favourite targets at Paris: rival airlines and environmentalists. But he saved his strongest 
comments for EU rule makers. With the Emissions Trading System, "the Europeans have demonstrated, once 
O'Leary reverses air show boycott with Paris debut
again, their inability to think in a straight line," he says. "The Americans and Chinese and all the other sensible 
economies have told them to 'piss off, this is nuts, we're not paying'."

Boeing barely moves needle on Max PARIS: Boeing barely moves needle on 
737 Max; Re-engined update to the type secures only one firm order, leaving 
it trailing behind the A320neo by more than 800 aircraft

After dominating Farnborough last year, the 737 Max programme picked up only one new firm order in Paris despite 
a newly accelerated schedule for development and entry into service.
The re-engined and updated single aisle was mostly overshadowed in the flood of order announcements and 
product launches during the air show by Boeing's widebody programmes.
But the 737 Max left the show after signing a new firm order by CIT Leasing for 30 aircraft, almost matching the 
Airbus A320neo pick-up of one new firm order by International Lease Finance for 50 aircraft. Meanwhile, Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O'Leary offered the 737 Max a lift by stating his intention to buy at least 200 of the model by 
the end of the year.
The dearth of new orders means that Boeing failed to move the needle in the orders race with the A320neo, which 
is ahead by more than 800 aircraft nearly two years after Boeing launched the 737 Max family.
Boeing, however, made a show of confidence in the 737 Max development schedule. The company announced that 
the first delivery of the 737 Max 8 will occur in the third quarter of 2017, or as much as six months faster than the 
original schedule.
Boeing vice-president of airplane development Scott Fancher says the first delivery was moved up from late in the 
fourth quarter of 2017 to early in the third quarter, as the airframer has become more confident of the design and 
production system.
The acceleration means the transition from the next-generation 737 to the CFM International Leap-1B-powered 737 
Max will come sooner, perhaps reducing the number of orders for the older type that Boeing needs to fill the gap.
Boeing barely moves needle on Max PARIS: Boeing barely moves needle on 737 Max Re-engined update to 
the type secures only one firm order, leaving it trailing be....
The 737 Max now will enter the market about two years after the scheduled service debut of the similarly re-
engined A320neo, which was launched about nine months before the Boeing product.
Boeing, however, plans more extensive changes for the 737 Max, including a new advanced technology winglet, re-
lofted tail cone, 787-style flight displays and an electronic bleed air system. The larger diameter Leap-1B, 
meanwhile, means Boeing also must increase the height of the landing gear by 20cm (8in), which drove a re-design 
of the forward electronics equipment bay in the nose section that encloses the nose gear.

More than 1,000 commitments were announced by the manufacturers at the show, with 666 of them firm orders
Airbus managed to revive A380 sales during the Paris air show as Ireland-based asset management company 
Doric Lease tentatively signed for 20 of the double-deck type.
Its agreement, once firmed, will bring to 282 the number of A380s ordered and give a lift to a programme which had 
not logged a sale in six months, since Singapore Airlines signed for five last December.
Doric is intending to take delivery of the aircraft from 2016 and make an engine selection later this year.
Chief Mark Lapidus believes the lessor can "explain" the aircraft to potential operators and help them to "cross the 
line" into A380 operations. Doric already has experience with the A380, having 18 of the type under management.
"The economics of this aircraft are currently unbeatable," says Lapidus. "If anything, we're probably under-
ordering."
Although the Doric deal has yet to be finalised, Airbus secured firm orders for 241 aircraft during the Paris air show, 
including 170 A320-family twinjets and 71 long-haul airframes. It values these orders at $39 billion.
It landed a new order for 10 A350-1000s from United Airlines - which also converted 25 previous A350-900s to the 
larger variant - and firmed previous commitments from Air France-KLM and Singapore Airlines for 55 A350-900s. 
SriLankan Airlines' order for six A330s completed the widebody total.
Orders in the single-aisle sector comprised 70 A320neos and 30 A320s for Lufthansa, firming a previously 
disclosed commitment, and 50 more A320neos for International Lease Finance. US budget carrier Spirit Airlines 
ordered 20 A321s.

Alongside the firm orders for 50 baseline A320s at the show, Airbus obtained commitments from EasyJet for 35 - 
part of a broader pact which will also includes 100 A320neos.
High-profile commitments from British Airways, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines, together with lessors Air 
Lease and GECAS, to formally launch the Boeing 787-10 led the way for the US aircraft manufacturer at the show. 
It secured 102 commitments for the 787 variant.
Like Airbus, its order book was swelled during the show by confirmation of Ryanair's commitment for 175 Boeing 
737-800s. It also secured a 30-strong order from lessor CIT Aerospace for 737 Max 8s, as well follow-up orders 
from Korean Air for 747-8 Intercontinentals and 777-300ERs.
Embraer's 365 commitments for its new E-Jet E2, including a mix of firm orders and options from US regional 
SkyWest and lessor ILFC, dominated the regional aircraft picture, though ATR also recorded one of its busiest 
shows with 52 firm orders for its turboprops including deals with lessors Nordic Aviation Capital and HGI Capital.
Overall there were more than 1,000 order commitments announced during this year's Paris air show, 666 of which 
were firm orders. This number though includes several high-profile orders which confirmed previously announced 
tentative deals.

To appear in Best of the Brokers, email your research to notes@cityam.com ASHTEAD Numis Securities increases 
its target price to 640p from 582p but cuts the equipment rental group to "hold" from "add". The firm's pre-tax profit 
last week came in £12m above the broker's forecasts at £247m. But Numis is concerned that a cyclical recovery 
could lead to a decline in capital returns.
RYANAIR RBC upgrades its target price for the airline to (EURO)8.75 from (EURO)8.00 and reiterates its 
"outperform" rating following the £10bn deal last week for 175 new Boeing planes. The broker said Ryanair has 
increased medium term growth potential, driven in part by relatively low operating costs.
PARAGON Espirito Santo maintains its "buy" recommendation for the specialist lender and raises its target price to 
393p from 344p. The broker increases its growth forecast for buy-to-let mortgage origination for the next two years 
as the market recovers and the firm adds warehouse space.

Cantor Fitzgerald looks at Ryanair today and changes its status from hold to buy:
It is understandable looking at RYA's share price performance to be a bit sceptical of the
BUY case. But growth prospects are strong, driven by new routes and higher yields. Costs look contained with 
medium-term fleet, staff and airport deals in place. RYA also guided E1bn of additional buy-backs and special 
dividends at its Investor Day last week. Even with large cash outflows for these returns and new fleet, its balance 
sheet should remain the strongest in the sector. Its valuation is also not high versus historic metrics; trading on 
CY14e PE of 14.3x vs. an average of 16x. We lift our FY14-15 forecasts by 7pc with higher passenger growth and 
yields offsetting increased costs. But our assumed margins are still low versus historic trends. We are also more 
positive on medium-term growth prospects and we lift our TP to E9 (from E6). Our forecasts are lifted and we

EU changes could see Ryanair 's Aer Lingus stake heavily scrutinised

Ryanair could face far greater scrutiny of its minority stake in Aer Lingus if the European Commission pushes 
through changes to merger regulations it is considering.
A consultation paper just published by the Commission raises the possibility of applying merger rules to companies 
that acquire non-controlling minority shareholdings in rivals. Currently, the Commission only has the right to become 
involved in cases where a transaction by a company will lead to an acquisition or control over another company.
The paper discusses a number of options of how "an effective control could be achieved without creating an undue 
burden for businesses," said a statement from the Commission.
"Non-controlling minority stakes of one firm in another are a widespread phenomenon in many industries. 
Experience shows that, in some specific instances, the acquisition of a non-controlling minority stake can harm 
competition and consumers. For example, if in a concentrated market one firm acquires a 20 per cent stake in a 
competitor, it may influence the latter's competitive conduct even without gaining control," it said.
Ryanair currently owns 29.8 per cent of Aer Lingus. It has been an outspoken critic of the direction in which Aer 
Lingus's management team is taking the airline.
Ryanair has also been deeply critical of the Commission's handling of its takeover bid for Aer Lingus, which the 
European authorities again rejected last February.

Flybe dives deeper into red as passenger numbers fall TRAVEL & LEISURE
Flybe dives deeper into red as passenger numbers fall; TRAVEL & LEISURE

Body
The chief executive of Flybe has insisted that the struggling UK carrier was on track to "reclaim its position as 
Europe's leading regional airline", in spite of reporting a near sevenfold increase in its annual pre-tax losses.
The Exeter-based airline yesterday blamed restructuring charges and higher staff and fuel costs for its full-year pre-
tax loss of £40.7m, compared with a loss of £6.2m last year.
Flybe's UK division reported a £32.5m loss, exacerbated by a 1.1 per cent year-on-year fall in passenger numbers 
to 7.2m as cash-strapped customers used cheaper travel alternatives.
The regional carrier's UK division lost about £4.50 for every seat flown, while its load factor - an industry measure of 
how well carriers fills their aircraft - edged up 1 percentage point to 64.1, still well below the 85-plus regularly 
recorded by Ryanair and easyJet .
"Our results for 2012-13, while expected, are nonetheless disappointing," said Jim French, chairman and chief 
executive, adding that the next 18 months would be vital in implementing the turnround plan.
Flybe would look to grow by increasing its contract flying operations, and identified its operations from Southampton 
airport as "a key part of its future", Mr French said.
In January, Flybe initiated a restructuring that included the axing of 300 staff - including one-fifth of its UK-based 
management - and the outsourcing of support services such as on-board catering and aircraft maintenance.
Mr French said that this restructuring would deliver £40m in savings in the current financial year to March 31, which 
were expected to rise to £50m the following year. Other remedial actions have included the sale of takeover slots at 
Gatwick airport to easyJet for £20m and the deferment of a delivery of 16 Embraer E-series regional jets.
"The recent sale of Gatwick slots and the announced deferral of new aircraft orders should provide the group with 
some cash to fund its restructuring programme, but we think it unlikely that the shares will re-rate until management 
can provide some tangible evidence of the turnround," said Edward Stanford, analyst at Oriel Securities.

The airline booked £12.8m in restructuring costs during the year - at the upper end of its estimate.
The shares rose 0.6 per cent to close at 41.5p.

Body
A four-day slump in the ISEQ index prompted a flurry of bargain-hunting buys this morning with the index gaining 
over 60 points.
The ISEQ rose 62.34 points to 3,952.80.
European shares rose today, led by food and beverages as investors cautiously bought defensive sectors after the 
previous session's market rout on the prospect of reduced stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The 
FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.8 percent at 1,153.08, having slid 3.1 percent on Thursday suffering its biggest one-day 
fall in 19 months.
Overnight, European finance ministers have agreed that the ESM can directly recapitalize failing banks up to a limit 
of E60bn and with retrospective capitalization on a case-by-case basis. This raises the possibility that Ireland could 
divest its remaining stakes in the banking system to the ESM - helping to push down gross government debt. 
Ryanair's investor day in London yesterday highlighted the airline's managed growth potential. Its circa 50pc ex-fuel 
cost advantage relative to its competitors and the demand from airports for growth allow it to step up its growth 
plans (from FY2016), increasing target passenger numbers to 110m (from 100m) by FY2019. At the same time, 
detailed plans to return at least E1bn to shareholders illustrate the cash generative ability of the model in what is, in 
effect, an average 5pc yield per annum over the next two years. Allocating a higher weighting of our valuation 
methodology to cash flow metrics allows us to raise our price target to E8 (from E7.5). Ryanair shares jumped 28c 
to E7.33. Davy Stockbrokers say that any increase in recycled containerboard prices would have a significant 
impact on the 2014 earnings forecasts for all of the players in the sector. "Smurfit Kappa Group, at 4.8 times our 
2013 forecast, is still by far the cheapest name in the sector. Positive earnings momentum combined with the 
potential for re-rating supports our view that a 1400c price target is readily achievable by the end of this year," the 
broker said. Shares in SKG rose 16c to E12.10.

A strong rebound on the ISEQ index went in to reverse this afternoon after a global sell off prompted by US Fed 
stimulus cuts.
At the close, the index was down 6.45 points to 3,884.01.
European shares tumbled today in strong volumes, hitting near six-month lows, as concerns about the prospect of

cost advantage relative to its competitors and the demand from airports for growth allow it to step up its growth 
plans (from FY2016), increasing target passenger numbers to 110m (from 100m) by FY2019. At the same time, 
detailed plans to return at least E1bn to shareholders illustrate the cash generative ability of the model in what is, in 
effect, an average 5pc yield per annum over the next two years. Allocating a higher weighting of our valuation 
methodology to cash flow metrics allows us to raise our price target to E8 (from E7.5). Ryanair shares jumped 15c 
to E7.20. Davy Stockbrokers say that any increase in recycled containerboard prices would have a significant 
impact on the 2014 earnings forecasts for all of the players in the sector. "Smurfit Kappa Group, at 4.8 times our 
2013 forecast, is still by far the cheapest name in the sector. Positive earnings momentum combined with the 
potential for re-rating supports our view that a 1400c price target is readily achievable by the end of this year," the 
broker said. Shares in SKG rose 6c to E12.00.

A strong rebound on the ISEQ index went in to reverse this afternoon after a global sell off prompted by US Fed 
stimulus cuts.
At the close, the index was down 6.45 points to 3,884.01.
European shares tumbled today in strong volumes, hitting near six-month lows, as concerns about the prospect of 
reduced U.S. monetary stimulus continued to rock financial markets worldwide. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares provisionally ended 0.7 percent lower at 1,136.38 points, a level not seen since early January. 
Trading volume was brisk, boosted by the expiry of monthly and quarterly options and futures, which exacerbated 
volatility during the session. "We're at a turning point, and it has come earlier than what investors had expected. 
Liquidity has now become the major focus for markets," said Roland Kaloyan, global asset allocation strategist, at 
Societe Generale CIB.

A spokesman for the Minister for Transport said yesterday that the State will look to be a more active shareholder 
now that
it has decided not to sell its stake in the short term. This could include the State looking to secure new routes which 
will
benefit trade and tourism and the payment of an annual dividend. The spokesman also added that the State would 
not sell
its stake until the UK authorities have reached a firm decision on Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus.
In the short term, these comments will probably have minimal influence given that Aer Lingus is in the process of 
adding new routes. It has also already paid a dividend and would like to follow a progressive policy. Longer term, 
the State's influence may be less welcome if, for example, Aer Lingus wants to scale back some unprofitable routes 
according to a report this morning from Investec. The additional comments on the timing of a potential disposal are 
not surprising and make sound sense, in our view. While the UK's OFT is likely to require Ryanair to at least sell 
down some of its 29pc stake and possibly dispose its entire stake, we expect that Ryanair will appeal any ruling and 
that a final resolution could take some time to be put in place, Investec reports.

RYANAIR plans to return (EURO)1bn (£646m) to its investors by 2015 and increase its passenger numbers to 
110m a year over the next five years, the budget airline told investors yesterday.
The Irish firm will complete at least (EURO)400m of share buybacks in the current financial year and pay the 
remaining (EURO)600m in either further buybacks or by issuing a special dividend, which would be the company's 
third since 2010.
Ryanair has returned (EURO)1.5bn to shareholders since 2008, including a (EURO)492m special dividend during 
its last financial year.
The airline said it hopes to increase passenger numbers by seven per cent a year, up from its previous target of five 
per cent, and carry 110m passengers a year by 2019, up from a previous target of 100m.
Ryanair carried 79.6m passengers in the year to March 2013, making it the world's biggest international airline by 
traffic numbers.
Michael O'Leary's company this week finalised an order for 175 Boeing 737-800 planes, for delivery between 2014 
and 2019.
The chief executive hinted at Paris Air Show that Ryanair could launch a long-haul service, providing it could get 
enough planes and landing slots.
O'Leary has made no secret of his transatlantic ambitions, but has long maintained that the service would be run as 
a separate company.
Ryanair reveals (EURO)1bn windfall for its investors
Ryanair's announcements came after rival low-cost carrier EasyJet unveiled a £7bn plane order with Airbus, a third 
of which will be used to increase services.

Snippets of merger talk provided slight relief from the heavy selling seen across all markets and all sectors.
Elan Corporation , the Irish drugmaker that last week put itself up for sale to fend off a hostile bid from Royalty 
Pharma, climbed 4.2 per cent to EUR10.53 on talk that US rival Forest Laboratories was among those that had 
expressed an interest.
Royalty dropped its $8bn hostile bid for Elan on Tuesday but has said it remains interested in taking part in the sale 
process.
Nokia has also been the subject of speculation, and yesterday it was reported the Finnish mobile handset maker 
and networks operator was in talks to sell its mobile unit to Microsoft, with whom it already shares a partnership.
The shares were up 5.1 per cent to EUR3 after also advancing in the previous session on rumours of bid interest 
from China's Huawei.
Ryanair was also one of the few gainers after it announced plans to return up to EUR1bn to shareholders through 
buybacks and dividends. Its shares climbed 1.2 per cent to EUR7.06.
But the overwhelming weight was towards the downside, with financials and carmakers among the biggest losers. 
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 3.1 per cent to 1,143.99.
Among the biggest fallers on the pan-European index was French carmaker Renault, down 6.8 per cent to 
EUR53.49.
The sector, which bore the heaviest losses of all the Eurofirst's industry groups, saw Germany's Volkswagen fall 
3.9 per cent to EUR147.60 and Italy's Fiat lose 4.8 per cent to EUR5.28.
Richemont and Swatch were prominent losers after data showed Swiss watch exports were down 3.9 per cent in 
May, largely due to weakness in China.
Elan boosted by talk of new bid EUROPE
Shares in Richemont, owner of the Cartier and Piaget brands, fell 5.2 per cent to SFr80.70, while Swatch lost 5.2 
per cent to SFr506.50.
Turkey's BITS 100 was the worst performing of the region's domestic indices, losing 6.8 per cent to 73,461.89 on 
fears that investors will withdraw funds from riskier emerging markets.
