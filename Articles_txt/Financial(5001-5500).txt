 A man with cerebral palsy says he was 'unceremoniously booted' from a Ryanair flight because his wheelchair was 
too 'heavy' to lift off a conveyor belt and into the plane. 
Brandon Aughton, 24, was due to fly with his carer to Malaga, Spain from East Midlands Airport for his first holiday 
after two years shielding, before an apparent mix up between the flight operator and the cargo handling company 
meant he was removed.

Nov 08, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has launched a seat sale aimed at boosting its winter travel. 
The airline is offering 80,000 seats for a sale of 9.99 each in more than 530 routes across Europe for travel this 
November and December. In order to avail this offer, customers need to book their flights before midnight on Nov 
14. Some of the top destinations the carrier's Irish customers can choose from include Faro, Portugal; and 
Lanzarote, Malaga and Tenerife in Spain. 
Given the continued improvement in traffic, the low fares are expected to further boost demand. Evidently, the 
airline's October traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 11.3 million as air-travel demand continues to 
recover in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the period was 84% 
compared with 73% in October 2020. The European carrier's traffic has been rising steadily over the past few 
months. In September, traffic was 10.6 million compared with 5.2 million in the year-ago period. In August, traffic 
increased to 11.1 million from 7 million in the comparable period in 2020. The same rose to 9.3 million in July from 
4.4 
million 
in 
the 
year-ago 
period.

IAG banks on revival in transatlantic travellers
IAG banks on revival in transatlantic travellers

Body
British Airways owner IAG is banking on the reopening of transatlantic travel to revive its business after warning it 
will lose (EURO)3bn this year.
The group, which also owns airlines including Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, has suffered huge losses over the 
past 18 months after being shut out of its most lucrative north Atlantic market, which has in effect been closed since 
early 2020.
But Luis Gallego, IAG's chief executive, said Monday's reopening of the US border to foreign nationals would be "a 
pivotal moment for our industry".
IAG's airlines plan to increase their flight schedules to 60 per cent of normal levels this quarter in response, up from 
the 40 per cent flown over the summer, which are typically the industry's busiest months.
Looking further ahead, Gallego expected capacity on the north Atlantic routes to reach 90 per cent of prepandemic 
levels by next summer.
Gallego said long-haul bookings had recovered more quickly than short haul and reported "early signs of a recovery 
in business travel".

Analysts said that unlike low-cost rivals Ryanair and Wizz Air, which both returned to profit over the summer with 
flights across Europe, IAG would not be able to recover until its huge network of long-haul operations was running 
again.
IAG's recovery this year has also lagged behind fellow flag carriers Lufthansa, which reported a small profit in the 
third quarter, and Air France, which guided to positive fullyear earnings.
Unlike those two continental carriers, IAG was not offered a government bailout during the crisis, although it has 
received state-backed loans through BA. IAG instead tapped the debt and equity markets to build a firewall of cash 
to see it through the crisis. The group had access to (EURO)10.6bn of liquidity by the end of September.
As a consequence, IAG, like much of the airline industry, has a huge debt burden to service. It reported 
(EURO)12.4bn in net debt by the end of September, up from (EURO)7.5bn at the end of 2019.
It forecasts a loss of about (EURO)3bn for the full year, which is slightly worse than analysts had forecast but an 
improvement on the (EURO)4.3bn lost last year.

British Airways owner IAG is banking on the reopening of transatlantic travel to revive its business after warning it 
will lose (EURO)3bn this year.
The group, which also owns airlines including Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, has suffered huge losses over the 
past 18 months after being shut out of its most lucrative north Atlantic market, which has in effect been closed since 
early 2020.
But Luis Gallego, IAG's chief executive, said Monday's reopening of the US border to foreign nationals would be "a 
pivotal moment for our industry".
IAG's airlines plan to increase their flight schedules to 60 per cent of normal levels this quarter in response, up from 
the 40 per cent flown over the summer, which are typically the industry's busiest months.
Looking further ahead, Gallego expected capacity on the north Atlantic routes to reach 90 per cent of prepandemic 
levels by next summer.
Gallego said long-haul bookings had recovered more quickly than short haul and reported "early signs of a recovery 
in business travel".

first-class cabins while corporate travel has been quiet. Gallego said this strategy had worked well.

reported (EURO)12.4bn in net debt by the end of September, up from (EURO)7.5bn at the end of 2019.
The airline group saw positive operating cash flow for the first time since the start of the pandemic in the third 
quarter, but still reported a (EURO)485m operating loss before exceptional items, compared with the (EURO)1.3bn 
lost the previous year.
The group forecasts a loss of approximately (EURO)3bn for the full year, which is slightly worse than analysts had 
forecast but an improvement on the (EURO)4.3bn lost last year.

The post-pandemic return to profitability is a long haul for IAG. While low-cost carrier Ryanair rang up profits in the 
third quarter, BA's owner posted an operating loss of (EURO)485mand is guiding for (EURO)3bn for the full year.
IAG's portfolio of incumbent airlines aremore skewed to long haul and business travellers. As borders creak open-in 
Australia, Thailand and the US, where foreign nationals can travel freely fromMonday-at least some of that business 
will return. That trend is already in evidence, with booking levels to and fromNorth America almost back at pre-
Covid levels. Across all routes, passenger capacity doubled quarter on quarter to 43 per cent of 2019 levels and is 
expected to reach 60 per cent in the current quarter.
Financially, it is in stronger shape, with (EURO)10.6bn of liquidity-up from (EURO)8.1bn at end-December and a far 
cry fromSeptember 2020 when it was forced into launching a deeply discounted (EURO)2.75bn rights issue.
Assuming bookings continue to return, UBS sees debt levels starting to whittle back fromthe second half of next 
year.
Still, it is the industry's quiddity that it just cannot catch a break. passengers are returning but so too are inflated oil 
costs. IAG's average fuel prices for the first ninemonths of the year were up 40 per cent, admittedly fromthe Covid-
hit year-ago figure. R ¦ ising interest rates bode ill for a company with net debt of (EURO)12.4bn, although much of 
that is currently fixed.
IAG's performance lags behind its peers, partly a reflection of its exposure to the UK and US, which both had heavy 
travel curbs amid the pandemic. Over the past year its negative ebitda margins are roughly four times those of Air 
France-KLMand Lufthansa.
IAG: borders open
On an EV/forward ebitda basis shares trade above European peers. Unfazed, investors ended the morning session 
pushing the price higher. That leaves a lot riding on full seats as grounded planes return to the skies.

Ryanair is preparing to bring to an end its 20-year listing on the London Stock Exchange to comply with EU rules 
following Brexit, as it announced it had swung back to profit for the first time since 2019.
The Irish airline said on Monday it has begun a review into whether to give up its
London quote, which is a secondary listing, to focus on its primary market of Dublin.
"I think it is an inevitability post-Brexit," chief executive Michael O'Leary said. "In my personal view, I think we will 
probably delist some time in the next six months." Philip Georgiadis and Philip Stafford

The winter flight schedule for the 2021/22 season will take effect on 31 October 2021. In addition to new 
destinations and frequency increases, several airlines are also offering flight services on routes which were 
temporarily suspended in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Austrian Airlines is launching flights to Cancún in 
Mexico and thus offers three sunny long-haul destinations to escape from the chilly weather, namely Malé on the 
Maldives and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean alongside Cancún. Wizz Air and Ryanair are expanding their route 
network from Vienna by adding a total of thirteen destinations. Aegean, Air Cairo, Corendon Airlines, Jet2.com, 
Pegasus Airlines, Sunexpress, Transavia France and Volotea are once again operating flights to and from Vienna. 
The destinations of Toronto with Air Canada, Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines, Abu Dhabi with Etihad and 
Jeddah with SAUDIA will once again be accessible from Vienna starting with the new winter flight schedule. 
Accordingly, by offering flight service to 150 destinations in the winter 2021/22 flight schedule, Vienna Airport is 
already close to 90% of the pre-crisis offering of 172 destinations in 2019.
"The winter flight schedule makes us cautiously optimistic that the offering of flight destinations from Vienna is 
growing again. This coming winter about 90% of the travel destinations which were offered from Vienna Airport 
before the coronavirus crisis can once again be reached via direct flights. Moreover, new destinations are also 
represented, including Cancún, Abu Dhabi, Akaba, Banja Luka and Lappeenranta in Finland. The planning and 
announcements made by the airline also give us hope for 2022. We expect a significant recovery of passenger 
volumes when the next summer flight schedule comes into effect in the spring of 2022," states Julian Jäger, 
Member of the Management Board of Flughafen Wien AG.
Destination offering recovers and is close to the pre-crisis level
At present direct flight service is available from Vienna to 150 destinations, so that Vienna Airport has now reached 
close to 90% of the pre-crisis level. In comparison, 172 destinations were included in the 2019/20 winter flight 
schedule. On balance, with the addition of Cancún in Mexico, a total of seven transatlantic destinations are now 
being served from Vienna, along with 125 European destinations, comprised of 84 destinations in Western Europe 
and 41 in Eastern Europe. This development underlines the important flight hub function of Vienna Airport in the 
heart of Europe.
Winter 2021/22 flight schedule: new destinations and frequency increases at Vienna Airport - destination 
offering close to 90% of the pre-crisis level in 2019
Austrian Airlines resumes flight service to Cancún for the first time since 2006
Three popular long-haul destinations can be reached from Vienna Airport with Austria's home carrier starting at the 
end of October 2021. After a break of fifteen years, Austrian Airlines is offering flight service again to Cancún in 
Mexico, along with Malè on the Maldives and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, similar to last winter. The long-haul 
flight connections to Montreal in Canada as well as Chicago, New York and Washington in the USA are available to 
passengers all year long.
Wizz Air resumes flight service to numerous destinations along with four new ones
Flights from Vienna to Marrakech (MA), Amman (JO), Akaba (JO) and Sharm El Sheikh (EG) will be offered by 
Wizz Air for the first time starting after the turn of the new year. In addition, the airline will once again serve 
Eindhoven (NL), Kharkov (UA), Kutaisi (GE) and Las Palmas (ES) in its winter flight schedule. Existing frequencies 
to Tel Aviv (IL), Cologne (DE), Bari (IT), Tenerife (ES), Tuzla (BA) and Varna (BG) will be increased.
Ryanair serves nine new destinations and increases frequencies
The destinations of Marseille (FR), Danzig (PL), Agadir (MA), Lappeenranta (FI), Pisa (IT), Banja Luka (BA), Kosice 
(SK), Zaragoza (ES) and Amman (JO) have been added to Ryan Air's flight offering from Vienna in the winter flight 
schedule. Frequencies to Stockholm (SE), Brussels (BE), Bologna and Naples (IT), Kyiv (UA), Riga (LV), Tenerife 
(ES) and Billund (DK) will be raised by Ryanair.
Many airlines are returning to Vienna with flight connections
Starting in October, Air Serbia will operate flights to Kraljevo (RS) once again, and Transavia France will fly to 
Paris-Orly (FR), whereas Volotea is resuming flight service to Nantes (FR) in November and Jet2.com will offer 
several Christmas flights from Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and Leeds/Bradford (GB) to Vienna. Moreover, 
during the course of the winter season Pegasus Airlines will also operate flights to Ankara (TR) and Rossiya to St. 
Petersburg (RU) on behalf of Aeroflot. Air Cairo will offer flight service to Hurghada (EG), and Corendon Airlines will 
serve Hurghada (EG), Izmir and Antalya (TR). Sunexpress will also raise existing frequencies to Antalya (TR), 
whereas British Airways and Air France will increase the number of flight connections to London-Heathrow (GB) 
and Paris-CDG (FR) to up to three daily flights.
Air Canada, Ethiopian Airlines, Etihad and SAUDIA also included in the winter season
Etihad Airways has been operating flights from Vienna Airport since the summer of 2021, serving the Abu Dhabi 
(AE) - Vienna route, also in the winter months. Air Canada will offer flights once again to Toronto (CA) throughout 
the entire year, and SAUDIA will continue its flight service to Jeddah (SA) during the winter. Ethiopian Airlines will 
even increase frequencies on its flights connecting Vienna with Addis Ababa (ET).
Keep immigration and departure regulations in mind to ensure a relaxing holiday trip
Many countries such as the USA have already announced an easing of entry requirements for travellers. 
Nevertheless, individual regulations continue to exist across the globe. People who are properly prepared will be 
able to enjoy a more relaxed journey in any case. Vienna Airport recommends that travellers inform themselves 
about the necessary forms to be filled out as well as entry requirements before starting their journey, either 
contacting the airline they have booked the flight with or their travel agency.
 
The website of the Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs provides an overview of current travel 
regulations at www.bmeia.gv.at/reise-services/laender. The airlines also make precise travel information available 
on their own websites.

 'Half-term holidays are back and so - briefly - are airline profits,' said Lex in the FT[1]. Ryanair, which was 'burning 
through €200m a week' at the height of the pandemic, notched up a respectable €225m profit in the last quarter. 
The Irish budget airline warned that the winter ahead was likely to prove 'challenging'. And not just financially. The 
board is bracing for conflict over plans to delist Ryanair from the London Stock Exchange - a move described by 
CEO Michael O'Leary as an 'inevitability'. If it does happen, it will spell 'another blow' to the 'dwindling' London 
market. 
O'Leary's 'disdain' for 'the dead hand of Brussels bureaucracy' is well known, said Ben Marlow in The Daily 
Telegraph[2]. And it's 'clearly not in the company's interest to cut itself off from the biggest pool of capital in Europe'. 
But Ryanair, which is also listed in Dublin and New York, argues it has little choice. The move has been on the 
cards since Brexit - 'because EU rules demand that European airlines must be majority-owned and controlled by 
nationals of the bloc' (or a handful of EFTA countries, including Switzerland). Consequently, trading volumes in the 
City have fallen dramatically. 
'If it's okay for Swiss investors to own a slice...there is no logic in denying UK investors,' agreed Nils Pratley in The 
Guardian[3]. This is primarily 'a political failure' on the part of the UK and EU to tie up 'a Brexit loose- end that 
should have been settled in about five minutes of negotiation'. As an airline, Ryanair is clearly a special case, said 
Reuters. Yet the general direction of travel isn't encouraging for London, whose blue-chip index has substantially 
underperformed the European Stoxx index this year. Ryanair's 'high-profile de-listing' may not be the last.

Wizz Air warned yesterday that it would be plunged back into losses this winter, just as it posted its first quarterly 
profit since before the pandemic. The airline said that it would have to cut ticket prices to encourage people to fly 
this winter, which was likely to force it back into the red after reporting an operating profit of (EURO)57m in the 
three months to the end of September.
It is a blow for the London-listed airline, coming shortly after passenger numbers had returned to near normal during 
the summer's busiest weeks.
József Váradi, chief executive, warned of a difficult winter even though Wizz had joined a small band of European 
airlines, including Ryanair and Lufthansa, that had returned to profit.
He expected to lower prices to "stimulate demand" but with fuel price and currency volatility the carrier was facing 
an operating loss of (EURO)200m this quarter. Losses could continue into early next year.
Varadi is piloting Wizz through the crisis with an aggressive expansion plan, opening new bases and taking on 
aircraft in a challenge to Ryanair, which has also cut its earnings forecast.
"We are still in an investment mode, and that creates some degree of inefficiency because we are not yet ... at full 
capacity," he said. "It is a bit of shortterm pain for long-term gain."
Wizz expects winter chill after bright summer; Airlines
Earlier this year Wizz tried to buy easyJet, the UK budget carrier, which would have given it access to flight paths 
across western Europe at a stroke; Varadi has been offered a £100m bonus if he can expand the airline rapidly.
Wizz has pledged to expand its fleet from about 150 aircraft to 500 by the end of the decade.
The results fell short of analysts' expectations, but the shares have risen 35 per cent over the past 12 months to 
trade above their pre-pandemic levels.
"In our view, the trade-off of higher costs today versus higher earnings in the future is worth making," said Alex 
Irving, an aviation analyst at Bernstein.
Wizz posted a net loss of (EURO)120.9m for the six months to the end of September, half the figure for the 
previous year, and reported a profit of (EURO)371.5m in the equivalent period in 2019.
Wizz carried 12.5m passengers in this six-month period, almost 10m of them in the final three months. Revenue 
rose 87 per cent to (EURO)880m and planes were 75 per cent full, an improvement on last year but well short of 
the more than 95 per cent load factor achieved in 2019.

The airline industry passed a milestone this week: low-cost European carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air both 
announced their first profitable quarter since before the pandemic. Yet both still expected to have to cut prices to 
spur demand in the winter months; Ryanair cut its earnings forecast and Wizz warned it would plunge back into 
losses. Most large US airlines, meanwhile, still lost money before federal pandemic aid in the third quarter and 
reined back expectations into the first half of next year. That so much of the industry managed to survive the 
pandemic, when much of the global fleet was grounded, is an achievement in itself. But returning to anything like 
pre-pandemic levels will be a long haul.
Accommodative capital markets and government largesse kept the industry on life support through the dark days of 
Covid. Although the Delta variant held back recovery this summer, especially in flights to and from the UK, the EU's 
digital Covid pass helped to support European demand. The US domestic market, meanwhile, was surprisingly 
strong. Restrictions are still being eased. The US will reopen for travellers from 33 countries, including the UK and 
EU, next Monday - marking the return of lucrative transatlantic routes.
Yet though this may release some pent-up demand for flights for holidays and to see loved ones, restrictions are 
being eased just as airlines go into the northern hemisphere winter - when they struggle at the best of times to 
make money. And the supply chain disruptions and staffing squeeze that are already weighing on broader 
economic growth are causing particular problems for the airline industry.
Airlines are still struggling for take-off FRIDAY 5 NOVEMBER 2021 The pandemic has reinforced a two-tier 
industry in Europe
Jet fuel prices have more than doubled over the past year. The tight labour market is making life especially difficult 
for US carriers, many of which encouraged staff to take early retirement or voluntary leave during the pandemic. 
Now, worker shortages ranging from pilots and cabin staff to baggage handlers and check-in workers is making it 
hard for carriers to deal with the bounceback in demand.
US carriers have recently had to cancel hundreds of flights as weather disruptions caused cascaded problems 
thanks to shortages of spare crews and capacity. Similar problems occurred in the summer when demand first 
sprang back. They have left industry executives puzzling over how many seats they should sell in the holiday period 
from Thanksgiving to New Year - and passengers hesitating over travel plans.
An added pressure for the industry is that higher-margin business travel is still recovering less quickly than leisure 
traffic. Uncertainty over whether business travel will ever get back to where it was before Covid, with executives 
learning to hold meetings by Zoom instead, makes long-range planning especially difficult. Although industry 
executives are confident leisure demand will rebound strongly, growing consciousness over climate change may yet 
change consumer habits.
In Europe, the pandemic has reinforced a two-tier industry, which before the pandemic saw a few profitable airlines 
such as the low-cost carriers and BA owner IAG at the top. The US industry has consolidated around a few 
successful airlines through mergers, but European governments have been keen to protect their carriers, many of 
them now heavily indebted, making consolidation www.hard.UK and EU regulators are weighing when to reimpose 
"use it or lose it" rules, which force airlines either to use their slots or hand them back. These have been suspended 
since the start of Covid. Nearly 18 months into the crisis, letting competitive forces loose again could help to 
rationalise the market.

make money. And the supply chain disruptions and staffing squeeze that are already weighing on broader 
economic growth are causing particular problems for the airline industry.
Airlines are still struggling for take-off FRIDAY 5 NOVEMBER 2021 The pandemic has reinforced a two-tier 
industry in Europe
Jet fuel prices have more than doubled over the past year. The tight labour market is making life especially difficult 
for US carriers, many of which encouraged staff to take early retirement or voluntary leave during the pandemic. 
Now, worker shortages ranging from pilots and cabin staff to baggage handlers and check-in workers is making it 
hard for carriers to deal with the bounceback in demand.
US carriers have recently had to cancel hundreds of flights as weather disruptions caused cascaded problems 
thanks to shortages of spare crews and capacity. Similar problems occurred in the summer when demand first 
sprang back. They have left industry executives puzzling over how many seats they should sell in the holiday period 
from Thanksgiving to New Year - and passengers hesitating over travel plans.
An added pressure for the industry is that higher-margin business travel is still recovering less quickly than leisure 
traffic. Uncertainty over whether business travel will ever get back to where it was before Covid, with executives 
learning to hold meetings by Zoom instead, makes long-range planning especially difficult. Although industry 
executives are confident leisure demand will rebound strongly, growing consciousness over climate change may yet 
change consumer habits.
In Europe, the pandemic has reinforced a two-tier industry, which before the pandemic saw a few profitable airlines 
such as the low-cost carriers and BA owner IAG at the top. The US industry has consolidated around a few 
successful airlines through mergers, but European governments have been keen to protect their carriers, many of 
them now heavily indebted, making consolidation www.hard.UK and EU regulators are weighing when to reimpose 
"use it or lose it" rules, which force airlines either to use their slots or hand them back. These have been suspended 
since the start of Covid. Nearly 18 months into the crisis, letting competitive forces loose again could help to 
rationalise the market.

 By EUvsDisinfo[1] 
The Lukashenka regime's goal is painfully clear: there can be no independent media. 
EUvsDisinfo has been regularly monitoring how the illegitimate Lukashenka regime abuses its legal system and the 
security apparatus to shut down the very few remaining independent voices. The targets include journalists, 
regionaloutlets, Telegram channels and their followers and readers. 
The crackdown began after the rigged elections in August 2020, and there are so many cases and examples 
thereof that naming all of them would require hundreds of pages. Below we summarise the steps taken by the 
Lukashenka regime in the last six months. 
A more thorough picture is offered byJustice for Journalists[2]. In 2020 this London-based NGO collected more 
than1,500 documented cases of attacks[3]or threats against journalists in Belarus. Additionally, the Belarusian 
Association of Journalists has collecting similar data covering the period ofJanuary-September 2021[4]. 
 May 
 One of the largest regional newspapers, Intex-Press, ran an interview withSviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. The local 
prosecutor summoned the editor and turned to the court, which foundthe interview extremist. The editor was fined 
and the newspaper received an official warning. State-owned and private distribution networks subsequentlyrefused 
to sell the newspaper[5]fearing a backlash from the authorities. 
GUBOPiK (The Main Directorate for Combating Organised Crime and Corruption)published[6]a list of 40 'extremist' 
Telegram channels. This means that people who reposted content from these channels risk committing an 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
administrative offence. This means that these people facethreats of violence and revenge if they refuse to 'repent' 
on camera and they are guaranteed a prison term under squalid conditions for up to several months. 
Central and regional offices of the largest independent media outletTUT.BY[7]were searched, as well as the homes 
of editor in chief Maryna Zolotova and several journalists. The authorities accused the leadership of financial 
manipulation and a criminal investigation was launched. Zolotova, journalists, and other personnel were imprisoned 
and the website was blocked in Belarus. In a matter of days some of the journalists regrouped in exile and created 
a new website,zerkalo.io[8]. 
After the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to capture journalist Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega,forced video confessions[9]were broadcast on state TV and used as advertisements on YouTube to 
promote Telegram channel Zhioltyye Slivy, believed to be controlled by security services. 
 June 
 According to a report by The International Strategic Action Network for Security,Belarusian commentators are in a 
minorityon weekly news[10]programmes on three Belarusian state-owned TV channels.Instead, pro-Kremlin 
propagandists of Russian and Ukrainian origin prevail as guest commentators. They use their on-air time to spread 
a set of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives concerning Belarus, the Baltic states and Poland, Ukraine, 
and the West as a whole while Belarusian journalists are fired for their views. 
The Ministry of Justicebegan an examination[11]of the Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ), demanding that 
BAJ present thousands of documents within a few days. 
The Ministry of Interior designated the most popular independent media outlet, TUT.BY, and all its social media 
accounts as extremist. The motivation behind this step was to close down TUT.BY's Telegram channel that had at 
the time almost 600,000 subscribers. 
Yellow Plums (Zhioltyye Slivy), the key disinformation-spreading Telegram channel controlled by the Belarusian 
security services, announced the creation of an 'initiative group ofpro-governmental bloggers[12]'. However, the 
Telegram and YouTube channels and Instagram accounts mentioned were not popular, as the largest Telegram 
channel on the list had only 8,000 subscribers and the most popular YouTube account 21,000. 
Belarusian investigative journalist Dzianis Ivashyn, detained in March 2021 on dubious charges,had a heart 
attack[13]in prison. Ivashyn is 42 and had not had heart problems earlier. 
 July 
 The government terminated the accreditation of a correspondent office of the European Radio for Belarus 
(Euroradio) in Minsk. 
Sports journalist and author of the popularYoutube channel ChestnOK[14](72,300 followers) Alexander Ivulin was 
arrested. 
A well-known journalist and media manager, Andrei Alexandrov, wascharged[15]with high treason which is 
punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment. 
The editor of Nasha Niva, Yahor Martsinovich, and three other employees were detained on criminal charges. 
Martsinovich was beaten during detention and Nasha Niva's website was blocked. 
Following the crackdown on TUT.BY and the closure of its website, Onliner became the largest independent media 
website. Unsurprisingly, the apartment of Onliner journalist Nastasya Zanko was searched. 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
By early 2021 there were around twenty independent media outlets left in regions of Belarus outside of Minsk. 
Around half of them were attacked by security services on 8-9 July 2021. 
In Brest region, searches of editorial offices and apartments of journalists targeted all the remaining six independent 
media outlets. As for other regions, the apartments of about ten workers ofStrong News[16]were searched and 
equipment was seized. 
Orsha regional portal[17]was targeted, its editor Igor Kazmerchak was detained on criminal charges. 
The Telegram channel ofHrodna.Life[18]was declared extremist. 
An apartment belonging to a journalist working forbobr.by[19]website was searched. 
By 12 July, over 30 journalists were imprisoned in Belarus. A number of well-known Belarusian journalists, 
concerned about their safety in the light of the massive crackdown, relocated from Belarus. 
 August 
 After widely covering repression against athletes, the popular sport website Tribunaand its social media accounts 
were classified as extremist. 
The website of regional independent media Ex-press.by was blocked at the request of the Ministry of Information. 
A photographer of Novy Chasnewspaper was sentenced to 15 days of prison and the newspaper was denied its 
printing services. 
Popular blogger Vadim Yermashuk, whose Instagram account has over 45,000 subscribers, was detained for 
unknown reasons. 
The largest independent news agency, BelaPAN, and associated news internet portal Naviny.by were searched for 
the second time since January 2021. 
The court declared all publications of the largest media portal TUT.BY and an associated website, Zerkalo.io, as 
extremist. TUT.BY's publications arede factothe largest electronic archive of modern Belarusian history. Declaring it 
as extremist means the regime wishes to destroy it and rewrite history using repressive means. TUT.BY's chief 
editor, several top managers and a few journalists remained behind bars. 
Raman Pratasevich, the journalist captured in May after the forced landing of a Ryanair plane, gave an interview to 
pro-Kremlin RT and mentioned plans to launch a new media outlet. Sofia Sapega, Pratasevich's girlfriend, who was 
also arrested, was interviewed by one of the well-known Belarus 1 TV propagandists. Sapega said that she cannot 
rule out that the Ryanair incident was staged by Raman's colleagues and that the KGB was not on board. Excerpts 
from an earlier interview with Pratasevich were also shown, where he claims that the Ryanair incident was likely 
aprovocation staged by his former colleague[20]. 
Access to the news websiteReform.by[21]was blocked following a decision of the Ministry of Information. This came 
after TUT.BY, Naviny.by and others were shut down by the authorities raising the popularity of Reform.by, which 
offered regular political reporting. 
Onliner.by's Editor-in-Chief Nikolai Kozlovich resigned without explanation.Onliner.by[22]is a large Belarusian 
media outlet that largely stopped reporting on socio-political issues to avoid repression. 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
By the end of August all the largest independent media outlets were either banned by the state authorities, or 
largely stopped their political reporting. 27 journalists and bloggers remain imprisoned. 
The Supreme Court approved a Ministry of Justice request to liquidate the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 
 September 
 The Belarusian authorities declared more than 200 Telegram channels as extremist. The number of Belarus-
related Telegram channels spreading disinformation, many with direct and indirect links to the Belarusian 
authorities, exceeded 150. The 80 largest, along with toxic disinformation pages on other social media,can be found 
here[23]. 
The Ministry of Information blocked access to belaruspartisan.by, freesmi.by, and 6tv.by. 
All popular and (formerly) independent news websites in Belarus were blocked for people inside Belarus. In some 
cases, the domain names were also taken offline.The exception wasOnliner.by[24],which toned down its reporting 
and was still allowed to function. 
Homes ofby.tribuna.com[25]'s chair Maksim Beresinsky and former tribuna.by journalist Andrei Maslovsky were 
searched. 
The editor of the Green Portal,a Belarusian environmental NGO, was detained for three days after her home was 
searched. 
The website ofMedia-Polesye[26], one of the largest remaining regional independent media based in the Brest 
region, was blocked. 
Radio Racyja, a Poland-based media outlet broadcasting in the Belarusian language, was blocked. 
The websiteAugust2020[27], which published stories of people tortured by the state security forces and police 
following the elections, was blocked. 
A criminal case was opened against Andrei Kukharchik, chief editor of another regional media outlet in the Brest 
region,Virtual Brest[28]. 
The Brest region in the south-west of Belarus, right on the border with Poland, had the largest number of 
independent regional media outlets. All of them have now been repressed by the state authorities. 
The Ministry of Information published tenders for scientific papers concerning the methods of increasing trust in 
state-owned media. These services are estimated at around 40.000 euros. 
 October 
 After Gennady Mozheiko published a short article about IT specialist Andrei Zeltser,who was killed by security 
forces[29]after he opened fire and killed a KGB agent during a raid, the journalist was detained and now faces two 
criminal charges. The newspaper he was working for, Komsomolskaya Pravda v Belarusi, announced the closure of 
its office in Belarus. 
The Belarusian Investigative Committee launched a criminal case against the remaining employees of the largest 
independent media TUT.BY and 'other individuals'. The criminal case concerns incitement of hatred committed by a 
group of people. The case is probably related to the coverage of the shooting of IT specialist Andrei Zeltser and 
KGB agent Dzmitry Fedasiuk in Minsk, although the coverage seemed to be neutral. 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
More than 200 people were detained and136 of them taken into custody[30]for publishing comments on the internet 
in connection with the deaths. According to human rights defenders, theirprison conditions amount to torture[31]. 
TheMinistry of Interior announced that 327 Telegram channels[32]and chats were recognised as extremist. This list 
also included SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya's Telegram[33]channel with 107,000 followers. 
The Ministry also introduced a new legal term, 'extremist formations'. In contrast to merely 'extremist', the 'extremist 
formation' means that followers of a Telegram channel can be criminally charged. The number of 'extremist 
formations' online recently reached double digits, including Nexta and Belsat. 
Dze.chat[34], a website uniting over a hundred local Telegram chats, was declared to be an 'extremist formation'. 
A man was detained by police who seized and inspected his phone. He wasdetained for 15 days[35]for sharing the 
Belsat webpage (Belsat is a Polish free-to-air satellite television channel aimed at Belarus) in his Instagram private 
chat. 
This example highlights the lengths to which the regime will go to in order to muzzle freedom of expression and 
even private communication in Belarus. It also proves that after demolishing independent media, persecuting 
journalists, blacklisting social media channels and creating legislation unheard of in the free world, the authorities 
have started going after individuals. 
With Belarus-based independent media pretty much outlawed, the state is trying to replace such voices with 
propaganda and disinformation. However, calling Deutsche Welle 'extremist' and blocking it shows that new targets 
include also foreign media that cover events in Belarus on a more or less regular basis. 
All of these actions aim to make people afraid of any information that does not come from the state. And it shows 
that the few remaining independent Belarusian journalists have incredible courage: they risk everything to offer their 
readers and followers factual information.

 The two countries have signed a series of agreements to further integrate their economies, power sector and 
taxation systems. The measures come after the EU tightened sanctions on Belarus earlier this year.Russian 
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday gave embattled Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko his backing against 
foreign "interference" during a virtual meeting aiming to move the two countries closer together. 
Putin hailed the "brotherly" ties between Russia and Belarus in a TV address after the two leaders signed a new 
package of measures in areas ranging from energy to defense. 
What were the latest talks about? 
Thursday's agreements saw Belarus and Russia align on areas of taxation, banking, industry and agriculture. 
They followed a deal reached in September to work together on 28 programs that moved toward a decades-old 
plan for a "union state" between the former Soviet Union members. 
"We will together resist any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of our sovereign states and Russia will of 
course continue to provide assistance to the brotherly Belarusian people — there is no doubt about that," Putin 
said.  
"We are striving to do everything to keep it that way forever, based on the will of our countries for unity," he added. 
Although the Eastern European partners did not discuss parliamentary or currency integration, the talks give 
Lukashenko a major boost amid tough EU sanctions imposed earlier this year. 
Why is Belarus moving closer to Russia? 
The EU clamped down on Lukashenko after he launched a ruthless crackdown on opponents to his almost 30-year 
regime. His government has jailed thousands of protesters who accused Lukashenko of rigging a 2020 election, 
even grounding a Ryanair plane to arrest a dissident blogger. 
Belarus opposition members have criticized the package of new measures.  
"In 2020 our people denied authorization for Lukashenko to sign anything on their behalf," opposition leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. 
The EU has accused Lukashenko of luring migrants from Africa and the Middle East before pushing them across 
the borders of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in recent months as payback for the bloc's sanctions. 
Russia 's Putin backs 'brotherly' Belarus amid EU pressure
The situation has caused a humanitarian crisis along the EU's eastern border, with migrants forced to sleep in 
forests besieged by EU and Belarusian border guards.

 Despite a €57 million second-quarter operating profit, results ofWizz Air[1] remain under pressure. The ultra-low-
cost airline expects current market conditions with low fares and yields to result in a third-quarter loss of around 
€200 million that will most likely extend into the fourth quarter, it reported on November 4. Results Wizz Air under 
pressure despite strong Q2. 
 While Wizz Air returned to 2019 pre-Covid levels and flew close to ten million passengers at 98 percent capacity 
and an 84 percent load factor in August, the continued impact of the virus and travel restrictions dictate the market 
situation. Demand for the peak holiday season is strong but weak in the off-season. Like its competitor Ryanair said 
earlier this week, demand needs price stimulation by offering extra-low ticket fares. Especially premium and 
commodity markets are volatile and are impacting the airline's financial performance and unit costs, CEO Jozsef 
Varadi said. 
HY1 loss of 120.9 million 
The Central European carrier reported a €120.9 million net loss for its first six months of the financial year 2022, 
compared to €-243.1 million between March and September last year. The operating loss was €51.9 million 
compared to €-245.6 million. Revenues increased to €880.4 million versus €471.2 million. Ancillary revenues were 
actually higher at €466.6 million than passenger revenues, confirming a trend since FY21. The average revenue per 
passenger was €70.5, a decrease of 3.1 percent. Wizz and Wizz Air Abu Dhabi flew 12.5 million passengers in 
HY1, of which 9.5 million alone in Q2. In Q1, Wizz reported a €114.4 million loss.[2] 
 Rising fuel prices didn't have an impact on Wizz in the first six months. On the contrary, the airline benefitted from 
a gain of €4.3 million on discontinued hedges. Its fuel bill was 3.2 percent lower to €256.9 million compared to the 
previous year. Wizz hasn't hedged fuel anymore after deciding in June to adopt a 'no hedge' policy against the US 
Dollar and jet fuel prices after evaluating costs and benefits. This could be a risk if fuel prices remain high. 
 Wizz's financial position remains strong, with €1.7 billion in total cash by the end of September, up 3.3 percent over 
March. Total borrowings stand at €3.4 billion.

 Wizz has strengthened its market share in most markets it is serving. 
Results Wizz Air under pressure despite strong Q2
 Wizz Air continues its unabated growth strategy. In the past six months, it opened new bases in Italy and has 
positioned four aircraft in Rome and two each in Naples and Venice. This helped to grow its market share in Italy 
from three to nine percent. 
Despite foregoing its attempts to enter the Norwegian domestic market, it continues to base four aircraft in Oslo. 
Basis in Tirana, Sarajevo, Skopje, and Vilnius will be reinforced with one additional aircraft at each base, bringing 
the total number of aircraft in this region to sixteen. The UK will also be further developed but this depends on 
getting slots at London Gatwick. Wizz Air will have 44 bases next summer and operate 1.155 routes, chasing 
opportunities as other carriers reduce the capacity for next year. 
 Abu Dhabi is now coming into full swing as the Gulf region has relaxed travel restrictions, finally allowing its 
subsidiary to grow its potential since the delayed start last year. Wizz has announced the launch of seven new 
routes out of Abu Dhabi for the coming weeks to Sarajevo, Odesa, Muscat, Almaty, Sohag, Baku, and Kutaisi. In 
the coming months, Alexandria, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Tirana will be added while flights out of Hungary will connect 
via Abu Dhabi instead of via Dubai from next April. 
Ukraine to be the next big market 
The next battleground will be Ukraine. Thanks to the new Open Skies agreement between the EU and Ukraine that 
was signed in October, the market is now open for more competition. Wizz will use this opportunity to base another 
seven aircraft there from summer 2022. Five additional aircraft in Kyiv bring the fleet there to eight, while Lviv will 
get two extra Airbus[3] A321neo's to get to three based aircraft. That Ukraine will become a battleground was 
confirmed by Ryanair's Michael O'Leary on November 1, when he announced that the Irish carrier will also reinforce 
its presence here. 
 Wizz Air ended the second quarter with a fleet of 144 Airbus A320ceo and neo-family aircraft, having taken delivery 
of thirteen A321neo's in this first half year and redelivered six A320neo's that had been in storage. The fleet will 
grow to 170 aircraft by September next year as it has advanced deliveries of new ones and has extended the short-
term lease of existing aircraft. The average seat count will grow to 216 next summer as more A321neo's come in 
and to 225 in FY24. 
Long-term, Varadi repeated his remarks from June that Wizz plans to grow its fleet to some 500 aircraft by the end 
of the decade. Half of them will be based in its Central East European markets, which will require further growth in 
this region. 
Wizz to recruit 2.700 new staff to prepare for growth 
To prevent any short-staffing issues in Q1 and Q2 from happening again and to prepare for growth, the carrier has 
started rehiring cockpit and cabin crew after laying of twenty percent in March 2020. It wants to bring its workforce 
to 6.700 next summer, more than the 5.000 it had at the high point in 2019 and 4.000 at the low point during the 
pandemic. 
Varadi said that it is more difficult to attract cabin crew than pilots as they have more options elsewhere, but the 
carrier succeeded in hiring 800 cabin crew in the past months. It has reinstated seventy percent of the 300 pilots 
that were laid off at the start of the pandemic. Wizz continues to organize its workforce through its own contract 
model instead of through union representation as it thinks this suits it best. 
 Despite a strong Q2, Wizz's results will remain under pressure in HY2. The expected Q3 loss of €200 million, 
which compares to €-142 million last year, is driven by three factors, said CFO Jourik Hooghe. First, the overall 
trading environment with very short bookings requires price stimulation but lowers revenues per seat kilometer. 
Second, a headwind in a volatile commodity market. And third, the suboptimal productivity of its fleet and crew with 
higher crew costs per kilometer. This makes the current FY22 a year of transition, but from spring 2022 (FY23), 
Wizz should be fully ramped up and operate at peak levels 'to make sure we deliver fifty percent growth compared

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - November 4, 2021 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Costco Wholesale Corporation COST[1], 
QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM[2], Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT[3], Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ICE[4] and 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[5]. Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Costco, 
Qualcomm and Applied Materials The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. 
Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Costco, Qualcomm, and 
Applied Materials. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our 
analyst team today. 
You can seeall of today's research reports here  > > >[6] 
Shares ofCostcohave outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past three-month period 
(+14.3% vs. +4.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company's growth strategies, better price management, 
decent membership trend and increasing penetration of e-commerce business reinforce its position. The strategy to 
sell products at discounted prices has helped draw customers seeking both value and convenience. These factors 
have been aiding in registering impressive sales and earnings numbers. 
Costco put up a decent performance in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. While the top line missed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate, the bottom line marked the second straight beat. Both the metrics grew year over year. Also, Costco 
maintained a stellar comps run. While aforementioned factors raise optimism, supply chain bottlenecks and higher 
labor and freight costs remain concerns. 
(You canread the full research report on Costco here  > > >[7]) 
Shares ofQualcommhave underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+4.8% vs. 
+18.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that Qualcomm is likely to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater long-term 
visibility. The chipmaker anticipates witnessing healthy growth momentum, driven by the ramp-up in 5G-enabled 
chips and higher demand for digital transformation in the cloud economy.

However, high research and development costs are likely to strain its margins. Severe competition from major 
players, huge concentration risks, and softness in demand from China might impair its growth potential. Global chip 
shortage in the semiconductor industry as a result of supply-chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic is a 
major headwind. 
(You canread the full research report on QUALCOMM here  > > >[8]) 
Shares ofApplied Materialshave outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry 
over the past year (+117.7% vs. +99.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that Applied Materials is benefiting from 
strong momentum across Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services. Further, solid demand for silicon in 
several applications across various markets remains a tailwind. Additionally, growing usage of OLED technology in 
smartphones, televisions and computers, remained positive. 
Furthermore, increased customer spending in foundry and logic on the back of rising need for specialty nodes in 
automotive, power, 5G rollout, IoT, communications and image sensor markets, is a major positive. Also, strong 
momentum in conductor etches is benefiting the company's position in DRAM and NAND. Moreover, the company 
remains optimistic about increasing DRAM spending. However, mounting expenses and rising market competition 
remain overhangs.

Russia 's Putin backs 'brotherly' Belarus amid EU pressure

Nov 04, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 The two countries have signed a series of agreements to further integrate their economies, power sector and 
taxation systems. The measures come after the EU tightened sanctions on Belarus earlier this year.Russian 
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday gave embattled Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko his backing against 
foreign "interference" during a virtual meeting aiming to move the two countries closer together. 
Putin hailed the "brotherly" ties between Russia and Belarus in a TV address after the two leaders signed a new 
package of measures in areas ranging from energy to defense. 
What were the latest talks about? 
Thursday's agreements saw Belarus and Russia align on areas of taxation, banking, industry and agriculture. 
They followed a deal reached in September to work together on 28 programs that moved toward a decades-old 
plan for a "union state" between the former Soviet Union members. 
"We will together resist any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of our sovereign states and Russia will of 
course continue to provide assistance to the brotherly Belarusian people — there is no doubt about that," Putin 
said.  
"We are striving to do everything to keep it that way forever, based on the will of our countries for unity," he added. 
Although the Eastern European partners did not discuss parliamentary or currency integration, the talks give 
Lukashenko a major boost amid tough EU sanctions imposed earlier this year. 
Why is Belarus moving closer to Russia? 
The EU clamped down on Lukashenko after he launched a ruthless crackdown on opponents to his almost 30-year 
regime. His government has jailed thousands of protesters who accused Lukashenko of rigging a 2020 election, 
even grounding a Ryanair plane to arrest a dissident blogger. 
Belarus opposition members have criticized the package of new measures.  
"In 2020 our people denied authorization for Lukashenko to sign anything on their behalf," opposition leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. 
The EU has accused Lukashenko of luring migrants from Africa and the Middle East before pushing them across 
the borders of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in recent months as payback for the bloc's sanctions. 
Russia 's Putin backs 'brotherly' Belarus amid EU pressure
The situation has caused a humanitarian crisis along the EU's eastern border, with migrants forced to sleep in 
forests besieged by EU and Belarusian border guards.

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] October 2021 traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 11.3 million as air-
travel demand continues to recover in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) 
in the period was 84% compared with 73% in October 2020. The airline operated more than 71,500 flights last 
month. 
Ryanair's October traffic also shows a sequential improvement of 6.6%. October's load factor is also an 
improvement from 81% in September. 
Despite improving from the pandemic-driven lows, Ryanair's traffic continues to be significantly below the pre-
pandemic levels. The airline's October 2021 traffic declined 18% from the comparable period in 2019. 
Ryanair recently reported its second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2021) financial numbers. The carrier's 
earnings of $1.16 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80. Quarterly revenues of $2,104 
million also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,338.8 million. However, the top line increased 
significantly year over year with improvement in traffic, thanks to the rollout of the EU Digital Covid Certificates, 
which facilitate travel with the European Union during the pandemic. The easing of coronavirus-led travel 
restrictions also drove traffic. 
Amid softness in travel demand from the pre-pandemic levels, U.S. airlines such as United Airlines UAL[2], 
Southwest Airlines LUV[3] and Spirit Airlines SAVE[4] have incurred losses in the third quarter of 2021. 
Nevertheless, their third-quarter performances show significant improvement on a year-over-year basis, thanks to 
easing coronavirus-led restrictions and uptick in air-travel demand from the pandemic-led lows.

Lufthansa data shows return to black on stronger summer demand
Lufthansa data shows return to black on stronger summer demand

Frankfurt-based air carrier Lufthansa made a small operating profit in the summer on the back of strong demand for 
its air freight services and a recovery in ticket sales, chief executive Carsten Spohr said on Wednesday.
During the year as a whole, Spohr is aiming to at least halve the operating loss - adjusted earnings before interest 
and tax - that the airline incurred during 2020, the year of the pandemic.
Last year, Lufthansa saw an operating loss of almost 5.5 billion euros (6.4 billion dollars).
"With rising demand for business travel and a record result of Lufthansa Cargo we have mastered another 
milestone on our way out of the crisis: We are back to black. We confirm our leading position among the world's 
largest airline groups," Spohr said.
For 2022, Lufthansa is planning to increase its service to around 70 per cent of pre-crisis levels.
During the third - summer - quarter, Lufthansa almost doubled turnover compared to the same quarter last year to 
5.2 billion euros. Despite costs related to reducing staff, the airline booked an operating profit of 17 million euros for 
the quarter, against a loss last year of almost 1.3 billion euros.
Analysts had expected a small loss.
The net loss came in at 72 million euros, contrasted with a net loss of 1.97 billion euros in the third quarter last year.
The company noted a significant increase in new bookings that are now back at 80 per cent of pre-crisis levels. 
Lufthansa Cargo, which came through the pandemic largely unscathed, posted a renewed record with adjusted 
operating profit at 301 million euros.
Lufthansa data shows return to black on stronger summer demand
Lufthansa's budget subsidiary Eurowings posted pre-tax profits of 108 million euros, while Lufthansa Technik, the 
maintenance unit, lifted adjusted pre-tax profits to 155 million euros for the quarter
Catering subsidiary LSG Sky Chefs also posted a profit.
The network airlines - Austrian, Swiss and Brussels - were able to cut their losses by comparison with a year ago.
Lufthansa said that new bookings on its transatlantic routes had returned to around 80 per cent of 2019 levels 
following the announcement of a planned opening of the United States to travellers from Europe from next week.
The airline is continuing to cut staff. At the end of September, it had a total complement of 107,000. German staff 
have been cut this year by 4,000, with a further 3,000 to go.
On Monday, Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier, posted operating profits for the third quarter at 245 million 
euros.

Ryanair on war path with Lisbon over Morocco flights

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has accused the Portuguese Ministry of Infrastructure and the country's civil aviation 
authority (Autoridade Nacional da Aviação Civil - ANAC) of blocking it from opening three new routes from Lison to 
Morocco, but the regulator said the airline had failed to meet deadlines and legal requirements.
The routes and flights affected are Lisbon to Agadir on October 31, November 1, 3, and 5; Lisbon to Fes on 
October 31 and November 4; and Lisbon to Marrakech on November 1 and 4. Flights from Porto to Marrakech 
would operate as scheduled.
Portuguese news agency Lusa cited an ANAC spokesperson as saying that Ryanair had not submitted all 
documents required in time despite several requests from the regulator. "It would be illegal to grant the 
authorisation in violation of the prevailing law," the spokesperson said, adding that ANAC would "protect, indemnify 
and/or compensate" affected passengers as applicable.
"Ryanair already has traffic rights to fly from Portugal to Morocco, successfully operating flights between Portugal 
and Morocco for over three years and there is no good reason for this unlawful action, which is a clear breach of 
European Union law, on the operation of the EU Open Skies agreement," Ryanair's commercial director, Jason 
McGuinness, said in a statement. He said more than 3,000 passengers were affected by the cancellation of the 
flights on the routes from October 31.
The airline said it had repeatedly tried to secure permission for the routes over the past month, "but the faceless 
bureaucrats from the Ministry of Infrastructure all departed for their holiday break on Friday evening, refusing to 
issue the routine permissions, demonstrating total indifference to the chaos they have caused to over 3,000 
Portuguese passengers whose travel plans to Morocco on the busiest weekend of the year are now in tatters".
Ryanair has repeatedly been on a war path with Lisbon over its protection of flag carrier TAP Air Portugal (TP, 
Lisbon). In the latest tiff, the airline has accusing TAP of hoarding unused airport slots at Lisbon Portela Airport, 
preventing Ryanair from obtaining sufficient slots and resulting in the cancellation of 700 flights and three Lisbon 
routes to Tours (France), Oujda (Morocco), and Bari (Italy) this winter. It has called on the Portuguese government 
and the European Commission to intervene.

Consumer watchdog frustrated at lack of bite CMA wants to be granted similar powers to those it enjoys in the

Consumer watchdog frustrated at lack of bite; CMA wants to be granted 
similar powers to those it enjoys in the competition arena

British Airways and Ryanair customers who had turned to the UK competition regulator in the hope it would force 
the airlines to refund them for flights they were prevented from taking by pandemic lockdown restrictions were left 
disappointed last month.
The Competition and Markets Authority, which launched the investigation last December, dropped the case after 
concluding it was "insufficiently certain" it would win in the courts. The watchdog had previously said the two airlines 
might have breached consumer law by offering vouchers or to rebook flights rather than cash refunds.
At the time, Andrea Coscelli, CMA's chief executive, said the uncertainty meant he could "no longer justify the 
further expense of public money". The decision and approach to the case highlighted the limits of the CMA as a 
consumer protection watchdog with it often having to resort to the courts to fulfil that role.
The airline refund case was just one of many issues that unhappy customers complained to the watchdog about 
during the pandemic. These ranged from refusals to pay refunds for cancelled holidays to private Covid-19 travel 
tests providers overcharging or failing to deliver results on time, if at all.
Within days of the first lockdown last March, the complaints began pouring in, hitting a peak of 15,000 a week.
Consumer watchdog frustrated at lack of bite CMA wants to be granted similar powers to those it enjoys in the 
competition arena
The regulator, which has no consumer-fining powers, has at times seemed just as frustrated as the public. It has 
been waiting more than two years for powers that would enable it to crack down on consumer malpractice and it is 
still unclear when ministers might finally legislate. The government closed its consultation on these new powers last 
month.
Coscelli told the Financial Times that the proposals to bolster its toolkit would "help us respond more quickly and 
effectively to emerging problems", adding: "We know there is more that can be done to ensure stronger protections 
and better outcomes for consumers."
He is looking to secure similar powers to those it has in the competition arena, a role it has expanded post-Brexit 
when the CMA replaced the European Commission as the UK's highest antitrust authority. The watchdog can fine 
companies up to 10 per cent of global turnover for any breach of competition law.
"If we stay close to [the proposals] as they are now, it is a game changer on the consumer protection side," Coscelli 
explained.
"The CMA's main gripe is that it has never had the fining powers and the ability to run a [consumer protection] case 
through to a final decision with penalties," said Becket McGrath, competition partner at Euclid Law. "The CMA 
wants to have the equivalent set of [consumer] powers as its competition powers that it can use to effectively take 
enforcement action against consumer law practices which evolve at a [fast] rate."
This has left the UK with a consumer watchdog with few teeth despite the fact the CMA has a statutory duty to 
promote competition for the benefit of consumers and can pursue businesses that infringe consumer laws through 
unfair trading terms, for example, or misleading prices. But its only recourse is through the courts, which can turn 
into a protracted and costly process.
Elsewhere in Europe, the picture is mixed. The Netherlands, France and Poland, for instance, can levy fines on 
companies of up to 10 per cent of annual turnover for unfair consumer practices. In Italy, the national competition 
watchdog can fine companies up to (EURO)5m for unfair consumer practices.
The CMA's lack of bite was further underlined in August. Ministers bruised by blanket press coverage of poor 
service and high charges from providers of compulsory Covid-19 travel tests - a market the government created - 
ordered the watchdog to conduct a "rapid high-level review".
Unable to levy fines against providers that were breaking the law, or act swiftly to force them to comply, the CMA 
opened enforcement cases against several test providers. But its limited powers meant there would be no 
clampdown during the busy summer holiday period. Instead, it urged the government to better regulate the market it 
had created.
The fining powers it needed were first promised by the government in 2019. The government renewed that pledge 
last year, but despite the consultation having closed it has so far not committed to when it might act. The 
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the FT in a statement it would do so when 
parliamentary time allowed.
Nevertheless, the CMA has used its limited tools to some effect during the pandemic. In October last year, it 
secured £203m in refunds for Virgin Holiday customers as well as promises from other package holiday operators 
to repay customers.
But not everyone waiting on refunds for cancelled holidays has been so fortunate. Just over a week after dropping 
the case against BA and Ryanair, the CMA announced it was taking the owner of Teletext Holidays to court over 
slow progress in repaying customers for package deals cancelled as a result of the pandemic. Coscelli pointed out 
it was "the kind of issue that could be resolved at pace and met with fines" if the CMA received the consumer 
powers promised by the government.

Nov 03, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, U.S. carriers, such as SkyWest SKYW[1], Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] and Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[3] released their respective third-quarter 2021 earnings reports. European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[4] also grabbed headlines on the earnings front, releasing its second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 
2021) earnings report. While the top line benefited from increased traffic at all the above carriers, high fuel price per 
gallon hurt the bottom line. 
We remind investors that the third-quarter earnings reports of the likes of Southwest Airlines LUV[5] and American 
Airlines AAL[6] were discussed in detail in the previous week's write up[7]. On the non-earnings front, JetBlue 
Airways' JBLU[8] decision to expand its codeshare agreement with Iceland's Icelandair dominated headlines. 
Recap of the Latest Key Events 1. SkyWest's third-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding $1.26 from non-recurring 
items) of $1.45 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The bottom line increased 
significantly on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the recovery in air-travel demand. Revenues of $744.8 million also 
outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674 million. The top line jumped 63% year over year owing to a 
67% increase in block hours on completed flights[9]. 
SkyWest currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[10]. 
2. Spirit Airlines' third-quarter 2021 loss (excluding 83 cents from non-recurring items) of 69 cents per share was 
narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 95 cents and the year-ago loss of $2.32. Operating 
revenues of $922.6 million increased in excess of 100% year over year. This massive year-over-year jump reflects 
improving air-travel demand as COVID-19 cases fall and the threat of the Delta variant recedes in the United 
States. Revenues increased 7.4%, sequentially. Average fuel cost per gallon in the September quarter rose to 
$2.14 from $1.27 as oil price shoots up[11]. 
3. Allegiant's third-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding $1.52 from non-recurring items) of 66 cents per share missed 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. However, the bottom line surged more than 100% on a year-over-year 
basis. Sentiments regarding air-travel demand are bullish now (owing to increased inoculation programs) compared 
with the year-ago quarter when the company reported a loss of $4.28 per share. Operating revenues of $459.5 
Airline Stock Roundup: Q3 Earnings Results From ALGT, SKYW & SAVE , JBLU in Focus
million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $446.1 million and increased more than 100% on a year-over-year 
basis. Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) surged 66.7% to $2.20 in the quarter[12]. 
4. Ryanair reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2021) earnings of $1.16 per share, which fell short 
of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80. In the year-ago period, the company incurred an adjusted loss of 12 
cents per share due to coronavirus-led weakness in air-travel demand. Quarterly revenues of $2,104 million in the 
second quarter of fiscal 2022 fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,338.8 million. The top line increased 
significantly year over year with improvement in traffic, courtesy of the rollout of the EU Digital Covid Certificates. 
Easing of coronavirus-led travel restrictions also drove traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased 67% 
year over year, partly due to higher jet fuel prices[13]. 
5. In a bid to boost connectivity, JetBlue expanded its codeshare deal with Icelandair. The agreement offers 
customers multiple ways to book and connect their travel between JetBlue and Icelandair's networks across Europe 
and North America. A codeshare deal enables flight sharing, by dint of which a passenger has the free will to avail 
any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number. With 
international travel demand gradually rising as countries reopen their borders to vaccinated travelers, the expanded 
codeshare agreement should help drive traffic for JetBlue. 
 Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

Ryanair Holdings is set to delist from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) citing diminishing interest in its shares from 
UK investors post Brexit.
"I think we will probably delist sometime in the next six months," chief executive Michael O'Leary said during an 
earnings call.
According to the Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) parent, as part of the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which 
came into effect on January 1 of this year, the voting rights of non-EU (including the UK) shareholders have been 
restricted in that they are no longer allowed to buy Ryanair ordinary shares (although they can buy American 
Depository Receipts which are listed on the US Nasdaq).
"The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for trading in shares of EU corporates post 
Brexit and is, potentially, more acute for Ryanair as a result of the long-standing prohibition on non-EU citizens 
purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares being extended to UK nationals following Brexit," it said. "The Board of 
Ryanair is now considering the merits of retaining the Standard listing on the LSE."
Aside from its ADRs, Ryanair also has a primary listing on the Euronext Dublin bourse. It said that despite 
depressed demand for its stock from UK investors, it did foresee its EU shareholding growing over time.

Ryanair is preparing to bring to an end its 20-year listing on the London Stock Exchange to comply with EU rules 
following Brexit as it announced it had swung back to profit for the first time since 2019.
The Irish airline said yesterday it had begun a review into whether to give up its London quote, which is a secondary 
listing, to focus on its primary market of Dublin. "I think it is an inevitability post-Brexit," chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said. "I think we will probably delist sometime in the next six months."
The revelation came as Ryanair reported a net profit of (EURO)225m in the three months to the end of September, 
its first since the last quarter of 2019, the period before coronavirus disruption swept through aviation.
O'Leary said the issue was down to EU rules that insist EU airlines are majority owned and controlled by nationals 
from within the bloc, or from Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.
Ryanair barred non-EU individuals from buying shares in the company and extended this to institutions and 
individuals in the UK at the start of this year. O'Leary said this meant the airline was 100 per cent controlled by EU 
shareholders, but added "we are not yet 100 per cent EU-owned".
He told the Financial Times: "We would have had, pre-Brexit, about 20 per cent of the stock held or controlled here 
in the UK. And we need to reduce that ... over the next couple of years."
Ryanair set for London delisting to meet EU rules Airlines
The UK and EU agreed to explore airline ownership rules when they signed their trade deal in December, but have 
made no progress on the issue. O'Leary said he expected Brussels to clamp down on airlines. "The EU authorities, 
I think particularly the French or the Germans, are going to take a very strong view on EU ownership. Particularly 
with a dispute between the French and the UK," he said.
For the six months to the end of September, Ryanair lost (EURO)48m, down from a (EURO)411m loss the previous 
year. In the same period in 2019, the airline reported a profit of (EURO)1.3bn.

BUDGET airline Ryanair has reported its first quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic, with shares going up 
to (EURO)16.96 compared to (EURO)16.46 registered earlier this morning.
However, the Irish-based group said it still expected to post an annual loss of up to (EURO)200m (£195.4m) as it 
would need to discount tickets this winter.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken boss of the budget carrier, told media the airline will move to a delisting from the 
London Stock Exchange.
Ryanair reported an after-tax loss of (EURO)48m for the six months to September, slightly higher than the 
(EURO)43m predicted by analysts.
A (EURO)273m loss for the first quarter implies a second quarter profit of (EURO)225m, the airline's first quarterly 
profit since October-December 2019.
Some 39.1m passengers flew with Ryanair in the six months to September, 54 per cent fewer than in the 
comparable pre-pandemic period.
It is expected to post a loss of around (EURO)100m and (EURO)200m for the financial year ending 31 March.
O'Leary lifted the group's five-year growth target to fly 225m passengers a year by 2026, from a previous forecast of 
200m.
It increased its passenger target for the financial year to March 2022 to slightly above 100m. This is compared to 
149m passengers per year before the coronavirus outbreak.

O'Leary pointed to the rollout of the EU Covid passport as the main driver of a return to short-haul travel.

Ryanair is flying more passengers, although numbers and load factors remain well below pre-pandemic levels. Air 
travel body Iata has forecast big losses for an industry whose outlook remains uncertain. Ryanair may ditch its 
secondary listing in London, where trading is minimal, as it seeks to meet EU ownership rules.
Half-term holidays are back and so - briefly - are airline profits.
Ryanair, whose low-cost, shorthaul business chimes with current demand, posted a (EURO)225m profit for the 
three months to the end of September.
Load factor was "consistently above" 80 per cent in the quarter.
The airline, which at the height of the pandemic was burning through (EURO)200m a week, generated 
(EURO)832m of free cash flow in the first half.
That marks a big reversal on outflows of (EURO)1.3bn in the same period last year.
There is no change in Ryanair's direction of travel when it comes to ownership. In the wake of Brexit, The Irish 
airline has been nudging away non-EU investors, notably British ones, to comply with EU rules.
It is now considering dropping its secondary listing in London, in another blow to the dwindling stock market.

Ryanair's bottom line. The airline will bolster its fleet with 210 of these jets over the next five years. They fit in 4 per 
cent more seats and consume 16 per cent less fuel.
Ryanair is guiding analysts to a fullyear loss of between (EURO)100m and (EURO)200m.
It knows that to sell more seats it will need to discount tickets heavily. In the latest six-month period, the average 
revenue per customer fell by a third year on year to (EURO)33.
Even before the pandemic, overcapacity was pushing down prices, resulting in average fares of (EURO)37 in 2019. 
At the same time Ryanair faces rising costs on the 20 per cent of fuel that is unhedged over the next three quarters.
Shares, up by over a third in the past year, are the priciest in the lowcost universe as a multiple of sales.
Ryanair has come through the pandemic in tolerable shape. That would make a delisting in London particularly 
galling to investors there.
But at their current price, the shares look expensive, particularly when seats on Ryanair flights are so cheap.

Nov 02, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2021) earnings of $1.16 per 
share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80. In the year-ago period, the company incurred 
adjusted loss of 12 cents per share due to coronavirus-led weakness in air-travel demand. 
Quarterly revenues of $2,104 million also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,338.8 million. The top line 
increased significantly year over year with improvement in traffic, thanks to the rollout of the EU Digital Covid 
Certificates, which facilitate travel with the European Union during the pandemic. Easing of coronavirus-led travel 
restrictions also drove traffic. 
Ryanair's profit for the quarter came in at €225 million against the year-ago quarter's loss of €225.5 million. Traffic 
soared 86% year over year to 31 million. Load factor in the period was consistently above 80%. Ryanair Holdings

 Scheduled revenues climbed 57% year over year due to surge in traffic. Ancillary revenues jumped 95% year over 
year in the reported quarter due to strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating, apart from robust 
traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by 67% year over year due to rise in sectors flown and higher 
jet fuel prices. Total operating expenses rose 47% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), had 
cash of €4.24 billion as of Sep 30, 2021, higher than €3.15 billion as of Mar 31, 2021.You can see the complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[4]. 
For fiscal 2022, the company expects to record a loss of €100-€200 million.

trading volumes have 'reduced materially during 2021'. Performance of Other Airlines United Airlines UAL[5], 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding $2.46 from non-recurring items) of $1.02 per share in the third

Ryanair losses shrink as traffic rebounds, mulls London de-listing
Ryanair losses shrink as traffic rebounds, mulls London de-listing

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) reported sharply narrowing losses for the first half as passenger numbers 
rebounded following the lifting COVID-19 travel restrictions and after it cut ticket prices.
The outlook for the full year remains challenging, the Irish airline said, as it also announced that it may de-list its 
shares from the London Stock Exchange.
Net losses shrank to (EURO)48mln in the six months to 30 September from (EURO)411mln in the same period last 
year, while revenue soared by 83% to (EURO)2.15bn as traffic jumped 128% to 39.1mln, with a 79% load factor.
Ryanair said it had reduced its average fares by 30% to (EURO)33 in the first half to stimulate bookings. 
The airline said passenger numbers rose to 11.3mln in October from 10.6mln in September and 4.1mln in October 
2020. The load factor was 84%.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said the airline had seen a surge in bookings in recent weeks for the October mid-term 
and Christmas breaks and expects this peak buoyancy to continue into Easter and summer 2022. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said the outlook for pricing and yields for the coming winter will be challenging and that it 
will have to continue to offer discounted tickets in order to stimulate bookings.
It forecast a full-year loss of (EURO)100mln-(EURO)200mln and passenger numbers of 100mln.
"This outturn will be crucially dependent on the continued rollout of vaccines and no adverse Covid-19 
developments," it cautioned.
Ryanair losses shrink as traffic rebounds, mulls London de-listing
Ryanair said trading in its shares on the LSE has reduced "materially" during 2021 and it is now considering the 
merits of retaining its London listing.
"The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for trading in shares of EU corporates post-
Brexit and is, potentially, more acute for Ryanair as a result of the long-standing prohibition on non-EU citizens 
purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares being extended to UK nationals following Brexit," it said.
The airline said its fuel requirements are 80% hedged for the fourth quarter.
Cash stood at (EURO)4.24bn at the end of September, up from (EURO)3.15bn at end-March. Net debt fell to 
(EURO)1.50bn from (EURO)2.28bn.
Ryanair took delivery of its first B737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft in June and expects to have over 65 in its fleet 
by next summer.
Shares were 0.66% higher at (EURO)16.85.

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Ryanair's outlook to stable from negative due to easing travel restrictions and improved 
vaccination rates in Europe.
The agency pointed out that Ryanair has registered a strong recovery since July, with passenger traffic reaching 
73% of 2019 levels and load factor averaging 82%.
Passenger traffic is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023 and outdo them in 2024, supported by pent-
up demand from leisure and visiting friends and relations travel, according to Fitch.
The European low-cost carrier reduced reported net debt to (EURO)1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) as of the end of 
September from (EURO)2.3 billion at the end of March, due to stronger operating cash flow on traffic recovery and 
positive changes in working capital.
The carrier held unrestricted cash of (EURO)4.2 billion at the end of September.
Ryanair expects its fleet to grow to about 620 aircraft in 2026 from 451 in 2021, with passenger traffic to reach 225 
million in 2026, up from 149 million last year.
Meanwhile, Ryanair has confirmed plans to delist from the London Stock Exchange, citing low trading volumes not 
justifying the cost related to the listing and the desire to consolidate trading liquidity to one regulated market for the 
benefit of shareholders.
The cancellation of the London listing will become effective on 20 December, with the final trading day on the 
London Stock Exchange on 17 December 2021.
Ryanair's chief executive officer Michael O'Leary told analysts earlier this month that a delisting is an "inevitability 
post-Brexit", with trading volumes through the London Stock Exchange "significantly diminished" compared with 
that of its primary Euronext listings in Dublin and Brussels.
O'Leary also pointed out that the European Commission is looking to be much more aggressive in making sure 
European airlines are European Union (EU) majority owned and controlled, adding that airlines must be seen to 
take steps to adhere to ownership regulations.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it is "considering the merits" of its London Stock Exchange 
listing following Brexit. 
Ryanair shares were 1.4% higher at EUR16.98 each in London on Monday morning. The stock has risen just over 
3.0% so far this year. 
Ryanair said trading of its in London "has reduced materially during 2021". 
"The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for trading in shares of EU corporates post-
Brexit and is, potentially, more acute for Ryanair as a result of the long-standing prohibition on non-EU citizens 
purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares being extended to UK nationals following Brexit.
"The board of Ryanair is now considering the merits of retaining the standard listing on the LSE."
Ryanair has a primary listing in the Euronext Dublin market and also has American depositary shares listed on the 
Nasdaq. 
Also on Monday, the carrier said its traffic surged in October. It carried 11.3 million passengers last month, up 
sharply from 4.1 million a year earlier. The load factor, meanwhile, improved to 84% from 73%. 
October's figure was also improved from 10.6 million in September. 
In addition, Ryanair posted a half-year revenue hike and a narrowed loss, as the budget airline benefited from a 
rebound in passenger numbers. 
Dublin-based Ryanair painted a cautious picture for the remainder of its financial year, however, deciding against 
annual guidance as it approaches a potentially difficult winter period. 
UPDATE: Ryanair October traffic improves as weighs London delisting
In the six months to September 30, revenue rose 83% year-on-year to EUR2.15 billion from EUR1.18 billion. 
Ryanair's pretax loss narrowed to EUR99.9 million, from EUR432.3 million a year earlier. Two-years ago, the airline 
booked an interim pretax profit of EUR1.26 billion.
During the period, it carried 39.1 million customers, more than doubled yearly from 17.1 million. The load factor 
improved to 79% from 72% a year prior. 
"Following a very badly disrupted Q1, which saw most Easter flights cancelled and a slower-than-expected easing 
of EU government travel restrictions in May and June, traffic rebounded in Q2 with the successful rollout of the EU 
Digital Covid Certificates in July," the company said. 
Most flight bookings are "close-in", however, meaning they were made closer to departure time. Ryanair also 
charged that in the UK, consumer confidence was hit by the "confusing and inconsistent traffic light system", which 
has since been phased out. 
UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on Thursday last week announced all remaining countries in England's red 
travel list will be removed with effect on Monday. This means arrivals will no longer need to spend 11 nights in a 
quarantine hotel at a cost of GBP2,285.
Ryanair added on Monday: "In recent weeks, we have seen a surge in bookings for the October mid-term and 
Christmas breaks, and we expect this peak buoyancy to continue into Easter and summer 2022."
However, Ryanair said its outlook for "pricing and yields" will be "challenging" in winter. 
"With the booking curve remaining very close-in, traffic recovery will require continuing price stimulation. This, 
coupled with rising costs for the small unhedged balance of our fuel needs, means that visibility for the remainder of 
FY22 is very limited," the carrier explained.
Ryanair decided against offering "meaningful" annual guidance. It does, however, expect a net loss of between 
EUR100 million and EUR200 million. Its net loss in the first half narrowed to EUR47.6 million from EUR410.5 million 
a year earlier. 
Ryanair added: "This outturn will be crucially dependent on the continued rollout of vaccines and no adverse Covid-
19 developments."
For financial 2021, it made a net loss of EUR1.02 billion.

Ryanair slams 'delusionary' Boeing in 737 Max jet price row

The boss of Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) on Monday ramped up a war of words with Boeing (BA.N), calling the U.S. 
planemaker "delusionary" for imposing what he termed a double-digit percentage price hike for 737 MAX 10 jets in 
talks this year.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also said Boeing needed to "get its shit together" after what he described as 
delays in the delivery of 65 jets from an existing MAX order, though he was "reasonably confident" they would arrive 
for the summer peak.
A Boeing spokesperson said it was committed to supporting Ryanair as a long-standing partner, but added it would 
"continue to be disciplined" in commercial decisions.
Industry sources blamed the delays on shipping problems for galleys linked to a worldwide logistics logjam.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier in September abruptly ended talks with the U.S. planemaker over an order of 737 
MAX 10 jets worth tens of billions of dollars because of differences over price. read more
Speaking on Monday following the airline's latest financial results, O'Leary said Boeing's approach was 
"delusionary".
"Boeing out of the blue sought a ... substantial double-digit price increase. I don't understand the strategy," he said, 
before reiterating that Boeing badly needs Ryanair's business. In a call with investors, O'Leary said he was having a 
"marital tantrum" with Boeing, Ryanair's long-time sole supplier.
O'Leary in September said Ryanair had been in talks to order at least 100 of the 230-seat MAX 10. read more
Sources say the dispute over MAX 10 was already rumbling when Ryanair ordered 75 more of the smaller MAX 8-
200 version in December last year.
Two industry sources said Ryanair had rejected previous lower offers on the MAX 10 since that date.
Asked on an investor call whether the price increase was compared to an earlier offer or compared to prices paid in 
the past, O'Leary declined to comment.
Ryanair slams 'delusionary' Boeing in 737 Max jet price row
Insiders say brinkmanship and flared tempers are more common in the cut-throat aerospace industry than 
executives care to admit, in contrast with the polished 'win-win' arguments favoured whenever such hard-fought 
deals are announced publicly.
Ryanair and Boeing have often clashed behind the scenes as Europe's pioneering low-cost carrier insisted on the 
lowest possible prices, echoing fraught negotiations between Airbus (AIR.PA) and some of its key low-cost 
customers.
But it is unusual for the knockabout to become public.
The spat partly reflects two sources of abnormal volatility stemming from overlapping crises, industry sources say.
First is uncertainty over the shape of the recovery, with Ryanair and Boeing appearing to bet on different paths.
While O'Leary has said Boeing is ignoring reality about prices, he has also said demand is likely to snap back 
quickly.
Second is the uncertainty that swirled around valuations for the MAX - once Boeing's most reliable cash and profit 
benchmark - in the wake of a two-year safety crisis.
The MAX 10 has struggled to keep up with runaway sales of the Airbus A320neo and the industry began the year 
uncertain how much the market would pay for it. But a deal for United Airlines to order 200 MAX 10 in June 
encouraged Boeing to set the bar higher, driving up the offer for Ryanair, market sources said.
Consultancy Ascend by Cirium said in September MAX values had increased "very slightly" as inventory declines. 
read more
With hundreds of MAX yet to be delivered after the grounding and COVID-19 crisis, sources say Ryanair believes 
prices should be set lower than previous MAX 10 offers, but the planemaker has drawn a line on the grounds that it 
would be uneconomic to produce and industry sources say the talks remain deadlocked.
Boeing declined comment on confidential talks. A Ryanair spokesman said it had nothing to add to O'Leary's 
comments. Reuters.com

       Shares of Ryanair Holdings Plc. were gaining around 2 percent in London trading after the low fares airline 
reported Monday a profit in its second quarter, compared to last year's loss, driven by significant growth in demand. 
Looking ahead for fiscal 2022, the company expects narrower loss.
 Regarding the outlook, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said, "We believe that FY22 traffic has improved to just over 
100m and (subject to winter fares) expect to record an FY22 loss of between (EURO)100m to (EURO)200m. This 
outturn will be crucially dependent on the continued rollout of vaccines and no adverse Covid19 developments."
 In the previous year of 2021, the company's loss attributable to equity holders of parent was 1.02 billion euros or 
0.9142 euros per share.
 The company said the visibility for the remainder of FY22 is very limited, and that its difficult to provide meaningful 
FY22 guidance. The outlook for pricing and yields for the winter of FY22 will be challenging.
 Further, Ryanair continues to expect to deliver accelerated growth over the next 5 years, with the growth forecast 
raised to 50 percent from 33 percent. As a result, Ryanair's pre-Covid traffic of 149 million is expected to grow to 
over 225 million guests p.a. by March 2026. The previous target was 200 million p.a.
 The company further said its growth plans over the next 5 years will create 5,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew 
and engineers.
 Ryanair, which recently invested 50 million euros in an Aviation Skills Training Centre in Dublin, plans to invest 
over 100 million euros in 2 more high skills, training centres in possibly Spain and Poland.
 The company also said its Board is now considering the merits of retaining the Standard listing on the London 
Stock Exchange or LSE. Trading on the LSE as a percentage of overall trading volume in Ryanair's ordinary shares 
has reduced materially during 2021.
 For the second quarter, profit before tax was 224.6 million euros, compared to last year's loss of 222.4 million 
euros.
 Net profit attributable to equity holders of parent was 225 million euros, compared to last year's loss of 225.5 
million euros. Earnings per share were 0.1975 euro, while prior year's loss was 0.2053 euro.
 Operating profit surged to 254.0 million euros from prior year's 10.8 million euros, with a 47 percent drop in total 
operating expenses to 1.53 billion euros.
 Total operating revenues for the second quarter surged 70 percent to 1.78 billion euros from last year's 1.05 billion 
euros.
Ryanair Turns To Profit In Q2, Sees Narrower Loss In FY22; Stock Up
 Scheduled revenues grew 57 percent year-over-year to 1.08 billion euros, and Ancillary revenues were up 95 
percent to 703.0 million euros.
 For the first half, attributable net loss narrowed to 47.6 million euros from last year's 410.5 million euros, and 
revenue climbed 83 percent to 2.15 billion euros.
 The first-half traffic rebounded by 128 percent to 39.1 million customers from 17.1 million customers a year ago. 
Load Factor was 79 percent, up 7 percentage points from 72 percent a year ago.
 In London, Ryanair shares were trading at 17.08 euros, up 2.03 percent.

       European stocks rose notably on Monday, with earnings optimism, the ruling party's solid victory in Japan's 
parliamentary election, easing travel curbs in Australia and Thailand, and stabilizing coal prices in China boosting 
sentiment.
 Monetary policy tightening remains the key market focus, with investors now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve 
meeting on Wednesday for clues on the timing of its first interest rate hike since December 2018.
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already acknowledged substantial further progress on inflation (price stability) and 
also maximum employment for QE tapering.
 On Thursday, attention turns to the Bank of England policy meeting. Market participants are pricing in a rate hike to 
curb inflation but economists narrowly predict no change.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 rose 0.6 percent to 478.51 after ending flat with a positive bias on Friday.
 The German DAX jumped 0.9 percent, France's CAC 40 index rallied 1.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 
0.6 percent.
 Swiss drug major Novartis rose over 1 percent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Scemblix 
(asciminib) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in two distinct indications.
 French pharmaceutical company Sanofi climbed 1.8 percent after HSBC upgraded the stock to "buy."
 Danish jewelry maker Pandora slumped 6.2 percent despite lifting its 2021 outlook.
 Commercial landlord Land Securities was marginally higher in London after it agreed to buy property regeneration 
company U&I Group in a £190m deal. Shares of the latter jumped as much as 72 percent.
 Airline Ryanair held steady after narrowing its first-half loss.
 Barclays declined 1.7 percent. The lender said that its chief executive Jes Staley will step down following U.K. 
regulators' investigations into his relationship with U.S. Financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who 
committed suicide in U.S. jail in 2019.
 German automaker Volkswagen rose about 1 percent amid reports that Skoda Auto is resuming production 
following a two-week outage caused by a shortage of semiconductor chips.
 In economic releases, investors shrugged off data showing that Germany's retail sales declined unexpectedly in 
September.
 Germany's retail turnover decreased 2.5 percent month-on-month in September, reversing a 1.2 percent rise in

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday posted a first half revenue hike and a narrowed loss, as the 
carrier benefited from a rebound in passenger numbers. 
The Dublin-based budget airline painted a cautious picture for the remainder of its financial year, however, deciding 
against annual guidance as it approaches a potentially difficult winter period. 
In the six months to September 30, revenue rose 83% year-on-year to EUR2.15 billion from EUR1.18 billion. 
Ryanair's pretax loss narrowed to EUR99.9 million, from EUR432.3 million a year earlier. Two-years ago, the airline

Ryanair to be opportunistic on mid-life leases

Ryanair's chief executive officer Michael O'Leary says the carrier will explore opportunities outside of its Boeing 737 
Max orderbook to build enough capacity to reach 225 million passengers per year by fiscal-year 2026.
O'Leary notes the company will look to decelerate its aircraft sales programme and increase activity in mid-life 
aircraft leasing in the long term.
"There are opportunities out there, certainly in both white tails of Airbus A320ceos and 737NGs," O'Leary 
commented during an analyst call on 1 November.
"The leasing companies are also becoming much more aggressive. Nobody really wants the older 12-14-year-old 
Ceos or NGs and if lease rates continue to fall for those, we'll be opportunistic about adding maybe another 30, 40 
or 50 of those aircraft," he added.
O'Leary emphasises this isn't a short-term target, adding: "There's no requirement for additional aircraft for the next 
two to four years."
In the quarter ended 30 September, Ryanair Group entered into an agreement to sell 10 737-800s for delivery in 
fiscal year 2022.
Two of these aircraft were sold in September 2021. The remaining eight aircraft are reflected as current assets 
within Ryanair.
The company took delivery of 20 new 737 Max 8200 aircraft in the period, with 190 units remaining on order all of 
which are expected to be delivered between now and 2025.

Ryanair has swung to a net profit of (EURO)225 million ($260 million) in the second quarter of fiscal-year 2022 from 
a (EURO)226 million loss in the same period last year as traffic began to rebound over the summer season.
Operating revenue for the three-month period grew 70% year on year to (EURO)1.1 billion, on a nearly 100% 
increase in ancillary revenue to (EURO)703 million.
This outpaced a 47% increase in operating costs to (EURO)1.5 billion as the company ramped up capacity over the 
summer season. The carrier's fuel bill rose 67% to (EURO)557 million while staff costs increased 16% to 
(EURO)192 million.
First-half scheduled revenues increased 61% to (EURO)1.3 billion with a 128% jump in traffic from to 39.1 million at 
a 79% load factor.
The carrier has raised its outlook for fiscal-year 2022 to just over 100 million passengers with an expected loss of 
between (EURO)100 million to (EURO)200 million, depending on the continued rollout of vaccines and Covid-19 
developments, pricing and yields.
The carrier reported a cash balance of (EURO)4.2 billion as of 30 September, up from (EURO)3.2 billion at 31 
March.
Net debt fell from (EURO)2.3 billion as of 31 March to (EURO)1.5 billion at 30 September.
In May, Ryanair issued a (EURO)1.2 billion five-year, unsecured bond at a coupon of 0.875%. In June the group 
repaid its maturing (EURO)850 million 1.875% bond and last week the company repaid its UK CCFF £600 million 
loan five months early. 
In June Ryanair took delivery of its first Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft from an orderbook for 210 units. The carrier 
expects to have over 65 in the group's fleet by summer 2022. Some 90% of Ryanair's fleet remains unencumbered.
During the second quarter the company agreed to sell its 10 oldest 737NGs. Two of these aircraft were delivered in 
September and the remainder will exit the fleet before the end of fiscal-year 2022.

European LCCs sceptical of SAF solution

European low-cost heavyweights Ryanair, Wizz Air and Easyjet have backed fleet renewal rather than large-scale 
investment in sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as the primary driver of sustainability for the airline industry.
This is seemingly at odds with the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) target for SAF to contribute 
around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero in 2050, compared with 13% of the 
contribution stemming from new technology.
Ryanair's chief executive officer (CEO) Michael O'Leary argues airlines have to focus on what is in their control on 
the path to carbon neutrality, the most significant being investment in fleet renewal and improving its own 
efficiencies.
"The best news we have is the new LEAP engines on the Max Gamechanger aircraft will significantly reduce our 
fuel consumption," O'Leary said during a Eurocontrol sustainability conference.
In June Ryanair took delivery of its first Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft from an orderbook for 210 units. The carrier 
expects to have over 65 in the group's fleet by summer 2022.
O'Leary says Ryanair is also committed to 12.5% SAF by 2030 but admits even this figure in this timeframe may be 
aiming high.
"That's a very ambitious target. I'm not sure if we're going to make it but it's important to set out ambitious targets 
first and see how we go about reaching them. The challenge will be the availability of SAF."
He also said passengers themselves have not been big supporters of green measures to date, noting that there is 
only 1% uptake for voluntary carbon offsetting.
Johan Lundgren, Easyjet's CEO, also agrees that there are better solutions long-term than SAF to make short-haul 
aviation more sustainable, particularly future zero-emissions aircraft technology.
"There's no doubt that SAF, in the form of e-fuels, will play an important role in the medium and long term, in 
particular for medium and long haul... [but] I do not believe it's an important part of how you're decarbonising short-
haul aviation in the medium and long term," Lundgren commented.
European LCCs sceptical of SAF solution
He points out the distinction between e-fuels, which comprise power-to-liquid fuels, and biofuels, which use 
feedstock. He argues the latter is not sustainable long-term and warns the industry not to focus all of its 
attention into this solution.
"My concern around SAF is if there's a huge amount of effort and resources to set up capacity and supply for 
biofuel, which is not going to be an effective long-term solution for aviation, we have to make sure that doesn't 
remove the resources we need to set up e-fuels that are also going to be needed."
Lundgren says the debate has shifted over the past decade from "whether" zero-emissions aircraft will happen to 
"when" it will happen.
"We don't have the luxury to rule out any technology, and we know that hydrogen and electric can play a part."
Wizz Air's CEO Jozsef Varadi agrees investment in new generation technology on the market today is the main way 
forward, highlighting its most recent top-up order for 102 A321neos and 27 A321XLRs at the Dubai air show.
"You have to innovate with what you have or you don't innovate. We have decided to innovate with the technology 
that is available to the industry," commented Varadi, adding "At the moment we have a fleet with an average age of 
five years. That's going to come down to three years in the next five years given the delivery streams in front of us. 
You need to spend the money on new technology to make this industry greener."
He says there is still a question mark around how SAF can be implemented and the cost involved to create enough 
supply.
"We still have to define the economics and materials required for SAF... we may fall into also sorts of traps and 
issues going forward in that regard. This is only a bridging solution between where we are today and where we 
need to be in a few decades time."
Varadi also argues there needs to be more scrutiny on sustainability across the whole aviation supply chain.
"If you really look at the value chain, we are dealing with manufacturers that are the ones that bring you the 
technology. We are dealing with ATC which governs the operation of the industry in Europe. You look at the fuel 
suppliers who are the ones who need to come up with a solution for sustainable aviation fuel.
"We are the least responsible for sustainability across the whole value chain. Everyone is looking at the airlines but 
everyone across the value chain needs to play a part and take responsibility."
Speaking during Airfinance Journal's podcast 'Will the industry transition from red to black to green?', Split Rock 
Aviation partner Andy Mansell said strong leadership is needed to create an ESG strategy that is achievable today.
"The stakeholders in the space tend to talk about what other people should be doing, whereas everyone should be 
talking about what they can do.
"We've seen what happens when there isn't a firm voice representing the airline industry... It's time for IATA to lay 
out the path and to represent the airlines about what they can achieve," added Mansell.

Air Asia Group has chartered in its first dedicated freighter, a Boeing 737-800BCF operated by Thailand's K-Mile 
Air, for its Teleport cargo operation.
The 2001-vintage 737-800 is currently owned by JP Lease Products & Services, Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker 
shows.
JP Lease leased the freighter to K-Mile Air in October 2021.
Before passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion, the aircraft was operated by Ryanair, Garuda Indonesia and 
Aeromexico.
"The addition of the freighter into our fleet will accelerate the company's goal to shift from a pure air freight logistics 
provider to a complete multi-modal operator. We've always been on a fast track growth route to continuously propel 
Teleport's air cargo business forward by spotlighting our commitment towards moving anything across Southeast 
Asia," Teleport chief executive Pete Chareonwongsak said.
The freighter will operate to destinations including Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Hong Kong, Nagoya and Singapore.

 Ryanair[1] benefitted from a strong Q2 to record a €225 million profit compared to a €225.5 million loss last year. 
However, its half-year result produced a €47.6 million loss. The airline's results remain under pressure as yields are 
low and the low-cost carrier needs to offer tickets at reduced prices to stimulate demand. This trend makes that 
Ryanair is up for a challenging winter season. 
 Besides the Q2 €225 million net profit, the operating profit was €254 million versus just €10.8 million for the June-
September quarter last year. Total revenues were €1.784 billion, with ancillary revenues again performing strongly 
from €360.9 million last year to €703 million this Q3. 
 On the back of a weak Q1 with a net loss of €243 million[2], Ryanair produced a net loss between April and 
September of €47.6 million. This compares to €-410.5 million in 2020. The operating loss for HY1 was €50.5 million 
compared to €-176.8 million. Revenues ended at €2.154 billion versus €1.176 billion. 
 Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the first six months of its financial year 2022, compared to 17.1 million in 
the same period last year. Q1 was impacted by travel restrictions and, as a result, many cancelations around 
Easter. Q2 was much better as demand increased and traveling became easier thanks to the Digital Covid 
Certificate in July. But as in Q1, bookings remained close-in and Ryanair needed price stimulation with reduced 
fares to stimulate demand. Load factors were on average 79 percent in HY1 but consistently over eighty percent 
from July onwards. 
Demand needs further price stimulation 
While October and Christmas bookings are strong, Michael O'Leary said that the visibility of the winter 2022 season 
remains low. Yields and ticket prices continue to be challenging. Another factor is rising fuel prices. Ryanair has 
hedged only seventy percent of fuel in HY2 and eighty percent for HY1 FY23. With the uncertainties of the Covid-
crisis in mind when it had to ground its fleet against huge hedging losses, Ryanair didn't want to hedge at 90-95 
percent anymore. Instead, it is preferring fuel swaps and modest use of caps. These caps are for $62-72 per barrel, 
well below the current $80. However, this could pose a risk if fuel prices remain high next year. 
 Ryanair is expecting to end FY22 with a low 100 million in passengers carried, up from its previous guidance of 90-
100 million but lower than the 80-120 million that was announced earlier this year. The net loss should be 'a modest 
€100 to €200 million' but only if the roll-out of vaccinations continues and no new Covid-cases emerge. 
Ryanair up for challenging winter season
 'We work hard to rebuild load factors. In fact, we are already well over eighty percent and see ourselves back at 
over ninety percent in the summer of 2022. But outside of these peak periods like November, the second half of 
January, the first half of February, yields will be tough. We will be engaging a lot of price discounting to get people 
back moving and restore confidence into the intra-EU air travel', O'Leary said. 
 During HY1, Ryanair announced over 560 new routes as part of the 2.400 routes offered and opened fourteen new 
bases. The carrier agreed on new base deals with eleven airports and signed long-term extensions with five 
airports, including London Stansted, Manchester, East Midlands, Charleroi (Belgium), and Bergamo (Italy). For 
summer 2022, the carrier will open new bases in Cork, Newcastle, Venice, and Vienna. At the Austrian capital, 
Ryanair will base eleven aircraft 'as both Wizz Air and Austrian are in retreat.' The strengthening of Vienna fills the 
void left after plans to build Vienna into a strong hub for its subsidiary Lauda collapsed in 2019. 
 Italy will also become even more important, with 21 extra aircraft based at seven airports in the country 'to ensure 
that airfares to and from Italy remain low, even as Alitalia (ITA Airways) has its capacity.' Ryanair will also add more 
capacity to Portugal, Poland, and Ireland, its home country being stimulated by demand and lower airport charges. 
Ukraine is set to become an important market next year.

At its recent annual general meeting, Ryanair adopted a revised strategy that targets aggressive growth for the next 
five years. Instead of going for 200 million passengers in March 2026, it has now upped its game to get to 225 
million passengers. This compares to 149 million in 2019. Ryanair sees an opportunity for this extra growth as other 
carriers have planned a reduction in capacity while various countries like Ireland, Italy, and Morocco are stimulating 
tourism to restore traffic. To cater to this demand, the carrier will hire 5.000 employees over the next five years to 
staff its rapidly growing fleet. 
 Ryanair will take delivery of 210 Boeing[3] MAX 8200s through 2026. It has now eight in service and expects to 
grow this number to 65 by next summer. Although load factors are not high enough to benefit from the four percent 
higher seat capacity of the 8200 over the 737-800, O'Leary is satisfied with the reliability, fuel consumption, and 
customer feedback of the MAX. The airline sold ten 737-800s of the oldest in Q2, with eight of them to be retired by 
the summer of next year. 
'Boeing needs to come back to the table' 
On thefailed negotiations[4] on a MAX 10 order after Boeing raised aircraft prices, O'Leary said that 'Boeing needs 
to come back to the table. They need an order from Ryanair. But frankly, we have enough aircraft for the next four 
to five years. We will wait until Boeing gets competitive on pricing again before we place another order. () Boeing is 
losing customers all over the place and the one large customer they have outside North America, Ryanair, was very 
close in active negotiations for the MAX 10. But Boeing walked away from discussions. They were looking for a 
price increase at a time when prices should be falling if Boeing is to recover its production.' He referred to Jet2's 
decision to opt for the Airbus[5] A320neo for the same reason and also mentioned IAG, which according to O'Leary 
has walked away from an order for 200 MAX (announced at the 2019 Paris Airshow as a Letter of Intent) in favor of 
Airbus. 
 Ryanair ended September with €4.24 billion in cash. Adding assets of €7.6 billion of its ninety percent 
unencumbered fleet makes €14.07 billion in total. The carrier issued a €1.2 billion unsecured bond in May while 
repaying an €860 million 2014 loan in June and a 600 million 'Covid loan' to the UK in late October. The net debt 
stood at €1.5 billion. Capital expenditure for FY22 will be around €1.2 billion including maintenance and €2.3 billion 
in FY23. It will finance its existing MAX order from its balance sheet and high credit rating but likely also by issuing 
new bonds, doing sales and leasebacks, and through so-called Jolco financing deals.

RYANAIR has announced it will start refunding customers of cancelled flights within five working days.
Part of a company campaign to improve its image, the measure was set after the Dublin-based carrier held its first 
customer panel meeting in September, when customers all over Europe met with senior management to provide 
recommendations on customer service.
"We are pleased to launch these innovative customer improvements which will enhance the travel experience of our 
guests," said Ryanair's marketing director Dara Brady.
"Driven by customer panel input, these improvements allow our guests to self-serve online when changing flight 
dates or passengers' names, updating contact info or adding bags/seats. For customers who need extra assistance 
they can now track their interactions with Ryanair across calls, email, chat, social and receive live status updates 
online."
When the Covid-19 pandemic struck Europe and air travel was effectively banned, Ryanair was one of the few 
airlines who decided not to refund passengers that could not travel because of Covid-19 restrictions.
The move attracted a lot of criticism and caused the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to open an 
investigation into the company's practices in June 2021, City A.M.
reported.

Slot allocation at capacity-constrained airports is a source of constant discord.
This month, low-cost Irish airline Ryanair fulminated against what it claimed was anti-competitive "slot blocking" in 
Lisbon by Portugal's flag carrier, TAP. Incumbents have gripes too. They are feeling the pinch from the EU's use-
them-or-lose-them rules.
The usual requirement that airlines fly 80 per cent of the time in order to retain their landing slots was relaxed in the 
pandemic. Now the EU is demanding airlines use at least half of all slots held for the winter season. That is a tough 
ask given industry predictions of international flights running at a third of 2019 levels.
One option is to send empty planes up in the air. These are perverse incentives. Burn cash and dump emissions 
and, in return, keep hold of valuable slots at busy airports.
Dissent over the administrative system of slot allocation is growing. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority 
chafes at the grandfathering nature of allocation, which makes it hard for newcomers to acquire slots at the busiest 
airports.
In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration sought to auction slots at New York airports before its plans were 
kiboshed by the courts in 2009. China experimented with both an auction (Guangzhou) and a lottery (Shanghai) 
almost a decade later.
Slots are, in effect, free - though airlines invest in accompanying infrastructure and marketing services.
Airlines: slot machine Twitter : @FTLex
But a secondary market gives a glimpse of their inherent value. Air New Zealand last year sold its slot at London 
Heathrow for $27m. Kenya Airways sold a pair of slots at the same airport to Oman Air in 2016 for a reported $75m.
Industry body Iata argues that the global, connected nature of flights rules out alternative means of allocation.
But it is worth persevering. Auctions work in other areas, like spectrum allocation. At the very least, they beat 
sending ghost planes up in the air.

Ryanair vows 5-day refund turnaround after COVID criticism

Ryanair (RYA.I) on Thursday vowed to repay customers within five days for cancelled flights in a renewed customer 
service push after criticism about how it handled refunds at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The budget airline, Europe's largest, said refunds would be processed into a new online wallet function within 24 
hours of a flight being cancelled, allowing customers to book new flights immediately or opt to get the funds back 
within five working days.
Ryanair was one of a number of airlines criticised during the pandemic for resisting issuing cash refunds to people 
who could not take their flights due to COVID-19 restrictions, which the airlines said were outside of their control.
Some customers also complained of delays to refunds for cancelled flights and unwieldy refund request processes.
Britain's competition authority in June launched enforcement action against Ryanair over a failure to offer refunds 
rather than rebooking to passengers who were barred from taking flights under lockdown rules. But earlier this 
month it withdrew the action.
Ryanair said it had paid refunds in justified cases after reviewing each case.
In September Ryanair joined a group of European airlines in agreeing to refund passengers whose flights were 
cancelled during the pandemic, and committed to provide better information on passengers' rights in future.
Ryanair said it was making a fresh customer service push to build on its 2014 'Always Getting Better' campaign 
when Chief Executive Michael O'Leary vowed to stop doing things that "unnecessarily piss people off".
A new feature of its app promised real time push notifications and videos from its operations centre to inform 
customers of their flight status and any disruptions.
It also said customers would be able to makes changes to flights or passengers' names via the app rather than 
calling a customer service agent.

Some airlines risk failure if they do not cut emissions faster
Some airlines risk failure if they do not cut emissions faster

Some airlines risk failure if they do not cut carbon emissions quicker in the next three to five years due to a 
mismatch between short-term corporate travel targets and the airline industry's 2050 net zero target, an industry 
report said.
Airlines are also at a rising risk of shareholder activism at a time when major fund managers such as BlackRock Inc 
(BLK.N), Vanguard Group Inc and State Street Corp (STT.N) have publicly expressed concerns about climate 
change, the report from CAPA Centre for Aviation and Envest Global released on Wednesday said.
"The pressure from customers and governments and investors is going to probably demand an acceleration of the 
journey to net zero, which is clearly going to put pressure on airlines," said David Wills, advisory executive director 
at Australian carbon reduction strategy firm Envest.
"The conditions are right for airlines who get it wrong to find themselves in a potential failure situation," he added.
Several companies, such as HSBC Holdings plc (HSBA.L), Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (ZURN.S), Bain & 
Company and S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N), have already announced plans to quickly cut business travel emissions by 
as much as 70%. read more
Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) Chief Executive Alan Joyce said last week that his airline was developing a 2030 
emissions target. read more
"Our view is that smart airlines will pivot to reinforcing not only 2050 but enhancing their definitive views on 2030, 
because they will be looking to engage with their corporate customers more," said Brett Mitsch, Envest's executive 
director of investment.
The CAPA/Envest report found the top quartile of 52 global airlines examined emitted an average of 30% less per 
passenger kilometre flown in 2019 than those in the bottom quartile.
Low-cost carriers like Wizz Air (WIZZ.L), Ryanair (RYA.I) and AirAsia (AIRA.KL) with newer fleets and higher load 
factors were among the best performers, while the worst included Turkish Airlines, Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) 
(9201.T) and British Airways.
Some airlines risk failure if they do not cut emissions faster
JAL said it was introducing more fuel efficient planes and looking to secure more sustainable aviation fuel to meet a 
target of lowering absolute emissions by at least 10% from its 2019 levels by 2030.
The CAPA/Envest report said JAL was able to break even with a carbon price of more than $160 per tonne based 
on 2019 earnings, whereas many airlines with lower profit margins would have reported a loss at a carbon price of 
$30 per tonne.

Commercial flights that fly 'entirely on hydrogen' planned for 2024
Commercial flights that fly 'entirely on hydrogen' planned for 2024

Plans to operate commercial hydrogen-electric flights between London and Rotterdam have been announced, with 
those behind the project hoping it will take to the skies in 2024.
In a statement Wednesday, aviation firm ZeroAvia said it was developing a 19-seater aircraft that would "fly entirely 
on hydrogen."
A partnership between ZeroAvia, airport company Royal Schiphol Group, Rotterdam The Hague Innovation Airport 
Foundation and Rotterdam the Hague Airport has been established to work on the initiative.
"The deal sets a solid timeline for the launch of the first zero emission commercial passenger flights between the 
UK and the Netherlands, and potentially the first international commercial operation in the world," ZeroAvia said.
The company added that both itself and Royal Schiphol Group were in what it described as "advanced partnership 
talks with airlines to agree on an operator for the planned route."
According to the International Energy Agency, carbon dioxide emissions from aviation "have risen rapidly over the 
past two decades," hitting almost 1 metric gigaton in 2019. This, it notes, equates to "about 2.8% of global CO2 
emissions from fossil fuel combustion."
Elsewhere, the World Wildlife Fund describes aviation as "one of the fastest-growing sources of the greenhouse 
gas emissions driving global climate change." It adds that air travel is the most carbon-intensive activity an 
individual can do.
ZeroAvia's research and development is centered around powering electric motors utilizing hydrogen fuel cells. In 
September 2020, a six-seater hydrogen fuel cell plane from the company completed its maiden flight.
The same month also saw Airbus release details of three hydrogen-fueled concept planes, with the European 
aerospace giant claiming they could enter service by the year 2035.
While there is excitement in some quarters about the potential of hydrogen-powered flight, the aviation sector faces 
a number of challenges when it comes to reducing its environmental footprint.
Commercial flights that fly 'entirely on hydrogen' planned for 2024
In an interview during CNBC's Sustainable Future Forum last week, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary was cautious 
when it came to the outlook for new and emerging technologies in the sector.
"I think ... we should be honest again," he said. "Certainly, for the next decade ... I don't think you're going to see 
any - there's no technology out there that's going to replace ... carbon, jet aviation."
"I don't see the arrival of ... hydrogen fuels, I don't see the arrival of sustainable fuels, I don't see the arrival of 
electric propulsion systems, certainly not before 2030," he continued.
"So it will certainly be after my career in the airline industry is finished ... but I hope it will get here before the end of 
our mortal lives."

Menzies Aviation, the global aviation logistics specialist, today announces it is providing Ryanair with fully electric 
turnarounds at three airports in Europe. These turns reinforce Menzies' and Ryanair's commitment to reducing the 
carbon footprint of their operations.
Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport and Oslo Airport are the first locations in Europe where 
Menzies has the capability to provide fully electric green turns. The turns have been made possible through the 
airports' provision of charging infrastructure necessary for electric equipment.
A signatory of the UN Global Compact, Menzies has an industry leading sustainability strategy, which includes 
becoming carbon neutral by 2033 - the company's 200th anniversary. A key component of this goal is Menzies' 
commitment to evolving its ground services equipment (GSE) fleet to become fully electric where possible, which 
will be achieved through the replacement of combustion engines with electric motors.
Katy Reid, Head of Sustainability & Corporate Responsibility, Menzies, said: "We recognise the aviation industry's 
role in addressing the climate emergency and we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and becoming 
carbon neutral, for scope one and two emissions, by 2033. We are taking action by switching to electric GSE where 
possible and ongoing collaboration with partners such as Ryanair will be vital to achieving this ambition. We look 
forward to working closely with industry partners, including suppliers, airlines and airports, to advance more 
environmentally friendly operations."
Thomas Fowler, Director of Sustainability and Finance, Ryanair, added: "At Ryanair we have committed to 
achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reducing CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 10% by 2030. 
That is why we have invested $22bn in new aircraft that will help us reduce our fuel consumption by approx. 16% 
on a per-seat basis. We can now offer zero emissions turnarounds at 11 locations, including Amsterdam, 
Gothenburg and Oslo, when previously, a standard turnaround could emit up to 52.43kg of CO2. Our partnerships 
with industry leaders such as Menzies Aviation are vital to us in achieving our goal of being net carbon neutral by 
2050."

On The Beach reports strong position despite 'suppressed trading'

(Alliance News) - On The Beach Group PLC on Wednesday reported "suppressed trading" in the second half of its 
financial year, but the holiday retailer maintained that it remains in a strong position as it heads into the typically 
busiest booking period for travel.
During the six months that ended September 30, On The Beach said it had experienced difficult trading but 
remained well-placed to take advantage of market opportunities when demand for booking holidays returns. While 
demand for international leisure travel currently remains below pre-pandemic levels, the company highlighted that 
its specific initiatives, including its 'free Covid tests' promotion, combined with a further softening of government 
restrictions, have stimulated bookings in the final weeks of the financial year. 
Going forward, On The Beach said it remains committed to investing for long-term market share gains in its current 
financial year, ahead of full market recovery. 
"The strategic initiatives we have taken throughout the year to best navigate the crisis and manage risk while 
investing in our brand, people and technology, ensure On the Beach is in a strong position as we head into our 
typically busiest booking period," said Chief Executive Simon Cooper.
On The Beach restarted selling holidays to travel from early September 2021, when it became clearer that overall 
confidence to book holidays had increased.
Last Friday, the Financial Times reported that legal documents filed with the High Court showed On the Beach was 
suing Ryanair Holdings PLC for blocking the travel agent from booking flights with the Irish low-cost carrier. On the 
Beach also claimed that Ryanair had abused its "dominant" position in the market and made "false and disparaging 
claims".
On The Beach made no comment on the report in its trading statement on Wednesday.

No public support for France 's short-haul ban says Ryanair 's boss

RYANAIR's boss Michael O'Leary has said French President Emmanuel Macron is lying when he says there is 
public support for the French Government's ban on short-haul flights, the Telegraph reported.
"Be very careful with the French," the paper reported him saying.
"You can always tell when the French are lying because their lips are moving."
O'Leary's fiery comments come in response to France announcing a ban on domestic short-haul flights.
To cut down on CO2 emissions, the French Government is replacing flights with train journeys if they can be done 
in under two and a half hours. According to O'Leary, the Elysee's decision will have an impact on short-haul carriers 
while leave long-haul ones - including French national carrier Air France - intact.
"France is banning all domestic flights that are under 500 km - unless it is travelling on to a connecting flight through 
Paris Charles de Gaulle. So basically Air France will keep on flying, but everyone else will be banned," he added. 
France is not the first European country to implement a ban on short-haul flights. Austria set the same rule in 
November 2020, replacing all flights between Vienna and Graz with a three-hour train journey. According to an April 
Twitter poll made by Martin Lewis, 79.1 per cent of UK people would be in favour of adopting the strategy.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) is facing a lawsuit from British travel retailer On the Beach claiming that the airline 
blocked it from booking flights, The Irish Times reported Oct. 22, citing legal documents filed with the UK high court.
On the Beach said that the budget airline broke competition rules and abused its dominant position in the market by 
blocking its credit cards and stopping its customers from managing bookings online. On the Beach also added that 
it paid about 48.7 million pounds sterling ($67.1 million) in refunds.

O'Leary also accused France's President Emmanuel Macron of lying about the public's support for the ban. 
The CEO also dismissed a campaign against air travel because of carbon emissions, adding that "flight-shaming 
has no traction whatsoever."

chapters,and teaching materials,making it the premier go-to resource for business students.￿For the last six years, 
TCC has been compiling a list ofitsTop 40best-sellingcase authors, which expanded this year torankthe top 50[7]. 
The appearance of six IMD faculty on TCC's list is a testimony to the caliberof the institution's teaching 
research,withKashani, Killing,andLeleuxhavingbeen on the list sinceit was first published in 2016. 
AmongKashani'sbest-selling cases wasReinventing Nespresso? The Challenges of a Market Leader Under

Nespresso, facing declining growth and market share loss, took on new competitors to sustain its success.

an economic crisis in Russia. 
Meehan wrote a case series onRyanair Strategic Positioning[10]. The airline had grown to become Europe's largest 
by 2013 but was often unloved,with many believing the company had pushed costs lower at the expense of service. 
The case series weighs up Ryanair's change program,'ALWAYS GETTING BETTER',whichwas designed to turn 
Ryanair into the'Amazon of Travel in Europe.' 
Peter Killing is known for histhree-part case series[11]￿on Nestl's￿Globe Program, which examineshow Chris

Completing the line-up is Stefan Michel,who published a case in January entitledIs Netflix Building a House of 
Cards?[12],which explores whether Netflix's binge-spending on content to fend off competition from new streaming 
competitors is a sustainable strategy.

Online travel agent On the Beach is suing Ryanair for blocking it from booking flights with the airline, in an 
escalation of a long-running dispute between the travel groups.
According to legal documents filed with the High Court, On the Beach claims that Ryanair breached competition 
rules by blocking its credit cards and preventing its customers from managing bookings online.
On the Beach claims that Ryanair abused its "dominant" position in the market and caused it loss by unlawful 
means. The travel agent claims that Ryanair stops it from creating a "my Ryanair account" required to make a 
booking and has made false and disparaging claims about the company.
Ryanair has long tussled with online travel agents, which prevent the airline from dealing directly with customers.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary has characterised online agents as "overcharging scam artists" for adding their 
own fees to the airline's price. Ryanair has previously complained that travel agents have provided incorrect 
passenger information to the airline.
Airlines prefer to deal with customers directly, particularly as it allows them to sell extra products, from seat 
selection to car rentals and hotel bookings. These so-called ancillaries are crucial to Ryanair's low-cost business 
model. The airline pioneered the use of them in Europe to keep headline fares low.
Travel agent sues Ryanair over bookings spat Airlines
On the Beach is seeking damages from the airline and claims that Ryanair sought to "degrade the experience for 
On the Beach customers by making it less convenient and/or more expensive for ... customers to use Ryanair than 
for direct customers".
Ryanair, which is yet to file a defence to the allegations, declined to comment.
On the Beach claims that since December last year, Ryanair has refused to allow its customers to manage their 
bookings or check in online, requiring them to do so in person. In some cases, customers were allegedly charged 
an extra (EURO)55 for in-person check-ins.
The case follows a spat over refunds for cancelled flights during the pandemic. Last year, Ryanair accused several 
online booking companies of failing to pass refunds on to customers after flights were cancelled during travel 
restrictions last spring. In turn, On the Beach claims package travel rules forced it to refund customers for cancelled 
flights that Ryanair did not refund.

Ryanair CEO O'Leary warns that sustainable jet fuel targets could push food prices higher
Ryanair CEO O'Leary warns that sustainable jet fuel targets could push food

The CEO of Ryanair has acknowledged the need for ambitious sustainable aviation fuel targets while also 
expressing concerns about how food prices could be affected.
During a discussion at CNBC's Sustainable Future Forum on Wednesday, Michael O'Leary said his firm was 
investing "a lot of money" with Trinity College Dublin on research into sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. In April, the 
two organizations launched a sustainable aviation research center backed by a 1.5 million euro ($1.75 million) 
donation from the airline.
As well as focusing on SAF, the center will look at noise mapping and zero-carbon propulsion systems for aircraft.
Ryanair has itself set a target of powering 12.5% of its flights with SAF by the year 2030. But speaking to CNBC's 
Steve Sedgwick, O'Leary said he thought it was "a very ambitious target - I'm not sure we'll get there."
He went on to articulate his feelings about the wider effects of increasing SAF usage. "I do worry over the longer 
term, though, on sustainable aviation fuels ... what's that going to do to food prices going forward?"
"I think we're going to reach a point in the next 10 or 20 years where there will be challenges posed not just for the 
airline industry, but for industry in general, around sustainable aviation fuels where it may have an upward impact 
on food prices."
Although the European Union Aviation Safety Agency says there's "not a single internationally agreed definition" of 
sustainable aviation fuel, the overarching idea is that it can be used to reduce an aircraft's emissions.
Aircraft-maker Airbus describes sustainable aviation fuels as being "made from renewable raw material," for 
example, "crops based or used cooking oil and animal fat."
Despite his concerns, O'Leary said he was certain that ambitious targets needed to be put in place.
"The European Union has set a target of 5% of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030," he said. "We think we can do 
better than that - I think we'll get to 10%."
Ryanair CEO O'Leary warns that sustainable jet fuel targets could push food prices higher
"Whether we can get to 12 and a half percent, I'm not sure, but I know if we don't invest in the research and that 
technology now, we certainly won't get there."
Huge challenges
According to the International Energy Agency, carbon dioxide emissions from aviation "have risen rapidly over the 
past two decades," hitting almost 1 metric gigaton in 2019. This, it notes, equates to "about 2.8% of global CO2 
emissions from fossil fuel combustion."
Elsewhere, the World Wildlife Fund describes aviation as "one of the fastest-growing sources of the greenhouse 
gas emissions driving global climate change." It adds that air travel is the most carbon intensive activity an 
individual can do.
As concerns about sustainability and the environment mount, discussions about aviation have increasingly focused 
on how new innovations and ideas could reduce the sector's environmental footprint.
In September 2020, for instance, a hydrogen fuel-cell plane capable of carrying passengers took to the skies over 
England for its maiden flight.
The same month also saw Airbus release details of three hydrogen-fueled concept planes, with the European 
aerospace giant claiming they could enter service by the year 2035.
O'Leary was cautious when it came to the outlook for new and emerging technologies in the sector.
"I think ... we should be honest again," he said. "Certainly, for the next decade ... I don't think you're going to see 
any - there's no technology out there that's going to replace ... carbon, jet aviation."
"I don't see the arrival of ... hydrogen fuels, I don't see the arrival of sustainable fuels, I don't see the arrival of 
electric propulsion systems, certainly not before 2030," he went on to say.
"So it will certainly be after my career in the airline industry is finished ... but I hope it will get here before the end of 
our mortal lives."

 Ryanair (RY4C.IR, RYA.L) may not reach its target of using sustainable aviation fuels in 12.5% of its flights by 
2030, but is confident of surpassing the European Union target of 5%, CNBC reported Thursday, citing airline Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary.
Calling the 12.5% target "very ambitious," O'Leary said that the company can reach 10%, and that the bloc should 
also raise its target for 2030 to 10%. 
Shares of the low cost airline fell flat on Thursday afternoon.

Frankfurt Hahn operator declares insolvency

Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH, the operator of Frankfurt Hahn airport, has filed for insolvency at the Bad 
Kreuznach district court, but has since vowed to continue operating for the time being.
Provisional insolvency administrator Markus Plathner told the German news agency dpa that all of the airports' 
employees would continue to receive wages through insolvency protection funds. The airport will also continue to 
service passenger and cargo traffic as planned while the administrators investigate its financial situation and draw 
up a business plan for the future.
The insolvency filing also includes four subsidiary companies: JFH Jet Fuel Hahn GmbH, HNA Airport Services 
GmbH, HHN Airport Technology GmbH and HHN Aviation Security GmbH.
The airport is 82.5%-owned by China's HNA Group. The conglomerate acquired the stake from the government of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, the state in which the airport is located, during a global spending spree in 2017. The 
remaining 17.5% stake is owned by the government of neighbouring Hesse, in which Frankfurt is located. Although 
Hahn has branded itself as a secondary airport serving Germany's financial centre, it is located around 100 
kilometres from Frankfurt Int'l (and a similar distance from Cologne/Bonn and Luxembourg).
The Chinese investor had planned to expand Hahn into a large cargo hub based on its lack of night curfew and a 
surplus in spare capacity. While it has secured some cargo traffic, including from other HNA Group carriers and 
partially in response to a slot shortage at other airports including Amsterdam Schiphol, Hahn remains a 
predominantly low-cost carrier airport. According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Ryanair and Wizz Air operate 
62 and 17 weekly scheduled departure out of Hahn, respectively. The only other passenger carriers serving the 
airport are Air Serbia and FlyOne. Malta Air, a subsidiary of Ryanair, has a crew base at the airport.
The airport is partially subsidised by Rheinland-Palatinate (which does not have any other sizeable commercial 
airport) and had expected to become profitable by 2024.
Hahn used to be an American military airport during the partition of Germany but was converted into a passenger 
facility in 1999. It no longer hosts any Luftwaffe or United States Air Force units, although it is used for the military 
charters. In 2018, the last full year for which its annual report is available, the airport operator lost EUR4.6 million 
euros (USD5.4 million).

Highlight: Frankfurt Hahn Airport (HHN), an international budget flights hub in Germany, has filed for bankruptcy at 
the Bad Kreuznach Administrative Court.
Body
It is still unclear how the bankruptcy would impact flight operations at the airport. The court has appointed Jan 
Markus Plathner as the provisional administrator for the bankruptcy proceedings. 
China-based HNA Group holds an 82.5% stake in the airport while the remaining stake is owned by the German 
state of Hesse. In 2017, HNA Group acquired a stake from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate for $17.5m 
((EURO)15m). In February, a court in China initiated bankruptcy proceedings against HNA following requests from 
its creditors. However, China's Liaoning Fangda Group and Hainan Development Holdings stated that they could 
clear the debt owed to retail investors by HNA. Furthermore, HNA Group chairman Chen Feng and CEO Tan 
Xiangdong were detained by Hainan provincial police for alleged criminal offences in September. The airport started 
witnessing a plunge in passenger business way before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the global aviation industry. 
Originally, the airport served as an important hub for budget carrier Ryanair. However, it suffered a huge dent in its 
earnings after the discount airline started shifting to nearby larger airports. Government subsidies were granted to 
keep the airport solvent as its debt had piled up. Frankfurt Hahn Airport handled approximately 1.5 million 
passengers in 2019. Last month, Germany's Cologne Bonn Airport (CGN) renewed its IT infrastructure. Software 
firm PSI Logistics helped the airport in its IT infrastructure renewal. Software and control computers, as well as 
monitoring and display systems in baggage handling, were also upgraded.

Brussels set to extend state aid relaxation; Pandemic spending

Brussels is seeking to extend its relaxation of state aid rules beyond the end of the year as it comes under pressure 
from businesses to keep the temporary measures introduced to help them survive the pandemic.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition chief, said the bloc was looking to extend the relaxation deadline, 
"hopefully" just one last time, but that arrangements for certain industries would remain after special exemptions 
were phased out.
Her comments come as some governments across the EU try to extricate themselves from costly support schemes 
used to prop up businesses struggling in the face of Covid-19 lockdowns and other restrictions.
Speaking to the Financial Times, Vestager said: "We want to present what we are doing with hopefully the last 
version of the temporary state aid framework." She said future state aid would target industries particularly badly hit 
by the pandemic, such as airlines and the hospitality sector. But she warned that, rather than "pouring in" taxpayers' 
money, the bloc needed to use "a little bit of taxpayers' money to incentivise private investment".
Last June, the European Commission approved a (EURO)9bn bailout to help
Lufthansa, Germany's largest airline, survive a dramatic drop in demand.
The extraordinary state aid measures needed to be tapered gradually, she said, while businesses grappled with a 
drop in demand.
Brussels set to extend state aid relaxation; Pandemic spending
She added some of the new features, such as enabling small and mediumsized businesses to access private 
funding instead of a bank loan, might be given a longer life, "because we consider them to be pro-innovation, 
procompetitive". Since the pandemic, Brussels has granted exceptional aid in more than 650 cases, totalling 
(EURO)3.09tn. But so far only a quarter of that amount has been spent because companies in some countries have 
not needed to use all the funds available.
However, the commission has also faced criticism that support from the state is distorting competition across the 
EU.
Ryanair has filed legal complaints against the commission's approval of state aid for airlines, including Germany's 
Condor and Austrian Airlines. Some member states, including the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland, are opposed 
to the extension, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the matter.
An official announcement of the extension is expected in the next few weeks, according to two people with direct 
knowledge of the matter.

German airport Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH files for insolvency
German airport Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH files for insolvency

Body
Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH, the company which operates an airport some 100 kilometres west of Frankfurt, has filed for 
insolvency, operations manager Christoph Goetzmann told dpa on Tuesday.
Hahn Airport is 82.5-per-cent owned by the Chinese conglomerate HNA. The company acquired the shares from 
the state of Rhineland-Palatinate - where the airport is located - in 2017 for around 15 million euros (17.5 million 
dollars). The remaining 17.5 per cent is held by the state of Hesse.
Most recently, the arrest of the top management of the financially troubled HNA Group caused a stir.
At the time, the airport company emphasized that this would have no effect on Frankfurt-Hahn. The airport was on a 
good course, it said at the beginning of October.
The airport, which was once a US military airport and subsequently a hub for budget carrier Ryanair, has benefited 
from a boom in airfreight resulting from online purchases and bottlenecks in sea freight.
However, even before the coronavirus pandemic hit, passenger traffic had declined from highs of around 4 million a 
year. Dublin-based Ryanair has cut its flights and shifted traffic to larger airports in the region.
In its report for 2020, the airport management acknowledged it would not be making a profit, but predicted that it 
could go into the black by 2024.
Earlier this year, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) threw out an application from Lufthansa targeting the state 
aid that Frankfurt-Hahn had received. The legal action turned on subsidies paid since 1997 and contracts with 
Ryanair on airport fees.

Tuesday's insolvency application was filed with the district court in the town of Bad Kreuznach, with the court 
appointing Frankfurt lawyer Jan Markus Plathner as provisional insolvency administrator.

The competition regulator has launched legal action against the owner of Teletext Holidays, its first court 
proceedings to force a travel company to refund customers whose getaways were cancelled during the pandemic. 
The Competition and Markets Authority said yesterday that it had started proceedings to obtain a court order that 
would compel Truly Holdings, Teletext Holidays' parent company, to repay customers still waiting for refunds.
It is its first Covid-19 refunds case to reach the courts and comes after the CMA abandoned an investigation into 
pandemic-linked refunds at the airlines Ryanair and British Airways in October.
"Companies must abide by consumer protection law and treat their customers fairly," said Andrea Coscelli, CMA 
Chief executive. "After engaging with Teletext Holidays extensively, we are now requesting a court order to make 
sure that the company immediately pays back the money it still owes to customers and refunds people within 14 
days, going forward."
Teletext said: "The company is working as hard as it can and continues to process the remaining refunds due under 
the package travel regulations to our remaining customers, and as such is very disappointed by the latest action by 
the CMA."
Truly Holdings and its sister company, travel operator www.Alpharooms.com, signed undertakings in May to refund 
customers whose package breaks were cancelled during the pandemic. Truly agreed to take all reasonable 
Regulator takes legal action to force Covid refunds for tourists; Travel & leisure
measures to ensure eligible customers were paid back by the end of August at the latest. The company also agreed 
to refund new customers within 14 days of holidays being cancelled, as package holiday rules demand.
But in September the CMA said many customers were still waiting to be refunded. The regulator said Truly also 
appeared to be breaking the law by failing to swiftly refund new customers whose holidays were cancelled, adding 
that it would take court action unless it rectified the issue.
Truly said yesterday that it had already paid out £10.8m in refunds as of October 11 and owed £1.2m more to 
customers.
The regulator does not have the power to fine companies directly for breaches of consumer law and must instead 
go through the courts to force them to comply with regulations.
The threat of legal action has proved effective at wresting refunds from package holiday companies in recent 
months.
But the CMA has come up against barriers concerning airline refunds, where the law is less straightforward. In 
October, the CMA dropped an investigation into refunds for Ryanair and British Airways customers who were 
prevented from flying because of Covid-19 travel restrictions, saying the law was insufficiently clear to warrant a 
court case.

 The former military airstrip turned commercial airport maintains a busy freight business, but it has been losing 
passengers since before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, located 120 kilometers (75 
miles) northwest of Frankfurt in the Hunsrück region of the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, filed for 
bankruptcy Tuesday. 
What do we know so far? 
According to Operating Manager Christoph Goetzmann, papers were filed at the Bad Kreuznach Administrative 
Court. The court has appointed Frankfurter lawyer Jan Markus Plathner provisional administrator while the 
company is in receivership. 
The airport's biggest investor, the Chinese HNA Group, purchased 82.5% of the business from the state of 
Rhineland-Palatinate for €15 million ($17.5 million) in 2017. The remaining 17.5% belongs to the neighboring 
western German state of Hesse. 
HNA has made headlines of late, including a bankruptcy announcement earlier in the year and most recently when 
Chairman Chen Feng and CEO Tan Xiangdong were both arrested in late September. Airport representatives in 
Hahn very recently said the arrests would not affect operations. 
Why has the Frankfurt-Hahn airport struggled financially? 
Although the coronavirus pandemic has brought an uptick of freight business to the former US military airstrip, the 
site began losing passenger business long before that. Originally a major hub for Ryanair, Hahn has suffered as the 
Irish discount flyer has increasingly taken its business to larger airports nearby.  
The business has long suffered financial instability, piling up debt and counting on government subsidies to keep it 
solvent.  
Operating Manager Goetzmann said that despite not needing government assistance nor having to cut workers' 
hours during the pandemic, the company still expects to register losses for its fiscal year 2020 financial report. 
Management at Hahn had nevertheless recently said it expected operations to be profitable by 2024, when EU law 
will prohibit airports from receiving government subsidies.

Fuel price rise threatens carriers' recovery Airlines Industry under pressure after cost of oil surges to its highest

A sharp rise in the price of fuel is threatening the airline industry's slow recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
Oil prices climbed to their highest levels in seven years last week, triggering new concerns over carriers' costs as 
patchy passenger demand persists after 18 months of travel restrictions.
The price of jet fuel has doubled to almost $750 per metric tonne over the past year, according to data from the 
International Air Transport Association and Platts.
Last week, Delta Air Lines singled out fuel costs as it forecast a swing back to a loss in the final three months of the 
year, following only its second profitable quarter since the crisis began.
"Fuel prices continue to rise, which will pressure our ability to remain profitable," the airline's chief executive Ed 
Bastian said in a results call.
Airlines would typically try to pass rising costs on to passengers by raising ticket prices but the industry is still 
operating in a highly uncertain environment, with passenger numbers well below normal levels and some carriers 
trying to stimulate the market through low fares.
Fuel price rise threatens carriers' recovery Airlines Industry under pressure after cost of oil surges to its highest 
in seven years
To make the situation worse, many airlines gave up on hedging their future fuel requirements when chaos ripped 
through the oil market last year, leaving them more exposed than usual to the subsequent sharp rise in crude 
prices.
Ryanair took a (EURO)300m hit in its 2020 financial year following the collapse in the price of oil after it employed a 
high level of hedging over the period.
"Most airlines suffered huge losses from fuel hedges last year as demand imploded in the face of the Covid 
pandemic and they were left holding contracts for delivery at prices well above spot," said Mark Simpson, an 
aviation analyst at Goodbody.
"As such, most airlines shrunk or closed their hedge books, leaving them naked in the face of the recent rapid rise 
in fuel costs."
One of the remaining airlines still hedging a significant portion of its fuel is easyJet, which has locked in prices of 
$500 per metric tonne for 55 per cent of its expected fuel requirements for 2022.
"We are in a good place when you compare us to others," easyJet chief Johan Lundgren said last week.
Yet the boss of one European airline said he stood by the decision to give up hedging, saying that for every spike in 
the oil price for which hedging offered protection, there was often a subsequent fall that left carriers out of pocket.
Data from aviation analysts at HSBC show airlines have been able to absorb huge extended swings in the oil price 
from decade to decade, but that it has led to volatile operating margins.

Airlines would typically try to pass rising costs on to passengers by raising ticket prices but the industry is still 
operating in a highly uncertain environment, with passenger numbers well below normal levels and some carriers 
trying to stimulate the market through low fares.
Fuel price rise threatens carriers' recovery Airlines Industry under pressure after cost of oil surges to its highest 
in seven years
To make the situation worse, many airlines gave up on hedging their future fuel requirements when chaos ripped 
through the oil market last year, leaving them more exposed than usual to the subsequent sharp rise in crude 
prices.
Ryanair took a (EURO)300m hit in its 2020 financial year following the collapse in the price of oil after it employed a 
high level of hedging over the period.
"Most airlines suffered huge losses from fuel hedges last year as demand imploded in the face of the Covid 
pandemic and they were left holding contracts for delivery at prices well above spot," said Mark Simpson, an 
aviation analyst at Goodbody.
"As such, most airlines shrunk or closed their hedge books, leaving them naked in the face of the recent rapid rise 
in fuel costs."
One of the remaining airlines still hedging a significant portion of its fuel is easyJet, which has locked in prices of 
$500 per metric tonne for 55 per cent of its expected fuel requirements for 2022.
"We are in a good place when you compare us to others," easyJet chief Johan Lundgren said last week.
Yet the boss of one European airline said he stood by the decision to give up hedging, saying that for every spike in 
the oil price for which hedging offered protection, there was often a subsequent fall that left carriers out of pocket.
Data from aviation analysts at HSBC show airlines have been able to absorb huge extended swings in the oil price 
from decade to decade, but that it has led to volatile operating margins.

A sharp rise in the price of fuel is threatening the airline industry's slow recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
Oil prices climbed to their highest levels in seven years last week, triggering new concerns over carriers' costs as 
patchy passenger demand persists after 18 months of travel restrictions.
The price of jet fuel has doubled to almost $750 per metric tonne over the past year, according to data from the 
International Air Transport Association and Platts.
Last week, Delta Air Lines singled out fuel costs as it forecast a swing back to a loss in the final three months of the 
year, following only its second profitable quarter since the crisis began.
"Fuel prices continue to rise, which will pressure our ability to remain profitable," the airline's chief executive Ed 
Bastian said in a results call.
Airlines would typically try to pass rising costs on to passengers by raising ticket prices but the industry is still 
operating in a highly uncertain environment, with passenger numbers well below normal levels and some carriers

Ryanair, has announced a new route - Derry to Manchester, operating three weekly flights starting from Winter '21. 
As travel recovers to pre-COVID levels, Ryanair's growth continues to lead traffic and tourism recovery across 
Europe.
Ryanair's Director of Commercial, Jason Mc Guinness, said: "As Europe's No.1 airline, Ryanair remains committed 
to re-building Europe's aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of 
passengers to over 225 million by 2026. As Ryanair takes delivery of 55 additional Boeing 737-8200 'Gamechanger' 
aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester.
As consumer confidence in air travel steadily restores, Ryanair is once again calling on the UK Government to 
scrap or suspend APD (Air Passenger Duty) to allow airlines to quickly recover connectivity, jobs and tourism in the 
aftermath of the pandemic."

Wizz Air Holdings is not averse to potential mergers and acquisitions of other airlines in the future, as long as it 
maintains strict cost discipline in the process, Chief Executive József Váradi told Bloomberg.
"Given our low-cost business model, we are not a natural consolidator, and it doesn't come to us intuitively, but 
that's not to say that we won't be looking at opportunities as they arise," he said.
Váradi added that the low-cost carrier had considered 20 potential mergers or acquisitions over the last ten years. 
He said that despite having no ambitions of building IAG International Airlines Group-like holdings, Wizz Air was 
"not blind" to market trends, including consolidation.
Although the LCC has not publicly confirmed it, it was widely understood to be behind the recent takeover proposal 
for easyJet. The British rival rejected the highly conditional and unsolicited offer, deeming it "fundamentally 
undervalued".
According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Wizz Air Holdings (comprising Wizz Air, Wizz Air UK, and Wizz Air 
Abu Dhabi) is the smallest of three main independent LCCs in Europe. It proffers 851,492 weekly scheduled seats, 
compared to 3,030,489 seats on sale by Ryanair Holdings (via Ryanair, Ryanair UK, Buzz, Malta Air, and Lauda 
Europe) and 1,330,708 on sale by easyJet (via easyJet, easyJet Europe, and easyJet Switzerland).
According to its quarterly financial report, as of June 30, 2021, Wizz Air Holdings had EUR1.5 billion euros (USD1.7 
billion) in unrestricted cash.
Váradi also added that the Hungarian LCC had ambitious growth plans and intenda to reach a size 2.5 times larger 
than what it is currently, although he did not specify the timeline for this expansion. That growth will require more 
aircraft. Váradi would not, however, comment on any potential deals with Airbus. Sources recently told Reuters the 
LCC was in talks for at least 100 new A320neo Family aircraft.

•
FTSE 100 up 12 points  
•
UK GDP grows but less than forecast  
•
Banking shares under pressure
3.56pm: Housebuilders support UK market
Leading shares have gained ground and are close to their highs for the day.
The move is not exactly dramatic however: the FTSE 100 has put on just 12.23 points or 0.17% at 7142.46. But at 
least it is in the right direction.
Housebuilders are providing some support after a well received update from Barratt Developments PLC 
(LSE:BDEV), up 5.11%.
Taylor Wimpey PLC (LSE:TW.) has climbed 4.12% while Persimmon PLC (LSE:PSN) has added 3.63%.
But British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines PLC is the biggest faller in the blue chip index, down 
2.84% after Delta Airlines said rising fuel costs were a threat to its profits.
Other airlines have also fallen back, with easyJet PLC down 4.2% and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) off 1.05%.
Banks are also in the red, with Barclays PLC (LSE:BARC) down 2.42%, Standard Chartered PLC (LSE:STAN) 
falling 2.06% and Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) losing 1.7%.
FTSE 100 edges higher but airlines hit by fears that fuel rises will hit profits
Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: "Financials are.. losing ground, a trend that has been accelerated 
somewhat by a disappointing reaction to another decent set of numbers from JPMorgan Chase, though the decline 
in yields because of today's US core CPI numbers, which remained steady at 4%, may also be playing a part."
The FTSE 250 is also higher, up 0.62%.
Top risers in the mid-cap index are investment firm Man Group (LSE:EMG) PLC, up 7.05%, and Darktrace PLC 
(LSE:DARK), 6.13% higher, after both released trading updates.
The UK gains come despite a 149 point or 0.43% fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 0.12% slip on the 
S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite by contrast is up 0.4%.
3.35pm: The persistence of pricing pressures
More on US inflation.
Specifically, the signs from the latest figures that much of the pricing pressures are not coming from what could be 
termed transitory sources.
Caleb Thibodeau at Validus Risk Management, said: "Coming in close to the survey high, the September CPI figure 
adds to the series of upside inflation beats over the past six months. While not a major overshoot, the market 
appears to be turning more apprehensive of continuingly high or 'persistent' inflation numbers. "Previous 
contributions to a higher CPI came predominantly from transitory reopening imbalances, such as airfares, hotel 
rates or used cars. More than half of the 0.4% month-over-month increase for September was from increases in 
food or shelter-related costs, which is a marked shift towards non-transitory price increases. "While the Fed 
continues to encourage inflation in order to achieve 'price stability' as one of its two main mandates, a shift to non-
transitory inflation could be problematic and force monetary tightening on a more shortened timescale. "The FOMC 
has acknowledged that inflation is elevated in its most recent statement, however, only as a result of what it 
deemed to be transitory factors. Given this inflation persistence in the short term and recent employment data, we 
can reasonably expect that the Fed will move forward with a tapering announcement at the November policy 
meeting."
2.51pm: Pricing pressures continue to unsettle markets
Wall Street has made a mixed start to trading as investors assess whether a slightly stronger than expected US 
inflation figure goes against the Federal Reserve's long standing mantra that pricing pressures are transitory.
No doubt things will become clearer from the Fed minutes due to be released later.
But the tone of Fed chair Jerome Powell in his press conference after the last meeting was taken as suggesting rate 
rises could be on the cards sooner than people had been anticipating.
Consistently strong inflation, as shown by the CPI figures, would fit that pattern.
So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 51 points or 0.15% while the S&P 500 is up 0.05% and the 
Nasdaq Composite is 0.48% better.
In the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 0.24 points at 7129.15.
1.53pm: US consumer price index rises
US inflation has come in higher than expected.
The consumer price index rose 5.4% year on year in September, compared to forecasts of an unchanged figure of 
5.3% from August.
Food and energy were among the main drivers, with the latter up 24.8% over the past 12 months.

 Inflation is broadening out. Food and shelter increases together contributed more than half of the seasonally 
adjusted increase in the CPI. With home prices soaring and rents surging, this may just be the tip of the iceberg - 
Greg McBride, CFA (@BankrateGreg) October 13, 2021
The update has seen US markets dip into the red.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now expected to open down 0.14% while the S&P 500 is forecast for a 0.12% 
fall while the Nasdaq Composite is virtually unchanged.
In the UK however the FTSE 100 has recovered nearly all the day's losses and is down just 0.42 points at 7129.81.
12.49pm: JP Morgan beats forecasts
JP Morgan Chase has got the US reporting season off to a good start with better than expected figures.
Third quarter net income rose 24% to US$11.7bn, helped by the release of US$2.1bn from the reserves put aside 
for possible loan defaults during the pandemic.
The bank also benefited from increased revenues from mergers and acquisitions, strength in its wealth 
management arm and a rise in interest income as credit card spending climbed.
Earnings per share rose 28% to US$3.74.

https://t.co/HxucXnMbdH - Stock News Outlet Discord (@StockNewsOutlet) October 13, 2021
Boss Jamie Dimon said: "JP Morgan Chase delivered strong results as the economy continues to show good 
growth - despite the dampening effect of the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions."
The bank recently launced a digital retail bank in the UK as part of its international expansion plans.
In pre-market trading, its shares are up 0.6%.
11.56am: US investors await inflation news and bank results
US stocks are expected to open a touch higher as investors await earnings reports this week from some of the 
country's largest banks. The release of September's consumer price index (CPI) ahead of the market opening, will 
also be watched keenly.  
Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 0.11% in Wednesday pre-market trading, while the 
broader S&P 500 index rose 0.2% and those for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 added 0.51%.
At the close on Tuesday, the Dow eased 118 points to 34,378, while the S&P 500 gave back 11 points to 4,351 and 
the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 20 points to 14,466.
Global inflation concerns have been one of the drivers of risk aversion as energy prices soar and the market 
expects inflation to remain high, unchanged from August's 5.3% year-on-year print.
"With investors doubtless awaiting direction from today's US CPI report, and with bank earnings news and the latest 
FOMC minutes on the horizon too, a relatively quiet session on Wall Street saw the S&P500 post a modest 0.2% 
loss yesterday," commented Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Emily Nicol.
FTSE 100 edges higher but airlines hit by fears that fuel rises will hit profits
"There was little reaction to the predictable news that the House had passed the stopgap bill to raise the debt 
ceiling by $480 billion, providing the Treasury with headroom to meet financial obligations until sometime in 
December." 
JP Morgan kicks off the third-quarter earnings season today. Other notable names reporting financial results this 
week include Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
Back in the UK, and the FTSE 100 is now barely changed, down just 4.15 points at 7126.08.
10.58am: Sterling ahead after UK figures
The pound has edged up after the day's UK data.
It is currently up 0.35% at US$1.3624, on hopes that the UK economy can move forward despite a somewhat 
lacklustre set of GDP and trade figures.
Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, said: "A raft of economic data out of the UK has provided a somewhat 
mixed outlook for economic growth
" August saw a welcome return to growth for the UK, with the July figure revised down into the first negative reading 
since February (-0.1%).
"Gains for the pound highlight a feeling of optimism, with rising growth, industrial production and manufacturing 
production all pointing in the right direction. That helps to build on yesterday's jobs report, which similarly shows 
progress as unemployment and the claimant count continue to fall."
Meanwhile the FTSE 100 continues to drift in the red zone, down 13.63 points or 0.19% at 7116.60.
10.05am: Investors remain cautious
Leading shares continue to edge lower as UK economic growth disappointed amid continuing concerns about 
shortages and rising prices.
But housebuilders are bucking the trend after a well received update from Barratt Developments PLC (LSE:BDEV).
Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "The housebuilders have found themselves in somewhat 
of a sweet spot. While pent-up lockdown demand is starting to wane, people are still motivated to move and that's 
driven house prices higher. According to Barratt, that's been enough to offset build cost inflation, and the group's 
not expecting to deliver any downside surprises this year.
"Supply chain constraints were called out as an industry-wide issue, but Barratt confirmed that so far the logjams 
impacting several other sectors have yet to throw a wrench in the group's plans."
Barratt is up 5.17% while Taylor Wimpey PLC (LSE:TW.) has added 4.05%, Persimmon PLC (LSE:PSN) has put on 
3.63% and Berkeley Group Holdings PLC is 2.38% better.
Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 14.73 points or 0.21%.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: "Equity markets look to have stabilised after a patchy showing 
earlier this week, however it does feel as though investors remain slightly nervous.
"The FTSE 100's biggest fallers in index point terms were a mixture of defensive and cyclical stocks, so investors 
are clearly not falling on one side of the fence. Pharmaceuticals, consumer goods and miners were among the 
stocks in negative territory."
AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:AZN) is down 2.19% while rival GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LSE:GSK) is off 1.22%.
FTSE 100 edges higher but airlines hit by fears that fuel rises will hit profits
Among the miners Rio Tinto PLC (LSE:RIO) has fallen 2.44%.
9.48am: UK trade deficit grows
Still with the UK economy, and the trade deficit widened from £2.9bn in July to £3.7bn in August.
The decline came as exports were hit by COVID-19 and Brexit related shortages.
Total exports fell by £1.3bn or 4.6%, including a 4.3% fall in goods sent to the EU and a 5% fall elsewhere.
Total imports dropped by £1.3bn or 3.1%, with a 5.6% fall from non-EU countries and a 0.5% fall from the EU.
8.48am Back to the 1970s?
The FTSE 100 kicked off in the red as the spectre of 'stagflation' - that compound word redolent of the 1970s - 
began to be whispered.
The economic stagnation/inflation thesis was given some credence by the latest official data.
They showed the UK grew at a slower-than-expected 0.4% in August, while the month earlier number was 
retrospectively downgraded.
At the same time, supply chain issues and steepling energy prices (particularly gas) are forcing up the cost of living 
at a pace not seen in many years.
Indeed, inflation has become a preoccupation of the global markets.
Worries related to this issue were largely behind the poor performances of Wall Street and Asia's main markets.
In London, the morning's top riser was Barratt Developments PLC (LSE:BDEV). It was up 3.2% after a reasonably 
upbeat trading statement and dragged the sector with it. Its sites have remained open despite industrywide 
problems sourcing materials.
Supplying the builders is a company called Brickability, which earlier reported a 300% increase in its revenues. Its 
shares were up 4%.
THG PLC (LSE:THG), the online retailer also known as The Hut Group, continued its descent after a torrid Tuesday 
on which it lost more than a third of its value.
A presentation designed to reassure analysts and investors about the long-term prospects for its Ingenuity e-
commerce platform spectacularly mis-fired. One newspaper said it was met with a "barrage of sell orders".
The reset continued Wednesday with THG shares down a further 4% in the early exchanges.
This despite the company saying it "knows of no notifiable reason for the material share price movement, and that 
no material new information was disclosed at the event."
7.55am: UK economic growth picks up but by less than forecast
The UK economy is showing signs of stalling, growing by less than expected in August and contracting rather than 
rising in July.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show GDP grew by 0.4% in August compared to a forecast 
rise of 0.5%, meaning it is 0.8% below its pre-pandemic level.
The previous month has been revised downwards to show a 0.1% fall rather than a 0.1% increase, mainly due to 
falls in car manufacturing as the global semiconductor shortgage hit the sector.
FTSE 100 edges higher but airlines hit by fears that fuel rises will hit profits
But since then motor manufacturing has recovered somewhat, up 6.6% and helping the manufacturing sector to 
grow by 0.5% in August.
Services were the biggest contributor to the August rise, with output growing by 0.3%, helped by accommodation, 
food and entertainment in the first full month of lockdown restrictions being fully eased.
Construction contracted, with output down by 0.2% in August . The sector is now 1.5% below its pre-pandemic 
level.
Emma-Lou Montgomery associate director at Fidelity International, said: "August's 0.4% growth marks a small 
rebound on July's stalling GDP figures, yet the worry remains that economic growth won't even be in touching 
distance of pre-pandemic levels until well into next year.
"Shortages of HGV drivers and supply-chain disruption continues to trouble multiple sectors and is clearly 
dampening consumer confidence. Forecourts and shelves have been left empty, with mass recruitment drives yet to 
attract the number of staff urgently needed. This all comes in the crucial lead up to Christmas, when suppliers and 
retailers should be firing on all cylinders. But with households facing steep price rises for everyday items, from the 
food shop through to the gas bill, there will be little desire - or capacity - to spend, spend, spend.
"Policymakers will be keen to avoid this troubling mix of slow growth and rising prices from settling in for a 
sustained period of time, but this 'stagflation' doesn't look like it will be going anywhere fast. There is a lot for the 
Chancellor to cover in The Treasury's spending review and Budget announcement in a couple of weeks' time, and 
he will undoubtedly aim to quell concerns while firming up faith in the UK economy. However, it's what's ahead that 
is concerning economists even more, with potential further hits to GDP lurking just around the corner."
But the weakness may temper the Bank of England's thoughts of an interest rate rise this year.
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said: "In the third quarter as a whole, GDP may have risen by 
around 1.4% quarter on quarter. That would be weaker than the 2.1% quarter on quarter rise the Bank of England 
expected in September. So while the chances of an interest rate hike this year have recently risen, a weaker activity 
outlook means it's not a done deal."
6.50am: Leading shares set for unchanged start
The FTSE 100 is expected to open flat at 7,130 ahead of some key releases in the US.
In August US CPI fell back from 5.4% in July to 5.3%, while core prices fell from 4.3% to 4%. No further changes 
are expected to either number, however given the continued resilience in energy prices, and the disruption caused 
by Hurricane Ida that may be more of a hope than an expectation.
Tonight's Fed minutes should give us an insight into the FOMC's thinking from the nature of its statement.
The Fed said that "if progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges a moderation in the pace of 
asset purchases may soon be warranted".
"Nobody really expected this to mean November, but from the tone of Powell's press conference later this appeared 
to be what the FOMC wanted us to think, despite there only being one payrolls report between now and the 
November meeting," commented Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.
"While a taper seems pretty much nailed on now, speculation has now shifted to the timing of the first interest rate 
increase."
"This is especially important given that the number of FOMC members who saw the potential for a rate rise in 2022 
increased from 7 in June, to 9, meaning the committee are evenly split, however that is likely to change if the data 
evolves as expected, which means that a rate hike for 2022 is likely to become a majority view by the end of this 
year, which is a big shift in thinking from earlier this year."
FTSE 100 edges higher but airlines hit by fears that fuel rises will hit profits
"Since that meeting a lot of water has passed under the bridge, we've seen further sharp rises in the costs of 
energy, as well as further supply chain disruption feeding into headline inflation, and we've also seen a pretty 
disappointing payrolls report, that could influence thinking next month."
6.50am: Early Markets - Asia / Australia
Shares in the Asia-Pacific region were mixed on Wednesday as trading in Hong Kong was cancelled because of 
severe weather due to Typhoon Kompasu.
The Shanghai Composite gained 0.25% after China's trade surplus with the U.S. rose to a monthly record of US$42 
billion in September - exports surged by about 30% from a year ago, while imports climbed by just under 17%.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.20% while South Korea's Kospi gained 0.96%.
Australia's S&P/ASX200 dropped 0.11% to 7,272.50 as many companies that move or make things warned of profit 
pressures owing to rising input costs.

Punted as Australia's first independent low-fare start-up, Bonza has announced plans to launch to destinations 
across the country from early 2022 using all economy-class B737 MAXs, subject to regulatory approvals.
Founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Jordan, in a statement, said the airline aims to fill a gap on regional 
routes, particularly into leisure destinations where travel is often limited. Jordan is a seasoned aviation professional 
and former executive with low-cost carriers Cebu Pacific Air, Virgin Blue Airlines, and most recently, FlyArystan.
Bonza is backed by US private investment firm 777 Partners, which also backs Canada's low-fare airline, Flair 
Airlines, and the Southeast Asian-based Value Alliance of low-cost airlines. Managing Partner, Josh Wander, said 
the investment firm sees "huge potential in the Australian market to deliver the benefits and options that an 
independent low-fare airline brings".
Bonza's PR echoes that of Flair, which calls itself a market disrupter. Flair operates a fleet of nine B737-8s and 
three B737-800s to 18 Canadian and six US destinations, promoting itself as a pioneer of ultra-low-fare travel with a 
"mission to liberate the lives of Canadians by providing affordable air travel".
Speaking to the Australian media, Jordan acknowledged Bonza was modelled on Flair, as well as the US's Allegiant 
Air and the UK's Jet2, which he said successfully competed with low-cost giants easyJet and Ryanair on price but 
focused mostly on leisure destinations rather than frequent services between capital cities - something he plans to 
replicate in Australia.
Bonza will have to live up to its name - Australian slang for "very good" - as it will enter a fiercely competitive 
regional market dominated by Qantas low-cost subsidiary Jetstar Airways, Rex - Regional Express, and Virgin 
Australia
But Jordan plans to forego the east coast golden triangle of Sydney Kingsford Smith, Melbourne Tullamarine, and 
Brisbane Int'l, including point-to-point routes, he told Executive Traveller. He does not want to compete with the 
existing carriers, but rather grow the market. He has sent out expressions of interest to 46 airports across all 
Australian states and territories for the initial route network. "Our focus will absolutely be on routes which currently 
today are not operated by any incumbent airline. This is about opening up new routes and new markets, so the 
majority of the routes that we serve will not be operated by existing carriers."
Australian budget startup Bonza eyes early 2022 debut
Bonza's strategy would be to couple lower fares with fewer flights, given that leisure travellers have a more flexible 
timetable. "We will be about offering a generally low-frequency service - maybe two or three times a week - at a 
very low price. That's our model of operation," he explained.
With a glut of affordable aircraft available thanks to COVID-19, he believed the time was right to start a new airline. 
The company expects to start off with "two or three" 186-seat B737 MAX leased through 777 Partners. "But 
depending on how we execute and regulator permitting, we'd expect to grow quite quickly thereafter," Jordan said.

Ryanair found to bar passengers from flying unless they pay back COVID-19-related refunds
Ryanair found to bar passengers from flying unless they pay back COVID-

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has been found to ban passengers who received COVID-19-related refunds 
unless they returned the money.
An investigation by MoneySavingExpert.com revealed that people who had booked trips with the budget airline had 
been asked to pay it back, even days before they were due to depart.
READ: COVID-19 refund case against British Airways and Ryanair dropped by watchdog
Passengers received 'Chargeback' refunds worth between £400 and £630 as they couldn't fly due to government 
advice against non-essential travel.
Chargeback is when a credit or debt card firm gives back a payment to the consumer for a service not provided, 
then charges the retailer for it.
According to the consumer advice website, the situation may be worsened after the UK competition authority 
dropped an investigation into Ryanair and IAG's British Airways for refusing cash refunds to passengers on flights 
they couldn't take due to lockdown restrictions.
IAG-owned British Airways offered vouchers or rebooking for affected passengers while Ryanair provided the option 
to rebook.
Ryanair found to bar passengers from flying unless they pay back COVID-19-related refunds
After an investigation, the CMA said that the law did not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund 
in these circumstances to justify continuing with the case.
Consumer protection law says passengers are entitled to refunds when an airline cancels a flight but does not cover 
refunds when a flight goes ahead but passengers are legally prohibited from taking it.
Shares in Ryanair shed 2% to (EURO)16.64 on Tuesday morning.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has declined to comment on Italian media speculation that it plans to re-open a seasonal 
base at Alghero in Sardinia in the Summer of 2022.
"Ryanair does not comment on rumour or speculation," the carrier said in an emailed response to a query from ch-
aviation. This followed several news reports that the Irish budget carrier was negotiating with the management 
company of Alghero Airport (Società di Gestione Aeroporto di Alghero - SOGEAAL) about re-opening its operational 
base there, after a five-year absence.
La Nuova Sardegna reported that while neither the airline nor SOGEAAL had officially confirmed the move, off-the-
record there had been "several and concordant admissions". While he gave nothing away, SOGEAAL chief 
financial officer and business development director, Fabio Gallo, had observed that Ryanair's winter season 
schedule suggested "that there is renewed attention to Alghero", the report said. Gallo did not respond to a request 
for comment from ch-aviation.
Observers noted that some Ryanair flights already loaded for next summer from Vienna (Austria), Milan Bergamo 
and Bologna (Italy) on some days would be operated at times that the aircraft would have to overnight in Alghero. 
"This means, in my opinion, that the return of the base is being prepared," speculated former mayor of Alghero, 
Mario Bruno.
Reports said Ryanair in the past summer season had strengthened its network at Alghero airport using the airport 
as a launchpad to jumpstart leisure traffic in the region post COVID-19.
According to the ch-aviation ch-aviation schedules module, it currently operates 69 return flights to 22 destinations 
from Alghero, including to:
Italy: Bari, Bologna, Catania, Bergamo, Naples Capodichino, Palermo, Pescara, Pisa, and Venice Treviso;
Spain: Barcelona El Prat, Madrid Barajas, and Seville;
Slovakia: Bratislava;
Belgium: Brussels Charleroi;
Ryanair may reopen Alghero , Sardinia base - reports
Austria: Vienna;
Romania: Bucharest Otopeni;
Germany: Frankfurt Hahn and Memmingen;
France: Marseilles;
UK: London Stansted; and
Poland: Katowice.
A new route to Lisbon (Portugal) will be introduced on November 1, 2021.
Ryanair already holds more than 76% market share in terms of weekly seat capacity at Alghero, according to ch-
aviation capacities data, with Alitalia at around 18% and Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) having captured a 5% share.

The Irish low cost carrier Ryanair sees even more opportunities in the Stockholm region and will expand access by 
adding a new European route from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Venice. The route, to be launched in late March, 
will be the 24th addition in Ryanair's network from the airline's new base, which will open in late October/early 
November.
Ryanair continues its expansion in Sweden and at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. In late March, the airline will open a 
base, initially with two aircraft and twenty new routes to European destinations. At the same time, it will launch 
domestic service to Gothenburg and Malmö and in early December will also start flying to Skellefteå. With the new 
European route, Ryanair will enhance its range of destinations with service to Venice just in time for spring. The 
new service complements the range of other destinations on offer at Arlanda.
Starting March 29, 2022, Ryanair will fly Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN)-Venice Marco Polo Airport (VCE) twice 
weekly, on Tuesdays and Saturdays.
Tickets are now on sale. For more information: ryanair.com. For more information about current traffic at Stockholm

Swedavia has decided to open another terminal at Stockholm Arlanda Airport starting October 26. In addition to 
Terminal 5, Terminal 2 is now also being placed in operation. The decision was made as a result of increased air 
travel and investments in operations at Arlanda by a number of airlines during the autumn.
"We are pleased to note that air traffic and passenger volume have increased at a faster pace than we had thought 
and hoped for and that we need to place another terminal in service earlier than planned. The fact that we are now 
increasing capacity at the airport is an indication that our industry is on its way back," says Peder Grunditz, airport 
director at Stockholm Arlanda Airport.
Air France/KLM, Czech Airlines, Transavia, Vueling and easyJet will initially operate out of Terminal 2. Other traffic 
at the airport will continue to operate out of Terminal 5.
"The airport is working the entire time to adjust the scale of operations in the best way for our airline customers and 
passengers. We will now continue the intensive work together with our partners to place the terminal in operation 
and expand our range of services in order to welcome more passengers," says Peder Grunditz.
In March 2020, Swedavia decided to concentrate all airport operations at Terminal 5 given the pandemic's 
enormous impact on travel. Air travel is now gradually returning, and summer travel has brought a further recovery. 
A number of airlines have announced investments at Arlanda for the autumn, which include Ryanair setting up 
operations and Finnair launching non-stop long haul service from there.
"Naturally, there is still great uncertainty about the market trend, but given the airlines' winter programmes and the 
easing of travel restrictions by a number of countries, we see that we will need more capacity at the airport. We also 
have a number of major investments being made at Arlanda this autumn," says Peder Grunditz.
Swedavia previously adapted operations to meet the increase in travel in Terminal 5, but also to satisfy 
requirements from infectious disease and aviation authorities, including social distancing requirements. For 
example, an additional security checkpoint was opened during the summer.

Covid refunds Watchdog drops Ryanair and BA probe
Covid refunds Watchdog drops Ryanair and BA probe

The competition regulator has dropped its inquiry into British Airways and Ryanair over refunds for passengers 
unable to fly during the pandemic because of a lack of clarity in the law.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it was "insufficiently certain" it could secure refunds for passengers 
affected by Covid-19 curbs.
Enforcement cases were launched in June over concerns the airlines may have broken the law by failing to offer 
refunds for flights passengers could not legally take in pandemic lockdowns.
BA had offered vouchers or the possibility to rebook, and Ryanair the option to rebook. BA at the time called the 
inquiry "incredible", saying any penalty would put jobs at risk.
The CMA said passengers did not have a "sufficiently clear right to a refund in these unusual circumstances to 
justify continuing with the case" after a "thorough examination of relevant law".
Consumer protection law provides for refunds when an airline cancels a flight but does not stipulate that refunds be 
paid when passengers are "legally prohibited" from taking a flight that goes ahead.
Andrea Coscelli, CMA chief executive, said the "time that would be required to take this case through the courts, 
and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money".
Covid refunds Watchdog drops Ryanair and BA probe
Ryanair welcomed the decision, saying many passengers opted to change their bookings without paying the flight 
change fee. BA said it had acted lawfully at all times and had issued nearly 4m refunds. Kate Beioley and Sarah

THE UK's competition watchdog has closed an investigation into the legality of airlines failing to refund passengers 
who were prevented from flying by Covid restrictions.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation in June 2021 after British Airways and 
Ryanair offered customers vouchers or rebooking for flights which were unable to be taken during lockdown.
While passengers are legally entitled to a refund for cancelled flights, the CMA concluded that the law does not 
provide a sufficiently clear right to a refund in circumstances where a flight goes ahead but flyers are legally 
prevented from taking it.
CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said, "we strongly believe people who are legally prevented from taking flights 
due to lockdown laws should be offered a full refund and we launched this investigation in the hope that we would 
be able to secure a positive outcome for consumers." However, in the end, the watchdog concluded that the 
relevant law would give further legal proceedings an "uncertain outcome," meaning neither the time taken to push 
the case through the courts nor the cost to the taxpayer could be justif ied. In a statement Ryanair said it "welcomes 
the CMA's decision to close its investigation."
"We operated a limited schedule during UK lockdowns for customers who travelled for essential reasons. 
Passengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee and many availed of this 
option," the budget airline continued.
British Airways also defended its actions, maintaining they had acted within the law at all times and had issued 
nearly four million refunds on top of offering a flexible bookings policy.
Ryanair and BA will not refund cancelled flights
The CMA called for the law to be clarified on behalf of Ryanair and British Airways passengers who were "unfairly" 
left out of pocket.
CMA action was successful in securing refunds for consumers from holiday providers including 
www.Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays and TUI.

British Airways and Ryanair PLC are no longer being investigated by the UK competition authority for refusing cash 
refunds to passengers on flights they couldn't take due to lockdown restrictions.
IAG-owned British Airways offered vouchers or rebooking for affected passengers while Ryanair provided the option 
to rebook.
After an investigation, the CMA said that the law did not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund 
in these circumstances to justify continuing with the case.
Consumer protection law says passengers are entitled to refunds when an airline cancels a flight but does not cover 
refunds when a flight goes ahead but passengers are legally prohibited from taking it, said the watchdog.
The CMA added that following its review of the law and evidence, alongside expert advice, it had concluded that 
prolonging this investigation could not be justified given the length of time it would take to reach an outcome.
Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, added: "We strongly believe people who are legally prevented from 
taking flights due to lockdown laws should be offered a full refund and we launched this investigation in the hope 
that we would be able to secure a positive outcome for consumers.
"Given the importance of this to many passengers who have unfairly lost out, we hope that the law in this area will 
be clarified."

BA to rehire large number of cabin crew laid off over pandemic Airlines
BA to rehire large number of cabin crew laid off over pandemic; Airlines

British Airways plans to rehire some of the thousands of staff laid off last year as the airline industry begins a 
tentative recovery from the pandemic. Unite, the trade union, says the airline is looking to rehire about 3,000 cabin 
crew after cutting roughly 10,000 jobs, a third of its workforce, last spring and summer when the Covid-19 crisis had 
grounded most of its aircraft.
BA did not confirm how many staff will be taken back, but it has begun offering new cabin crew jobs from next 
summer, according to an internal email seen by the Financial Times.
As the industry restarts flying at a greater scale, staff who took voluntary redundancy last year but had asked to be 
put into a "talent pool" to be called upon when the industry recovered are now being contacted.
The email to BA staff said the easing of UK-US travel restrictions had been a "major milestone" for the industry.
"Finally we are beginning to see some real momentum as more countries open up for travel and consumer 
confidence grows," the email said.
But Unite sharply criticised the airline, which it said was "in bad faith", offering to rehire staff on substantially lower 
pay than in their previous roles.
"BA is championing its intention to recruit thousands of new staff, insultingly even asking those crew it sacked 
needlessly last year to reapply on substantially reduced terms and conditions," the union said.

Other airlines have also begun to restock their staffing pools.
Virgin Atlantic, which created a similar holding pool of laid off cabin crew and pilots, has begun to rehire some, while 
Ryanair has announced a recruitment drive for aspiring pilots.
Although almost every airline made severe cuts to their workforces last year, BA attracted particular criticism for its 
handling of employee relations. This in- cluded a threat, which was never enact- ed, to "fire and rehire" staff on 
worse pay on top of the redundancies.
News of the recruitment came as the airline was standing by to reboot plans to operate a short-haul service from 
Gatwick if pilots agreed to new terms.
Hopes for a new subsidiary with a lower cost base were scrapped earlier this month when Balpa, the pilots union, 
pulled a vote on the plans.
But Balpa has since come to a new agreement with BA, and has balloted its members for a second time, with 
results expected today.
Both the new BA hires and the potential new subsidiary from Gatwick reflect how airline bosses will look to rebuild 
their workforces and operations while cementing the considerable cost savings achieved during the pandemic.
"As we begin our recovery ... which saw us restructure our business to survive, we're starting to build back our 
schedule for next summer," BA said.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), and British Airways will not be required to offer refunds for customers who could not 
legally fly during periods of the COVID-19 lockdown.
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority said Thursday that British law does not provide passengers with a 
sufficiently clear right to a refund.
"We strongly believe people who are legally prevented from taking flights due to lockdown laws should be offered a 
full refund,"  CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli said in a statement. "However, after considering the relevant law and 
gathering evidence in our investigation, we have concluded that the length of time that would be required to take 
this case through the courts, and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money."

 Britain's Competition and Markets Authority ended its probe into International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L) 
British Airways and Ryanair (RYA.L) after determining that the law does not grant airline passengers the right to 
obtain refunds for flights canceled due to COVID-19.
The watchdog on Thursday said it ended its investigation as there would be no legal grounds to force the airlines to 
issue refunds. 
In June, the CMA began probing the airlines for a potential legal breach when they failed to offer refunds for 
customers whose flights were canceled by lockdowns.

The Covid Conundrum - CMA Closes its Investigation into Covid Consumer Refund Rights

Refund Rights

 Article By Paul Jinks[1]  
Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP[2] Global IP and Technology Law Blog[3]  
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has todayannounced[4]it is closing its investigation into the refusal of 
British Airways and Ryanair to provide refunds to consumers who were unable to travel on previously booked flights 
as a result of Covid lockdown restrictions due to uncertainty in the underlying law. 
As we havepreviously discussed[5]in the context of force majeure, the Covid pandemic has for lawyers created a 
'Covid conundrum'― stress testing many legal principles and rights as a result of the underlying law being 
predicated (but not explicitly) on the occurrence of one-off events impacting a small number of parties rather than a 
long-term pandemic with global impact. 
This has been particularly true in the travel industry where significant protections are available to consumers. Many 
operators have sought to argue that those protections were only ever intended to apply to the occasional cancelled 
flight (or at worst the failure of a single operator) but not to what was in effect the legally mandated closure of the 
entire industry for a prolonged period with the associated, and often devastating, financial consequences for 
operators. 
Whilst most operators have begrudgingly accepted that the legal position in the case of cancelled flights which 
never operated is clear - namely that consumers are entitled to a refund rather than simply a voucher or rearranged 
future flight - the legal position is not clear regarding flights which did go ahead albeit with few passengers as a 
result of most consumers being unable to travel on those due to Covid lockdown measures. 
This was the issue that the CMA began investigating in June 2021, but today has conceded that, having reviewed 
all of the applicable law, the lack of clarity coupled with the length of time that would be required to take this case 
through the courts, and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money. The CMA 
The Covid Conundrum - CMA Closes its Investigation into Covid Consumer Refund Rights
will instead focus its efforts on lobbying for clarifications to the underlying law to provide greater certainty for future 
cases. 
The decision is frustrating for many legal observers, as had this case preceded to court it would have provided 
useful insight into the approach of the courts to this Covid conundrum with potential relevance to other claims. 
Whilst the decision of the CMA to seek to clarify the law, presumably by legislative change or industry consensus, is 
to be welcomed, that is likely to be a lengthy process. Thus, for the foreseeable future, the Covid conundrum will 
remain.

       The Competition and Markets Authority in the UK has decided to close the investigation into British Airways 
and Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) for failing to offer refunds for customers who were prevented from flying by Covid 
travel restrictions. In June 2021, the CMA launched a probe into the airlines over concerns they may have broken 
the law.
 The CMA concluded that prolonging the investigation could not be justified given the length of time it would take to 
reach an outcome in the courts and the uncertain outcome. Consumer protection law does not clearly cover 
whether people should be refunded when they are legally prohibited from taking the flight, the CMA noted.
 "Given the importance of this to many passengers who have unfairly lost out, we hope that the law in this area will 
be clarified," said, Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA.
 For most affected passengers by Covid travel restrictions, British Airways offered credit voucher and fee-free 
rebooking options, whilst Ryanair offered a fee-free rebooking option.

With millions of jobs and national economies dependent on a strong restart of the air transport sector, World Routes 
will bring together decision makers from airlines, airports, and tourism authorities in Milan this week (10-12 October) 
to rebuild global air connectivity.
Now in its 26th year, World Routes has made a real impact on the world's route networks with over 3,500 new air 
services being connected to meetings at the event in the last three years alone. More than 125 airlines will be 
present in Milan to develop recovery strategies including Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, 
Delta Air Lines, easyJet, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Iberia Airlines, International Airlines Group, Jet2.com, JetBlue, 
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Wizz Air.
Airline CEOs, government ministers and association leaders will outline actions that the industry must take to 
accelerate the recovery during a series of conference sessions at the event. High-profile speakers include Jozsef 
Varadi, Chief Executive Officer of Wizz Air; Jason McGuinness, director of commercial of Ryanair; Garth Lund, 
CCO of Flair; Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico; Vijay Daryanani, Minister for Business, Tourism, Transport 
and the Port of the Government of Gibraltar; Luis Felipe de Oliveira, Director General of ACI World and Fabio 
Lazzerini, CEO of ITA.
Hosted by SEA Milan Airports, in partnership with the Lombardy Region, the Municipality of Milan, ENIT - Italian 
Tourist Board and Bergamo Airport, World Routes will deliver long-term growth opportunities for the city and wider 
region. Air transport's contribution to the Italian economy is significant, supporting 714,000 jobs and contributing 
(EURO)46 billion to the economy - accounting for roughly 2.7% of Italy's GDP in 2019. Following the impact of 
COVID-19, the positive catalytic effects of air connectivity in increasing trade, tourism, investment, labour supply 
and market efficiency will be more important than ever in helping Italy to rebuild its economy.
Steven Small, director of Routes, said: "Our role has, and will always be, to bring together the world's airlines, 
airports, tourism authorities and route development stakeholders to build air services for the economic and social 
good of every destination."
"By delivering a platform where these stakeholders can meet, World Routes will define the recovery of an industry 
profoundly impacted by Covid-19. The route development industry is about building relationships that create 
effective partnerships and successful networks. And, it is those partnerships that this event will support. The 
innovation, resilience and cooperation demonstrated by the route development community throughout this 
Aviation leaders unite in Milan to rebuild global air connectivity
unprecedented period will continue to be paramount in its road to recovery. By working together, we can accelerate 
the recovery and build back better."
Armando Brunini, CEO of SEA Milan Airports, said: "World Routes is an important appointment for our Industry, we 
can't wait to meet in person once again with delegates from all over the world to share views on the future of the 
aviation industry and, of course, do business! In the next years, airlines need to select the network where there is a 
critical mass of passengers, which is important. And Milan offers this critical mass. Our goal is recovery of 
connectivity and traffic volumes. We need to work hard with all stakeholders involved to create the right 
preconditions for a proper restart especially of long-haul traffic with our priorities being America and Asia and first 
results already arriving. The city of Milan is bouncing back to its usual vibrant and dynamic mood, so we believe to 
be well placed to be at the forefront of recovery. Milan and Lombardy are the venues of major international events, 
one of Europe's recognized centres for finance and business and an extremely enjoyable city. The region 
surrounding Milan was the first in the western world to be hit by this devastating pandemic and we are glad that the 
first post Covid World routes event happens here to symbolically support the relaunch of aviation."

Oct 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] inked a deal with Aemetis (AMTX) for 250 million gallons of blended fuel 
containing sustainable aviation fuel, which is to be delivered over a period of 10 years. The estimated value of the 
agreement with the renewable fuels company is more than $1 billion. The deal[2] is in line with the objective to 
reduce carbon emissions. 
Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] subsidiary Alaska Airlines dominated headlines by virtue of its codeshare agreement with 
the Spanish carrier Iberia Airlines, which expanded its network. European carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] 
September traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 1.6 million on the back of improving air-travel demand 
in Europe. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Per aReuters report[5],Delta'smanagement said that 
the airline's ticket sales stabilized and began to improve. This induces a drop in the bookings due to a spike in 
coronavirus cases induced by the Delta variant. The carrier now expects third-quarter 2021 revenues to fall within 
its initial guidance of a decline of 30-35% from the comparable period's reading in 2019, per the report. Due to 
rising coronavirus cases, Delta previously estimated total adjusted revenues at the lower end of the guided range. 
Per the report, chief executive officer ED Bastian told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the airlines group 
IATA that "For Delta, they bottomed out in the later part of August and the first part of September.' Bastian further 
added, "Business traffic is growing back in the U.S." Business-travel demand persists to be rather slower in 
recovery than leisure-travel demand. 
Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), currently. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. Per Alaska Airlines' agreement with Iberia Airlines, passengers of the Spanish carrier can book travel and 
connect to several routes across Alaska Airlines' network and vice versa, beginning Oct 7. Alaska Airlines 
customers will have easy access to international destinations in Europe, given Iberia's existing nonstop service 
between Los Angeles and Madrid, and a seasonal service between San Francisco, CA and Barcelona. According to 
the deal, Alaska Airlines' Mileage Plan members can earn miles on the Iberia flights. The agreement also offers 
reciprocal elite benefits, such as preferred seat selection; priority check-in, security clearance and boarding; lounge 
access and an extra baggage allowance. Iberia Airlines is a member of the oneworld alliance. 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL 's Environmentally-Friendly Deal, RYAAY's Traffic & More
3. On the back of the improving traffic scenario, Ryanair's September load factor (percentage of seats filled with 
passengers) increased to 81% from 71% in September 2020. The airline operated more than 69,500 flights last 
month. Despite improving from the pandemic-triggered lows, Ryanair's traffic continues to be significantly below the 
pre-pandemic levels. The airline's September 2021 traffic declined 24.8% from the comparable period's tally in 
2019[7]. 
Ryanair's traffic in October is also expected to be high (exceeding 10.5 million) per CEO Michael O'Leary, which 
was mentioned in the previous week's write up[8]. 
4. Southwest Airlines LUV[9] mandated COVID-19 vaccines for all its employees by Dec 8, 2021, in compliance 
with President Joe Biden's vaccination directive for federal contractors. The Dallas-based carrier announced that its 
contracts with the U.S. government require the company to fully comply with the federal vaccination directive. The 
company informed that its employees need to be either fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or granted an exemption 
on religious, medical or disability grounds to continue their employment with the carrier[10]. 
5. September traffic at Gol Linhas GOL[11] moved up marginally on a month-over-month basis. In the same time 
frame, capacity measured in available seat kilometers rose 2.1%. Since traffic surge was less than capacity 
expansion, load factor dipped 1.1 percentage points (p.p) from August levels to 79.1%. On a year-over-year basis, 
traffic surged 36.8% in September. In the same time frame, capacity expanded 38.1%. Since traffic surge was less 
than capacity growth, load factor decreased 0.8 p.p to 79.1% from the year-ago period's levels. Gol Linhas' total 
monthly departures surged 51.7% and seats rose 51.1%. Gol Linhas transported 1.6 million passengers in 
September (up 47.8% on a year-over-year basis). The Latin America-based airline did not operate international 
flights during September. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week although the gains were 
muted in nature. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has inched up 1.7% to $98.85 in the period. Over the course of the 
past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 9%. 
 What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will await the third-quarter 2021 earnings report of Delta Air Lines. The 
airline is scheduled to release September-quarter results on Oct 13.

FORMER British Airways boss Willie Walsh yesterday said airlines will lose up to $201bn (£147.6bn) because of 
Covid-19.
Willie Walsh - who ran British Airways' owner IAG and is now director general of aviation trade body IATA - said the 
sector will have to wait until 2023 to return to profitability.
In an IATA report, Walsh estimated the industry will lose another $52bn this year, but losses will shrink to $12bn in 
2022.
Walsh also hit out at governments over Covid-19 risk management and a "web of rules" for travellers.
He said: "Travel restrictions are a complex and confusing web of rules with very little consistency among them and 
there is little evidence to support ongoing border restrictions and the economic havoc they create."
The aviation industry veteran said cutting costs ahead of rasing airfares "must be at the top of everyone's agenda."
However, his old rivals at Lufthansa predicted higher fares are indeed coming, as airlines can't afford to sell tickets 
at pre-pandemic prices and expect to pay off debt.
"I think we see more disciplined players now because everybody took on debt... Prices were too low before Covid, 
(EURO)9 or £9 from the UK to Portugal is not healthy for the industry," he told the Telegraph.
Despite a disastrous 2020, the German carrier has registered a significant market recovery in the second quarter of 
2021, with operating loss based on the earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) increasing from a loss of 
(EURO)1.7bn in 2020 to (EURO)952m this year.
Ex- BA boss: Hit for airlines from Covid at $200bn
Lufthansa is not the only airline to show improvements. According to data out yesterday, low-cost carriers Ryanair 
and Wizz Air have seen an increase in passenger numbers compared to September last year.

The world's airlines are set for recovery according to the industry body, but not before more huge losses in 2022.
IATA director general Willie Walsh said the industry was "past the deepest point" of the coronavirus crisis but 
serious issues still remain.
Losses in 2022 will be around US$11.6bn, said IATA, against US$137.7bn in 2020 and US$51.8bn this year.
The estimates for both this year and last were higher than originally estimated, though the 2002 forecast is a big 
improvement on IATA's worst-case numbers.
Earlier, Ryanair PLC has reported that it carried 10.6mln passengers in September or more than double this time a 
year ago.
Load factors on its planes also rose to 81% from 71% in September 2020.
Shares in Ryanair rose 2.6% to a year's high of (EURO)17.67 while British Airways owner IAG rose 1% to 190.06p, 
easyJet was flat at 702.8p and Wizz Air shed 1% to 5,160p.
British Airways today said it would revive its plans to start a shout-haul route at Gatwick if pilots accepted a new 
contract offer put to them today.
The UK government today also scrapped its traffic light system with the number of countries on the red list cut to 
around twelve from 54.
Ryanair shares hit year's high as IATA says airlines past worst of crisis
Travellers coming from countries not on the red list can enter the UK without a pre-departure test. There will be no 
change for those arriving from red list countries.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Monday reported improvement in 
passenger numbers in September, ahead of UK travel rules being relaxed, offering a rosier outlook for the carriers. 
Ryanair saw traffic more than double to 10.6 million in September from 5.2 million a year ago, while load factor 
improved to 81% from 71%. September's figure slipped from August's 11.1 million passengers, however, but was 
up on July's 9.3 million. 
Wizz Air, meanwhile, flew 3.0 million passengers in September, up 91% on a year ago, with an improved load factor 
of 78.4% versus 64.6%.
"Wizz Air announced new routes from Debrecen [in Hungary] to Brussels-Charleroi [Belgium], Belgium and Kyiv-
Zhulyany, Ukraine. New routes will be operated twice a week from the middle of December 2021. In addition, Wizz 
Air announced the restart of three routes from Debrecen to Tel-Aviv, Moscow, and Santorini. Together with new 
services, Wizz Air now offers 10 routes from Hungary's second largest city," Wizz added. 
The updates from the two budget airlines come the same day as the UK's traffic light travel system involving green, 
amber and red lists were scrapped to make travel "easier and cheaper".
Locations are now categorised as either on the red list or not - and there are UK press reports that the number of 
countries on the red list will be slashed to nine from 54 later in the week, with destinations such as Brazil, Mexico 
and South Africa expected to be opened up to quarantine-free travel.
Fully vaccinated residents – and unvaccinated under 18s – from more than 50 countries and territories can now 
enter the UK without needing to complete a pre-departure lateral flow test, take a day-eight post-arrival PCR test 
costing around GBP65, or self-isolate at home, with just a single day-two post-arrival test needed.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair and Wizz post passenger hikes before new UK rules
People arriving from a red tier destination will still be required to spend 11 nights at a quarantine hotel, costing 
GBP2,285 for solo travellers.
Shares in Ryanair were 2.4% higher EUR17.64 each in London on Monday morning, while Wizz Air shares were 
marginally higher at 5,216.00 pence. Elsewhere in the travel sector, British Airways-parent International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA was 1.5% higher at 190.92p, while easyJet PLC was 0.3% higher at 705.80p.

TUI fly (Germany) (X3, Hanover) and Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) have had respective cases at the European Court of 
Justice dismissed, which they filed in 2018 seeking to reverse an earlier decision by the European Commission 
ordering them to return subsidies received for flights from Klagenfurt, a dual-use civilian and military airport in 
southern Austria.
As ch-aviation reported at the time, the European Union regulator had argued that the subsidies handed to the 
airlines between 2002 and 2012 under service and marketing agreements distorted competition, and in 2016 it 
ordered the two carriers to return a total of EUR12.7 million euros (USD14.7 million) plus interest.
Most of this sum, EUR9.6 million (USD11.1 million) according to Brussels' estimates, had gone to Hapag-Lloyd 
Express, which merged with Hapag-Lloyd Flug in 2007 to form TUI fly, while TUI fly itself had allegedly received an 
additional EUR1.1 million (USD1.3 million) and Ryanair around EUR2 million (USD2.3 million).
The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest court, agreed with the European Commission in 
both cases, rejecting on September 29 the two airlines' separately filed challenges against the order to repay the 
"illegal aid". Ryanair said it would appeal by taking its case to Europe's highest court, the European Court of 
Justice.
Klagenfurt Airport has been owned and operated by Kärntner Flughafen Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (KFBG) since 
1939, and since 2003 the shares in KFBG have been held by the province of Carinthia (80%) and the city of 
Klagenfurt (20%). In November 2008, the province's 80% stake was transferred to Kärntner Landes- und 
Hypothekenbank-Holding, a Carinthia state holding company. Brussels therefore classed the payments to the 
airlines as state aid.
Ryanair's case (T-448/18 Ryanair and Others v Commission) consisted of six pleas, TUI fly's (T-447/18 TUIfly v 
Commission) of seven pleas. In its verdicts, amounting to 434 paragraphs in the former and 215 in the latter, the 
court ruled that "the action must be dismissed in its entirety" in both cases and that the applicants must bear their 
own legal costs and pay the European Commission's costs.
Contacted by ch-aviation, TUI fly declined to comment, while while Ryanair said it "yesterday (29 Sep) noted and 
confirmed that it would appeal to the EU Court of Justice the ruling of the EU General Court regarding historical 
agreements between Ryanair and Klagenfurt airport. Ryanair urges the European Commission to stop rubber-
Tui fly, Ryanair Klagenfurt suits denied, Ryanair to appeal
stamping multi-billion euro state bailouts of bankrupt flag carrier airlines and use its considerable resources to 
tackle cosy deals between legacy airlines and their monopoly hub airports that prevent the emergence of fresh 
competition."
Klagenfurt has seen minimal scheduled traffic since the subsidies were terminated, and even less since the Covid-
19 outbreak. According to the ch-aviation capacities module, it currently sees 12 weekly flights, ten of them to 
Vienna courtesy of Austrian Airlines (OS, Vienna) and two to Cologne/Bonn operated by Eurowings (EW, 
Düsseldorf).

Japanese lessor remarkets Garuda aircraft

Japanese lessor Fuyo General Lease (FGL) is taking back a 2012-vintage Boeing 737-800 from distressed flag 
carrier Garuda Indonesia; the 162-seater will be available for new lease from the first quarter of 2022, the firm 
confirms.
Also available for immediate lease is a 2011-vintage 737-800 that has come off its initial term with Ryanair. That 
unit is in a 189-seat single-class configuration.
In its annual report for the fiscal year ended 31 March, Fuyo confirmed that in the prior 12-month period it grew its 
aircraft portfolio to 44 aircraft, from 41 previously.
Airfinance Journal previously reported that Fuyo had acquired via sale and leaseback three 2017-vintage Airbus 
A320 aircraft from Allegiant Air. AFJ also reported that Fuyo had been mandated for the sale and leaseback of a 
new A320neo unit with Peach Aviation.
Like many lessors, Fuyo's aircraft division has had to deal with bottom line slippage because of restructurings at 
airlines.
"In aircraft operating leases, we expanded our portfolio by purchasing three aircraft and receiving an order for one. 
At the same time, amid dramatic changes in the market environment brought about by Covid-19, we restructured 
our portfolio to reflect changes in the earnings performance and financial position of airlines, and aircraft value," 
Fuyo said in its annual report.
"We also purchased used engines that are close to retirement to move into the part-out business, with an aim to 
expand into aircraft-related business areas. While continuing to monitor market trends, we aim to create new 
earnings opportunities by seeking stable earnings opportunities through portfolio restructuring and building a value 
chain for the aircraft business through expansion into peripheral business areas," it added.
In the ongoing fiscal year 2022, Fuyo hopes to expand "through investments and joint ventures". It also would like 
to "strengthen sales activities for domestic Japanese operating lease investors in Japan and expand business 
partnerships by using the extensive network of UK-based ALM".
Japanese lessor remarkets Garuda aircraft
In FY21, Fuyo had aircraft assets worth JPY148.4 billion, down from JPY164.9 billion listed the previous year. 
Fuyo's return on asset declined to 0.2% in the 12 months ended 31 March 2021, from 2.1% the previous year.
In June, Fuyo issued JPY20 billion worth of bonds: a seven-year issuance, amounting to JPY10 billion at a 0.26% 
coupon; and a 10-year JPY10 billion issuance priced at 0.36%.

Operating lessors Air Lease (ALC) and GECAS accounted for five Boeing cancellations in September, bringing net 
orders registered by the US manufacturer to 22 units last month.
ALC cancelled one Rolls-Royce engine Boeing 787-9 order while GECAS withdrew orders for four 737 Max aircraft, 
according to Boeing data.
Both lessors still have a combined 153 737 Max aircraft and 34 787 family aircraft on order.
Orders for 10 737 Max and five 777Fs came from unidentified customers. 777 Partners increased its 737 Max order 
by six units while FedEx ordered an additional 777F.
Boeing delivered a total of 35 aircraft last month, including eight widebody aircraft comprising one 747-8F to United 
Parcel Service, two 767Fs to FedEx, two 777-300ERs to Aeroflot Russian Airlines and one 767 tanker for the US 
Air Force.
On the narrowbody side, Ryanair received seven 737 Max aircraft in September. Turkish Airlines also accepted 
delivery of five 737 Max, Air Lease four, and CDB Aviation and SMBC Aviation Capital one unit each.
The manufacturer has handed over a total 167 737 Max aircraft in the nine months ended 30 September, with 62 
deliveries in the third quarter versus 47 in the second quarter.
"We made important progress driving stability throughout our operations in the third quarter, as we prioritized safety 
and quality and worked to deliver for our customers," the company said.
"We increased 737 MAX deliveries in the quarter, and progressed in safely returning the 737 MAX to service in 
more international markets," Boeing added.
It also said it is continuing to complete inspections across the 787 programme, which accounts for 14 deliveries so 
far this year.
"Production resources remain focused on inspections and rework and the 787 production rate remains lower than 
five airplanes per month," Boeing continued.
Lessors cancel Boeing orders
"While these efforts continue to impact deliveries, we're confident this is the right approach to drive stability and 
first-time quality across our operations and to position the program for the long term as market demand recovers."

LCCs could experience rise in business travel demand post-Covid
LCCs could experience rise in business travel demand post-Covid

Highlight: As the world eases out of the pandemic, business travel is expected to return the slowest. In 2020, 
international trips fell by 75%, according to GlobalData traveler demands and flows database. However, as travel 
restrictions begin to ease worldwide, and government support schemes end, businesses must readjust their travel 
management programs to meet the financial constraints of the business. As a result, business travelers may switch 
from traditional legacy carriers and premium cabins to more affordable alternatives presenting an opportunity for 
low-cost carriers (LCCs) to gain a larger foothold in the business travel market.
Body
Corporate travel budgets have reduced According to a GlobalData poll*, 43% of respondents said their business 
has cut back significantly on its corporate travel budget, highlighting Coronavirus's impact on business travel. With 
travel budgets scaled-back, business travelers could reduce flying altogether and stricter budgets could mean frugal 
travel decisions must be made. Low-cost carriers have a prime opportunity to position themselves more 
aggressively as a cost-effective alternative to the prestigious legacy carriers such as BA, American Airlines and Air 
France, to name a few. 
The pandemic has changed business travel management programs. As a result of slashed corporate travel 
budgets, organizations will now urge many employees to find the lowest cost itineraries for their trip. Premium travel 
may be scrapped by some. Therefore, low-cost airlines have a significant scope to evolve its business travel 
proposition and target new demand. The concern for full-service carriers (FSCs) is that LCCs have established 
products. In 2016, Ryanair crafted a bundle package, 'Ryanair Business Plus', which provides fast-track security, 
priority boarding and ticket flexibility. easyJet also offers a business plus memberships, with similar benefits. Other 
low-cost airlines are emerging in the long-haul space too increasing pressure on FSCs. Transatlantic flights with 
JetBlue and the anticipated launch of Norse Atlantic show that low-cost airlines are already testing the waters on 
traditionally high yielding business travel routes. FSC's need to adapt This potential market behavior will put more 
pressure on FSCs. Cost is likely to be a deciding factor for most travelers, but business travel was more about 
convenience pre-pandemic. Full-service carriers need to find new ways to offer more value to businesses (not just 
passengers) and differentiate product offering. Strong relationships with TMC's (Travel Management Companies) 
are essential because businesses are more likely to use a singular third party for procurement reasons. Further 
LCCs could experience rise in business travel demand post-Covid
enhancement to business loyalty programs, such as the Emirates Business Rewards and BA On Business, is an 
ideal way to appeal directly to organizations looking to extract value from their travel programs. Nevertheless, in 
these testing times we are likely to see some exciting new product developments within the business travel sector 
from a multitude of airlines. *GlobalData Poll, 347 respondents, closed 16th April 2021

Ashley's future son-in-law joins the £100m club
Ashley's future son-in-law joins the £100m club

I t is a nice round number. Maybe that is why £100m is the figure of choice for the entrepreneurial chief executive's 
incentive scheme.
József Váradi at Wizz Air has one.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has one. And now Michael Murray, Mike Ashley's future son-in-law and soon to be chief 
executive of Frasers Group (formerly known as Sports Direct), has one too.
These are sometimes plugged as the types of high risk, high reward schemes on offer in private equity, paying out 
big but only if stretching targets are hit.
But it's the fact that £100m is such a very large number that seems to stick in the throat of the proxy agencies that 
advise investors how to vote. They don't put it like that, of course. "The terms of the scheme are not in line with UK 
best practice," ISS said of Frasers' scheme.
That is one way to characterise a pay plan that gives a 31-year-old former property developer who happens to be 
marrying the founder's daughter a £100m slice of a publicly listed company, despite limited evidence of his 
management expertise.
Ashley's future son-in-law joins the £100m club
Murray has been Frasers' "head of elevation" since 2018 and was in charge of the property division for two years 
before that. Maybe he is uniquely qualified to run Frasers, especially if one of the main requirements of the job is 
getting along with majority owner Ashley. That could be worth £100m in itself.
As it happens, there was more to dislike in Frasers' scheme than just the number. Glass Lewis and Pirc suggested 
investors vote against it, as 49.1 per cent of independent ones did. The share price has to more than double over 
four years for Murray to get his money. It only has to stay there for 30 days, though. And once the conditions are 
met, he can sell half straight away and the rest a year later.
But technical gripes aside, the proxy agencies' opposition was entirely predictable. They didn't like Boohoo's £150m 
scheme. They didn't support Cineworld's £130m one. And they didn't support Wizz Air's £100m plan, even though 
ISS described reservations about the scheme structure as "ancillary issues". In the end, "the maximum opportunity 
is considered excessive and no compelling explanation has been provided to justify the quantum", ISS concluded. 
In other words: £100m is too much money.
Predictable too, that when put to a shareholder vote all the plans have passed. So is there any point in the proxy 
agencies' protestations?
They do result in a rap on the knuckles. Academic literature indicates an ISS recommendation to vote against 
causes 10 to 25 per cent of shareholders to do so. Companies where 20 per cent or more of votes are cast against 
a pay proposal have to explain themselves to investors and are put on the Investment Association's naughty list.
But it may be that boards increasingly do not care. Losing a CEO over pay can be bad: Smith & Nephew shed 9 per 
cent of its market cap when it refused to meet
Namal Nawana's pay demands.
Whereas before no board wanted to secure less than 90 per cent support for a pay vote, now more companies are 
comfortable with 50 or 60 per cent support so long as the resolution passes, one pay consultant says.
Tom Gosling, a board adviser, points out that it is far from clear that ISS is good at picking out policies that will be 
bad for investor returns.
What proxy advisers' recommendations do is provide some investors with reputational insulation. They can say they 
voted against a proposal to put the next Persimmon-type scheme - where executives did walk away with more than 
£100m - in place. And, big flashy bonus schemes aside, Britain has actually experienced a period of some pay 
restraint over the past decade. Deloitte research shows the median FTSE 100 CEO received £2.85m in pay in 
2020, the fourth consecutive year of decline.
You can't justify a £100m pay plan for a UK public company by reference to peers. You probably can't justify it at all. 
But at least if these schemes do pay out, £100m will be a small proportion of total shareholder return. And thanks in 
part to the proxies' influence, a decent chunk of investors can point to their righteous objections.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) is re-opening a two-aircraft base at Cork in the Summer of 2022, representing a full 
recovery of its pre-pandemic passenger capacity at the Irish airport and the return of 20 routes, amongst them 
Birmingham Int'l and Edinburgh, which are unserved following the collapse of Stobart Air.
The move will be a USD200 million investment in Cork Airport, the airline announced in a statement, adding it had 
also restored its pre-pandemic capacity for the next summer at Shannon, Knock, and Kerry airports.
The Irish Times reported that Ryanair had struck a deal on charges with the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), which is 
extending airline incentives at Cork to October 2022. The airport said it had worked closely with Ryanair and the 
DAA over the last months to extend the traffic recovery scheme to the end of October 2022 to incentivise Ryanair to 
return its capacity to pre-pandemic levels. "This is fantastic news for Cork Airport and the entire Southwest region, 
as the restoration of the two aircraft base will secure 60 Ryanair jobs and deliver thousands of tourism jobs in the 
Cork area," the airport said.
The airline warned that a government failure to fund a similar extension at Dublin Int'l would leave the Irish capital 
with fewer than two-thirds of its pre-pandemic services next summer.
Ryanair's Cork winter 2021/22 recovery schedule includes the following destinations:
Spain: Alicante, Lanzarote, Malaga, and Tenerife Sur;
UK: Birmingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, London Gatwick, London Luton, and London Stansted;
Poland: Gdansk and Poznan.
The Cork summer 2022 summer 2022 schedule will include:
Spain: Alicante, Lanzarote, Malaga, Palma de Mallorca, Tenerife, Girona, Reus, and Las Palmas;
UK: Birmingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Gatwick, Luton, and Stansted;
Poland: Gdansk and Poznan;
Ryanair to reopen Cork base from late 1Q22
France: Bordeaux and Carcassonne;
Portugal: Faro;
Italy: Milan Bergamo.
Ryanair closed its base in Cork, along with Shannon, in October 2020 in light of weaker bookings due to flight 
restrictions imposed by European Union governments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rome urgently tenders for Sardinian PSO to replace Alitalia

The local government of Sardinia, an autonomous region in Italy, has launched an urgent tender to replace Alitalia 
(AZ, Rome Fiumicino) on territorial continuity routes to mainland Italy once the flag carrier goes out of business on 
October 14, 2021.
Having secured the approval of the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport as well as the European 
Commission, the regional authority requested proposals from 11 carriers that currently operate scheduled services 
in Italy namely Ryanair (which previously challenged the idea of subsiding flights between Sardinia and the 
mainland), easyJet, Volotea, Blue Air (Romania), Vueling Airlines, DAT, Blue Panorama Airlines, Neos, ITA - Italia 
Trasporto Aereo (Alitalia's successor which will launch operations on October 15), Air Malta, and Wizz Air. Smaller 
carriers operating in Italy, such as Tayaranjet, AlbaStar, or EGO Airways, were not invited.
ITA is formally a new company that cannot automatically assume any of Alitalia's assets or contracts. While it 
acquired some of its predecessor's aircraft and is expected to bid for its brand, the PSO contract is not tradeable 
and needs to be reallocated competitively.
The deadline for submissions was September 29, 2021. The initial contract will be awarded for just seven months 
under an emergency dispensation connected to Alitalia's closure.
The budget for this short-term contract is EUR37 million euros (USD43.2 million) and will cover the same routes as 
the current agreement, namely from each of Alghero, Cagliari, and Olbia in Sardinia to each of Milan Linate and 
Rome Fiumicino. In return, the carriers will have to offer discounted fares to all eligible residents of Sardinia without 
limit, up to the full capacity of the aircraft. Discounted fares to Rome will be capped at EUR39 (USD45.6) one-way, 
while flights to Milan will be restricted to EUR47 (USD54.9).
In line with the expected number of passengers, the services from Cagliari to Milan and Rome will be eligible for a 
maximum subsidy of EUR7 million (USD8.2 million) and EUR8.6 million (USD10 million), respectively, from Alghero 
- EUR3 million (USD3.5 million) and EUR5.7 million (USD6.7 million), and from Olbia - EUR3.5 million (USD4.1 
million) and EUR5 million (USD5.8 million).
The government hopes the new operator(s) will assume all six routes on October 15 to avoid any break in 
scheduled services connecting Sardinia to the mainland.
Rome urgently tenders for Sardinian PSO to replace Alitalia
During the seven-month interim solution, the authority plans to launch a permanent tender for the next two years 
with a tentative budget of EUR46 million (USD53.7 million).

Esken confirms no passenger flights from Southend Airport over winter
Esken confirms no passenger flights from Southend Airport over winter

(Alliance News) - Esken Ltd on Thursday said it has delayed the restart of commercial passenger services from 
London Southend Airport to Spring 2022 as it looks to save cash.
The Isle of Man-based company, formerly known as Stobart Group, has two core assets: Southend Airport and 
biomass fuel provider Stobart Energy.
Shares were down 1.2% to 14.68 pence in London on Thursday midday. 
The only passenger airline operating at Southend is Ryanair Holdings PLC, which announced last month it would 
end its limited service on November 1. It was the latest blow for the airport, after easyJet PLC pulled out last year. 
Wizz Air Holdings PLC operates one route to and from Southend, but it's currently suspended. 
Esken said last month that it was in talks with a range of airlines, targeting a return of passenger flights ahead of the 
peak summer season in 2022. 
On Wednesday, Esken confirmed the suspension of passenger services, saying "the decision taken alongside our 
airline partners to delay the restart of commercial passenger operations to Spring 2022 will further allow [Southend] 
to minimise operating expenditure and maintain tight cost control," as demand continues to be hit by the pandemic. 
Talks with airlines over a return to passenger services are ongoing and management is confident, Esken added.
Southend still has GBP19.7 million cash ring-fenced after a deal with Carlyle Group, in which the private equity firm 
could eventually get a 30% stake in the airport. 
The lack of income from passenger services was partially offset by cargo flights, Esken added. 
Meanwhile, Esken's energy business is trading in line with expectations and returned to pre-Covid levels of 
profitability and cash generation in the first half of the 2022 financial year, which ends February 28.

Belarus officials face travel curbs under Brussels visa plan Lukashenko regime

Brussels plans to make it harder for Belarusian officials to get EU visas, a step designed to punish Alexander 
Lukashenko's regime amid accusations from his exiled opponents the bloc has failed to do enough to help their 
cause. The European Commission said yesterday it would partially suspend a visa issuance agreement with 
Belarus, a move that would make it harder for state officials to enter the EU but not affect ordinary citizens.
The crackdown comes after Lukashenko facilitated illegal migration into the bloc this summer, allowing thousands 
of migrants to cross into Lithuania, Latvia and Poland from Belarus. Brussels said the flow of people was driven by 
a co-ordinated Minsk scheme to put pressure on the eastern EU flank.
That follows Lukashenko's fraudulent re-election last year, which sparked mass pro-democracy protests in the post-
Soviet state. The democracy movement faced a brutal crackdown by security services that involved mass jailings 
and widespread reports of torture and murder.
The EU imposed some economic sanctions against Minsk in June, after the regime forced a Ryanair flight to land in 
order to detain a dissident on board, but senior members of the country's opposition have criticised what they say is 
Brussels' slow and limited response.
"Lukashenko does not fear the EU," said Pavel Latushko, a member of the opposition Co-ordination Council set up 
by Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's rival in the stolen election.

"A dictator takes 100 steps forward and a democracy responds by slowly taking just one," he said.
"The EU really does not respond to the hybrid war being waged by Minsk. In a European country a criminal holds 
power and kills people. This is Saddam Hussein in Europe."
Announcing the visa policy change, European Commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas said the step was "a 
strong signal ... that is crystal clear".
Latushko, who is visiting senior EU officials this week in Brussels to demand more action, said EU countries should 
instead legally de-recognise Lukashenko's administration, which would restrict its access to international funding, 
such as a $1bn package provided by the IMF to Minsk last month.
He said Brussels should also designate Belarus as a "terrorist state" because of evidence of "crimes against 
humanity" by Lukashenko's security services.
The commission's proposal to restrict visas requires approval from the EU council of member states.

Ryanair’s pilot push
Low-cost carrier needs crews, but chief executive O’Leary suggests the value of UK licence has fallen in wake of 
Brexit
Ryanair chief executive ­Michael O’Leary insists the airline is still interested in recruiting UK-licensed cockpit crews, 
although he suggests the value of a UK licence has deteriorated in the wake of Brexit.
UK cockpit union BALPA recently urged the government to restore mutual recognition of pilot licences between the 
UK and EU, a status ended by the post-Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Ryanair operating subsidiary Lauda Europe recently sought crews for a UK base but required European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) licences.
O’Leary points out that the carrier still needs to hire UK-licensed ­pilots to operate non-EU routes from its UK bases, 
and adds that the company is also “growing” the Ryanair UK division it set up to cope with Brexit disruption.
Route expansion
“UK licences are not that valuable,” he said during a briefing on 31 August at which Ryanair unveiled a winter route 
expansion from London’s Luton and Stansted airports.
“But we don’t care whether [pilots have a] UK licence or EU licence, we can operate with both. What we want is 
well-trained, hard-working pilots and cabin crew.”
He sardonically refers to Brexit as having been a “stunning success”, highlighting strains in various supply chains, 
and adds that the UK’s separation from EASA could also pose operational difficulties.
“We fear a kind of divergence between [UK Civil Aviation Authority] regulations on pilots and cabin crew training 
and EU regulations on pilot and cabin crew training,” he says.
No Headline In Original
O’Leary claims the airline has been able to recover quickly by retaining pilots and cabin crew, on reduced pay, and 
allowing them to stay current.
But the carrier is expanding its fleet with the introduction of Boeing 737 Max 8-200 jets, and he states: “There’s a bit 
of a training mountain for us to climb this winter. We need to train a lot of people to crew 55 aircraft next summer.”
He says about 450 pilot cadets are passing through training ­bases, but adds that the airline’s application list for 
qualified 737 pilots is “nearing two or three thousand”.
“There’s a lot of pilots out there,” he says, highlighting the number of cockpit crew shed by crisis-driven job cuts. 
“There’s [also] a lot of cabin crew out there – less so in the UK, but we’re a relatively high-paying employer in the 
UK on the ­cabin crew side, so we’re not seeing any great difficulty.”
Meanwhile, O’Leary has scorned British Airways’ proposals to establish a lower-cost short-haul subsidiary at 
London Gatwick.
BA’s short-haul operation at ­Gatwick has been on hold as a ­consequence of the air transport crisis, but the 
suspension is complicated by the reinstatement of slot-utilisation thresholds.
BA chief executive Sean Doyle said at the end of July that the airline had the “flexibility” to “hold the slot portfolio” at 
Gatwick for the winter, but was looking at “options” for summer 2022.
“We need to be competitive ­because the market will be very competitive coming out of the pandemic,” he said. “We 
are probably going to communicate plans in relation to Gatwick, dependent on discussions with our stakeholders.”
New subsidiary
BA has yet to confirm details of the Gatwick strategy, but union representatives indicate discussions involve a new 
short-haul subsidiary.
The airline had tentatively agreed, at the 2019 Paris air show – prior to the crisis – to acquire up to 200 737 Max 
jets, signalling that a number would be deployed at Gatwick for short-haul services.
But O’Leary scoffs at BA’s Gatwick plan, describing its repeated attempts to set up UK low-cost operations – such 
as Go – as “the very definition of insanity”.
“If you were setting up a low-cost airline in London the last airport you’d set up in is Gatwick,” he says. “It won’t work 
and they’ll lose more money doing it.”
O’Leary says BA does not want to surrender its slots to Gatwick budget carriers such as Wizz Air or EasyJet – 
which ultimately bought Go, after BA decided the airline did not fit with its strategy.
“The problem for BA is that, to have a successful low-cost short-haul airline in Gatwick, you have to compete with 
yourself at Heathrow,” he says. “And BA doesn’t want to compete with itself at Heathrow.”
But HSBC analysts, in contrast, are encouraged by BA’s Gatwick restructuring, expecting it to be “constructive” and 
supportive of mid-term profitability for parent IAG.
“We see the logic for IAG in occupying its Gatwick slot portfolio with an efficient low-cost carrier rather than mainline 
BA,” the bank says in a research note. “On a medium-term basis, we think this should be profit-accretive.”
IAG already has low-cost ­o­perations in Spain, with Vueling, Iberia Express and its long-haul operation Level. ◗

Airline ‘disappointed’ as Boeing fails to close pricing gap for Max 10
Boeing and Ryanair have ended discussions over a potential 737 Max 10 order, citing an inability to reach 
agreement on pricing for the variant.
The budget airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, had indicated on 31 August that the two sides were not 
making much progress on closing a “gap” on price expectations.
Ryanair says a Max 10 agreement would have followed the deliveries of its current fleet of 737 Max 8-200 jets, of 
which it has 210 on order.
While O’Leary had not specified the scale of a Max 10 deal, he had pointed out that the airline would typically “like 
to see” the introduction of 50 aircraft per year over four or five years.
But Ryanair on 6 September said the two sides have agreed “to waste no more time” on the pricing negotiations.
“We are disappointed we couldn’t reach agreement with Boeing on a Max 10 order,” says O’Leary. “Boeing has a 
more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not paying high 
prices for aircraft.”
The Max 8-200 deliveries will take the airline’s fleet to over 600 aircraft by mid-decade.
“We have a more-than-sufficient order pipeline to allow us to grow strongly over the next five years,” O’Leary says.

high enough? To fly me over yesterday? 
 Don't tell me, I know this Damn Yankees? 
 Ding ding! If it's not Mr. Mister with 'Broken Wings,' you know 'High Enough' is pretty much my other default song 
every time Boeing comes up 
https://research.banyanhill.com/X190X142 
First things first: What's up with Boeing? 
 Several factoids, several lil' newsworthy nuggets, sent BA 4% higher yesterday. But yesterday's rally was just a 
memory — just a memory — and BA came crashing down 2% today. 
 Yesterday, Bernstein Analyst Douglas Harned upgraded Boeing stock to outperform[1]. (I thought the Bernsteins 
were bears, not bulls? Hmm.) Harned also raised his price target from $252 to $279[2], optimistic that air travel will 
tick up and improve over the next few months. 
 Of course, this is barring any new COVID-19 variants emerging, which analysts in their infinite wisdom 'do not 
expect.' I'd say that's a pretty big variable to not expect or plan for, but let's back-burner the pandemic for a sec, if 
that's possible. 
 There's more greatness coming from BA today — out of China, no less! 
 Boeing's 737 MAX just finished a successful and safe test flight for China's aviation regulator. The beleaguered 
Boeing design is one step closer to final approval for China's skies, and Boeing hopes the 737 MAX may fly again 
by year's end. Hoorah, hooray. 
 Things ain't too shabby stateside either: Boeing just won a $23.8 billion follow-up contract[3] with the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) to service a fleet of 275 C-17 Globemaster IIIs over the next decade. 
 Sure, some cheapskate airlines balked at Boeing's prices — cough Ryanair cough[4] — but you bet the DoD 
already has its checkbook at the ready. 
Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies
 All told, BA rallied 4% as the laundry list of news items unfurled yesterday, ending in a hangover today as BA 
slipped 2%. But why? We've got great news from Boeing, and clearly, some BA investors cheered the DoD/China 
news. What gives? 
The first and most obvious reason why Boeing is down today is because it was up yesterday. Any positivity about 
Boeing can't last longer than a few hours, it seems. And like I said with the Ryanair rant-fest, BA is everybody's 
whipping boy these days. 
 But the other reason why BA sank lower today is because, as positive analysts might be about the return of air 
traffic, travelers are only half the equation for Boeing. Airlines have quite a bit to do with how soon Boeing can take 
off from here. Oh yeah, they exist. 
 And as the analysts at Bernstein put it: 'The story is not totally clean.' 
 We're in a spot where airlines are dealing with increasing air traffic and need new planes but they're still facing a 
balance sheet disaster — some airlines worse than others. That kinda happens when you spend the pandemic 
retiring older planes and then selling others for quick cash. 
 Airlines will continue to try to upgrade and update their fleets while also cutting debt and minimizing cash burn. You 
throw in a little interest rate worrying and your typical inflation concerns, and financing a bunch of new planes 
suddenly gets a bit trickier. 
 Such is the balancing act airlines must play now. They will need Boeing for more planes to keep up with increasing 
air traffic — this much is true. 
 Thing is, Boeing's found itself in the same holding pattern many a time before. Sent airborne by uplifting news and 
dashing back down into the tarmac when Negative Nancies chime in. Don't believe me? Back on November 18, 
2020[5] — before Great Stuff Picks even recommended the stock — we said: 
With the FAA's clearance, Boeing can ramp up 737 MAX production rates again to meet existing and future orders. 
The pandemic won't be around forever. Demand for airplanes will rise again, and Boeing's path forward was just 
cleared. 
Sounds familiar, no? With new clearance (hopefully) coming soon in China, the company can ramp up production 
again, deliver more of its existing inventory to the airlines and keep on keeping on. 
Boeing's been here before. We've been here before as BA investors. Boeing will be OK. (We'll be OK too, for what 
it's worth.) 
 Domestic airlines will figure out what the heck to do with their fleets. And getting the 737 MAX back airborne in 
China would do wonders on Boeing's international sales front. 
 So same as it ever was? 
 Same as it ever was, Great Ones. The bottom line you need to remember, especially if you're holding BA is this: 
Boeing can and will take us high enough eventually. 
 The variable in question these days is less about regulatory holdups with the 737 MAX (the 787 Dreamliner we'll 
get to another day) and more about airlines ponying up enough cash to buy, buy, buy. 
 As such, today's minute drop in BA stock is nothing to worry or write home about. If anything, the market just 
offered you yet another opportunity to snatch up BA stock on the cheap. Lucky you! 
 That said, you should write home to us here in the inbox. Let me know if you're saying goodnight to holding BA, or 
if you'd live and die for the OG planemaker over at GreatStuffToday@BanyanHill.com [6].; 
 Editor's Note: Biggest Investment Opportunity Since The Internet Boom? 
 Research suggests that 916 of the Fortune 1000 companies are rushing to invest in the biggest tech opportunity of 
this century[7]. 
 Ian King calls this technology 'Digitarium.' Right now, hardly anyone knows about this trend, but mark my words: In 
just a few short years, Digitarium will become as common as the internet. 
 And there's one small company in California at the center of it all.

 Supply Chain Slip 'N Slide[9] 
Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies
 I've 
always 
wondered 
what 
the 
'beyond' 
part 
of 
Bed 
Bath 
&#38; 
Beyond 
(Nasdaq: 
BBBYhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ%3ABBBY) stood for, and now we know: 
beyond-poor earnings. 
 BBBY investors woke up with a migraine this morning after the company slashed both its revenue and earnings 
projections for the rest of the year, following disappointing fiscal second-quarter results. 
 The big-box behemoth reported a profit of $0.04 per share, missing analysts' expectations of a $0.52 per-share 
profit. Sales? Also a letdown — revenue came in at $1.99 billion versus the $2.06 billion that Wall Street 
anticipated. 
 But where did things go so horribly wrong over at Bed Bath &#38; Beyond?  
 I'm glad you asked! According to company execs, this latest earnings misfire can all be blamed on COVID-19-
induced supply chain issues and it definitely has nothing to do with its wildly overpriced inventory. 
 But wait! According to CEO Mark Tritton, this latest earnings miss isn't something that Wall Street should worry 
about long term: 'While results this quarter were below expectations, we remain confident in our multiyear 
transformation.' 
 I mean, what else is Tritton going to say? Business is down because no one wants to pay $50 for a shower caddy 
that Target sells for half the price? Nah It's much easier to blame Wall Street's favorite scapegoat: COVID-19. At 
least, that's Bed Bath &#38; Beyond's story and it's sticking to it. 
 CarMaxed Out[10] 
 There 
are 
plenty 
of 
reasons 
why 
CarMax 
(NYSE: 
KMXhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NYSE%3AKMX) made it onto our shortlist of Great Stuff 
Picks: No-pressure car searching, no hidden fees, an impressive omnichannel that makes it easy to buy cars online 
as well as in person. The list goes on. 
 Unfortunately, come earnings season, Wall Street's expectations are the only thing that really matter. And this 
quarter, Wall Street didn't get the news it wanted despite CarMax's strong sales growth. Here's a quick rundown of 
CarMax's recent performance: 
 Net revenue came in at $8 billion, up 48.7% compared to this time last year. Wholesale units increased 41.4% to 
188,098 vehicles, also up from the year prior. Used-car sales increased 6.7%, up from 6.2% a year ago. 
 Well then, what gives? All that sounds pretty good to me!  
 As it should. The real sticking point were those pesky per-share earnings. Wall Street wanted earnings of $1.87 a 
share, and instead, it got $1.72 per share. So, weak-handed KMX investors had a fit and threw the baby out with 
the bathwater. 
 But here's the thing: People are already hooked on the haggle-free car-buying experience that companies like 
CarMax and Carvana (NYSE: CVNAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=CVNA&#38;checkSymbol=false) 
provide. That was true before the COVID-19 pandemic, and it will remain true once life gets back to normal 
whenever that is. 
 No offense to any of you used-car salesmen (salespeople?) out there, but I'll scour the onlines for a new car any 
day of the week over traipsing through a labyrinthian car lot. And no, I will not upgrade to the all-weather floor mats, 
thank you very much. 
 We get it. You like CarMax. Get to the point.  
 The point is this: Any of you Great Ones looking to add KMX stock to your portfolio can view today's 10% stock 
decline as a buying opportunity. If you already own CarMax, keep holding. How's that for brevity? 
Virgin Victorious?[11] 
 The billionaire space race will undoubtedly heat up again now that Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic (NYSE: 
SPCEhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NYSE%3ASPCE) has been cleared for takeoff by the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
 If you haven't kept up with Branson's almost-a-spaceflight company, Virgin Galactic found itself in hot water with 
the FAA back on July 11 after its Unity 22 rocket veered off course in its final descent back down to Earth. 
 The problem wasn't so much the deviation itself — you try slinging a 15,800-pound rocket into 'space' and see if it 
sticks a perfect landing — but rather that Virgin Galactic failed to report said deviation to the FAA. 
 It's kinda like when one of your kids swears they didn't draw on the bathroom wall in permanent marker even 
though they've got black ink smudges all over their hands and clothes. Same maturity level, very different 
repercussions. 
Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies
 But after being grounded for the better part of a month, Virgin Galactic made peace with the FAA and promised to 
provide 'real-time mission notifications' during future flights. Because somehow that wasn't a requirement in the first 
place 
 Anyway, SPCE investors rejoiced over the news that their beloved Branson spacecrafts could take to the stars 
once more. Virgin Galactic stock rocketed 12% higher today, proving once again that investor sentiment remains 
the No. 1 mover of stock prices — and not things like future profitability or revenue growth. 
 As we pointed out back in May[12], Virgin Galactic already has 600 reservations lined up from wannabe astronauts 
eager to see space. But each of those reservations is already paid for so where is the future revenue supposed to 
come from? Until that profitability is accounted for, we'll continue giving Virgin Galactic a wide berth. 
 Lordstown's Lucky Strike[13] 
 Electric 
pickup 
truck 
maker 
Lordstown 
Motors 
(Nasdaq: 
RIDEhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ%3ARIDE) showed signs of life this morning 
after rumors circulated that Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group might acquire its sole Ohio-based electric vehicle 
(EV) factory. 
 The buyout is a boon to unlucky Lordstown, which is still struggling to raise enough cash to produce its first all-
electric pickup truck, the 'Endurance.' 
 Ah yes, here comes a witty Lordstown joke about the company lacking the endurance to make the Endurance.  
 You know us too well. Putting aside Lordstown's recent financial troubles, the company's also faced scrutiny from 
the SEC over its summertime SPAC merger with blank check company DiamondPeak Holding Corp. 
 Apparently, ex-CEO Steve Burns lied about how many orders Lordstown received for the Endurance before going 
public, as well as where those orders came from. Not great, Bob![14] 
 While Foxconn's buyout may help Lordstown's lackeys in the interim, there's no telling whether the move will be 
enough to save Lordstown from the gallows. So if rising RIDE shares piqued your interest this morning, keep one 
hand on the emergency brake and prepare for a quick getaway. 
 In other EV news the surge in EV demand is also creating a surge in the materials critical to having these EVs 
come off the assembly line. 
 There's only one company in the entire Western Hemisphere that supplies this critical material on such a large 
scale. And as EVs take over roadways all across America they will rely on this material for future success.

with Jet2Holidays reporting a 250% increase in reservations. Direct bookings have also increased its market share 
by 10% in 2020. The figures show considerable faith by UK travellers to book directly with providers, including two 
of the UK's larger tour operators. According to a recent GlobalData survey, 48% of people would prefer to book 
directly with a supplier, whereas only 16% would book with an OTA. 
Ultimately, the shift away from OTAs will increase pressure on this sector. Lessons must be learned from the 
pandemicHousehold brand names such as Onthebeach, Teletext Holidays and lastminute.com have received 
negative press over untimely refunds and legal battles during the pandemic. Furthermore, low-cost airline Ryanair 
has added fuel to the fire by accusing OTAs of providing fake details to pay for flights and adding excessive fees 
within its direct booking campaign. Unfortunately, negative press stories continue to damage the reputations of UK-
based OTAs, resulting in a fall in confidence to book in this way. According to GlobalData Q1 2021 consumer 
survey, 51% of UK respondents said they were either 'always' or 'often' influenced by a product's trustworthiness, 
highlighting how problematic the negative press could be towards OTAs. To win back customers, OTAs must 
refocus on providing quality customer service. Lessons must be learned from past issues. For many OTAs, there 
was a lack of crisis management during the pandemic, with customers left confused about their refund rights amid 
changing travel restrictions. While an unprecedented time that was almost impossible to predict, tour operators and 
direct accommodation providers better supported their bookings during the pandemic. These businesses offered 
flexibility, reassurance, and communication which was important to travellers. This reflects the change in consumer 
preference. Customers need more information and reassurance and in many instances booking direct provides this. 
The UK's top tour operators have tackled demand for direct bookings better than OTAs through quality information, 
guidance, and equally flexible booking options. For example, Jet2holidays has provided specific step-by-step 
instructions regarding red, amber and green destinations (and soon the new travel rules), as well as providing 
UK OTAs must focus on a service-led strategy post-pandemic
flexible changes and cancellations. High-quality customer service is vitalQuality customer service and 
communication will now be key to survival in the pandemic recovery. Building on strong supplier relations, 
operational restructure and creating an agile business will also be important. Strategic marketing and highlighting 
the processes in place will support the return of custom. However, the question remains as to whether OTAs have 
what it takes to win back consumer demand and compete with tour operators and direct bookings.

Highlight: Ryanair has announced an investment of $200m in Ireland's Cork Airport (ORK), reopening its two-
aircraft base at the airport and restoring all pre-Covid flights from the third quarter of 2022.
Body
With this investment, the Irish carrier will bring 20 routes to Cork Airport, including new services to Birmingham and 
Edinburgh that were originally operated by Stobart Air before its recent collapse. For the past several months, Cork 
Airport and the DAA have been working with Ryanair to extend the traffic recovery scheme until October next year 
to incentivise Ryanair's traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels. 
The scheme's extension is said to secure 60 Ryanair jobs. Ryanair Designated Activity Company (DAC) CEO Eddie 
Wilson said: "Ryanair is delighted to confirm the reopening of its two-aircraft base at Cork Airport. "This $200m 
investment secures 60 Ryanair jobs at Cork, but, more importantly, restores passenger traffic at Cork to pre-
pandemic levels for summer 2022. "Cork, along with Shannon, Kerry and Knock, have had their Ryanair traffic fully 
restored to pre-pandemic levels of capacity ensuring the recovery of tourism, jobs and connectivity." Cork Airport 
managing director Niall MacCarthy said: "I am delighted with today's announcement by Ryanair reopening their 
base at Cork Airport in December. "Twenty routes on sale from Cork Airport on the Ryanair website will ensure that 
Christmas 2021, spring and summer 2022 contains lots of travel options for our passengers. "Outbound sun and 
city breaks and inbound visitors from the UK and Continental Europe is good news for jobs in aviation, tourism and 
hospitality and the rebound of our economy in 2022."

 Ryanair (RYA.L) is set to appeal a ruling issued by a court in Luxembourg, which upholds the European 
Commission's order for the Irish airline to pay back funds received as illegal aid from an airport in Austria, Reuters

There is "no question of the lights going out" this winter, Britain's business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng promised 
MPs, ominously, as gas prices jumped. "There will be no three-day weeks or a throwback to the 1970s."
All of Europe is fretting about energy bills. Electricity prices are soaring for various reasons, including the post-
vaccination economic rebound and a temporary gas shortage. Longer-term, though, consumers will increasingly 
butt up against a force whose very purpose is to keep fossil fuels expensive: carbon taxes. The EU's carbon price 
has doubled in a year to a nearrecord (EURO)60 a tonne; Britain's is higher still, at £56.14. Carbon taxes are 
already hastening the phasing out of coal, making gas even pricier.
We need carbon taxes. They are arguably our most cost-effective weapon if we're going to have even a theoretical 
chance of cutting emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. But the moment carbon pricing actually raises the price of 
carbon, it will terrify politicians. Carbon pricing versus voters' wallets is the next political battle of our time.
Until now, carbon taxes have been designed to be toothless. Even Sweden, which levies the world's highest, has 
cannily exempted entire categories of polluters. Globally, only about a fifth of emissions are covered by carbon 
prices. Just 4 per cent are covered by a carbon tax of at least $40 a tonne - the minimum rate that might be 
compatible with the goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2 degrees. In fact, a tax rate of 
(EURO)120 a tonne would be "more in line with recent estimates of overall social carbon costs", reckons the 
OECD, the richcountry club. Carbon pricing as it stands isn't climate action; it's just virtue-signalling. Any

government trying to get more ambitious hits resistance. The uprising of France's gilets jaunes in 2018 sank 
Emmanuel Macron's attempt to hike fuel prices by a few cents per litre.
Politicians are right to be scared, because higher carbon taxes will hurt. Even if there's no hit to economic growth, 
spending will shift from consumption to investment. Gone will be that £19 London-Mallorca return flight on Ryanair. 
Our clothes, petrol, meat and coffee will all get pricier. We'll need to send an army of workers around the rich 
world's houses ripping out boilers, installing heat pumps and insulating attics. The felt benefit to homeowners will be 
rather less than when our greatgrandparents got toilets and central heating. There will be new green jobs, but these 
might not pacify newly unemployed airline stewards, car-plant workers and coal miners.
Still, carbon taxes are finally going mainstream. In July, China launched the world's biggest national emissions-
trading scheme, while the European Commission proposed a carbon price on car fuel and heating for buildings. 
Even Canada's Conservatives now back carbon taxes (provided they are harmlessly priced). The UN's climate 
change summit in Glasgow in November will generate a new global push. But many voters won't like it: much as 
they enjoy virtuesignalling, it's not clear they want action. The galvanising effect of this summer's climate disasters 
has already faded: July's German floods are no longer expected to benefit the Greens in Sunday's elections.
Given that realistic carbon taxes will be unpopular, how best to introduce them? Macron did the world a favour by 
test-running the least appealing version imaginable. His fuel tax had its biggest impact on an underprivileged group: 
poorer suburbanites and rural people who rely on cars. It offered them no alternative: where they lived, they couldn't 
switch to public transport or bikes. It was introduced without consultation. It let off the rich: there was no comparable 
levy on, say, business-class flights. And proceeds went into the opaque national budget.
It would be fairly simple to design a smarter carbon tax. The consultancy Climate Focus has some tips. First, pay

There is "no question of the lights going out" this winter, Britain's business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng promised 
MPs, ominously, as gas prices jumped. "There will be no three-day weeks or a throwback to the 1970s."
All of Europe is fretting about energy bills. Electricity prices are soaring for various reasons, including the post-
vaccination economic rebound and a temporary gas shortage. Longer-term, though, consumers will increasingly 
butt up against a force whose very purpose is to keep fossil fuels expensive: carbon taxes. The EU's carbon price 
has doubled in a year to a nearrecord (EURO)60 a tonne; Britain's is higher still, at £56.14. Carbon taxes are 
already hastening the phasing out of coal, making gas even pricier.
We need carbon taxes. They are arguably our most cost-effective weapon if we're going to have even a theoretical 
chance of cutting emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. But the moment carbon pricing actually raises the price of 
carbon, it will terrify politicians. Carbon pricing versus voters' wallets is the next political battle of our time.
Until now, carbon taxes have been designed to be toothless. Even Sweden, which levies the world's highest, has 
cannily exempted entire categories of polluters. Globally, only about a fifth of emissions are covered by carbon 
prices. Just 4 per cent are covered by a carbon tax of at least $40 a tonne - the minimum rate that might be 
compatible with the goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2 degrees. In fact, a tax rate of 
(EURO)120 a tonne would be "more in line with recent estimates of overall social carbon costs", reckons the 
OECD, the richcountry club. Carbon pricing as it stands isn't climate action; it's just virtue-signalling. Any

government trying to get more ambitious hits resistance. The uprising of France's gilets jaunes in 2018 sank 
Emmanuel Macron's attempt to hike fuel prices by a few cents per litre.
Politicians are right to be scared, because higher carbon taxes will hurt. Even if there's no hit to economic growth, 
spending will shift from consumption to investment. Gone will be that £19 London-Mallorca return flight on Ryanair. 
Our clothes, petrol, meat and coffee will all get pricier. We'll need to send an army of workers around the rich 
world's houses ripping out boilers, installing heat pumps and insulating attics. The felt benefit to homeowners will be 
rather less than when our greatgrandparents got toilets and central heating. There will be new green jobs, but these 
might not pacify newly unemployed airline stewards, car-plant workers and coal miners.
Still, carbon taxes are finally going mainstream. In July, China launched the world's biggest national emissions-
trading scheme, while the European Commission proposed a carbon price on car fuel and heating for buildings. 
Even Canada's Conservatives now back carbon taxes (provided they are harmlessly priced). The UN's climate 
change summit in Glasgow in November will generate a new global push. But many voters won't like it: much as 
they enjoy virtuesignalling, it's not clear they want action. The galvanising effect of this summer's climate disasters 
has already faded: July's German floods are no longer expected to benefit the Greens in Sunday's elections.
Given that realistic carbon taxes will be unpopular, how best to introduce them? Macron did the world a favour by 
test-running the least appealing version imaginable. His fuel tax had its biggest impact on an underprivileged group: 
poorer suburbanites and rural people who rely on cars. It offered them no alternative: where they lived, they couldn't 
switch to public transport or bikes. It was introduced without consultation. It let off the rich: there was no comparable 
levy on, say, business-class flights. And proceeds went into the opaque national budget.
It would be fairly simple to design a smarter carbon tax. The consultancy Climate Focus has some tips. First, pay 
out the proceeds, especially to poorer people, so that voters come to think of carbon pricing as a dividend as well 
as a tax. In Switzerland, every recipient receives a compensation payment through the health-insurance system,

Still, carbon taxes are finally going mainstream.
In July, China launched the world's biggest national emissions trading scheme, while the European Commission 
proposed a carbon price on car fuel and heating for buildings. Even Canada's Conservatives now back carbon 
taxes (provided they are harmlessly priced). The UN's climate change summit in Glasgow in November will 
generate a new global push. But many voters won't like it: much as they enjoy virtue signalling, it's not clear they 
want action. The galvanising effect of this summer's climate disasters has already faded: July's floods in Germany 
are no longer expected to benefit the Greens in Sunday's German elections.
Given that realistic carbon taxes will be unpopular, how best to introduce them? Macron did the world a favour by 
test-running the least appealing version imaginable. The fuel tax had its biggest impact on an underprivileged 
group: poorer suburbanites and rural people reliant on cars. It offered them no alternative: where they lived, they 
couldn't switch to public transport or bikes. It was introduced without consultation. It exempted the rich: there was 
no comparable levy on business-class flights. And proceeds went into the opaque national budget.
It would be fairly simple to design a smarter carbon tax. The consultancy Climate Focus has some tips. First, pay 
out the proceeds, especially to poorer people, so that voters come to think of carbon pricing as a dividend as well 
as a tax. In Switzerland, every recipient receives compensation through the health insurance system, with a letter 
explaining "why you are receiving XY francs". Second, governments must offer people non-polluting alternatives. 
One model is London, where the £15 daily congestion charge on drivers goes partly into public transport. Third: 
give people ownership of a carbon tax by consulting them first. Get them enthused about a shared mission.
Harry Haysom
France is belatedly laying the ground for making carbon more expensive. To pacify the gilets jaunes, Macron held a 
"grand débat national", which included more than 10,000 public gatherings and 1.5m individual contributions on 
how to achieve the "ecological transition". France is building cycle lanes and 68 metro stations in Paris's suburbs. 
Once they exist, carbon taxes will feel fairer. My most confident prediction remains that global temperatures will rise 
by more than 2 "degrees" while we barely even pretend to do anything. But we could at least try.

UK advertising regulator to crack down on false greenwashing claims
UK advertising regulator to crack down on false greenwashing claims

Body
The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) will release new guidance to crack down on false greenwashing 
claims.
The body will set out key principles so ads don't mislead people about the environment and are socially responsible 
when considering environmental issues.
READ: Greenwashing: UK firms to face crackdown next year
The ASA will also start a series of enquiries into high-polluting sectors, such as aviation, cars, waste, animal-based 
foods and heating. The focus will initially be on energy, heating and transport issues. It will work with the 
Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on their current enquiry into green energy tariff reform.
In spring 2022, the ASA will look into waste and how products are described as 'recyclable'/'recycling', 
'biodegradable'/'compostable' or 'plastic alternatives', followed by food ads later next year.
Another key area will be electric vehicles and how they are associated with carbon neutral and net-zero claims.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) came under fire in early 2020 after it claims that it was the airline with the lowest 
emissions.
The ASA banned an advert as it was based on data from 2011 and labelled it as misleading.
UK advertising regulator to crack down on false greenwashing claims
Royal Dutch Shell PLC (LSE:RDSB) had a similar experience in 2008, when it said that a massive oil refinery in 
Texas and a Canadian tar sands project were "sustainable". ASA said that was misleading as there wasn't enough 
evidence to show the emissions from these activities were reduced.

BA axes plan to create low-cost hub at Gatwick; Airlines Pilots' union fails to 
back launch of short-haul rival to easyJet and Ryanair

British Airways has scrapped plans to create a low-cost subsidiary based at Gatwick airport after a pilots' union 
failed to support the proposal, in a blow for its ambitions to challenge rivals Ryanair and easyJet as the industry 
emerges from the pandemic.
BA, owned by International Airlines Group, said it was "disappointed" plans to turn its short-haul operations into low-
cost ones at the UK's second busiest airport had failed to gain backing from the British Airline Pilots' Association.
"After many years of losing money on European flights from the airport, we were clear that coming out of the 
pandemic, we needed a plan to make Gatwick profitable and competitive," it said in a statement.
"With regret, we will now suspend our short-haul operations at Gatwick, with the exception of a small number of 
domestic services connecting to our long-haul operation, and will pursue alternative uses for the London Gatwick 
short-haul slots."
Martin Chalk, acting general secretary at Balpa, said "despite our best efforts" the union had been unable to reach 
an agreement with BA on "revised terms and conditions for London Gatwick (LGW) short-haul, that was acceptable 
to our members".
BA axes plan to create low-cost hub at Gatwick Airlines Pilots' union fails to back launch of short-haul rival to 
easyJet and Ryanair
Balpa, he added, remained "open to future negotiations" with BA to address members' concerns with the proposals 
"for LGW short-haul or about any other part of the business".
It comes only a month after the plans were first announced by BA in what would have been an attempt to restore 
passenger numbers next summer as airlines recover from the pandemic.
BA operates 47 short-haul routes from Gatwick that have been on hold since spring 2020 due to Covid-19, 
according to Cirium, a travel analytics firm.
The airline is scheduled to run about 1,880 flights from Gatwick in July next year and a potential withdrawal would 
leave the airport without services to Algiers, Cologne Bonn, Genoa and Manchester. In an email sent to BA pilots 
and seen by the Financial Times, it said pilots would have remained BA employees if they moved to the subsidiary 
and acknowledged the "journey to recovery is going to be slow".
"We believed we could build a competitive BA branded short-haul operation out of Gatwick. But to make this 
happen, we would have to turn a lossmaking operation into a profitable one," it added.
It is the latest in a string of attempts by BA to venture into Europe's low-cost airline market, which is dominated by 
budget airlines Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet.
In 1998, the company founded Go Fly, which operated flights between London Stansted and Europe before being 
taken over by easyJet four years later.
IAG and Europe's other leading airlines have been hit hard by the pandemic, the worst crisis in the history of 
aviation, as it brought international travel to a halt. IAG revenues plummeted 70 per cent year on year to 
(EURO)1.1bn in the second quarter as airlines under its umbrella flew just 22 per cent of their pre-pandemic flight 
schedules. Additional reporting by Sylvia Pfeifer

Airline bosses clash over post- Covid mergers

RYANAIR'S boss yesterday doubled down on his point that rivals Easyjet and Wizz Air will not survive as 
independent airlines without a merger.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said it would be a "sensible development" for his rivals to merge in the future and 
there was industry-consensus there would be "more consolidation across Europe" post-Covid-19.
"I'm not sure if Wizz or Easyjet can survive as independent airlines because they're not able to compete with 
Ryanair on cost," O'Leary said, speaking on Sky News.
If they did not merge together, they were likely to merge with other airlines, the CEO added.
"(It is) complete nonsense," EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren shot back at his Irish rival later in the day: "I would urge 
anyone who runs an airline to focus on their own business rather than speculate about others, (where) they have no 
idea about what's going on."
He said Easyjet was not opposed in principle to consolidation carried out in the form of external transactions.
"We are not against any M&A type of activity but it needs to be able to deliver value for shareholders and to deliver 
a reason to believe in a successful outcome," he said.
Lundgren was asked whether the airline saw itself as a buyer in any future shake-out of the European industry. "We 
would be looking at companies, as I am sure companies would be looking at us. There is no drama around that at 
all," he said.
Airline bosses clash over post- Covid mergers
Easyjet rejected a takeover approach from Wizz Air that would have created a low-cost airline to rival Ryanair, 
opting instead to raise $1.7bn from shareholders.
"It's like a family or a marriage, we differ from time to time," Ryanair's O'Leary said yesterday.
He said the most important thing was "good, healthy competition" as it results in customers getting the best deal.
The airline had seen "extraordinary" numbers of bookings to popular destinations including the Canary Islands and 
Portugal for the October half-term.
O'Leary welcomed a simplification of international travel rules, after ministers scrapped the travel light system for 
different countries.

Sep 23, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] raised its 5-year traffic growth forecast from 33% to 50%. The 
European carrier now expects traffic to grow to more than 225 million guests per year by March 2026 compared 
with 200 million predicted earlier. 
The Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[2] was also in the news in the past week when it extended its 
agreement with American Airlines AAL[3]. American Airlines will acquire a 5.2% stake in Gol Linhas. However, 
American Airlines' alliance with JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] seems to have run into rough weather with the Justice 
Department and officials in six states reportedly [5]filing a lawsuit against the alliance on antitrust grounds. Recap of 
the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1.Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects fiscal 2022 
traffic in the range of 90-100 million compared with 27.5 million guests in fiscal 2021.The carrier aims to take 
delivery of 210 Boeing 737 aircraft over the next five years. The company expects these planes, which would lower 
costs and reduce emissions, to accelerate its post-COVID growth[6]. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
2. Under this extended deal, Gol Linhas will receive an equity investment of $200 million (R$1.05 billion) from 
American Airlines. This additional liquidity is expected to strengthen Gol Linhas' balance sheet. The new agreement 
expands beyond the terms of the existing codeshare partnership (which has been in place since February 2020) 
between the carriers. As a result of the code sharing pact, passengers of either carrier can purchase tickets of the 
connecting flights using one reservation. American Airlines, through this exclusive codeshare agreement, expects to 
increase commercial cooperation with the Brazilian carrier to accelerate growth and create a more seamless 
experience for customers[8]. 
3. According to an update from the White House, travel restrictions on air passengers from countries like China, 
India, Britain and other European nations into the United States will be eased from November this year. Per White 
House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients, foreign nationals will have to be fully vaccinated when they fly to the 
United States in November. They will have to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding. Further, the 
travelers have to test negative for the coronavirus, which they have to undergo within three days of their flight. 
Zients ruled out the need to quarantine for the fully-vaccinated passengers[9]. 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Bullish View for Traffic, AAL , JBLU in Focus
The development is a major positive, especially for the Delta-variant-hit U.S. airlines. Many of the carriers expect 
third-quarter 2021 results to be dented by the spread of the Delta strain in the United States. Their bearish third-
quarter views were discussed in detail in the previous week's write-up[10]. 
4. The Justice Department believes that the alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue will reduce 
competition, leading to higher fares. Per Attorney General Merrick Garland, 'In an industry where just four airlines 
control more than 80% of domestic air travel, American Airlines' alliance with JetBlue is, in fact, an unprecedented 
manoeuvre to further consolidate the industry." 
American and JetBlue vowed to fight the lawsuit and continue with their alliance unless directed otherwise by a 
court. The partnership was announced last year. JetBlue and American Airlines already started coordinating on 
flights in the Northeast. Garland is, however, of the view that 'It would result in higher fares, fewer choices, and 
lower quality service if allowed to continue.' 
5. United Airlines UAL[11] is expanding its footprint in Africa with a new service between Washington, D.C. and 
Lagos, Nigeria, set to be launched on Nov 29, subject to government approval. The airline will operate three weekly 
flights between the U.S. capital and the popular African destination. This is the company's first ever nonstop service 
between Washington, D.C. and Nigeria[12]. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of 
the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, aided by the 
announcement from the White House pertaining to the easing of international travel curbs. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has increased 3.5% over the past week to $94.23. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has 
decreased 6.6%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will await more updates on the American Airlines-
JetBlue partnership in the coming days.

Advertising watchdog to launch crackdown on ads falsely claiming green credentials
Advertising watchdog to launch crackdown on ads falsely claiming green 
credentials

 Airline ads that encourage taking too many flights and carmakers that show SUVs tearing up the countryside are 
set to fall foul of a crackdown on marketing that encourages environmentally irresponsible behaviour. 
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is to launch a series of inquiries into the environmental advertising 
claims and practices across a range of sectors - starting with energy, heating and transport - in a drive to support 
global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and battle the climate crisis. 
 Next spring the the watchdog will expand its investigation to look at the accuracy of green claims made by 
companies around waste, such as products being biodegradable, recyclable or a 'plastic alternative'. Later next 
year the spotlight will turn to meat and food sustainability advertising, for example checking the accuracy of claims 
around environmental good practice by sellers of beef products, a hugely carbon intensive industry. 
 'The ASA is going to be shining a greater regulatory spotlight in the coming years on social responsibility and 
misleadingness issues when it comes to environmental claims in ads,' says Miles Lockwood, director of complaints 
and investigations at the ASA. 
 'We know that there needs to be systemic, wide scale change in order for the UK to meet the government's climate 
targets. We know how concerned people are about ads inaccurately promoting green credentials. We believe that 
our work will continue to positively influence the fight against climate change.' 
 It will also commission research into what the public understands by terms such as 'carbon neutral' and 'net zero' in 
order to inform its policing of claims. It will examine the messaging around the meaning of 'hybrid' in the burgeoning 
electric vehicle market. 
 'We have concerns about how companies might be using 'green' terms,' said Lockwood. 'Carbon neutral in 
particular is emerging as a popular term, with lots of companies burnishing their green credentials by claiming their 
services add no carbon overall to the atmosphere. 
 'We want to better understand how companies are using terms like this across industries and how consumers 
understand these terms, so that our rules and guidance are in step with prevailing academic, scientific evidence 
and environmental standards so we're best placed to tackle misleading and socially irresponsible green claims 
across media.' 
Advertising watchdog to launch crackdown on ads falsely claiming green credentials
 The watchdog has clamped down on several major companies in recent years over their green claims in adverts, 
including Ryanair - which got caught using outdated information to claim it was the UK's lowest emission airline - 
BMW and Shell. 
 The ASA is currently investigating complaints about a Land Rover Defender advert that shows one of the vehicles 
driving through a forest accompanied by the slogan 'life is so much better without restrictions'. The complaints claim 
the advert encourages an irresponsible approach to nature and fails to mention the climate impact of SUVs. 
 Later this year, the ASA's sister body the Committee of Advertising Practice - which sets the UK advertising code 
across all forms of media, from TV and newspapers to billboards and online - will issue new guidance to advertisers 
regarding misleading and socially irresponsible environmental claims and advertising. 
 On Monday, the Competition and Markets Authority said it would launch its own review of misleading green claims 
next year.

 EasyJet (EZJ.L) Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said Ryanair's (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) boss should focus on 
running his own airline instead of speculating about others, Reuters reported Tuesday.
The comments came after Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said that EasyJet and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) would either 
need to merge or be acquired following the COVID-19 pandemic
Lundgren called O'Leary's statement "complete nonsense" but noted that the company was "not against any M&A 
type of activity."
EasyJet recently rejected an unsolicited takeover offer from Hungary-based Wizz Air saying it undervalued the 
airline, and instead outlined plans to raise about 1.2 billion pounds sterling ($1.64 billion) through a rights issue to 
support its pandemic recovery.

Boeing : Still Losing Ground to Airbus

Sep 21, 2021( GuruFocus.com: http://www.gurufocus.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 When deliveries of the 737 MAX 8 first began in May 2017, it seemed to mark the start of a promising new era for 
the Boeing Co. ( BA[1], Financial[2]). Unfortunately, that bright vision of the future was darkened in 2019 by the 
revelation that the next-generation passenger aircraft suffered from a critical design flaw, one that had already 
resulted in the catastrophic crashes of two planes. Grounded from May 2019 to December 2020, the 737 MAX was 
transformed from a profitable buoy for Boeing's fortunes into a painful and costly millstone. While Boeing has 
managed to put much of the 737 MAX crisis behind it, the stain on its brand has proved slow to fade. Despite its 
subsequent return to service, lingering distrust of the 737 MAX design has continued to weigh on sales, with signs 
of growing willingness among airlines to consider rival Airbus SE ( XPAR:AIR[3], Financial[4]). All of this has raised 
the question: can Boeing continue to hold the line against its European rival? Hopeful summer rays give way to 
autumnal gloom 
There were some promising signs for the 737 MAX during the summer months of 2021. In June, Boeing received 
orders for the aircraft to the tune of 219 units, 200 of which came from a single buyer, United Airlines Holdings Inc. 
( UAL[5], Financial[6]). Unfortunately, there was little apparent momentum heading into July, which saw Boeing add 
19 aircraft to its 737 MAX order tally. That result barely moved the needle overall, however, coming as it did 
alongside 15 cancellations. August, meanwhile, was a decent showing for Boeing, seeing 35 net new orders and 14 
deliveries of the 737 MAX. That brought Boeing's 737 MAX delivery total to 169 since the aircraft returned to 
service last December. Complicating matters further in August was the rising prospect of Chinese economic issues 
ranging from an incipient domestic debt crisis to mounting international trade tensions. 
September thus far has offered fresh cause for concern, especially its failure to come to terms with Ryanair ( 
LSE:RYA[7], Financial[8]) for the sale of dozens of 737 MAX aircraft. On Sept. 6, Ryanair made a rare public 
announcement that it had decided to walk away from the months-long negotiation, having failed to come to terms 
with Boeing on price. Remarkably, Ryanair abandoned talks despite its stated need for as many as 250 equivalent 
aircraft. Had Boeing been able to secure the full order, it could have raked in more than $30 billion from the deal. 
Given that Ryanair has been Boeing's top 737 MAX customer to date, I find it hard to interpret the result as anything 
other than a serious blow for Boeing. Boeing's loss may be Airbus's gain 
Overall, Boeing has lost considerable ground to Airbus in the battle over aircraft manufacturing supremacy. As 
CNBC reported on Sept. 14, Boeing's deliveries have badly lagged those of its European rival all year: 
Boeing : Still Losing Ground to Airbus
'For the year to date, Boeing has delivered 206 aircraft. European rival Airbus delivered 40 jets in August to bring 
supplies of its new jets to 384 since the start of the year, remaining broadly on course to meet an annual goal of 
600 deliveries, which would preserve its crown as the No. 1 aircraft manufacturer.' 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Airbus has been the biggest beneficiary of Boeing's recent woes. In August, Airbus beat out 
Boeing for a 16-aircraft order from Condor, a niche leisure airline. In September, longtime Boeing stalwart Jet2 
publicly changed allegiance with a 36-plane order from Airbus worth $4.9 billion. 
While Boeing comes off a bit better on the comparative of new order book growth, it still leaves much to be desired, 
in my view. 
My take 
Boeing has struggled to restore both its reputation and finances in the wake of a cascade of crises first triggered by 
the 2019 grounding of the 737 MAX. Efforts to reestablish normalcy were stymied first by slow progress on 
recertification of the 737 MAX, and then by the severe disruptions to air travel precipitated by the lockdowns and 
travel restrictions last year. 
Despite the continued challenges facing Boeing, which admittedly extend beyond the rehabilitation of the 737 MAX, 
there is some reason to be hopeful about the name, in my assessment. The company finally broke its long streak of 
losses in the second quarter, returning to profitability after six consecutive quarterly losses. 
Boeing remains very much a work in progress, but it is one I think is worth keeping an eye on. 
Trade carefully!

collaboration and development of the Swedish market," says Elizabeth Axtelius, Director Aviation Business at 
Swedavia.

December 3, 2021.

The multi-billion-pound business of buying and selling commercial aircraft was put on hold during the Covid-19 
pandemic. But a rare public spat between Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and Boeing over the Irish airline's latest 
order of 737 Max 10 jets shows the high stakes game is sputtering back to life.
It is also a sign that the aircraft market is reviving as airlines return to the negotiating table to place orders for 
passenger jets in anticipation of the return of customers.
The pandemic has hit aviation hard, with Boeing saying the virus has cost the industry two years of growth.
The breakdown of talks with O'Leary over a new batch of Max 10 jets shows a more confident approach from the 
US manufacturer, according to industry watchers.
"It is good for the industry that Boeing is showing some price discipline. The Max is a good aircraft. They shouldn't 
be pressured by O'Leary into giving it away," John Leahy, former commercial director at Airbus, said.
Boeing has remained reticent about the disagreement with O'Leary, only noting that it valued Ryanair's business 
but had to exercise discipline.
Aircraft sales begin to take off after pandemic hiatus Aerospace & defence. Jet orders Boeing and Airbus report

A large new order for the Max would have boosted the US group as it continues to build confidence in the aircraft 
after two fatal crashes.
The company has won a series of orders this year, including for 150 of the Max 10 from United Airlines. It has also 
reduced the backlog of Max jets that had been built but did not have buyers to about a couple of dozen, according 
to market watchers.
"Over the past year or so, Boeing has been going through the friends and family of the Max and offered a good 
price to help it clear the backlog of Maxes. All existing buyers bought some more," said Rob Stallard, an analyst at 
Vertical Research Partners.
Across the industry, although the recovery in traffic is patchy, airlines have returned to ordering new planes.
Data from Ascend by Cirium, the aviation consultancy, show 902 new gross orders, which excludes cancellations 
and orders for non-commercial customers, recorded by Airbus and Boeing so far this year. This compares with 672 
orders for the whole of 2020.
North American airlines, notably United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, have led the charge this year.
"You can see the clear impact of Max orders from US majors [airlines]," said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at 
Ascend by Cirium.
Actual deliveries, however, are much lower. Over the same period, only 572 aircraft have been delivered. Marc 
Allen, chief strategy officer at Boeing, said the company's sales teams were in discussions with a "number of 
customers globally".
He added: "We are seeing demand from a number of different regions. A lot of airlines recognise that now is an 
opportunity for them to reset their planning and their fleet intentions."
Dómhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, the Irish aircraft leasing company, said the recent orders from US 
airlines in particular over the past six months were a positive sign. "It sends a message of confidence in the market 
recovery and it also sends a message of confidence in the Max," he said.
Airbus, the world's other leading jet manufacturer, recorded in August its best month for orders since the onset of 
the Covid-19 pandemic in January 2020.
The European company, which has fallen behind Boeing in order flow this year as its US rival has replenished its 
Max backlog, reported 102 gross orders for August, including large deals with Delta Air Lines and Jet2, the British 
budget airline. The UK carrier's order for 36 A321neo jets was seen as a coup for Airbus because it has traditionally 
bought from Boeing.
Airline bosses are clearly feeling more confident, too. Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, told an investor 
conference that crises also "create opportunities".
He said: "They've created a great opportunity for us to accelerate our fleet development, not just retire a lot of old 
inefficient planes, but acquire a lot of new. Not just the [Airbus] 321neos and the like, but going out into used 
markets, which we're not afraid of tapping into with some amazing bargains that will be around as a capital-friendly 
decision for years to come."
Robert Jordan, the incoming chief executive at Southwest Airlines, told the same conference that the airline 
expected 2022 to be a "big growth year in terms of net new aircraft" as it sought to restore its network after the 
pandemic.
Even in Europe, where the recovery has been slower than in the US, carriers have begun to look at renewing their 
fleets, according to an industry executive, noting that confidence had been buoyed by a strong summer.

O'Leary, well-known for his bullishness, is particularly upbeat despite the breakdown of talks with Boeing.
He told investors on Thursday that the airline's new fleet of Boeing aircraft would help to deliver a step-change in 
growth. Ryanair expects to fly more passengers than previously forecast by March 2026.
However, the air traffic revival remains tentative. Several of the largest US carriers last week revealed a slowdown 
in demand, blaming the rising cases of the contagious Delta variant of coronavirus.
Slattery has also cautioned that on a global basis it will take "at least a couple more years to where I feel we are 
truly through the worst".

A large new order for the Max would have boosted the US group as it continues to build confidence in the aircraft 
after two fatal crashes.
The company has won a series of orders this year, including for 150 of the Max 10 from United Airlines. It has also 
reduced the backlog of Max jets that had been built but did not have buyers to about a couple of dozen, according 
to market watchers.
"Over the past year or so, Boeing has been going through the friends and family of the Max and offered a good 
price to help it clear the backlog of Maxes. All existing buyers bought some more," said Rob Stallard, an analyst at 
Vertical Research Partners.
Across the industry, although the recovery in traffic is patchy, airlines have returned to ordering new planes.
Data from Ascend by Cirium, the aviation consultancy, show 902 new gross orders, which excludes cancellations 
and orders for non-commercial customers, recorded by Airbus and Boeing so far this year. This compares with 672 
orders for the whole of 2020.
North American airlines, notably United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, have led the charge this year.
"You can see the clear impact of Max orders from US majors [airlines]," said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at 
Ascend by Cirium.
Actual deliveries, however, are much lower. Over the same period, only 572 aircraft have been delivered. Marc 
Allen, chief strategy officer at Boeing, said the company's sales teams were in discussions with a "number of 
customers globally".
He added: "We are seeing demand from a number of different regions. A lot of airlines recognise that now is an 
opportunity for them to reset their planning and their fleet intentions."
Dómhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, the Irish aircraft leasing company, said the recent orders from US 
airlines in particular over the past six months were a positive sign. "It sends a message of confidence in the market 
recovery and it also sends a message of confidence in the Max," he said.
Airbus, the world's other leading jet manufacturer, recorded in August its best month for orders since the onset of 
the Covid-19 pandemic in January 2020.
The European company, which has fallen behind Boeing in order flow this year as its US rival has replenished its 
Max backlog, reported 102 gross orders for August, including large deals with Delta Air Lines and Jet2, the British 
budget airline. The UK carrier's order for 36 A321neo jets was seen as a coup for Airbus because it has traditionally 
bought from Boeing.
Airline bosses are clearly feeling more confident, too. Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, told an investor 
conference that crises also "create opportunities".
He said: "They've created a great opportunity for us to accelerate our fleet development, not just retire a lot of old 
inefficient planes, but acquire a lot of new. Not just the [Airbus] 321neos and the like, but going out into used 
markets, which we're not afraid of tapping into with some amazing bargains that will be around as a capital-friendly 
decision for years to come."
Robert Jordan, the incoming chief executive at Southwest Airlines, told the same conference that the airline 
expected 2022 to be a "big growth year in terms of net new aircraft" as it sought to restore its network after the 
pandemic.
Even in Europe, where the recovery has been slower than in the US, carriers have begun to look at renewing their 
fleets, according to an industry executive, noting that confidence had been buoyed by a strong summer.

O'Leary, well-known for his bullishness, is particularly upbeat despite the breakdown of talks with Boeing.
He told investors on Thursday that the airline's new fleet of Boeing aircraft would help to deliver a step-change in 
growth. Ryanair expects to fly more passengers than previously forecast by March 2026.
However, the air traffic revival remains tentative. Several of the largest US carriers last week revealed a slowdown 
in demand, blaming the rising cases of the contagious Delta variant of coronavirus.
Slattery has also cautioned that on a global basis it will take "at least a couple more years to where I feel we are 
truly through the worst".

Corporate person in the news
Bill Franke Indigo Partners founder
Bill Franke has spent 20 years disproving Warren Buffett's adage that airlines are a "death trap" for investors.
But as a novice private equity executive touting his first fund in 2002, he struggled to persuade big investors and 
pension funds to pour money into a notoriously cyclical and unpredictable industry.
"They were all, like, 'not in the airline industry'," Franke recalled.
Two decades on, the 84-year old Franke is considered by some to be the most successful airline investor in history 
after buying stakes in a clutch of small carriers and pushing them into rapid growth by installing the ultra-low-cost 
model pioneered by Southwest Airlines in the US and Ryanair in Europe.
While passengers often chafe at the no-frills model, which includes piling seats into aircraft and charging for add-
ons, this part of the industry is expected to emerge strengthened by the pandemic, reinforcing Franke's reputation 
further as the Buffett of the airline business.
Franke's Indigo Partners owns stakes in six airlines, including Frontier in the US, Volaris in Chile and Canada's 
Enerjet. But it is Hungarian airline Wizz Air, 40 per cent owned by Indigo and chaired by Franke, that has caught the 
imagination of a battered industry.
Buffett of the airline business is in for the long haul
Wizz hopes to use the crisis for a breakneck growth spurt, and its ambitions were underlined when an audacious 
bid for easyJet was revealed, and rejected, last week.
Franke would not discuss easyJet, but said Indigo was "actively considering opportunities" as the sector emerges 
from Covid. "It is a time for the industry to look at consolidation, and we would clearly want to be a consolidator," he 
said.
Wizz chief executive József Váradi has also been offered a £100m bonus if he can more than double the share 
price over the next five years.
"That's typical Bill," said John Leahy, the former head of sales of Airbus, who has had experience in negotiations 
with Franke as a seller of passenger jets to his airlines. "It won't pay out unless [Varadi] delivers, and if he doubles 
the stock price, then Bill is willing to share," he said.
Yet surprisingly given his success, Franke never meant to end up in the airline business.
It was not until the early 1990s, when he was in his mid-fifties, that he first took an interest in airlines after an 
approach from the Arizona state governor, who asked him to help save bankrupt America West after a successful 
but low-profile career turning round businesses in the paper and retail industries.
"I did not know up from down about Airbus or Boeing or any parts of the business ... I had to get on a fast track to 
be educated, sometimes the hard way," Franke said.
Helped by capital put up by private equity's billionaire businessman David Bonderman, the novice airline boss 
demonstrated his restructuring golden touch again, turning America West into a successful low-cost operator over 
the next decade. He then left the airline and followed his friend Bonderman into private equity, founding Indigo 
Partners in 2002.
With early backing from the Singapore wealth fund, still an investor today, the fund's investments ranged across 
continents, but were always guided by seeking assets where costs were kept low that served Franke well in his 
turnround days.
"In almost every case, the management had permitted the balance sheet to go to hell in a handcart," he said of the 
companies he restructured, something he never forgot as he hunted out investments for his new private equity fund.
Ben Baldanza, chief executive of Indigo-backed Spirit Airlines between 2005 and 2016, said: "There was a really 
good, relentless focus on costs. That's the one thing an airline can really control."
There have been missteps. Spirit, which Franke sold out of in 2013, was dogged by customer complaints about the 
no-frills model, while an investment in Russia failed. And it is difficult to determine how well Indigo, and Franke 
himself, have done at his private equity group as it discloses little financial information.
Franke would go no further than saying Indigo would be "for sure in the top 10 per cent" of the industry for returns 
over the past 20 years. He also refuses to disclose his investors, understood to include a European bank and high-
net worth individuals.
However, the group has clearly made money out of Wizz, whose share price has climbed to nearly £50 from £11.50 
in 2015 when the airline listed in London. Over that period, Indigo has slowly reduced its stake, including a £400m 
share sale this year.
"It is an interesting, difficult business, but that is part of what keeps me intellectually engaged," Franke said, clearly 
with an eye to continue making a mark on a business that he has helped evolve over his decades as an investor 
and turnround specialist. Philip Georgiadis

The German low-cost carrier Eurowings continues to invest in the Swedish market and will set up a new base at 
Stockholm Arlanda Airport for the summer 2022 season. The carrier, owned by Lufthansa, will expand its range of 
destinations and improve access from Stockholm, adding twenty new direct routes in Europe.
Eurowings will be the third airline to set up a base at Arlanda in a short period of time. In May, the Irish-based low-
cost carrier Ryanair announced its plans to open a base initially with two aircraft and some 20 European routes as 
well as domestic service to Gothenburg and Malmö. In July, One World Alliance member Finnair announced that it 
is placing three aircraft at Arlanda, making a major investment in Sweden with intercontinental service from Arlanda 
and enhancing access to Asia and the US.
"Eurowings' continued expansion in Sweden entails a major increase in capacity and is a complement to our 
airports' existing range of flights on offer. The fact that Eurowings has now chosen to set up a base at Arlanda is 
clear evidence of the airline's strong faith in development opportunities in the largest market in Scandinavia and in 
the attractiveness of the Stockholm region. This improved access is important to the tourism industry across 
Sweden. The expansion also suggests further growth can be expected in the low-cost segment of the Swedish 
market going forward. We have a good collaboration with Eurowings, which we happily look forward to developing 
in the future," says Elizabeth Axtelius, Director Aviation Business at Swedavia.
Eurowings intends to expand its summer 2022 programme in conjunction with the opening of the new base at 
Stockholm Arlanda in late March. With its set-up of operations, the German low-cost carrier will initially place 5 
aircraft at Arlanda and launch twenty new European destinations, of which a couple will be new for the airport and 
complement Arlanda's other destinations.
"Sweden is a market that fits perfectly with our goal to be the number one European value carrier. Since the 
pandemic, many travelers are no longer looking first for the cheapest ticket, but for an airline they can 
unconditionally trust in terms of safety, reliability, and social responsibility. With our Lufthansa DNA - for example an 
attractive network of low-cost direct flights and an unmatched customer service - we can offer just that," says Jens 
Bischof, CEO at Eurowings.
Further low-cost expansion at Stockholm Arlanda - Eurowings to make major investment, set up new base and 
add twenty new European routes
Eurowings has provided service at Stockholm Arlanda for a number of years, and the new base will be its fourth 
one outside the German-speaking region. The airline sees opportunities and has recently developed its range of 
destinations in other parts of Sweden as well. Eurowings currently offers direct service from Arlanda to Hamburg 
and Düsseldorf. Before the pandemic, it also served Cologne and likewise flew from Göteborg Landvetter to 
Düsseldorf. Earlier this year, it launched direct service from Malmö to the capital of Kosovo, Pristina. The airline is 
also introducing international service to Stuttgart from both Kiruna and Luleå in December.
Planned routes for the S22 season from Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN). Additional routes to be announced:
ARN - BCN
ARN - FCO
ARN - PMI
ARN - NCE
ARN - CPH
ARN - AGP
ARN - BHX
ARN - GDN
ARN - ALC
ARN - PRN
ARN - FAO
ARN - BER
Eurowings offers a transfer product, which means passengers can book connecting flights from other airports it 
serves and take their baggage along with them on the entire journey. Eurowings is the Lufthansa Group's low-cost 
carrier and part of the world's largest airline group. It works continuously to improve and protect the climate and 
environment and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Swedavia has carried out ambitious sustainability work for many years. All ten of its airports achieved the goal of 
zero fossil carbon dioxide emissions from their own operations by year-end 2020. Swedavia also works actively to 
promote the switch to biofuel and has the goal that five per cent of all fuel used for refuelling at Swedish airports 
shall be fossil-free by 2025.
Swedavia complies with the authorities' advice and recommendations on Covid-19. In addition, we comply with 
international aviation industry regulations. For information about the measures Swedavia has introduced for safe 
travel, see for example: swedavia.com/arlanda/before-your-journey.

? Wall Street stocks and Treasuries dip after strong retail sales data ? European stocks climb, propelled by travel 
and leisure shares ? Hong Kong's Hang Seng heading for worst week since height of pandemic US stocks and 
government bonds slipped yesterday after stronger than expected data on retail sales raised expectations that the 
Federal Reserve would soon begin reining in its stimulus efforts.
Wall Street's blue-chip S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite indices were both down 0.6 per cent at 
lunchtime in New York. US Treasury prices were also under pressure, pushing the yield on the 10-year note up 3 
basis points to 1.33 per cent.
The soft session came after a report from the commerce department showed US retail sales climbed 0.7 per cent in 
August compared with July, widely topping economists' expectations for a 0.8 per cent decline.
Consumption accounts for about 70 per cent of US economic output, so retail sales data are scrutinised by many 
Wall Street traders.
"The health of the US consumer is really one of the most important anchors of sustained economic recovery," said 
Madison Faller, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.
"We're really expecting more strong demand out of the consumption part of the economy," she added, "particularly 
given the fact that consumers have really healthy balance sheets."
The positive data come after Jay Powell, the Fed chair, in August strongly signalled that the most influential central 
bank could begin slowing its $120bn per month asset purchase programme this year.
The day in the markets What you need to know
The central bank meets next week, when traders will be watching closely for any update on plans to "taper" its 
bondbuying programme.
Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, said that while one-time factors could have affected the August retail 
sales data, "in the 'will they or won't they' debate about a Fed taper announcement next Wednesday, this report 
certainly supports the pro-taper side".
Stocks in Europe fared better than Wall Street's, with the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closing up 0.4 per cent, 
buoyed by the continent's travel and leisure sector that rose 3.4 per cent after Ryanair raised its traffic growth 
outlook.
In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.5 per cent after Beijing's intensifying focus on sectors spanning 
gambling to education knocked investor sentiment.
The gauge has shed almost 6 per cent this week, leaving it on track for its worst run since the market tumult in 
March last year. Harriet Clarfelt

? Wall Street stocks and Treasuries dip after strong retail sales data ? European stocks climb, propelled by travel 
and leisure shares ? Hong Kong's Hang Seng heading for worst week since height of pandemic US stocks and 
government bonds slipped yesterday after stronger than expected data on retail sales raised expectations that the 
Federal Reserve would soon begin reining in its stimulus efforts.
Wall Street's blue-chip S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite indices were both down 0.6 per cent at 
lunchtime in New York. US Treasury prices were also under pressure, pushing the yield on the 10-year note up 3 
basis points to 1.33 per cent.
The soft session came after a report from the commerce department showed US retail sales climbed 0.7 per cent in 
August compared with July, widely topping economists' expectations for a 0.8 per cent decline.
Consumption accounts for about 70 per cent of US economic output, so retail sales data are scrutinised by many 
Wall Street traders.
"The health of the US consumer is really one of the most important anchors of sustained economic recovery," said 
Madison Faller, global market strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.
"We're really expecting more strong demand out of the consumption part of the economy," she added, "particularly 
given the fact that consumers have really healthy balance sheets."
The positive data come after Jay Powell, the Fed chair, in August strongly signalled that the most influential central 
bank could begin slowing its $120bn per month asset purchase programme this year.
The day in the markets What you need to know
The central bank meets next week, when traders will be watching closely for any update on plans to "taper" its 
bondbuying programme.
Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, said that while one-time factors could have affected the August retail 
sales data, "in the 'will they or won't they' debate about a Fed taper announcement next Wednesday, this report 
certainly supports the pro-taper side".
Stocks in Europe fared better than Wall Street's, with the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closing up 0.4 per cent, 
buoyed by the continent's travel and leisure sector that rose 3.4 per cent after Ryanair raised its traffic growth 
outlook.
In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.5 per cent after Beijing's intensifying focus on sectors spanning 
gambling to education knocked investor sentiment.
The gauge has shed almost 6 per cent this week, leaving it on track for its worst run since the market tumult in 
March last year. Harriet Clarfelt

Highlight: Latvia's Riga International Airport (RIX) has reported passenger volume of over 390,000 in the month of 
August, which is nearly half of the August 2019 figures.
Body
According to airport performance data, passenger numbers in August 2021 were 92,000 more than the previous 
month. In a statement, RIX said: "The majority or 60% of passengers in August were carried by the national airline 
airBaltic, 18% by the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and 7% by Wizz Air. 
"Of the 87 destinations offered by Riga Airport in August, London, Tallinn and Kiev were the most popular travel 
destinations." However, compared to August last year, passenger volume at the airport decreased by 53%. In the 
first eight months of this year, passenger numbers at the airport declined by 79% compared to 2019 and by 36% 
when compared to last year. In August 2021, RIX serviced 42% fewer flights than in August 2019. Last month, the 
airport handled a total of 4,878 flights, of which 3,772 were run by scheduled passenger carriers. The cargo 
segment at the airport witnessed growth. RIX handled 39% more cargo flights in August 2021 versus August 2019 
while the number of cargo flights serviced in the first eight months of this year nearly doubled compared to the 
same period of 2019. The volume of cargo carried on cargo flights at the airport surged 52%, compared to the first 
eight months of 2019. In July, RIX entered the Airport Council International (ACI) Europe initiative Net Zero 2050 to 
attain a 100% reduction of carbon emissions under the airport's direct control by 2050. The airport has pledged to 
not produce CO2 emissions in its basic operations or emissions that cannot be avoided or indemnified with suitable 
storage of equivalent amounts of greenhouse emission gases until 2050.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) is still in talks with Boeing (BOE.L, BOEI.BR) to order more aircraft, Chief Executive Michael

until the plane manufacturer lowered its prices before ordering more 737 MAX 10 aircraft.

to carry 225 million passengers annually by March 2026.

Construction company Galliford Try rallied after announcing a return to profitability for the 12 months ending June 
30.
Coming off the back of a 3.2 per cent rise in revenue to £1.13bn, pre-tax profit hit £11.4m against a loss of £59.7m 
in 2020.
A full-year dividend was also reinstated, totalling 4.7 pence per share.
Broker Liberum raised the Uxbridge group's target price on expectations of "a strong pipeline of activity in the public 
and private sector".
An upbeat trading update lifted Wickes Group, the DIY retailer.
For the full year, it forecast adjusted pre-tax profit towards the upper end of market expectations, which range from 
£67m to £75m.

LONDON (AP) — Irish airline Ryanair said Thursday that it's planning to create 5,000 jobs over the next five years 
as part of its recovery from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic.
The additional pilots, cabin crew and engineers will mean that the company will have more than recouped the 3,000 
jobs it got rid of at the start of the pandemic last year.
CEO Michael O’Leary said the carrier has been snapping up slots that have been vacated by airlines that have 
either collapsed or retrenched over the past 18 months or so.
“Ryanair will open 10 new bases across Europe this year as we work with airport partners to help them recover 
traffic and jobs post-COVID, and take up slot opportunities that are being vacated by competitor airlines who have 
collapsed or significantly reduced their fleet sizes," he said before the company’s annual shareholder meeting in 
Dublin.
Ryanair also upgraded forecasts for growth over the next five years, with projections that passenger numbers will 
grow by 50%, compared with 33% predicted previously. That equates to 226 million passengers by March 2026, 25 
million more than previous targets.
“We can recover strongly from the COVID pandemic and deliver higher-than-expected growth in both traffic and 
jobs over the next five years,” O'Leary said.

3.50pm: UK blue chips come off their best levels
Leading shares have lost some of their gains as Wall Street heads south after a mixed start.
With conflicting US economic signals - better than expected retail sales and Philadelphia manufacturing survey but 
slightly higher than expected jobless claims - investors have been struggling to weigh up the impact.
Concerns over a slowdown in China and uncertainty over the fate of its struggling property developer Evergrande 
have helped dampen sentiment.
Rising energy prices are also a worry, given they will mean increased costs for businesses.
Heading towards the close the FTSE 100 is up 21.32 points or 0.30% at 7037.81 after earlier climbing as high as 
7058.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average meanwhile is down 178.04 points or 0.51%. The S&P 500 has lost 0.62% and 
the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 0.55%.
Another bit of fallout from China was a drop in metal prices after news it planned to release some of its reserves to 
boost supply.
FTSE 100 off best level but still ahead as Rolls-Royce boosted by Aukus deal, but mining shares slide
So miners are dominating the fallers in the UK blue chip index. Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) is down 4.52%, 
precious metals group Fresnillo PLC (LSE:FRES) has fallen 3.26%, Rio Tinto PLC (LSE:RIO) is down 2.76%, BHP 
PLC has lost 2.68% and Antofagasta PLC (LSE:ANTO) is off 2.25%.
Still heading higher though is plant hire group Ashtead PLC, up 5.23% after well received results.
Rolls-Royce has risen 3.79% after it was mentioned in the agreement forming a trilateral security partnership 
between the US, UK and Australia called Aukus which will in part build new nuclear powered submarines.
3.02pm: Ryanair update lifts airline shares
A positive update from Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has given a lift to the whole airline sector, which has been 
under cosh again in recent days on worries about the prospects for international travel.
Ryanair said it planned to fly an extra 25mln passengers by 2026 - up from its previous target of 200mln - as the 
industry tries to rebound from the pandemic.
UBS analysts said: "The company now plans to increase passengers by 50% from March 2020 levels of 149mln 
passenger (to 225mn) by March 2026.
"Previous guidance was around 200mln passengers and we currently forecast 203mln passengers.
"Should the profitability per passenger be maintained then we expect upward pressure to forecasts. Indeed a c11% 
upgrade to passenger numbers versus our passenger forecasts for 2026 at similar levels of profitability would all 
else being equal also increase our net income from around (EURO)2.3bn to around (EURO)2.5bn. There is the 
potential for improved profitability per passenger given the gearing."
The news has pushed Ryanair's shares up 7.55% to (EURO)16.52, while British Airways owner International 
Consolidated Airlines PLC has climbed by 3.27% and EasyJet PLC has improved by 6.36%. Wizz Air Holdings 
(AIM:WIZZ) PLC has also benefited, adding 4.62%.
2.47pm: US markets uncertain after latest data
Wall Street has made a mixed start to trading, as investors pored over the latest set of economic data.
The better than expected retail sales and Philadelphia manufacturing survey has helped push the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average 52.2 points or 0.15% higher to 34,866.59.
But the more broadly based S&P 500 is down 0.12% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is 0.36% lower.
Back in the UK, the FTSE 100 remains in positive territory, up 36.63 points or 0.51% at 7050.57.
2.25pm: Philly Fed manufacturing survey jumps sharply
As well as the retail sales and jobless claims, the latest manufacturing survey from the Philadephia Federal 
Reserve came in much stronger than expected.
The index jumped from 19.4 to 30.7, much better than the forecast dip to 18.8.
Investors now have to weigh up what this all for the Federal Reserve and whether or not it will start to taper its 
support for the economy.
Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA said: "Today's data from the US has done little to clear things up, 
with both retail sales and the Philly Fed manufacturing index smashing expectations while jobless claims popped a 
little but only just exceeded forecasts. Retail sales have been volatile for a number of months but an August 
increase of 0.7% was the reverse of the decline that was expected.
FTSE 100 off best level but still ahead as Rolls-Royce boosted by Aukus deal, but mining shares slide
"Philly Fed has been trending lower since March and that trend was expected to continue but a surprise jump may 
be cause for optimism. While new orders and employment indicators softened, firms remain optimistic about the 
next 6 months as current general activity and shipments saw large increases."
1.41pm: Stronger than expected US retail sales
US retail sales have come in stronger than expected in August.
They rose by 0.7% compared with expectations of a 0.7% fall. However the July figure was revised from a 1.1% fall 
to a 1.8% decline.
Sales at clothing stores were up 38.8% while gasoline sales rose 35.7%. But there was another sharp drop in car 
sales.

September 16, 2021
Elsewhere weekly jobless claims were higher than forecast.
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefit last week was 332,000, compared to expectations of a 
figure of 323,000
The previous week's figure was revised up by 2,000 to 312,000.
 August US retail sales and September initial jobless claims very resilient to the Delta wave. Lower Consumer 
Confidence looks like an outlier here. - Mikolaj Raczynski (@MikRaczynski) September 16, 2021
After the data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now expected to show a miniscule 0.01% fall at the open, with 
the S&P 500 down 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite a fall of 0.27%.
Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is up 27.87 points or 0.4% at 7044.36.
12.08pm: Investors await US retail sales and jobless claims
Worries about a Chinese slowdown and the fate of the country's struggling property group Evergrande are likely to 
weigh on Wall Street when trading begins.
US markets ended the Wednesday session higher, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to edge 23 
points or 0.1% lower at the open. The S&P 500 is forecast to show a 0.14% decline and the Nasdaq Composite is 
indicated 0.21% lower.
The day's economic news includes retail sales, which have been fairly volatile recently. 
Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: "While the summer months have seen holiday and theme parks reopen, 
we've also seen the prices of almost everything soar, including used cars, and air fares, while cases of the Delta 
variant have impacted consumer confidence with sharp drops across the board in August.
"This is particularly disappointing for an economy that relies so much on consumer spending, and which has seen 
retail sales stall over the last three months. A decline of -1.7% in May, a rise of 0.7% in June and a -1.1% decline in 
July looks set to be followed by another decline in numbers that are due to be released later today."
Analysts are forecasting a drop of 0.7% for August.
Meanwhile the weekly jobless claims are expected to edge up from 310,000 to 323,000.
Back in the UK, the FTSE 100 remains steady, up 32.2 points or 0.46% at 7048.69.

11.38am: Labour shortages show no sign of improving
More evidence of staff shortages, especially in the hospitality industry, from the latest data from the Office for 
National Statistics.
According to the report, 13% of all business said it was harder to fill vacancies than usual, up from 9% in early 
August. For the hospitality industry that figure was 30%.
 With UK job vacancies at a record high, some industries are reporting difficulties in recruiting staff ???? Hospitality 
businesses are twice as likely as other industries to be experiencing challenges in filling vacancies (30% compared 
with 13%) https://t.co/XExKFmm39f pic.twitter.com/K7NL7yhZjI - Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) 
September 16, 2021
Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said: "The labour shortage has been tough for businesses trying to 
capitalise on post lockdown trade and it doesn't show any sign of getting better in a hurry, in fact the situation only 
seems be getting more acute.
"It's no surprise to see hospitality topping the list of those struggling to recruit. Restrictions meant they were late to 
the party and many people who used to work in bars and restaurants found other jobs to pay the bills, jobs that 
often have more sociable hours. There's also a niggling uncertainty amongst the public that we've really seen an 
end to restrictions and most people believe that any spike in COVID cases would result in hospitality being forced to 
close once again.
"Anyone who has shopped for groceries recently will have experienced a nasty moment at the till when they've 
realised how much more expensive food is becoming and the HGV driver shortage has been a key factor in those 
price rises. Almost half of businesses in the transport and storage sector said that a lack of EU workers was to 
blame for the shortages and across the board one in four businesses said a fall in the number of EU applicants was 
an issue.
"It's hard to know how big a part Brexit has played because the waters have been well and truly muddied by the 
pandemic. It's also impossible to guess how the end of the furlough scheme will change the picture. Some jobs will 
be lost, and some workers will be brought back into the labour market where they will be received with open arms 
ifthe latest recruitment drive by John Lewis is anything to go by."
The survey showed that businesses across all industries said that a lack of suitable applicants was the main reason 
for being unable to fill vacancies in late August 2021, with transport and storage firms the most likely to cite a lack of 
EU applicants specifically.
11.25am: Marks and Spencer confirms closure of 11 French stores
Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LSE:MKS) shares have fallen 1.63% as the retailer confirmed reports it plans to 
close 11 of its French stores because of supply problems since Brexit.
The stores, run with partner SFH, will close by the end of the year, with nine sites at travel hubs remaining.
Paul Friston, M&S managing director of international, told the BBC: "M&S has a long history of serving customers in 
France and this is not a decision we or our partner SFH have taken lightly.
"However, as things stand today, the supply chain complexities in place following the UK's exit from the European 
Union now make it near impossible for us to serve fresh and chilled products to customers to the high standards 
they expect, resulting in an ongoing impact to the performance of our business.
"With no workable alternative for the High Street stores, we have agreed with SFH to close all 11 franchised 
stores."
10.26am: Power companies in demand
FTSE 100 off best level but still ahead as Rolls-Royce boosted by Aukus deal, but mining shares slide
Rising energy prices as we start heading into winter may be bad news for consumers and industry (the surge in the 
cost of gas has already caused fertiliser producer CF Industries to halt operations at two UK sites and steel 
producers have made similar moves).
But it's an ill wind etc.
Energy companies themselves have seen their share prices boosted by the recent record run in power prices.
Power station operator Drax PLC has risen 7.21% - helped by a positive note from Barclays - while SSE PLC 
(LSE:SSE) is up 0.85% and National Grid (LSE:NG.) PLC is 0.6% better.
Overall the FTSE 100 is holding on to its gains, up 36.26 points or 0.52% at 7052.75.
Meanwhile the FTSE 250 - where Drax is the leading riser - is up 0.56% at 23,565.09.
9.38am: Evergrande saga adds to China concerns while mining shares drop
Speaking of China, the recent economic data including retail sales suggests a slowdown in the world's second 
biggest economy which is causing some worry for investors.
But there are also concerns about a potential collapse of the country's second largest property developer, 
Evergrande, which is facing a liquidity crisis.
It has total liabilities of US$300bn and is trying to raise funding to stave off a crisis.
The latest development saw its onshore unit halt trading in all bonds after agencies cut their ratings on its paper.
China is also having an impact on the commodities market, with metal prices falling after the country said it would 
release more of its reserves to tackle supply shortages.
So mining companies are dominating the FTSE 100 fallers.
Rio Tinto PLC (LSE:RIO) is down 2.17%, Anglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) is off 1.59%, Antofagasta PLC 
(LSE:ANTO) has fallen 1.09% and BHP PLC has lost 0.93%.
But the biggest faller is Burberry PLC, which has been weak for days on the potential slowdown in Asia, one of its 
key markets.
Its is now another 2.42% lower.
The FTSE 100 however remains positive, up 32.99 points or 0.47% at 7049.48.
9.23am: Defence companies in the spotlight
Confrontation with China is clearly seen by the market as a good thing for the UK defence industry.
So it is with the announcement that the US, UK and Australian governments are setting up a trilateral security 
partnership called Aukus which will in part build new nuclear powered submarines.
The UK statement on the deal included the following: "The UK has built and operated world-class nuclear-powered 
submarines for over 60 years. We will therefore bring deep expertise and experience to the project through, for 
example, the work carried out by Rolls Royce near Derby and BAE Systems in Barrow."
As a result, Rolls-Royce PLC shares are leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 3.51% or 3.7p to 109.2p.
BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.) is 1.02% better at 554.6p.
Overall the FTSE 100 is holding on to its gains, up 34.22 points or 0.49% at 7050.71.
FTSE 100 off best level but still ahead as Rolls-Royce boosted by Aukus deal, but mining shares slide
8.29am: Markets open in the green
Investors in the UK decided to take succour from recent US manufacturing and inflation data that were more benign 
than expected rather than the unfolding slowdown being experienced in China, the world's economic growth engine.
As a result, the FTSE 100 opened 31 points to the good at 7,047.46.
"The generally positive opening was led by some strength within cyclical shares, although the moves were 
unconvincing," said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.
"The indices nonetheless remain ahead in the year to date, with the FTSE100 having added 9% and the FTSE250 
14.8%.
"Even so, with the known issues now on the table and potentially priced in, the next catalysts could either come 
from renewed signs of a global economic bounce back, or the third-quarter reporting season providing positive 
shocks in the first weeks of October."
The mining stocks were on offer following the latest lacklustre Chinese data with Anglo American, off 1.5%, leading 
the early fallers. Burberry, which also has big exposure to the country, was an early casualty too.
On the flipside, traders reacted positively to first-quarter results from the US-focused plant hire group Ashtead, 
whose shares opened 2.5% higher.
6.50 am: FTSE 100 seen a sliver higher 
The FTSE 100 is set to start Thursday a sliver higher after US stock indices moved higher, and, this morning Asian 
markets turned lower.
CFD firm IG Markets sees the FTSE 100 around 2 points higher, making the price 7,030 to 7,033 with just over an 
hour to go until the open.
US markets were boosted on Wednesday as key regional manufacturing statistics significantly beat expectations, 
raising sentiments ahead of the American economy's big-ticket economic release of the week - monthly retail sales 
data due later today.
"Overall, the week is going to plan thus far. As expected, markets, particularly in the US, are cherry-picking news 
headlines and tier-2 data to fit the narrative of flip-flopping daily sentiment," OANDA market analyst Jeffrey Halley 
said in a note.
"Hopefully, next week's cast of thousands line-up of central bank policy decisions, staring the Federal Reserve, 
delivers more thematic clarity. In the meantime, I shall leave my earplugs in to drown the noise and continue to 
believe in the gospel of buying-the-dip in a central bank-primed, unlimited money at zero per cent world."
The Dow Jones rose by 236 points, 0.68%, to finish Wednesday at 34,814 whilst the S&P 500 gained more, rising 
0.85% to 4,480.
The Nasdaq similarly added 0.8% as it climbed 123 points to a close of 15,161.
Elsewhere the small-cap centric Russell 2,000 index was strongest, stepping up 1.1% to 2,234.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.66% by the last hour of trading, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics

strengthening of labour market conditions.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) increased its growth forecast for the next five years to 50% from 33% previously, 
on the back of opportunities created by the new Gamechanger aircraft.
The Irish airline said in its AGM statement that it now expects passenger numbers to grow to over 225mln by March 
2026, well above the previous target of 200mln.
Ryanair is taking delivery of 210 B737 Gamechanger aircraft over the next five years, which is expected to lower 
costs and reduce emissions.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "The performance of the B737 Gamechanger aircraft this summer 
has exceeded our expectations. Operational reliability, fuel consumption, and lower CO2 emissions have so far 
exceeded guidelines with very positive passenger and crew feedback to these new, more fuel efficient, quieter 
aircraft."
He said Ryanair will open 10 new bases across Europe this year and take up slot opportunities that are being 
vacated by competitor airlines who have collapsed or reduced their fleet sizes.
The airline expects to create over 5,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers over the next five years, he 
added.
"The Covid-19 pandemic has delivered an unprecedented blow to Europe's aviation and tourism industries. Only 
Ryanair has used this crisis to place significantly increased aircraft orders, to expand our airport partnerships, and 
to secure lower operating costs so that we can pass on even lower fares to our guests, so that together with our 
Ryanair raises five-year growth forecast, shares climb
airport partners, we can recover strongly from the Covid pandemic and deliver higher than expected growth in both 
traffic and jobs over the next 5 years," O'Leary said.
UBS added that If profitability per passenger is maintained it expects upward pressure to forecasts.
"Indeed a c11% upgrade to passenger numbers vs our passenger forecasts for 2026 at similar levels of profitability 
would all else being equal also increase our net income from c(EURO)2.3bn to c(EURO)2.5bn.
"There is the potential for improved profitability per passenger given the gearing."
Ryanair shares were up 7.68% at (EURO)16.54 in early afternoon trade.

Sep 16, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 In June of this year, after the Lukashenko government's forced grounding of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, the EU 
announced[1] that 78 persons and seven entities would be added to their sanctions against Belarus. Following suit 
this Monday (13 September), the UK government imposed[2] a raft of trade, financial, and aviation restrictions in 
response to the abuses of the Lukashenko regime. One controversial inclusion in both rounds of sanctions was 
Mikhail Gutseriev, the Russian entrepreneur and philanthropist, who has business interests in the Belarusian 
energy and hospitality sectors. Many have been puzzled as to why Gutseriev, as a businessman with investments 
all over the world, has been targeted in connection to his relatively limited involvement in Belarus. His case has also 
raised broader questions and initiated a debate about the efficacy of sanctions which confer guilt by association, 
rather than punish known lawbreakers, writes Colin Stevens. 
The EU's 'restrictive measures' 
Starting with the EU's approach, the block has a well-established process for executing 'restrictive measures', the 
primary tool of its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). European sanctions have four key objectives[3]: 
safeguarding the EU's interests and security, preserving the peace, supporting democracy and human rights, and 
strengthening international security. If sanctions are imposed, they can fall on governments, companies, groups or 
organisations, and individuals. In terms of ratification[4], the EU's Foreign Affairs and Security representative, and 
the European Commission, make a joint sanction proposal, which is then voted on by the European Council. If the 
vote is passed, the EU's court will then decide if the measure protects 'human rights and fundamental freedoms, in 
particular due process and the right to an effective remedy'. Note that the European Parliament, the EU's 
democratically elected chamber, is kept informed of the proceedings but can neither reject nor ratify the sanctions. 
The difficulty of application 
When adding an individual or entity to their sanctions list, the EU sets out why they deem the measure to be 
appropriate. Returning to the controversial case of Mikhail Gutseriev, the block has accused[5] Gutseriev of 
'benefitting from and supporting the Lukashenko regime'. They describe him as a 'long-time friend' of the President, 
International sanctions: Easy to misapply and hard to reverse
the supposed smoking gun being two times when both men were confirmed to be in the same vicinity. The first was 
at the opening of a new Orthodox church, which Gutseriev had sponsored, and the second was at Lukashenko's 
swearing-in as President, what the EU describes as a 'secret' event, despite it being broadcast on TV and being 
open to the public. The EU also reports[6] that Lukashenko once thanked Gutseriev for the money he had given to 
Belarusian charities and the billions of dollars he had invested in the country. 
Taking a step back, it's clear that the EU is working on the basis of guilt by association - Gutseriev has been in 
Lukashenko's orbit, ergo he is a supporter of his regime. However, the problem with the EU's approach is that there 
is little hard evidence of a genuine closeness between the two men. What is there to say that Gutseriev did not 
simply maintain a working relationship with the President so that he could continue to invest and run his businesses 
in Belarus? In a communication explaining its internal process, the European Commission states[7] that restrictive 
measures are imposed 'to bring about a change in policy activityby entities or individuals'. To change a harmful 
policy is of course desirable, but the EU must be careful not to disincentivise the small group of investors who take 
the risk of operating in, and making charitable donations to, low-income countries with unstable leaderships. 
The UK's position 
Considering this potential drawback in their approach, the EU will undoubtedly have been pleased that the British 
government has likewise targeted Lukashenko and those deemed to be close to him. Dominic Raab, the Foreign 
Secretary, accused[8] the Belarusian President of crushing democracy and outlined that action would be taken 
against the country's state-owned industries and aerospace companies. In general, the UK's sanctioning process 
has similar objectives to the EU's, and both favour trade and financial measures, such as arms embargoes and 
asset freezes. Like their partners in Europe, the British government will be hoping that they can change 
Lukashenko's policies and approach, without inflicting unnecessary economic harm on ordinary Belarussians. Yet 
history shows that finding this balance is far from easy. Going back to the early 2000s, the British government and 
the EU imposed[9] sanctions on Belarus and Zimbabwe, and on their wealthy elites. Judging by the positions of 
both countries now, with Belarus under Lukashenko, and Zimbabwe still beset by economic woes and internal 
conflict, one would be hard pressed to say that such an approach had been a success. 
Getting things right 
In fairness to the EU and the UK, they have clarified that they want to avoid adverse consequences for those not 
responsible for the policies and actions in question. However, by ascribing sanctions on the basis of guilt by 
association, both parties run the risk of doing exactly that. Hassan Blasim, the celebrated Kurdish film director who 
fled Saddam Hussein's regime, said that the West's economic sanctions meant that 'life was almost dead' in Iraq in 
the 1990s. What's more, it was a hugely controversial invasion, not the regime of sanctions, which eventually led to 
Hussein's downfall. Western diplomats may be trying their best to avoid doing similar damage today, but they 
should be careful not to undermine the investment and enterprise, the lifeblood of any economy, that Belarus will 
need to rebuild in the future.

 Despite fears around the future of aviation and international travel Ryaniar announces big plans and investments 
over the next five years. 
 Subject to no adverse Covid developments, and vaccinations remaining at above 90 per cent across Europe, 
Ryanair will take delivery of 210 B737 Gamechanger aircraft over the next five years. 
 According to Ryanair, these new planes deliver industry lowest costs, reduced emissions, and will enable Ryanair 
accelerate its post-Covid growth, as opportunities open up at primary and secondary airports all over Europe, 
particularly where legacy carriers have failed or reduced fleet sizes as a result of Covid and State Aid. 
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'With these new deliveries, Ryanair will open 10 new bases across Europe this 
year as we work with airport partners to help them recover traffic &#38; jobs post Covid, and take up slot 
opportunities that are being vacated by competitor airlines who have collapsed or significantly reduced their fleet 
sizes. 
 On jobs, Mr O'Leary added: 'Ryanair expects to create over 5,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers 
over the next 5 years, and the Group is excited to have, earlier this week, opened a €50m Aviation Training Centre 
in Dublin, with 2 further high quality training centres planned for Spain and Poland over the next 5 years.' 
 In addition, Ryanair's pre-Covid traffic of 149m is expected to grow to over 225m guests by March 2026, which is 
25m passengers p.a. higher than the previous target of 200m.

2021.(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) 
LONDON (AP) — Irish airline Ryanair said Thursday that it's planning to create 5,000 jobs over the next five years 
as part of its recovery from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic. 
 The additional pilots, cabin crew and engineers will mean that the company will have more than recouped the 
3,000 jobs it got rid of at the start of the pandemic last year. 
 CEO Michael O'Leary said the carrier has been snapping up slots that have been vacated by airlines that have 
either collapsed or retrenched over the past 18 months or so. 
 'Ryanair will open 10 new bases across Europe this year as we work with airport partners to help them recover 
traffic and jobs post-COVID, and take up slot opportunities that are being vacated by competitor airlines who have 
collapsed or significantly reduced their fleet sizes," he said before the company's annual shareholder meeting in 
Dublin. 
 Ryanair also upgraded forecasts for growth over the next five years, with projections that passenger numbers will 
grow by 50%, compared with 33% predicted previously. That equates to 226 million passengers by March 2026, 25 
million more than previous targets. 
 'We can recover strongly from the COVID pandemic and deliver higher-than-expected growth in both traffic and 
jobs over the next five years,' O'Leary said. Should you invest $1,000 in Ryanair right now?[1] Before you consider

Ryanair Holdings has initiated a forced sale of shares that have been acquired by or on behalf of United Kingdom 
nationals since January 1, 2021, the company has outlined in a stock exchange disclosure.
As a result of Brexit, UK citizens have been barred from buying stock in the Irish low-cost airline since the UK-EU 
split took effect at the start of this year.
If such purchases have been made by or on behalf of UK nationals, Ryanair Holdings - parent of Ryanair, Malta Air, 
Buzz, and Lauda Europe - has treated them as "restricted shares" and told the owners to dispose of them to EU 
nationals, it explained in the September 8 filing.
This has been necessary to ensure the company's continued compliance with EU airline ownership and control 
requirements, it said. Some investors have not complied, however, and as a result Ryanair "has initiated the forced 
sale of approximately 1 million ordinary shares in accordance with its Articles of Association."
Ryanair Holdings has appointed a broker to conduct the sale independently of, and uninfluenced by, the company 
over the coming weeks, it added, and "the net proceeds will be transmitted to the relevant investors in due course." 
The company currently has around 222 million shares outstanding according to company data.
Britons who already owned shares in the company - which is traded in Dublin, London, and New York - have been 
allowed to keep holdings that were acquired before January 1.
"It is expected that the company may initiate further forced sales of restricted shares from time to time," Ryanair 
warned, and it "may elect to do so without any further announcement."
The prohibition on non-EU nationals acquiring ordinary shares in Ryanair Holdings, as announced in February 
2002, continues to apply. But non-EU nationals including UK citizens can continue to invest in it via its American 
Depositary Receipt scheme on the NASDAQ in the United States.

Ryanair, has announced a new agreement with Airline Flight Academy (AFA) at the opening of a brand new 
(EURO)50m Aviation Training Centre in Santry, close to Dublin Airport. This new Training and Simulator Centre 
contains three full-motion simulators, one 737 MAX and two Airbus A320, together with two fixed-base simulators 
(one Boeing 737 and one Airbus A320). Additionally, this new AFA Centre contains a state of the art cabin crew 
training and emergency evacuation device, as well as a specialist cabin fire training centre. The AFA Centre 
contains over 15 large classroom training centres and 5 individual pilot briefing/debriefing rooms. Access to these 
new facilities will enable Ryanair to recruit and train over 5,000 new pilots, cabin crew, engineers and ground 
operations professionals over the next five years - jobs that will be necessary for the crew to operate Ryanair's 210 
new Boeing 737 Gamechanger aircraft, which will enable Ryanair to grow annual traffic to 200m p.a. by 2025.
Ryanair has chosen Airline Flight Academy to be its exclusive cadet training partner. Under this agreement, Airline 
Flight Academy will operate and run this new (EURO)50m Training Centre and will play a central role in recruiting 
the next generation of aviation professionals, including pilots, cabin crew, engineers and ground operations 
professionals for Ryanair's next phase of post-Covid growth and expansion.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: "After what has been an incredibly difficult 18months, today's announcement is a real 
vote of confidence in the airline industry as it rebuilds after the pandemic. This (EURO)50m investment in a new 
training centre and the creation of 5,000 jobs across Europe, will mean fantastic opportunities for pilots, cabin crew, 
engineers and ground ops professionals over the next 5 years. It's incredible growth and makes me really optimistic 
for the future. Congratulations to the team involved."
Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said: "We are honoured to welcome Tánaiste Leo Varadkar to the opening of the 
Airline Flight Academy Training Centre here in Santry. We have invested over (EURO)50m in this state-of-the-art 
Training Centre, and our agreement with AFA will deliver over 5,000 highly trained pilots, cabin crew, engineers and 
ground operations professionals over the next five years. Ryanair will create over 5,000 new jobs thanks to the 
expansion of our Boeing 737 fleet, with 210 MAX Gamechangers to be delivered over the next five years which will 
enable Ryanair to grow to carry 200m passengers p.a. by 2025.
The AFA team have been a recruitment and training partner of Ryanair for many years, and we look forward to 
continuing to invest in this agreement, which has to date, enabled Ryanair to recruit and train over 18,000 highly 
qualified aviation professionals."
Ryanair invests (EURO)50m in a new Dublin training and simulator centre
IAA Aviation Regulator / CEO Designate, Diarmuid Ó Conghaile said: "We welcome the expansion of Ryanair's 
training operations. It is another positive sign for the future of aviation in Ireland and the support services required. 
The investment in a training and simulation centre will create jobs for highly skilled workers, which will benefit the 
broader Irish aviation sector as it re-bounds from the crisis of the past 18 months."
Director AFA, Francis Farrell said: "Airline Flight Academy is honoured to have been selected as Ryanair's 
exclusive cadet training partner here in Ireland. We are excited to be chosen to operate and run this new 
(EURO)50m Aviation Training Centre in Santry and have committed to delivering Ryanair over 5,000 highly trained 
pilots, cabin crew, engineers, and ground ops professionals using these state of art facilities in Santry. Ireland has 
always been a centre for high-quality aviation professionals and AFA's agreement with Ryanair will create 5,000 
new jobs, both here in Ireland and across Europe, as Ryanair continues to recover and grow post-Covid."

EasyJet 's £1.2bn rights issue puts strategy in doubt
EasyJet's £1.2bn rights issue puts strategy in doubt

Every seasoned traveller knows to avoid the middle seat. And easyJet isn't doing a good job of making it look 
comfortable.
The airline, which occupies the space between aggressive low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and the legacy flag 
carriers, last week launched a surprise £1.2bn rights issue. The cash call was overshadowed by the news that 
easyJet had rejected a takeover approach from one fierce competitor, Wizz Air.
But as the rights issue has got under way and the shares have continued to slide, some questions remain: mainly, 
what is easyJet going to do with all that money?
The fundraising was bigger than anything expected by the market. Some analysts thought it could raise perhaps 
£500-600m to firm up its balance sheet after the ravages of the pandemic, an amount that should have been 
enough to defend its investment-grade rating.
Putting some sort of buffer in place, at a point where the world is reopening rather than in crisis, is probably 
sensible: net debt had risen from £326m at the end of 2019 to more than £2bn at the end of the most recent 
quarter. It went into the pandemic with 70 per cent of its total fleet unencumbered, or available to raise financing 
against. That figure has fallen to 41 per cent.
But easyJet went for a much bigger raise in an issue priced at 410p, or a 35.8 per cent discount to the theoretical 
exrights price. According to analysts at
EasyJet 's £1.2bn rights issue puts strategy in doubt
Bernstein, it was "unable to articulate convincingly what the money was for".
With close to £3bn in liquidity, consensus was that easyJet had funds on hand as travel gets going; it still expects to 
run close to 60 per cent of 2019 capacity in the fourth quarter.
One possibility is that it sees a longer, and more painful, recovery than its rivals and the market. EasyJet has 
argued that the rights issue will get it back to where it was pre-pandemic, a robust position in an unpredictable 
industry and one that served it well in the past year.
It is more exposed to the UK market than lower-cost peers, where constantly changing travel rules have held back 
air travel and a winter lockdown isn't ruled out. Another explanation is that it wants to bring forward orders of new 
aircraft, something it suggested wasn't currently planned.
Other opportunities identified around ancillary revenues or buying slots don't require big sums.
Some industry stalwarts argue that, as an "inbetweener" airline, easyJet has a strategic problem. Former British 
Airways boss Alex Cruz has described that as the "worst place to be now".
Reductions to the size of the fleet during the pandemic, in part under pressure from founder shareholder Stelios 
Haji-Ioannou, "leaves them less able to exploit opportunities" than rapidly expanding carriers such as Wizz and 
Ryanair, said industry consultant John Strickland.
On the other side, it must contend with state-backed legacy airlines, which could prove increasingly entrenched and 
irrational competitors.
The more immediate issue being faced by the airline is unease among some shareholders, those who have long 
supported its hybrid model of building hefty positions at prime, congested airports such as Gatwick and using them 
to take share away from higher-cost flag carriers.
In an asset-heavy business, "the most important job of an airline CEO is to allocate capital [well]", said Alex Irving at 
Bernstein. But the size of the raise has prompted questions about how the board and chief executive Johan 
Lundgren came to its decision, especially given the interest from Wizz.
One shareholder told the FT this week: "We are unhappy at the capital allocation framework the company has used 
to determine that a rights issue of such size and discount was optimum for shareholders versus the other options 
available to them."
EasyJet's move should eliminate any concerns about holes in its balance sheet, or indeed its ability to compete fully 
in a recovery. But Stephen Hester, the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss who will take over as chair in 
December, may still have a repair job on his hands. helen.thomas@ft.com

 Ryanair (RY4C.IR, RYA.L) intends to appoint about 5,000 staff members in Europe over the next five years as it 
recovers from the trading slump in COVID-19, according to a Tuesday release.
The move comes as the Ireland-based airline expects passenger numbers to almost double to 200 million annually 
by 2025 thanks to the addition of 210 737 Max narrow-bodies from Boeing (BOE.L).
As part of its expansion plan, Ryanair will also invest about 50 million euros ($59 million) to launch the new aviation 
training center in Santry, Ireland.
Ryanair's shares fell about 3%, while Boeing's shares declined over 1% on Tuesday's close.

Covid-19 boosters are to be offered to all vulnerable people and those aged over 50 six months after their second 
dose, Heath Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed this afternoon.
A plan B would be triggered if the NHS came under "unsustainable pressure", Javid added.
This would involve masks, potentially working from home and vaccine passports if needed.
Speaking to MPs, Javid said vaccinations were a fifth pillar of the government's plan to tackle coronavirus and that 
112,300 deaths, 143,600 hospitalisations and 24.7mln infections had been prevented so far by the 
current programme of jabs.
The UK has administered 92mln vaccine doses, data today revealed, with the jabs providing 95% protection against 
severe disease caused by coronavirus including the Delta variant.
Earlier, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JVCI) said its preference for the booster jab was the 
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) vaccine or alternatively a half-dose of Moderna's mRNA alternative.
Javid said that plan A for the government consisted of vaccines, including the first dose for 12-15 years and booster 
for the over-50s and vulnerable groups.
Other measures include test, trace and isolation with free PCR tests to continue: a £5.4bn payment to help the NHS 
with its Covid response; encouraging people still to meet outdoors and playing a key role in the international 
response.
Government reveals Plan B to tackle winter Covid
Javid also urged people to have normal flu jabs because of the potential additional pressure on health services that 
an outbreak might cause.
Earlier, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi had said that a coronavirus-linked lockdown would be considered only as 
a last resort,
He added the government has more tools at its disposal now to tackle the pandemic this time and much more 
information about the virus than at the start of the first lockdown.
Test and trace, surveillance and the vaccine programme were not available at the start of pandemic he said, adding 
he was confident that the infrastructure is in place to deal with any new major outbreak.
Hospitalisations have been steadily rising during the summer, principally among those yet to be vaccinated, as the 
Delta variant of the virus has spread rapidly.
Shares showed little reaction to the news ahead of the PM's update.
Pub, hotel and restaurant groups such as Whitbread, JD Wetherspoon and Mitchells and Butlers were all largely 
unchanged at 3,303p, 1,068p and 267p respectively.
Airlines, though, were weak even though the scrapping of the UK's traffic light travel system and an end of PCR 
tests for fully vaccinated passengers are expected to be part of the PM's speech.
Ryanair shed 1.3% to (EURO)15.70 and easyJet 0.6% to 586.2p.

EasyJet eyeing Gatwick slots if BA plan falters - report
EasyJet eyeing Gatwick slots if BA plan falters - report

EasyJet PLC is already planning what to do with the proceeds of its £1.2bn rights issue, according to reports.
The carrier announced the cash call last week alongside a statement that it had rejected a bid approach from rival 
Wizz Air.
At the time, Johan Lundgren, chief executive, said conditions at present are a "once in a lifetime opportunity".
"As the European aviation market recovers post-Covid-19, opportunities will arise at airports," the airline's 
statement added.
Reports today suggested the carrier is looking to buy up British Airway's slots at Gatwick if the FTSE 100 group's 
plans for a new low-cost carrier at the airport fail to materialise.
BA  needs an agreement with its unions on new working conditions and contract terms and has warned it will scrap 
its short-haul operation at Gatwick if it is blocked, potentially leaving its slots there up for grabs.
EasyJet is also said to eyeing expansion in France at Paris Orly, where AirFrance is expected to give up some slots 
as part of a deal for financial support from the French government, though more capacity in Germany is not being 
considered, said today's report.
Shares in easyJet today reflected the heavy discount its investors had to swallow to get its rights issue away.
Terms of the issue were a hefty 31 for 47 at a price of 410p, a 48% discount to the market price at the time with a 
theoretical ex-rights price in the prospectus of 638p.
EasyJet eyeing Gatwick slots if BA plan falters - report
The shares went ex-rights today and were trading at 583p, implying a drop of around 9% since Thursday's 
announcement, though the shares were up about 1.3% today.
EasyJet, Wizz Air merger a good idea says rival
Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary, meanwhile, has suggested that easyJet and Wizz Air merging is a good idea.
A combination between Wizz and easyJet would make sense given they both run all-Airbus fleets and work in 
largely separate geographies, he told the FT.
If they don't, he sees a possible situation where both are bought by bigger rivals such as IAG, which owns British 
Airways and Iberia.
O'Leary also warned that airfares will be "dramatically higher" next summer once demand returns to normal.
There will be huge demand for holidays, he says with fewer flights causing a surge in prices for holidaymakers.
"I think there will be a dramatic recovery in holiday tourism within Europe next year. And the reason why I think 
prices will be dramatically higher is that there's less capacity," O'Leary said.
"Take out Thomas Cook (6 mln seats), Flybe - (8 mln seats), Norwegian (nearly 24mln seats) - Alitalia's reducing its 
fleet by 40%t. There is going to be about 20% less short-haul capacity in Europe in 2022 with a dramatic recovery 
in demand," he told reporters.
Shares in Ryanair rose 2% to (EURO)15.80 and IAG 0.3% to 145.7p.

9 new routes from Milan & 800 new jobs in Italy
Ryanair, Italy's No.1 airline, today (8th Sept) announced its Winter 2021 schedule from its two Milan airports - 
Bergamo and Malpensa - opening 9 new routes (125 total routes) - connecting Milan to more exciting European 
destinations from October. As travel recovers to pre-Covid levels, Ryanair's growth continues to lead air traffic and 
tourism recovery in Milan. Ryanair will deliver over 800 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers in Italy this 
Winter as it gears up for post-Covid growth in S2022
Italian citizens / visitors can now book a well-deserved Autumn break to one of Ryanair's 9 new routes from 
Bergamo and Malpensa to exciting cities such as Helsinki, Malta, Naples and Stockholm. To celebrate, Ryanair has 
launched a (EURO)19.99 seat sale for travel until the end Nov 2021, which must be booked by midnight Friday, 
10th September on www.Ryanair.com
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
"As Italy's largest airline, Ryanair is committed to recover Milan's tourism industry, jobs and connectivity as we grow 
across Europe and recover air travel to pre-Covid levels. As Ryanair takes delivery of 55 new B737-8200 
'Gamechanger' aircraft this Winter, we are delighted to announce that a number of these new aircraft will be based 
at our 2 Milan airports, delivering 9 new routes from Bergamo and Malpensa and creating over 800 jobs in Italy this 
Winter.
Italian air traffic led by Ryanair, will recover strongly this Winter and we are pleased to announce our new Milan 
Winter schedule, which will operate flights to 125 destinations (including 9 new routes) to over 30 countries.
As consumer confidence returns, we call on the Italian Government to scrap the municipal tax for all Italian airports, 
which is damaging to the competitiveness of Italian airports versus their European counterparts. The axing of this 
tax would facilitate to a rapid recovery in Italian air traffic, tourism and jobs thanks to Ryanair's low fares and long-
term growth plan."

Wizz Air Holdings has been in talks with Airbus about a new order for at least 100 A320neo Family jets for several 
months and is reportedly nearing a final deal, sources told Reuters news agency.
Both the low-cost carrier and the manufacturer refused to comment.
Wizz Air is aggressively expanding, hoping to increase its market share as the European aviation industry recovers 
from the COVID-19 pandemic. The group's current fleet comprises sixty-four A320-200s, six A320-200Ns, forty-one 
A321-200s, and thirty-five A321-200NXs split between its Wizz Air, Wizz Air UK, and Wizz Air Abu Dhabi AOCs. It 
has orders for a further thirty-four A320-200Ns, 181 A321-200NXs, and twenty A321-200NX(XLR)s due directly 
from the Airbus.
Recently, the Hungarian low-cost carrier unsuccessfully attempted to buy easyJet.
The news about Wizz Air's potential order comes shortly after Ryanair Holdings publicly ended its talks with Boeing 
over a new order for B737-10s due to a purported lack of agreement on pricing.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary believes rivals Wizz Air and easyJet will need to merge or be taken out by other 
carriers as the airline industry consolidates following the pandemic.
EasyJet revealed on Thursday it had rebuffed a takeover approach from an unnamed suitor, which a person familiar 
with the talks confirmed was Wizz
Air. The approach is the first sign of dealmaking in a European industry that has suffered 18 months of disruption 
and long been seen as ripe for consolidation. "Both easyJet and Wizz will either need to be taken out or ... coalesce 
together," O'Leary told the Financial Times. He suggested that large flag carriers, such as the British Airways owner 
IAG, Lufthansa or Air France, could eventually try to buy rivals, be they lowcost or smaller network airlines.
"Consolidation needs to happen and will happen. It's an inevitability, particularly coming out of Covid," he added.
O'Leary says airlines need huge scale to survive, and that the fragmented European market is unsustainable in the 
long term.
Following the interest in his airline, easyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren also said the pandemic could drive 
industry tie-ups in Europe. "I think that everybody would agree that when you go through situations like this, that 
there are consolidation plays happening," he said on Thursday.
Ryanair chief says rivals will need to merge Travel& leisure O'Leary claims easyJet and Wizz Air must join 
forces or be taken over
For O'Leary, a combination between Wizz and easyJet would make sense given they both run all-Airbus fleets and 
work in largely separate geographies.
A play for easyJet would have given ambitious Wizz an immediate large footprint in western Europe, a region it is 
slowly moving into after growing through its home market of eastern Europe over the past 15 years.
But, like Ryanair, it has built a formidable operating model by keeping its own operating costs very low. A tie-up with 
easyJet would bring with it higher costs and the need to operate from more expensive airports.
"The question would be, would Wizz improve easyJet's costs, or will easyJet's costs destroy Wizz's cost base?" 
O'Leary said.
Ryanair was not interested in M&A at the moment, O'Leary said, because he feared this would disrupt his airline's 
fearsomely efficient business model.
Still, he revealed that he made multiple attempts to buy Wizz Air from its founding American investor Bill Franke in 
the years before it listed in London in 2015. "I tried to buy Wizz three or four times off him, but we could never agree 
a price," he said.
He said he was no longer interested given Wizz's market capitalisation of about £5.5bn.
Wizz Air and easyJet declined to comment.

Investor confidence in the UK fell by 4% in September compared to August, This compares to a 4% rise in August

already hit out at post-Brexit immigration rules, which have exacerbated the shortage of HGV drivers. 
Investor Confidence In The UK Market Has Fallen 
These concerns are reflected in the HL investor confidence survey which showed confidence in the UK market has 
fallen by 4% and by 5% for the US in September. Higher prices alongside a weaker recovery[7], as evidence in 
recent US jobs data and also the UK's GDP reading for July is leading to fears of a stagflation scenario emerging. 
Ryanair's warning that prices will rise next year due to fewer flights, inflation and higher taxes did little to relieve the 
pain of rival easyJet. Shares plummeted again falling by 15% in early trading after warnings that it is likely to take 
longer to recover than its competitors. British Airways owner IAG struggled to stay positive, as the cloud of 
uncertainty remains over the UK's traffic light system which has been blamed for dampening consumer demand. 
But Ryanair's shares rose after indication the company will keep prices low over the next few months to win market 
share from beleaguered rivals. 
 Investor confidence in Japan has surged after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced he was stepping down. 
There's hope a new leader will get a handle on soaring infection rates which has prompted the introduction of a 
state of emergency. The spectre of inflation though is also hovering with wholesale price increases at almost 13 
year highs. Companies will be under pressure to pass on costs to customers, but with consumer demand already 
weak, that could act as a further drag on the economy[8]. This is far from a pure Japanese dilemma. The tricky 
tightrope between absorbing higher costs, to keep demand buoyant and increasing prices, to maintain margins is 
one which many companies will be trying to balance on in the months to come."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael O'Leary has warned that prices will increase as passengers 
rush to holiday in Europe next summer.
O'Leary said this huge demand for holidays would coincide with fewer flights, meaning a price rise for flights and 
also for hotels.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, he said: "I think there will be a dramatic recovery in holiday tourism within 
Europe next year. And the reason why I think prices will be dramatically higher is that there's less capacity.
"Take out Thomas Cook, Flybe, Norwegian – Alitalia's reducing its fleet by 40%. There is going to be about 20% 
less short-haul capacity in Europe in 2022 with a dramatic recovery in demand."
Ryanair prices will be cut this winter, to "grab market share everywhere", O'Leary said.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said M&A deals in Europe's airline industry are bound to happen 
as more countries come out of the pandemic. 
Speaking to London's Financial Times for a Sept. 11 report, O'Leary said easyJet (EZJ.L) and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) 
"need to be taken out or coalesce together," after it was recently revealed that the former rejected merger talks with 
the latter. 
On the other hand, O'Leary said Ryanair is  not interested in such deals but said he offered to buy Wizz Air "three 
or four times" before its 2015 IPO.

Press freedoms crumble as authoritarianism spreads

Sep 12, 2021( Axios: https://link.axios.com/join/am-signup?source=aci Delivered by Newstex)  
 The press is being pulverized in places where democracy is deteriorating, leaving the world with little visibility into 
how those regions are transforming under authoritarian rule.  
Why it matters: The COVID-19 pandemic was already taking a huge toll[1] on press freedoms around the world. A 
new wave of geopolitical tension is exacerbating the issue. 
Driving the news: In Hong Kong last week, Next Digital, a media company founded by press tycoon Jimmy Lai, said 
it was shutting down in response to new Chinese Communist Party restrictions that made it impossible to continue 
operating. "The climate of fear is unbelievable," said Mark Clifford, an independent non-executive director of Next 
Digital's board. Clifford and other members of the board resigned, citing that environment. "It's not a kleptocracy, 
like Russia. They don't want money. They just really want to silence this voice," he continued. Beijing regulators 
essentially made it impossible for the company to operate financially. The move has shattered hope among press 
activists that a vibrant free press ecosystem will ever be able to exist in Hong Kong, following the passage of a 
sweeping national security law[2] imposed by Beijing that dramatically reduces personal freedoms. Lai, who was 
sentenced to 14 months in prison earlier this year, was one of the most vocal pro-democracy voices in Hong Kong 
for years. His newspaper, Apple Daily — the biggest publication within Next Digital — shut down[3] in June after 
authorities froze the bank accounts for the paper and arrested its top leadership. Clifford said Apple Daily sold over 
1 million copies on its last day publishing. The big picture: Hong Kong isn't alone. Around the world, several 
countries that were hinging on democracy have seen press freedoms fall apart this past year in response to rising 
authoritarian regimes. Afghanistan, which saw a vibrant press scene grow over the past two decades, has been 
radically transformed by the Taliban takeover last month. "Less than a month after taking power, the Taliban seem 
to be letting their masks fall," said[4] Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Christophe Deloire, citing reports 
that the Taliban has been beating and arresting journalists. Belarus: Belarusian President Alexandre Lukashenko 
has in the past year taken drastic new measures to target the press, including drastic changes[5] to the country's 
media laws that make it much harder for journalists to report. His war on journalism made global headlines[6] in 
May after leaders used a supposed bomb threat to ground a Ryanair flight carrying an opposition journalist. Amid 
the pandemic, several countries, like Hungary and the Philippines, introduced "fake news" laws[7] to curb the 
spread of social media. Such efforts, experts argue, are not meant to quell misinformation, but rather are used to 
empower autocrats. Leaders of counties like Turkey and Brazil have introduced similar measures. What's next: 
Press freedoms crumble as authoritarianism spreads
Press experts argue that the rhetoric from the Trump administration inspired other world leaders looking to 
consolidate power to target the press. The world will be looking to the Biden administration to play a leading role in 
setting a tone around what the U.S. will deem acceptable. While the Biden administration has pledged transparency 
domestically, it has also faced some challenges in trying to establish itself as a leader on press freedoms. Press 
activists condemned[8] the administration's decision earlier this year not to sanction the Saudi crown prince 
Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist and American citizen Jamal Khashoggi. Go deeper: Journalists 
face record levels of persecution globally[9]Global press freedom deteriorates amid pandemic[10]"Fake news" laws 
on the rise globally during the coronavirus[11]

British Airways-owner IAG target price cut to reflect increasing rights issue risk, says Credit Suisse
British Airways-owner IAG target price cut to reflect increasing rights issue 
risk, says Credit Suisse

It is increasingly likely that British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) SA 
(LSE:IAG) will raise equity, according to Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS.), which has reduced its target price on the airline 
to 195p from 256p to reflect this risk.
The new target price is based on the assumption of a similarly sized and priced rights issue to the (EURO)2.7bn at 
92 cents per share IAG launched in 2020, the Swiss broker said.
At the time of last year's equity raising, IAG said it seeking to offset its net debt build up. Credit Suisse said its 
analysis assumes net debt of (EURO)13.5bn at end-December 2021, (EURO)6bn above the (EURO)7.6bn reported 
for end-2019.
Although IAG has said it is comfortable with liquidity and has ample access to reasonable-priced aircraft financing, 
the broker said it believes it is "prudent to factor in a degree of dilution risk" in the target price.
Credit Suisse has retained its 'Outperform' rating on IAG.
"We are conscious that until the transatlantic market re-opens unfettered, the IAG investment case will remain 
challenging, however we retain an Outperform rating as we continue to see it as one of the best ways to play 
ultimate air travel recovery across the value chain", alongside Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), Wizz Air Holdings 
(AIM:WIZZ) PLC, Airbus Group (EPA:AIR) and Aena SME SA, the broker said.

British Airways owner IAG is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, as travel stocks were among the most 
volatile of sectors in the past week.
Today, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS.) cut its share price target on IAG to 195p from 256p, on "increasing rights issue 
risk", following the heavily discounted cash call by budget airline easyJet this week.
"We think it is getting increasingly likely IAG looks to raise equity," the analysts said and, though they have not yet 
changed their financial forecasts, the price target was lopped to "reflect the risk of shareholder dilution".
The number-crunchers said they "are conscious that until the transatlantic market re-opens unfettered, the IAG 
investment case will remain challenging, however we retain an Outperform rating as we continue to see it as one of 
the best ways to play ultimate air travel recovery across the value chain (alongside names such as Ryanair, Wizz 
Air, Airbus, Aena also under our coverage)."
3.15pm:
Arkle Resources PLC (AIM:ARK) shares leapt like their thoroughbred namesake, up 50% to 1.2p, after announcing 
results from the latest drillholes at the company's 100% gold project in Ireland.
Chairman John Teeling described the results from Hole 7 as "spectacular", with grades including 51.6 grammes of 
gold per tonne the highest discovered at the Mine River project.

While laboratory analysis it awaited, he reported "good indications" in Holes 8 and 9, where the targets are an 
extension of the gold zone and to look for gold veins between 50 and 200 metres.  
"Visual observation shows the mineralisation we are looking for both above and below 100 metres. The core is in 
the laboratory," he said.
11.50am: Caracal cracking on
Caracal Gold plc (LSE:GCAT) (LSE:GCAT), which is still going under its former name of Papillon Holdings PLC 
(LSE:PPHP) on many websites, is another riser on Friday morning, with its shares up 8% to 1.43p after saying it 
has "hit the ground running across every aspect of our gold mining and exploration business" after last month's 
reverse takeover deal.
The deal saw Mayflower Gold Investments reverse into listed Papillon, bringing the ownership of Kenya's 
Kilimapesa gold mining and processing operations back to the public markets, having formerly been owned by 
Goldplat PLC (AIM:GDP).
Robbie McCrae, chief exectuvie of Caracal, said "excellent progress is being made" at Kilimapesa, where the 
company is looking to increase gold production to 25,000oz per year.
He said a recent agreement to connect the plant to the grid power was a "key achievement" as it would "deliver 
major cost savings and improved economics, but it also strengthens our ESG credentials given Kenya's advanced 
stance on the use of renewable energy". 
"Additionally, our exploration programmes aimed at increasing our JORC compliant resources to +2Moz are also 
making headway, with initial trenching of shallow open pit areas initiated, the acquisition of our own RC and DD

Tanfield Group (AIM:TAN) PLC led the early risers on Friday, climbing 30% to 3p on the back of its half-year 
results, where it provided an update on US and UK legal proceedings.
The AIM-listed company, which used to be focused on electric vehicles, has for some years now been an 
investment company with a single principal investment: a 49% share of aerial work platform company Snorkel, 
which is valued on its books at £19.1mln.
Having been sued in 2019 in the US by Extreme, the majority owner of Snorkel since 2013, and issued its own 
claim in the English courts against its lawyers in the 2013 deal, Tanfield said "both the US and UK Proceedings are 
continuing to progress and [...] the board believes a positive outcome to either/both proceedings is possible".
"So far as it is necessary, the company will continue to vigorously defend and advance its position in both 
proceedings, whilst continuing to seek advice."
Tanfield said it continues to receive the support of its shareholders via loan note subscriptions in order to provide 
the necessary legal funding and day-to-day costs, though its operating loss in the period reduced to £0.19mln from 
£0.33mln as a consequence of lower legal fees during the period.
Elsewhere, shares in One Media iP Group PLC (AIM:OMIP, FRA:1M9) stomped and twirled higher after saying it 
had snapped up the rights to more songs penned by soul and high energy legend Ian Levine.
The latest batch includes a new recording deal Levine made with multimillion-selling artist Evelyn Thomas who 
topped the charts with 'High Energy' in 1984, with the pair now working on three new recordings due to be released 
before Christmas.

One Media said it will represent both artist and producer on the publishing to the new tracks, adding it is the first 
time Levine and Thomas have collaborated on music together in 33 years.

easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ)'s recovery is likely to lag that of its competitors Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and Wizz 
Air Holdings (AIM:WIZZ) PLC, according to UBS.
Its fellow budget carriers may return to pre-pandemic traffic levels since they are not so focused on the UK.
READ: easyJet PLC shares hit turbulence after it rejects bid approach and launches £1.2bn rights issue
easyJet has low visibility in the short term, plus it is not helped by costly COVID-19 tests hitting demand.
The Swiss bank reckons that the £1.2bn rights issue will lead to fewer questions around the balance sheet, 
however, the share count could increase by nearly two thirds.
This will lead to significant dilution once the airline returns to profit, which might weigh on market sentiment, but 
some City watchers think it could not be helped.
"If easyJet wanted to have a chance of emerging from the COVID-19 crisis with a similar amount of financial 
leverage to that with which it went in, then a raise of this kind of magnitude (£1.2bn) was always going to be 
required," analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) said.
"Given the uncertainties that remain in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, we can understand management's 
desire to 'protect easyJet's long-term positioning in the EU aviation sector' and therefore to act now."

According to Barclays, the extra cash will allow easyJet to weather a slower traffic recovery as well as pursuing 
growth opportunities, including new slots at core airports (Orly, Schiphol, Gatwick and Linate) and potential fleet 
expansion.
The London bank still prefers Ryanair and Wizz Air, as they offer "attractive growth and balance sheet strength 
similar to easyJet post-rights issue".
Shares in easyJet dipped 2% to 691.45p on Friday morning, while Ryanair and Wizz Air both shed 1% to 
(EURO)15.62 and 4,840p respectively.

2020. REUTERS/Andrew Boyers/File Photo
Europe's no-frills airlines are heralding a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grab market share from traditional carriers 
struggling to emerge from the pandemic, but each will have to overcome significant challenges to come out on top.
Market leader Ryanair (RYA.I) this week saw talks over a mega-plane deal fall apart, while No.2 easyJet (EZJ.L) is 
lagging the recovery of its rivals so far.
Smaller Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) has had an audacious bid for easyJet rejected, sources say, a move that would create a 
much stronger challenger to Ryanair if a deal could be done, but which some analysts think could be a distraction at 
a time of rapid change.
At stake is potentially the biggest reshaping of Europe's aviation industry for a generation, with low-cost airlines 
looking to outmanoeuvre heavily indebted traditional carriers as COVID-19 travel restrictions are wound down.
Ireland's Ryanair, with 150 million passengers in the year before the pandemic and 200 Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX 
jets on order, had until this week looked set to extend its lead to the end of the decade with a deal for up to 250 
more.
But talks collapsed spectacularly on Monday, leaving boss Michael O'Leary - long wedded to both Boeing and a 
strategy of expanding organically - with few quick options to accelerate growth.
That put the spotlight on Jozsef Varadi, CEO of Hungarian upstart Wizz Air, who sources say has made two bold 
moves to seize the initiative. read more
Wizz, which flew just 40 million passengers at its pre-pandemic peak, is in talks to order at least 100 new Airbus 
(AIR.PA) jets in addition to the 268 strong fleet it is due to have by 2027, sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Sources also named Wizz as the mystery bidder behind a spurned approach to easyJet, which flew around 100 
million passengers a year before the pandemic.
Smaller Wizz Air's EasyJet bid kicks off scramble for budget airline supremacy
That would tear up Wizz's ultra-low cost gospel of internal expansion at all costs for the sake of a major, instant 
step-up in scale.
While easyJet said its suitor - which it did not name - was no longer interested, and Wizz declined to comment, the 
move highlighted the risks of easyJet's very different management approach.
EasyJet has long been a hybrid player, focused on undercutting legacy airlines at established airports, while Wizz 
and Ryanair shun most hubs and focus on pared back fares that exclude other costs like baggage - the "ultra-low-
cost" model.
But some feel easyJet's decision to shrink - it has reduced its fleet by 10% in response to the pandemic - may have 
left it exposed, making its strategy a tougher sell to investors than the growth stories of its rivals.
More reliant on Britain's slower travel recovery than most of the rest of Europe, easyJet is now also lagging the pick 
up in business at its main competitors.
EasyJet "are very different from what Wizz Air or Ryanair are offering the market at present. So in that sense they 
are kind of vulnerable as consolidation efforts occur post-COVID," said Joe Gill, head of origination at brokers 
Goodbody.
After rejecting the bid, easyJet plans to raise 1.2 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) to stay in the race by funding growth at 
airports. It now has to convince investors to double down on its more cautious strategy just as a bid raises the 
prospect of a bolder alternative. ($1 = 0.7208 pounds)
Investor meetings this week are trying to win shareholders over to a dilutive rights issue, the second time easyJet 
has asked for cash during the crisis. The first time, its top shareholder and founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou did not take 
part.
EasyJet says the funds will give it the firepower to grab slots at premium airports like Paris Orly, Lisbon, Milan 
Linate and London's Gatwick.
But investors will be aware that any further COVID-19 restrictions could lead to another wash-out winter, swiftly 
burning through the new money.
Industry sources say Varadi has long had easyJet in his sights. As well as creating a low-cost giant focused on 
Airbus planes, a combined Wizz-easyJet would add Wizz's low-cost bases in eastern Europe to prime easyJet hubs 
at Gatwick, as well as across France, Switzerland and elsewhere in western Europe.
"I think there is room for all three, but the question is, over time ... will Wizz come back again with another effort to 
deliver the consolidation which I think is practically inevitable," said aviation consultant John Strickland.
With few cards to play, O'Leary on Wednesday started a game of chicken with Boeing by threatening to forgo any 
new order from the U.S. planemaker for up to a decade - implying he could happily survive with the 650 or so jets 
he will have when current deliveries complete in 2025. read more
Observers see few alternatives to returning to the table with Boeing as relations with Airbus are strained and 
antitrust issues would likely preclude a bid for easyJet. In fact, O'Leary may welcome an easyJet tie-up as a 
distraction to Wizz.
"It would be good for Ryanair because it would put up Wizz's costs," said a senior industry source.
Fuelling the low-cost jostling is the fact the pandemic has tipped the industry balance in their favour and away from 
network carriers like Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA), British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE).
During the pandemic, a lower cost base and more flexible business model has better protected no-frills players, 
while difficulties restarting long-haul travel have deepened this advantage. read more

But the challenge for the budget brigade is to achieve growth in a way that does not dilute their cost advantage - 
either by overpaying for jets or acquiring a higher cost rival - a point made starkly by Wizz chairman and no-frills 
airline tycoon Bill Franke before the pandemic.
"Not staying disciplined about the business model and allowing other costs to leak in is the 'path to hell'," Franke 
told Reuters.

European aviation may be on the cusp of a new order.
The revelation yesterday of a bid by Wizz Air for rival budget carrier easyJet marks the first sign of a potential wave 
of consolidation in the region's airline industry as it emerges from the pandemic. The rejected offer highlights the 
tale of two carriers, both ambitious and hoping to expand.
But Wizz has been by far the most aggressive through the crisis, while easyJet yesterday also unveiled a new 
£1bn-plus rights issue to help heal its balance sheet for the post-Covid world.
Other airlines are also jostling for position, too, in what could be a fundamental reshaping of Europe's fragmented 
airline market, which had already experienced a clutch of bankruptcies before the coronavirus crisis.
British Airways, for example, has asked unions to back a plan to make sweeping changes to its short-haul Gatwick 
operations to match easyJet's more flexible and seasonal model.
In short, airlines are looking beyond the pandemic to prepare for a new business cycle, said Ross Harvey, an 
analyst at Davy Research. "The major carriers are now moving to position themselves for the post-Covid world."
Wave of mergers looms for Europe's carriers Hungarian group Wizz's bid for UK rival easyJet highlights 
potential power shift in region's pandemic-hit market
But it has been Wizz chief executive Jozsef Varadi and rival boss Michael O'Leary at Ryanair, who have been the 
most bullish, talking up their airlines as the potential winners in the post-pandemic endgame.
For Varadi, who founded Wizz Air nearly 20 years ago, growing the group from a start-up in Budapest in 2004 into 
Europe's third biggest low-cost airline, the crisis is a once in a generation opportunity to expand.
He has pushed to be allowed to scoop up more landing slots at London's Gatwick airport, taken on new aircraft and 
restored flying more aggressively than many of his competitors.
On its current flight schedules, Wizz will fly more people than in 2019 in the final three months of the year, 
according to aviation analysts at Goodbody. In contrast, easyJet expects to fly about two-thirds of normal capacity.
The story is mirrored in the markets, with easyJet shares trading at half their pre-pandemic levels, while Wizz's 
have completely recovered their coronavirus losses, hitting all-time highs this year. Wizz has now overtaken 
easyJet in size with a market capitalisation of £5bn against easyJet's £3.3bn.
In essence, the pandemic may force the European market, which still has a fleet of national flag carriers and 
lowcost competitors, to become more like the US, which has consolidated down to four main players.
"I think that everybody would agree that when you go through situations like this, that there are consolidation plays 
happening," easyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren said.
The move by Wizz - a person familiar with the talks confirmed they were the prospective bidder - also marks a 
significant escalation in the Hungarian airline's ambitions.
At a stroke the deal would have supercharged its acceleration into western Europe, giving it extra market share that 
would have taken years to grow organically, even as rivals retreat.
It would also take advantage of easyJet's still bombed out share price, a fact not lost on the company's leadership. 
The bid, said easyJet's Lundgren, "significantly undervalued" the group.
Yet, such a deal would also come with higher costs associated with easyJet's business that could undermine the 
Wizz's main selling point.
Backed by veteran American aviation veteran Bill Franke, one of the industry's most successful investors, the 
Hungarian airline's low cost base rivals Ryanair, the region's biggest budget airline.
Analysts at Bernstein this summer calculated that WDizz Air has even lower costs than Ryanair, although the Irish 
carrier's chief executive dismissed this as "bullshit" to the Financial Times.
And while easyJet's orange livery and the charismatic antics of its founder and largest shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou meant the carrier was the poster child of the no-frills airline revolution in the 1990s, it now offers a more 
expensive service as it aims to capture business from the national flag carriers at more expensive airports.
A deal would, therefore, have "undermined the purity and execution" that Wizz has demonstrated over the past 
decade as it has grown, while keeping costs down, said Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody.
For easyJet, the move suggests it may be vulnerable to a takeover as it occupies an uncomfortable position in the 
region between the budget airlines and the more expensive legacy carriers, but without their large intercontinental 
networks, one veteran airline executive said.
Speaking at an industry event in July, Franke himself said he believed "inbetweener" airlines which are neither flag 
carrier nor ultra-low cost faced problems as the industry emerges from the crisis.
"I think that's a difficult business model ... You do not want to end up in the middle," he said.
Wave of mergers looms for Europe's carriers Hungarian group Wizz's bid for UK rival easyJet highlights 
potential power shift in region's pandemic-hit market
The news of the approach also came with the announcement that easyJet was planning a £1.2bn rights issue and a 
new $400m revolving credit facility from its banks to strengthen its balance sheet.
This may at least give easyJet the firepower to take up opportunities presented by the pandemic, with analysts 
saying it has more than enough liquidity to survive an extended period of travel restrictions.
Significantly, Lundgren yesterday identified take-off and landing slots in cities across Europe including Paris and 
Amsterdam that have become available as other carriers retreat.
"I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity," he said.
The equity raise could have another positive impact for the group's leadership, diluting the shares of founder Sir 
Stelios, a constant thorn in the carrier's side over the past few years.
With a 25 per cent stake, he has waged a war against management and the board over the size of the airline's fleet. 
Last year he lost his attempt to oust four directors, including the airline's chair and chief executive.
But he is unlikely to participate in the heavily diluted equity raise and expects his stake to fall to about 15 per cent, a 
person familiar with his thinking told the FT, lessening his influence over the company.
In short, there are positives and negatives to be drawn from the latest M&A maneuverings for both Wizz and 
easyJet, with a European airline industry preparing for a new phase after the devastation caused by the pandemic.

With a 25 per cent stake, he has waged a war against management and the board over the size of the airline's fleet. 
Last year he lost his attempt to oust four directors, including the airline's chair and chief executive.
But he is unlikely to participate in the heavily diluted equity raise and expects his stake to fall to about 15 per cent, a 
person familiar with his thinking told the FT, lessening his influence over the company.
In short, there are positives and negatives to be drawn from the latest M&A maneuverings for both Wizz and 
easyJet, with a European airline industry preparing for a new phase after the devastation caused by the pandemic.

European aviation may be on the cusp of a new order.
The revelation yesterday of a bid by Wizz Air for rival budget carrier easyJet marks the first sign of a potential wave 
of consolidation in the region's airline industry as it emerges from the pandemic. The rejected offer highlights the 
tale of two carriers, both ambitious and hoping to expand.
But Wizz has been by far the most aggressive through the crisis, while easyJet yesterday also unveiled a new 
£1bn-plus rights issue to help heal its balance sheet for the post-Covid world.
Other airlines are also jostling for position, too, in what could be a fundamental reshaping of Europe's fragmented 
airline market, which had already experienced a clutch of bankruptcies before the coronavirus crisis.
British Airways, for example, has asked unions to back a plan to make sweeping changes to its short-haul Gatwick 
operations to match easyJet's more flexible and seasonal model.
In short, airlines are looking beyond the pandemic to prepare for a new business cycle, said Ross Harvey, an 
analyst at Davy Research. "The major carriers are now moving to position themselves for the post-Covid world."
Wave of mergers looms for Europe's carriers Hungarian group Wizz's bid for UK rival easyJet highlights 
potential power shift in region's pandemic-hit market
But it has been Wizz chief executive Jozsef Varadi and rival boss Michael O'Leary at Ryanair, who have been the 
most bullish, talking up their airlines as the potential winners in the post-pandemic endgame.
For Varadi, who founded Wizz Air nearly 20 years ago, growing the group from a start-up in Budapest in 2004 into 
Europe's third biggest low-cost airline, the crisis is a once in a generation opportunity to expand.
He has pushed to be allowed to scoop up more landing slots at London's Gatwick airport, taken on new aircraft and 
restored flying more aggressively than many of his competitors.
On its current flight schedules, Wizz will fly more people than in 2019 in the final three months of the year, 
according to aviation analysts at Goodbody. In contrast, easyJet expects to fly about two-thirds of normal capacity.
The story is mirrored in the markets, with easyJet shares trading at half their pre-pandemic levels, while Wizz's 
have completely recovered their coronavirus losses, hitting all-time highs this year. Wizz has now overtaken 
easyJet in size with a market capitalisation of £5bn against easyJet's £3.3bn.
In essence, the pandemic may force the European market, which still has a fleet of national flag carriers and 
lowcost competitors, to become more like the US, which has consolidated down to four main players.
"I think that everybody would agree that when you go through situations like this, that there are consolidation plays 
happening," easyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren said.
The move by Wizz - a person familiar with the talks confirmed they were the prospective bidder - also marks a 
significant escalation in the Hungarian airline's ambitions.
At a stroke the deal would have supercharged its acceleration into western Europe, giving it extra market share that 
would have taken years to grow organically, even as rivals retreat.
It would also take advantage of easyJet's still bombed out share price, a fact not lost on the company's leadership. 
The bid, said easyJet's Lundgren, "significantly undervalued" the group.
Yet, such a deal would also come with higher costs associated with easyJet's business that could undermine the 
Wizz's main selling point.
Backed by veteran American aviation veteran Bill Franke, one of the industry's most successful investors, the 
Hungarian airline's low cost base rivals Ryanair, the region's biggest budget airline.
Analysts at Bernstein this summer calculated that WDizz Air has even lower costs than Ryanair, although the Irish 
carrier's chief executive dismissed this as "bullshit" to the Financial Times.
And while easyJet's orange livery and the charismatic antics of its founder and largest shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou meant the carrier was the poster child of the no-frills airline revolution in the 1990s, it now offers a more 
expensive service as it aims to capture business from the national flag carriers at more expensive airports.
A deal would, therefore, have "undermined the purity and execution" that Wizz has demonstrated over the past 
decade as it has grown, while keeping costs down, said Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody.
For easyJet, the move suggests it may be vulnerable to a takeover as it occupies an uncomfortable position in the 
region between the budget airlines and the more expensive legacy carriers, but without their large intercontinental 
networks, one veteran airline executive said.
Speaking at an industry event in July, Franke himself said he believed "inbetweener" airlines which are neither flag 
carrier nor ultra-low cost faced problems as the industry emerges from the crisis.
"I think that's a difficult business model ... You do not want to end up in the middle," he said.

potential power shift in region's pandemic-hit market
The news of the approach also came with the announcement that easyJet was planning a £1.2bn rights issue and a 
new $400m revolving credit facility from its banks to strengthen its balance sheet.
This may at least give easyJet the firepower to take up opportunities presented by the pandemic, with analysts 
saying it has more than enough liquidity to survive an extended period of travel restrictions.
Significantly, Lundgren yesterday identified take-off and landing slots in cities across Europe including Paris and 
Amsterdam that have become available as other carriers retreat.
"I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity," he said.
The equity raise could have another positive impact for the group's leadership, diluting the shares of founder Sir 
Stelios, a constant thorn in the carrier's side over the past few years.
With a 25 per cent stake, he has waged a war against management and the board over the size of the airline's fleet. 
Last year he lost his attempt to oust four directors, including the airline's chair and chief executive.

EasyJet has rejected a takeover approach from rival Wizz Air, as the Hungarian carrier pursues an aggressive 
expansion into western Europe to take advantage of the worst crisis in the history of aviation.
UK-based easyJet said yesterday that it had received an approach in a "low premium and highly conditional" 
allshare deal, which the board "had no hesitation in rejecting".
The unsolicited approach was from Wizz Air, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Despite rejecting the approach, easyJet's leadership believes consolidation in the airline industry following the 
pandemic is inevitable, said a different person familiar with the situation. The company refuses to rule out M&A in 
the future, indicating that it might become a target or an acquirer, this person added.
The group revealed the approach as it announced a £1.2bn rights issue to help it through the crisis, which is set to 
dilute the influence of founder and top shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
Haji-Ioannou is unlikely to participate in the equity raise, which means his 25 per cent stake will be diluted, 
according to a person close to the businessman.
The news undermined the share price, which dropped 10.2 per cent in London yesterday.

With the company's stock at half its pre-pandemic price, the offer, which was made in the past few weeks, 
"significantly undervalued" the group, said Johan Lundgren, chief executive.
The carrier is no longer considering an offer, he added, stressing his confidence that easyJet can grow as the 
industry recovers from the pandemic.
EasyJet did not comment on who made the approach, and Wizz Air declined to comment.
A tie-up would have united two airlines that have pursued different strategies in the European short-haul market at a 
time when aviation is still reeling from the Covid-19 crisis.
Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air's chief executive, has promised to use the crisis to expand aggressively in western Europe.
The carrier has grown rapidly over the past 10 years through an ultra-efficient business model, including particularly 
low staffing costs. It is one of a few airlines with shares trading above their pre-pandemic levels.
In contrast, easyJet does not have the sort of ultra-low-cost base to match Wizz Air or Europe's other main budget 
airline Ryanair. It has shifted focus to winning market share from national flag carriers such as British Airways, Air 
France-KLM and Lufthansa.
The rights issue is a sign of the continuing stress for airlines, with the carrier hoping it will help withstand "potential 
prolonged market challenges", including the risk that travel restrictions last into 2022, the company said.
The rights issue is priced at 410p a share, representing a deep discount of 36 per cent on the airline's closing share 
price on Wednesday.
EasyJet lost more than £2bn during the crisis, including suffering its first annual loss in its 25-year history in 2020. 
The company expects to fly less than two-thirds of its normal flight schedule for the rest of the year.
It had access to £2.9bn of liquidity at the end of June, having raised more than £5.5bn since the crisis began, 
including a £400m share placing in June last year. See analysis and Lex

easyJet (U2, London Luton) is planning to raise around GBP1.49 billion pounds (USD2.05 billion) in fresh capital 
after rejecting a take-over offer from a third-party - reported by Reuters to be Wizz Air Holdings.
The UK-headquartered budget airline said in a stock exchange disclosure that its board had recently received an 
unsolicited preliminary takeover approach which took the form of a low premium and highly conditional all share 
transaction. After careful evaluation, it said, the board unanimously rejected the offer as, in their view, it 
"fundamentally undervalued" the airline holding. The bidder has since confirmed that it is no longer considering an 
offer for its rival which, had the merger been agreed to, would have helped create a rival to Ryanair (FR, Dublin 
Int'l), Europe's largest budget airline by market share and fleet size. Wizz Air did not comment on the report.
As it stands, easyJet is now pursuing a fully underwritten rights issuance in the hopes of raising GBP1.2 billion 
pounds (USD1.65 billion) as well as a new four-year senior secured revolving credit facility of USD400 million.
Proceeds will be used to help restore easyJet's balance sheet amid lingering affects from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It will also enhance the group's liquidity, and strengthen its credit ratios. To help tide itself through the crisis, 
easyJet has so far managed to access around GBP2.9 billion (USD4 billion) via term loans, revolving credit 
facilities, the UK government's Covid Corporate Financing Facility, bonds, and aircraft sales/lease-back 
transactions.
"The capital raise announced today not only strengthens our balance sheet enabling us to accelerate our post 
COVID 19 recovery plan but will also position us for growth so that we can take advantage of the strategic 
investment opportunities expected to arise as the European aviation industry emerges from the pandemic," Johan 
Lundgren, Chief Executive of easyJet, said.
"Since the onset of the pandemic, we have undertaken decisive and robust action to restructure our operations, 
addressed our cost base and secured our financial position, keeping our investment grade credit rating. We have 
worked hard to maintain our customer friendly brand and network and been rewarded with immediate growth in 
demand when travel restrictions have been lifted. This capital increase will allow us to build on our fundamental 
operational strengths and network strategy for our customers as well as accelerate long term value creation for our 
shareholders."

EasyJet (EZJ.L) has rejected a takeover approach from Wizz Air that would have created a low-cost airline to rival 
Ryanair, opting instead to raise $1.7 billion from shareholders and go it alone in an industry battling to recover from 
the pandemic.
EasyJet declined to name its suitor, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters it was Wizz Air (WIZZ.L). 
Wizz also declined to comment.
EasyJet said the all-share approach fundamentally undervalued its business, and added the potential bidder had 
since said it was no longer interested in a deal.
The approach was "highly conditional in its nature which made it very uncertain in terms of the deliverability," 
easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren told reporters, without giving details.
EasyJet said the fundraising, its second of the pandemic, would strengthen its balance sheet should the COVID-19 
downturn continue and allow it to operate more aggressively once the recovery arrives. It has identified landing 
slots across Europe it could acquire, including in Paris, Amsterdam and Milan.
"I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity," Lundgren said.
EasyJet, which during the pandemic sunk to its first ever annual loss and cut 4,500 jobs, wants to steal market 
share from legacy carriers like British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) and Air France-KLM (AIR.PA) as they retract 
their short-haul operations.
But it faces stiff competition from Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, and rapidly expanding Wizz, both of 
which have recovered faster than easyJet this year.
Wizz is strong in eastern European destinations like Poland and Romania, while easyJet is well-positioned in 
countries including Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and France. Adding to their potential good fit, both also 
operate all-Airbus (AIR.PA) fleets.
EasyJet rejects Wizz bid and raises $1.7 billion from shareholders
"EasyJet has always been a strategic target for Jozsef Varadi," said a senior industry source of the Wizz CEO.
Based on passenger data from last year, when fewer people travelled during the pandemic, a combination of the 
pair would still lag Ryanair by almost 20 million passengers.
Wizz, which counts aviation veteran Bill Franke as its chairman and his Indigo Partners as its biggest shareholder, 
has a market value of 5.1 billion pounds ($7 billion), while easyJet is worth 3.3 billion pounds. Its share price has 
also outperformed easyJet's.
Shares in Wizz had bounced back to pre-pandemic levels by November 2020 and hit an all-time high of 5,595 
pence in March. EasyJet's stock, by contrast, had recovered 70% of its pre-pandemic value by May 2021 before 
starting another decline.
Illustrating the ongoing travel slump, easyJet said that over July-September it expected its capacity to be about 57% 
of pre-pandemic levels. Ryanair flew around 75% of its normal passenger numbers in August, and Wizz flew over 
85% that month.
For the last three months of 2021 easyJet expects to fly up to 60% of 2019 levels, held back by Britain's slower 
return to international travel than the rest of Europe.
The drawn out recovery has already forced easyJet to raise 5.5 billion pounds from shareholders and debt markets, 
and by selling and leasing back aircraft. It also announced a new $400 million debt facility on Thursday. ($1 = 
0.7264 pounds)
In June 2020, easyJet raised 419 million pounds from investors, but its biggest shareholder, founder Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, did not participate. The new rights issue, raising 1.2 billion pounds, represents a 35.8% discount on the 
theoretical ex-rights price of 638 pence per share on Sept. 8.
Shares in easyJet, which were trading around 1,550 pence before the pandemic hit in early 2020, were down 10% 
at 710 pence at 1105 GMT, while Wizz was down 2%.
James Halstead, managing partner at consulting firm Aviation Strategy, said the takeover announcement would 
normally mean easyJet was in play, but there were few alternative buyers due to high industry debt levels and 
competition issues.
The rights issue is underwritten by BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Santander and Societe Generale.

Hungary's Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) is in negotiations with European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) over the purchase of at 
least 100 more narrowbody jets, industry sources said on Thursday.
Talks began several months ago and surfaced as Wizz Air emerged as a suitor for rival easyJet (EZJ.L) and as 
Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair (RYA.I), remained deadlocked with Boeing (BA.N) over a major jet 
purchase read more .
Analysts say all three major European budget airlines are forecast to expand as the COVID-19 crisis further erodes 
the finances of national legacy carriers.
Talks between Wizz Air and Airbus continued over the summer but the two sides are not yet ready to announce a 
deal, the sources said. Fleet purchase talks typically take months.
Any deal would involve at least 100 aircraft, one of the sources said.
Wizz Air, which has already ordered a total of 388 Airbus jets, declined to comment.
A spokesman for Airbus said it always talks to customers about their needs but never comments on such 
discussions.
Britain's easyJet said earlier it had rejected a takeover approach, opting instead to raise $1.7 billion from 
shareholders and go it alone in an industry battling to recover from the pandemic.
EasyJet declined to name its suitor, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters it was Wizz Air (WIZZ.L). Both 
airlines declined to comment.

 The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada and Switzerland have adopted or expanded 
sanctions against Belarus, and the Alexander Lukashenko regime. 
President Biden issued a new executive order that expanded U.S. sanctions authority against Belarus, authorizing 
the designation of government officials, oligarchs and various companies linked to the Lukashenko regime[1]. The 
expanded sanctions authority now encompasses various sectors, including defense, energy, security, 
transportation, cigarette manufacturing, and construction. OFAC expects to implement a broad set of sanctions 
across the Belarus economy[2]. 
The United Kingdom also imposed restrictions including prohibitions on technology, software, dual-use goods, oil 
and gas and tobacco products. The UK prohibitions apply in the territory of UK and all UK persons and companies 
wherever located[3]. 
The EU imposed new restrictions on aviation, and prohibitions on trade in technology items, including artificial 
intelligence and software products.[4] Earlier in the summer, the EU adopted a broad range of sectoral sanctions 
against Belarus. 
Canada adopted revised sanctions relating to securities, money market instruments, debt and various financial 
transactions, along with a robust set of restrictions on oil and gas products. 
Finally, Switzerland introduced new trade prohibitions in the financial sector and products used to monitor internet 
and telephone communications. 
OFAC took immediate steps under the new executive order to sanction 23 individuals and 21 entities, many of 
whom were involved in the crackdown on protesters after last year's disputed election and the government's forced 
United States and Global Community Adopt Broad Sanctions Targeting Belarus (Part III of IV)
landing of a Ryanair flight in May. OFAC announced the new sanctions by stressing that the action was 
unprecedented in scope against Belarus. 
OFAC's sanctions specifically target oligarchs connected to Lukashenko's regime - individuals and entities that 
continue to finance the Lukashenko regime through corrupt activities. These sanctions include oligarch Mikalai 
Varabei and associated companies, former government official Aliaksey Aleksin and associated companies. 
OFAC also sanctioned two major government-owned entities: Belaruskali OAO, a top global producer of fertilizer 
ingredient potassium chloride, and Grodno Tobacco Factory Neman, a tobacco factory and 'major source' of illegal 
cigarettes in the European Union. OFAC issued a general license involving Belaruskali OAO authorizing individuals 
and companies 120 days to wind down transactions. 
The U.S. and international set of sanctions are intended to pressure Belarus to allow an international investigation 
of the Ryanair flight diversion, to release political prisoners, and to refrain from targeting activists who are 
demanding free and fair elections.

Ryanair set to sell 1m shares purchased by non-EU nationals Airlines

Ryanair has warned that it will begin selling the shares of some of its UK investors after they broke its ownership 
rules that shifted after Brexit. The Irish carrier said yesterday that it had appointed a broker to begin the forced sale 
of around 1m shares purchased this year by non-EU nationals, mainly UK nationals or institutions that bought the 
stock on their behalf.
The airline has been forced into the drastic action by the UK's departure from the Single Market at the start of the 
year.
EU rules demand that airlines based in the bloc be majority-owned and controlled by nationals of the bloc, 
Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein. This enables airlines to fly freely between two destinations within EU 
borders.
For nearly 20 years, Ryanair has barred non-EU individuals from buying shares in the company and reiterated its 
stance in the run-up to Britain's departure. Institutions and individuals in the the UK have been prevented from 
buying new shares since the start of the www.year.UK shareholders who had held stock before January have been 
able to keep their holdings but are barred from attending or voting at annual meetings. The total held by UK 
investors amounts to a fraction of the more than 1.1bn Ryanair shares available on the market.
Ryanair warned investors in February to begin disposing of their stock to comply with its rules. The airline said 
yesterday that the appointed broker would sell their shares in the market over the coming weeks, "independently of, 
and uninfluenced by, the company".
Ryanair set to sell 1m shares purchased by non-EU nationals Airlines
It said: "The net proceeds of such sale(s) will be transmitted to the relevant investors in due course." It could begin 
further forced share sales "from time to time" in the future without warning.
The UK's departure, and the lateness of the UK-EU trade agreement, left airlines scrambling to ensure they 
complied with the changing standards. Wizz Air also disfranchised UK shareholders.
The UK and EU agreed in December's trading agreement to explore liberalising airline ownership rules to ease the 
burden on the industry but are yet to announce any changes.
The ownership rules have been one of the most significant hurdles the aviation industry faced since Brexit, which 
has also thrown up operational challenges for larger participants such as Ryanair.
Smaller aviation companies have complained that red tape, including the need to apply for permits for non-
scheduled flights, have hit their businesses.
Ryanair did not disclose whether the forced sales applied to institutional or individual investors but one analyst said 
it would be a surprise if institutional investors had missed the rules.
Investors from outside the EU are still able to trade Ryanair shares on Nasdaq as global depositary receipts.

Italy's government breached EU stateaid rules when it gave (EURO)900m in rescue loans to Alitalia in 2017, 
according to a verdict set to be announced by Brussels.
The decision by EU competition authorities, which two people with direct knowledge of the matter said would be 
made public today, comes after a three-year investigation into whether bridge loans to Alitalia illegally distorted 
competition in the bloc.
EU law prohibits a member state from granting a company financial support that gives it an advantage over its 
rivals.
The current Italian government, which was not in office when the loans were made, declined to comment.
The decision spells the latest ignominious chapter for Alitalia, Italy's perennially lossmaking flag carrier for 75 years. 
The Rome government has already been working with Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, on a deal to 
allow a new airline to be created that will be independent of Alitalia.
Brussels will confirm today the details of the new airline, known as Italia Transporto Aereo (ITA), which will start 
flying next month.
ITA will be economically independent and will not be liable for any illegal state aid received by Alitalia in recent 
years, people with direct knowledge of the plans said.

The new carrier will be able to buy part of Alitalia's fleet and a reduced number of landing slots as part of the deal 
stuck between Italy and Brussels to allow the new company to operate, these people added.
ITA will also be able to bid for the right to trade under the name Alitalia.
Alitalia has faced financial difficulties for decades and has not posted an annual net profit since the start of the 
millennium.
Rome took full control of the airline during the Covid-19 pandemic with aviation hit by strict curbs on travel to control 
the spread of the virus.
Other European governments also put funds into national carriers during the pandemic.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, compared Germany's Lufthansa to a "crack cocaine junkie".
Brussels is still to rule on a separate (EURO)400m government loan given to Alitalia to help it streamline its 
operations as it tried to sell assets in 2019. Opening that inquiry last year, the commission raised "serious doubts" 
that the aid was in line with state aid rules.
This year, Mario Draghi, Italy's prime minister, joked that he considered Alitalia "a family thing, a little expensive", 
referring to its emotional connection with Italians as well as its sizeable losses.

The current Italian government, which was not in office when the loans were made, declined to comment.
The decision spells the latest ignominious chapter for Alitalia, Italy's perennially lossmaking flag carrier for 75 years. 
The Rome government has already been working with Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, on a deal to 
allow a new airline to be created that will be independent of Alitalia.
Brussels will confirm today the details of the new airline, known as Italia Transporto Aereo (ITA), which will start 
flying next month.
ITA will be economically independent and will not be liable for any illegal state aid received by Alitalia in recent 
years, people with direct knowledge of the plans said.
Rome's rescue of Alitalia breached rules on state aid, says EU Airlines
The new carrier will be able to buy part of Alitalia's fleet and a reduced number of landing slots as part of the deal 
stuck between Italy and Brussels to allow the new company to operate, these people added.
ITA will also be able to bid for the right to trade under the name Alitalia.
Alitalia has faced financial difficulties for decades and has not posted an annual net profit since the start of the 
millennium.
Rome took full control of the airline during the Covid-19 pandemic with aviation hit by strict curbs on travel to control 
the spread of the virus.
Other European governments also put funds into national carriers during the pandemic.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, compared Germany's Lufthansa to a "crack cocaine junkie".
Brussels is still to rule on a separate (EURO)400m government loan given to Alitalia to help it streamline its 
operations as it tried to sell assets in 2019. Opening that inquiry last year, the commission raised "serious doubts" 
that the aid was in line with state aid rules.
This year, Mario Draghi, Italy's prime minister, joked that he considered Alitalia "a family thing, a little expensive", 
referring to its emotional connection with Italians as well as its sizeable losses.

Britain's controversial Covid-19 travel traffic light system might be scrapped as early as next month.
A new system based around the vaccination status of travellers rather than the status of a country being visited is 
under consideration by ministers, according to reports this morning.  
It will mean the end of the widely criticised green and amber categories but those visiting countries classified as red 
or the highest risk will still have to quarantine in government-run hotels on returning to the UK.
For people who have already received two doses of a vaccine and visiting what are now classified as green or 
amber countries, the process is likely to remain largely unchanged.
In these cases, travellers will require pre-departure tests and a PCR test within two days of returning to the UK.
How people yet to be vaccinated will be treated is unclear.
Paul Charles, head of travel PR firm The PCAgency tweeted "Scrapping of traffic light system would be a relief to 
pretty well everyone and herald a "living with an endemic" approach rather than blanket country measures. Would 
be a relief to countries in Africa, South America, Asia which don't deserve to be red-listed."
Airlines and travel companies have been persistent critics of the traffic light system, especially the sudden changes 
of status in countries and confusion over categories such as amber plus, where a country might be upgraded to red 
if infections continue to rise.
End of traffic light system in sight as airlines get wish
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) sued the government in June over the system alongside Stansted airport owner 
Manchester Airports Group and several other carriers.
"The UK's traffic light system has been a complete shambles from the beginning," said Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary at the time.
"This go-stop-go-stop policy is causing untold damage to the aviation industry and frustrating and upsetting millions 
of British families when they see their holiday plans and family visits disrupted by the government's 
mismanagement of international travel."
A review of the traffic light system and Covid travel arrangements was already scheduled by the government for 1 
October, which also coincides with the end of the vaccination programme with everyone over 18 to have been 
offered two jabs by then.
Shares in easyJet PLC rose 1.6% to 790.4p and Ryanair by 1.6% to (EURO)16.16.

Ryanair calls off Boeing talks over B737 MAX 10 order
Ryanair calls off Boeing talks over B737 MAX 10 order

Ryanair Holdings has announced it has ended negotiations with Boeing over a potential B737-10 order due to a 
lack of agreement on pricing.
"We are disappointed we couldn't reach agreement with Boeing on a B737 MAX 10 order. However, Boeing has a 
more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not paying high 
prices for aircraft," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
"Ryanair is a long-standing partner. We value their business and are committed to supporting them. At the same 
time, we continue to be disciplined and make decisions that make sense for our customers and our company," a 
Boeing spokesperson told Reuters.
The Irish holding has been hinting at a potential incremental order for up to 250 B737 MAX 10s since 2019. In early 
2020, O'Leary indicated that a deal could be reached as part of a compensation package for the delayed deliveries 
of its B737-8-200s. However, formal talks only started in late 2020 and lasted around 10 months, Ryanair said.
O'Leary stressed that Ryanair Holdings has enough aircraft on firm orders to secure its capacity needs through 
2025. Following an agreement reached in December 2020, the group increased its commitment for the B737-8-
200s - a higher-capacity derivative of the B737-8 for which Ryanair is one of only two customers in the world 
besides VietJetAir - to 210 units. After a number of delays caused by first, the grounding of the entire B737 MAX 
Family and then slow type certification of the -200 variant, deliveries began in mid-June 2021. Thus far, Ryanair has 
taken six B737-8-200s and Malta Air another six. The group's Polish unit, Buzz, is due to take its first B737-8-200 
on September 9, 2021. The remaining B737-8-200s will deliver by the end of 2025.
While Ryanair's B737-8-200 seats up to 197 passengers, an increase over the B737-800's maximum capacity of 
189 passengers in a single-class layout, the B737-10 would be able to carry up to 230 passengers.
Ryanair Holdings also operates 417 B737-800s split between Ryanair (251 units), Malta Air (120), Buzz (46), and 
Ryanair UK (two). Ryanair also operates a single B737-700. Lauda Europe is the group's sole Airbus operator with 
twenty-nine A320-200s, the ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows.

Zurich has pledged to slash emissions from air travel, the latest big employer to seize on working practices 
introduced during the pandemic to cut its carbon footprint.
The Swiss company said yesterday that from next year it would cut emissions generated from flights for employees 
to 70 per cent below pre-pandemic levels, one of a number of changes designed to help the group meet an existing 
goal of halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.
Zurich, which employs 55,000 people in more than 200 countries, said it would achieve the target by holding fewer 
internal meetings that involved travel and using video conference tech.
"The experience of the global pandemic has shown us a pathway to improving many aspects of our daily and 
working lives, and there's no going back," chief executive Mario Greco said.
The move comes as airlines anxiously await the return of lucrative business travel.
The pandemic has forced companies to replace face-to-face meetings with digital communication and cut travel 
budgets.
Some airline executives such as Ryanair's
Michael O'Leary are expecting a full recovery while others such as Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, are 
braced for a 20 per cent reduction in coming years.

Lloyds has pledged to keep emissions from travel to under than 50 per cent of 2019 levels, while Dutch bank ABN 
Amro is aiming to halve its air travel compared with 2017. Consultancies Deloitte and PwC, and consumer group 
Nestle, have pledged to reduce travel.
A permanent reduction would be a big blow to hotels and airlines, given that corporate travel can generate up to 75 
per cent of airlines' revenues on some international flights, according to PwC.
