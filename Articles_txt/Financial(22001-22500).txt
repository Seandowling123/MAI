The main Dublin shares index plunged deeper in to the red, hitting the 2,400 mark in the morning and erasing much 
of the gains made earlier this week amid growing concerns over economic growth and European bank funding.
The index fell 34.87 points to 2,419.77.
European shares approached two-year lows, extending the previous session's plunge, on fears that major 
economies are heading for recession and that policymakers have no answer to the euro zone debt crisis. The 
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 2.7 percent at 899.86 points, having gone as low as 
890.74, just above the two-year low of 888.11 hit on Aug. 9. The decline follows a 4.8 percent tumble on Thursday, 
its biggest one-day fall since March 2009, on a raft of gloomy U.S. economic data and concerns over short-term 
funding stress on European banks.
Ryanair announced that it has purchased and cancelled 16,000,000 ordinary shares at an average price of E3.14 
per share. Following the cancellation, Ryanair has 1,463,789,261 shares in issue. "Ryanair has now 
opportunistically cancelled 1.8pc of issued shares since August 4th. As we have indicated before, Ryanair is the 
best placed among the airlines from a financial and operational leverage viewpoint in a consolidating market. Yield 
growth and falling oil prices should provide a potent mix," according to Davy analyst, Stephen Furlong. Shares in 
the airline fell 1c to E3.09. Paddy Power this week announced that it will receive a once-off tax gain of E26m 
(AUD36m) from the Australian Tax Office (ATO). The refund relates to goods and services tax (GST) paid by its 
Australian subsidiaries, Sportsbet and IAS, between October 2005 and October 2009. The Federal Court in 
Australia ruled in favour of Sportsbet's and IAS' interpretation of the relevant GST legislation, and the ATO has 
confirmed that it does not intend to appeal the court's decision. Approximately half of the gain is expected to be 
received as a cash refund later this year and half as a credit against Goods and Services Tax (GST) payable in

future years. The relevant legislation was amended in 2010 so the judgment does not impact future periods. Shares 
in the bookies climbed 34c to E32.86. Blistering temperatures reduced milk output in the US mid west in July and 
resulted in one of the lowest increases in monthly national milk output for some time. But in regions where Glanbia 
has operations, growth was positive. Output in Idaho rose by 4.8pc, the increase composed almost equally by rising 
yield and increased cow numbers. In Texas and New Mexico, regions that supply Glanbia's Southwest Cheese joint 
venture, output rose by 8.3pc and 2.4pc year-on-year respectively. Glanbia's shares remained flat at E3.94. 
Kingspan is due to issue interim results for the six months to June end on Monday. Goodbody Stockbrokers are 
forecasting operating profit (pre-amortisation) of E40m on sales of E709m, representing growth of 11pc and 27pc, 
respectively. Such growth reflects an initial contribution from the acquisition of CRH's insulation business and solid 
organic growth, offset somewhat by lower margins due to higher input costs. Net debt at the end of the period is 
forecast to be E230m, up from E124m at year end, which is a function of the CRH acquisition. Kingspan's shares 
gained 1c to E5.87 while CRH's stocks tumbled 34c to E11.11.

Shares have suffered big new falls in Dublin this morning, as they track a continued tumble on global markets.
The ISEQ indes was 45.13 points down a short time ago at 2,409,51, following on its 111 points fall yesterday.
The downward global trend is being fed by worries that major economies could be headed into recession, and that 
policymakers have no solutions for the euro zone debt crisis.
Most big names are in negative territory in Dublin. CRH is down 43c to 1101, with DCC off by 55c to 1723 and 
Smurfit Kappa has dropped 20c to 470. Aryzta has dived by 103c to 3077, Ryanair has slipped by 5c to 305 and

News In Brief
## A committee representing so-called Pik note loanholders in Eircom has written to the board of its Cayman 
Islands-based parent stating they have every reason to believe the company is insolvent. In the latest twist to the 
Eircom financial saga, they have also questioned how the parent company intends to repay its debt. In addition, the 
committee has accused the directors of being in breach of their duty of care towards them and have warned they 
will take legal or other action if necessary to protect their position. The letter was delivered by hand in the Cayman 
Islands yesterday to ERC Ireland Preferred Equity Ltd, the ultimate parent company of Eircom and the entity that 
issued the loan notes. It states that the directors have a duty of care to creditors ahead of shareholders and that 
they have lost faith in the board's ability to look after their interests. - Irish Times
## A leading Belgian trade union is planning to take legal action against Ryanair for imposing work conditions on 
cabin crew that it alleges violate Belgian law. Tony Demonte of Belgium's CNE workers' union said the suit would 
likely be filed in September and that both Ryanair and its partner Crewlink, which provides a large part of the 
airline's cabin staff, would be targeted. Ryanair has said there is 'no truth' to the claims by CNE. The union 
condemned that fact that workers' paychecks are deducted 30 euros a month for 12 months to pay for uniforms. 
Cabin crew are also transferred without financial compensation and given little notice if fired, CNE claimed. There 
are no company provisions for sick pay, and crew is also blocked from living more than hour away from the airport. 
Ryanair has consistently argued that its employment contracts need only satisfy Irish law. Crewlink is also based in 
Ireland. - RTE
## The boards of two semi-state companies have been warned to sack their chief executives if they refuse to sign 
revised contracts. It follows a dispute with the Department of Agriculture over the chief executives' ability to amass 
annual bonuses and their right to claim backdated awards. It follows a lengthy standoff between his department and 
Roundup:Creditors claim Eircom insolvent; Eircom Accused
the bodies concerned, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon. In the case of HRI, the board reversed chief 
executive Brian Kavanagh's voluntary salary cut of 15,573 euros in 2010 to compensate for his lack of bonuses 
during the economic crisis. It also insisted on paying him 37,550 euros in outstanding bonuses. Meanwhile, Bord na 
gCon's Adrian Neilan has been employed since January 2007 but has never signed a contract. This is because of 
additional clauses added to the standard contract for semi-state bosses. - Irish Examiner ## Ratings agency DBRS 
has downgraded Ireland's debt due to what it says are the country's "weaker than expected" growth prospects. The 
downgrade comes six weeks after the Toronto-based rating agency said it was unlikely to change the State's rating. 
Its most senior sovereign analyst on July 7th said Ireland's "A" rating was unlikely to be changed. Yesterday the 
agency said slower growth in the US and Europe could dampen Ireland's prospects for recovery, given its 
dependence on exports. It downgraded Ireland's long-term foreign and local currency debt to "A (low)" from "A". 
The trend on both types of debt ratings remains negative. DBRS is one of four rating agencies considered by the 
European Central Bank (ECB) in deciding which bonds can be used as collateral in its lending operations. Since the 
agency's rating for Ireland is still higher than that of Moody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch, the Republic will be 
able to avoid an ECB penalty charge when borrowing and using bonds as collateral. - Irish Times ## The debt 
collection firm owned by former criminal Martin "The Viper" Foley is turning a profit, according to its latest accounts. 
Crumlin, Dublin-based Viper Debt Recovery and Repossession Service is a relatively new operator in the market. 
Latest accounts filed for the year to September 30, 2009, show a turnover of 65,509 euros. Operating profit was 
23,680 euros after administrative expenses of 41,829 euros. Shareholders' funds amounted to 23,682 euros in the 
year. The company employed three people in the year. Directors are listed as Martin Foley, Troy Jordan and Sonia 
Doyle. - Irish Examiner ## Transport company Kuehne and Nagel, which is based at Dublin Airport, has grown 
sales by 25pc in its latest year, passing a 6m euro dividend to its Swiss parent, one of the largest logistics firms in 
the world. The Irish operation, which provides a range of services to Irish companies and multinationals, produced a 
pre-tax profit of 4.1m euros, up from 2.9m euros in the previous year. Sales rose to 110m euros from 86.3m euros, 
with the vast majority of the revenues coming via local Irish operations. - Irish Independent ## The unemployment 
rate in Northern Ireland increased to 7.3pc for the period from April to June. The rate remains below the EU 
average of 9.3pc and the Irish rate of 14pc. A rate of 6.7pc was recorded in the same period last year. Almost half 
of those unemployed in Northern Ireland have been jobless for at least 12 months. The unemployment rate for 18 to 
24-year-olds is 17pc. - RTE ## One of the country's leading car dealers that specialised in providing luxury cars at 
the height of the Celtic Tiger boom has gone out of business. The owners of Cunningham Higgins in Galway, which 
specialised in top-of-the-range luxury vehicles such as Bentley, Porche, Maserati, Mercedes Benz and Aston 
Martin, said yesterday they had no choice but to close after the market collapsed. They closed the premises at 
Ballybrit on Monday to carry out a review of the business. Niall Cunningham and Joe Higgins said they were closing 
down after revealing that revenue dropped from 22m euros in 2007 to around 6m euros this year. - Irish 
Independent ## Newspaper group Johnston Press Ireland significantly reduced its losses last year as it continued a 
number of cost-cutting measures. Pre-tax losses amounted to 3.9m euros, compared with a loss of just over 6m 
euros in the previous year, according to the accounts for the year to the end of December last. The accounts reveal 
that there was an exceptional non-recurring item of 5.4m euros, 4.1m euros of which relates to the writedown of 
assets following the closure of the Limerick print press and the cost of the remaining lease on the property. There 
were also redundancy costs of 1.9m euros due to the closure of the print press and a management restructure in 
Ireland. If these expenses had not been incurred, the profit before tax for the period would have amounted to 
E1.5m, compared to a loss before tax of E20,000 in the previous year. Total revenues fell by 24.6pc at Johnston 
Press to 23.1m euros, mostly due to a "continued decline in print advertising revenues". - Irish Examiner

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has offered to buy either of the terminals at Dublin airport for 350m euro.
"I'd buy one of the terminals tomorrow, no problem," he told the Sunday Independent.
"We'd happily buy tyhe old terminal. Or we'd buy the new terminal, but we wouldn't pay 1.2bn euros for it, which is 
what it cost to build.
"You'd probably get 350m euro each for them. "It doesn't matter who buys the remaining one as long as they are 
different owners, so that there isn't a monopoly." While such a sale would leave the taxpayer with big losses, Mr 
O'Leary added that there "will absolutely" be a sale of all semi-state assets because of the nation's indebtedness, 
"starting with the stake in Aer Lingus". He added: "If the airline isn't sold to Ryanair, another buyer will rbeak it up, 
whereas we'll grow passenger numbers to 20m over three or four years and grow the fleet from 30 to 60 aircraft."

Gaybo's comments about Ireland being run by ''mad people in Brussels'' remind us of the timeless British - and 
sometimes Irish - tabloid obsession with attacking ''bumbling Brussels bureaucrats'', generally on the basis of some 
complete and wilful misinterpretation of what they were up to.
Of course the most famous was the alleged attempt to ban bananas that were too, well, bent.
There was just a small germ of truth in this one.
There is an EU directive which says that bananas which claim to be of the highest class must be ''free from 
malformation or abnormal curvature''.
But seeing as nobody seems to have defined what abnormal is, this one never seemed to get very far.
It prompted one of the famous Sun headlines - ''Now they really have gone bananas''.
Among the other gems were a reported move to ban the naming of the popular snack as ''Bombay Mix'', seeing as 
the city in India was subsequently renamed Mumbai.
According to the BBC, this was traced back to a news agency editor who said he had a mate who had heard it from 
a friend of his in the Home Office. It was completely untrue.
Other alleged moves included one by ''po-faced pen pushers'' to stop barmaid's showing too much cleavage (a 
complete over-interpretation of a directive designed to protect employees from over exposure to sun or other 
damaging light), reported moves to ''ban'' corgi dogs, outlaw British and Irish style toilets in favour of ' 'Euro loos'', 
standardise the size of condoms and insist that yoghurt must be made from a Belgian recipe (all completely untrue).
Then we had the yarn that Irish red lemonade was to be banned (it was just one carcinogenic ingredient), that 
donkeys on the beach would have to wear nappies, that the EU was funding the construction of arms dumps for the 
Silly Season
IRA by Irish farmers and outlawing Valentines cards, square gin bottles, soya milk, traditional pizza slices, smokey 
bacon crisps and mushy peas.
And oh yes, workers would have to be consulted by employers on what type of tea bags the company would buy.
And shellfish would have to be given rest breaks in journeys of over 50 kilometres. Ah, you couldn't make it up.
* Pity poor David Cameron.
Having had an austerity summer holiday in Cornwall last year and flown on Ryanair to a Spring break in Spain, he 
faced some criticism for heading to Tuscany this year to what the tabloids delighted in calling a ''luxury villa'' with 
two other families.
The poor Camerons were paying for it all themselves - to the tune of £5,800 - unlike Tony Blair. ''Tuscan Tony'' 
regularly stayed in ''Chiantishire'' as a guest of Italian aristocrat Prince Girolamo Strozzi.
Then, having taken the flak, Cameron was forced to fly back when rioting broke out in London. At least all the MPs 
who had to return from their holidays for the emergency commons debate will have their travel expenses paid.
As if they haven't had enough of a wheeze on the expenses there already.
* A tantalising snippet to emerge from our football survey in this week's paper is that a Spanish bank has effectively 
pledged footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká as collateral for funds it has secured from the European Central 
Bank.
The story, which seems to have surfaced first in the German newspaper, Suddeutsche Zeitung, is that Spain's 
Bankia group of savings banks - which financed Real Madrid's acquisition of Ronaldo - has pledged the two 
footballers in return for getting access to ECB cash.
Well it's probably better than the dodgy collateral they have from some of the Irish banks.
Would you prefer to have your money secured on a field in Longford or Ronaldo's twinkling feet?
* Two entrepreneurial businesses were rewarded for their efforts last week, with the sale of Jacob Fruitfield to Valeo 
Foods, and the acquisition of Data Electronics by Telecity for  100 million. Jacob Fruitfield is a household name, but 
Data Electronics, a Dublin IT firm with a long pedigree, is less well-known.
Over the years, it has invested about  40 million in two highly-advanced data centres, used by firms to store, 
manage and transmit their data.
Telecity, a London-listed firm that already runs 26 data centres, saw it as an attractive target.
''There's a lack of data centres and Ireland is recognised as a great location for them," said one corporate finance 
source last week. ''If only we could figure out a way to turn three-star hotels into data centres," Nama, take note.

Byline: Kevin Brown in Singapore
Body
Tony Fernandes was in typically pugnacious mood on Friday, telling followers of his rambunctious Twitter feed that 
"sales are kick-ass" as he headed for London on AirAsia X, his long-haul budget airline, writes Kevin Brown in 
Singapore .
It was a typically exuberant comment by Mr Fernandes, the British-educated Malaysian entrepreneur whose AirAsia 
group of low-cost carriers is fast becoming an Asian business phenomenon.
As he prepares for second-quarter results next week, though, Mr Fernandes is facing concerns that his latest coup - 
a deal giving him effective control of Malaysian Airline System, the venerable Malaysian flag-carrier - may risk 
stretching his entrepreneurial drive too far for comfort.
Short, rotund and perennially effervescent, Mr Fernandes has emerged over the past decade as one of Asia's 
boldest and most successful entrepreneurs, establishing an empire ranging from airlines to telecoms through his 
privately held Tune Group.
Relentlessly informal - he usually sports a red baseball cap and is never seen in a tie - Mr Fernandes, 47, has 
shaken Asia's state-dominated aviation industry by the throat since buying AirAsia and two old aircraft from the 
Malaysian government through Tune for just M$1 in 2001.
Inspired by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou , founder of the UK budget airline EasyJet, Mr Fernandes also soaked up some 
of the swashbuckling spirit of Sir Richard Branson while working after university as an accountant at Virgin 
Communications.
Like his role models, Mr Fernandes has a keen eye for the brand-building value of publicity - hence the never-
ending stream of Twitter posts, along with more substantial ventures such as his Lotus Formula One racing team 
and attempts to buy West Ham, the English football club.
Fernandes sticks to flight plan
Sir Richard has remained a long-term supporter as Mr Fernandes turned AirAsia - floated on the Kuala Lumpur 
stock market in 2004 - into the region's fastest-growing budget airline. Its 100-plus red and white Airbus A320s are 
garishly visible at airports from New Zealand to China, and India to Japan.
Along the way he has found time to launch budget carriers in Indonesia and Thailand, with a further offshoot due to 
start in Vietnam this year and a Japanese offshoot being planned in a joint venture with All Nippon Airways.
He has also defied industry norms with the launch in 2007 of AirAsia X as an affiliated but separately owned long-
haul budget carrier, and delivered a relentless focus on costs. Analysts say that has made AirAsia even more 
efficient than Southwest Airlines, the US carrier that invented the low-cost model, or Ryanair, its best-known 
European exponent.
However, people with knowledge of the MAS deal say there are concerns within AirAsia over whether Mr 
Fernandes is stretching himself too thin.
The deal, concluded on Tuesday and officially presented as a partnership, gives Tune 20.5 per cent of MAS, two 
board seats and an unofficial veto over top management. In return the government gets two board seats at AirAsia, 
a 10 per cent holding in the airline and a similar stake in unlisted AirAsia X.
The effect is to remove MAS as a competitor in the budget sector, both domestically and internationally. But Mr 
Fernandes also becomes a significant shareholder in MAS, which means he now has interests in five airlines, with 
two more expected to launch in the next year, in addition to an F1 team and the hotel, financial services and 
telecoms interests of Tune Group.
The worry is that all these interests may leave him too little time for the daily focus on cost-control that he has 
identified as the key to long-term success.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it carried nearly half of all of Spain's new passenger growth in July.
It said that its Spanish traffic grew by 800,000 in July (up 25pc), to 3.8 million passengers, which confirms that 
Ryanair alone delivered over half of the 1.4 millkion passenger growth through all Spanish airports in July.
Ryanair's July traffic grew rapidly at Barcelona El Prat (+100pc), Palma (+45pc), Alicante (+14pc), Gran Canaria 
(+74pc), Ibiza (+63pc), Tenerife (+92pc) and Lanzarote (+89pc) Airports, with Ryanair delivering more traffic growth 
at Spanish airports than all the other airlines combined.
While Ryanair's Spanish traffic grew 25pc in July, Iberia/IAG Group's July traffic fell 5pc, it said. . The airline used 
the figures to take another swipe at the Dublin Airport Authority, saying Spanish operator, AENA's 7pc traffic growth 
is in marked contrast to the "meagre" 1pc July growth at the DAA Dublin Airport.

Byline: Kevin Brown
Body
Tony Fernandes, chief executive of AirAsia, is one of the region's boldest and most successful entrepreneurs . But 
is his decision to take a stake in lossmaking Malaysian Airline System another masterstroke, or a disastrous 
mistake? The answer may depend on whether his ego has swamped his business sense.
So far, Mr Fernandes has hardly put a step wrong. As a serial entrepreneur, he has founded no fewer than four 
airlines - AirAsia, its long-haul affiliate Air-Asia X and joint ventures in Indonesia and Thailand. He is also part-
owner, with his business partner, of the privately held Tune Group , which runs hotel, financial services and mobile 
phone businesses.
When he bought AirAsia through Tune for a token M$1 plus M$40m debt in 2001, it was a failing state-owned 
regional carrier with two aircraft. It now has more than 100 aircraft, and has just signed an $18bn deal with Airbus 
for 200 A320s over 15 years - the third-biggest order in the aircraft maker's history.
Investors are in no doubt about Mr Fernandes' Midas touch. The shares have outperformed the global aviation 
index by more than 100 per cent since AirAsia was floated in 2004. No carrier has bettered its average 57 per cent 
annual increase in net income. The stock, up almost a third this year before the latest turmoil, was worth $3.6bn 
before the shares were suspended on Monday. That is more than double the market value of the Malaysian flag-
carrier.
Of course, AirAsia benefits from being in the right place at the right time. Its pace of growth is underpinned by the 
rapid expansion of emerging Asian economies. Average economic growth of about 7 per cent a year is lifting 
millions more people every year to an economic level at which they can afford a budget airline flight.
But Mr Fernandes is not just grabbing chunks of a growing market. AirAsia has grown consistently, as well as fast, 
thanks to a rigorous focus on expenses. Costs per passenger kilometre are lower than both Southwest Airlines of 
the US, which invented the low-cost model, and Ryanair, the Irish group often regarded as the world's most 
competitive carrier.
AirAsia chief hopes for the last laugh with MAS stake
By contrast, state-owned MAS has failed either to adapt to the low-cost era, or to trade effectively as a premium 
carrier, the strategy pursued (albeit with faltering success) by neighbouring Singapore Airlines. MAS has 
restructured twice in the past nine years following financial crises, and is now in trouble again, losing $79m in the 
quarter to March. The second-quarter result, due shortly, is expected to be equally dire.
Angered by the airline's resistance to change and worried by the looming cost of fleet renewal, the government has 
given up, forcing MAS to accept a deal, confirmed on Tuesday, under which Tune will take a 20.5 per cent stake in 
return for a 10 per cent holding in AirAsia. Khazanah Nasional, the sovereign wealth fund that owns MAS, will also 
buy 10 per cent of unlisted AirAsia X.
For Mr Fernandes, this is a moment to savour. Never shy of self-promotion, he has been hurt and offended over the 
years by the Malaysian elite, which regarded him as a comic upstart. They laughed when he started in business 
with two old aircraft and $250,000; they laughed again when he spoke of building AirAsia into the region's most 
successful airline, when he launched a Formula One racing team and tried to buy an English Premiership football 
club.
Their laughter has now ceased. But it would be ironic if Mr Fernandes' moment of recognition turned out to be a 
millstone round his neck. This is not an inconsiderable risk. The deal was officially characterised as a partnership, 
but would be better seen as a last-chance rescue. Both earlier restructurings of MAS failed to resolve its underlying 
problems, and Azman Mokhtar, the head of Khazanah, has spent years putting it through a reform programme , to 
little effect.
The government hopes the freewheeling Mr Fernandes will provide the missing ingredient. Perhaps he will. But 
focusing on the fading flag-carrier would surely divert inordinate amounts of time from running AirAsia and its 
offshoots.
With Singapore rival Tiger Airways in trouble - suspended from flying in Australia on safety grounds, and bleeding 
S$2m a week - this is no time for Mr Fernandes to take his eye off the ball.
The signals are that he will not. Indeed, the obvious gains will accrue to AirAsia: route rationalisation is likely to 
favour the lower-cost operator, and the deal should reboot government thinking on awarding new routes.
Mr Fernandes will aim to push MAS upmarket, and try to close Firefly, the flag-carrier's largely domestic budget 
offshoot, leaving AirAsia with a local monopoly. If he can help MAS recover, he will. But not at AirAsia's expense. 
Recognition is sweet. But victory is sweeter.

The main Dublin shares market plunged 4.4pc today to its lowest level since April of 2009, wiping nearly E4.5 billion 
off the value of shares and erasing much of the gains made since the collapse of Lehman Brother in November 
2008.
The ISEQ tumbled 110.75 points to 2,395.73.
The fallout from Standard and Poor's downgrade of the United States pushed world stocks to their lowest level in 
nearly a year on Monday and drove investors into the safety of gold and bonds. Strange as it may be, investors 
sought shelter in the asset that was downgraded - choosing U.S. government bonds because of their liquidity and 
perception of the high quality of U.S. credit. Investors shunned stocks and commodities, struggling to discern the 
effects of the downgrade, which could hit various components of the financial sector, from mortgage lenders to

The ISEQ this morning slumped to its lowest level in almost two and a half years, erasing much of the gains made 
since the collapse of Lehman Brother in November 2008.
By 12:30, the index had fallen by 59.29 points to 2,447.19.
Deep-rooted jitters about the U.S. debt rating cut sent world stocks towards 11-month low today, overshadowing 
relief that the European Central Bank was buying bonds of euro zone strugglers Italy and Spain. Having seen some 
dollar 2.5 trillion wiped off its global share values last week, MSCI's all-country world stock index was down a 
further one percent.
Wall Street looked set to add to the rout with S and P 500 futures down around 2.5pc. European share measured 
by the FTSEurofirst 300 index were down 2pc after earlier registering gains on the ECB action, intended to take the 
heat out of the spreading euro zone debt crisis. Yields on five-year Italian and Spanish bonds fell around a full 
percentage point, spreads against German debt narrowed and the cost of insuring them against default dropped. 
But safe-haven buying sent gold soaring to a new record above dollar 1,700 an ounce and the dollar weakened 
against a basket of major currencies. Investors were seemingly unimpressed by weekend talks between 
industrialised countries aimed at safeguarding the smooth functioning of financial markets following agency S and 
P's cut in its U.S. rating late on Friday to AA-plus from AAA. "It won't be long now before other ratings agencies 
follow suit, considering the state of the U.S.' finances. One thing is for certain, and that's that volatility will continue 
to remain high, making trading conditions difficult," said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads. 
Moody's repeated a warning today it could downgrade the United States before 2013 if the fiscal or economic 
outlook weakened significantly, but said it saw the potential for a new deal in Washington to cut the budget deficit 
before then.

The ISEQ has fallen to its lowest level since April 2009, as the crisis in the eurozone deepens.
By 12.30 the ISEQ had fallen 33.84 points to 2511.67.
World stocks sank for an eighth straight session today, wiping USD2.5 trillion off their value on the week, as 
concern ballooned over the slowing global economy and the spread of debt anguish into Italy and Spain.
Wall Street also looked set to open lower, contingent on what is in the latest U.S. jobs report due for release 
beforehand. There was widespread demand for policymakers to beef up plans to tackle the euro zone's crisis and 
prevent the U.S. economy in particular from sliding back into recession. One investment firm called for a "shock and 
awe" approach in Europe, a reference to the U.S.-led aerial assault on Iraq. Global equities were down 1.5 pc on 
the day for a roughly 8.5 pc loss this week. Emerging market shares stumbled 3.2 pc on the day. The pan-
European FTSEurofirst 300 fell around 1.9 pc. Gold jumped more than 1 pc and the oil and metals markets 
slumped with investors seeking safe havens and reacting to the prospect of a slower global economic growth. 
Shares in Bank of Ireland this morning fell below the price at which the government had underwritten a rights issue 
and the level US and Canadian investors had committed to buy a E1.1bn stake. Shares in Bank of Ireland were 
down 1 cent to E0.09 in line with a tumble in ISEQ share prices and a rout on world stock markets. Late last month, 
the government underwrote a E1.91 billion rights issue at 10 cents a share for existing Bank of Ireland 
shareholders. Shares in Paddy Power fell 70 cent to E31.30, as UK competitor William Hill released first half results 
that are ahead of Davy's forecast. "EBITA for H1 came in at STG147.7m (Davy: STG145.0m, consensus 
STG141m). The outlook statement suggests that the group remains very comfortable with prospects for the

million of its shares yesterday. "Ryanair announced that on August 4th 2011 it purchased 7,000,000 ordinary

CRH saw shares rise 26 cent to E12.40. "After the market closed yesterday Vicat (a French based building

The ISEQ has fallen to its lowest level since April 2009, as the crisis in the eurozone deepens.
By 12.30 the ISEQ had fallen 33.84 points to 2511.67.
World stocks sank for an eighth straight session today, wiping USD2.5 trillion off their value on the week, as 
concern ballooned over the slowing global economy and the spread of debt anguish into Italy and Spain.
Wall Street also looked set to open lower, contingent on what is in the latest U.S. jobs report due for release 
beforehand. There was widespread demand for policymakers to beef up plans to tackle the euro zone's crisis and 
prevent the U.S. economy in particular from sliding back into recession. One investment firm called for a "shock and 
awe" approach in Europe, a reference to the U.S.-led aerial assault on Iraq. Global equities were down 1.5 pc on 
the day for a roughly 8.5 pc loss this week. Emerging market shares stumbled 3.2 pc on the day. The pan-
European FTSEurofirst 300 fell around 1.9 pc. Gold jumped more than 1 pc and the oil and metals markets 
slumped with investors seeking safe havens and reacting to the prospect of a slower global economic growth. 
Shares in Bank of Ireland this morning fell below the price at which the government had underwritten a rights issue 
and the level US and Canadian investors had committed to buy a E1.1bn stake. Shares in Bank of Ireland were 
down 1 cent to E0.09 in line with a tumble in ISEQ share prices and a rout on world stock markets. Late last month, 
the government underwrote a E1.91 billion rights issue at 10 cents a share for existing Bank of Ireland 
shareholders. Shares in Paddy Power fell 70 cent to E31.30, as UK competitor William Hill released first half results 
that are ahead of Davy's forecast. "EBITA for H1 came in at STG147.7m (Davy: STG145.0m, consensus 
STG141m). The outlook statement suggests that the group remains very comfortable with prospects for the 
remainder of the year", according to the stockbroker. Shares in Ryanair rose 1 cent to E3.06 after it cancelled 7 
million of its shares yesterday. "Ryanair announced that on August 4th 2011 it purchased 7,000,000 ordinary 
shares for cancellation. The price paid for these ordinary shares was E3.07 per share. Following the cancellation of 
these shares, the company will have 1,483,789,261 ordinary shares in issue," said Davy. Ireland's biggest company 
ISEQ tumbles to lowest since April 09 ISEQ falls
CRH saw shares rise 26 cent to E12.40. "After the market closed yesterday Vicat (a French based building 
materials company) reported first half EBITDA of E253m, which was slightly behind consensus of E261m. Similar to 
other heavyside building materials companies, the results show more normalised growth in the second quarter (H1

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has branded government claims about rising tourist numbers as "bogus" in an 
escalating war of words with transport minister Leo Varadkar.
The row follows a decision by Mr Varadkar to keep the 3 euro travel tax in place until after the winter at least.
The decision was because of a lack of solid commitments from airlines on new routes, the minister said.
Ryanair had offered to bring in five million extra passengers a year across the country's three main airports, but 
wanted landing and passenger charges for those additional passengers abolished for five years. Mr Varadkar said, 
however, that the offers by Ryanair and others included outward bound holiday flights. He said he would only 
abolish the tax if airlines delivered a "meaningful response" for boosting visitors to Ireland. Ryanair has now turned 
the argument on its head by claiming that passenger numbers are falling and government action is needed to stem 
this fall. Mr O'Leary rejected figures from the Central Statistics Office in May which showed an almost 9pc increase 
in overseas visitors to the Republic in the first quarter of the year. It added that visitor numbers from North America 
were 11.9pc higher and from Britain 7.2pc higher. Mr O'Leary claimed the rises were virtually impossible. He 
maintained that airline seat capacity to Ireland fell 6pc from Britain in the first quarter, by 15pc from mainland 
Europe and by 1pc from North America. "The CSO is producing completely bogus visitor statistics based on a tiny 
survey that shows that visitor statistics are actually rising while traffic at the Irish airports in all segments is 
continuing to decline," he said.

BRITISH Airways parent company IAG yesterday reported a 3.5 per cent jump in traffic for July.
The figure, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, grew to 16.1bn. However, the actual number of passengers 
decreased 2.7 per cent to 5m. IAG, which was formed by the merger between Spanish carrier Iberia and BA, was 
boosted by a 10 per cent growth in passengers in Latin America and the Caribbean and a nine per cent rise in Asia.
Traffic in the UK and Spain, however, dropped more than 20 per cent. British Airways traffic rose by 6.2 per cent 
overall, with Iberia's falling by more than two per cent.
Premium traffic grew at a faster rate than economy traffic and the company also saw its passenger load factor - the 
number of full seats per plane - inch up by 0.6 percentage points to 85.7 per cent.
IAG saw its shares fall by more than four per cent yesterday.
Meanwhile, Europe's largest lowcost airline Ryanair saw passenger numbers increase to 8.1m in July, a six per 
cent increase from a year ago.
Ryanair said its load factor - a measure of how well a carrier is selling available seats - was 89 per cent for the 
month, up one percentage point from July 2010.

Dublin shares have clawed back most of a 1.5pc dive they suffered early on this morning.
Shortly after the opening, the ISEQ index had shed 41.60 points to stand at just 2,668.26.
The fall mirrored big drops on US and Asian markets on investor concern about worsening global economic 
prospects and a perceived shortfall in the US deficit bill to deal with it.
A short time ago the ISEQ index had recovered to a dip of just 16.45 points to 2,693.91 for the session. Key losers 
this morning are Elan, down 27c to 775, Smurfit Kappa off by 24c to 615 and Ryanair 3c lower to 305. Bucking the 
trend are CRH, up 5c to 1270 and DCC, head by 4c to 1799.

Ryanair today said it has become the first ever European airline to carry 8 million passengers in a single month.
Last month, the no-frills airline said it carried 8.1 million travellers - a 6pc increase on the same month last year.
It carried 75.9 million passengers in the 12 months to the end of July last, it added.
The airline's load factor for July - an industry standard measure of how well and airline fills its aircraft - rose by 1pc 
last month compared to July of last year to 89pc and its load factor for the 12 months to the end of July was 83pc. 
"Ryanair's record 8m July traffic means Ryanair has carried more passengers in the month of July than Aer Lingus 
will carry on its short-haul network in all of 2011. Ryanair has become the first European airline to carry a record 8m 
passengers in one calendar month. While Ryanair grows sadly Irish airtraffic and tourism continues to decline 
because of the Govt's travel tax and the DAA's high airport fees," the airline's Stephen McNamara said.

Sceptical budget carrier lauds Chinese jet but will hear US airframer's re-engined 737 case
Ryanair is to meet with Boeing to discuss its proposed re-engined 737 as it prepares to send a delegations to China 
around October-November to assess the feasibility of developing the Comac C919 as a 200-seat twinjet. Chief 
executive Michael O'Leary, who will also travel to China, has expressed disappointment over the re-engining, but 
not ruled the US airframer out of talks.
"I'm not a great fan of re-engining," he said. "I think they should have redesigned the aircraft, made it bigger and 
[moved] a step-change ahead of Airbus.
"It strikes us that they're running somewhat [behind] the Airbus [A320neo] at the moment. But they can always 
catch up, and the best way to catch up would be to drop the price of the aircraft. And we'd be very happy to work 
with them if that's what they have in mind." O'Leary said Boeing had promised to update the carrier on the timetable 
and benefits of a re-engined jet but he said he was "extraordinarily impressed" with Comac, which signed a co-
operation agreement with the carrier. "In a series of four meetings they've responded very quickly and favourably to 
every request we've made of them," O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair wants to "advance our discussions" on a 
possible 200-seat version of the C919. "There's been some kind of concerns about all Chinese aircraft but this is a 
glorified Airbus sub-assembled in China."
"It has Western engines, Rockwell avionics, and the Chinese have assembled almost everything else that the West 
consumes at the moment, so I don't have any issue with the aircraft," he added.

million. Looking ahead into fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to be around $155 million to $175 million, 
mainly due to a softening of OSAT demand, while Street predicts $211.22 million. On a full year basis, this would 
represent revenue growth of around 6 percent to 8 percent for fiscal 2011 from last year.

Ireland's reputation as a respected place to do business has taken a battering in recent years.
Even before the property crash and banking crisis, there were question marks over how people were appointed to 
the boards of state bodies and other senior positions in political and business life.
In politics, there seemed to be a tradition of rewarding the hard work of election staff - or simply friends - with 
positions on state boards.
It seems clear that these didn't always reflect the Standards in Public Office Commission's rule which states that 
''state appointments should be made on the basis of merit, taking into account the skills, qualifications and 
experience of the person to be appointed''.
This is an internationally recognisable standard, but there were damaging indications that cronyism permeated 
political and business life in Ireland. US companies in particular, which have high corporate governance standards 
to meet, would not have been impressed by any suggestion of low standards and cronyism in Ireland.
Outside of politics, the past few years exposed a history of non-executive directors to banks and property 
companies that failed to take an independent line against company management.
The Nyberg report on the banking crisis said that there was ''a collegiate and consensual style'' at board level in the 
banks, with very little serious challenge or debate.
Nyberg concluded that nonexecutive directors did not appear to have the banking knowledge and expertise 
necessary to assess the lending and funding risks inherent in their bank business models.
Though formally independent, they were in practice highly reliant on the knowledge, openness and ability of bank 
management.
Comment
The property collapse also showed that the 'independent' non-executive directors of property firms were far from 
independent as regards to risk assessment. In many cases, they merely went along with the dominant 
shareholder's view.
One wonders how many non-executive directors of property development companies accurately and critically 
weighed up the commercial argument for the investments they were getting involved in.
It is now up to Ireland's senior business leaders to promote higher standards of corporate governance, and to move 
the best people into key positions to achieve these higher goals.
Ireland's commercial companies, the majority of which already operate to best practice, need to take the new 
standards imposed on the financial sector and embrace them.
Why not review the performance of each board director every year and document the findings? Wouldn't 
appropriate training for non-executive directors pay for itself in sounder decision-making?
This could only enhance the already solid performance of Ireland's multinational companies such as Glanbia, 
Ryanair and CRH.
We also need to reform and improve corporate governance standards by broadening the 'gene pool' of Irish 
corporate life. It is clear that appointing directors who are known to the existing management tends to result in 
people of similar backgrounds making similar decisions.
We need to be much more sensitive about potential for conflicts of interest, and this may well lead to widening the 
search for non-executive directors outside these shores.
We also need to limit the number of directorships that any individual can hold to a maximum of eight - or five in the 
case of larger companies - as is the case with credit institutions.
This, in turn, will force an expansion of the gene pool outside the same old faces. If we have to look further afield for 
new corporate blood, then so be it.
In particular, Irish companies need to appoint chairmen and chairwomen with clear ability and vision to drive their 
businesses forward and adopt an 'independent from management' viewpoint.
Regulators need to be vigilant and to champion the public interest and not become apologists for their sector or 
their colleagues.
While the confidence of some Irish managers may have been dented by events in recent years, the foundations that 
produced such remarkable growth in the past and made Irish managers such a success abroad are still in place.
Politicians have a crucial role to play in setting new standards.
They need to resist the demands of their political supporters for a position on a state board or quango, and instead 
appoint those with clear ability and experience to the roles.
And they need to support those who have the courage to challenge the status quo.
If they can do that, they can start to reverse the decline in Ireland's international reputation which has been 
seriously tarnished over the past decade.

Ryanair loses Aer Lingus case Ryanair was yesterday dealt a blow by the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which ruled 
that the budget airline's stake in Aer Lingus can be probed by UK watchdogs. Ryanair, the biggest shareholder in 
Aer Lingus, has previously had two hostile bids for the firm blocked under monopoly law. Ryanair said it plans to 
appeal, after arguing the Office of Fair Trading was out of time to launch a probe. Aer Lingus said it welcomed the 
ruling and called on the OFT "to recommence its investigation as soon as possible… Ryanair's shareholding is 
contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of our shareholders and must now be addressed once and 
for all".

Highlight: Ryanair this morning said it would appeal a decision by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in

Ryanair this morning said it would appeal a decision by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in favour of the 
UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over the OFT's decision to investigate its purchase of a 30pc stake in rival Irish 
airline, Aer Lingus.
Ryanair said it would immediately appeal CAT's ruling the OFT was not "out of time" when it attempted in Sept' 10 
to open an investigation into Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority, non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus.
The ruling may allow OFT to investigate the purchase of the stake five years after the event.
Ryanair believes that the OFT could and should have decided whether or not to investigate this acquisition within 
four months of the European Commission's decision (dated 27th June 2007) to prohibit Ryanair's 2006 takeover 
offer for Aer Lingus. "Ryanair's 2006 offer for Aer Lingus was immediately withdrawn. If, as the CAT has ruled 
today, the OFT is not out of time, then this throws the entire body of UK merger and acquisition rules into disarray. 
In M&A transactions, buyers frequently acquire minority stakes in the targets before launching an offer. On the 
basis of the CAT's ruling, the status of such minority stakes will be subject to the uncertainty that the OFT may 
investigate only after all possible appeals to EU Courts have been completed. In many cases this can take between 
5 to 9 years from the date of the original offer, and would mean that companies run the risk of their minority 
holdings being challenged by the OFT up to 9 years after they were first acquired. Ryanair believes that this is 
bureaucratic and regulatory nonsense," a statement from Ryanair said. "We are disappointed with today's CAT 
ruling, which throws UK merger control regulation into disarray. Now instead of the certainty that the OFT must act 
within four months of a European Commission decision, it appears that the OFT can wait for up to 9 years after 
such decision to decide whether to investigate the acquisition of a minority stake. This is clearly ludicrous, and 
means that the OFT can delay a challenge to a minority, non-controlling stake more than 9 years after the original 
Ryanair appeal UK's OFT Aer Lingus rule Ryanair Case
purchase. Ryanair believes that the OFT is clearly "out of time" in this purported investigation of Ryanair's minority 
holding in Aer Lingus. We have instructed our lawyers to immediately appeal this illogical ruling by the CAT, and we 
look forward to this ruling being overturned on appeal by the Court of Appeal," the airline's Stephen McNamara 
said.

The ISEQ plunged lower today amid growing concerns about an imminent U.S. debt default and ahead of the 
results of a crucial Italian bond sale that could potentially drag the eurozone in to a fresh crisis.
The index fell 27.23 points to 2,825.17.
Mounting concerns about a U.S. debt default dragged global stocks down to their lowest in more than a week and 
drove the dollar to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc today. European stocks fell for the fourth 
straight session, following their Asian counterparts, as sovereign debt risks weighed on sentiment and drove 
investors away from riskier assets to safer ones such as gold. Italy's borrowing costs are expected to soar today 
when it sells up to 8.5 billion euros of bonds, with jitters about its debt mountain seen pushing its benchmark 10-
year bond yield to the highest in 11 years. A sell-off in Italian assets earlier this month on fears that the euro zone's 
third-biggest economy was being dragged into the debt crisis eased somewhat after last week's agreement on a 
second bailout package for Greece.
Ryanair said it would appeal a decision by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in favour of the UK's Office of 
Fair Trading (OFT) over the OFT's decision to investigate its purchase of a 30pc stake in rival Irish airline, Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair said it would immediately appeal CAT's ruling the OFT was not "out of time" when it attempted in 
Sept' 10 to open an investigation into Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority, non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. 
Shares in Ryanair fell 9c to E3.19 and Aer Lingus was down 1c to E0.69. Lafarge has reported second quarter core 
profits (EBITDA) of E971m, which is down 14pc year on year and 8pc behind Bloomberg consensus of E1,054m. 
With the sales line slightly ahead, the variance is higher costs, which similar to Cemex highlights the greater cost 
pressures facing the cement companies. From a CRH perspective the main points of note are that the US had a 
poor quarter - Cement volumes were down 5pc in Q2, following +6pc in Q1, reflecting poor weather and a 
challenging construction environment and that European volumes are normalising after strong Q1 - Volumes in

Western Europe were broadly flat in the first half. CRH shares dropped 11c to E13.64. Sportsbet, Paddy Power's 
wholly-owned Australian business, has successfully re-launched its Sportsbet and IASbet sites using OpenBet's 
market-leading sportsbook software. According to Openbet, the transition went smoothly. OpenBet is the 
technology provider behind Paddy Power's very successful online sportsbook in the UK and Ireland. Sportsbet will 
now have access to all the standard platform benefits of the OpenBet platform including a centralised account 
giving a single view of every customer and their betting activity across multiple channels, including mobile. This', 
according to Davy, will enable Sportsbet to manage liabilities and tailor promotions and marketing more effectively. 
Other features include the integration of LiveOdds which will allow customers to enjoy live betting via Sportsbet's 
call centre (in-running betting is not currently permitted online in Australia but is allowed over the phone). Paddy 
Power shares rose 10c to E34.80.

Ryanair this morning said it would appeal a decision by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in favour of the 
UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over the OFT's decision to investigate its purchase of a 30pc stake in rival Irish 
airline, Aer Lingus.
Ryanair said it would immediately appeal CAT's ruling the OFT was not "out of time" when it attempted in Sept' 10 
to open an investigation into Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority, non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus.
The ruling may allow OFT to investigate the purchase of the stake five years after the event.
Ryanair believes that the OFT could and should have decided whether or not to investigate this acquisition within 
four months of the European Commission's decision (dated 27th June 2007) to prohibit Ryanair's 2006 takeover 
offer for Aer Lingus. "Ryanair's 2006 offer for Aer Lingus was immediately withdrawn. If, as the CAT has ruled

The ISEQ plunged lower today amid growing concerns about an imminent U.S. debt default and ahead of the 
results of a crucial Italian bond sale that could potentially drag the eurozone in to a fresh crisis.
The index fell 27.23 points to 2,825.17.
Mounting concerns about a U.S. debt default dragged global stocks down to their lowest in more than a week and 
drove the dollar to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc today. European stocks fell for the fourth 
straight session, following their Asian counterparts, as sovereign debt risks weighed on sentiment and drove 
investors away from riskier assets to safer ones such as gold. Italy's borrowing costs are expected to soar today 
when it sells up to 8.5 billion euros of bonds, with jitters about its debt mountain seen pushing its benchmark 10-
year bond yield to the highest in 11 years. A sell-off in Italian assets earlier this month on fears that the euro zone's 
third-biggest economy was being dragged into the debt crisis eased somewhat after last week's agreement on a 
second bailout package for Greece.
Ryanair said it would appeal a decision by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in favour of the UK's Office of 
Fair Trading (OFT) over the OFT's decision to investigate its purchase of a 30pc stake in rival Irish airline, Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair said it would immediately appeal CAT's ruling the OFT was not "out of time" when it attempted in 
Sept' 10 to open an investigation into Ryanair's 2006 acquisition of a minority, non-controlling stake in Aer Lingus. 
Shares in Ryanair fell 9c to E3.19 and Aer Lingus was down 1c to E0.69. Lafarge has reported second quarter core 
profits (EBITDA) of E971m, which is down 14pc year on year and 8pc behind Bloomberg consensus of E1,054m. 
With the sales line slightly ahead, the variance is higher costs, which similar to Cemex highlights the greater cost 
pressures facing the cement companies. From a CRH perspective the main points of note are that the US had a

to overcharge airlines at Stansted airport.
The move comes days after Britain's largest airport owner was told by the Competition Commission that it must 
begin selling off Stansted and one of its Scottish hubs. Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, suggested Ryanair 
had raised its complaints to push through a sale at a lower price that would force a new operator to impose cheaper 
landing charges.
"Ryanair is a great customer of ours and we work hard to stay in agreement with them. But they have a clear 
interest in a sale. The lower the price, the better the chance that they will pay lower charges."
Mr Matthews indicated that he might seek a judicial review ahead of the September 13 deadline. The sale has been 
delayed before and a judicial review could stall the process until at least 2012.
Ryanair , which accounts for 70 per cent of the traffic at Stansted, said that it had instructed lawyers to file a 
complaint against BAA with the Civil Aviation Authority and Competition Commission.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, accused BAA of "screwing airlines" by raising prices from EUR3.30 to EUR6.60 a 
passenger over the past five years despite a 24 per cent fall in traffic over the period. Airlines including Ryanair and 
Air Berlin were being forced to cut routes and services as a result, he said.
"Any company that has suffered a 30 per cent decline in business over the past five years would respond by cutting 
its prices. Instead, BAA Stansted monopoly's response has been to double its passenger charges, making Stansted 
airport uncompetitive, but generating monopoly profits for the BAA."
Ryanair files BAA grievances
Ryanair's complaint came as BAA reported a narrowing of pre-tax losses from £167.4 in the first six months of 2010 
to £116.9m in the same period this year.
Passenger numbers at its airports grew 7.1 per cent to 41.4m, although the figures were flattered by the 
comparison with April 2010, when thousands of flights were grounded by the Icelandic ash cloud.

BAA, the owner of Stansted and Heathrow, reported smaller losses for the first half of the year, boosted by more 
passengers using its airports.
The airport operator made a pre-tax loss of £249m in the six months to June, down from £279.7m for the same time 
last year.
Traffic across its London airports increased by 7.1 per cent to 41.4m compared with the same period last year when 
flights were disrupted by volcanic ash and British Airways strikes. Heathrow saw its highest number of passengers 
in one quarter, spurred by the launch of American Airlines' and BA' joint transatlantic flights and increasing travel 
demand from emerging economies.
Colin Matthews, BAA's chief executive, said they were still plans to challenge the order for the group to sell two of 
its airports.
Ryanair, who has spoken out in favour of the break up, filed a complaint yesterday with the Civil Aviation Authority 
and the Competition Commission, accusing BAA of overcharging airlines and demanding that they revise the 
current price cap.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said he doesn't care whether the government takes up an offer by his airline to 
fly more passengers into Ireland.
He says he doesn't want to be flying a lot of people at bucket shop fares while oil prices remain high.
"Really, I wouldn't be disappointed if the Irish government doesn't take up our offer or can't reach a decision 
quickly," he said.
"Frankly, with oil at USD 110 or USD 115 a barrel I don't want to be flying a lot of passengers around even at the 
Irish airports at very low fares in winter." His comments followed the release yesterday of figures which showed a 
rise of just 1pc in Ryanair profits for its first quarter to 139m euros. The flatline performance came despite a 29pc 
surge in revenue to 1.15bn euros. Transport minister Leo Varadkar has pledged to scrap the remaining 3 euro 
travel tax if airlines, mainly primarily Ryanair and Aer Lingus - agree to boost traffic by opening new routes from 
Irish airports or expand existing ones. Ryanair has offered to fly an additional five million passengers into Ireland 
over the next five years, but only if the travel tax is eliminated and landing charges are cut massively. It has said 
that if the plan is approved it would probably see Ryanair use about 10 of the aircraft it would have otherwise 
grounded to launch additional routes and flights. Ryanair currently plans to ground about 80 of its nearly 300-strong 
aircraft fleet this winter to save money. Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said yesterday that his department and 
external advisers were still looking at plans by a number of airlines. "I will, following full consideration of the 
discussions with the airlines and consultation with my cabinet colleagues, decide shortly on how best to proceed," 
he added. Separately, it has emerged that Ryanair paid O'Leary 1.1m euros last year. The figure has been revealed 
in its annual report and 20-F statement, which is lodged with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 
United States. It was almost 200,000 euros more than Mr O'Leary received in the previous year and reflected a 
steep increase in his bonus payment for the period. Mr O'Leary was paid a salary of 595,000 euros for the 12

months ended March 31st, 2011, unchanged on the previous year. His bonus amounted to 440,000 euros, up from 
241,000 euros in the previous year. Pension payments brought Mr O'Leary total remuneration to 1.1m euros last 
year.

The main Dublin shares index sank further in to negative territory today with the US debt ceiling stand-off keeping 
equity buyers at bay.
The dollar fell across the board on today after U.S. President Barack Obama gave no sign of a swift breakthrough in 
deadlocked talks to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, while stocks put in mixed performance with focus on earnings.
Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the USD14.3 trillion ceiling by Aug. 2, the United States faces a technical 
default on some of its USD9.6 trillion government bonds outstanding. In a televised address, Obama warned that 
this would be a "reckless and irresponsible outcome," but he gave no indication that a compromise was imminent. 
However, investors so far appear to have done little to prepare for a default or a cut in the triple-A credit rating.
Back home, shares in Kerry Group fell 21c to E29.04, Aryzta dropped 11c to E37.27 and Greencore gained 1c to 
E0.99. Cranswick, a leading chilled food supplier in the UK, has lowered its full-year outlook following a difficult first 
quarter. "It is no surprise that Cranswick describes the UK market as challenging. Given the volatility that persists in 
commodity markets, higher input costs are likely to remain a feature of this sector over the coming quarters," 
according to Davy Stockbrokers. Masco, the US manufacturer and installer of building products, announced Q2 
results after close of business on July 25th. Second quarter revenues were down 1pc year-on-year (yoy) to 
USD2bn, but fractionally ahead of the USD1.98bn expected. North American revenues fell 6pc while international 
revenues rose 18pc, or by 5pc on a constant currency basis. In its outlook comments, Masco, which previously had 
expected growth in H2, now suggests that "growth in the second half of 2011 will be challenged". Shares in CRH - 
one of the biggest construction materials in the US saw its shares fall 18c to E14.13. Ryanair reported first quarterr 
net income of E139.3m yesterday and while behind Goodbody's E147m expectation, it was in line with the E140m 
consensus. "We have made reasonably minor revisions to our current year (2012) estimates, paring our net income 
figure by E9m to E427m (about 2pc). Generally speaking, we have cut our ancillaries figure, are a little better on

non-fuel costs, whilst we now move to USD118 on un-hedged fuel (10pc un-hedged) from USD110 when we last 
struck our forecasts," said analyst Eamonn Hughes. Shares in the Irish no-frills airline gained 2c to E3.42. Bank of 
Ireland shares have - as yet to gain from news that a group of private equity investors are buying a E1 billion-plus 
stake. The stock was unmoved at E0.11. "News of further private investment in Bank of Ireland is a positive 
development for the country on a number of fronts. Firstly, it ensures that the entire banking system will not be 
under public ownership following the impending wave of recapitalisations. Secondly, evidence of private capital 
coming into the country without the need for government guarantees is a vote of confidence in Ireland overall. For 
the banking sector, Bank of Ireland is the first to achieve this since the height of the crisis back in 2008," said

* Yorkshire Building Society has bought the last remaining mortgage and savings customers of Egg from Citigroup.
* ING is to sell its insurance operations in Latin America for 2.68 billion to Colombia's Grupo de Inversiones 
Suramericana, the Dutch bancassurer said on Monday.
* The proposed high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham could earn the government between £6 billion 
and £7 billion if the infrastructure was sold off under a 30-year concession.
* Clorox, the US household products group being stalked by Carl Icahn, is unlikely to receive a rival offer from 
Kimberly-Clark, after that company dismissed talk of a bid.
* Saint-Gobain, the French building materials group, is to buy Wolseley's UK trade business Build Center.
* Ryanair has scaled back its expansion plans in the face of high fuel prices and expects a wave of deal-making as 
weak airlines seek wealthy backers; International Airlines Group, formed of the 2010 merger of BA and Iberia, is 
rumoured to be interested in TAP, the Portuguese Airline, while Lufthansa has been tipped to purchase SAS, the 
Scandinavian carrier.
* Property company MEPC has been lined up for a partial sale or return to the public market among options to help 
develop the business following a long-term refinancing of £470 million of securitised debt this month.
* Shares in Holidaybreak climbed 15% on Monday after the organiser of school trips and weekend get-aways said it 
was in talks that could lead to a takeover.
* Clorox, the US household products group being stalked by Carl Icahn, is unlikely to receive a rival offer from

Tuesday Papers: Yorkshire acquires last of Egg's customers - tips, comment and bids
* Dow/Sadara: feel good factor - heady financial projections some $500 million in equity earnings annually to each 
partner over a decade are made possible by leverage and by cheap raw materials.
* Greek rollover: a default delayed - rather than deal with the problem head-on, the eurozone may unwittingly be 
setting the scene for a bigger default further down the line.
* Reckitt Benckiser: robust results - the company still has wind in its sails, but investors should not be surprised if 
the full-year results come up short.
* ING: disposal is not a bad deal - it's no fun being a forced seller. But Dutch bancassurance group ING makes the 
best of a tough mandate.
* The Japanese Yen: waiting for relief - unintended and unhelpful beneficiary of the macro doubts surrounding the 
US and the eurozone.
Lombard
* Endgame for Egg sums up internet banking saga - chances must be that the hard-boiled types in the Yorkshire 
will not keep the Egg brand forever, incorporating what was once the UK's largest online bank into their own 
offering.
The Times
* ZF Friedrichshafen has bought the world's largest wind turbine gearbox maker, paying £445 million in cash for 
Hansen Transmissions.
Tempus share tips
* Hopld Reckitt Benckiser; any further upside could be limited for Aberdeen Asset Management.
Comment
* Breaking up is hard for BP to do for now.
* News that outside investors will sink 1.1 billion into Bank of Ireland is not only a vote of confidence in the country 
but will also save the Irish Government the embarrassment of full nationalisation.
* The great mystery during negotiations over the US debt ceiling is why markets have been so sanguine.

News analysis
The airline predicts a spate of mergers in the sector, write Gill Plimmer and Mark Wembridge 
Body
Ryanair has scaled down its expansion plans in the face of high fuel prices and expects a wave of dealmaking as 
weak airlines seek wealthy backers.
With airlines facing a $100 a barrel oil price, Ryanair said there would be a period of consolidation in the industry 
that would see just four large airline groups dominating the continental market in a few years' time.
Fuel cost Ryanair EUR140m (£124m) more in the three months to June than in the same period a year ago, a 50 
per cent increase.
International Airlines Group, formed by the 2010 merger of BA and Iberia, is rumoured to be interested in the 
Portuguese Airline TAP, recently bailed out by its cash-strapped government, while Lufthansa has been tipped to 
purchase the Scandinavian airline SAS.
"Once we get over $100 a barrel, it's a tipping point. We expect the consolidation process to continue and capacity 
to come out of the airline industry," said Howard Millar, chief financial officer at Ryanair. "We believe we are into an 
era of high oil prices. Nobody believes we will see $20 or $30 a barrel again."
Ryanair's shares slipped 8 cents to close at EUR3.40 as it admitted that "stubbornly high" fuel costs had squeezed 
its own profit growth and it expects passenger numbers to fall this winter for the first time in its history.
The company missed analysts' forecasts of EUR151m, with net profit up 1 per cent to EUR139.3m in the three 
months to June 30. But in spite of the setback, Ryanair maintained its full-year profit forecast of EUR400m and said 
its fuel requirements for the year were 90 per cent hedged at $820 a tonne.
Ryanair sets lower course as higher fuel bills bite
While confirming that there would be some short-term pain as the industry contracts, Ryanair said rivals' fuel price 
surcharges and the tough economic backdrop were making its own fares more attractive. "Generally, we love a 
good recession," said Mr Millar.
Passenger numbers rose 18 per cent to 21m in the three months to June although the comparisons with last year's 
total were flattered by the impact of the Icelandic ash cloud in April 2010, which grounded 9,400 of its flights across 
Europe.
The airline said passenger growth was expected to slow to 4 per cent in the winter but it would offset the impact on 
profits by grounding 80 aircraft over the season and raising ticket prices this year and in 2012. Average fares rose 
11 per cent to EUR43 a seat, still lower than its 2007 price of EUR45 a seat, but are expected to rise further this 
summer.
Ryanair has been increasing the proportion of revenues that it earns from add-on services such as baggage check-
in fees and priority boarding.
Ancillary sales grew 22 per cent to EUR248m in the quarter and now make up 21 per cent of total revenues. As part 
of that strategy, and in an echo of rival EasyJet , which is targeting business customers, the carrier said it was 
trialling reserved seating on selected routes at a cost of EUR5 for positions with extra legroom located at the front of 
the aircraft and by the escape hatches.
Revenues overall grew almost 30 per cent to EUR1.2bn in the quarter.
The airline was quick to counter criticism of its baggage levy, saying the charge had been brought in to lighten 
aircraft loads and to consolidate its position as a green-friendly airline. "We've got to change consumer habits. 
We've now got Mrs Millar down from seven pairs of shoes to three pairs of shoes," said Mr Millar.
Ryanair also said that it planned to sue BAA over what it believes are its inflated charges at Stansted airport.
"The Stansted cost base has been artificially boosted. We think they have been increasing their costs so they can 
jack up the charges on us," said Mr Millar.
A BAA spokesman said: "As of Friday we hadn't received anything from Ryanair. We'd obviously need to see what 
their case is before we could properly respond. Our charges are set by our regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, so 
it's difficult to understand what case Ryanair could have."

Lenders slump after Moody's warns over Greek default

European banks were hit by hefty losses after rating agency Moody's warned that default on Greek debt was now 
almost certain .
As peripheral debt yields climbed, the main stock indices fell. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index lost 0.4 per cent to 
close at 1,104.74, with banks exerting the most pressure as investors worried about the impasse in the US on   
raising the country's debt ceiling to avoid default .
"While the Greek debt deal goes a long way to present a fundamental solution to avoid the risk of a disorderly, 
forced Greek default and another banking crisis, fundamental risks are set to stay," said Lena Komileva at Brown 
Brothers Harriman.
The Athens General index fell 1.3 per cent, with Alpha Bank down 6.1 per cent to EUR3.38 and National Bank of 
Greece off 4.5 per cent to EUR5.12.
Focus also returned to the possibility of contagion to other periphery countries, primarily Italy, forcing the country's 
banks sharply lower. Intesa Sanpaolo sank 8.3 per cent to EUR1.61, undermined also by JPMorgan cutting its 
price target on the stock. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena shed 7.6 per cent to EUR0.51 and UniCredit lost 7.1 
per cent to EUR1.23.
Other banks considered to be heavily exposed to eurozone debt included Belgian lender Dexia , down 8.2 per cent 
to EUR1.95, while France's Crédit Agricole slid 5.5 per cent to EUR8.91.
In Ireland, Allied Irish Banks , the largely nationalised institution, climbed 8.9 per cent to EUR0.13½ despite 
making a EUR2.2bn underlying loss in the first half. Investors were cheered by the bank's assertion that 2011 would 
be the last year of big loan impairments.
Lenders slump after Moody's warns over Greek default
Bank of Ireland , meanwhile, stayed out of public control after the state sold a EUR1.1bn stake to a group of as yet 
unidentified investors. Shares climbed 1.5 per cent to EUR0.10.
Dublin's main stock index fell 0.3 per cent, however, as shares in Ryanair , one of its weightiest stocks, fell 1.8 per 
cent to EUR3.40 following the release of second-quarter profits that fell shy of expectations.
Fiat Industrial , the maker of tractors and commercial vehicles, was the Eurofirst's top stock, climbing 5.4 per cent 
to EUR9.47 as it raised its 2011 targets following a forecast-beating second- quarter profit performance. The 
company said it was now capable of paying a regular dividend.

Budget airline Ryanair says it plans to sue airports operator BAA over alleged overcharging at Stansted airport.
The airline released figures yesterday showing that high fuel costs had led profits for the first quarter of the year 
coming in below expectations.
Ryanair's finance director Howard Millar said the company believed it had been overcharged by "tens of millions" of 
pounds for using Stansted airport.
Millar claimed : "Passengers and airlines are subsidising BAA's other airports and paying a lot more than they need 
to go through Stansted." BAA responded by saying that Ryanair had no case for legal action and stressed that its 
costs and revenues were scrutinised by the Civil Aviation Authority which also regulates what it can charge airlines.

RYANAIR, Europe's largest low-cost airline, posted quarterly profits below market expectations due to higher fuel 
and operating costs yesterday.
The Irish airline, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day, said it expects average income yields to rise by 12 
to 15 per cent in its second quarter ending in September, but warned that traffic would fall four per cent in the next 
winter season as high fuel costs force the airline to ground flights.
Revenues in the three months to June grew 29 per cent to (EURO)1.16bn (£1.2bn), meeting market expectations.
But net profit was (EURO)139m, well short of the (EURO)151m forecast by a panel of analysts. Ryanair maintained 
its profit forecast for the year of (EURO)400m.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "Fuel prices remain stubbornly high." Ryanair also has confirmed 
yesterday it will launch legal action against BAA as it seeks to recover the "substantial overcharges" the airline 
believes it suffered due to "monopolistic" position of the airport operator. The move comes after regulators won a 
legal fight ordering BAA to sell Stansted.

The main Dublin shares index inched up this morning after news that Bank of Ireland looks set to stay out of 
majority State ownership and AIB published its latest set of results.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 1.94 points to 2,929.32.
A E1.1bn stake in Bank of Ireland has been sold to a group of unidentified investors in a deal that will keep the 
country's largest bank out of state control, the government has said this morning. The government had been widely 
expected to take control of Bank of Ireland, the last domestic lender outside of state ownership, after it agreed to 
underwrite a rights issues, whose results are due tomorrow. After the sale and rights issue, the government will now 
own a maximum of 32pc in the bank, the Department of Finance said. Shares in the bank edged up 1c to E0.11. 
"The emergence of a significant private investor is a major development for the bank itself while it also alleviates the 
overall Government's commitment to re-capitalising the business," said Joe Gill of Bloxham in Dublin.
AIB stocks gained 2c to E0.14 after it posted a E2.2 billion underlying first-half loss as its number of non-performing 
loans increased. But it said it expects 2011 to be the last year of major loan impairments. AIB, which is effectively 
nationalised, lost E22bn in deposits last year. The bank said customer deposits excluding those it purchased from 
failed lender Anglo Irish Bank fell by a further E5 billion for the year to end-June but were broadly stable in recent 
weeks. Shares in Ryanair rose 1c to E3.47 after it posted quarterly profits below market expectations due to higher 
fuel and operating costs. The airline, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day, said it expects average income 
yields to rise by 12 to 15pc in its second quarter ending in September, but warned traffic would fall 4pc in the next 
winter season as high fuel costs will force the airline to ground flights. "We note that that gross cash increased by 
E273.2m since March 31st 2011 to E3,213.8m. Net debt has fallen from E708.8m as at March 31st to E357.3m at 
the end of the quarter. We continue to believe that the company's capacity for cash generation should lead to 
further significant periodic cash returns to shareholders," according to Davy Stockbrokers.

The main Dublin shares market headed back in to negative territory today as fears over the US debt ceiling 
stalemate rose and investors reacted to the imminent downgrade for Greece.
The index dropped 12.42 points to 2,914.96.
Earlier in the session, the index inched up after news that Bank of Ireland looks set to stay out of majority State 
ownership and AIB published its latest set of results.
A E1.1bn stake in Bank of Ireland has been sold to a group of unidentified investors in a deal that will keep the 
country's largest bank out of state control, the government has said this morning. The government had been widely 
expected to take control of Bank of Ireland, the last domestic lender outside of state ownership, after it agreed to 
underwrite a rights issues, whose results are due tomorrow. After the sale and rights issue, the government will now 
own a maximum of 32pc in the bank, the Department of Finance said. Shares in the bank edged up 1c to E0.11. 
"The emergence of a significant private investor is a major development for the bank itself while it also alleviates the 
overall Government's commitment to re-capitalising the business," said Joe Gill of Bloxham in Dublin. BoI's shares 
were flat at E0.10. AIB stocks gained 1c to E0.14 after it posted a E2.2 billion underlying first-half loss as its number 
of non-performing loans increased. But it said it expects 2011 to be the last year of major loan impairments. AIB, 
which is effectively nationalised, lost E22bn in deposits last year. The bank said customer deposits excluding those 
it purchased from failed lender Anglo Irish Bank fell by a further E5 billion for the year to end-June but were broadly 
stable in recent weeks. Shares in Ryanair fell 6c to E3.40 after it posted quarterly profits below market expectations 
due to higher fuel and operating costs. The airline, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day, said it expects 
average income yields to rise by 12 to 15pc in its second quarter ending in September, but warned traffic would fall 
4pc in the next winter season as high fuel costs will force the airline to ground flights. "We note that that gross cash

(RTTNews) - The UK market is modestly lower in afternoon trading Monday, amid the backdrop of economic 
worries pertaining to the U.S. and Greece. Banks and insurers are particularly under pressure.

Bank of Scotalnd is losing 1.65 percent.

segmental results and the purchase of SSL International Plc boosted its net revenues.
Ryanair is falling 2.6 percent after the low-cost airline posted a slight rise in profit for the first quarter, owing to 
favorable comparisons with the prior year. Revenue increased 29 percent, but operating costs also climbed.
National Grid is up about 1 percent. The utility reaffirmed its outlook for fiscal 2012 and said it expects to deliver 
another year of "good" operating performance.
Gem Diamonds is advancing 1.7 percent. The company said it sees record prices for rough diamonds in the first-
half of the year.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX is falling 0.07 percent, and the French CAC 40 is losing 0.17 percent. 
Switzerland's SMI is dropping 0.10 percent.

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported a rise in profit for the first 
quarter, owing to favorable comparisons with the prior year, which was affected by ash cloud from the Icelandic 
volcano. Revenue increased 29 percent, but operating costs also climbed. The company left the outlook for the 
remainder of the year unchanged.
The Irish airline's profit attributable to equityholders of the parent increased to 139.3 million euros ($200.14 million) 
or 9.33 euro cents per share from 93.7 million euros or 6.30 euro cents per share in the prior year.
Prior-year results included the Icelandic volcanic ash related expenses of 50 million euros, excluding which 
earnings would have been 138.5 million euros.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, said, "Traffic growth in Q1 was flattered by the unnecessary airspace closures in 
April/ May 2010 (following the Icelandic volcanic eruptions) which led to the cancellation of 9,400 flights, and the 
loss of almost 1.5m passengers."
The company's pre-tax profit for the quarter advanced to 156.6 million euros from 104.6 million euros in the prior 
year.
Total operating revenues increased 29 percent to 1.16 billion euros from 896.8 million euros, as traffic increased 18 
percent and average fares rose 11 percent.
Meanwhile, total operating expenses increased 35 percent to 985.5 million euros, primarily due to an increase in 
fuel prices as well as costs associated with the growth of the airline. Unit costs climbed 14 percent due to a 49 
percent increase in fuel costs.
Passengers increased 18 percent to 21.3 million. The airline recently began trials of "reserved seating" for 21 extra 
legroom seats on selected routes for 10 euros per seat, and if successful, plans to extend this to more of its network 
this winter.
The carrier expects Dublin airport's traffic to decline in 2011 for the fourth time in a row, due to a 40 percent 
increase in airport charges that has led to winter capacity cuts by many airlines operating to Dublin.
For the year, the company continues to expect profit after tax similar to 400 million earned last year. The company 
noted that at present it has limited visibility on second-half bookings.
Ryanair Q1 Profit Rises; Maintains Full-year View - Update
Traffic in fiscal 2012 is estimated to grow 4 percent, comprising 10 percent growth in the first half and a fall of 
around 4 percent in the second half due to winter capacity cuts.
RYA.L closed Friday at 3.48 pence, up 0.18 pence or 5.42 percent, on 11.97 million shares.

  Investors will gain a clearer picture of the sustainability of the recovery in air travel next week when two of 
Europe's biggest airlines report earnings for the quarter to the end of June, writes Mark Odell .
Ryanair , Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, kicks off the European airline reporting season and is expected to 
report net profit of between EUR140m and EUR150m, compared with EUR93m a year earlier. The focus for most 
analysts will be how much management thinks it can push prices up for the rest of the year as it slows its rapid 
growth.
IAG , the holding company of the newly merged British Airways and Iberia, finishes the week with its second-
quarter earnings on Friday. Analysts expect the group to bounce back after the volcanic disruption and strikes that 
cost it EUR300m in the same quarter last year, while it continues to benefit from cost savings as it integrates the 
two airlines. The results are expected to be lifted further by strong business traffic, especially across the Atlantic.
Earnings before interest and tax are expected at about EUR170m against a pro forma loss of EUR71m in the 
second quarter last year.

  Deutsche Bank 's second-quarter results may be overshadowed if the bank's supervisory board also reaches a 
decision on how to replace Josef Ackermann as chief executive, writes James Wilson .
Corporate diary
The bank could move as early as this week to announce that Anshu Jain, head of the corporate and investment 
bank, and Jürgen Fitschen, the bank's head in Germany, will take over as co-chief executives, according to a 
proposal made by the head of the supervisory board.
The results are a first opportunity for Deutsche to reveal expected writedowns on its Greek sovereign exposure, last 
reported at a net EUR1.6bn at year-end. Analysts had been expecting Germany's biggest bank to announce 
quarterly net income of about EUR1.3bn, up from EUR1.2bn in the same quarter last year.

  ArcelorMittal  will provide guidance for the overall state of the world steel market when the world's biggest maker 
of the metal reveals its second-quarter results, writes Peter Marsh .
Lakshmi Mittal, the company's chairman and main owner, is expected to continue to express cautious optimism 
against a background of sluggish demand and increases in raw materials prices that have resulted in its share price 
performing weakly in recent months.
The company has indicated that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will be between 
$3bn and $3.5bn in the second quarter, after $2.6bn in the first three months of 2011.
Investors will hope that a stronger projection for ebitda in the quarter ending in September signals that demand in 
the industry is becoming closer to that prevailing before the 2008 financial crisis.
  SAP , the business software maker, returned to court this month to try to reduce the $1.3bn in damages awarded 
last year to arch-rival Oracle over copyright infringement by a former SAP subsidiary, writes Chris Bryant .
SAP hopes to cut its liability by at least two-thirds but a ruling is unlikely before it reports second-quarter results.
The company disappointed investors in April when its first-quarter profits fell short of expectations. Consensus 
opinion, however, suggests software licence sales may have picked up over the past three months.
Corporate diary
Solid recent results from Oracle and Accenture, the consulting company, suggest SAP may have enjoyed a better 
quarter this time round.
But a profit warning this month from Software AG, a business process software company, provides continued 
grounds for caution, although analysts consider the two companies to have very different product portfolios.

Ryanair shares have dropped by more than 2pc this morning after the no frills airline posted disappointing profit 
figures for its first quarter.
It shares were down by 7c a short time ago to 2,923.22.
The ISEQ index was also weak overall, showing a 4.16 point retreat at last viewing to 2,923.22.
It reflected a weakness across Europe on concern about the continuing debt crisis in the US. Both Bank of Ireland 
and AIB were flat in early trading this morning. Bank of Ireland held at 11c after confirming that it has agreed to sell 
a minitory stake of its equity to a mystery group of investors for 1.1bn euros. The deal looks like keeping it out of 
majority state control. AIB was unchanged at 13c after posting an underlying loss of 2.2bn euros in losses for its 
first half. Among the market's heavy hitters, CRH was up 2c to 1447 and Grafton was ahead by 2c to 297. DCC was 
down 1c to 1918, however, and Smurfit Kappa had shed 12c to stand at 737.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, has posted quarterly profits below market expectations due to higher fuel 
and operating costs.
The airline, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day, said it expects average income yields to rise by 12 to 15 
pc in its second quarter ending in September, but warned traffic would fall 4 pc in the next winter season as high 
fuel costs will force the airline to ground flights.
Revenues in the three months to June grew 29 pc to 1.16bn euros, meeting market expectations.
But net profit was 139 m euros, well short of the 151 m euros forecast by analysts. Ryanair has maintained its profit 
forecast for the year at 400m euros. Ryanair shares closed on Friday at 3.47 euros, up 3.2 pc since its 2011 results 
were announced on May 23. They are down 7c to 340 in early trade this morning. Ryanair said it was 90 pc hedged

Musgrave makes its move
Musgrave makes its move

Cork-based Musgrave Group hopes to get its hands on Superquinn after waiting the wings until the price was right, 
writes John Ruddy
For an industry so reticent about profit and revenue figures, the Irish grocery sector is notoriously bad at keeping 
secrets. So, the collapse of Superquinn and its apparent resurrection at the hands of the Cork-based Musgrave 
Group at the start of last week surprised few in the sector. Perhaps the real surprise was that it took all of 12 hours 
for details of the deal to emerge.
The real shocks came later in the week, though, when some of Superquinn's directors challenged the receivership. 
Whether they can derail the receivership and coax Superquinn into examinership will be decided in the coming 
days.
In the meantime, Musgrave is waiting in the wings to see if the various legal and competition hurdles can be 
overcome to allow the deal go ahead. Musgrave's interest in Superquinn has been brewing for years, but 
Superquinn's hefty price tag has always acted as a barrier to any deal.
In 2008,Musgrave was one of six retailers that took a close look at Superquinn, when its trading business and 
leaseholds on the stores were being touted around by Goldman Sachs.
Back then, the price being sought was said to be in the region of  250 million, with no property included. Musgrave 
had a war-chest of  150 million to fund any prospective deal, but with Superquinn looking for much more, Chris 
Martin, Musgrave chief executive and his team, backed out and took the next Ryanair flight back to Cork.
Fast forward to 2011, and the situation has changed dramatically. If it can complete the deal, Musgrave will get the 
trading business, all the Superquinn-branded stores, the distribution network and the freehold to the bulk of the 
retail properties for a little over  200 million.
Musgrave makes its move
As deals go, Musgrave has certainly brokered a better deal now than was on the table back in 2008; however, there 
are a number of major issues yet to be resolved.
Assuming the receivership goes ahead, the first major hurdle to overcome is the Competition Authority, which 
formally started an investigation into the proposed deal last Friday.
Musgrave's own calculations suggest that taking over Superquinn will not give the enlarged firm more than 30 per 
cent market share, which is generally held up as the threshold above which one firm can be deemed to have an 
overly dominant position.
The firm also argues that in Dublin - where Superquinn is strong and SuperValu is weak - even the combined 
market share of the two brands will still be less than that of its two main rivals, Dunnes Stores and Tesco.
However, some of Musgrave's rivals argue that market share is the wrong determinant, with retail sales a more 
appropriate benchmark. Musgrave, of course, is mainly a middle-man, and does not receive the full retail value of 
the  3.5 billion in goods that flow through SuperValu and Centra tills each year.
However, with the  500 million Superquinn business coming on stream - alongside a similar figure through 
Musgrave's existing cash and carry network - close to 40 per cent of all goods sold in a mainstream grocery setting 
will now be passing through Musgrave's hands at some stage in their life cycle.
So while Tesco and Dunnes might be privately glad that the likely buyer is Musgrave and not a new player like Asda 
or Sainsbury, they are still far from happy about the Musgrave coup. The second big issue for Musgrave is how it 
manages the diversification into a vertically-integrated or 'multiple' model.
In Ireland, Musgrave has always adopted a policy of not owning stores, taking the view that a franchised business 
and company-owned stores make for uneasy bedfellows. This will have to change now, with Musgrave planning to 
run Superquinn as a distinct division within its existing group structure - in other words, a multiple within a 
wholesaler.
On this front, there are those who argue that the best business decision would be for Musgrave to stick to what it 
does best, and pass on the stores to existing independent retailers. If that were to happen, Superquinn would 
effectively become a franchised business, just like SuperValu or Centra. However, the ramifications of that could be 
significant.
Despite the millions invested in the SuperValu brand, on the east coast and in Dublin in particular,S uperquinn is far 
closer to the hearts of many consumers - much of which is due to the work done by its former owner, Feargal 
Quinn. If Superquinn did become a franchised business, would scores of SuperValu retailers in the greater Dublin 
area not want to convert to a brand which remains more popular in the capital than SuperValu?
By sticking to a company-owned model, Musgrave can avoid these political wranglings, and can also control every 
aspect of the trading business - something which is far more difficult in a franchise scenario. Part of this desire for 
complete control is likely to result in a safe pair of hands being parachuted in from Musgrave to run the Superquinn 
business, with a number of candidates at middle management level in Cork.
Although not directly run by Musgrave family members any more, the company's almost messianic culture - which 
includes a heavy focus on loyalty, staff development and continuous training - means that a new stream of talent is 
always bubbling under the surface. Parachuting in a new boss will be made easier by the departure of Andrew 
Street, the Superquinn chief executive who quit on Thursday, blaming a dispute with the receiver and the way that 
suppliers were being treated.
However, it seems that Street favoured an attempt at examinership and was never likely to work with the receivers. 
Regardless of how this leadership issue plays out, there is little doubt that Musgrave will need to invest even further 
in the Superquinn chain.
Musgrave makes its move
Chris Martin said earlier this week that Musgrave ''really stretched'' itself to buy Superquinn. But a further 
investment of  20 million to  30 million - and potentially more - is needed to upgrade the Superquinn stores. 
Musgrave will also need to invest heavily in marketing to help convince Superquinn shoppers that the change in 
ownership should not provide a spur to switch to Tesco.
Price reductions and promotions will have to be beefed up to demonstrate to consumers that the 'New Superquinn' 
can punch above the market on quality, but keep up with Tesco and the discounters on price. Some of this will 
come through improved buying terms generated by greater scale, however, this will require supplier cooperation, 
which may be in short supply.
Already, the Superquinn business is reporting problems with deliveries and availability, with some suppliers holding 
back product until they get paid.
Issues like this should be resolved by the time Musgrave takes over, but that is not to say that suppliers are any 
happier with Musgrave than they are with KPMG or Superquinn.
Many suppliers are furious that they have been left high and dry as a result of the deal with Musgrave being done 
through the receivership process. Musgrave, they argue, makes a big deal of its core principles, including 'not being 
greedy'.
So why did it not make a provision for the debts owed to suppliers, with whom it will have to do business for many 
years? There are other difficulties emerging.
With every day of turmoil and upheaval - which has been exacerbated by the examinership petition - the value of 
the asset acquired by Musgrave is declining. For all KPMG's assertions that it is business as usual, the chaos and 
declining stocks on the shelves will push shoppers away.
While the Superquinn directors are working with a Lithuanian firm called Agile on the examinership plan, there is 
also talk in the trade that Morrisons, the  18 billion British chain headed by Irishman Dalton Philips, is keeping an 
eye on the situation. Late last week, Tesco was said to have thrown its hat into the ring.
Is it this potential for a better deal which is predicating the examinership appeal?
As the Musgrave chief executive's famous namesake in Coldplay once wrote, 'Nobody said it was easy'. However, 
even as canny an operator as Martin could never have thought it would be this hard.

Shares have surged in Dublin this morning as investors welcome last night's summit deal to stem the growth of 
Europe's debt crisis.
The ISEQ index has gained 50.54 points to stand a short time ago at 2,937.05.
The gains in Dublin mirror rise son other exchanges across Europe after the deal, which saw Ireland's bailout 
interest rate cut and a new Greek rescue package being agreed.
The euro zone's financial rescue fund was also given broader powers to help prevent contagion in the region. Most 
of Dublin's big names rose this morning, headed by a 57c jump in CRH shares to 1483. DCC is up 16c to 1930, 
with Ryanair lifting by 15c to 345, Smurfit Kappa by 20c to 734 and Elan by 8c to 883. Among the party poopers 
were Kerry Group, down 13c to 2879, and Kingspan off by 3c to 691.

Caribbean budget airline to fly to Trinidad

KINGSTON, Jamaica The Caribbean's first discount airline has received the go-ahead to fly to Trinidad, ending a 
monthslong conflict with government regulators.
Ian Burns, the Irish CEO of short-haul, low-cost REDjet, announced Tuesday that commercial flights between the 
airline's Barbados hub and Trinidad will begin July 28. Booking for tickets has started.
"We are delighted to bring low fares to passengers and still believe that the REDjet model is a compelling consumer 
proposition that will revolutionize travel in the Caribbean," Burns said from Barbados.
Burns has previously blamed delays in getting flight authorization to a political fear of competition for the region's 
government-affiliated carriers.
Trinidad, the home of government-affiliated Caribbean Airlines, denied REDjet entry for months, citing safety and 
other regulatory concerns. Trinidadian officials only authoritized REDjet's entry after the country's civil aviation 
agency settled a lawsuit by Airone Holdings Limited, the airline's owner. Terms of the deal have not been disclosed 
by either side.
The carrier has so far only been operating routes from Barbados to Guyana, using two 149-seat MD-82 passenger 
jets.
In a statement, Trinidad's transport minister, Devant Majaraj, said all the "stringent regulatory requirements 
including safety have been met and are complied with."
"We are certain that the consuming public in Trinidad and Tobago and the region would welcome a choice in air 
travel at this time. It is reflective of this country's commitment to the region and to the development of our Caricom 
partners," Majaraj said.
A spokeswoman with Caribbean Airlines, which recently concluded its acquisition of Air Jamaica, did not 
immediately return calls for comment. Air Jamaica has racked up about $1.2 billion in debt.
Caribbean budget airline to fly to Trinidad
REDjet is clearing hurdles in other islands it hopes to operate from. This week, Oscar Derby, director-general of the 
Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority, said island authorities had no more safety concerns about REDjet.
On Tuesday, Jamaica's Ministry of Transport said REDjet was close to getting authorization to fly to the island but 
the government was not ready to make an official announcement.
Burns, a former partner of a British accounting firm, has said he hopes to create a Caribbean version of Europe's 
cut-rate Ryanair by advertising flights for as little as $10. He says REDjet will make it dramatically easier for people 
across the islands to fly and do business. People in the Caribbean have long complained that costly, inefficient air 
service has held back investment and jobs.
Aviation analysts agree a low-fare alternative is needed since the Caribbean is one of the costliest airline markets in 
the world.
Burns predicted REDjet will succeed by cutting costs and frills: no free food or business class service, fast 
turnarounds at airports to save on parking fees, no overnighting by staff and only Internet reservations to eliminate 
booking offices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has barred Barbados-based carriers from flying to the U.S. because the 
island does not meet international standards for monitoring airline operations.
Burns has said U.S. flights are not a priority at the moment.

BAA said it is considering judicial review after the Competition Commission ruled yesterday that the airport operator 
must sell Stansted and Glasgow or Edinburgh airport.
In its final report, the commission said that the sales process for London's third-largest airport Stansted would start 
in three months' time, and would be followed by the sale of one of the Scottish airports.
Colin Matthews, BAA's chief executive, said he was "dismayed" by the Competition Commission's final decision and 
said it was looking at its legal options with regards to the ruling.
"The Competition Commission has not recognised that the world and BAA have changed. This decision would 
damage our company which is investing strongly in UK jobs and growth," he said.
The group, controlled by Spain's Ferrovial, also argued that being forced to sell in a difficult market could destroy 
shareholder value.
The report ends a two year battle between BAA and the CC, who in 2009 ruled that BAA exerted a dominant hold 
on UK airports and told it to sell Gatwick, Stansted and one of its Scottish airports.
"The CC has concluded that the sale of the airports is fully justified and that passengers and airlines would still 
benefit from greater competition with the airports under separate ownership," the CC said in a statement.
TIME LINE | BAA'S BATTLES June 2006: The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) announced it would review the UK 
airports market.

April 2007: The OFT refers BAA to the Competition Commission (CC) to investigate the supply of airport services

Sept 2007: The CC publishes it initial findings calling for a fundamental restructure of BAA following its "poor

April 2008: Colin Matthews takes the reins as chief executive, succeeding Stephen Nelson.
March 2009: The CC orders BAA to sell off Stansted airports and either Edinburgh or Glasgow, in a move against 
the group's monopoly.

The swift decline of UK media titan Rebekah Brooks

Rebekah Brooks dined with Britain's prime minister over Christmas and got a public show of support from her boss 
Rupert Murdoch before the cameras this month as allegations of phone hacking on her watch mounted.
Now the 43-year-old U.K. media executive is a criminal suspect, her world of power and connections shattered by 
scandal.
Brooks, who quit as head of Murdoch's British newspapers Friday, was arrested Sunday in a widening investigation 
into years of alleged phone hacking of hundreds of celebrities, politicians and even murder victims, as well as 
bribing police for information, at the now-shuttered tabloid News of the World. Scotland Yard released her on bail 
after about 12 hours in custody.
The arrest sealed Brooks' swift transformation from one of Britain's most powerful female executives to a figure of 
scorn and even parody.
On Sunday, an Irish discount airline seized on perceptions of Brooks as an outlaw, placing an ad in The Observer 
newspaper that showed a photograph of the longtime Murdoch confidant, said to be so close to him that she was 
seen as family.
"Hacked Off with High Fares... I'm outta here with Ryanair!" the caption crowed.
The implications of Brooks' arrest stretch far beyond her own circumstances, with questions about the extent to 
which the scandal rocking Britain's media establishment will dismantle the chain of command in Murdoch's business 
empire and erode the stature of Prime Minister David Cameron and other politicians who had once-cozy ties to the 
80-year-old press baron.
Another of Murdoch's chief executives, Wall Street Journal publisher Les Hinton, also had to resign Friday after 
more than 50 years with Murdoch. James Murdoch, head of European and Asian operations for his father's 
company, News Corp., is under increasing scrutiny. He and the senior Murdoch, along with Brooks, face 
questioning Tuesday by British lawmakers investigating the scandal.
The swift decline of UK media titan Rebekah Brooks
Brooks has been at the center of the storm since the scandal broke.
Recognizable by a long shock of curly red hair, the 43-year-old Brooks was a loyal lieutenant of Murdoch and 
served as editor of the News of the World for part of the time when the tabloid's journalists allegedly hacked into 
telephone messages.
Reports of illegal eavesdropping had percolated for years, but revelations that journalist had hacked into the voice 
mail of a 13-year-old murder victim, Milly Dowler, in 2002 caused a public uproar.
The scandal was deemed toxic for the tabloid, and Murdoch shut down the 168-year-old newspaper. Brooks was 
vilified for initially clinging to her job while 200 other journalists lost theirs.
Brooks' career with the News of the World began in 1989, after briefly working for Murdoch's group as a secretary. 
She started as a features writer, then became features editor, associate editor and ultimately deputy editor. She left 
the tabloid in 1998 to become deputy editor of Murdoch's other London tabloid, The Sun, where she stayed for two 
years.
When Brooks returned to the News of the World as editor in 2000, she was only 31 years old a feat for Britain's 
press establishment.
She peppered the tabloid with celebrity scandals, and drew praise for using the newspaper as a platform to help get 
sex offender legislation, known as "Sarah's Law," passed in Britain. Brooks' controversial campaign to publicly 
identify pedophiles drew criticism from some police, who said it disrupted investigations and could lead to cases of 
mistaken identity, but she defended it on the grounds that the public had the right to know.
In another stint at The Sun, another Murdoch tabloid, Brooks became its first female editor in 2003. She thumbed 
her nose at critics who expected her to end tabloid's daily topless model pictures on page 3, attaching a headline 
that said "Rebekah from Wapping" to the photo of a nude model of the same name on her first day on the job.
Six years and a host of scoops later, Brooks was named chief executive of News International, joining the elite 
circle of Murdoch confidants.
No longer drafting the headlines from her perch in the executive suite, Brooks has still made plenty of them from her 
lunches and social calls with top politicians to one unusual brush with the law.
In 2005, Brooks was arrested for allegedly attacking her husband, soap-opera star Ross Kemp. No charges were 
filed.
Brooks's second marriage, to former racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, came in 2009. The couple have been known 
to rub shoulders with some of Britain's most prominent politicians and appear at society events from Windsor Castle 
to Wimbledon.
Brooks cultivated a close friendship not just with Cameron of the Conservative Party, but with the wives of ex-Prime 
Ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair of Labour.

News In Brief
## Breaking up the health insurer VHI would wipe up to 475m euros in value off the company due to the loss of 
economies of scale, according to a report commissioned by the company. The report by IBI Corporate Finance says 
the company would be left with a loss of 110m euros for the three years from 2011 to 2013 if it were broken up, 
compared with a surplus of 85m euros for the same period. A break-up would lead to additional claims and 
operating expenditure costs of about 65m euros a year as well as one-off costs of about 14m euros, IBI says. The 
company could lose up to 475m euros in value in a break-up based on multiple of earnings at international insurers 
and 302m euros based on equivalent values for Irish general insurers, IBI says. - Irish Times
## The charitable trust established in memory of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, with a fund of over 11m euros, failed 
to make any charitable donations last year. The Tony Ryan Trust was incorporated on December 10, 2009, with the 
core objectives of the advancement of education and religion, the relief of poverty, and other charitable works. 
However, in accounts just filed to the Companies Office for the period December 10, 2009, to December 31, 2010, 
the directors' report confirms that "the company did not distribute any of its funds during the period". The figures 
reveal the money available for distribution has increased to 11.5m euros through the fund accumulating 1.5m euros 
in interest and other income. A breakdown of the increase in the fund shows that 988,994 euros was made through 
the sale of shares and 543,373 euros was made through the receipt of dividends. - Irish Independent
## The High Court has appointed inspectors to Dublin wealth management company Custom House Capital to 
investigate the affairs of the company on an application by the Central Bank amid serious concerns about its 
operations. The Central Bank said in a statement it sought the appointment "due to new information arising which 
led to significant concerns about the firm's operations". George Treacy, head of the Central Bank's division that 
supervises investment companies, and Noel Thompson, a manager in the division, were appointed inspectors to

household charge. He said that when proposals are brought to cabinet, discussions will begin on how such a 
charge would be constructed, what level it would be at, who would be paying it and whether there would be 
allowances for those in financial difficulties or on low incomes. Mr Gilmore said there would be a difficult year ahead 
for householders as tough decisions had to be made in the autumn on efforts to raise revenue and reduce 
expenditure. - RTE ## Representatives of some of the 18 religious congregations that managed residential 
institutions for children investigated by the Ryan commission may not attend a meeting with the Minister for 
Education Ruairi Quinn next Friday in protest. They have been invited to the meeting to discuss a 200m euro 
shortfall in an expected 50:50 contribution by them to costs incurred by the state in compensating former residents 
of the institutions. Last week Mr Quinn said: "I'm asking them for a 50:50 contribution. The taxpayer has already 
paid out the bulk of it. Their share should be about 680m euros and they are half shy of that . . . they need to do far 
more." The Irish Times has learned that the congregations never agreed to make a 50:50 contributions to such 
state costs, nor was this a recommendation of the report. It is also their intention to ensure that any additional 
contributions they make will go to survivors and not to the state. - Irish Times

more." The Irish Times has learned that the congregations never agreed to make a 50:50 contributions to such 
state costs, nor was this a recommendation of the report. It is also their intention to ensure that any additional 
contributions they make will go to survivors and not to the state. - Irish Times

WATCHDOG IN PENSION VICTORY Britain's Pensions Regulator has dropped the threat of action against US-
based Chemtura Corp and its UK subsidiary, after the company agreed to pay £60m into its pension scheme over 
the next three years. In December 2010, the regulator issued a formal warning to Chemtura Corp and Chemtura 
Manufacturing UK that it was considering seeking a Financial Support Direction to force contributions to the 
underfunded pension scheme of the UK business. Chemtura Corp had been involved in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceeding in the US.
HEDGE FUND "LOOTED" AFFILIATE, CLAIMS LAWSUIT One of the world's biggest hedge funds "looted" 
hundreds of millions of dollars from a listed company it controlled by manipulating its accounts, a new US lawsuit 
alleges. The shareholder action, filed on Monday in New York, accuses Londonbased Polygon Investment Partners 
of misvaluing toxic structured assets in a supposedly independent affiliate, Tetragon Financial Group, in order to 
earn huge fees over the past three years at the expense of its investors.
BRUSSELS TO INVESTIGATE VW AND BMW OVER AID REGIME More than (EURO)100m ($141m) of 
investment aid to two of Germany's biggest carmakers - BMW and Volkswagen - is to be investigated by Brussels 
to see whether it complies with European Union rules. Competition officials at the European Commission said on 
Wednesday that they would look into German government plans to grant (EURO)46m of regional aid towards a 
(EURO)368m electric car project at a BMW plant in Leipzig, to see whether it was compatible with EU state aid 
rules. The project involves the manufacture of two models of electic cars.
RYANAIR FALLS FOUL OF SPANISH RULES OVER CHILDREN Ryanair faces legal action in Spain for refusing to 
allow children to fly unless they carry passports or national identity documents. Under Spanish law, under-14s are 
permitted to travel if an accompanying adult presents a Family Record Book. The National Institute of Consumers, 
part of the Health Ministry, has advised the public prosecutor's office to take action against the Irish airline.
WHAT THE OTHER PAPERS SAY THIS MORNING
CARD FACTORY ADDS PERSONAL TOUCH ONLINE Card Factory has caught the bug for customised cards and 
gifts, buying one of Britain's ten biggest gift websites and joining what has become the latest online gold rush. The 
private equity-owned chain of 570 greetings card shops has bought GettingPersonal.co.uk.
GOLD ATM MACHINE AT WESTFIELD SHOPPING CENTRE Gold vending machines are to be placed in every 
major city in Britain after the country's first machine was switched on in Westfield shopping centre. The company 
behind the gold bar vending machines plans to install 50 across Britain over the next few years, allowing ordinary 
shoppers to invest in the precious metal.
RENTS RISE AS HOMES REMAIN IN SHORT SUPPLY A shortage of homes to let has forced rent levels higher 
and further increased the squeeze on cashstrapped consumers, according to research. The Association of 
Residential Lettings Agents found 56% of its members reported that rents had risen over the past six months, 
compared with 53pc three months ago.
HARTFORD ISSUES PROFIT WARNING Hartford Financial Services warned that second-quarter profit fell by 
about 68 per cent on the increased cost of natural disasters and a charge related to asbestos policies it sold years 
ago.
Net income of about $24m declined from $76m in the same period a year earlier, the company said in a statement 
yesterday disclosing preliminary results.
BORDERS CREDITORS OBJECT TO BID Borders Group could be worth more dead than alive, publishers and 
landlords said in a court filing yesterday, raising the stakes in a looming bankruptcy-court auction that will determine 
whether the bookstore chain survives. Borders's creditors committee objected to a bid for the chain from private-
equity firm Najafi, contending that an offer from liquidators would pay creditors more.

The ISEQ recovered some lost ground this morning despite last night's downgrade by Moody's of Ireland's 
sovereign debt status to "junk".
By 10:30, the index had gained 18.45 points to 2,905.59.
Last night, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Irish sovereign debt by one notch to Ba1 from Baa3 with the 
outlook on the rating remaining 'negative'. Clearly, the downgrade to non-investment-grade status will impair the 
ability of the sovereign to re-engage with private markets when the current EU/IMF deal runs out in mid-2013. That 
said, both Fitch and Standard and Poors maintain Ireland's credit rating three levels above junk status. Moody's 
identified several factors underpinning its decision to downgrade Ireland. First, it has interpreted recent EU 
negotiations on a new Greek funding package as raising the probability of private sector participation as a 
precondition for any additional EU funding support to Ireland. For example, a rollover of existing private debt 
holdings, at yields lower than current market rates. Second, uncertainty on the outlook for the Irish economy, 
particularly domestic demand, has heightened the risk around the implementation of the government's fiscal 
adjustment plan.
Recent market weakness has seen the European cement sector sell off sharply. The sector is down 18pc on 
average since end-April. HeidelbergCement (HEI) has not been spared, with the share price down 20pc in two 
months. Consensus estimates have also moved lower across the sector, reflecting higher input cost inflation and 
weaker- than-expected construction activity in North America. EBITDA estimates are down 2.5pc on average since 
April. We believe HEI is best placed among the cement producers to increase prices and pass on higher input 
costs, and we recommend taking advantage of recent weakness to buy the shares. Shares in Irish cement giant, 
CRH, jumped 25c to E13.98. Abbey will release its FY 2011 preliminary results tomorrow, July 14th. Davy expect 
Abbey to report EPS of 42c, a net cash position of E492m and shareholder funds of E168.6m. We are forecasting 
ISEQ rises despite Irish junk status ISEQ Up
that the group will report revenue of E77m (-20.8pc year-on-year), from 340 completions. Shares in the firm were 
flat at E5.01. Ryanair is due to report Q112 results on Monday, July 25. We are forecasting revenue of E1,180m 
and net income of E147.4m (E93.7m in Q1 last year, but E138.5m on an adjusted basis). While yields are 
improving in the current year, the increase in the fuel bill in Q1 (almost 50pc) was a material headwind for the airline 
at the start of the fiscal year. "Ryanair has guided yields up 12pc for the full year, operating expenses per pax ex 
fuel up 7pc per pax (2pc sector length adjusted) and the fuel bill up E350m yoy. We think it unlikely the company 
will budge on these figures at the Q1 results stage," said Goodbody Stockbrokers.

* Uniq, the convenience food group that was put up for sale by its pension fund this year, is to be bought by Irish 
rival Greencore for £113 million.
* Huang Guangyu, a Chinese tycoon serving a 14-year fraud sentence in a Beijing prison, has put in a bid for the

The Lex Column
* Cisco: purge or a diet? In the gritty business of selling and servicing clients' technological infrastructure, 
competitors must constantly shift their mix of business.
* News Corp: buy-back - rational shareholders should not only be indifferent to buy-backs in theory - this week's 
market convulsions show how pointless they can be in practice.
* High-frequency trading: slaves to the algorithm - traders may disrupt share prices from time to time, but fears 
about high frequency trading posing a systemic risk look overblown.
* Italy: still structurally flawed - a solution for Greece in the form of a steep haircut for its creditors should stop the 
eurozone rot from extending outwards to embrace Italy.
* BSkyB / News Corp - following the UK phone-hacking scandal that threatens to scupper the BSkyB deal, investors 
must now price in a Murdoch Jr discount.

* The inflation rate will head higher again as new spikes in commodity and energy costs feed through; exports and

Investment Column
* Yell is a speculative buy; buy Computacenter and UK Coal.

* Of all the banks with a stake in the reform of financial regulation, Standard Chartered is worth listening to most 
closely.
* Pirc, the corporate governance group, can be forgiven for the fact that much of the long note it published 
yesterday on News Corp and BSkyB might have been condensed into just four words: "We told you so".

Viewpoint Column
* Thomas Cook faces a long journey back - the travel operator plans to review its UK business model after this

* A Murdochian sub-plot - Rupert Murdoch has thrown a bone to News Corp shareholders, but it doesn't amount to 
much.
* European debt crisis: eurozone fallout is too late to control - eurozone leaders have themselves to blame: the best

Polish investigators have concluded that inadequate planning resulted in a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 crew's 
mistaking the location of Katowice airport on approach and descending far below the glideslope.
The twinjet reached a radio altimeter height of 247ft (75m) before the aircraft climbed away after aborting its 
approach.
Weather conditions were good, and flight FR8226, arriving from Bristol on 10 March 2008, had been cleared for a 
visual approach to Runway 09, meaning it was flying towards the morning sun. While the cockpit recorder was 
overwritten before analysis, flight-data recorder information shows the 737 left its cruise altitude of 41,000ft about 
18min before the incident.
At 1,050ft the jet was in landing configuration, but Polish investigation agency PKBWL said the crew - whose 
forward visibility was "restricted" by the sun's position - had "mistakenly determined the location" of the airport, 
realising the error at about 500ft. The 737 had descended from 24,000ft under 'idle' power, which the inquiry said 
was "inconsistent" for a stabilised approach. The engines took time to spool up and terrain warnings sounded at 
about 370ft, while the jet was still 3nm (5.5km) from the airport.
Despite the lack of cockpit voice data, PKBWL said "inadequate" crew resource management "probably contributed 
[to] a lack of information exchange" between the two pilots.
It also questioned whether the disparate levels of experience - the captain had 21,800h while the first officer had 
1,020h - contributed to the situation. It said an "authority-apprentice" relationship is "extremely delicate".
After executing the go-around the aircraft returned to land safely. Katowice had an instrument-landing system at the 
time, but on the opposite-direction Runway 27, while its navigation aids were limited to a non-directional beacon 
rather than distance-measuring equipment.

Sale: Lyons Demesne: Works of art from the collection of the late Dr Tony Ryan
Location: Christie's, 8 King Street, London SW1 tel +44 (0)20 7839 1611
Date: Thursday (July 14). On view Sunday, 2pm-5pm; Monday 9am-4.30pm; Tuesday, 9am-8pm; Wednesday 9am-
4.30pm. Catalogue on line at www.christies.com 
Need to know: Lyons Demesne was a grand house in a very sorry state when it was bought by the late airline 
tycoon Tony Ryan in 1996. The architectural gem at Ardclough, Co Kildare was commissioned by the first Lord 
Cloncurry from architect Oliver Grace in 1797 and had been among Ireland's finest houses until it became a 
satellite of University College, Dublin, which carved up its great rooms for use as laboratories.
But Ryan, the billionaire co-founder of Ryanair, was undaunted by the prospect of restoring the house and 
employed a crack team of architects, builders and craftsmen to return it to its former glory in less than three years. 
All that the philanthropist and patron of the arts had to do after that was to fill the house with the appropriate 
paintings and furniture - this 400-lot sale comprises a relatively small selection of what he amassed prior to his 
death in 2007.
Highlights: With estimates ranging from £300-£300,000, the sale is expected to realise more than £2m and is led by 
an impressive 18th-century pastel portrait of Arthur Hill, second Marquess of Downshire, drawn by Hugh Douglas 
Hamilton. Ryan bought it at a Christie's sale in 2000 for £377,750. In the same year, he paid £91,750 for a set of six 
Louis XV giltwood fauteuils which are now on offer at £40,000- £60,000 while a Joshua Reynolds portrait of a 
woman, bought at Sotheby's in 1999 for £140,000, is now estimated at £50,000- £80,000. Elsewhere, the sale is 
replete with a diverse array of objects priced in the mid-range, including a large bird cage in the form of a 17th-
century mansion (£10,000-£15,000), drawings by Sir Edwin Landseer, Samuel Laurence and Augustus John, four-
poster beds, painted furniture, longcase clocks and marble sculptures - in short, all the essentials for decorating a 
magnificent country house.

Irish shares have wobbled early on today as global markets await key US jobs figures later today.
The ISEQ index began slightly ahead but has retreated to go 3.13 points down in recent minutes to 2,965.04.
In other European markets, things have been a tad more positive, after gains on Wall Street and in Asia.
The gains reflect hopes that the US labour data may come in strongly, confirming the strength of the recovery in the 
world's biggest economy. In Dublin, builders' provider and DIY chain Grafton dropped by 25c to 309 after reporting 
a revenue rise of just 2pc for this year so far. Other construction related names also slipped. CRH is down 15c to 
1475 and Kingspan has dipped by 10c to 715. Other big names did better, with DCC up 2c to 2039, Smurfit Kappa 
adding 6c to 854 and Kerry Group rising by 26c to 2949. Ryanair edged 1c higher to 346. Elsewhere in Europe, the 
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.2pc a short time ago at 1,126.04 points, after rising 0.4 pc 
yesterday to its highest close in five weeks, buoyed by US job hopes. Stocks have risen across the board, with the 
heavyweight banking sector among the gainers. The STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index is up by 0.3 pc. "It's all 
about the non-farm payrolls. The market will be expecting a higher number after the ADP report," Philip Isherwood, 
European equities strategist at Evolution Securities, said. "It seems to me the soft patch that people thought would 
turn into recession is overstated." Across the continent this morning, the FTSE 100 is up 0.11pc in London, with the 
Dax listing by 0.3pc in Frankfurt and the CAC-40 advancing by 0.23pc in Paris.

The ISEQ fell sharply today as investors sold off in Ireland and on markets around the world following dismal and 
worrying jobs creation figures from the US and as Grafton shares slumped.
The index dropped 24.64 points to 2,943.53.
Building supplies group Grafton posted a 2pc rise in first-half revenue and said markets in Ireland and Britain were 
struggling to recover in the face of weak consumer sentiment. Grafton, which made over two thirds of its revenue in 
Britain last year, said its performance was aided by better weather in the first quarter but the rate of growth had 
moderated since. The company's downbeat assessment that trading in its key markets was slow to recover in the 
face of weak mortgage lending and low levels of consumer confidence hit its shares, which were down 9pc at one 
point at E3.031, a seven-month low, before recovering slightly to E3.05. "A lot of people had factored in some 
growth in Ireland, that they would sustain the levels that they were at. That doesn't look like it's going to happen," 
said one trader.
Investor's eyes were on the US following an important jobs index. U.S. stocks plunged after weak jobs growth in 
June dented hopes the economy was emerging from a soft patch, but the start of earnings season next week kept 
investors engaged. U.S. employers hired a mere 18,000 workers, the Labor Department said, the fewest number in 
nine months and far below economists' expectations for a 90,000 rise. The selloff was broad as the report dashed 
expectations that the labour market would show more signs of strength after some encouraging jobs numbers 
during the week. "Clearly one bad month of jobs can be dismissed, two disappointments in a row starts to be a 
concern," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "Earnings season can't come 
soon enough. That will give us a really good handle on our overall trajectory." The US House of Representatives 
has released its proposals for a new multi-year highway programme. The proposal - no bill has been published at 
this time - indicates a six-year budget of dollar 230bn (dollar 38.3bn per annum), a 30pc decline from the levels

agreed under the previous SAFETEA-LU programme. Given that there is no split in terms of different modes of 
transport, it is not possible to see the impact on highway spending specifically. Shares in CRH dropped 71c to 
E14.19. NCB analyst, Brian Devine, said the brokers have reinstated coverage of its Irish/UK airlines universe with 
a positive medium term view. It is rating Aer Lingus a BUY, Ryanair an ACCUMULATE and easyJet a HOLD. "The 
sharp increase in jet fuel prices has increased operating expenses substantially, damaging near term earnings 
prospects, but medium term prospects are healthier with substantial cash generation expected from our universe 
over the cycle. As the market gets comfortable with structurally higher oil prices and yield increases work their way 
through the system we expect the focus to shift to the positive cash flow prospects for our airlines in the medium 
term." Shares in Aer Lingus fell 2c to E0.69 while Ryanair stocks were down 1c at E3.44.

The ISEQ fell sharply today as investors sold off in Ireland and on markets around the world following dismal and 
worrying jobs creation figures from the US and as Grafton shares slumped.
The index dropped 24.64 points to 2,943.53.
Building supplies group Grafton posted a 2pc rise in first-half revenue and said markets in Ireland and Britain were 
struggling to recover in the face of weak consumer sentiment. Grafton, which made over two thirds of its revenue in 
Britain last year, said its performance was aided by better weather in the first quarter but the rate of growth had 
moderated since. The company's downbeat assessment that trading in its key markets was slow to recover in the 
face of weak mortgage lending and low levels of consumer confidence hit its shares, which were down 9pc at one 
point at E3.031, a seven-month low, before recovering slightly to E3.05. "A lot of people had factored in some 
growth in Ireland, that they would sustain the levels that they were at. That doesn't look like it's going to happen," 
said one trader.
Investor's eyes were on the US following an important jobs index. U.S. stocks plunged after weak jobs growth in 
June dented hopes the economy was emerging from a soft patch, but the start of earnings season next week kept 
investors engaged. U.S. employers hired a mere 18,000 workers, the Labor Department said, the fewest number in 
nine months and far below economists' expectations for a 90,000 rise. The selloff was broad as the report dashed 
expectations that the labour market would show more signs of strength after some encouraging jobs numbers 
during the week. "Clearly one bad month of jobs can be dismissed, two disappointments in a row starts to be a 
concern," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "Earnings season can't come 
soon enough. That will give us a really good handle on our overall trajectory." The US House of Representatives 
has released its proposals for a new multi-year highway programme. The proposal - no bill has been published at 
this time - indicates a six-year budget of dollar 230bn (dollar 38.3bn per annum), a 30pc decline from the levels

agreed under the previous SAFETEA-LU programme. Given that there is no split in terms of different modes of 
transport, it is not possible to see the impact on highway spending specifically. Shares in CRH dropped 71c to 
E14.19. NCB analyst, Brian Devine, said the brokers have reinstated coverage of its Irish/UK airlines universe with 
a positive medium term view. It is rating Aer Lingus a BUY, Ryanair an ACCUMULATE and easyJet a HOLD. "The 
sharp increase in jet fuel prices has increased operating expenses substantially, damaging near term earnings 
prospects, but medium term prospects are healthier with substantial cash generation expected from our universe 
over the cycle. As the market gets comfortable with structurally higher oil prices and yield increases work their way 
through the system we expect the focus to shift to the positive cash flow prospects for our airlines in the medium

The ISEQ dipped lower again this morning led by Grafton after it said the Irish and British markets remain weak.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 16.12 points to 2,952.05.
Building supplies group Grafton posted a 2 percent rise in first-half revenue and said markets in Ireland and Britain 
were struggling to recover in the face of weak consumer sentiment. Grafton, which made over two thirds of its 
revenue in Britain last year, said on Friday its performance was aided by better weather in the first quarter but the 
rate of growth had moderated since. The company's downbeat assessment that trading in its key markets was slow 
to recover in the face of weak mortgage lending and low levels of consumer confidence hit its shares, which were

factored in some growth in Ireland, that they would sustain the levels that they were at. That doesn't look like it's 
going to happen," said one trader.
Investor's eyes will be on the US this afternoon ahead of key jobs data. The US non-farm payrolls report released 
this afternoon is expected to show employment growth of 105,000 in June, up from 54,000 in May, but remaining 
below levels close to 200,000 earlier in the year. Expectations for the US employment number have become more 
optimistic following yesterday's ADP employment report, indicating growth of 157,000 on the month in June. The 
ADP report correctly indicated the sharp slowdown in the official payrolls employment in May. Furthermore, initial 
jobless claims fell back to 418,000 in the first week of July, indicating a further improvement in US labour market 
conditions. The US House of Representatives has released its proposals for a new multi-year highway programme. 
The proposal - no bill has been published at this time - indicates a six-year budget of dollar 230bn (dollar 38.3bn per

NO-FRILLS airline easyJet yesterday reported a 9.1 per cent rise in passenger numbers in June compared with last 
year, in line with its rivals, as its expansion plan takes flight.
In the 12 months to June, easyJet sold 53.36m seats on its flights - a jump of 12 per cent on last year.
The rise builds on a seven per cent rise in passenger numbers during 2010, as the firm expands its reach across 
European flight routes.
The firm's rapid growth plans have sparked tension with the airline's founder and ongoing shareholder Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, who has complained to the board that the plane purchases and route expansions are unsustainable.
EasyJet also announced yesterday that its load factor - a measure of the the percentage of seats sold per flight - 
has risen 1.1 percentage point to 88.3 per cent in June compared with last year.
Ryanair and BA parent company IAG have this week also reported a rise in traffic compared with last year.

The ISEQ fell sharply this morning amid fears that the latest downgrade for Portugal will spread the crisis and that 
Ireland could be next to have its sovereign debt rated "junk".
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 23.90 points to 2,979.16.
Ireland's credit rating may be cut to junk by Moody's Investors Service after Portugal yesterday lost its investment 
grade rating, analysts said today. Moody's, which slashed Portugal four notches yesterday to Ba2 from Baa1, in 
April lowered Ireland's credit rating to the lowest investment grade Baa3 and left country's outlook on negative. The 
ratings company cut Portugal's rating in part because the nation may not be able to return to debt markets in the 
second half of 2013. "While Ireland has thus far managed to maintain its investment grade status, contagion risks 
are highlighted by this latest ratings move from Moody's. Moody's currently has Ireland at Baa3 with a negative 
outlook, which is the lowest investment grade rating. While Fitch and S&P have the sovereign rated marginally 
higher at BBB+", said Goodbodys.
CRH has reported that it has spent E186m on 21 acquisitions / investments in the six months to June end, which 
compares to E367m on 14 deals in the second half of 2010 and E133m on 13 acquisitions in first half of last year. 
The announced deals should add incremental sales of c.E130m. In addition to the completed spend of E186m, 
CRH has agreed to acquire VVM Group, a materials business in Belgium but is subject to regulatory approval. 
Including VVM total acquisition spend increase to c. E300m. Shares in CRH fell 20c to E14.81. Packaging group, 
DS Smith announced that it has received an offer for its UK office wholesaling business, Spicers, valuing the 
business at £200m. "Since the new CEO arrived at DS Smith, the focus has been on developing the packaging 
business. Spicers' future within the company was always in doubt," said Davy. Shares in Smurfit Kappa fell 9c to 
E8.52. Ryanair reported June passenger statistics yesterday showing 9pc growth in June to 7.33m. The load factor 
was 84pc for the month, flat compared to a year ago. "The June data now allows us to square off the volume data

for the first quarter of the company's fiscal year (to end June). Ryanair has flown 21.28m pax in the quarter (+10pc 
underlying and over 18pc on a net basis due to last year's volcano), which is about 250k higher than our 
expectations," said Davy's Eamonn Hughes. Shares in Ryanair dipped 2c to E3.50.

The ISEQ fell sharply this morning amid fears that the latest downgrade for Portugal will spread the crisis and that 
Ireland could be next to have its sovereign debt rated "junk".
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 23.90 points to 2,979.16.
Ireland's credit rating may be cut to junk by Moody's Investors Service after Portugal yesterday lost its investment 
grade rating, analysts said today. Moody's, which slashed Portugal four notches yesterday to Ba2 from Baa1, in 
April lowered Ireland's credit rating to the lowest investment grade Baa3 and left country's outlook on negative. The 
ratings company cut Portugal's rating in part because the nation may not be able to return to debt markets in the 
second half of 2013. "While Ireland has thus far managed to maintain its investment grade status, contagion risks 
are highlighted by this latest ratings move from Moody's. Moody's currently has Ireland at Baa3 with a negative 
outlook, which is the lowest investment grade rating. While Fitch and S&P have the sovereign rated marginally 
higher at BBB+", said Goodbodys.
CRH has reported that it has spent E186m on 21 acquisitions / investments in the six months to June end, which 
compares to E367m on 14 deals in the second half of 2010 and E133m on 13 acquisitions in first half of last year. 
The announced deals should add incremental sales of c.E130m. In addition to the completed spend of E186m, 
CRH has agreed to acquire VVM Group, a materials business in Belgium but is subject to regulatory approval. 
Including VVM total acquisition spend increase to c. E300m. Shares in CRH fell 20c to E14.81. Packaging group, 
DS Smith announced that it has received an offer for its UK office wholesaling business, Spicers, valuing the 
business at £200m. "Since the new CEO arrived at DS Smith, the focus has been on developing the packaging 
business. Spicers' future within the company was always in doubt," said Davy. Shares in Smurfit Kappa fell 9c to

EasyJet June Passengers, Load Factor Rise - Update

(RTTNews) - Budget airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) Wednesday said it carried more passengers in the month of June, 
compared to the prior-year month, and its load factor rose 1.1 percentage points from last year.
The airline carried 4.95 million passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, in the month, up 9.1 
percent from last year's 4.54 million.
The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether the passenger turns up or not, as 
easyJet is a no-refund airline. Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for 
business travel.
Load factor, a capacity utilization measure which represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the 
number of seats available for passengers, improved to 88.3 percent in the month from 87.2 percent last year.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said its passengers grew 9 percent in June to 7.33 million, 
while load factor for the month stood flat at 84 percent.
In May, easyJet had reported a 11.3 percent increase in passengers to 4.74 million, while load factor declined 1.7 
percentage points from last year to 84.1 percent.
For the rolling 12 months ended June, passengers increased 12 percent to 53.36 million and load factor advanced 
0.4 percentage points to 87.1 percent from 86.7 percent.
EZJ.L closed Tuesday's regular trade at 366.60 pence, up 0.40 pence or 0.11 percent, on 433,197 shares.

If you plan to fly with a low-cost airline this summer, you will have discovered that the final bill was not so low cost 
after all. Additional charges, not just for baggage but for payment and even for checking in, have prompted a super 
complaint from the UK consumer organisation Which? and spurred the Office of Fair Trading into action.
And have you struggled to understand your mobile phone bill? Bought a cartridge of ink that costs almost as much 
as the printer? Do you fill in your personal details on an insurance comparison website every year, or just accept 
uncompetitive renewal terms? Have you used the internet or the minibar in a hotel, or watched the teaser offer on a 
mortgage revert to a standard variable rate?
Products are complex, and time is scarce. Consumers focus on a few headline prices and features when they make 
their choices and so competition is focused on those headline prices and features. Economics 101 teaches that 
markets work best when competition leads to prices in line with costs, but in markets like these, competition has the 
opposite effect. Producers do not necessarily make excessive profits overall because the prices of key features are 
forced down to uneconomic levels. No one can really give you a free mobile handset, or fly you to Bratislava for 
99p.
But the retailer with simple, honest pricing must seek to match these offers. If the winner of the competitive race is 
the company that is most innovative, not in productive efficiency or customer service, but in the ingenuity and 
opacity of its tariff structures, consumers will not be happy, or well served, in the long run. Ryanair is simultaneously 
popular and despised.
Almost everyone, consumers and producers, would benefit if these practices stopped, despite the feeble attempts 
of lawyers, public relations people and economists to justify them. These hired guns argue, often correctly, that 
consumers can, with sufficient diligence, obtain all the information they need. But most of us have better things to 
do than to engage in line-by-line scrutiny of our mobile phone bills, or undertake a discounted cash flow calculation 
of the lifetime cost of a £50 document printer. Thank goodness. Show me the person who has actually read the 
"important information" you must understand before entering the website of an institution rergulated by the Financial 
Services Authority, and I will show you a man who has difficulties with girls.
The $10 minibar beer is no basis for capitalism
Small regulatory and legal changes might help. A general principle that charges for making payments must be 
related to the transactions' actual costs would both end some abuses and stimulate use of the cost-effective debit 
card system. Many people thought the law prohibited penalties in consumer contracts - disproportionate charges for 
minor infractions, such as late payment of credit card bills - until the courts decided otherwise. Legislation could 
reverse that position. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein have usefully suggested that utility providers present bills 
in standardised machine readable form to facilitate price comparisons. In some cases, agreements between firms, 
brokered by the OFT and negotiated under the threat of extended regulatory investigation, might do the trick.
Many people may think the problem of the $10 minibar bottle of beer is unimportant in the context of financial crisis 
and global macroeconomic imbalances, or that the costs of a regulatory drive would exceed the likely benefits. I 
disagree. Encouraging bad decisions through teaser mortgage rates was a central contributory factor in the 
financial crisis. Business practices whose rationale derives from consumer ignorance and producer knowledge 
create a larger problem. When people see many examples of minor exploitation of consumers in their daily lives, 
they will conclude that extensive exploitation is characteristic of business as a whole. And they may be right. If 
caveat emptor is seen as a dominant business principle by both producers and consumers then the legitimacy of 
capitalism and market organisation will not long survive.

Investigators in the Netherlands have queried whether rejected take-off decision-making and procedures should be 
re-examined during an inquiry into a late aborted take-off by a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 at Eindhoven.
The take-off was rejected at 152kt (281km/h), beyond the 141kt V1 decision speed, with the aircraft already rotating 
and its nose-wheel having lifted from the runway 2s beforehand.
A Dutch Safety Board inquiry into the 4 June 2010 incident found the first officer, who was flying, had trouble 
keeping the aircraft on the runway centreline at low speed.
He interpreted the problem as engine thrust asymmetry but a cross-check by the captain revealed no difference in 
engine indications, with no such problem subsequently found on the flight-data recorder.
"The collected information shows that during the take-off roll the aircraft experienced an undetermined atmospheric 
disturbance," the inquiry reported. "The first officer felt and interpreted this disturbance as an unsafe condition to 
continue the take-off."
Despite the carrier's procedures giving only the captain authorisation to abort, the first officer rejected the take-off 
and the aircraft stopped about 500m from the end of the 3,000m runway.
"With the current state of technology and human factor theories available, a re-evaluation of the rejected take-off 
concept and procedures may be useful and warranted," said the Safety Board.
Last year a Dutch study found the "correctness" of abort decisions had "not increased" despite the introduction of 
the Take-off Safety Training Aid tool, intended to improve decision-making and cut rejections, in 1994.

Investigators in the Netherlands have queried whether rejected take-off decision-making and procedures should be 
re-examined during an inquiry into a late aborted take-off by a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 at Eindhoven.
The take-off was rejected at 152kt (281km/h), beyond the 141kt V1 decision speed, with the aircraft already rotating 
and its nose-wheel having lifted from the runway 2s beforehand.
A Dutch Safety Board inquiry into the 4 June 2010 incident found the first officer, who was flying, had trouble 
keeping the aircraft on the runway centreline at low speed.
He interpreted the problem as engine thrust asymmetry but a cross-check by the captain revealed no difference in 
engine indications, with no such problem subsequently found on the flight-data recorder.
"The collected information shows that during the take-off roll the aircraft experienced an undetermined atmospheric 
disturbance," the inquiry reported. "The first officer felt and interpreted this disturbance as an unsafe condition to 
continue the take-off."
Despite the carrier's procedures giving only the captain authorisation to abort, the first officer rejected the take-off 
and the aircraft stopped about 500m from the end of the 3,000m runway.
"With the current state of technology and human factor theories available, a re-evaluation of the rejected take-off 
concept and procedures may be useful and warranted," said the Safety Board.
Last year a Dutch study found the "correctness" of abort decisions had "not increased" despite the introduction of 
the Take-off Safety Training Aid tool, intended to improve decision-making and cut rejections, in 1994.

Highlight: Charges
OFT call to end debit card surcharges faces opposition, writes Elaine Moore
Body
Budget airlines look set to oppose an order to stop charging fees to customers who pay with a debit card.
This week, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) called for an end to the debit card surcharges imposed by travel 
companies, which are often added at the very last stage of a transaction.
It wants the cost of processing debit cards, estimated to be 20p per transaction, to be absorbed into the price of the 
ticket. Costs for using credit cards must also be made clear to shoppers from the start of a transaction, the OFT 
said.
Which? has identified 16 airlines that charge customers for paying with a debit card, including Europe's largest low-
cost airline, Ryanair.
Budget airlines were found to be adding up to £8 to the price of a single ticket for paying with a debit card - costs 
that were "dripped" into the final price only after customers had almost completed the purchase.
Some carriers have already decided to remove fees. Monarch Airlines scrapped its 3.5 per cent debit card charge in 
June.
But Ryanair, which charges £6 per flight, per person, for payment with a debit card, insisted that its charges were 
"optional". It argued that customers can avoid a charge if they use a pre-paid MasterCard - a not- widely-held 
payment card that comes with its own charges and a set-up fee.
Flybe, which charges a £5.50 debit card surcharge for a single flight, said that its charges were "clear and easily 
accessible from stage one of the booking process". Jet2, which charges a £4.99 flat rate, also claimed to be upfront 
about its nonoptional charges.
Airlines resist card fee ruling
BMIbaby, which levies a £4 charge for each person flying, even if payment is made on a single card, said that it was 
investigating the new ruling and that it would work with the OFT.
However, analysts have warned out that if debit card surcharges are banned, travel companies may seek to make 
up the cost in baggage fees or other supplements.

Body
When it comes to hidden charges, the airline industry could teach fund managers a thing or two (and would no 
doubt charge extra for the second thing, on an exponentially sliding scale based on size, weight and ability to be 
stowed in an overhead locker).
Take Ryanair, the amusingly self-styled "world's favourite airline". These are just some of its extra charges (if you 
think I'm making them up, visit www.ryanair.com/en/terms-and-conditions): priority boarding fee, £5 (ie, priority over 
the only three passengers who didn't pay the surcharge for this); reserved seating fee, £10 (only ensures avoidance 
of departure gate stampede on selected routes); checked baggage fee for first 15kg bag, £15 (costs £10 more if 
going on summer holiday and packing fewer clothes); name change fee, £100 (unclear if this covers deed poll, or 
just name on ticket); oxygen reservation fee, £100 (unclear if this applies to masks that should fall from cabin ceiling 
in event of emergency); fee for special declaration of valuable baggage, £100 (unclear if declaration is to tip wink to 
heavy-handed or light-fingered baggage handlers).
It was not surprising, then, that when the publicity-shy Irish airline suggested a £1 charge for using its on-board 
lavatories, most people thought it was serious. Whipped into a frenzy of indignation by the mid-market tabloids, 
passengers sought advice from Moneysavingexpert.com - conjuring up an image of the eponymous expert leading 
by example and squirming cross-legged all the way from Stansted to Bratislava (ie, 100 miles outside Bratislava) 
just to save a few quid.
It was, allegedly, a PR joke - but so ludicrous have "low-cost" airlines' surcharges become that stand-up comedians 
don't even bother using this material any more.
However, there is one set of hidden charges that were never funny in the first place: "administration fees" of up to 
£8 when buying a ticket with a debit card. So, following a "super complaint" from Which? magazine, the Office of 
Fair Trading (OFT) this week announced that it would seek a change in the law to prohibit surcharging for debit card 
payments . As Cavendish Elithorn, senior director at the OFT, put it: "People are frustrated about being asked to 
pay for paying."
Sky's the limit on hidden fund charges, too
Not even the fund management industry would try to get away with this kind of charging, would it? Well, as a 
campaigner against hidden investment charges, I was struck by similarities between the airlines' dubious practices 
and those of fund managers. Consider these aspects of the OFT complaint:
  Failure to disclose upfront charges in plain language. In its original complaint, Which? wanted airlines "to tell 
consumers upfront if they have surcharges and how much they are - this needs to be in plain language in their 
advertising and promotions." I still want fund managers to declare the total cost of investing upfront - at present they 
don't, because the not-exactly-plain-speaking "total expense ratio" isn't total.
  Charges disproportionate to provider's actual costs. Which? wanted its super-complaint to result in "fair charges - 
the costs to the consumer should be the same as the cost to the retailer . . . this shouldn't be a hidden way of 
making money." It calculated that the cost of processing a debit card payment was 20p, but airlines charge 40 times 
that amount. I want fund groups to stop charging investors a full 5 per cent if they pay their money directly to the 
manager - almost all still do this, taking more than £500 just for accepting a year's investment into an individual 
savings account (Isa). Assuming fund managers pay no more than airlines for processing debit card payments, their 
mark up is 2,500 times.
  Disclosure of full costs too late in the process. In its investigation, the OFT found "considerable evidence of 
companies using 'drip pricing' practices - adding payment charges to the total price only after consumers have filled 
in a number of web pages during their purchase." I would argue that the fund management industry is worse - 
disclosing total costs, including sharedealing and stamp duty, only in annual reports that investors receive after  
parting with their money.
In the airline industry, the OFT estimates that hidden charges cost consumers £300m a year. In the fund 
management industry, however, investors could be paying " up to £5.8bn a year in hidden charges ", claims Alan 
Miller of investment firm SCM Private.
My challenge, therefore, to the OFT and Which?, is this: having gone after the easy targets in the budget airline 
sector, turn your attention to financial services. After all, the OFT claims that companies can "improve the 
transparency and presentation of other surcharges . . . quickly and easily." As passengers booked on the Ryanair 
departure to Bratislava might ask: "What are we waiting for?"

Highlight: The bond is the first Euro-denominated US Ex-Im bond.
Body
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has priced and closed the first Euro-denominated US Ex-Im-guaranteed bond for 
(EURO)156 million ($222 million). The proceeds from the bond, which closed today, will refinance a portion of the 
purchase price for eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft that delivered in February and March this year.
Credit Agricole-CIB (CA-CIB) and Goldman Sachs were bookrunners.
The bond, issued by special purpose company King International Leasing II, priced at Euribor +70bps and has a 
floating rate. It priced on July 12 and matures on January 20 2023.
"It's a tremendous achievement because clearly having a bond in Euros means we can match our source of 
financing against our revenues, which is very important to us," says Howard Millar, chief financial officer, Ryanair. 
"From a business management perspective it's far easier to finance aircraft in the currency in which we generate 
the vast majority of our revenues."
Millar also says that the inaugural bond opens a new class of financing for Ryanair and other airlines. It also has the 
potential to be used for other assets such as rail or shipping.
"We see it as a new life for the Ex-Im product," Millar says.
Greg Lee, managing director, Goldman Sachs, says the banks have been working with Ex-Im since 2009 to do a 
non-US denominated transaction and with Ryanair since the beginning of the year.
The transaction was challenging for several reasons. On top of the macro-volatility with the uncertainty in European 
markets and concerns over the US debt ceiling, Ex-Im also had to be cautious with its own foreign currency 
exposure.
The banks also had to consider the distribution of the bond because a Euro-denominated bond that is backed by 
the US government does not have a natural buyer base.
"There's a natural buyer base for European government-guaranteed euro, and US government-guaranteed dollar-
but selling to a Euro-buyer base with a US government obligation is in between," Lee says.
Ryanair prices (EURO)156m Ex-Im bond
"We were fortunate that Ryanair is a great name to take to mkt. Investors didn't have to worry about pre-payment 
risk associated with underlying airline default." 
Ryanair closed its first US Ex-Im bond in November 2010 to finance 737-800 deliveries. CA-CIB and Goldman 
Sachs were also joint bookrunners and structuring agents for the deal. Read the story here.
Both banks also previously partnered to jointly arrange the first US dollar-denominated Ex-Im bond for Emirates and 
the first European export credit bond for AerCap.

Highlight: The Irish low cost carrier's net income was up 1% as fuel costs rose by 49%.
Body
Despite high fuel costs Ryanair's net income increased by 1% year-on-year to (EURO)139 million ($200 million) 
due to higher average fares and ancillary charges. Revenue was up 29% to (EURO)1.15 billion with a 18% rise in 
traffic. But a 49% rise in fuel costs forced unit costs up 14%.
At the Paris Air Show last month, Ryanair entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese aircraft 
manufacturer Comac to start negotiations for a 200 seater shorthaul aircraft which will be available in 2018. "We 
believe this aircraft will be a real alternative to the existing duopoly of Boeing and Airbus," says Michael O'Leary, 
CEO, Ryanair. 
"We believe that it will make economic sense for Ryanair to become a two aircraft operator if the present Boeing 
fleet economies can be matched or improved by another aircraft manufacturer," he says.
 
The Irish airline has firm orders with Boeing for 40 aircraft but has not been able to agree a price with the US 
manufacturer for an additional order.
Ryanair anticipates a decline in Dublin airport's traffic in 2011 because of a 40% rise in airport charges. It 
anticipates 4% traffic growth in FY12. 
During the first quarter the airline agreed sale/leasebacks for five aircraft.

Airline looks to Europe for growth
Body
Higher fuel costs, disruption from last year's Icelandic volcanic eruption and severe winter weather combined to 
push Flybe into the red just as the regional airline prepares to expand into continental Europe.
Flybe reported a pre-tax loss of £4.3m in its first full-year results since it raised £60m through its flotation last 
December, compared with a profit of £24.6m the previous year. The results were in line with expectations following 
a profit warning last month.
Investors focused on management's slightly more upbeat tone about current trading, with the shares closing up 9.5 
per cent, or 16p, at 184p.
Jim French, chief executive, conceded the shares were a long way off the 295p float price but said investors were 
looking at a long-term strategy of expanding into continental Europe through acquisition or joint ventures. He said a 
deal was close to being signed."There will be confirmation of something, I hope, in the very near future," he said.
Flybe wants to reduce its dependence on the UK, from which it derives 85 per cent of revenues. It estimated the 
volcanic ash cloud in April 2010 and bad weather cost it £18.1m. Excluding this, underlying profit was £22.3m in the 
12 months to the end of March, up from £7.4m. Earnings per share fell from 42p to 6p. Revenues rose 4.4 per cent 
to £595.5m.
Flybe will impose a fuel surcharge of £3 a passenger from September 1. Passenger numbers were steady at 7.2m 
but load factor, measuring how full aircraft are when they fly, fell 1.8 percentage points to 61.7 per cent.
  FT Comment 
The timing of the IPO could not have come at a worse time, just ahead of a big jump in fuel prices that hit airlines 
hard. The key to unlocking the growth potential of the stock is evidence from Flybe's experienced management 
Bad weather causes Flybe to nosedive into red
team that it can find the right deals in continental Europe to drive growth. Flybe has no listed peer group and it is a 
stretch to compare it with Ryanair and EasyJet. Even so, a forward p/e ratio of just over 7 looks harsh, based on 
expected earnings of 25p per share for the current year, when the two low-cost airlines are on multiples in the low 
teens. The compelling growth story may have gone from the darlings of the low-cost sector but that doesn't mean 
Flybe should shrug off the full discount.

Highlight: OFT targets budget airlines over fees
Body
Travel companies, including the largest budget airline in Europe, have been told to stop hiding surcharges for 
customers who pay with debit cards.
The cost of processing debit cards is estimated to be 20p a transaction, but companies have been found to add up 
to £8 to final bills for payment by a debit card.
The Office of Fair Trading has warned that retailers that levy artificially high fees for card payments, or do not 
advertise fees charged, face action under consumer protection laws.
It has also recommended a change in the law to limit charges to the cost of processing card payments.
In an investigation of consumer charges in the travel industry, the watchdog found that a number of companies 
used a "drip pricing" method to add costs only at the very end of transactions.
Budget airlines including Ryanair were picked out as particular offenders.
Ryanair charges customers who buy flights with a debit card a £6 administration fee per passenger, per flight.
This means that a return flight booked in a single transaction on one card incurs a £12 fee.
Ryanair, which reported a 23 per cent rise in net profit in the year to the end of March, said the charge was not a 
debit card fee but rather an "optional" administration fee.
Customers can avoid the charge if they have a prepaid MasterCard, which come with its own charges, including a 
set-up fee and monthly service charge.
Watchdog acts on debit card charges
As part of its "super complaint" into card charges in the travel industry, which preceded the OFT's investigation, 
consumer group Which? found that 16 airlines charged customers for using debit cards, including Ryanair, EasyJet, 
BMI Baby and Flybe.
Consumers in the UK are estimated to have spent £300m on surcharges in 2009 when buying travel tickets.
Following the publication of its findings the OFT said some companies had agreed to remove debit card charges, 
but travel analysts said they expected others to resist the change.
"If the card surcharge is banned the companies will seek to make up this lost revenue," said Bob Atkinson, travel 
analyst at Money-supermarket.com. "This could mean higher fees for credit card use or baggage allowances later 
on."
Monarch Airlines removed its 3.5 per cent debit card charge in June. The airline claimed it had not raised costs 
elsewhere but expected to benefit from better customer relations.
City lawyers said it was unlikely that consumers would see an end to debit card surcharges, but expected the OFT 
to enforce clarity in price advertising for travel companies.
The UK Cards Association, which represents credit and debit card providers, has supported the OFT investigation 
and agreed that some companies were imposing inflated surcharges beyond the actual card processing cost.

AIRLINES and travel companies were warned yesterday that they face punishment over their "hidden" credit and 
debit charges.
An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), found evidence of companies using "drip pricing" tactics - 
where surcharges are added to the full price only after consumers have filled in a number of web pages.
The OFT estimates that consumers spent £300m on payment surcharges during 2009 in the airline sector.
Its report showed that easyJet charges £8 per card transaction after customers pass through eight web pages while 
Ryanair adds £6 after four pages.
Ryanair has shrugged off the statement by the OFT, saying that it is "unaffected" and denied levying any credit card 
charges.

Comac extends Western front with Ryanair link
Partnership with Irish low-cost carrier and signing with CFM demonstrate Chinese manufacturer's serious intent
Comac cranked up its presence dramatically at this year's Paris air show, as the Chinese aerospace corporation 
seeks to be taken as a serious alternative to established Western airframers.
While Comac is frequently the star of the show at Chinese trade events such as Airshow China in Zhuhai, the 
corporation has traditionally kept a low profile at international gatherings.
This week in Paris, that all changed. Comac grabbed the headlines through the establishment of a partnership with 
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair to work together on the design of the Comac C919 narrowbody airliner. Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said he is in talks with Comac about acquiring a substantial number of C919s.
"We have started discussions on pricing... if we do order, there is no point for us to order just a few, it would be over 
200 aircraft," said O'Leary.
He expressed interest in a larger, 200-seat version of the C919. The baseline model can accommodate 168 seats 
in an all-economy configuration.
"We could start with 20 to 30 aircraft at the start. We could take the baseline version first, as long as a bigger 
version comes along," said O'Leary, who wants new aircraft deliveries to begin from 2017. Ryanair is approaching 
the end of deliveries from its current 737 order dating from 2009, with about 30 aircraft still to come.
Many have openly expressed cynicism towards the partnership, dismissing it as a publicity stunt or merely a way for 
Ryanair to force Boeing to offer a more competitive price. But O'Leary has indicated he is considering the C919 as 
a viable alternative to Boeing's 737 and dismisses criticism of the Chinese programme. He believes the aircraft will 
meet US and European safety standards, he said.
No Headline In Original
Away from the headline grabbing, Comac showed the technical progress it is making on the aircraft. It displayed a 
full-scale mock-up of the C919's cabin at the show and signed a number of deals with suppliers.
Notable among these was the official signing of the contract with engine-maker CFM International to provide its 
Leap-X1C powerplant for the type.
Comac's senior executives, including president Jin Zhuanglong and C919 chief designer Wu Guanghui, who 
previously rarely made public statements about the company outside China, gave updates on the C919 
programme.
Scheduled for first flight in 2014 and entry into service in 2016, the C919 programme will enter its manufacturing 
phase with first metal cut in December, said Wu.
Comac also aims to finalise all agreements with suppliers by August, he added.
Calling its presence at the show a "record", Comac executives indicated that its stance has changed about how it is 
represented in the international market. Staff have enrolled in English classes as they acknowledge the need to 
communicate with non-Chinese players in the industry.
As one executive put it: "Our main focus might be the Chinese, but we also want to have a share in the international 
market. And to do that, we must work with companies overseas and learn from them."

AirAsia has a chief executive straight from central casting. In the great tradition of airline entrepreneurs, Tony 
Fernandes has a gift for self-promotion: see his Twittered bid for West Ham United, the London football club, or the 
purchase of Caterham Cars. He also makes good copy. This week his company signed an $18bn, 15-year deal with 
Airbus to supply 200 A320 Neos - the third-largest order in the European company's history. "One and two are 
Emirates and Qatar," Mr Fernandes readily admitted. "But they don't count because they have oil and stuff."
Not much else about the 10-year-old company is conventional either. Since floating in November 2004 the shares 
of the Kuala Lumpur-based low-cost carrier, Asia's largest by passenger volumes, have outperformed the global 
aviation sector by 129 per cent. The core short-haul business has soared . A handful of global rivals has kept pace 
with AirAsia's revenue growth over the past five years, but none has bettered its average 57 per cent annual 
increase in net income.
And while some no-frills long-haul carriers (including Oasis, which flew from Hong Kong to London) have collapsed, 
AirAsia X, launched in 2007 and which serves 15 destinations from Paris to Seoul, has been a success. Last 
month, even venerable Singapore Airlines announced plans to launch a cheap long-haul service; the previous chief 
executive officer had said it would never work.
The stock, up almost a third this year, is now worth more than the flag carriers of each of its core markets of 
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Disappointment will surely come: in an industry with a long-run operating margin 
of just 2 per cent, it always does. But for now, as AirAsia puts together a fleet the size of Ryanair, Europe's biggest 
budget carrier, hang on.

Airbus streaks ahead of Boeing on Paris jet deals

Boeing executives tried to put on brave faces at the Paris Air Show this week after rival Airbus walked off with a 
record number of orders and commitments for new passenger jets.
The European aircraft maker's success was down almost entirely to its latest aircraft programme - the A320 Neo, 
an upgraded version of its best-selling A320 narrow-body aircraft.
Airbus booked 667 commitments in total for the re-engined aircraft, which will enter service in 2015, lifting its haul 
for the show to 730 aircraft, worth $72.2bn at list prices. In contrast, by Friday Boeing had announced deals for just 
68 of the 737, bringing its total to 111 jets, worth $17.1bn.
The success of the Neo - it has now secured more than 1,000 orders since its launch last year - has piled further 
pressure on Boeing to respond, with both incumbents admitting their duopoly is over as new entrants target the 
narrow-body market. Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft business based in Seattle, dismissed the 
Neo this week by arguing it was merely bringing the A320 up to the standard of the rival Boeing 737.
Tom Enders, his counterpart at Airbus, ridiculed the suggestion but the proof will come if Airbus manages to switch 
key Boeing customers to the Neo. The US group has said it will decide by early-2012 whether to upgrade the 737 
engine or build an all-new aircraft.
The threat from new entrants was hammered home on Tuesday when Ryanair, an exclusive Boeing 737 customer, 
signed a co-operation agreement with China's Comac to advise on the development of a larger version of the C919 
narrow-body, which should enter service in 2016.

The ISEQ rebounded from yesterday's rout this morning on hopes Greece could avoid a default after international 
agencies gave their go-ahead for a five-year austerity plan.
By 12:30, the index had gained 29.10 points to 2,903.32.
European shares bounced back on Friday from three-month closing lows with the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares up 1.2 percent at 1,088.55 after falling 1.5 percent in the previous session. The index could close 
higher this week after losses in the previous seven weeks. "This market is trading incremental news flow around 
Greece and sovereign issues quite hard and the agreement (between Greece and EU/IMF) has been received well 
by the markets," said Ian Richards, European equity strategist at RBS.
Irish GDP rose by 1.3pc in Q1 2011 following the 1.4pc decline in Q4 2010, upwardly revised from the 1.6pc fall in 
the previous national accounts release. This means that there was a marginal rise in real GDP on the year, with 
growth at 0.1pc in annual terms. The bounce back is even more pronounced in nominal terms. Nominal GDP rose 
by 5.1pc in the first quarter following a 5.9pc decline in Q4 2010. Shares in mining group Kenmare Resources rose 
3c to E0.64 after Iluka has reported that certain grades of ilmenite are currently priced around USD300 per tonne on 
the spot market in China against USD100-120 a tonne a year ago. Iluka is the world's second-largest titanium 
dioxide feedstock producer with some 15pc market share. Bank of Ireland has indicated the early bird take-up for its 
liability management exercise (LME) saw 72.4pc acceptances, with 95pc of these bondholders opting for the equity 
option, the balance for cash. Goodbody's had previously anticipated a reasonably high take-up of the equity offering 
in the LME, but are now nudging up the equity acceptance level in our model to 80-85pc (from about 75-80pc 
previously and implying a share count of 30bn). "In our view, the capital generated from the LME is likely to be 
approaching the E2.5bn level," the broker said. Shares in the bank were flat at E0.12. AIB slipped 1c to E0.16 and 
Irish Life and Permanent was unmoved at E0.07. The decision yesterday by the IEA to release oil stocks of 60m

barrels over 30 days drove oil prices down 6pc yesterday, below the dollar 110 level, which had acted as a floor for 
the last few months. Presently, Goodbody Stockbrokers' forecasts for Ryanair incorporate dollar 110 oil from FY12 
onwards, so yesterday's adjustment will have taken some pressure off our estimates given the move to as high as 
dollar 120 earlier in June. "However, an oil price sustainably below dollar 110 would be welcomed," it said. Shares 
in Ryanair rose 4c to E3.64. Aer Lingus stocks gained 2c to E0.72.

Highlight: Budget group eyes Chinese aircraft
Agreement puts pressure on Boeing
Body
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and one of Boeing's biggest 737 customers, has said the US group 
appears "confused" over what to do with its best-selling narrowbody jet in response to the decision by Airbus to 
upgrade the engine of the rival A320.
The two aircraft makers' dominance of the 100-200 seat segment , the biggest part of the commercial jet market, is 
coming to an end with at least three companies from China, Canada and Russia set to introduce rival offerings in 
the next five years.
That threat was hammered home on Tuesday when Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, signed a co-
operation agreement with China's Comac. Under the deal, Ryanair will advise on the development of a 200-seat 
version of the company's C919 aircraft, a 147-seat passenger jet, which is due to enter into service with Chinese 
airlines in 2016.
Speaking to the Financial Times after the ceremony in Paris, Mr O'Leary said that Boeing's indecision would result 
in airlines holding off from ordering any more 737s until it has clarified its position, which it has said it will do by 
early next year.
"Boeing would seem to be confused. They seem to be in trouble about whether to re-engine the 737 or redesign it 
altogether. Until they have made up their mind, I think airlines will be reluctant to commit to the 737," he said.
Mr O'Leary urged Boeing to go for a new aircraft to meet the challenge of Airbus's upgraded A320 engine, dubbed 
the Neo: "I don't think re-engining is sufficient response to the Neo programme." He said Ryanair would discuss an 
order for 200 aircraft with both Comac and Boeing and would buy Comac's bigger jet, which could be ready by 
2018, if it beat Boeing's offering on operating costs. The move would end Boeing's exclusive supply relationship 
with Ryanair, which operates one of the largest fleets of 737s with more than 300 aircraft.
Ryanair chief critical of 737 'confusion'
"If Comac can get the costs right, then we will certainly place a big order with them," he said. "We are now 
committed to Comac in the same way we are committed to Boeing."
He added that Ryanair would look to buy both Comac jets and an all-new Boeing aircraft to encourage competition 
between the two companies.
After growing rapidly for the last 15 years, Ryanair is putting the brakes on its expansion. Mr O'Leary said it was 
likely to place an order in 2014 or 2015.
Airbus's new A320 has proved a huge hit as it offers fuel savings of 15 per cent over the current model at a time 
when airlines are facing rising fuel costs.
The European aircraft maker announced deals for more than 100 A320s at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday, bringing 
the total number of commitments to 594 since it was launched at the end of last year.

The ISEQ rebounded past the 2,900 level this morning ahead of as investors awaited a vote of confidence in the 
Greek Parliament.
The index rose 27.43 points to 2,900.35.
The vote, due after market close, is seen as a step towards the passage of more spending cuts in exchange for 
foreign emergency loans. "The slight rotation into cyclicals (seen this morning) implies investors might be prepared 
to say that the threat of default has been discounted," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley. 
"But given the low volume, I don't think anybody is holding that position with a high degree of conviction." He said 
the ramifications for equity markets in the event of a Greek default on its debts were unknown, but the recent slide 
in equities reflected a partial attempt to discount the bad news.
Irish Q1 GDP data and annual revisions will be released on June 23rd. Past revisions to the Irish annual GDP 
growth rate have been as large as 3.0pp, positively and negatively, and have averaged 1.5pp. So it would not be 
too surprising if the -0.7pc GDP growth rate in Q4 was revised up to around 1pc or down to -2pc. Revisions to the 
Irish GDP growth rate have been roughly twice as large as those in other developed economies. Since the 
recession began, GDP growth has mainly been revised down but has been revised up in recent quarters, according 
to Davy's Conall MacCoille. Playtech has this morning announced that it has signed a deal with the California 
Online Poker Association (COPA) for the licensing of its poker software and IMS management system. In addition, 
Sciplay, Playtech's JV with Scientific Games, and COPA have signed an ancillary services contract in conjunction 
with Playtech, for a full suite of poker services including poker management, hosting, advisory services, customer 
support, internal marketing and all hardware. The deal will see a free play poker offering supplied by Playtech, 
launched this year by COPA, which allows them to ready themselves in advance of any market opening. Shares in

that will carry 200 passengers and rival the low-cost carrier's current fleet of Boeing 737s. The airline's chief 
executive, Michael O'Leary, said Ryanair will replace 200 aircraft over the next few years and that these will be both 
Boeing and the new Comac aircraft. "Ryanair is pleased to sign this MOU (memorandum of understanding) with 
COMAC, and to work closely with them to develop a 200 seat C919 aircraft. We are pleased that there is now a real 
alternative to Boeing and Airbus, and we are seriously interested in the development of a 200 seat variant of the 
C919 aircraft, and we look forward to its introduction into commercial service from 2018 onwards," said Mr O'Leary. 
Shares in Ryanair climbed 5c to E3.57 while Aer Lingus gained 1c to E0.71.

introduction into commercial service from 2018 onwards," said Mr O'Leary.
Ryanair broke off talks with Boeing over a new order last year and has been openly planning to consider another 
manufacturer if it expands further after 2013. Ryanair is keen to acquire an aircraft with up to 200 seats, compared 
with 189 in the Boeing 737 in order to boost profit margins per flight. "Ryanair will have a fleet of over 300 Boeing 
aircraft by 2013, and we remain in continuing discussions with both Boeing and now COMAC for a replacement

Ryanair today said it has signed a deal with China's Comac to design a plane that will carry 200 passengers and 
rival the low-cost carrier's current fleet of Boeing 737s.
The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said Ryanair will replace 200 aircraft over the next few years and that 
these will be both Boeing and the new Comac aircraft.
"Ryanair is pleased to sign this MOU (memorandum of understanding) with COMAC, and to work closely with them 
to develop a 200 seat C919 aircraft. We are pleased that there is now a real alternative to Boeing and Airbus, and 
we are seriously interested in the development of a 200 seat variant of the C919 aircraft, and we look forward to its 
introduction into commercial service from 2018 onwards," said Mr O'Leary.
Ryanair broke off talks with Boeing over a new order last year and has been openly planning to consider another 
manufacturer if it expands further after 2013. Ryanair is keen to acquire an aircraft with up to 200 seats, compared 
with 189 in the Boeing 737 in order to boost profit margins per flight. "Ryanair will have a fleet of over 300 Boeing 
aircraft by 2013, and we remain in continuing discussions with both Boeing and now COMAC for a replacement 
aircraft order of at least 200 aircraft. Ryanair can become a two aircraft operator carrier, as long as the economies 
achieved by our current Boeing 737-800 fleet can be matched or lowered by a similar sized order from a different

The ISEQ rebounded past the 2,900 level this morning ahead of as investors awaited a vote of confidence in the 
Greek Parliament.
The index rose 27.43 points to 2,900.35.
The vote, due after market close, is seen as a step towards the passage of more spending cuts in exchange for 
foreign emergency loans. "The slight rotation into cyclicals (seen this morning) implies investors might be prepared 
to say that the threat of default has been discounted," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at Charles Stanley. 
"But given the low volume, I don't think anybody is holding that position with a high degree of conviction." He said 
the ramifications for equity markets in the event of a Greek default on its debts were unknown, but the recent slide 
in equities reflected a partial attempt to discount the bad news.
Irish Q1 GDP data and annual revisions will be released on June 23rd. Past revisions to the Irish annual GDP 
growth rate have been as large as 3.0pp, positively and negatively, and have averaged 1.5pp. So it would not be 
too surprising if the -0.7pc GDP growth rate in Q4 was revised up to around 1pc or down to -2pc. Revisions to the 
Irish GDP growth rate have been roughly twice as large as those in other developed economies. Since the 
recession began, GDP growth has mainly been revised down but has been revised up in recent quarters, according 
to Davy's Conall MacCoille. Playtech has this morning announced that it has signed a deal with the California 
Online Poker Association (COPA) for the licensing of its poker software and IMS management system. In addition, 
Sciplay, Playtech's JV with Scientific Games, and COPA have signed an ancillary services contract in conjunction 
with Playtech, for a full suite of poker services including poker management, hosting, advisory services, customer 
support, internal marketing and all hardware. The deal will see a free play poker offering supplied by Playtech, 
launched this year by COPA, which allows them to ready themselves in advance of any market opening. Shares in

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Tuesday said it has signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding in Paris, with the Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, Ltd. or COMAC, to participate 
in talks on the development of COMAC C919 aircraft for Ryanair.
The C919 aircraft will be designed to carry up to 200 passengers and should be available from 2018 onwards, 
Ryanair noted.
The COMAC is a state-owned company headquartered in Shanghai. It functions as the main vehicle in 
implementing large passenger aircraft programs in China.
Ryanair said it will assist COMAC to develop the new commercial aircraft, by sharing its experience and expertise. 
The new C919 aircraft, with up to 200 seats, is expected to enable Ryanair to lower costs and continue to lower 
fares for its passengers across Europe.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement in Paris, where the international Air Show is underway, 
"We are pleased that there is now a real alternative to Boeing and Airbus, and we are seriously interested in the 
development of a 200 seat variant of the C919 aircraft, and we look forward to its introduction into commercial 
service from 2018 onwards."
Ryanair stated that today's announcement will not affect its long standing relationship with Boeing Co. (BA). The 
company said it will have a fleet of over 300 Boeing aircraft by 2013 and said it remains in continuing discussions 
with both Boeing and COMAC for a replacement aircraft order of at least 200 aircraft.
RYA.L is currently trading at 3.56 pence, up 1.62 percent, on a volume of 1.49 million shares on the LSE.
RYAAY closed Monday's regular trading at $29.55 on the Nasdaq.

The survey by Amarach Research reveals that 30pc of Germans have a positive view of Irish products, so Irish 
goods should be clearly branded as "Made in Ireland", differentiating them from goods from Great Britain and the 
US which are not as favourably received by Germans.
This compares to just 16pc of German who positively view British products and 11pc US products. Kerry Gold, 
Baileys and Guinness are the top three most popular Irish Brands in Germany, with three out of four people having 
heard of these products. 60pc have at some stage used Kerry Gold, 55pc Baileys and 34pc Guinness. Ryanair is 
the fourth most popular Irish brand with almost half, 48pc, of Germans having heard of the airline and 12pc having 
used the low cost airline. The survey is good news for Irish exporters showing that the so-called bailout has not 
affected the German people's perceptions of Ireland. It also emphasises the fact that Irish businesses can sell into a 
market the size of Germany with no exchange rate risk - something that has never been fully exploited. One 
thousand German consumers aged over 16 were surveyed by Amarach Research in an effort to help identify 
opportunities for Irish brands and businesses targeting the most successful economy in Europe. It will be presented 
at a seminar jointly run by Amarach Research and Enterprise Ireland in Dublin on Wednesday, June 22nd. A key 
insight from the survey is that German consumers are willing and able to interact online with businesses that deliver 
real value, meaning Irish businesses can now use cheaper, more direct channels to build awareness about their 
business as well as sell directly.

High tech start-ups need to focus more on their strategy and their customers, and not just on their technology, in 
order to successfully break out, according to Thomas Lawton, one of Europe's leading business school academics.
Lawton said that many entrepreneurs spent too much time focussed on the technology they were developing and, 
while they thought that they had their customers' needs in mind, they were often too internally focused.
''I think that is an issue with not just Irish entrepreneurs or even just entrepreneurs," he said. ''People in business 
often think they know what the customer is looking for but they are actually transmitting their own views. 
Furthermore, if you are a technology led company you are more inclined to do it than a services company."
Lawton, an Irishman, is professor of strategy and international business at EMLYON Business School in France, 
and is also a visiting professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth in the US.
He was visiting Dublin this week to deliver the annual InterTradeIreland Innovation Lecture in UCD, and to host a 
series of innovation master classes at Nova UCD for SME owners and early-stage entrepreneurs. ''Innovation is not 
just technology based or product-led," he said.
''You can also have innovation on customer service, organisational culture, or on how you reduce costs. It goes 
right across the strategic process rather than just technology." Lawton said that businesses even at a very early 
stage need to start thinking strategically.
He said that entrepreneurs, especially those who haven't come through formal business training, often believe that 
strategic planning is for big firms who have planning resources behind them. However, there was a fairly 
straightforward list of areas that any business owner should focus on to formulate a strategy.
The first step any business owner should be thinking of is their route to breakout, he said.
Strategy holds the key
To achieve this there are several different models that could be followed. One is taking a market by storm. ''That 
could be a technology-led company that is a true original, which has a unique product," he said.
''The other is the revolutionary, where they lead with service or price innovations."
Another breakout strategy was what Lawton referred to as the ''laggard to leader'' strategy that is undertaken by an 
under-performing or even failing company. ''One way to do this is to be a wave rider, who adopts or adapts a 
business model from somewhere else," he said.
''That can be from another industry or another geographical location.
The classic case is probably Ryanair bringing the South West Airlines model to Europe, and adapting it to the 
regulatory framework here.
The second type is the big improver who focuses on efficiency and effectiveness, combined with getting as close to 
the customer as possible." Internationalisation was also a possibility for achieving a breakout. Lawton said that 
firms could expand on the basis of having something that people want, whether it be a product, a brand or a 
reputation.
That can be achieved either through organic growth or through a strategic alliance.
''The other way to go international is to be a conquistador," he said.
''That means acquiring companies in other markets.
Effectively, you are internationalising by process, because you have a superior way of doing business.
Your business model allows you to turn around failing businesses. Some examples in Ireland would be Glanbia or 
CRH."
The final strategy was shape-shifting, namely a company changing itself beyond all recognition in response to 
changing markets.
''IBM is the classic example, when they abandoned hardware and moved to services, or even Nokia over the course 
of its history. You have to do that over time. The best example of a firm that failed was Vivendi, which did it too 
quickly and didn't build up the expertise it needed."
Once a breakout strategy has been decided on, Lawton advised start-ups to then focus on their vision for the 
company.
That included where they wanted to go, and what kind of company they want to be when they get there. ''That isn't 
just reflecting on your objectives, such as market share, but also on what kind of identity you want to have, your 
reputation," he said.
Firms then have to decide what their value proposition is. They need to have a clear idea what is going to make 
them distinctive in a competitive market.
To do that, managers need to ask themselves why a customer would choose their products rather than a 
competitor's.
''There are six pillars to a value proposition: price, features, quality, support, availability and reputation," Lawton 
said.
''The alignment of those six variables is something you really need to think about and that needs to be done relative 
to the alternatives that the customer has, which is a competitor or a substitute product. You need to think from the 
customer's perspective rather than your own."
Strategy holds the key
I t is only at this point that Lawton believes entrepreneurs should focus on their business model, which he termed as 
simply a vehicle for delivering a value proposition. ''You need to synchronise market perception with corporate 
reality," he said. ''By doing all that, you can create a magnet company.
You are exciting markets, attracting and retaining customers, repelling new entrants, and rendering your 
competitors unable to respond.
''The final element of any strategy simply around implementation. When you are delivering all of these and putting 
your tactics into play, it is essential to keep a balance between the technological and the sociological system.
''Managers are very comfortable with processes and IT enabled activities. You can touch and understand them.
While you are doing that, you need to emphasise culture, team work, productivity levels, motivation and all the rest 
of it, which is less tangible, but just as important."

Government prepared to sell large stake in BoI

The government is prepared to give a commitment to sell a significant amount of its shareholding in Bank of Ireland 
to private investors, following a rights issue to investors.
The bank is understood to be in advanced discussions with a number of US private equity investors interested in 
taking a significant stake, with the talks believed to have advanced significantly over the past week.
The bank, led by chief executive Richie Boucher, is understood to held talks with a number of private equity groups, 
including Texas Pacific Group, run by Ryanair backer and chairman David Bondermann.
No deal has yet been finalised and sources say that the market mood and the fallout from the Greek crisis will be 
vital, ahead of the planned rights issue in early July, for which the formal prospectus was issued over the weekend 
to investors.
The key issue for any private equity investor is to be sure that it can get a significant stake in the bank.
For this reason, the government is preparing to put aside a significant chunk of its share entitlements, potentially 
entering a deal before the rights issue to sell on a minimum amount to these investors.
The bank announced yesterday that the state, through the National Pension Reserve Fund, was taking an option to 
buy another 15 per cent of its shares ahead of the planned rights issue, in addition to its current holding of 36 per 
cent.
This is to increase its flexibility to set aside a significant amount of shares for new investors, while also retaining a 
significant state holding in the bank in the long term.
New private investment would also lower the cost to the state of recapitalising the bank.
Government prepared to sell large stake in BoI
As it will underwrite the issue - committing to take up any shares not bought by investors - the state stake will be 
significantly higher i f new investors are not attracted to invest.
Detailed talks are understood to have taken place, coordinated by the bank, but the key issue now will be getting a 
final commitment to invest from the private equity groups. The deal could potentially leave a significant 
shareholding, perhaps 30 per cent or so, with one - or possibly two - private equity houses.
The bank is likely to seek to raise over  2 billion from the rights issue, in addition to significant savings on a similar 
scale from a debt buy back now underway.
Together with extra capital due from the state under the EU/IMF plan, this could see the bank reach its  5.2 billion 
target.
Private equity investors are believed to be generally confident that the Irish banks now have adequate capital on 
their balance sheets.
However the funding pressures remain a key issue, with Bank of Ireland - like all Irish banks - hugely reliant on the 
ECB and the Central Bank for funding.
This is understood to have been a central issue in the talks and one possibility is for a private equity investor to also 
bring some funding support to the bank, through a link up with an international bank or using its own resources.

From Mr Jeffrey Gazzard.
Sir, The Oliver Twist-like plea (Letters, June 14) from Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus of the Association of European 
Airlines for yet more subsidies to his member airlines, in the form of his demand that governments' aviation 
emission trading scheme income should be handed straight back to airlines for climate mitigation measures, falls 
apart when the example he quotes, high-performance winglets for his members' 1400 Airbus A320 aircraft, is 
examined more closely.
A pair of such winglets, as already seen, factory-fitted, on Ryanair's 737-800 fleet - by the way, not an AEA member 
airline - cost around $1.5m to purchase and install. They have an immediate impact on reducing fuel burn, 
extending range and improving climb rates - the fuel savings claimed are in the 2-3 per cent range. This is a 
relatively low-cost investment for airlines with a remarkably quick return on capital expenditure, often under 18-24 
months in most cases. All AEA member airlines should be retro-fitting such winglets to all their Airbus A320 aircraft 
at their next service anyway. It is laughable that ETS revenue should even be considered for something airlines 
should be doing as a matter of course.
And the contention that airlines would be profitless if they pay (or had paid) the cost of carbon under the European 
Union's ETS regime, conveniently ignores the reality that this small cost per trip will, of course, be passed on 100 
per cent to the passenger, with frankly little or no impact on demand or profit. But then a headline figure of a 
EUR1.1bn tax grab looks so much better, doesn't it, whereas in reality it is the fair and equitable embodiment of the 
"polluter pays principle" for a few euros per flight. That's why the AEA doesn't like it.
And as for a global scheme - why isn't the AEA simply campaigning for the EU ETS as the worldwide model if it 
wants to help save the planet so badly?

SHARES in car hire firm Avis Europe leaped 58 per cent yesterday as investors rushed to benefit from its takeover 
by US counterpart Avis Budget.
Avis Budget said it would pay £636m in cash for Avis Europe to reunite the two firms after 25 years and create a 
group with revenues of $7bn (£4.3bn).
The 315p per share offer was at a 60 per cent premium to Avis Europe's share price at Monday's close - but its 
shares gained 114.2p in trading yesterday to end at 310.8p.
The deal will give Avis a presence in 150 countries and operations in high growth markets including India and 
China. It should also bring cost synergies worth $30m or more per year.
"The car rental market is more and more consolidated worldwide, it is quite a capital intensive market," said Avis 
Europe chief executive Pascal Bazin.
"It is natural at one point in time to reunite two companies which are running the same brand in different territories."
The two companies have been separate since 1986, but Avis Budget has owned a stake in Avis Europe since 1989 
and floated it in London in 1997. Avis Europe's largest shareholder, Belgian group D'Ieteren with a 60 per cent 
stake, has backed the deal.
Avis Budget will fund the deal by raising equity of up to $250m, its own resources and a debt facility.
ADVISERS: CITI AND MORGAN STANLEY AVIS Budget has hired Citi and Morgan Stanley as joint advisers on 
the deal, while Barclays Capital is advising Avis Europe.
Shares in Avis spike on news of takeover SERVICES
Citi's team is headed by Philip Robert-Tissot, a service sector expert with experience working on complex and 
difficult deals including Kraft's takeover of Cadbury last year, and Simon Property Group's spat with its bid target 
Capital Shopping Centres.
Other notable deals he has advised on include Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial's takeover of airports operator 
BAA in 2006.
A Citi managing director, he has previously headed the bank's UK M&A division and is now its head of UK banking 
and broking. He has worked with Grant Kernaghan to seal the Avis takeover.
At Morgan Stanley, Adrian Doyle leads the advisory team. With 12 years' experience in the bank's M&A advisory 
team, Doyle advised budget airline Ryanair throughout its bid for Irish airline Aer Lingus, among other clients.

Ryanair today warned about an email scam from individuals purporting to be from the airline and looking for cash

The email scam tries to dupe people into paying for visa applications in order to apply for a job with Ryanair.
Ryanair will require up to 1,500 additional pilots and cabin crew this year around Europe and the majority of these 
jobs will be filled by those who train with one of the airline's approved recruitment partners.
It advises anyone who receives the email to delete it. It said the authorities in Ireland and the UK have been 
notified. "Ryanair condemns these illegal recruitment scams which prey on eager job hunters who are keen to 
secure a well paid career in aviation. Ryanair has contacted the authorities in the UK and Ireland to ensure that 
people are not duped into paying money for non-existent visas to unscrupulous scam artists. Those interested in a

notified. "Ryanair condemns these illegal recruitment scams which prey on eager job hunters who are keen to 
secure a well paid career in aviation. Ryanair has contacted the authorities in the UK and Ireland to ensure that 
people are not duped into paying money for non-existent visas to unscrupulous scam artists. Those interested in a 
career with Ryanair should ignore these email scams and only apply for vacancies listed on the Ryanair website, 
where they will also find information on our approved training partners," said Stephen McNamara.

Change or die, the maxim exhorts, and without realising it, we obey.
We grow up, we marry and we reproduce, we settle down and, bit by bit, we become different people.
We get comfortable, we run to fat, we go grey. We still see our friends occasionally, but we start our own families, 
so those intense friendships that we forged when we were young become less gut-wrenchingly urgent.
As that great American, Hunter S Thompson, once wrote (before his brains turned to mush):' 'You can't wallow with 
the eagles at night, then fly with the pigs in the morning."
Not that our families are pigs, but the mundane, day-to-day stuff inevitably takes over.
Work, Tesco, home; work, Tesco, home. Repeat until retirement.
Except that we all have a friend, don't we, who never seems to change at all. A Peter Pan figure who still lives the 
life.
I have such a friend - I'll call Him John. I could take a postcard John sent me in 1984, put it beside one he sent me 
last week and, apart from the postmark, you couldn't tell the difference.
John communicates by postcard; he's totally pre-digital.
His cards arrive every three months or so, from all over Europe. I know Europe pretty well, but a bit like the old 
Heineken advert, John reaches the parts that others can't.
Some of the places he writes from I've barely heard of since communism collapsed.
And I live in awe of anyone who can function east of Venice, where the Cyrillic alphabet starts replacing the Roman 
one, and where the locals' grasp of either English or French can no longer be taken for granted.
Dissent of man
John's postcards go a bit like this: beer, good times, madness, collapse, disappear for awhile.
Then he moves to another country and starts the process again. Then again.
He keeps moving; if he comes to water, John takes a plane and if he can't take a plane, he hires a speedboat.
He must have clocked up more miles than Ryanair's entire fleet, because his wanderlust long predates cheap air 
travel. Over the years he has managed to manufacture a job that suits his way of life.
He'll never be rich, but then again neither will I, and these days visiting Cork is like exotic foreign travel for me.
Every so often, John meets a woman. For the rest of us, meeting a woman has rooted us to a single spot.
John's the opposite; he falls madly in love all right, but when he does, if anything his movements become even 
more frantic. It's Tuesday, so it must be Belgrade. Beerfest in Berlin?
He's there, postcard to prove it. He's a new sort of citizen, is John.
Nowhere is home, yet he's at home everywhere. And depending on my mood, his postcards amuse me, evoke a 
strange sort of pity or make me insanely jealous.
Jealous, because on days when I'm driving to work in the rain, where the usual river of pointless paperwork awaits 
me, it sometimes seems as if John has everything figured out.
All the tedious stuff that we sneered at when we were young, and here I am, fecking bogged down in it.
At such times, I'm tempted to max out a credit card just to share John's never-ending journey for a fortnight or so. 
It's Monday, so it must be Montenegro.
At other times, I remind myself how incredibly lucky I am to have a family around me, and how coldly impersonal 
total freedom can be.
Freedom to roam, freedom to keep the party going . . .but who really cares, and what will you do when the novelty 
is gone? Start searching for new people and new places?
But mostly, when I get one of John's postcards, I just smile. Some people never change and, in away, I find that 
deeply reassuring.

It's one thing to have an innovative idea that could benefit society, and quite another to take that idea and actually 
make it happen. But that's just what is required if Ireland is to effectively tackle the many social issues that face it, 
according to Social Entrepreneurs Ireland (SEI).
The company runs an annual awards scheme to find people with new ideas for ways to tackle social issues, and 
provides them with the cash and support to drive them forward.
And, not surprisingly, in these recessionary times it has seen a big increase in applications. SEI has just announced 
the eight finalists for this year's scheme.
They have been chosen out of a total of 200 applicants, and each of them will receive around  25,000 to help them 
develop their potential.
Later this year, a final three will be selected to receive full backing and access to development funds worth over  
500,000, as well as mentoring and advisory services to help with issues such as strategy development, 
communications, financial planning and HR.
According to Sean Coughlan, chief executive of SEI, social entrepreneurs aren't all that different to conventional 
entrepreneurs.
''A social entrepreneur is someone who has an innovative idea who can help solve some of the challenges we face 
in this country," he says.
''Their approach, attitudes and motivations are very similar to the conventional entrepreneur, but instead of being 
driven by profit, they're driven to make a difference to the society they live in. The outcomes are different, but the 
process is the same."
Taking a risk for change
SEI was created by Sean Coughlan and Declan Ryan, son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, in 2004 with the purpose 
of sourcing and providing funding for individuals who might otherwise find it difficult to access capital.
The root of the idea behind the company is that while new ideas are required to solve the problems facing society, 
it's often very difficult for people in this sector to get any kind of support to test them out.
''The problem is that funding and capital are very risk-averse.
People tend to put money into charitable foundations that have been around for a long time, and that's good, of 
course. But it means that if you have a new idea, if you're trying to do something different, you're going to find it 
very hard," says Coughlan.
''Even in the good times, when the country was relatively wealthy and in good shape, we didn't make a lot of 
progress in a number of the key social issues that face the country.
We saw increasing problems around integration and racism, increases in relative poverty in certain sections of 
society, and problems with substance abuse.
All of these issues have been around for many, many years and yet we haven't made much of a difference, so 
obviously doing business as normal hasn't worked in this area."
SEI's key role is that of an early stage funder. ''We're prepared to take a bit of a risk on some ideas," says 
Coughlan. ''We know that not all of them will succeed, but the ones that do will drive substantial change."
Coughlan spent many years working in the IT sector, mentoring start-ups and guiding them from conception to 
launch, while also working in the voluntary work sector in his spare time.
A meeting with Declan Ryan, who is the chairman of SEI, provided the catalyst for the setting up of the 
organisation.
''In 2004, I started talking to Declan about social entrepreneurship and in particular about how we could take my 
expertise from the IT sector and apply that in a new way," says Coughlan.
Since 2005, SEI has invested almost  3.7 million in 142 social enterprises which have provided direct help to 
170,000 people.
The company receives no state funding and raises all its cash itself, a fact which Coughlan thinks keep the whole 
enterprise honest.
''Our money comes from business entrepreneurs and corporates.
We feel that if we're asking social entrepreneurs to go out and prove their model, then we should exercise the same 
discipline in our own organisation," he says.
''We go out and talk to high net worth individuals, successful business entrepreneurs and large companies who are 
entrepreneurial in their approach to business, and effectively what we say to them is 'guys, you understand how this 
works - it's the same mechanism applied to a different end'.
Usually they get it straight away." SEI decides which companies to support based on two simple criteria - quality of 
idea, and strength of personality.
''Firstly, we need to see an idea with potential, with a new way to look at a problem, and we need to see a pilot 
scheme or some kind of proof of concept to show that it's not just a pipe dream," says Coughlan.
''The second and equally critical element for us is the person behind the idea. Are they entrepreneurial?
There are a lot of ideas that never get anywhere because the personality of the person isn't right.
Taking a risk for change
We need the right people to drive the right ideas."

Irish shares fell for the fourth straight day today with sentiment hit by a bearish assessment of the U.S. economy by 
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and by the continuing eurozone debt crisis.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 11.44 points to 2,913.32.
Across Europe, the latest losing streak has knocked almost 4.4pc off the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, as 
a string of disappointing data from the world's largest economy, including weak labour and manufacturing figures, 
raised fears that the pace of recovery may be slowing. "The question marks regarding the growth dynamics for the 
global economy are becoming bigger and this is weighing on the markets," said Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist 
at UniCredit. "If we put this in perspective, the Euro STOXX could move towards the region of 2,650 or 2,700 
points, which is the lower end of the valuation that we have seen over the last two years," he said, adding that 
whether these levels could attract buyers depended on the extend of economic slowdown and deterioration of the 
euro zone debt crisis.
Back home, Aer Lingus has reported an increase in passenger numbers in May compared with the same month last 
year, though the figures were distorted by last year's disruption to flights caused by volcanic ash. The airline carried 
911,000 passengers last month, up 4pc on May 2010. Short-haul numbers rose 4.4pc, while long-haul figures were 
flat. Shares in the former flag-carrier fell 1c to E0.79. Ryanair's stocks dropped 5c to E3.57. NCI Building Systems 
(NCI), a US building products manufacturer with an insulated panels operation, reported results for the quarter to 
May 1st (its Q2). The results were announced after the close of business in the US. The group has a market 
capitalisation of circa dollar 200m. Ireland's Kingspan saw its shares stay unmoved at E7.00.

This morning's drop track falls across Europe as markets react negatively to a downbeat speech by US Fed 
chairman Ben Bernanke in which he failed to hint at any further economic stimuli.
The ISEQ index was 9.46 points lower a short time ago at 2,915.30.
Big names on the slide included CRH, down by 10c to 1435, Ryanair off by 5c to 357, and Smurfit Kappa 4c lower 
at 830. Bakery group Aryzta has dropped by 15c to 3730 and Irish Continental is also down 15c to 1620. Elan has 
bucked the trend with a gain of 16c to 684.

Body
The ISEQ fell again today as shares in Irish-Swiss food firm, Aryzta, fell nearly 3pc.
The index dropped 15.74 points to 2,924.76.
Aryzta's shares fell E1.05 to E37.45 as investors digested its latest set of results for the first half and despite 
brokers saying it is well on the road to meeting its full year 2011 forecasts.
Shares in Origin Enterprises fell 2c to E3.91 after it said agri-services revenue for the three months - its third 
financial quarter - rose 4.3pc from a year earlier to E370.3m. The performance was boosted by the acquisition of 
UK-based United Agri Products in March. Origin also said a marked recovery in the farming sector has led to 
stronger demand for its products. Revenue for the first nine months is 15pc ahead at E939.3m. US official data 
shows that the value of construction work put in place on US transportation projects fell 12.9pc year-on-year (yoy) 
in April. The single largest segment, highway and street construction, fell 9.5pc yoy. Shares in CRH fell 5c to 
E14.43. Aer Lingus has avoided a strike, with the industrial action stood down by pilots until July 1st to allow time to 
implement agreed proposals on the summer roster including buying back leave deals and moving to a '5 on 3 off' 
roster system from next winter. There will also be an agreement with Belfast and Gatwick pilots, details of which 
have not been released until balloted. Shares in the airline dipped 1c to E0.80 while Ryanair fell 3c to E3.61. 
Ryanair is now scheduled to deliver just 4pc growth by cutting winter capacity by 4pc (summer will be +10pc) due to 
the elevated oil price (Q4 per barrel cost up 31pc). The non-recurrence of the Icelandic volcano delivers about 2 
percentage points of growth, so underlying capacity growth is almost flat. Bank of Ireland has announced the bulk of 
its rights issue details. The rights issue is E4.35bn less capital raised under the liability management. Based on 
either accepting cash or shares, the maximum size will be E1.76bn if bondholders all chose equity and E2.22bn if 
bondholders all accept cash. "The rights will be priced at 10c and we estimate the TERP at 10.8c based on the 
share price as of right now (14.3c). Contingent Capital of E1bn is to be placed with the State, 5 year Tier 2 
subordinated instrument, with 10pc coupon and 8.25pc Core Tier 1 trigger. The conversion price is the higher of 30

day VWAP at date of conversion or 5c," said Goodbody Stockbrokers' analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Shares in the bank 
fell 1c to E0.14, Irish Life and Permanent was unmoved at E0.10 and AIB dipped 1c to E0.18. The Central Bank has 
submitted proposals on how the E600m Quinn Insurance Levy will be implemented, but the ultimate decision will be 
taken by the Finance Minister. As previously reported, the scheme will levy on policies (a 2-3pc levy) either sold 
within the Irish market, or alternatively levied on all policies sold by Irish based companies (including in the 
international market, which accounts for about two-thirds of all policies sold here). Shares in FBD gained 10c to

The ISEQ fell again this morning as shares in Irish-Swiss food firm, Aryzta, fell nearly 2pc.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 20.93 points to 2,919.57.
Aryzta's shares fell as investors digested its latest set of results for the first half and despite brokers saying it is well 
on the road to meeting its full year 2011 forecasts. Underlying revenue growth at Aryzta's food division in Q3 (13 
weeks ended April) rose by 5pc. At the H1 stage, underlying growth was 0.4pc, so growth has accelerated very 
significantly, according to Davy's John O'Reilly. Underlying growth comprises volume and price. "The Q3 revenue 
data are not disaggregated between these variables. While price (to recover raw material cost rises) will have 
played a significant part in the revenue rise, the tenor of the statement suggests that volume growth (in quick 
service restaurant (qsr) and in wider food service) was also achieved. The earnings guidance given at the H1 stage 
still appears reasonable, according to the statement." Shares in the group fell 75c to E37.75.

From Mr Adam Twidell.
Sir, Roy Peires leads a growing number of private jet customers who are demanding greater transparency from the 
private jet industry (" NetJets Europe's shares policy under attack ", June 1).
The recession has changed the landscape of private aviation; customers emerging into the new economic 
conditions are expecting the same terms as scheduled airline passengers. Industry practices are becoming more 
aligned, such as the recent UK budget announcement to introduce air passenger duty on private jet flights.
I am sure Mr Peires would accept paying NetJets a change fee to transfer the ownership of his flight hours. Surely if 
Ryanair can offer this service, NetJets can too.
NetJets is a world leader in private aviation and its product has raised the standards across the globe. NetJets now 
has an opportunity to champion the industry again, in terms of delivering the trading transparency that customers

Airport charges to be slashed
Airport charges to be slashed

A move to cut airport terminal charges by up to 40 per cent over the next four years has been welcomed by 
transport minister Leo Varadkar, as discussions continue on government proposals to abolish the travel tax in return 
for airlines increasing passenger numbers.
Varadkar described the lowering of the price cap imposed by the Irish Aviation Authority as another incentive to 
airlines to increase routes and bring more visitors to Ireland.
He said it followed the proposals in the government's jobs initiative to provide rebates on passenger charges and 
the abolition of the travel tax.
Ryanair declined to comment on the lower terminal charges on the basis that the company is in discussions with the 
Department of Transport to increase passengers by five million.
The current  202 terminal charge levied on each flight by the Irish Aviation Authority will be cut, starting with a 28 
per cent reduction in 2012, and followed by further annual reductions of about 5 per cent to the end of 2015.
The terminal charge is separate from DAA's passenger charges, which are the source of dispute between the 
airport authority and Ryanair. The draft decision on terminal charges by the Commission for Aviation Regulation will 
apply in Dublin, Cork and Shannon.
A consultation period of two months to allow interested parties to submit views will now take place.
The regulator will then consider all views received and will publish its final determination towards the end of the 
year.

All was well when the invitation arrived until I noticed the two dreaded words at the bottom: business casual.
With the possible exception of "tickets courtesy of Ryanair", I can think of no more depressing phrase in an 
invitation to any work event. Instead of just grabbing a suit, I was going to have to think about my ensemble. Are 
chinos too casual? Grey flannels too business? Suddenly a routine conference assumed the terrors of a red carpet: 
"OMG: Robert chooses chinos, so last season and a bit of a nightmare with those shoes." Or alternatively: "Oh no 
Shawna, here's someone in a lounge suit. You can always spot the first-timers."
Business casual is meant to indicate a relaxed, informal atmosphere; a forum conducive to ideas and conversation. 
But of course it is just as much of a uniform as anything else, and how you can you relax if you are the only one not 
wearing it?
To make matters even more complicated, the conference was in France and President Sarkozy was the opening 
speaker. Not that he'd be there by the time my workshop session got under way, but you couldn't help feeling he'd 
set the sartorial tone. Just to add to the calculations, this was a conference on the internet, meaning many of those 
present never wear suits, so there was a danger of looking seriously square (as if that isn't a danger most of the 
time in any case).
Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of chinos, a blazer and a good shirt, no tie. But I 
was still uneasy. So I turned to Wikipedia. It offered little practical extra help beyond noting that "the second-from-
the-top shirt button may also be opened in addition to the very top button." Even this fairly useless advice carried 
the rider "citation needed", as if to stress that the second button debate is still very much a live one.
I consulted a colleague who had worked in Paris on how he would interpret business casual. "Your best suit, a good 
shirt and possibly no tie," he replied without hesitation.
So I bottled it and wore a suit, which turned out to be the right decision because pretty much everyone else had 
done the same. Clearly the netizens were similarly intimidated by the gold-embossed invite as many of them were 
suits too. Mark Zuckerberg stuck to his guns and wore a T-shirt, but that's the kind of confidence that comes with a 
valuation in the billions.
Business Casual Makes Me Smart The National Conversation
Things got worse. Later there was to be a grand dinner for which the dress code was smart casual. It was clear by 
now that they were just toying with us. I turned again to Wikipedia. It advised that "smart casual" (as distinct from 
business casual) is "a loosely defined dress code, casual, yet 'smart' (ie 'neat') enough to conform to the particular 
standards of certain Western social groups". Or to put it another way: "You're on your own, pal."
A friend's wife acidly observes that "smart casual" means smart for the women and casual for the men. What is true 
is that if all these opaque dress codes are difficult for men, they must be torture for women. Dress or trousers? 
Fitted or flared skirt? Patterned or plain? Bare arms or covered? Is visible cleavage appropriate? This is tough. 
However stressful these dress codes are for men, at least we don't have to spend time in front of the mirror fretting 
over the right amount of lunchbox to display in outline.
At the other end of the spectrum is black tie; now seemingly the preserve of awards dinners and the annual 
company knees-up. For those who dislike this garb but who know it is rude to refuse to abide by the dress code, 
this is something of a blessing. For it means the words "black tie" on any work-related invitation signify an 
inessential event, something that can be missed unless you've a penchant for overcooked chicken. It may be good 
for networking but if there was any real work going on, an ordinary suit would be fine.
Business casual is not liberating but oppressive. Surely it should either be work clothes or casual? In between is 
hopeless. Anything else is a failure to understand the purpose o work clothes, which are not to stand out, but to fit 
in. Freedom at work is a nicely tailored suit, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Discount carrier struggles to fly in Caribbean
Discount carrier struggles to fly in Caribbean

KINGSTON, Jamaica The Caribbean's first discount airline is having a rough time getting off the ground and the 
company's Irish chief executive blames political fear of competition for the region's government-affiliated carriers.
Ian Burns dreams of creating a Caribbean version of Europe's cut-rate Ryanair, advertising flights for as little as $10 
that would make it dramatically easier for people across the islands to fly and do business, boosting the region's 
economy. People in the Caribbean have long complained that costly, inefficient air service has choked back 
investment and jobs.
But regulators in two key countries have not yet given Burns' REDjet permission to operate. And so far he's unable 
to offer any flights to the United States, the most important source of travelers and trade for the Caribbean.
"There is obviously some sort of political interference going on. Our point is, let the consumer decide by giving them 
a choice. We're not going to cost the taxpayers a bit of money if we fail, so why can't the market decide?" Burns told 
The Associated Press this week.
Burns, a former partner of a British accounting firm and a past president of Dublin's Wanderers rugby club, has no 
previous experience running an airline but he seems to have plenty of business connections. He says he is "close 
friends" with Irish telecommunications tycoon Denis O'Brien and has received counsel from top brass at Ryanair, 
the Dublin-based airline that thrived during Europe's recession by offering rock-bottom rates.
His short-haul, low-cost airline recently launched inaugural flights from its Barbados base to Guyana, using two 
149-seat MD-82 passenger jets.
Burns said the company has met all the requirements to operate in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, two of the 
region's largest countries, though Roger Williams, managing partner of Miami-based Airline Information, said Burns 
and REDjet have not helped themselves by aggressively advertising cheap fares to those islands before receiving 
approval to land there.
"I can empathize with their reasons for doing so, however it will not aid them in navigating the regulatory 
bureaucracy in the region," Williams said. Aviation red tape "can be complex within the Caribbean and a very slow 
process."
Discount carrier struggles to fly in Caribbean
Nicole Hutchinson, spokeswoman for Jamaica's civil aviation authority, said the country's evaluation of an air 
service license is "highly objective and remains free from political or any other interference." She declined to 
estimate how long a decision might take.
In Trinidad, Transport Minister Jack Warner has expressed indignation that REDjet was offering fares to his country 
before getting regulators' approval.
"I am not against competition but I don't think that competition should be based on a degree of lawlessness," 
Warner said about REDjet in April.
Warner has since been suspended from his more high-profile post as vice president of soccer's global governing 
body, FIFA, pending an inquiry into allegations of vote-buying in the organization's leadership election.
Goverment-affiliated airlines have carried business travelers, tourists and goods across the geographically 
fragmented Caribbean, a region of small island nations dotted in wide expanses of water. But the carriers have 
been plagued by inefficiency, strikes and a lack of capital.
Antigua-based LIAT, Air Jamaica and Trinidad-based BWIA have reported millions of dollars in losses.
Last week, Caribbean Airlines, the Trinidad-based carrier which replaced BWIA in 2007, concluded its acquisition of 
Air Jamaica, which had racked up about $1.2 billion in debt.
Analysts agree with Burns that a low-fare alternative is needed.
"The Caribbean certainly needs to be stimulated as far as price; it is one of the highest priced airline markets in the 
world," Williams said from Miami. "However, the Caribbean also needs reliable air service, something that its own 
airlines have failed to consistently deliver."
Vaughn Cordle, managing partner for Washington, D.C.-based Airline Forecasts, said, "The glut of used aircraft and 
the high-fare environment makes it a good time for new upstarts to get off the ground."
But he warned that "most fail because they are undercapitalized and cannot absorb the losses in the early stage of 
the life cycle."
Burns says REDjet will succeed by cost-cutting: no free food or business class service, fast turnarounds at airports 
to save on parking fees, no overnighting by staff and use of Internet reservations to eliminate booking offices.
REDjet's published fares would allow a round trip from Trinidad to Barbados with no checked baggage for $103.42, 
66 percent cheaper than the least expensive flight from Caribbean Airlines.
The airline was founded in 2006 after Burns' son, Robbie, worked in Jamaica for Digicel and was surprised at the 
price of flights. Burns said attempts to set up the company in Jamaica fizzled in 2007 and REDjet later moved on to 
Barbados, making it the only passenger line based there.
But that has created another problem for the company. REDjet announced on April 11 it had finally received 
permission to operate in Barbados. Just a day later, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it had barred new 
Barbados-based carriers from flying to the U.S.
The FAA noted that Barbados was certifying an air carrier "with the goal of serving the United States," but it said 
Barbados failed to meet international standards for oversight of airlines.
Anthony Archer, director of Barbados' Civil Aviation Department, said that his agency is beefing up its staff. But it 
can take months or years to reverse such FAA rulings. A downgrade of Mexico last year was undone in a relatively 
short six months. Israel received a similar downgrade in 2008 and has not yet regained the top rating.
Discount carrier struggles to fly in Caribbean
Aviation analysts agree that REDjet eventually will need U.S. flights, especially since it faces a relatively small, 
scattered local market.
"Even though discount airlines like Ryanair, and years ago Laker Airways and People Xpress, literally created new 
air travelers with ultra-low prices, they still tapped areas with high population densities. I would say that US rights 
are essential for REDjet's long-term growth," Williams said.
Burns said U.S. flights are not a priority at the moment: "Our fares and our structures are designed to make money" 
serving the Caribbean market.
Burns argues that Trinidad and Jamaica are breaching international aviation agreements by failing to approve 
REDjet's operations.
"You can postpone this for a certain period of time, but you cannot stop it," he said.
Associated Press writer Joan Lowy in Washington contributed to this report.

The ISEQ fell this morning as investors reacted to some worrying trends in Ireland crucial services sector.
By 12:30, the index had fallen by 10.82 points to 2,952.84.
Ireland's services sector posted anaemic growth in May with new export orders just making up for weak domestic 
demand, a survey shows this morning. The NCB Purchasing Managers' Index, which measures activity in the 
services sector nudged up to 50.5 from 50.2 in April, just above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. 
Service PMI numbers will be released later today for the euro area, UK and US. In the UK, the services PMI is 
expected to tick up slightly, having fallen back in April. Similarly, the plunge in the US ISM non-manufacturing 
composite index since the beginning of the year is expected to end in April with a small rise.
Ryanair's May numbers will still be affected by last year's ash cloud disruption. However, Ryanair compares actual 
booked passengers and as such we would expect high-single-digit growth in passenger numbers - flown passenger 
growth would be much higher - and loads close to 80pc (81pc last year). Shares in the airline gained 2c to E3.63. 
ARTBA (American Road and Transportation Builders Association) has held a conference call on the outlook for the 
US transportation construction market. It has left its growth forecasts for highways and bridges unchanged for 2011, 
with a 4.4pc decline expected, which is in line with our expectations. However, based on a scenario of no major 
changes in future investment levels and minimal growth in the economy, the sector will not grow by more than 1pc 
per annum in subsequent years. The estimates set out by ARTBA for 2012 and beyond are more bearish than what 
is incorporated in our forecasts for CRH, said Goodbody Stockbrokers. CRH shares fell 9c to E14.58. Bank of 
Ireland this morning gave some more details on its capital-raising scheme with a E2.6 billion offer of junior bonds for 
shares and a cash offer with the investors getting just 10pc of the face value of the debt. The rights issue will these 
shares will be underwritten by the State at 10 cent per share. The bank's shares fell 1c to E0.15, Irish Life and 
Permanent's stocks rose 1c to E0.10 while AIB dropped 1c to E0.17.

The ISEQ closed the week on a downer as investors reacted to some worrying trends in Ireland's crucial services 
sector and as Moody's warned the US over its debt.
The index fell 23.16 points to 2,940.50.
Ireland's services sector posted anaemic growth in May with new export orders just making up for weak domestic 
demand, a survey shows this morning.
A dismal jobs report drove shares lower on Friday on fears of an economic slowdown, but with the market facing 
five weeks of losses, signs of growth in the U.S. services sector lifted stocks off their lows. The three major U.S. 
stock indexes fell more than 1 percent to hit session lows shortly after the open following the government's report 
that only 54,000 jobs were added in May -- far less than even reduced expectations. This was the weakest reading 
since September for U.S. non-farm payrolls growth, while the country's jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent in May from 
9 percent in April. Ryanair's May numbers will still be affected by last year's ash cloud disruption. However, Ryanair 
compares actual booked passengers and as such we would expect high-single-digit growth in passenger numbers - 
flown passenger growth would be much higher - and loads close to 80pc (81pc last year). Shares in the airline 
gained 4c to E3.65. ARTBA (American Road and Transportation Builders Association) has held a conference call 
on the outlook for the US transportation construction market. It has left its growth forecasts for highways and 
bridges unchanged for 2011, with a 4.4pc decline expected, which is in line with our expectations. However, based 
on a scenario of no major changes in future investment levels and minimal growth in the economy, the sector will 
not grow by more than 1pc per annum in subsequent years. The estimates set out by ARTBA for 2012 and beyond 
are more bearish than what is incorporated in our forecasts for CRH, said Goodbody Stockbrokers. CRH shares fell 
19c to E14.48. Bank of Ireland this morning gave some more details on its capital-raising scheme with a E2.6 billion 
offer of junior bonds for shares and a cash offer with the investors getting just 10pc of the face value of the debt. 
ISEQ closes the week on a downer ISEQ Down
The rights issue will these shares will be underwritten by the State at 10 cent per share. The bank's shares fell 2c to 
E0.14, Irish Life and Permanent's stocks were flat at E0.09 while AIB was unmoved at E0.19. Model Group, a Swiss 
based recycled containerboard manufacturer, is set to take maintenance downtime at its 160k tonne mill for five 
weeks. This has the potential of taking 15k tonnes of product out of the system. Smurfit Kappa shares fell 17c to 
E8.15. Independent News and Media shares were flat at E0.57 after a representative of Denis O'Brien has lost his 
seat on the board at an AGM vote. This followed a vote at the group's AGM, in which 57pc of shareholders voted 
against Leslie Buckley's return to the board. Mr Buckley accepted the vote, but, in a statement, called on the group 
chairman and chief executive to consider their positions.

The City A.M. team has been named the "Aston Villa" of the contest as 9-1 contenders, while team Bank of England 
is Manchester City at 12-1 "because of the financial reserves behind them" and the Sky News squad has been

WorldSpreads, the Dublin-based spread betting company, has named Charlie McCreevy , the former EU 
Commissioner and Irish finance minister, as a non-executive director with immediate effect.
The eurozone heavy hitter will take an active part in the group's growth on the continent and develop new 
partnerships with banks, stockbrokers and other financial third parties, said Conor Foley, chief executive.
Mr McCreevy was previously EU commissioner for internal market and services before his retirement last year. He 
served as Irish minister for finance from 1997, when he steered Ireland's entry into the euro. He was also Ireland's 
minister for social welfare, tourism and trade and holds non-executive director positions at Sports Direct 
International and Ryanair in addition to his role as director of Dublin-based BNY Mellon Clearing, a subsidiary of the 
global banking group.
WorldSpreads has opened in Germany, France, Sweden and Denmark as part of its expansion plans. Handily, its 
array of instruments in stocks, bonds and foreign exchange lets investors take positions betting on likely defaults of 
rescued eurozone states, like, er, Ireland.

The ISEQ slipped back in to negative territory as investors brooded over a run of weak global economic indicators 
and as Exchequer figures for May were underwhelming.
The index fell 7.64 points to 2,963.66.
Markets are continuing to come to terms with the raft of poor data. World stocks and oil slumped for a second 
straight day on Thursday as the latest U.S. economic data kept investors on the edge, with a slight drop in claims 
for jobless benefits not enough to assuage fears about the economy's path. The dollar fell to a one-month low 
against the euro as Greece agreed to new measures to cut its deficit, mitigating fears over its debt crisis and 
making investors shift their focus to the U.S. economy. On Wall Street, the benchmark Standard and Poor's 500 
index fell below its May low as investors reacted to the data on jobless claims.
In the UK, Kingfisher has released (June 2nd) headline figures for its first quarter, which covered the February-to-
April period. Group revenues rose 3.3pc to £2.73bn with like-for-like (lfl) sales also up 3.3pc. Retail profit rose 19pc 
year-on-year (yoy) to £174m as margins improved 90bps to 6.4pc. Shares in Ireland's Grafton Group fell 7c to 
E3.45. This week, Paddy Power held what Davy analysts say was a very successful investor day in London 
focusing on the group's online business in the UK and Ireland, 'paddypower.com'. "The investor day included a 
number of very impressive presentations. What came across clearly was the passion, drive, expertise and 
experience within the group and also the confidence of managers in the ability of their departments to continue to 
contribute to the growth of paddypower.com. A significant investment has been made in recent years in all areas of 
the business, and we have no doubt that while this has helped drive growth to date, there is plenty of left in the tank 
for future growth," said Simon McGrotty of Davy Research. Paddy Power's shares climbed 29c to E36.30. DCC's 
strategy has delivered highly attractive returns to shareholders. Since listing in 1994, the group has had an 
impressive, unbroken track record of adjusted EPS (17-year CAGR of 13.2pc) and dividend growth (17-year CAGR

of 15.6pc). Shares in the group rose 3c to E21.53. A few weeks ago, Ryanair announced that it was trialling 
reserved seating on flights between Dublin/Gatwick and Dublin/Malaga on the first 2 rows and the exit rows over the 
wings at E10 each way (including priority boarding, which normally costs E4). The airline has indicated that the 
trials have proved to be far more successful than anticipated and that an extension of the scheme would take place 
on another route this summer. Shares in the airline gained 6c to E3.61. Aer Lingus stocks gained 4c to E0.81 as its 
management team and pilots' representatives met to thrash out a resolution in a rostering dispute that has the

Jackson Square Aviation: building an aircraft portfolio
Jackson Square Aviation: building an aircraft portfolio
AirFinance Journal

Byline: Sophie Segal
Highlight: Jackson Square Aviation's management speaks to Airfinance Journal about leasing aircraft and sourcing 
finance 15 months after launching with equity from Oaktree Capital.
Body
Asking bankers to take additional risks after a deal has already been agreed is never an easy task. So when an 
earthquake struck Japan in March, resulting in a large-scale nuclear disaster, Jackson Square Aviation (JSA) spent 
nights on the phone to Tokyo, reassuring lenders that there was no radiation risk to the 737-800 they were about to 
deliver to JAL.
Rich Wiley, CEO, JSA says there was no additional risk to the aircraft. "Every aircraft that flies in the air is 
radioactive," he says casually.
Perhaps it is down to years of experience in the leasing business, but one year after launching JSA the lessor was 
able to support its Japanese customer through the crisis. "We were able to deliver during that crisis," says Scott 
Weiss, chief operating officer and head of capital markets, JSA.
When JSA started operations early last year it was ahead of the aircraft leasing rat race. As the first company to 
announce it had linked up with an equity investor - private equity firm Oaktree Capital - some might suggest the 
company had a competitive advantage. But being nimble and having experienced management has helped the 
company move fast to acquire a portfolio of over 30 aircraft over the last 15 months.
But timing has played its part too. The sale/leaseback market has been buoyant over the last 18 months as airlines 
try to reduce capacity due to economic conditions and fuel prices - so there has been a lot of appetite for JSA's 
product.
The lessor's average fleet age is under one-year and the average lease term is nine years to 10 years. And, in June 
the company delivered seven aircraft to airlines like Malaysian Airlines and Wizz Air - more deliveries than most 
large airlines like Ryanair or Southwest Airlines would take in a single month. This week alone JSA will deliver one 
aircraft each to Air Berlin, Air France and JAL.
While the company is not the only lessor to be focusing on the sale/leaseback market, Wiley feels that its ability to 
be nimble differentiates it from other new entrants. "JSA believes our business model to be conservative regarding 
aircraft acquisitions - we can make investments on short-term identified aircraft opportunities - in addition to 
managing our liability risk to the aircraft lease," says Wiley.
Jackson Square Aviation: building an aircraft portfolio
The company says it remains competitive by doing multiple aircraft deals. For instance, JSA has closed deals with 
Wizz Air for three aircraft; JAL for five aircraft; and, Volaris for seven aircraft.
A year since launching JSA has has acquired about 30 aircraft through sale/leasebacks, with commitments for an 
additional 40. The fleet comprises mainly of narrowbodies, as well as several widebodies.
While its competitors focus almost exclusively on acquiring Next Generation A320s and 737s, JSA is looking at 
freighters. "We always been supportive of freighters as such capacity actually stabilizes your earnings throughout 
various cycles," says Weiss. "It has been historically a leading indicator of the downturn of a cycle and its recovery. 
It actually provides JSA access to excellent credits that fly the latest technology freighters."
It is in discussions regarding a sale/leaseback for a 747-8F, the first of which recently delivered to Cargolux last 
week after making its debut at the Paris Air Show.
The lessor will develop a diverse portfolio as it continues to acquire aircraft. "Our growth strategy is to reflect the 
diversity of the world's airlines order book, whether it be narrowbodies, widebodies or freighters, with a strong focus 
on latest technology aircraft," says Wiley.
For sale/leasebacks, like most lessors, JSA considers aircraft price, credit, jurisdiction, tenor and the remarketability 
of the aircraft. For less strong credits the lessor requires more stringent maintenance reserve terms in the lease.
The company is also willing to lease aircraft to riskier regions. "We manage tougher jurisdictions either through 
head lease/sub lease structures through regions like Ireland or require the airline to N register the aircraft," says 
Weiss. "This way you're not just relying on more challenging, local judicial systems to deregister your aircraft." He 
notes that Cape Town is also helpful, though it remains untested.
Commercial loans and export credit
JSA opened for business in January 2010 with a $500 million equity cheque from shareholder Oaktree, a private 
equity firm based in Los Angeles, CA. While still within the original commitment Wiley anticipates a need for 
additional equity in the future.
In addition to Oaktree's equity commitment, during the last 15 months JSA has raised in excess of $1.5 billion in 
debt. Wiley says the management has been able to leverage relationships built in the past at Pegasus and Pafco, 
both previously managed by Wiley.
JSA raises long-term debt with bilateral long-term loans and has also closed two warehouse facilities, totaling $620 
million.
Raising long-term debt is essential to the company's financing strategy. Part of the company's strategy is to match 
asset life with the financing term, and Wiley sees this as essential in managing JSA's liabilities. "A stumbling block 
for any leasing company is reliance on short-term debt with long-term assets, which can be very good for the rate 
differential during good times, but in the event of financial instability the inability to rollover debt can be a problem."
Most recently in June the company closed a $220 million warehouse underwritten by NordLB and UniCredit.
The facility allows JSA to draw down until 2012 with a term-out feature that extends to 2019. The facility finances a 
mix of pre-committed aircraft and future Airbus and Boeing narrowbody deliveries.
In June JSA also had another major announcement. The company reported that it is newly eligible for export credit 
financing - the first newly established lessor to be approved by the European export credit agencies.
JSA has already financed three aircraft to European and Asian airlines in June. BNP Paribas acted as advisor and 
placement agent to JSA and Natixis acted as agent and security trustee. 
Jackson Square Aviation: building an aircraft portfolio
The lessor says commercial financing remains attractive however. "Margins are staying consistent because of the 
low interest rate environment," says Wiley. "So it's an attractive time to accumulate aircraft assets."
Aircraft lessors are looking increasingly to the capital markets for funding and JSA is no exception. "We'll be looking 
at the capital markets to round out our balance sheet in the third quarter, but will always continue to partner with our 
relationship banks through commercial loans and warehouse/term loan facilities," says Weiss.
Recapitalizing with possible IPO
During the last year, JSA has come a long way. After establishing its headquarters in San Francisco last year, JSA 
has opened offices in Seattle, London, Toulouse, Singapore and Miami.
"Our growth strategy is to reflect the diversity of the world's airline order book, whether it be narrowbodies, 
widebodies or freighters, with a strong focus on latest technology aircraft," says Wiley. 
JSA forecasts that it will close 80 aircraft before the end of 2011 using a combination of export credit, bilateral loans 
and capital markets to finance acquisitions.
In the second quarter of 2012 the lessor will address refinancing. "We are targeted to accumulate a portfolio of 
about 100 aircraft," says Wiley. "Then we will address recapitalization issues."
Possible options include: an initial public offering (IPO), bringing in another strategic investor, or a sale of the 
company.
"We feel that if you get too large and you don't execute on a particular capital program to bring down your cost of 
financing then you could get too big to execute in certain markets," says Wiley.
The company confirms that it is always speaking to the manufacturers and would consider speculative orders at a 
later date, but at the moment it remains focused on the sale/leaseback market. By not having to place aircraft, the 
company can focus on financing when airlines have over capacity - which has been prevalent particularly during the 
last 12 to 18 months.
In fact, while it has not placed direct orders with the manufacturers, JSA views itself as having a small orderbook 
already. When the lessor provides pre-delivery payments for its customers the contract is assigned to JSA. "It's 
presold to the airline who we're providing the PDP financing and JSA has an agreed price for the aircraft," says 
Wiley.
This also gives the JSA an inside peak at what airlines are paying for aircraft.
Since launching over a year ago JSA has celebrated quite a few milestones including being the first new lessor to 
be eligible for export credit funding, raising over $1.5 billion in debt and delivering an aircraft during a national 
disaster to support a customer.
But there are goals ahead, like closing a capital markets transaction before year-end, and refinancing for 2012. 
And, if management choose an IPO to recapitalize, then Jackson Square Aviation could be a publicly traded 
company within a year.

Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus warned Tuesday its services could be grounded indefinitely if pilots carry out a threat next 
week to disrupt their work schedules.
Aer Lingus members of the Irish Air Line Pilots Association told the airline that pilots will report for duty one hour 
late and refuse to reschedule work days starting June 7. About 87 percent of pilots voted to take the action over 
company efforts to make them accept longer working hours and more flexible shifts.
"This withdrawal of flexibility will destroy our ability to operate a proper schedule as we will miss our airport slot 
times, parking stands, gate positions and will be unable to fulfill flight connections for customers," said Christoph 
Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus.
He said the pilots' delayed arrivals would clash with the fixed work shifts of cabin crews and "may lead to a full 
cancellation of operations" starting June 7.
Airline executives and the pilots' union, Impact, were expected to seek a resolution in negotiations mediated by the 
Labour Relations Commission in Dublin, but the two sides appeared far apart.
Aer Lingus has repeatedly battled labor unions and suffered service disruptions since Ireland's privatization of the 
airline in 2006. It has laid off nearly two-thirds of its 2006 work force, an expensive proposition that required large 
compensation payments.
The carrier faces stiff competition on European routes from its larger Dublin-based rival Ryanair, Europe's biggest 
budget airline.
Ryanair, which refuses to negotiate with unions, since 2006 has sought to acquire Aer Lingus and already is its 
biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake. Aer Lingus, its employees and the Irish government which retains a 25 
percent stake all oppose any Ryanair takeover.
Aer Lingus' traditional income-earner, trans-Atlantic routes linking Ireland with several U.S. cities, has been 
squeezed by tough economic times and increased direct competition with American, Continental and Delta airlines.
Aer Lingus warns pilot protests may ground flights
Aer Lingus returned to net profit in 2010 for the first time in three years but has warned it could struggle to break 
even this year given Ireland's continuing recession and rising fuel costs.
Aer Lingus shares fell 3 percent to (EURO)0.79 ($1.14) on Tuesday's news of renewed labor unrest.

Europe learns ash lessons
When news emerged that the Grimsvötn volcano in Iceland had begun erupting at 19:00 UTC on 21 May, the 
aviation industry could have been forgiven for fearing the worst.
The initial explosion sent an ash plume over 65,500ft (20,000m) into the atmosphere, twice as high as the eruption 
of Eyjafjallajökull in April 2010.
Although flights into airports into the northern UK suffered two days of disruption as the cloud drifted south, with 
German airspace also affected, a repeat of the shutdown of European airspace experienced last year did not occur. 
Eurocontrol said 900 flights from a total of 90,000 between 23 and 25 May were cancelled.
Although there were differences in the two events - notably in the duration and strength of the eruption, which had 
ceased by 02:00 UTC on 25 May - experts are agreed that Europe's systems coped better this time.
ENDORSEMENT
The Association of European Airlines and the Airports Council International - Europe generally endorsed the 
advances since last year and the systems now in place. Olivier Jankovec, ACI-E director general said: "For those 
feeling a sense of déjà vu, I can tell you that this latest eruption is being handled in a very different manner. 
Lessons have been learned from the previous volcanic ash shock in April 2010.
"This past year, the European Commission, Eurocontrol and the European Aviation Safety Agency have worked 
intensely to devise an alternative procedure for flight operations, safeguarding the highest possible level of safety, 
while minimising disruption. This procedure is at the disposal of national governments. It now needs to be applied 
promptly and consistently throughout Europe."
Eurocontrol said that instead of a blanket ban, as had applied last year, member states used "a more precise tool" 
to assess risk. This, it said, helped to minimise airspace closures.
Europe learns ash lesson
There were dissenting voices, however, the loudest perhaps from Ryanair. The Irish budget carrier described 
restrictions on flights to and from Scottish airports as unnecessary. It cancelled 36 flights to or from Scottish airports 
on 24 May on the advice of the Irish Aviation Authority.
It pointed to a 1h verification flight over Scotland on 24 May at an altitude of 41,000ft, which it said found no traces 
of ash, as proof of its position.
It described the red zone of high-density ash as "a misguided invention by the UK Met Office and the CAA".
However, the Civil Aviation Authority later disputed the course taken by Ryanair's aircraft.
A later verification flight by British Airways using an Airbus A320, in co-operation with the CAA, was flown into the 
"red zone" in Scottish airspace for about 45min and suffered no observable damage, the airline reported. However, 
it has yet to test various filters that were renewed specifically for this flight.
The Met Office described the BA flight results as "useful", and said that there have also been numerous pilot reports 
of visible ash in UK airspace and over the North Sea. All data from all sources is useful, the Met Office said.
But the Met Office has been criticised for the absence of the only test aircraft available to it, a BAe 146 operated by 
the Natural Environment Research Council, which is at work in North Africa on a project booked some time ago.
The International Air Transport Association's director general Giovanni Bisignani voiced his anger about the lack of 
a research aircraft to the UK's Department for Transport, but the UK Met Office pointed out that airborne monitoring 
is only one of the many ways in which ash can be tracked and its concentration measured, suggesting we 
"shouldn't be too hung up" about the lack of available aircraft-mounted sensors.
A test aircraft is only one of an arsenal of ash analysis weapons, said the Met Office, and it is not guaranteed to be 
any more useful than the alternatives because it can only "take a snapshot" of conditions in a small part of the 
vertical and horizontal airspace affected by ash.
For Eurocontrol, the next step is for its crisis cell members to analyse their response to the ash cloud and the 
lessons learned and prepare a report to be presented to EU transport ministers in June.

There is disagreement about whether Europe has adopted the best available strategy for dealing with atmospheric 
volcanic ash.
The split arises when individual airline leaders highlight an apparent failure by the authorities to allow business as 
usual when it looks as if it might have been possible. Meanwhile, the majority seem to believe the current strategy is 
the best available until we learn more about the phenomenon and gain more local experience of living with it.
Those who, like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, say Europe should adopt Alaskan Airways' standard operating 
procedures conveniently forget a simple fact: Alaskan has lived with volcanic activity all its operating life. Alaska 
and the Rockies are its backyard, so it knows about the peculiarities and micro-climates. Its crews are trained and 
regularly refreshed in ash encounter drills. Its standard operating procedures were developed over years and are in 
the blood of its employees.
None of those things is true of Europe, which is at a very early stage on its ash operations learning curve. That 
does not mean we should fail to learn from best practice elsewhere, but it does mean that meteorologists and 
engine makers in particular should be doing more to improve knowledge of ash measurement techniques, 
operational risks and equipment limitations.
The Association of European Airlines has said it is pleased with the advances Europe has made in atmospheric ash 
operational strategy since last year. But that progress has been easy because the continent's 2010 encounter was 
marked by total chaos resulting from ignorance and unpreparedness.
This year we know more, but our knowledge is pathetic compared with what we need to know. Europe's volcanic 
ash risk management system is bound to err on the side of caution until our knowledge and experience increases, 
and with it our confidence.
A clash over ash Opinion may be divided on how to cope with volcanic eruptions. But caution is the only option 
until Europe has scaled a steep learning curve - ....
Meanwhile, Iceland's volcanologists have warned us that their geologically young and vigorous island is entering a 
period of heightened seismic activity, so increasing our knowledge about all the parameters that define safe ash 
operation is not just an option: it is essential to do so if we are to avoid serious long-term economic damage.

Cooking up a new codename
Military programme names often raise eyebrows due to the seemingly random way in which they are chosen, but 
the top prize must go to the South African Air Force's search for a new maritime patrol aircraft to replace its 
Douglas DC-3 Dakotas. Speaking at the service's annual airpower display in Limpopo in mid-May, air force chief Lt 
Gen Carlo Gagiano announced that the SAAF's vintage surveillance aircraft are to be replaced via Project 
"Saucepan". On hearing the unusual moniker, one UK-based hack was swift to comment: "Saucepan? Perhaps he 
heard that's what the UK turned its Nimrod MRA4s into."
Ryan-where?
Ryanair has long been a believer in the no publicity is bad publicity adage, so no surprises if an uplift in ticket sales 
results from its "admission" that, due to a printing error, three passengers on one flight from Milan to Madrid won a 
free car worth E13,000 on its scratchcard game (generally the airline gives away one car a month) and it does not 
know how many other rogue cards are out there. Easy, Michaeltoo many of these free cars and folks won't have to 
fly Ryanair.
Brassed off
Picture the scene: CEO of mighty aerospace company sat down to convivial lunch with powerful business 
journalists.

admirals and airfield marshals?"

chance to escape economy hell and buy a bit more legroom than the well-refreshed blokes on a stag weekend or 
the excitable family of four sitting behind you on your cramped jumbo to Vegas or Orlando.

We were delighted to receive an invitation from Oklahoma to come and discuss the "amazing infrastructure and 
assets the state has to offer in the aerospace and unmanned aerial system (drone) sectors" at the Paris air show.
Last month, the email continues, the state hosted "12 prominent international journalists specialising in aerospace 
to see for themselves what's happening in Oklahoma, and they were blown away by what they saw".
Sounds like it was a pretty effective demonstration of the accuracy and lethality of these UAVs.

The ISEQ barely moved this morning with both the London markets and Wall Street closed for public holidays.
By 12:30, the index had risen by 1.28 points to 2,968.83.
European stocks inched up in holiday-thinned trade, with gains limited as German utilities dropped on a government 
decision to shut all the country's nuclear reactors by 2022. Volumes were thin as both U.S. and UK markets were 
closed for a public holiday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,135.55 
points, adding to the previous session's gains.
The eurozone's debt crisis remained in focus. The European Union is working on a second bailout package for 
Greece in a race to release vital loans next month and avert the risk of the euro zone country defaulting, EU officials 
said. Greece's conservative opposition meanwhile demanded lower taxes as a condition for reaching a political 
consensus with the Socialist government on further austerity measures, which Brussels says is needed to secure 
any further assistance. Moves to plug a looming funding gap for 2012 and 2013 were accelerated after the 
International Monetary Fund said last week it would withhold the next tranche of aid due on June 29 unless the EU 
guarantees to meet Athens' funding needs for next year. Senior EU officials held unannounced emergency talks 
with the Greek government over the weekend, an EU source said. There is speculation that Wolseley has put its UK 
heavyside business Build Center and the two smaller units of Encon and Electric Center up for sale. All businesses 
had being classified by Wolseley in the "Performance Builder" category and, as a result, if it could not improve the 
underlying businesses they would be put for sale. Both Travis Perkins and Grafton Group would be interested in 
Build Center and have the financial capacity to undertake such an acquisition, according to Goodbody 
Stockbrokers' analyst, Robert Eason. Shares in Grafton Group fell 1c to E3.45. The Commission for Aviation 
Regulation (CAR) has published its Draft Determination on Aviation Terminal Services for the Cork, Dublin and 
Shannon airports for the four years 2012-15. All interested parties may make representations by July 27, with a final

determination by the end of October. The 2012 starting cap represents a reduction of about 28pc on the 2011 cap. 
Thereafter the cap is expected to fall by a further 5pc per annum in real terms. Shares in Ryanair gained 3c to 
E3.55 while Aer Lingus dropped 2c to E0.81.

Threat of Iberia pilots' strike over short-haul restructuring
Threat of Iberia pilots' strike over short-haul restructuring

Pilots at Iberia could threaten to strike this summer if a two-year stalemate over the future of the Spanish carrier's 
short-haul operations is not resolved, dealing a blow to the newly formed International Airlines Group.
Negotiators from Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, are due to sit down with management today for further talks after 
receiving almost unanimous backing from its 1,650 members at Iberia to call strike action at meetings last week.
Almost all of Iberia's pilots are members of the union, meaning any industrial action would ground the airline. The 
escalation of the dispute would leave IAG, formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia, facing the prospect 
of further industrial relations problems.
Earlier this month, BA cabin crew voted to back a deal ending one of the most bitter and longest disputes in the UK 
transport sector in recent years .
Iberia's pilots are opposed to plans by the Spanish carrier to overhaul its domestic and European operations. The 
airline said the short-haul network is unprofitable but does not break out the figures. Last year, before its merger 
with BA, Iberia reported an operating loss of EUR26m ($37m).
As the incumbent in the biggest leisure market in Europe, Iberia faces stiff competition from airlines all over the 
continent, not least the two biggest low-cost carriers, Ryanair and EasyJet.
Its domestic operations are also struggling to compete with a number of aggressive, low-cost carriers, including 
Ryanair and Air Berlin.
"Spain is an exceedingly competitive market," said Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at RBS in London.
Iberia's pilots are growing increasingly angry with management after the airline took the decision in March to 
outsource about 10 per cent of its short-haul operations to low-cost airlines - Air Nostrum, a wholly owned 
subsidiary and Veuling, in which Iberia has a 45 per cent stake.
Threat of Iberia pilots' strike over short-haul restructuring
Justo Peral, chairman of Sepla's executive council and an Iberia pilot, said the union had offered concessions on 
pay and conditions that would cut the cost of Iberia's short and medium-haul operations by almost 40 per cent, 
rising to 53 per cent by 2019. He said the numbers had been verified by UK auditor Grant Thornton and the audit 
would be presented to management.
"We are not talking about striking this summer but anything is possible," Mr Peral said, adding he was "not too 
optimistic" about making progress in negotiations with management.
Iberia said it was looking to "reach an agreement with our pilots" but insisted that it would not accept concessions 
on pay alone. The airline said it wants agreement to move all its existing short and medium-haul pilots into long-
haul operations over time, where pay is higher, and then hire new pilots for European operations on different 
contracts.
Iberia said it already had the agreement from cabin crew and ground staff to restructure the short-haul business.

Irish shares have edged higher in quiet trade this morning.
Their gains have been in line with trends on other European exchanges, though a public holiday today in Britain has 
quietened things.
The ISEQ index was 7.82 points ahead a short time ago at 2,975.37, adding to its gains of Friday.
Grafton was unchanged at 346 despite a weekend report that it may bid for three UK businesses being sold by 
Wolseley. Other big names were mixed. Elan was down by 7c to 654, but CRH was up by 4c to 1509 and DCC had 
risen by 24c to 2105. Irish Continental has added another 45c to 1665, with Ryanair up 1c to 353 and Smurfit 
Kappa rising 8c to 840.

Irish shares have edged higher in quiet trade this morning.
Their gains have been in line with trends on other European exchanges, though a public holiday today in Britain has 
quietened things.
The ISEQ index was 7.82 points ahead a short time ago at 2,975.37, adding to its gains of Friday.
Grafton was unchanged at 346 despite a weekend report that it may bid for three UK businesses being sold by 
Wolseley. Other big names were mixed. Elan was down by 7c to 654, but CRH was up by 4c to 1509 and DCC had 
risen by 24c to 2105. Irish Continental has added another 45c to 1665, with Ryanair up 1c to 353 and Smurfit 
Kappa rising 8c to 840.

Body
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, was his usual vociferous self in berating the authorities over the closure 
of airspace following the latest volcanic eruption last weekend, writes Mark Odell .
"Bureaucratic incompetence," he said, had caused his airline and others to cancel a total of 900 flights across 
northern Europe in the first part of the week as regulators closed airspace affected by the ash cloud.
Similar, more subtle pressure from other airlines has led politicians and regulators to acknowledge that more work 
is needed to minimise disruption, even as Europe breathed a collective sigh of relief as the eruption eased, 
seemingly ending the threat of a return to the level of chaos seen during last year's ash cloud.
Yet Mr O'Leary's railing at the ash cloud and the enforced grounding of 66 Ryanair flights this week overshadowed 
what appears a seminal moment - t he voluntary grounding of up to 80 aircraft this winter that will result in the first 
cut in capacity in the low-cost carrier's 26 years.
The overall cut in capacity - up to 5 per cent - may be relatively small but some analysts are already heralding it as 
more than symbolic in the context of the stellar growth course Mr O'Leary has put Ryanair on in his 17 years as 
chief executive.
Mr O'Leary, who has turned Ryanair into Europe's biggest short-haul airline by passenger numbers, says the cuts 
are a response to the high price of oil, which has jumped by more than 30 per cent since the start of the year, and 
the uncertain economic outlook.
But Chris Tarry, an analyst at Aviation Industry Research and Advisory, believes that Ryanair, like rival EasyJet, is 
for the first time facing the possibility that the European market is close to saturation.
"All markets mature and regional markets, which are where the low-cost carriers have been opening most of their 
new routes, mature very, very quickly indeed," Mr Tarry said.
Crowded skies test Ryanair model The week in review
Ryanair has typically expanded by 15-20 per cent a year, relying on the lowest costs in the industry to help it drive 
down fares and fill the seats by stimulating demand, as well as stealing market share from the legacy airlines. 
EasyJet was doing the same.
However, in recent years, there have been signs that both are changing tack. With little to trim from an already low 
cost base, the airlines are targeting top-line growth to push up margins. That means attracting business travellers 
prepared to pay higher fares and pushing up so-called ancillary revenues, from in-flight food and drinks sales to 
booking fees.
EasyJet already boasts that a fifth of its passengers travel on business but Ryanair is less forthcoming. However, 
recently it has started making changes designed to appeal to those travelling on business.
Ryanair has become known for flying passengers to out-of-the-way airports, avoiding congested, expensive main 
hubs. But there are signs of change. Last year it started flying into Barcelona's main El Prat airport and last month it 
broke with a key principle of the low-cost model by starting to take limited seat reservations on some routes.
Mr O'Leary laughed off suggestions that the winter capacity cuts signal saturation point. "No, not at all, not when we 
can fly all those aircraft again next April and fill them."
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at RBS, agrees with Mr O'Leary, arguing the big low-cost carriers will continue to 
grow at the expense of rivals.
"There are arguments that suggest developed Europe has approached maturity but the major low-cost carriers can 
take market share from rivals and will continue to grow in less well developed markets."

Body
There is a certain irony to the work economists do; they tend to judge where we are by looking at where we have 
just been. Economy Watch would compare this to being at sea; we don't know where we are, exactly, but we can 
measure how far we have travelled.
Officially data this week confirmed that we have not travelled much at all; the economy grew by just enough in the 
first quarter this year to cover the ground we lost at the end of last year.
More worrying was the revelation that households are every bit as badly off as the anecdotal evidence suggested. 
Household consumption fell even more sharply in the first quarter of this year than at the end of 2010 when 
spending might have been limited by bad weather.
Stretched households are not news to Ryanair which for the first time is set to ground more aircraft than it is buying 
because of the economic outlook and high fuel prices. And tough conditions in the high street mean that Marks and 
Spencer's chief executive is unlikely to receive his full bonus, even though sales there were better than at 
competitors.
While a closely watched survey of retailers found that sales in April were better than expected, they point to trouble 
ahead; unsold stock is at its highest level since 1984.
It turned out that the sector that contributed most to gross domestic product growth was government, a source of 
demand that is unlikely to continue in light of cuts set for this financial year. Indeed, at first blush, it appeared 
government took in less a nd spent more than expected when official data were released, but these were distorted 
by comparisons with the year before, when a bank tax took effect.
Standing in the path of those cuts is the nation's construction sector, where 40 per cent of activity currently depends 
on government spending.   Willmott Dixon warned that those cuts will lead to three years of fierce competition, 
rising inflation and supply chain failures.
Now data confirm it: we're all at sea
Also on the receiving end of the cuts are some elderly people. Local authorities are reducing the number they send 
to care homes, exacerbating the woes of Southern Cross , a leading provider which is also saddled with a big rental 
bill.
Perhaps even worse, it emerged that business investment fell sharply in the first quarter despite the fact that 
corporate coffers are stuffed with cash and industry surveys point to executives' intentions to step up investment 
activity.
The reason is unclear although one trade body, whose members are almost all manufacturers who export goods, 
has some ideas; when executives say they intend to invest, they may not mean in Britain. Increasingly, they want to 
site plants near customers.
Economy Watch ends the week wondering not where we are or even how far we have travelled. What would be 
more helpful is knowing where we are going.

Iceland volcano: No threat from ash cloud this weekend

   May 26, 2011 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
The ash cloud from the            Iceland volcano that erupted on Saturday is expected to have little or no impact on 
air traffic over the next 48 hours, European air traffic agency Eurocontrol said.
The Grimsovtn volcano is producing mostly steam rather than ash and activity should decline sharply within a few 
days. 
"The volcano is still active, but there is just steam and smoke," Hjalmar Bjorgvinsson, superintendent at the national 
police, told Reuters.
"I hope in a few days it will go to sleep again. Everything is moving in the            right direction."
The Grimsvotn volcano's eruption was more powerful than the explosion last year at another volcano but it has 
caused far less chaos for travellers because of new airline rules.
Eurocontrol said about 900 flights had been cancelled between Monday and Wednesday out of a total 90,000 
planned flights over the three days.
The eruption forced cancellations in flights in Scotland, northern England, Germany and parts of Scandinavia.
No airspace was closed due to volcanic ash on Thursday said Brian Flynn, head of network operations for the 
Brussels-based Eurocontrol agency.
The news came as scientists in Aberdeen released pictures of volcanic glass particles from Iceland which fell in the 
city.
Iceland volcano: No threat from ash cloud this weekend
The images show the jagged edges of the particles, which were taken from the windscreen of a clean car parked at 
the John Hutton Land Research Institute.
They were collected on Tuesday - the same day            Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary described the ash cloud as 
"mythical".
While experts say particles in the ash could stall jet engines and sandblast planes' windows, some airline 
executives have argued the flight bans were a massive overreaction by badly prepared safety regulators.

Flights canceled as volcanic ash touches Scotland
Flights canceled as volcanic ash touches Scotland

Ash spewing from an Icelandic volcano is bringing disruption and days of uncertainty to more parts of Europe, as 
officials in Germany said dozens of flights will be grounded on Wednesday.
Even though some say it's been a massive overreaction by badly prepared safety regulators one airline even claims 
the official scientific findings are simply wrong hundreds of flights were canceled Tuesday as winds blew the cloud 
of ash from the Grimsvotn volcano over Scotland and other parts of Europe. Experts say that particles in the ash 
could stall jet engines and sandblast planes' windows.
The only comfort for frustrated passengers and airlines is that officials in Iceland said the amount of ash being 
released by the volcano is decreasing, and officials don't expect the disruption to be as bad as last year, when 
millions were stranded after the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano.
Travelers trying to go to or leave Scotland have been hit hardest, but the problem also began to affect Germany, 
where weather officials said it would not allow any takeoffs or landings at the northern Bremen and Hamburg 
airports early Wednesday due to increased levels of ash in the atmosphere.
Dozens of domestic and international flights were to be affected by the closure early Wednesday. Authorities said it 
may be necessary to halt all air traffic coming and going from Berlin's airports, as well as Hannover, depending on 
the winds.
In Sweden, 10 domestic flights were canceled Tuesday evening. The country's aviation officials say they expect 
medium concentrations of ash over its western coast late Tuesday, including over its second-largest city Goteborg.
Although British authorities said concentrations of ash in the skies over Scotland were too high to fly through, Irish 
budget airline Ryanair challenged the results, saying it had sent its own airplane into Scottish airspace and found no 
ash in the atmosphere.
"All the data we are receiving confirms our forecasts, that there is high-density ash over Scotland," said Barry 
Grommett, spokesman for Britain's weather agency.
Flights canceled as volcanic ash touches Scotland
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary disagreed.
"Exactly as we predicted, we encountered absolutely no problems," he told The Associated Press. "There's no 
cloud over Scotland. There's no dusting of ash on the airframe or the wings. The airspace over Scotland should 
never have been restricted in the first place."
Still, Ryanair was forced by Irish authorities to cancel all 68 flights in and out of Scotland for the rest of Tuesday. 
Seven other airlines most of them regional carriers also grounded their Scottish flights.
In Edinburgh, meanwhile, several hundred passengers faced either a patient wait or overnight stays in the city.
"I've been told I'll get home tomorrow, but who knows," said Kgeld Westh, an architect from Copenhagen. He was 
heading to a hotel in Edinburgh after his flight was canceled.
Among the crowds at the airport were soccer fans heading to Dublin for the international match between Scotland 
and Ireland.
"If all else fails we'll make our way by train and ferry," said Gary Clark, from Hamilton near Glasgow wearing a kilt 
and a Scotland shirt.
The main international body representing carriers, the International Air Transport Association, complained to the 
British government about the way it had handled the issue, saying it should have had Cessna planes ready to carry 
out tests, instead of relying on the weather service. British Airways said it sent its own verification flight, an Airbus 
A320, to Scotland late Tuesday to assess the risk.
The Grimsvotn volcano began erupting on Saturday, sending clouds of ash high into the air. The amount of ash 
spewing from the volcano tapered off dramatically on Tuesday, however, said Elin Jonasdottir, a forecaster at 
Iceland's meteorological office. She added that because the plume has decreased in height it's now at about 5,000 
meters (16,000 feet) the ash won't travel far and will most likely fall to the ground near its source.
U.K. air traffic control company NATS said that the ash cloud is expected to clear British airspace early Wednesday. 
Earlier there were fears that the ash cloud might also affect France, but French civil aviation authority DGAC on 
Tuesday sounded an optimistic note.
"Forecasts for the next few days are promising, French airspace should be affected only very marginally by the 
volcanic ash," it said in a statement. "No closure of French airspace is currently envisioned."
U.K. airspace was not closed, but some airlines would rather not take risks and were willing to follow official advice. 
EasyJet had 113 cancelations Tuesday in and out of Scotland, Newcastle and Northern Ireland. British Airways 
grounded 92 flights in total, and Dutch airline KLM canceled a total of 42 flights. Declan Kearney, spokesman for 
Aer Lingus, said it had canceled 22 flights between Ireland and Scotland.
"We take the advice given to us," he said. "We have no reason to question the advice being given to us by the 
aviation authorities at this time. We need to accept what the experts in this area are telling us."
The ash cloud forced President Barack Obama to shorten a visit to Ireland on Monday, and has raised fears of a 
repeat of last year's huge travel disruptions in Europe.
Last year, European aviation authorities closed vast swaths of European airspace as soon as they detected the 
presence of even a small amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. This year, they are trying a more sophisticated 
approach.
Aviation authorities will give airlines information detailed information about the location and density of ash clouds. 
Any airline that wants to fly through the ash cloud can do so, if it can convince its own national aviation regulators it 
is safe.
Flights canceled as volcanic ash touches Scotland
The closures are already affecting travel plans across Europe. Officials at Spanish soccer team Barcelona, which 
plans to travel to London on Thursday for Saturday's Champions League final against Manchester United at 
Wembley Stadium, say they are monitoring the ash cloud disruption and could change their departure date.
In Ireland, a couple who were due to fly to Edinburgh for a friend's wedding were told their flight had been canceled. 
Anne and Damien Farrell decided on the spot to reclaim the car they'd just parked in Dublin Airport's long-term 
parking lot, drive the 100 miles (160 kilometers) north to Belfast, and take the ferry to the Scottish port of Stranraer.
"Fortunately we have a day of lead-in time before the wedding party gets going, otherwise we'd be up a certain 
creek without a paddle," said Damien Farrell, 29.

All flights bar one are set to operate from Irish airports today as the risk from the Icelandic ash cloud eases for now.
Aer Lingus says it expects to operate all its departures, while Ryanair says it will be cancelling just one service, 
from Dublin to Berlin.
All of the country's airports will remain open today, the Irish Aviation Authority says, and there will be no restrictions 
in Irish airspace.
The ash cloud from the Grimsvotn volcano has drifted over Germany today, causing the closure of airports at 
Hamburg and Bremen. Berlin will also be affected from later this morning. Parts of Scandinavia are also facing a 
risk of disruption. Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based agency responsible for some of the world's busiest air corridors, 
said the ash cloud may affect parts of Denmark, southern Norway and southwest Sweden today. "Currently there is 
no forecast when the restriction will be lifted," Hamburg airport said on its website. German airline Lufthansa 
advised passengers that tickets for cancelled flights within Germany could be exchanged for rail vouchers. Dutch 
airline KLM says it has cancelled 19 flights today. The ash has caused far fewer problems than last year, when 
more than 10m people were hit by a six-day European airspace shutdown after another Icelandic volcano erupted. 
Airlines put their revenue loss then at USD 1.7bn. But the latest episode has exposed disarray among the people 
who decide on aviation safety as they try to apply new rules to avoid another mass shutdown. Budget airline 
Ryanair was again vocal yesterday in its criticism, and airline association IATA said more coordination was needed. 
In Iceland, volcano experts had good news for airlines as they said the eruption was petering out. President Olafur 
Grimsson told the BBC: "The volcano seems to be calming down. The eruption is gradually being diminished and 
the ash cloud is definitely smaller than it has been." Passengers planning to travel by air over the coming days are 
advised to regularly check their airline's website and the IAA website in advance of going to the airport. Passengers

All flights bar one are set to operate from Irish airports today as the risk from the Icelandic ash cloud eases for now.
Aer Lingus says it expects to operate all its departures, while Ryanair says it will be cancelling just one service, 
from Dublin to Berlin.
All of the country's airports will remain open today, the Irish Aviation Authority says, and there will be no restrictions 
in Irish airspace.
The ash cloud from the Grimsvotn volcano has drifted over Germany today, causing the closure of airports at 
Hamburg and Bremen. Berlin will also be affected from later this morning. Parts of Scandinavia are also facing a 
risk of disruption. Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based agency responsible for some of the world's busiest air corridors, 
said the ash cloud may affect parts of Denmark, southern Norway and southwest Sweden today. "Currently there is 
no forecast when the restriction will be lifted," Hamburg airport said on its website. German airline Lufthansa 
advised passengers that tickets for cancelled flights within Germany could be exchanged for rail vouchers. Dutch 
airline KLM says it has cancelled 19 flights today. The ash has caused far fewer problems than last year, when 
more than 10m people were hit by a six-day European airspace shutdown after another Icelandic volcano erupted. 
Airlines put their revenue loss then at USD 1.7bn. But the latest episode has exposed disarray among the people 
who decide on aviation safety as they try to apply new rules to avoid another mass shutdown. Budget airline 
Ryanair was again vocal yesterday in its criticism, and airline association IATA said more coordination was needed. 
In Iceland, volcano experts had good news for airlines as they said the eruption was petering out. President Olafur 
Grimsson told the BBC: "The volcano seems to be calming down. The eruption is gradually being diminished and 
the ash cloud is definitely smaller than it has been." Passengers planning to travel by air over the coming days are 
advised to regularly check their airline's website and the IAA website in advance of going to the airport. Passengers

Thick cloud coming from an erupting volcano in Iceland has covered some parts of the UK, Scotland up to northern 
England Tuesday, disrupting air traffic and leaving thousands of passengers stranded in several airports.
In Germany, air traffic control officials said they would close airports at Bremen and Hamburm from 5am and 6am, 
and warned that would close Berlin airport too if the situation needs to.
Ryanair issued a warning to customers awaiting flights from Germany that their travel may be disrupted. The carrier 
said it cancelled all flights to and from Bremen, Lubeck and Magdeburg airports until 2pm local German time.
Chaos was the order of the day as hundreds of flights across the UK were cancelled due to concerns coming from 
the ash cloud.
But before the situation improves, volcanologists and weather forecasters warned that the cloud is heading over the 
northern territories which could force more flight cancellations and more miseries for travelers to and from Europe.
Other carriers like Easyjet has advised passengers traveling from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, Amsterdam, 
Dortmund, Berlin, Copenhagen or Hamburg to call their office first before going to the airport and check if their 
flights are not cancelled.
British Airways has cancelled two flights from Hamburg.
On Tuesday, flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh International airports, as well as Dundee, were cancelled, with 
severe disruptions hitting other Scottish airports. The Newcaslte International airport was the hardest hit of the ash 
cloud.

Northern Europe which suffered a setback due air traffic disruption from Icelandic volcanic ash on Wednesday was 
provided with hope when experts said the eruption was rapidly dying down, a report said.
The ash from the Grimsvotn volcano has caused fewer problems than last year, when more than 10 million people 
suffered a six-day airspace shutdown in Europe after another Icelandic volcano, Eyjafjallajökull, erupted.
Scotland was hit hard when 500 flights were cancelled all over Europe out of the expected 29,000 that were 
scheduled to fly across the continent on Tuesday. Ryanair airline once again criticized the system and IATA 
(International Air Transport Association) asked for more coordination.
Iceland President Olafur Grimsson, in a report, said the volcano is dying down and the ash clouds were diminishing.
Eurocontrol, the European organization looking into the safety of air navigation, said on Wednesday the ash clouds 
may still affect southern Norway, Southwest Sweden and parts of Denmark and flights will be coordinated 
accordingly.
Air traffic in Scotland and northern England was the main victim of volcanic ash on Monday. British air traffic board 
NATS (National Air Traffic Services) assured no ash was expected over Britain on Wednesday.
Among those affected were US President Barrack Obama, who left for Britain late on Monday and ahead of 
schedule.
The Barcelona soccer team also flew to London early for Saturday's Champions League final against Manchester 
United.
Grimsvotn eruption dying out but ash still persists over Europe
The volcano, Grimsvotn, erupted on Saturday and smoke reached as high as 20 km. The eruption has been the 
most powerful since 1873 and stronger than Eyjafjallajökull which caused havoc last year.

The            Icelandic ash cloud left British airspace early on Wednesday morning according to the air traffic 
controller NATS.
Airspace above the U.K. is expected to            remain clear until at least 1900 GMT as high-density volcanic ash 
dissipates. Domestic flights are expected to resume as airlines recover from yesterday's disruption. 
But European flights will still be subjected to cancellations as ash from the Grimsvotn volcano drifts over northern 
Germany.
Lufthansa said it expects to cancel about 150 flights today due to concerns about the ash cloud.
Hamburg and Bremen airports cancelled takeoffs and landings this morning, and German authorities said Berlin 
terminals could also face closure from 1000 GMT. Parts of Scandinavia are also facing a risk of disruption.
British Airways cancelled three flights between London Heathrow and Hamburg, while easyJet called off scheduled 
flights between London and Copenhagen and advised passengers flying from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle and 
some European airports to check their flight status before travelling.
KLM, the Dutch airline, cancelled departures from Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Aberdeen all bound for 
Amsterdam, along with a number of flights across the continent, and three Eastern Airways flights were grounded.
Ryanair ruled out all scheduled transfers to and from Bremen, Lubeck and Magdeburg airports before 2pm CET, 
but Flybe said it expected to operate normally.
Meanwhile, the Met Office said ash might return to affect much of the country on Friday.

"On Friday, at between 35,000 and 55,000ft, there could be a risk of a high concentration of ash covering most of 
the UK," a spokesman said.
Disruption
Grimsvotn volcano erupted on Saturday and smoke soared as high as 12 miles into the sky. The eruption is its most 
powerful since 1873 and stronger than the volcano that caused trouble last year.
An ash cloud from the eruption forced the cancellation of            500 European flights on Tuesday, with British 
airspace hardest hit.
Among travellers affected were U.S. President Barack Obama, who left Ireland for Britain late on Monday ahead of 
schedule.
The            Barcelona soccer team flew to London early for Saturday's Champions League final against Manchester 
United.
Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based agency responsible for some of the world's busiest air corridors, said the ash cloud 
may affect parts of Denmark, southern Norway and southwest Sweden today.
"Currently there is no forecast when the restriction will be lifted," Hamburg airport said on its website. 
The ash has caused far fewer problems than last year, when more than ten million people were hit by a six-day 
European airspace shutdown after another Icelandic volcano erupted.

(RTTNews) - Airports in Germany reopened on Wednesday after ash cloud from an erupting Icelandic volcano 
dissipated.
German media reports quoting air traffic control said concentration of airborne ash was no longer critical. The 
activity at Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano, which erupted at the weekend, appears to have stopped.
Hazardous ash clouds forced the airports to temporarily close earlier in the day, resulting in flight cancellations.
Bremen and Hamburg airports reopened after being closed for most of Wednesday morning, while the airspace 
over Berlin was scheduled to reopen in the afternoon.
Earlier, a spokesman for Lufthansa said it anticipated around 150 flight cancellations, affecting Hamburg, Bremen 
and Berlin airports as well as north-bound flights from Stuttgart. Germany's largest air carrier operates around 2,000 
flights daily.
British Airways, as well as budget carriers easyJet and Ryanair canceled flights bound for or departing from 
affected German airports.
The Brussels-based association of European air traffic controllers, Eurocontrol, said about 700 flights were 
canceled in Germany on Wednesday. It said there were no flight restrictions elsewhere in Europe.
Around 20 flights were canceled at the Swedish airport of Landvetter, the main airport in western Sweden.
Iceland's most active volcano created a plume about 20 kilometers high when it erupted on Saturday.
On Tuesday, the ash cloud resulted in the cancellation of some 500 flights in Europe, mainly in British airspace.
Passengers were advised to regularly check websites operated by airlines, travel operators or airports they were 
leaving from.

A ROW between airlines and aviation officials broke out yesterday over fears the volcanic ash cloud blowing in from 
Iceland could cause a repeat of last summer's mass flight disruptions.
Planes due to fly to and from Scotland were grounded yesterday, including flights from London airports.
However, late last night, UK air traffic control service NATS said flights would not be affected from today.
Irish carrier Ryanair had blasted the UK Met Office and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for the creation of "red 
zone" areas designated as unsafe for aircraft to fly in.
"There is no safety threat to aircraft in this mythical 'red zone', which is another misguided invention by the UK Met 
Office and the Civil Aviation Authority," the airline said.
The operator was amongst several carriers in the UK to cancel flights, including BA, easyJet and KLM.
Shares of airline firms slumped on the news, as well as on fears of further disruption.
Ryanair had conducted a test flight in Scottish airspace yesterday morning.
The airline claimed it had flown within the red zone and had found "no evidence of volcanic ash".
But authorities last night questioned the accuracy of Ryanair's test flight.
AIRLINES HIT AS ASH CLOUD REACHES UK AVIATION
"Radar tracking has shown that at no point did the Ryanair flight fly directly through the notified area of high ash 
contamination over Scotland so it is unsurprising that it found no ash," a department for transport spokesperson 
said.
Transport secretary Philip Hammond rushed to calm fears the impact of the eruption would cause a repeat of last 
year's travel chaos.
"We are in a much better place this year because we have worked with airlines and regulators to build a regime that 
puts safety first, but with far more flexibility," he said.

The ash cloud from the volcanic eruption in Iceland forced the cancellation of about 500 flights in and out of 
Scotland and some other parts of northern Europe on Tuesday but officials remained hopeful of avoiding the chaos 
that caused by an ash cloud last year.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency, said most cancellations came after airspace was closed because ash 
was detected at high enough levels potentially to damage aircraft.
The number of flights affected was 10 per cent of the total number that used UK airspace on Tuesday. Eurocontrol 
said its 39 member states on average handled just fewer than 30,000 flights daily. Airlines including British Airways, 
EasyJet, KLM and Ryanair had to cancel flights in and out of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, affecting 
thousands of passengers.
"We do not at this point anticipate a widespread airspace closure," said Siim Kallas, Europe's transport 
commissioner.
Mr Kallas said the bloc had learnt from the calamity that followed last year's Icelandic eruption, in which outdated 
procedures and computer models led to a blanket closure of airspace across the continent. Europe was now 
equipped to take a "gradual response rather than a one-size-fits-all approach".
Philip Hammond, transport secretary, said services "should be returning to normal" this morning.
A forecast by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, run by the UK's Met Office, showed that the high-density ash cloud 
was moving east towards Denmark, Norway and Sweden and could spread to parts of northern Germany and the 
Netherlands today.
German authorities said on Tuesday night that some airspace would be closed this morning, affecting mostly 
Bremen and Hamburg, and possibly Berlin and Hanover.
Hundreds of flights cancelled in ash cloud alert
The Met Office said its forecasts for the rest of the week showed that only low-density ash clouds, in which most 
aircraft are cleared to operate, would affect parts of Europe but cautioned that forecasts beyond 24 hours had "no 
certainty".
Data from the Grimsvotn volcano suggested the eruption was diminishing.
European guidelines, introduced after last year's ash cloud, have made officials hopeful of avoiding a repeat of the 
chaos. The decision on whether to fly is left to individual airlines.
But there was some criticism from the industry at the response. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, 
challenged the ban on flights in and out of Scotland by operating what it called a "verification flight", claiming it had 
not encountered any ash.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said it was "bureaucratic nonsense" that had led regulators to stop the 
airline operating Scottish flights.
Ryanair's claims were dismissed by the Civil Aviation Authority, which said the aircraft had been tracked on radar 
and it had not flown near the high concentrations of ash.
Iata, the airline trade body, criticised the government for not having its test aircraft ready to monitor the ash cloud.
One government official admitted the aircraft was grounded but said it had access to data from satellites, weather 
balloons, radar systems and lasers.
British Airways also said it had sent up a verification flight on Tuesday night.

Airlines clashed with regulators and pilots Tuesday as passengers braced themselves for days of uncertainty and 
chaos caused by a volcanic ash cloud being blown across the British Isles.
Britain's weather service said the ash from Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano had moved over parts of Scotland, 
prompting air regulators to warn airlines that they had to seek permission to fly to and from the area. Hundreds of 
flights were canceled in Britain and Ireland.
Spokesman Barry Grommett said volcanic ash had been detected on the ground in Scotland, and a specialist laser 
based on the Shetland Islands northeast of the Scottish mainland had also detected ash in the atmosphere.
"All the data we are receiving confirms our forecasts, that there is high-density ash over Scotland," Grommett said. 
Experts say that particles in the ash could stall jet engines and sandblast planes' windows.
Irish budget airline Ryanair immediately challenged the results. It said it had sent its own airplane into Scottish 
airspace and found no ash in the atmosphere.
"Exactly as we predicted, we encountered absolutely no problems, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary told 
The Associated Press. "There's no cloud over Scotland. There's no dusting of ash on the airframe or the wings. The 
airspace over Scotland should never have been restricted in the first place."
The main international body representing carriers, the International Air Transport Association, complained to the 
British government about the way it had handled the issue, saying it should have had Cessna planes ready to carry 
out tests, instead of relying on the weather service.
But other airlines were more willing to follow official advice. Declan Kearney, spokesman for Aer Lingus, said it had 
canceled 20 flights between Ireland and Scotland.
"We take the advice given to us," he said. "We have no reason to question the advice being given to us by the 
aviation authorities at this time. We need to accept what the experts in this area are telling us."
Official: Ash will cancel up to 500 flights
The European Cockpit Association that represents pilots warned airlines against allowing their planes to venture 
into areas with even moderate ash concentrations.
The association "cannot accept under any circumstances any flights into the red zone, even if these are approved 
by airlines," said secretary general Philip von Schoppenthau.
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said the high-density ash was in the skies above parts of Scotland by late Tuesday 
morning, and that it was likely to affect northern England and Northern Ireland in the afternoon.
The Grimsvotn volcano began erupting on Saturday, sending clouds of ash high into the air that have then been 
carried toward the British Isles on the wind.
Brian Flynn, head of network operations at Eurocontrol said between 200 and 250 flights had already been 
canceled on Tuesday, and warned that up 500 flights could be affected.
British Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said there had also been some "modest delays" to flights crossing the 
Atlantic, as aircraft need to avoid areas of high ash concentration. He added that there may be more delays later 
this week.
The ash cloud forced President Barack Obama to shorten a visit to Ireland on Monday, and has raised fears of a 
repeat of huge travel disruptions in Europe last year when emissions from another of Iceland's volcanos, 
Eyjafjallajokull, stranded millions of passengers.
Last year, European aviation authorities closed vast swaths of European airspace as soon as they detected the 
presence of even a small amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. This year, they are trying a more sophisticated 
approach.
Aviation authorities will give airlines information detailed information about the location and density of ash clouds. 
Any airline that wants to fly through the ash cloud can do so, if they can convince their own national aviation 
regulators it is safe to do so.
Other airlines decided not to take any risks. British Airways suspended all its flights for Tuesday morning between 
London and Scotland, while Dutch carrier KLM and budget airline easyJet canceled flights to and from Scotland and 
northern England at the same time. Three domestic airlines also announced flight disruptions.
The closures are already affecting travel plans, In Ireland, a couple who were due to fly to Edinburgh for a friend's 
wedding were told their flight had been canceled. Anne and Damien Farrell decided on the spot to reclaim the car 
they'd just parked in Dublin Airport's long-term parking lot, drive the 100 miles (160 kilometers) north to Belfast, and 
take the ferry to the Scottish port of Stranraer.
"Fortunately we have a day of lead-in time before the wedding party gets going, otherwise we'd be up a certain 
creek without a paddle," said Damien Farrell, 29.
Norwegian airport operator Avinor said the ash cloud that swept over southwestern Norway earlier Tuesday has 
now moved away from the coast and no longer affects the airports in Stavanger and Karmoey. However, it said the 
ash is expected to return to southern Norway in the afternoon.
In Brussels, European Union transportation commissioner Siim Kallas said passengers and airlines were facing "a 
very challenging week."
"Although we are partly dependent on the weather and the pattern of ash dispersion, we do not at this stage 
anticipate the widespread airspace closures and the prolonged disruption we saw last year," Kallas said.
Eurocontrol said the ash was not expected to affect trans-Atlantic flights because it was mostly north of the usual 
routes and was not reaching above 35,000 feet. Airliners crossing the Atlantic usually cruise at altitudes above 
37,000 feet, where the thin air density reduces fuel burn.
Official: Ash will cancel up to 500 flights
Spanish airport authority Aena said two flights to the UK were canceled Tuesday morning. Spanish soccer team 
Barcelona plans to travel to London on Thursday for Saturday's Champions League final against Manchester 
United at Wembley Stadium, though club officials say they are monitoring the ash cloud disruption and could 
change their departure date.
Last year, Barcelona traveled to Italy by bus for a Champions League semifinal at Inter Milan because of the 
closure of European airspace.

Ryanair today flew a plane through Scottish airspace regulators say has "high ash concentration" in a bid to show 
there was no danger from a volcanic eruption in Iceland.
Ryanair operated a one-hour verification flight at 41,000 feet this morning from Glasgow to Inverness to Aberdeen 
and on to Edinburgh through areas it said the Civil Aviation Authority had designated a "red zone" of high ash 
concentration.
"There was no visible volcanic ash cloud or any other presence of volcanic ash and the post flight inspection 
revealed no evidence of volcanic ash on the airframe, wings or engines," the statement said.
"Ryanair's verification flight this morning also confirms that the 'red zone' over Scotland is non-existent," it said. 
About 250 flights to northern Britain were cancelled over concerns about the ash cloud spewing from an Icelandic

low-cost airline, is a vocal critic of regulators' decision to close skies over Europe during an eruption last year after it 
was forced to cancel almost 10,000 flights in April and May at a cost of 30 million euros. Ryanair said it had

Office last night shut the skies over Scotland when this morning we have now confirmed there is no volcanic ash

south of Iceland there is almost no presence of volcanic ash in the atmosphere because it is dissipating."

Ryanair today flew a plane through Scottish airspace regulators say has "high ash concentration" in a bid to show 
there was no danger from a volcanic eruption in Iceland.
Ryanair operated a one-hour verification flight at 41,000 feet this morning from Glasgow to Inverness to Aberdeen 
and on to Edinburgh through areas it said the Civil Aviation Authority had designated a "red zone" of high ash 
concentration.
"There was no visible volcanic ash cloud or any other presence of volcanic ash and the post flight inspection 
revealed no evidence of volcanic ash on the airframe, wings or engines," the statement said.
"Ryanair's verification flight this morning also confirms that the 'red zone' over Scotland is non-existent," it said. 
About 250 flights to northern Britain were cancelled over concerns about the ash cloud spewing from an Icelandic 
volcano, but British and Irish officials dismissed fears of a mass shutdown of airspace. Ryanair, Europe's largest

Ryanair is to lodge a protest over being forced to cancel flights to Scotland because of the ash cloud spreading 
from Iceland.
The airline said it had been told by the Irish Aviation Authority that it could not operate flights to Scottish airports 
until at least 1 p.m.
"Ryanair believe that there is no safety risk to aircraft on flights operating to and from Scotland and together with 
other airlines will be complaining to the Transport Minister and Regulatory Authorities about these latest and 
unnecessary cancellations," it said on its website.
The airline's pugnacious boss, Michael O'Leary, was a vocal critic of the restrictions imposed on airlines last year 
out of concern that ash particles could cause engine problems. He had said yesterday that he was cautiously 
optimistic that regulators would not "balls it up again this year". Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have cancelled flights 
to Scotland this morning. Aer Lingus said that it had no choice but to cancel 12 flights to and from Edinburgh, 
Glasgow and Aberdeen. Ryanair has cancelled flights to and from Glasgow Prestwick, Edinburgh and Aberdeen 
until at least one o'clock. British Airways has also said it is not operating any flights between London and Scotland 
until lunchtime. Flybe and EasyJet have also cancelled flights. Authorities have backed more relaxed rules on flying 
through ash after being criticised for being too strict last year. The Grimsvotn volcano erupted on Saturday and 
smoke belched as high as 20 km into the sky. The eruption is the volcano's most powerful since 1873 and stronger 
than the volcano that caused trouble last year. But scientists say the type of ash being spat out is less easily 
dispersed and winds have been more favourable.

The ISEQ rose only slightly after yesterday's rout as Europe's continuing debt crisis kept buyers away.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 9.55 points to 2,918.81.
Global stock markets fell yesterday (May 23rd) following news that the rate of expansion of economic activity 
slowed sharply in May. The S and P 500 fell by 1.2pc, Euro Stoxx 50 by 2.1pc and FTSE 100 by 1.9pc. In China, 
the flash estimate of the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 51.1, a ten-month low. In the euro 
area, manufacturing and services PMIs both unexpectedly fell sharply, from 58 to 54.8 for manufacturing and from 
56.7 to 55.4 for services. The ISEQ fell by over 50 points.
Europe's policy options to manage Greece's debt crisis are narrowing fast with the European Central Bank and 
credit ratings agencies warning against even a voluntary debt restructuring and Athens highlighting the risk of an 
imminent default unless it gets more EU money. Moody's became the latest ratings agency on Tuesday to warn of a 
chain reaction of severe consequences for the 17-nation euro area if Greece were allowed to default next month, 
when it faces a 13.4 billion euro funding crunch. And Ireland and Portugal will be in the firing line, according to 
Moody's. European air traffic controllers said this morning that 252 flights had been cancelled as a volcanic ash 
cloud covered Scotland and Northern Ireland. Ryanair today flew a plane through Scottish airspace regulators say 
has "high ash concentration" in a bid to show there was no danger from a volcanic eruption in Iceland. Shares in the 
airline were flat at E3.36. Food group Greencore says its half year group operating profit inched 1.7pc higher to 
E27m compared to the same time last year. It said group sales of E442m for the six months to March 25 
represented a 7.9pc increase on the same time last year. The company said it was optimistic about its ability to 
drive growth and shareholder value in the months and years ahead. Greencore's shares fell 2c to E1.19.

The ISEQ managed only modest gains after Monday's rout as Europe's continuing debt crisis kept buyers away.
The index rose 15.77 points to 2,925.03.
Global stock markets fell yesterday (May 23rd) following news that the rate of expansion of economic activity 
slowed sharply in May. The S and P 500 fell by 1.2pc, Euro Stoxx 50 by 2.1pc and FTSE 100 by 1.9pc. In China, 
the flash estimate of the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 51.1, a ten-month low. In the euro 
area, manufacturing and services PMIs both unexpectedly fell sharply, from 58 to 54.8 for manufacturing and from 
56.7 to 55.4 for services. The ISEQ fell by over 50 points.
Europe's policy options to manage Greece's debt crisis are narrowing fast with the European Central Bank and 
credit ratings agencies warning against even a voluntary debt restructuring and Athens highlighting the risk of an 
imminent default unless it gets more EU money. Moody's became the latest ratings agency to warn of a chain 
reaction of severe consequences for the 17-nation euro area if Greece were allowed to default next month, when it 
faces a E13.4 billion funding crunch. European air traffic controllers said that 252 flights had been cancelled as a 
volcanic ash cloud covered Scotland and parts of the North of England. Ryanair has flown a plane through the 
Scottish airspace that regulators say has "high ash concentration" in a bid to show there was no danger from a 
volcanic eruption in Iceland. Shares in the airline were up 4c at E3.40 while Aer Lingus, who said only about 3pc of 
their services were affected, saw its shares rise 1c to E0.80. Food group Greencore says its half year group 
operating profit inched 1.7pc higher to E27m compared to the same time last year. It said group sales of E442m for 
the six months to March 25 represented a 7.9pc increase on the same time last year. The company said it was 
optimistic about its ability to drive growth and shareholder value in the months and years ahead. Greencore's

While the recent Icelandic volcano eruption is grounding flights across Europe,  one bold airline that flew a plane t 
through the ash cloud is calling for lighter restrictions.
Ryanair said that restrictions on airlines should be lifted after it successfully performed a "verification flight" though 
the thickest part of the volcanic ash cloud.
The flight 1 hour flight ascended to up to 41,000ft in Scottish airspace this morning.
''There was no visible volcanic ash cloud or any other presence of volcanic ash and the post-flight inspection 
revealed no evidence of volcanic ash on the airframe, wings or engines," the airline said.
Rynair is strongly objected to the disruption under orders from the Irish Aviation Authority .
''The absence of any volcanic ash in the atmosphere supports Ryanair's stated view that there is no safety threat to 
aircraft in this mythical 'red zone', which is another misguided invention by the UK Met Office and the CAA (Civil 
Aviation Authority).
''Ryanair has also received written confirmation from both its airframe and engine manufacturers that it is safe to 
operate in these so-called 'red zones' and, in any event, Ryanair's verification flight this morning also confirms that 
the 'red zone' over Scotland is non-existent.''
Iceland's airports were closed Sunday and transatlantic flights were being diverted around that country's airspace 
after a major volcanic eruption.
Iceland Volcano: Defiant airline flies through Grimsvotn ash cloud
The Grimsvotn volcano eruption is reminiscent of another eruption, of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland last 
year, which shut down European flights and left passengers stranded across the world.
But Ryanair insisted there was no basis for the flight cancellations.
"Ryanair believe that there is no safety risk to aircraft on fights operating to and from Scotland and, together with 
other airlines, will be complaining to the Transport Minister and regulatory authorities about these latest and 
unnecessary cancellations," a company spokesman said.
Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus have advised intending passengers to contact their airline or check the company

Ryanair has cancelled all flights to and from Scottish airports and been forced to back down over claims that the 
ash cloud has had no effect on its aircraft.
More than 200 U.K. flights were cancelled today as the ash cloud from Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano disrupted 
services across Europe.
The Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, earlier claimed that there was "no volcanic ash" and that "the sky should be 
immediately re-opened and planes allowed to fly".
He described information released by the Met Office in relation to the ash cloud as completely "duff".
Mr O'Leary said            Ryanair had undertaken a test flight and flown at 41,000 feet for an hour and a half over       
     Scotland landing at Prestwick and found no evidence of any volcanic ash material whatsoever. No dust or cloud 
was found on the airframe, the engine or the wings - not even the lowest level of ash was found.
However it was forced into an embarrassing U-turn just hours later, after the Irish Aviation Authority directed the 
airline to cancel all Scottish flights.
Transport Secretary Philip Hammond has rubbished Mr O'Leary's claims.
Mr Hammond said the information he had seen regarding the Ryanair flight suggested it "did not actually fly in any 
areas" where ash was expected.
He said that a Loganair plane which flew today had "encountered some light ash".

   May 24, 2011 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
The ash cloud caused by the eruption of an Icelandic Volcano has become less intense and the worst of the 
outburst may be over, the Met Office has said.
The Grimsvotn volcano erupted on Saturday, sending out a giant ash plume which reached 12 miles into the 
atmosphere.
Concerns about the impact of the ash cloud on jet engines led air traffic controllers to cancel over 250 flights across 
Europe today.
           British Airways has cancelled all remaining flights today to and from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle. 
While a number of other airlines have also followed suit.
But the Met Office has indicated that the worst may now be over. Meteorologist Halldor Bjornsson said radar 
images have shown the ash plume was now down to three miles or less.
Seismic data measuring eruptions also showed a tailing off.
"It all fits in with the same picture that the worst of this eruption is over," he told            Reuters.
The ash currently being emitted by the volcano was not enough to drift to European airspace, he added. 
Bureaucratic turf war
But recent events have caused divisions            across Europe on how to decide whether airlines can fly near the 
ash cloud. 
Iceland volcano ash cloud: Worst may be over, Met Office says
Disagreements between civil aviation authorities has prevented Europe's controllers from applying the same rules 
to everyone, with Germany insisting on closing skies as a precaution where there are signs of significant ash, 
aviation sources said on Tuesday.
"Germany has been taking a tougher line than most of the other countries,"            a source familiar with the 
discussions said. 
So far weather maps show a paw-shaped "red" zone of Icelandic ash spreading down to Scotland but sparing 
Germany, after the Grimsvotn volcano erupted on Saturday.
Changes brought about after last year's eruption should have reduced disruption, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority 
says. 
Firstly, forecasters are providing information dividing airspace into three areas of concentration: low (up to two 
milligrams per cubic metre), medium (up to four milligrams) and high above that.
And a new UK-backed system would allow pilots to make most decisions on where to fly, as long as airlines have 
made a compelling safety case and prove their risk assessment methods.
However, Germany told pilots on Tuesday that it would refuse to clear aircraft to fly through the medium or high 
zones except in emergency or under certain other conditions.
If airlines believe it is safe to fly above two milligrams, then they must provide hard scientific proof and not just rely 
on local safety audits, the German transport ministry said.
So far no airline has presented a safety case that would allow it to fly in the red-coded high zone, the CAA said.
Ireland's Ryanair took the matter into its own hands by sending its own plane up into the reported danger zone over 
Scotland on Tuesday, and said there was no visible ash.
The budget carrier has dismissed the red zone as a "myth".
Airlines affected by the ash cloud
The following airlines have announced flight cancellations:
           British Airways says "as a precaution" it will not be operating any flights to and from Glasgow, Edinburgh and 
Newcastle until 7pm.
           BMI is now listing 39 flights that have been cancelled. 
           Aer Lingus has cancelled a total of 20 flights to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen on Tuesday 
24th May.
           Flybe has cancelled 54 flights, to and from Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle and 
Cardiff.
           KLM has cancelled 34 flights scheduled to and from Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Newcastle.
Iceland volcano ash cloud: Worst may be over, Met Office says
           EasyJet has cancelled flights operating between 7am and 7pm today to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
Inverness and Aberdeen airports and also axed its flights to and from Newcastle between 1pm and 7pm. It hopes to 
operate services tonight from Newcastle to Alicante, from Alicante to Newcastle, from Luton to Aberdeen and from 
Aberdeen to Luton.
In its latest update, Nats, which provides air traffic control services for UK airspace, says volcanic ash will continue 
to affect some parts of the UK between 7pm today and 1am tomorrow. It says services from the following 
airports/aerodromes may be affected:
  Barra Glasgow Edinburgh Prestwick Newcastle Carlisle Durham Tees Valley Cumbernauld Tiree

European low-cost carrier to cut 80 jets
Fears on economic outlook and fuel
Body
Ryanair will cut capacity for the first time between November and April amid concerns about the economic outlook 
and high fuel prices. It also said it expected to report flat earnings this year.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it would ground 80 jets in its winter schedule, up from 
40 aircraft last winter, leaving it with a modest 4 per cent growth in capacity next financial year.
The airline will take delivery of 25 new aircraft over the coming months, bringing its total fleet to 292, but will not put 
them into service until the next summer schedule, starting in April 2012. For the first time, the company will also 
ground up to 55 aircraft in its existing fleet to offset the high cost of fuel, cutting capacity by as much as 5 per cent 
in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the measure was necessary to "protect" the carrier's profitability and would 
probably lead to redundancies among pilots, cabin crew and engineers.
"It's going to be tough even with higher fares to make the same amount of money again," he said, as the airline 
reported a 23 per cent rise in net profit to EUR374.6m ($525m) in the 12 months to the end of March, up from 
EUR305.3m in the same period a year earlier.
The earnings, which included an exceptional EUR26m hit from the cost of the disruption to air travel over Europe 
caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland last year, were slightly ahead of expectations. Adjusted earnings per 
share rose 25 per cent to EUR0.27 (EUR0.22) as revenues rose 21 per cent to EUR3.63bn (EUR2.99bn).
Ryanair's average fare rose 12 per cent to EUR39 as it carried 72.1m passengers, up 8 per cent.
Ryanair set to cut its winter capacity
Ryanair expects to carry 75m passengers this year, a rise of 3m, but said the higher fuel costs would soak up any 
earnings growth leaving full-year profits to March 2012 flat at about EUR400m.
The cautious outlook and concerns over the impact of the volcanic eruption over Iceland at the weekend, which 
weighed on all airline stocks on Monday, spooked investors, sending shares down 5 per cent to EUR3.37 in Dublin.
Like other airlines , Ryanair is facing pressure from rising fuel prices and the carrier expects its fuel bill to rise by 
EUR350m this year, after a jump of 37 per cent to EUR1.23bn in the 12 months to the end of March.
Ryanair has 90 per cent of its fuel requirements for this financial year hedged at an average of $82 per barrel.

Ryanair will cut overall capacity for the first time in its history this winter, amid concerns about the economic outlook 
and high fuel prices.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers said it would ground 80 jets in the winter schedule between 
November and April, up from 40 aircraft last winter, leaving it with 4 per cent growth in capacity in its financial year 
to the end of March 2012.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the measure was necessary to "protect" the carrier's profitability and would 
likely lead to redundancies.
"It's going to be tough even with higher fares to make the same amount of money again," he said, as the airline 
reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to EUR421m (£367m) in the 12 months to the end of March.
Earnings, which included an exceptional EUR26m hit from the cost of the disruption caused by the volcanic eruption 
in Iceland, were slightly ahead of expectations. Adjusted earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 27 cents (22 cents).
Ryanair's average fare rose 12 per cent to EUR39. The airline expects to carry 75m passengers this year, a rise of 
3m, but said higher fuel costs would soak up any earnings growth leaving full-year profits to March 2012 flat.
The cautious outlook and concerns over the impact of the volcanic eruption over Iceland at the weekend helped 
push shares in Ryanair down 22.1 cents to EUR3.36.
Ryanair to make first-ever capacity cut
  FT Comment 
Ryanair may not be producing the stellar top and bottom line growth it has done in the past but it still stands alone 
when it comes to financial performance. Mr O'Leary may shoot from the hip but management has always been 
conservative with guidance to investors. Consensus earnings per share forecasts for the current year may be 
trimmed slightly from 31 cents but even then that would only put it on a forward p/e of 11, still trailing rival EasyJet, 
which Ryanair beats hands down on costs. The airline looks to have been oversold on the latest volcanic scare.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) off 5.1 per cent, RENEWED concerns about the Eurozone 
debt crisis triggered a steep sell-off of Britain's top shares yesterday, led by commodity stocks, with some analysts 
and investors seeing little on the horizon to tempt investors back into the market.
The FTSE 100 index ended at its lowest closing level since 23 March, off 112.60 points, or 1.9 per cent, at 
5,835.89.
Fears of further sovereign debt crises were heightened after ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greece's debt by 
three notches on Friday to 'B+', and rival Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to "negative" from "stable" the 
following day.
Doubts about austerity measures in Spain added to the worries after the country's ruling Socialist party was 
defeated in regional elections.
"It's becoming less about Greece now and more about the contagion effect," Michael Hewson, market analyst at 
CMC Markets, said.
"There's also the fact that you've got these differences of opinion between ECB policymakers and European 
policymakers with respect to debt restructuring. The fact that it's being openly discussed obviously brings into doubt 
the solvency of the ECB because they are a big big holder of Greek bonds."
Miners were out of favour as copper prices fell, dented by the worries over Eurozone debt and weaker demand from 
top consumer China.
Fresh Eurozone debt fears see FTSE plunge to two-month low THE LONDON REPORT
Anglo American was the worst off, down 4.1 per cent, while Antofagasta shed 3.9 per cent after China's imports of 
refined copper declined more than 48 per cent year-on-year in April.
Integrated oil company stocks and banks also exerted heavy downward pressure on the blue-chip index, as 
investors rotated out of assets perceived as risky.
RISK OFF The FTSE 100 volatility index, a barometer of investor anxiety, hit a two-month peak yesterday, up 
nearly 16 per cent. The higher the index, the lower investors' appetite for risky assets such as stocks.
"I think there could be continued selling pressure as technically the FTSE and other European markets are starting 
to break down from their uptrends," said Lex van Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, which has 
$500m of assets under management.
"To see the markets down another five percent from here over the coming weeks would not surprise me." Travel 
stocks fell as a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland threatened to cause disruption to flights, with British Airways owner 
International Airlines Group (IAG) off 5.1 per cent, and tour operator TUI Travel 3.2 percent weaker. IAG shares 
were also undermined by a negative read-across from Ryanair, which blamed high fuel costs and a lack of growth 
in capacity on flat earnings. Its shares fell 5.3 per cent.
Elsewhere, British Land slipped 2.8 per cent as both Panmure Gordon and Peel Hunt downgraded their ratings for 
the blue chip real estate group following its full-year results.
Next was one of only two gainers on the FTSE 100 yesterday, up one per cent, recovering from declines made in 
the previous session, with traders citing optimism ahead of peer Marks & Spencer's full-year results today.
M&S slipped 0.5 per cent, outperforming the broader market.
Capita, was the other bright spot on the blue-chip index, up 1.6 per cent, as traders pointed to results from fellow 
outsourcer Mitie. Its shares rose five per cent.

Italy's benchmark equity index fell to its lowest level in more than four months in the wake of Standard & Poor's 
lowering the credit outlook on the country.
The FTSE MIB index of Italian stocks slid 3.3 per cent to 20,532.64 after the rating agency cut its long-term outlook 
to "negative" from "stable" over the weekend. Prompting S&P's move were the country's weak growth prospects 
and a rising risk that it may struggle to cut its debt pile.
Financial stocks were among the worst hit, with asset manager Mediolanum falling 2.8 per cent to EUR3.62 while 
banking group Intesa Sanpaolo lost 2.8 per cent to EUR1.69. UBI Banca slid 1.8 per cent to EUR5.22.
Fiat fell 3.4 per cent to EUR6.73 amid renewed concern about component shortages in the car industry after the 
earthquake in Japan.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.7 per cent to 1,116.52 as the broad sell-off led to losses at all but about half a dozen 
of the pan-European index's components.
Stocks in Athens recovered a little   after Friday's downgrade of Greek debt ratings by Fitch. The Athens General 
index slipped 1.3 per cent to 1,280.10.
George Papandreou, prime minister, began a cabinet meeting with more budget cuts on the agenda, to try to 
convince international lenders that Greece can come through the crisis without the need to restructure its debt 
payments.
However, the country's banks remained under pressure, with Piraeus Bank down 1.9 per cent to EUR1.01, Bank 
of Cyprus off 2.8 per cent to EUR2.10 and National Bank of Greece down 3 per cent at EUR4.53.
Ryanair   was among the biggest fallers on the Eurofirst 300, down 5.3 per cent to EUR3.36 after Michael O'Leary, 
chief executive, said that the Irish airline intended to improve yields and cut costs rather than focusing on growth.

FEARS OF a repeat of last summer's mass flight disruption were fuelled yesterday as airlines began cancelling 
flights in and out of Scotland in the wake of the volcanic ash cloud blowing in from Iceland.
BA, KLM, Easyjet, Flybe, Aer Lingus, Loganair and Eastern Airways have all cancelled services for today as the 
Met Office forecasted the plume from the Grimsvotn volcano will reach northern and western Scotland last night. It 
is expected to clip northern parts of Northern Ireland early today, and, if the volcanic emissions continue at the 
same rate, could reach western France and northern Spain on Thursday.
British Airways grounded all flights from London to Scotland until 2 p.m. today as a precautionary measure, a 
spokeswoman said.
Others cancelled some of their flights to and from Scotland today. Dutch airline operator KLM, part of Air France-
KLM, said last night it had cancelled 16 flights flying to and departing from Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and 
Newcastle. EasyJet cancelled flights to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen between 5 a.m. 
and 9 a.m. today, while Flybe cancelled flights to and from Aberdeen and Inverness. Glasgowbased Loganair 
cancelled 36 flights. Iceland's aviation authority reopened Keflavik airport late last night, but said it was impossible 
to know whether the island's international hub would remain open today. Authorities played down a repeat of last 
year, when ash from an Icelandic volcano caused some 100,000 flights to be cancelled, stranding 10m passengers 
and costing the industry an estimated $1.7bn (£1.1bn) in lost revenue. Transport secretary Philip Hammond said 
authorities could work with airlines to "enable them to fly around concentrations of ash rather than having to impose 
a blanket closure".
Nonetheless, airline shares fell, losing three to five per cent yesterday.

Italy's benchmark equity index fell to its lowest level in more than four months in the wake of Standard & Poor's 
lowering the credit outlook on the country.
The FTSE MIB index of Italian stocks slid 3.3 per cent to 20,532.64 after the rating agency cut its long-term credit 
outlook on the country from "stable" to "negative" over the weekend.
S&P's move was due to Italy's weak growth prospects and a rising risk that it may struggle to cut its debt pile.
Financial stocks were among the worst hit, with asset manager Mediolanum falling 2.8 per cent to EUR3.62 while 
banking group Intesa Sanpaolo lost 2.8 per cent to EUR1.69. UBI Banca slid 1.8 per cent to EUR5.22.
Carmaker Fiat fell 3.4 per cent to EUR6.73 after the company said it would bring forward some holidays at its Sevel 
plant, in part to account for component shortages due to interruptions in the supply chain caused by the March 
earthquake in Japan.
"Whether you think Italy is a relatively safe credit or not, they really don't have much margin for error if the market 
disagrees," said Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank.
Overall, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.7 per cent to 1,116.52 as the broad sell-off accounted for losses at all but 
about half a dozen of the pan-European index's components.
Stocks in Athens performed less badly than those in Milan as Greek markets recovered a little poise following 
Friday's debt downgrade by Fitch.
The Athens General index slipped 1.3 per cent to 1,280.10. George Papandreou began a cabinet meeting on 
further budget cuts and asset sales to try to convince international lenders that Athens can come through the crisis 
without the need to restructure its debt payments.

The country's banks remained under pressure, however, with Piraeus Bank down 1.9 per cent to EUR1.01, Bank 
of Cyprus off 2.8 per cent to EUR2.10 and National Bank of Greece down 3 per cent at EUR4.53.
Ryanair , the Irish airline, was among the biggest fallers on the Eurofirst 300 amid the latest volcanic ash cloud 
scare. Its stock fell 5.3 per cent to EUR3.36 after Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the airline was not focused 
on growth for the next couple of years as he intended to improve yields and cut costs.

FOR the first time in its 25 year history, Ryanair is cutting capacity. When winter 2011 rolls round the discount 
airline plans to ground 80 of its fleet including 50 new deliveries - even if the UK experiences an Indian summer that 
lasts until next February. A winter pullback on capacity is not unusual, but pulling more than a quarter of its fleet out 
of service will inevitably hit passenger numbers. Chief executive Michael O'Leary seems happy to guide down at 
the moment, predicting that passenger growth will be limited to four per cent. He also said profits would be flat as oil 
prices push operating costs up by 13 per cent, versus an average rise in fares of 12 per cent.
The caution over forecasts is countered by a bullish line from Ryanair on the eruption of Iceland's Grimsvotn 
volcano. The airline booked an exceptional charge of £26m from the cost of similar disruption last year after it had 
to ground around 10,000 flights, but O'Leary said yesterday he expected a much smaller impact this time round.
A share drop of six per cent yesterday was in line with the rest of the industry, but shares have fallen by more than 
ten per cent since the start of the year, and a wary outlook won't help.
O'Leary will be hoping that the smoke clears sooner rather than later, and that expansion plans aren't on the back 
burner for too long.

Airlines across Europe are braced for disruption this week as plumes of ash from Iceland's most active volcano 
moved towards UK airspace and led to flights today being cancelled.
The Civil Aviation Authority, the UK air safety regulator, said it hoped fresh Europe-wide measures - introduced 
after last year's eruption of another Icelandic volcano led to widespread airspace closures - would minimise -
disruption.
But as some of the biggest operators serving Scotland - including British Airways and KLM - cancelled flights in and 
out of the region this morning, the CAA warned that more widespread disruption was possible later in the week. It 
said airlines tended to plan using weather forecasts no more than six hours in advance.
Loganair, a small regional carrier that operates flights in and out of Scotland, was the first to cancel flights, with a 
grounding of almost all aircraft today .
Modelling by the UK's Meteorological Office, responsible for Europe-wide tracking of volcanic eruptions in Iceland, 
showed the ash cloud would cover most of Scotland at sufficiently high densities to stop aircraft flying at altitudes up 
to 20,000ft by this morning. A lower-density plume could reach the Irish republic, Northern Ireland, and northern 
England at about the same time, it said.
Most modern aircraft cruise above 20,000ft but pass through the lower levels at takeoff and landing.
Eurocontrol set up a crisis team after poor co-ordination was said to have exacerbated last year's crisis. It said that, 
"due to unstable meteorological conditions", it was impossible to identify for certain movements of the ash cloud 
more than 24 hours in advance.
European transport ministers played down fears of widespread disruption, after last year's eruption of 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano stranded about 10m passengers and cost airlines an estimated $1.7bn in compensation. 
Europe on alert over ash cloud
Airspace was closed over concerns that particles could damage jet engines, perhaps leading them to seize up. 
Some airlines, including Ryanair, complained that authorities were excessively cautious.
Michael O'Leary, Ryan-air chief executive, said the new measures were likely to mitigate ash cloud effects. "There 
will be a lot fewer problems this week," he said.
In Brussels, European Commission officials were co-ordinating with flight controllers, airlines and airports across 
the continent to review the situation.
Scientists said the eruption of the Grímsvötn volcano at the weekend might have been larger than last year's 
eruption but conditions differed. "It is not likely to be anything on the scale that was produced last year," said Pall 
Einarsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland.

Ryanair shares fall over plans to ground 80 jets

Ryanair shares fell Monday after Europe's leading budget airline said it would ground 80 aircraft this winter and 
suffer reduced passenger traffic for the first time in its history.
Ryanair announced strong full-year results Monday including 23 percent growth in its net profit. But the Dublin-
based airline said weak winter demand meant it would cost less to ground 80 jets more than a quarter of its fleet 
than to operate them at a loss from October to March.
Ryanair said the seasonal grounding would mean the airline carries 4 percent fewer passengers than in the 
previous winter, the first such drop since Ryanair's creation in 1985.
For the full fiscal year Ryanair said it still plans to carry a record 75 million passengers, versus 72.1 million in the 
year up to March.
Previously, Ryanair has transferred aircraft from loss-making winter routes to growth markets in the Mediterranean, 
keeping winter groundings to a minimum and passenger numbers consistently on the rise.
But O'Leary told reporters Monday that its fleet of Boeing 737-800s was growing too fast, with 272 already in 
operation and approximately 40 more coming by the first half of 2012. He said Ryanair had secured discounted 
rates for 90 percent of its fuel needs through the end of the year, but those costs were still too high to justify 
keeping the full fleet airborne.
"Instead of running around trying to open up new bases and routes in November and December, we'll sit them on 
the ground. With higher oil prices it makes no sense," he said.
Ryanair led the Irish Stock Exchange lower Monday. Its shares fell as much as 8.5 percent before partly rebounding 
to (EURO)3.35 ($4.69), down 5.6 percent.
For the fiscal year ending in March, Ryanair reported net earnings of (EURO)374.6 million ($524 million) compared 
to (EURO)305.3 million for the 2010 fiscal year.
Ryanair shares fall over plans to ground 80 jets
Sales rose 21.5 percent to nearly (EURO)3.63 billion ($5.1 billion).
The 2011 net figure included an exceptional charge of (EURO)26.1 million ($36.5 million) related to the grounding 
of 14,000 Ryanair flights because of the Icelandic volcanic ash scare in April-May 2010.
Airline stocks across Europe were depressed Monday by news of another volcanic eruption in Iceland, although 
scientists were quick to caution that Sundays eruption was producing larger ash particules that are unlikely to 
remain airborne for long distances.

The main Dublin shares index fell sharply in line with world markets as fears over the lingering European debt crisis 
continued.
By 13:00, the index was down 43.49 points to 2,924.25.
Doubts about Europe's ability to manage its debt hammered markets today, knocking the single currency, driving up 
bond yields and dragging down equities in Europe and elsewhere. Wall Street looked set to join in the flight from 
risk. U.S. stock index futures pointed to losses at the open. Investors were digesting a block of bad news about the 
euro zone crisis, a political and fiscal struggle to bring the huge debt in peripheral economies to heel. Following a 
three-notch cut of Greek debt by Fitch Ratings on Friday, which pushed the country deeper into junk status, rival 
Standard and Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to "negative" from "stable" on Saturday. Markets have generally 
decoupled Italy from other parts of the euro zone periphery during the crisis, which has led to bailouts for Greece, 
Ireland and Portugal.
Ryanair has reported what brokers are calling "an excellent 2011 performance", with profit growth of 26pc on an 
adjusted net income basis to E400.7m. Key components included traffic growth of 8pc and yield growth of 12pc, 
with sector length up 10pc. Fuel costs increased by 37pc, while unit costs ex-fuel rose 3pc, or down 7pc on a 
sector-adjusted basis. Q4 yields rose c.7.5pc, limiting the net loss in the quarter to E40.9m (Davy: -E41.6m). 
Ancillary revenue for the year grew by 21pc. The balance sheet remains very strong, Davy said, with almost E3bn 
in cash and net debt of just E708m despite an E850m return to shareholders in the last three years. Ryanair has 
extended hedging for FY 2012 to 90pc at dollar 820 per tonne (from 80pc at dollar 800 per tonne) and expects the 
full-year fuel bill to increase by E350m. It will "tactically" ground 80 aircraft this winter (from 40 last winter) to reduce 
winter losses given its industry-leading low fixed cost base. Traffic will growth 4pc to 75m passenger but weighted

before taxes for the first quarter of 2011. Not surprisingly, trading conditions remain difficult for Readymix, 
especially in the Republic of Ireland. Revenues in the first quarter of 2011 fell 27pc year-on-year (yoy), due primarily 
to lower volumes across all products. The competitive environment means that selling prices across key product 
ranges remain under pressure. "Revenues are expected to continue to fall for the rest of the year although we 
expect the pace of decline to moderate through the second half. For FY 2011, we expect group revenues to decline 
by 15.5pc (Ireland -25pc, UK flat). The trading loss of E4.2m in Q1 is consistent with our FY 2011 forecast of a pre-

ranges remain under pressure. "Revenues are expected to continue to fall for the rest of the year although we 
expect the pace of decline to moderate through the second half. For FY 2011, we expect group revenues to decline 
by 15.5pc (Ireland -25pc, UK flat). The trading loss of E4.2m in Q1 is consistent with our FY 2011 forecast of a pre-
tax loss of E10.9m," said Davy.

The main Dublin shares index fell sharply in line with world markets as fears over the lingering European debt crisis 
continued.
The ISEQ slumped 58.48 points to 2,909.26.
Doubts about Europe's ability to manage its debt hammered markets today, knocking the single currency, driving up 
bond yields and dragging down equities in Europe and elsewhere. Wall Street also joined in the flight from risk as 
U.S. stock indices fell sharply at the open. Investors were digesting a block of bad news about the euro zone crisis, 
a political and fiscal struggle to bring the huge debt in peripheral economies to heel. Following a three-notch cut of 
Greek debt by Fitch Ratings on Friday, which pushed the country deeper into junk status, rival Standard and Poor's 
cut its outlook for Italy to "negative" from "stable" on Saturday. Markets have generally decoupled Italy from other 
parts of the euro zone periphery during the crisis, which has led to bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
Ryanair has reported what brokers are calling "an excellent 2011 performance", with profit growth of 26pc on an 
adjusted net income basis to E400.7m. Key components included traffic growth of 8pc and yield growth of 12pc, 
with sector length up 10pc. Fuel costs increased by 37pc, while unit costs ex-fuel rose 3pc, or down 7pc on a 
sector-adjusted basis. Q4 yields rose c.7.5pc, limiting the net loss in the quarter to E40.9m (Davy: -E41.6m). 
Ancillary revenue for the year grew by 21pc. The balance sheet remains very strong, Davy said, with almost E3bn 
in cash and net debt of just E708m despite an E850m return to shareholders in the last three years. Ryanair has 
extended hedging for FY 2012 to 90pc at dollar 820 per tonne (from 80pc at dollar 800 per tonne) and expects the 
full-year fuel bill to increase by E350m. It will "tactically" ground 80 aircraft this winter (from 40 last winter) to reduce

Highlight: Ryanair has said this morning that high fuel costs and a lack of growth in capacity would mean flat

Ryanair has said this morning that high fuel costs and a lack of growth in capacity will mean flat earnings in the 
coming year.
The Irish airline, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day, said it expected traffic growth to slow to 4 pc in 2012 
from 8 pc last year and that increases in average fares would be eaten up by higher fuel costs.
Longer, more lucrative routes and growth in France and Germany will help drive up fares, but this will be offset by 
higher costs and weakness in southern Europe and the Irish domestic market, CEO Michael O'Leary said.
The airline has this morning posted a 26 pc surge in net profit for 2011 to 401m euros, at the top end of the 
company's guidance and above the 382 m euro average forecast by analysts. "Higher fares will only help us to 
finance higher fuel and rising sector length related costs, and accordingly, we expect profit after tax for FY12 to be 
similar to the FY11 result of 400m euros," O'Leary said in a statement. Shares in Ryanair dropped after the 
statement, down 6.4 pc to 3.32 euros, as investors fretted over the company's outlook and news that another 
volcanic ash cloud from Iceland could disrupt European air travel this week. O'Leary said he hoped the latest ash 
cloud would be less problematic than the last year's when European airspace was closed for six days and 
transatlantic flights hit. "We can have some confidence there won't be any disruptions this year," he said in an 
interview with Sky. "At least I hope there won't. Johannes Braun, an analyst with Commerzbank said that while 
markets were concerned by the new volcanic eruption in Iceland, the company's outlook was more worrying. "The 
results were ok, but the focus is on the outlook. Given that Ryanair is already fuel hedged by 90 pc, the very 
cautious outlook came a little bit as a surprise," he added, saying Ryanair's net profit guidance for 2012 was around 
100m euros below his forecast. The airline has 90 pc of its 2012 fuel needs hedged at a cost of USD 820 per tonne, 
a level it said would give it an advantage over competitors. "We are certainly better hedged than our competitors, so 
it is an advantage," Deputy CEO Howard Millar said. Costs will increase 13 pc in 2012 but would have increased 
Ryanair profits lift by 26pc to E 401m Ryanair Profits
just 2 pc without rising fuel costs, Ryanair said. But Millar also warned it was difficult to see how Europe would 
emerge from its current economic problems. Traffic growth of 10 pc in the six months to end-September is expected 
to slow to four percent in the following six months. "We have concerns about some countries like Ireland and 
Greece, Spain and Portugal," Millar said. "It's difficult to predict beyond the near future." Demand for air travel is 
picking up after years of weakness, but the picture is clouded by an uncertain global economic recovery and 
growing fuel prices that have risen 40 pc from a year ago. High fuel prices have been putting low-cost rivals under 
severe pressure. Air Berlin posted a bigger loss than expected in the first quarter. British low-cost airline easyJet 
saw first-half losses almost double. However the European airline industry has seen a recovery in recent months 
with International Airlines Group, formed by the merger of BA and Iberia and Air France-KLM both reporting healthy 
operating profits. Ryanair said adjusted earnings per share were 27c, compared with a forecast by analysts of 26c.

The drop came despite a 26pc rise in the carrier's latest full year profits, also announced this morning, to 401m 
euros.
It shares have dropped by 16.5c to 338 after a statement with its results said that high fuel costs and a lack of 
growth in capacity will prevent a rise in earnings for the coming year.
It also said it expected traffic grwoth to slow to 4 pc in 2012 from 8 pc last year and that increases in average fares

European shares have fallen this morning on renewed worries about the euro zone's peripheral debt crisis, after 
Greece's credit ratings were cut further last Friday into "junk" territory and Italy's rating outlook was cut to negative.
Miners were among the losers as the price of copper and other metals fell on the back of strengthening dollar. 
Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto fell between 2 and 2.7 pc.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1 pc a sho9rt time ago at 1,125.27 points, dipping 
below its 50-day moving average, after falling 0.4 pc last week.
Standard and Poor's cut its rating outlook for Italy to negative from stable, citing weak growth prospects and 
increased risks it would fail to slash its debt mountain. Fitch Ratings downgraded Greece's credit rating to B-plus 
and put the country on rating watch negative. "It's more than Greece now. This is more a reflection of the inability of 
the EU to sort out anything, and that makes people worry beyond Greece," said Lothar Mentel, chief investment 
officer at Octopus Investments, which manages USD 4bn. For equities to pick up, Mentel said: "The EU would need 
to come forward with something clever, instead of just buying time. Or we would need to see the decline in 
commodity prices feed through to the real economy quite quickly, and I don't expect that to happen before the end 
of the summer." Low-cost airline Ryanair fell 8pc after it said high fuel cost and a lack of growth in capacity would 
mean flat earnings in the coming year. Around Europe this morning, the FTSE 100 is down 1.5pc in London, with 
the Dax off by 1.6pc in Frankfurt and and the CAC-40 also 1.6pc lower in Paris.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is notably lower in afternoon trading Monday, as European sovereign-debt worries 
persist with Fitch's downgrade of Greek debt and Standard & Poor's threat that it may cut Italy's credit rating. 
Unimpressive economic data from the region and falling U.S. index futures also weighed on the stocks.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chippers is declining 1.86 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is falling 1.35 percent.
The FTSE 100 index opened at 5,948 and has been in negative territory. The index is currently losing 1.58 percent.
International Consolidated Airlines is declining 3.7 percent, as concern about the impact of Iceland's volcanic 
eruption on air routes hurt airline stocks in the region. TUI Travel is falling 2.5 percent. Outside the main index, 
Ryanair is plunging 6.1 percent. The company issued a cautious outlook for 2012, despite reporting a rise in 2011 
profit.
British Land is declining 2.4 percent after reporting that its full year profit fell.
Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta, Kazakhmys and BHP Billiton are declining between 3.7 percent and 2.5 
percent.
MITIE Group is rising 4.4 percent outside the main index. The company reported a higher pre-tax profit for fiscal 
2011, driven by revenue and order growth.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX is declining 1.86 percent and the French CAC 40 is losing 1.84 percent. 
Switzerland's SMI is losing 1.31 percent.
In economic news, reports showed that private sector activity in May slowed in Germany and eurozone. Data 
released by Markit Economics and BME said the composite output index for Germany dropped to 56.4 in May from 
59.2 in April. This was the weakest reading in seven months.
Meanwhile, the Markit Flash Composite Output Index fell more than expected to 55.4 in May from 57.8 in April, 
while economists expected 57.4. The deceleration in the rate of growth, as measured by the fall in the index, was 
the largest since November 2008.
UK Market Retreats
Across Asia/Pacific, major markets retreated, as data revealed that growth in China's manufacturing sector eased 
to its lowest level in ten months. Survey results from Markit Economics showed that the flash manufacturing 
purchasing managers' index fell to 51.1 from 51.8 in April.
Australia's All Ordinaries declined 1.76 percent, China's Shanghai Composite Index plunged 2.90 percent and Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng fell 2.11 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 retreated 1.52 percent.
In the U.S., futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, the major averages moved to the 
downside going into the close, ending the session firmly in negative territory. The Dow and the Nasdaq dropped 0.7 
percent each and the S&P 500 slid 0.8 percent.
In the commodity space, crude for July delivery is sliding $2.50 to $97.60 per barrel, while June gold is adding $0.2 
to $1509.1 a troy ounce.

   May 23, 2011 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
Last year's Iceland ash cloud caused many Britons to check their travel insurance policies for an eventuality that 
few had previously considered.
And many were warned that trips and policies bought from April 2010 onwards would not be covered in the event of 
a volcanic eruption that affected travel plans.
So, few could have imagined that the industry would have to deal with a similar episode so soon after the first with 
forecasters warning that the plume from the Grimsvotn volcano could be blown to northern Scotland tomorrow, and 
the rest of Britain by Thursday.
The eruption couldn't have come at a worse time for the beleaguered travel industry still reeling from the ongoing 
unrest in the Middle East.
Commenting on the volcanic eruption in Iceland, Bob Atkinson, travel expert at travelsupermarket.com said:
"As news of the Icelandic volcano eruption hits, with it brings the same travel uncertainty as we experienced in April 
2010. At this stage, it is business as usual except for flights to and from Iceland. For those who have booked a trip 
to Iceland, check with your tour operator or airline for the latest travel information.
Check your travel insurance policy, look for natural disaster and weather related clauses and understand what is 
covered in the policy. This will cover for things such as loss of travel arrangements, cost of new travel arrangements 
and travel delay."
Britain's biggest insurer Aviva, formerly Norwich Union, is among those that previously paid out claims but now 
won't. Others include NatWest, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) , Churchill, Direct Line and More Than.
Iceland ash cloud 2011: Which insurance companies paid out last time?
According to thisismoney.co.uk, the following insurers won't cover for ash cloud eventualities: 
  Aviva  Axa (unless you buy its independent traveller policy)   Barclays  Churchill  EasyJet (Mondial)  Halifax and 
Lloyds Banking Group  Insure & Go  Mondial Assistance  More Than  Nationwide Building Society  Natwest (unless 
you are an Advantage Gold customer)  Ryanair (Axa)  Tesco  Thomas Cook (if you buy a policy independently)  
Thomson (Mondial)  Virgin Money  
And those that will:
  Columbus Direct: Cover for travel delay and abandonment. Direct Line: Costs for delays and abandonment. Direct 
Travel: Costs not covered by travel firms. HSBC/First Direct: Travel expenses and accommodation. John 
Lewis/Greenbee: Extra travel costs. Marks & Spencer Money: Travel expenses and accommodation. Saga: Up to 
£5,000 for unused travel and accommodation costs. Santander: Up to £100 for delays, and £5,000 for 
cancellations.  
Insurance firm,            Suresave Travel Insurance, is urging all passengers to check their insurance policies before 
travelling.
"At this stage, we don't know the extent of the damage, or how bad it will get," Suresave Travel Insurance 
underwriter, Graham Kingaby, said. "Not all travellers will be covered for such an event, so it is important that they 
check their policy before travelling," he added.

(RTTNews) - The European markets suffered heavy losses Monday, as Fitch's downgrade of Greek debt and 
Standard & Poor's threat that it may cut Italy's credit rating stoked fears about the region's sovereign debt problems.
Meanwhile, Eurozone private sector growth slowed to a 7-month low in May, data from Markit Economics showed 
Monday. National figures showed German and French private sector activity tailing off.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chippers unofficially lost 1.9 percent, with all components finishing in 
negative territory. The Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, fell 1.49 percent.
The German DAX slipped 1.85 percent and the French CAC 40 shed 2.1 percent. UK's FTSE 100 lost 1.7 percent 
and Switzerland's SMI declined 1.43 percent.
The variety of bad news has clearly pushed the German stock market into the red, according to Monika Rosen 
Head of Research in the UniCredit Private Banking division.
Commerzbank AG (CBK) lost almost 4 percent after the German lender announced a 5.3 billion euro share sale.
French lender Credit Agricole lost 2.86 percent after S&P downgraded its counterparty credit rating, citing 
"significant sensitivity" to Greek debt.
Intesa SanPaolo plunged 8.8 percent. Automokers BMW and Daimler lost 3 percent each.
Airlines were hurt by Ryanair's cautious yearly outlook reported a 23 percent rise in pre-tax profit for the year ended 
March 31. Ryanair lost 6 percent.
A volcanic eruption in Iceland may disrupt trans-Atlantic flights. Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa AG were

movement declined from last year. Shares fell 2.8 percent.
MITIE Group added 5 percent. The company reported a higher pre-tax profit for fiscal 2011, driven by revenue and 
order growth.
ThyssenKrupp shares were down 1.8 percent after a report in the Financial Times Deutschland said a deal to sell 
its Blohm and Voss shipyard to Abu Dhabi Mar may have hit a snag.
Meanwhile, solar stocks came under pressure after a study from the Berlin Academy of Sciences said the prospects 
for
Germany's solar industry are anything but sunny. Phoenix Solar lost 1.1 percent.
Siemens was kept on Goldman Sachs "conviction buy" list. Last week, a court ruled that Siemens must pay 
France's Areva NP 648 million euros plus interest payments after Siemens backed out of a joint venture to build 
nuclear power plants.
The pace of Eurozone private sector expansion decelerated to a 7-month low in May on slower growth in Germany 
and France. The latest data casts doubt over the ability of the largest eurozone nations to pull the peripheral 
economies out of an economic slowdown.
The preliminary or 'flash' Composite Output Index, reflecting the health of manufacturing and service sectors, fell 
more than expected to 55.4 in May from 57.8 in April, survey data published by Markit Economics showed Monday. 
The consensus forecast was a reading of 57.4.

Europe Braces For Fresh Round Of Volcanic Dust-Induced Flight Disruption
Europe Braces For Fresh Round Of Volcanic Dust-Induced Flight Disruption

(RTTNews) - A fresh aerial lockdown resulting from volcanic dust thrown up by the Icelandic volcano, similar to the 
one which paralyzed European flights last year, could cause further disruption to the continent's airline services, 
reports said on Monday.
Consequently, British Airways, Easyjet, Loganair, Eastern Airways, Aer Lingus and Flybe have canceled their 
Tuesday flights in and out of Scotland. A few trans-Atlantic flights too have been grounded.
The threat posed by the Icelandic ash resulted in US President Barack Obama cutting short his visit to Ireland in 
order to travel to London on the next leg of his European tour. As per the President's itinerary, he was to have left 
Dublin on Tuesday morning. According to White House deputy press secretary, Josh Earnest, the move to advance 
Obama's trip to Britain had been taken "due to a recent change in the trajectory in the plume of volcanic ash."
Britain's Met Office said in its forecast that the ash cloud will reach northern and western Scotland overnight, and 
will clip northern parts of Northern Ireland early on Tuesday. However, it is unlikely to affect England.
According to a Met Office spokesman, it was quite difficult to forecast the cloud's position since the weather 
systems were changing so rapidly.
Among Tuesday's flights canceled or suspended include KLM's services to and from Aberdeen, Glasgow and 
Edinburgh, as well as some to Newcastle, Flybe flights to and from Aberdeen and Inverness, and Aer Lingus flights 
between the Republic of Ireland and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Loganair has canceled 36 flights while 
Eastern Airways will not be operating any services in and out of Scotland.
BA though announced that it will not be operating any flights on the London-Scotland sector until 2:00 pm local time 
on Tuesday.
British Transport Secretary Philip Hammond has been quoted as saying by BBC that "most, if not all, flights into and 
out of Glasgow and Edinburgh and airports to the north will be stopped" Tuesday morning. Nonetheless he said 
services from Glasgow and Edinburgh are expected to resume by around noon and at remaining airports by 
Wednesday morning. Further he opined that any disruption to airline traffic later on in the week will be limited.
An Edinburgh Airport airport spokesman said in a statement that a disruption to several services was expected on 
Tuesday. "Only Ryanair is intending to operate a full service from Edinburgh Airport. Passengers should not travel 
to the airport without checking with their airline first regarding the status of their flight, " it said.
Europe Braces For Fresh Round Of Volcanic Dust-Induced Flight Disruption
The chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) expressed the hope that disruption to flights may not be as 
widespread as last year's. "We know so much more about the volcanoes. We have an improved model. We have 
better measuring equipment and we have better relationships with airlines so it should be much better but we're still 
at the hands of both the weather and the volcano; those are the two uncertainties," he said.
In April and later in May last, airline services across Europe were thrown into complete disarray and several 
thousand travelers stranded after an aerial lockdown was imposed in the wake of threat posed by volcanic dust 
from an Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull crater.

Ryanair Fiscal Year Profit Rises; Issues Cautious Outlook - Update
Ryanair Fiscal Year Profit Rises; Issues Cautious Outlook - Update

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Monday reported a 23 percent rise in pre-tax 
profit for the year ended March 31, as higher traffic and increased fares more than offset soaring fuel costs. 
However, the company issued a cautious outlook for the year ahead.
Pre-tax profit for the year advanced to 420.9 million euros ($591.39 million) from 341.0 million euros in the prior 
year.
Profit attributable to equityholders increased to 374.6 million euros or 25.14 euro cents per share from 305.3 million 
euros or 20.60 euro cents per share.
The Irish airline incurred exceptional items of 29.7 million pre-tax in 2011 related to airspace closure costs for the 
Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions. Exceptional items were 13.5 million euros in 2010 reflecting an impairment of 
shareholding in Aer Lingus.
Excluding exceptional items, earnings per share rose to 26.89 euro cents from 21.52 euro cents.
Operating revenues grew 21 percent to 3.63 billion euros from 2.99 billion euros in the previous year, as traffic grew 
8 percent and average fares rose 12 percent.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased 22 percent and load factor was up 1 percent to 83 percent.
Fuel costs increased 37 percent in the year primarily due to higher fuel prices and the increased number of hours 
flown.
Unit costs advanced 11 percent as a result of higher oil prices and a 10 percent increase in sector length.
The increase in oil prices and a 3 percent rise in unit costs excluding fuel led to a 20 percent increase in total 
operating expenses.
Further, the airline said that in order to stem the falling traffic, the Dublin airport monopoly should be broken up and 
replaced with competing terminals and airports, which would deliver competitive airport charges.
Looking ahead, the company expects profit after tax for fiscal 2012 to be similar to the adjusted figure of 400 million 
euros reported for fiscal 2011.
Ryanair Fiscal Year Profit Rises; Issues Cautious Outlook - Update
Traffic is expected to grow 4 percent with a growth of 10 percent in the first half and a drop of 4 percent in the 
second half.
"Since we have limited visibility on bookings, we remain concerned at the impact of the recession, austerity 
measures, and falling consumer confidence on fares," the company noted, adding that it still expects average fares 
to grow 12 percent.
Among peers, easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) early this month reported a wider loss for the six months ended March 31, hurt 
by rising fuel prices and higher passenger taxes. Revenues, however, grew 8 percent helped by strong 
performance in the U.K.
RYA.L closed Friday at 3.58 pence, down 0.0010 pence, on 2.57 million shares.
RYAAY settled at $30.02, down $0.46 or 1.51 percent, on 357,723 shares.

NO FRILLS airline Ryanair has seen its share price on the up since March, and with oil prices falling, the stock is 
finding further support. It is due to report figures today and the expectations are that passenger numbers have 
increased. Capital Spreads quotes 3.54p-3.58p.
Optimism has increased about tomorrow''s first quarter Marks and Spencer trading update, after last week's better 
than expected UK retail sales figures, which could well surprise to the upside due to warm April weather and the 
extended Easter break. CMC Markets offers a spread of 401.21p-402.21p.
The news of recovery in the London letting market and early prelets has helped lift the share price of Great Portland 
Estates by around 17 per cent this year. But that hasn't stopped short sellers from building positions against it, with 
the proportion of the company's shares on loan more than doubling from 3 to 6.5 per cent since December. Spread 
Co offers a spread of 419.5p-420.6p.
BP managed to finish last week on a brighter note with a broker upgrade and news that it recovered $1.1bn from 
the Japanese partner involved in the ill-fated Gulf of Mexico drilling project. Even if this is a drop in the ocean 
against a total claim estimated at $41bn, analysts seem supportive of the stock with bullish target prices in play. 
Even the seemingly imminent failure of the Rosneft deal is being perceived as a blessing in disguise. Current IG 
Index price is 465.5p-466.5p.
The hotly awaited IPO of Glencore International launched spectacularly last week with the first day's volume of 
business being more than ten times the volume of the second most traded equity in the FTSE 100. On Tuesday, 
Glencore International will start trading in the FTSE 100 and for one week existing account holders with 
WorldSpreads will be eligible to spread bet on this stock spread free.

TODAY 
  British Land , the UK's second-biggest property company, will follow a bullish run of real estate results with 
similarly strong growth in pre-tax profit, boosted by a sharp rise in underlying net asset values, writes Daniel 
Thomas .
The company is expected to report that net asset value per share - the key measure of its portfolio growth - has 
gained about a fifth to more than 560p, outperforming the benchmark IPD index.
It is expected to see particularly strong growth in its prime retail and London office assets, where it has benefited 
from strong occupier and investor demand, and to point to an increase in acquisition opportunities.
More details are expected of an agreement to let part of the "Cheesegrater" skyscraper in the City of London to 
Aon. British Land is also expected to reveal a modest growth in its full-year dividend.
  Eddie Stobart has been keen to add firepower to its engine, agreeing a £115m rights issue last week, writes Gill 
Plimmer .
The haulier has been recasting itself as a transport group by offering rail, air and sea freight as well as warehousing 
services. Stobart said the cash would enable it to develop its property portfolio, including Southend airport in Essex 
and Carlisle Lake District airport, where it is hoping to provide regular passenger services.
It also said the cash-raising would help it buy the remaining 50 per cent of Biomass, which supplies timber and low-
grade softwood to the new generation of minimum-carbon power plants.
The group is raising the money through about 77m new shares by a placing and open offer priced at 155p - a 
substantial premium to the current price. Analysts will be keen to hear more details of the group's plans.
Corporate Diary
Investec forecasts show pre-tax profits are expected to rise from £33.5m in 2011 to £40m in 2012, and £44.5m in 
2013.
  Ryanair  is expected to report full-year net income between EUR350m and EUR370m in the 12 months to the end 
of March, writes Mark Odell . Europe's largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers will add back about EUR30m 
of costs from the disruption to air travel over Europe caused by the Iceland volcanic eruption in 2010, giving a 
headline profit of between EUR380m and EUR400m.
Like other airlines, the Dublin-based carrier has taken a hit from the sharp rise in oil prices since last year and 
investors expect management to have to recover those costs through higher pricing.
Unlike most airlines, Ryanair insists it does not impose extra charges on passengers to offset high costs of fuel but 
it has introduced other levies, which rivals say is a way of disguising the clawback.
One of the key issues that could move the share price is any indication of whether management will use its strong 
cash flow to pay another special dividend, after a EUR500m pay-out last year, or place further aircraft orders.

  Burberry ' s full-year results are expected to add a touch of glitz to the gloomy retail sector, and analysts are 
expecting strong sales in China to push the luxury fashion label's profits to record highs, writes Claer Barrett .
Although the British brand is listed in the UK, its future success lies in Asia, and recent announcements have been 
dominated by its success in China. Burberry has seen its share price rise 34 per cent since it bought out its Chinese 
franchise partner in a £70m deal last September, bringing 50 stores under direct control.
The company estimates conversion of wholesale to retail sales will add £20m to annual operating profits. Assuming 
it hits this growth target, its premium rating to the rest of the retail sector seems assured.
Consensus forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits are £280m-£304m, up from the £215m pre-tax profit reported last 
year.
  Shares in Daily Mail & General Trust  have been steady since its March warning that regional print advertising 
had slumped in the first quarter , writes Tim Bradshaw  .
Confidence in the advertising market, which recovered strongly last year, has wavered since ITV warned of tougher 
trading ahead and the IPA/BDO Bellwether report found that more marketers were cutting their budgets than raising 
them.
"Consensus [forecasting] implies that all of the advertising that has left print since the onset of recession in 2008 will 
return," said analysts at HSBC in a recent note to clients. "We believe the trend in [the first half] contradicts this."
Retailers' recent rash of profit warnings might bode ill, as the sector is the largest single source of ad revenue, 
HSBC added.
However, only 8 per cent of DMGT's profits are now derived from its Northcliffe regional division, and Numis 
analysts concluded in March that its Associated national newspapers "continue to outperform in both advertising 
and circulation".
Cost savings continue at a projected rate of £25m at Associated this year, and a cover price rise has not been ruled 
out. Investors may also expect an update on the Daily Mail's iPad application, which was launched in April. Numis 
forecasts earnings of 52p for the full year, on revenues of £2.07bn.

AGGREKO Goldman Sachs rates the power rental company a "buy" and has added the firm to its conviction buy list 
with a raised target price of 2482p. The broker thinks now is the key time to invest as a result of the favourable 
pricing environment caused by power shortages in Japan, bolstering the firm's already strong position in a sector 
with high barriers to entry.
BOOKER JP Morgan rates the food wholesaler "overweight" and has raised its target price by 12p to 71p. The 
broker thinks the firm is well placed to outperform, despite a choppy UK economy. Booker's product mix continues 
to shift favourably alongside consumer spending habits, and JPM thinks it can continue delivering growth like the 52 
per cent rise in fresh produce seen last year.
RYANAIR Commerzbank rates the airline "hold" and has a target price of 400 cents (349p). The broker expects the 
airline to weather rising fuel costs, thanks to its 90 per cent fuel hedge, and predicts solid growth. It predicts a net 
profit of (EURO)386m when Ryanair reports full-year figures today, and will be looking for comments on longer-term 
development of unit costs.

The main Dublin shares index looked like it was heading for a four-day rally before it turned negative in the 
afternoon as concerns over Europe's crisis returned ton risk appetite.
The ISEQ fell 12.80 points to 2,967.74.
World stocks rose, supported by a weaker dollar as investors took the view after weak U.S. economic data this 
week that the Federal Reserve will be slow to raise interest rates. Equities have gained this week as risk aversion 
eased, while commodities regained some stability after a sharp sell-off earlier in May, but mixed economic data has 
capped advances. The dollar struggled to make headway against a basket of currencies after data on Thursday 
showed a slowdown in manufacturing growth in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region and an unexpected fall in existing 
home sales in April.
The transformation of the landscape for the Irish banking sector continues apace. As one lending institution closes 
its doors (Irish Nationwide), it seems that another (NAMA) is branching out into lending in a bid to improve liquidity 
in the Irish property market. Results yesterday from Irish Nationwide were, as expected, catastrophic, revealing a 
record E3.3bn loss last year. This mainly came as a result of the losses on loans that transferred to NAMA over the 
period. With its deposits already gone, the remaining loans will be merged with the remaining Anglo Irish Bank book 
and worked out over time. Shares in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent was all unmoved at E0.20, 
E0.21 and E0.12 respectively. Kingspan's stocks climbed 3c to E7.03. Davey went on a tour of two of the

Major stock indexes staged their second straight gain Thursday as a doubling in LinkedIn's share price spurred 
hopes that initial public offerings can lure more investors into risk assets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a gain of 45.14 points, or 0.36%, at 12605.32, led by American 
Express (NYSE:AXP) , which added 76 cents, or 1.5%, to $51.82, and McDonald's, which gained 1.01, or 1.2%, to 
82.51.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 2.92, or 0.22%, to 1343.60, boosted by the industrial and 
telecommunications sectors.
The Nasdaq Composite rose 8.31, or 0.30%, to 2823.31 for its third straight gain. Trading was relatively light, with 
about 3.3 billion shares changing hands in NYSE composite volume.
Investors said the sharp rise in professional networking site LinkedIn's stock on its first day of trading ignited hopes 
that successful IPOs can help drive more capital off the sidelines. LinkedIn's stock closed up 109% at $94.25, 
making it 2011's best-performing initial public offering, according to data from Standard & Poor's. The gains came in 
spite of a batch of weak economic data.
Stocks lost some of their footing mid-morning after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's reading on mid-
Atlantic manufacturing activity plunged. Meanwhile, sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. fell slightly in

April. The data washed out some of the favorable sentiment that followed better than expected unemployment 
claims figures early Thursday.
European Stocks
European stock markets ended higher Thursday as Air France-KLM (NYSE:AKH WS)  (OOTC:AFLYY)  and 
Investec PLC posted solid financial results, while the banking sector gained as investor risk appetite grew. The 
Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.7% to close at 280, helped initially by a strong end to Wall Street's trading session 
Wednesday.
European markets trimmed gains, however, as U.S. stocks faltered in Thursday's session. Air France-KLM rose 
1.9% after the airline said improving economic conditions led to an uptick in traffic and helped offset rising fuel 
costs. The results lifted shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  (NASDAQ:RYAAY) , up 1.3% in Dublin, 
and International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 2.1% in London.

Meanwhile, bank stocks gained across Europe. Societe Generale rose 0.6% in Paris and Barclays PLC 
(NYSE:BCS)  rallied 2.5% in London. London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.5% to close at 5,955.99, with Investec PLC 
jumping 5.4% after the financial-services group reported a 22% jump in fiscal-year net profit. In energy, light-crude 
futures dipped below $100 a barrel after a string of disappointing U.S. data.
Oil producers held on to gains, however, with shares of BP PLC (NYSE:BP)  gaining 1.6% in London and Total SA 
(NYSE:TOT)  rising 1.2% in Paris. The rise for Total, along with gains for banking stocks, helped push the French 
CAC 40 index to a 1.3% gain, ending at 4,027.74. In Germany, the DAX 30 index advanced 0.7% to close at 
7,358.23. Siemens (NYSE:SI)  AG added 2.3% after being one of the hardest-hit stocks in the recent spate of profit-
taking on German markets.
Asian Stocks
Asian shares ended mixed Thursday, with Japanese stocks falling on data showing the nation's economy 
contracted sharply in the January-March period. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.4% to 9620.82, South Korea's 
Kospi skidded 1.9% to 2095.51, China's Shanghai Composite declined 0.5% to 2859.57, and Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng Index gained 0.7% to 23,163.38.
Stock losses in Tokyo came after data showed the March 11 earthquake and tsunami resulted in gross domestic 
product contracting 0.9% in the January-March period from the preceding three months, or a 3.7% annualized 
decline. The fall marked the second consecutive quarter of contraction, taking Japan into what economists call a 
technical recession.

Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE:MTU)  Inc. fell 2.1%,Advantest Corp. dropped 3.4% and JFE 
Holdings Inc. lost 1.6%. Japanese utilities declined after Prime Minister Naoto Kan Wednesday raised the possibility 
of splitting up electricity generation and distribution businesses. Tokyo Electric Power Co. (OOTC:TKECY) , which 
will release its fiscal year results Friday, tumbled 8%, Tohoku Electric Power Co. (OOTC:TEPCY)  dropped 3.2% 
and Chubu Electric Power Co. (OOTC:CHUEY)  gave up 5.1%. In Seoul, stocks dropped amid continued foreign 
selling, with Hyundai Motor Co. (OOTC:HYMOF)  falling 2.1%, KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB)  losing 2.2% 
and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (OOTC:HXSCF)  dropping 3.8%.
Base Metals
Global Markets Overview 20 May 2011
Base metals closed mostly lower on the London Metal Exchange Thursday, following a day of currency-driven 
range trading that saw the metals fail to maintain the upward momentum of the previous session. LME three-month 
copper closed the open outcry session at $8,949 a metric ton, 1.3% below Wednesday's PM kerb close. While a 
return to the record prices seen earlier in the year may still be in sight for the red metal, upward progress is likely to 
be choppy and labored, market players said. LME lead was the only metal of the complex to finish the session in 
positive territory, trading up 1.1% at $2,472/ton at the PM kerb close.
Oil futures fell Thursday after a series of economic reports raised concerns about weakening crude demand. Light, 
sweet crude for June delivery settled down $1.66, or 1.7%, at $98.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange fell $1.02, or 0.9%, to $111.28 a barrel. Market watchers have 
been closely eyeing reports on the health of the U.S. economy ahead of the summer driving season, when gasoline 
use peaks. Disappointing readings sent Nymex crude tumbling below $100, a day after settling above the 
psychologically significant threshold for the first time in a week.
A stronger U.S. employment picture weighed on gold prices, with silver losing steam to end in negative territory as 
traders remain jittery after the metal's steep losses earlier this month. The most actively traded gold contract, for 
June delivery, ended down $3.40, or 0.2%, at $1,492.40 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. The May-delivery contract was down $3.40 at $1,492.20 with one contract traded. The most 
active silver contract, for July delivery, slipped 16.5 cents, or 0.5%, to $34.932 a troy ounce. Thinly traded May-
delivery silver was down 16.7 cents, or 0.5%, at $34.927 a troy ounce.

Ryanair warned the public today that scam artists are targeting the public, fraudulently claiming that they have won 
a car in the airline's draw.
Ryanair have notified Consumer Direct (the UK agency who deal with internet scams) of the email scam which tries 
to dupe people into paying £500 for delivery of a 'Ryanair car promo' claiming the email recipient has won a car in a 
Ryanair scratchcard draw.
This email scam emerged after Ryanair recently confirmed that a printing error resulted in three lucky passengers 
on one flight, from Milan to Madrid, each winning a E13,000 car after buying a E2 Ryanair scratchcard onboard the 
Ryanair aircraft.
"Ryanair has contacted the authorities to ensure that people are not duped into paying money to these 
unscrupulous scam artists believing that they have won a car. Only passengers that have purchased a scratchcard, 
revealed three car symbols and contacted Brandforce directly can win a prize, which is free of any form of payment 
or delivery charges. It is disgraceful that these criminals try to turn three people's good luck into other people's 
misfortune," Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said.

News In Brief
## Sean Quinn and his family are preparing legal proceedings over their loss of control of the Quinn Group. It is 
understood the action will be against the Financial Regulator and Anglo Irish Bank. Last month the bank appointed 
a share receiver to the Quinn Group, while Quinn Insurance has been sold to the bank and US group Liberty 
Mutual. - RTE
## The number of new private cars registered in April rose by 16.4pc compared with the same period last the year, 
according to newly released official figures. 11,171 private cars were registered in April, according to the Central 
Statistics Office. The number of new goods vehicles licensed in April 2011 was 1,219 compared with 1,070 in the 
corresponding month last year, an increase of 13.9pc. - Irish Independent
## The owners of world-renowned stud farms Coolmore and Ballydoyle have launched a constitutional challenge to 
the legally-binding Joint Labour Committee system of setting wages in the agricultural sector. The move comes as 
Linley Investments, which owns Coolmore and Ballydoyle, faced prosecution by the Minister for Enterprise Jobs 
and Innovation Richard Bruton at Clonmel District Court today for alleged breaches of employment law. No one 
from Coolmore or Ballydoyle was available for comment. The alleged breaches included refusing to provide records 
to a National Employment Rights Authority inspector, and failure to pay wage rates and Sunday premiums in 
accordance with the Employment Regulation Order governing agricultural employees. The District Court 
proceedings were adjourned until November. - Irish Examiner ## The National Employment Rights Authority 
prosecuted 143 employers last year for breaching workers rights and secured convictions in 32 cases. NERA's 
Director Ger Deering told IBEC's employment law conference it had carried out inspections of over 5,000 
workplaces during that period. He said that 48,000 euros had been secured in fines from non-compliant employers. 
He pointed out that some of the prosecutions taken last year have not yet been completed, so further convictions 
may follow. - RTE ## Ryanair has today confirmed that passengers who paid the E3 tax on advance bookings can

apply for refund of the tax once the Government confirms the effective date for its abolition. The airline said that it 
continues to explore proposals for rapid traffic growth which it presented to the Department of Transport and has 
the potential to deliver up to five million incremental passengers p.a. at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports over the 
next five years. "Ryanair passengers who made bookings to travel to/from Irish airports will be able to apply for a 
refund of the 3 euro tourist tax once details of the effective date for the abolition of the tax are confirmed," said 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara. - Irish Examiner ## The National Treasury Management Agency is undertaking its 
first investor road-show since Ireland's EU/IMF bailout. NTMA chief executive John Corrigan, head of debt 
management and fundraising Oliver Whelan, chief economist Rossa White and others are beginning a series of 
meetings with existing and potential investors overseas. The first series of visits is to China, Hong Kong, Singapore 
and Malaysia. Other trips between now and the end of June include a European tour to London, Frankfurt and 
Paris, and East and West coast USA. The aim is stay in personal contact with investors or potential investors, even 
though Ireland is not going back to the markets until the second half of next year at the earliest. - RTE ## Two 
companies of developers Ray and Danny Grehan have initiated High Court proceedings challenging the 
appointment by the National Asset Management Agency of receivers to the Glenroyal Hotel and Leisure Centre in 
Co Kildare. The proceedings by Glenkerrin Properties Ltd and Glenroyal Leisure Ltd have been taken against 
NAMA and accountants Paul McCann and Michael McAteer, who were appointed receivers last month. The 
companies allege there is no lawful basis for the appointment of Mr McCann and Mr McAteer as receivers or 
receiver/managers of the Glenroyal Hotel and Leisure Centre and are seeking injunctions restraining them 
operating the businesses. - Irish Times ## The country's two main medical organisations have been invited by 
Minister for Health James Reilly to begin discussions on holding talks on new contracts for GPs and consultants. In 
a letter to the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association, Mr Reilly has asked the

Body
The ISEQ followed the rest of Europe's indices lower today as the arrest of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
added fresh uncertainty to the euro zone debt crisis.
The index fell 19.68 points to 2,985.36.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.9 percent at 1,130.27 points, below the 50-day 
moving average, a negative technical signal, though strategists were more upbeat for the longer term. Euro zone 
finance ministers are likely to back a bailout package for Portugal, with new conditions set by Finland, in talks 
overshadowed by charges against Strauss-Kahn for attempted rape. A Brussels meeting was also expected to 
pressure Greece to announce more austerity steps to secure further emergency funding. A senior Greek official 
said on Sunday the arrest of Strauss-Kahn may cause some delays to its EU/IMF bailout plan.
The Irish banking system's borrowings from the ECB stood at E106bn on April 29th compared to E114.5bn on 
March 25th. In addition, reliance on the Central Bank's ELA facility was down from E66.8bn at the end of March to 
E54bn at the end of April. In aggregate, Irish system reliance of E160bn in April compared with E181.3bn in March, 
a reduction of E21bn. The reduction largely reflected the placing of E18bn 'temporary' deposits with the banks by 
the NTMA (reflecting the E17.8bn of the E85bn support package that has been drawn). Meanwhile, AIB has 
confirmed the issuance and allotment of an additional 1.2bn shares to the state at an average 30-day trading price 
of 23.156c per share to meet its E280m annual dividend on the state's preference shares. Shares in AIB were flat at 
E0.20, Bank of Ireland was down 1c to E0.23 while Irish Life and Permanent dropped 1c to E0.13. Ryanair reports 
full-year results to end-March on May 23. Ryanair has guided to achieve profits (net income pre-exceptionals) at the 
upper end of E380-400m for 2011 (Davy: E400m). Updates on potential aircraft acquisition discussions/future 
special dividends, hedging positions and summer yield trends will be the focus of results as will 2012 guidance (we 
assume E425m net profit and yield growth of 7.5pc). Passenger numbers below the 78.5m forecast for 2012 may

be sought to improve the loss-making winter period. Shares in the airline climbed 4c to E3.60. Aer Lingus remained 
unmoved at E0.83. William Hill and Playtech jointly announced that they have reached an amicable resolution of 
their dispute relating to Playtech's interests in William Hill Online. As a consequence, the parties have applied for 
the injunction secured by William Hill against certain Playtech group companies to be discharged. Shares in Paddy 
Power fell 3c to E33.94. Independent News and Media (INM) released an IMS revealing that trading in the first 18 
weeks of the year was behind where we would have expected it to be at this stage of the year. Although the 
company has reported a return to more normalised trading in more recent weeks, Davy are taking a more cautious 
approach to numbers and are revising downwards their 2011 and 2012 EBIT forecasts by 5.3pc and 5.6pc 
respectively. "We now expect 2011 EBIT to come in at E85m, at the bottom of the guided range," it said. INM's

Ryanair has met with officials from the Chinese aircraft maker Comac recently about future potential plane orders, 
its finance director has confirmed.
The airline, which up to now has exclusively used Boeing aircraft, is also set for talks with Russian plane makers.
"We have met with the Chinese aviation company. We are also meeting with other aircraft manufacturers," Howard 
Millar told reporters.
"We have no plans for any future aircraft orders, but beyond the horizon, 2014 and 2015, we need to look at some 
fleet replacement and some growth, and we are meeting with all manufacturers to discuss what they have to offer." 
Mr Millar said Ryanair had also met two Russian manufacturers. "We have met both of them," he said. "These are 
new entrants into the market. "Given the size and the scale of the Chinese, you ignore them at your peril." Ryanair 
currently flies only Boeing jets. It is thought that the low-cost carrier has also held talks with Russian aircraft 
makers, United Aircraft and Irkut. While Irkut and Comac have provided jets to their domestic carriers, they are 
largely untested in the European and Western markets. With its usual disdain for traditional thinking or convention, 
Ryanair does not see buying planes from less well- known suppliers as an issue. "We would do anything seriously 
that would save us money," said the airline's Michael Cawley. Ryanair's fleet is totally made up of 737-800 jets, with 
a list price of about E59m each. The Chinese or Russian jets may be considerably cheaper when ready. Ryanair 
has form when it comes to extracting massive discounts from manufacturers. Michael O'Leary pulled off one of the 
biggest coups in aviation history when placing a bumper order for Boeing jets just days after the 9-11 attacks. 
Russian aircraft maker Irkut is developing a 150-seat- plus medium range jet called the Ms-21, which has already 
been ordered by Aeroflot and VEB. The Chinese are also working on the Comac C919, which is a similar type of jet.

The ISEQ followed the rest of Europe's indices lower this morning as the arrest of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-
Kahn added fresh uncertainty to the euro zone debt crisis.
By 12:30, the index had fallen 24.33 points to 2,980.71.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.9 percent at 1,130.27 points, below the 50-day 
moving average, a negative technical signal, though strategists were more upbeat for the longer term. Euro zone 
finance ministers are likely to back a bailout package for Portugal today, with new conditions set by Finland, in talks 
overshadowed by charges against Strauss-Kahn for attempted rape. A Brussels meeting was also expected to 
pressure Greece to announce more austerity steps to secure further emergency funding. A senior Greek official 
said on Sunday the arrest of Strauss-Kahn may cause some delays to its EU/IMF bailout plan.

Varadkar and DAA clash on charges
Varadkar and DAA clash on charges

Length: 382 words
Body
Serious tensions between the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and the new transport and tourism minister Leo 
Varadkar preceded the decision of DAA chairman David Dilger to resign.
The tensions related to plans by the new minister to hold down airport charges to try to boost passenger numbers.
This was in line with demands from Ryanair and Aer Lingus the two big airlines at airports under the DAA's control, 
which include Cork and Shannon.
Dilger, who announced his plan to step down last Friday, is believed to have been unhappy with the minister's 
strategy, along with a number of his board colleagues. Sources believe that they feel that policy is being overly 
influenced by what the airlines want.
Varadkar has said he wants lower charges at the country's airports to boost tourism numbers.
However the DAA needs to service a debt of almost  1 billion and has resisted airline calls for lower charges, 
instead announcing a new incentive scheme to try to encourage more passengers. Passenger charges have 
increased by 7 per cent this year.
The DAA and the Department of Transport have played down suggestions of tensions.
The DAA, in a statement last Friday, said Dilger had resigned so as to ''afford more time to his broad range of other 
interests''. However sources say that tensions have emerged between the board of the DAA and the new minister 
over the new government's strategy.
Varadkar has taken on responsibility for tourism as well as transport as part of his new brief and this is thought to 
be influencing his approach.
Historically the Department of Transport would have been supportive of the DAA.
Varadkar and DAA clash on charges
However tourism is also now included in the Department's brief and attracting more visitors from overseas is a key 
part of the new government's jobs strategy announced last week. It involved a cut in Vat as it applies to much of the 
tourism sector, which is seen as a key potential creator of new jobs. The former Greencore chief executive made 
the unexpected announcement after a board meeting at Dublin Airport.
He had served two years of his term. Dilger is a director of James Hardie International, a global construction 
supplies company, and an angel investor. He is also overseeing the construction of a new home in the south of 
France.
Dilger was not available for comment this weekend.

Some insurance companies are charging more than double other firms' prices for travel insurance, according to a 
comparison by The Sunday Business Post.
Consumers who are travelling abroad this summer can expect a huge variation in the cost of insuring their holiday, 
depending on which insurer they choose.
The Sunday Business Post asked 13 insurers to give their cheapest quote for basic travel cover for one adult 
travelling to Spain for one week this summer.
Bank of Ireland provided the lowest quote at  6.68,withAAreturning the highest quote at  14.95.
Two insurers, Allianz and Vhi, do not provide cover for single trips and only insure travellers under annual, multitrip 
travel insurance policies.
However, the premium charged for a travel insurance policy is not the only factor to consider when taking out cover.
Consumers should also look at the cover limits in their chosen insurer's policies. Insurers were also asked to give 
details of the maximum benefits their policies would provide for claims in relation to medical expenses, holiday 
cancellation, travel delays and baggage loss.
The comparison revealed a significant variation in the level of cover provided.
For example, the amount that insurers would pay out in the event of a holiday cancellation started at just  3,000, 
with AIB, Aviva and Ryanair providing This much cover.
Other insurers provided more than three times' this level of cover, with Vhi and Axa paying out up to  10,000.

Profits rose at telecoms group BT Ireland for its latest year despite a fall in revenue.
The business, which operates across the whole island, saw revenue drop by 3pc to just under £750m in the year to 
the end of March.
The fall came as tough economic conditions continued to impact the business.
But it posted an 11pc rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) as cost-cutting 
filtered through to the bottom line and it delivered a number of large retail and wholesale contracts. "BT has had a 
strong year in the Irish market, improving profitability and cash flow, while managing the pressure on our revenues," 
said Graham Sutherland, chief executive of BT Ireland. "We continue to transform our cost base, a process we

The Irish Hotels Federation has given a warm welcome to the package of measures to help the tourism industry 
that have been announced by the government.
It said moves represented "one of most comprehensive policy initiatives supporting the tourism industry in the last 
decade".
The measures, announced by finance minister Michael Noonan as part of the government's "jobs initiative", 
included a reduced temporary VAT rate of 9 pc for businesses involved in tourism.
He also announced the abolition of the 3 euro travel tax, possibly by July 1, though this is subject to agreement with 
the airlines on bringing in additional passengers. Ryanair described the decision to end the travel tax as " a 
welcome move by the new government towards change and reform of Irish tourism". The airline said it was working 
with transport minister Leo Varadkar to see if a competitive cost package could be finalised at Irish airports. The 
Restaurant Association of Ireland also welcomed the initiative, in particular the reduction in the VAT rate. "It is a 
sensible approach to have a meaningful VAT reduction of a targeted nature, rather than a very small cut spread 
more thinly," said Brian Fallon, president of the association. Also yesterday the Dublin Airport Authority, which 
operates Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports, said it will bring in a scheme to rebate passenger service charges to 
airlines at each of its airports once the threshold of the previous year's traffic total has been surpassed at the airport 
in question. Details of a new tourism marketing fund were also announced for Tourism Ireland yesterday. It will 
spend the extra money in collaboration with airlines and the three state airports.

Shares in the Elan drugs company gained 7c to 554 this morning after it announced the USD 960m sale of its drugs 
technologies arm.
The long expected sale is to US biotech company Alkermes.
The ISEQ index climed briefly above 3,000 again this morning before sinking back below the landmark level in line 
with weak market conditions elsewhere in Europe.
Market sentiment is being depressed by continued worry aboput euro zone debt, with the likelihood of a further 
Greek bailout emerging at the weekend. A short time ago the ISEQ had retreated 2,994.90, up just 2.31 points. 
Other positive performers this morning were Aryzta, up 27c to 3856, CRH ahead by 19c to 1670, and DCC up 7c to 
2232. On a downer were Ryanair, by 5c to 355, and Smurfit Kappa, by 10c to 822.

Last week's collapses in commodity prices and the value of the euro could provide unexpected benefits to Irish 
companies and equity investors as lower fuel costs and cheaper export prices filter down.
Last Thursday saw a massive worldwide drop in the entire basket of commodities, led by a 10 per cent fall in oil 
prices, as worries about economic growth in major markets and the rise of the dollar against the euro prompted 
speculators to dump their positions.
However, Irish transport companies and exporters should welcome the dip, analysts said.
''Commodity price falls are good news economic-wise," said Rory Gillen, financial advisor and founder of InvestR 
Centre, in a bulletin to clients.
''With the backdrop remaining very favourable for risk assets, it is likely that the commodity sell-off is an 
opportunity."
Oil lost 13 per cent on the week to settle below $110 a barrel, raising hopes that transport costs could slide.
''As a small, open economy, Ireland relies heavily on transport," said Eamonn Hughes, head of equity research at 
Goodbody Stockbrokers. ''It's potentially helpful for Aer Lingus, Ryanair and ICG. A big chunk of their input costs 
will be lower. Prices had caused particular pressure on margins. The volatility is difficult to manage."
Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, surprised investors when he indicated 
interest rates would not rise until July, rather than June as expected.
This prompted an exit from the euro which continued through Friday. The euro fell from$1.50 to below $1.44 in just 
two days of trading.
''It's no harm to exporters," said Hughes.
Sell-off could be boost for Ireland
Irish exporters to the US, one of Ireland's top three markets, can now sell their products at better prices.
Silver and gold, normally considered safe havens in turbulent markets, also lost ground. Silver gave up 27 per cent 
on the week, continuing a dive begun in April after investors began to feel a speculative bubble was forming. Gold 
also surrendered some recent gains, but in small percentages.
''Absolutely nothing has changed regarding the fundamentals driving the gold and silver markets and there is likely 
to be another correction in gold and another sharp correction in silver," said Mark O'Byrne of Goldcore.
''With macroeconomic, monetary and geopolitical risks remaining, safe haven demand from investors, pension 
funds and central banks is likely to continue.

Irish software company, Salmon Software has announced a E500,000 investment in its new cloud computing 
treasury management product.
It has also established a new sister company, TGold Software to develop and market it globally.
The Dublin headquartered firm is targeting a market estimated to be worth in excess of E100m in Ireland and the 
UK.
Founded in 1985, Salmon specialises in foreign exchange and treasury management software for blue chip 
international companies including Securitas, Fexco and Ryanair and TGold is its first cloud computing offering. 
Salmon was one of a number of indigenous Irish companies identified by Enterprise Ireland in a programme 
designed to take Irish software to the cloud. "The global cloud computing market is expected to be worth an 
estimated E40-110 billion by 2014 and is the fastest growing sector of the global software market," said John Magill, 
Senior Development Advisor, Enterprise Ireland. "We believe that Salmon has vital first mover advantage in its 
sector and has the potential to build a significant Irish global cloud computing company." TGold is a treasury 
management system that has been developed on the industry leading salesforce.com cloud platform. It allows 
businesses to automate, manage and increase the accuracy of its foreign exchange transactions by making 
payments in local and foreign currencies, book money market and FX trades, access management reports on 
currency positions and balances as well as providing an accurate audit trail of trades and payment instructions. "In 
the past such a system would have cost businesses a six figure investment in hardware, software and 
implementation. This is now available on a cloud based subscription model with no other costs which means 
companies of all sizes can now better manage their forex transactions," commented John Byrne CEO, Salmon

Aer Lingus will look at trying to get reductions in airport charges and fuel costs before it considers another round of 
job and pay cuts, the airline said today.
Faced with "awful" economic conditions in its home market, higher fuel costs and constant pressure from its larger 
and leaner rival Ryanair, Aer Lingus is considering ramping up existing cost-cutting measures to cement its hard-
won return to profit.
Chief Executive Christoph Mueller told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual meeting that the group 
was not about to replicate its existing cost-cutting programme, known as "Greenfield", which has saved it 72 million 
euros but triggered an expensive bout of industrial action earlier in the year.
"We will first and foremost address those costs which have increased," Mueller said. "To just look on staff cost 
savings is a little too early. There are many more costs to be addressed. We have pledged that the staff would not 
be approached before 2012. We feel committed to that pledge, so we have to find other ways to address our 
increasing cost base." Mueller said the company would look at trying to reduce its fuel bill and would lobby the 
Dublin Airport Authority to reverse its 39 percent increase in airport charges. It will update investors on its progress 
in early June. Earlier, the company's chairman told investors that Aer Lingus, which returned to operating profit last 
year, had some way to go before it could consider paying them a dividend. "We had a relatively good year last year 
but we have a long, long way to go," Colm Barrington said. "Economic conditions in Ireland are awful, fuel prices 
have been rising very significantly, and the euro has been rising. "We are not out of the woods yet, and we think it 
would be premature to pay a dividend, and it would be damaging to Aer Lingus and its shareholders if we paid a 
dividend at the present time." The company's stock has risen around 20 percent since hitting a nine-month low of 
70 cents at the end of March, helped by a government-sponsored report published in April which recommended that 
the state sell its 25 percent stake in the airline. A government minister has said Dublin is unlikely to sell any state

assets this year, and Mueller said rumours that the government had been approached about its holding were 
speculation. "There is a lot of speculation. There are denials from the different (government) departments. I take 
that for granted. The rest appears to be speculation," Christoph Mueller told reporters on the sidelines of the 
airline's annual meeting. Ryanair, which has a near 30 percent stake in the company and has had two hostile bids 
for Aer Lingus rebuffed, said it had not made a fresh offer. "We haven't made a new bid," Finance Director Howard 
Millar, who attended the Aer Lingus AGM and berated its management for failing to pay a dividend, told reporters.

Shares in Aryzta jumped 80c to E38.30 and Kerry Group climbed 90c to E28.90 today as investors resumed their 
buying of Irish food firms on the back of solid quarterly sales and revenues for the sector and brokers' predictions of 
target beating numbers for the full year.
Latin American-based Arcos, to which Aryzta's FSB subsidiary is a top-four supplier, has reported comparable year-
on-year sales growth in Brazil of 9.2pc. In its first quarterly result since its listing last month, Arcos Dorados, Latin 
America's largest restaurant chain and the world's largest Mc Donald's franchisee, recorded system-wide 
comparable sales growth of 12.5pc. Airlines also gained with Ryanair up 13c to E3.59 and Aer Lingus up 2c to 
E0.84 as oil prices fell further, extending a 10pc crash the previous day as fears about global economic recovery 
pushed investors to unwind commodities positions. Aer Lingus will look at trying to get reductions in airport charges

continues to expect earnings growth and meaningful debt pay-down in 2011. "We do not believe that the Q1 results

EasyJet April Passenger Number, Load Factor Rise - Update

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) Friday reported passenger growth and higher load factor for April 
2011.
For the month, passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, rose 35.1 percent to 4.72 million from 
3.49 million in the year-ago month.
The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether or not the passenger turns up as 
easyJet is a no-refund airline. Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for 
business travel.
Load factor was 86.5 percent for the month, an increase of 1.3 percentage points from 85.2 percent last year. Load 
factor represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers.
In March, the company had reported an 11.9 percent rise in passengers while load factor declined 0.6 percentage 
points to 86.9 percent.
On a rolling 12 months basis, passengers totaled 52.46 million, an increase 11.8 percent from 46.94 million in the 
same period of last year.
Load factor rose 0.7 percentage points during the period to 87.2 percent from 86.5 percent a year ago.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Wednesday said that April load factor increased to 85 percent 
from 83 percent in the prior-year period. Passengers were 6.8 million, up 10 percent from 6.2 million last year.
EZJ.L is trading at 354.70 pence, up 11.80 pence or 3.44 percent, on a volume of 952,041 shares.

Budget airlines have looked down on their network carrier competitors for years. We actually make money most of 
the time, they crow (it does not take much to feel superior in a sector that routinely fails to cover its cost of capital). 
This year, though, higher oil prices should in theory erode their competitive advantage, since fuel accounts for a 
higher proportion of their costs. They also lack price-insensitive business travellers who can help pay for more 
expensive fuel.
Worried investors should not underestimate the budget airlines, though. Over the past five years, the oil price has 
risen 60 per cent, yet budget carriers have held total unit costs steady or even cut them, by pruning crew costs and 
getting cheap deals on planes. They also use their planes more efficiently. Europe's network carriers, which time 
their short-haul flights to feed long-haul routes, keep their planes in the air for six to seven hours a day, according to 
Deutsche Bank. Ryanair and EasyJet keep their planes flying for nine to 10 hours a day.
Even if budget airlines struggle to shave off more costs, they should be able to raise revenue by taking market 
share from the network carriers. EasyJet and Ryanair are moving to more mainstream airports; EasyJet is actively 
targeting business travellers. This strategy depends on decent execution, something EasyJet still needs to prove 
after a summer of operational mistakes . Ryanair's management, though, is second to none. And whether by luck or 
judgment, it has hedged 90 per cent of its fuel needs this year, compared with the European airline average of 60 
per cent.
As the airlines report their first-quarter results this month, Ryanair's valuation (its lowest since the recession at 10 
times next year's expected earnings) looks too low. A good business model with good management can ride out all 
kinds of storms.

Irish shares have edged marginally higher this morning, ending three days of falls.
The modest gain runs counter to a generally lower trend on European markets after poor US jobs news yesterday,

A short time ago the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 3.63 points to 2,930.16.

IRISH airline Aer Lingus may ramp up a controversial cost-cutting plan after confirming profit this year will be 
significantly below 2010 due to weak demand and higher fuel prices.
Facing constant pressure from Ryanair, Aer Lingus has cut routes, staff and pay to survive and another round of 
cuts could put it on a fresh collision course with employees.
First-quarter revenues fell by five per cent but average yield per passenger rose by nine per cent due to a cut in 
poor performing rs outes and an increased proportion of business travellers.
Chief executive Christoph Mueller said "the level of profitability will be much lower" this year.

Seventy investors from Ireland, the US, Britain and Italy are to receive pitches from six new Irish technology 
companies at a special demonstration day on Friday.
The start-up companies are all part of Dublin City University's Ryan Academy for Entrepreneur ship incubation 
programme, the Propeller Venture Accelerator Fund, and this is their opportunity to pitch for funding from the 
investors.
The Propeller Venture Accelerator was established last year by Declan Ryan, son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, 
with  1 million of funding from his private investment company Irelandia Investments.
The aim is to accelerate early-stage technology startup companies, both Irish and international, in Dublin.
The startups include five from Ireland and one from Britain. They cover key technologies such as mobile 
applications, clean tech, online gaming, health informatics and internet applications.
More than 40 corporate mentors from a range of high tech companies - as well as serial entrepreneurs - have been 
working with the Propeller companies over the last three months.
''There is no doubt that the heavily mentor-led foundation of Propeller has allowed these companies to speed up 
their development," said Gordon McConnell, deputy chief executive officer of the Ryan Academy, and Propeller 
director.
''One of the founders has referred to it as 'getting off the bus and onto a bullet train', which I think is a good 
analogy," he said.
The six technology companies that are presenting to the investors are:
D-day for new Irish tech companies
* Associate Mobile: This start-up is developing cloud based mobile platforms for enterprise and consumer markets. 
Mobile Minder - a parental supervision platform for mobiles is the company's first commercial output.
* Fantom: This company is taking the school yard trading cards game online with a new social media site.
& GreenEgg Technologies: This is a research and development company focused on technological solutions for the 
clean technology and environmental sectors. The company develops innovative eco friendly products.
* HealthComms: This startup aims to become a leading specialist in providing health and security solutions to the 
Equine Industry. It has developed Equinewatch, which provides continuous monitoring of location and telemetry of 
animals.
Its highly visual-based systems provide means for alerting owners when unusual events such as isolation, agitation 
or temperature variation occur.
* Simple Life Forms: This is an online games development, publishing and consultancy firm. It develops games for 
the world's most dynamic game platforms such as Facebook, iPhone and iPad.
* Vendorshop: This start-up enables businesses to sell products on Facebook via their social shopping cart 
application.
Vendor Shop is free to install and currently powers 15,000 stores worldwide.
The Propeller Accelerator provides seed funding, collaboration space and a three month mentor-led programme for 
the companies.
It was announced as a charter member of the Techstars Network earlier in the year and also has agreed 
partnerships with the Halo Business Angel Network (HBAN) and the Irish Technology Leadership Group (ITLG).
A number of Irish-based companies have also signed up to support the programme including Sage Ireland, Arthur 
Cox, Publicis D, Tomkins IP and Deloitte. Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (Isme) organisation and Enterprise 
Ireland are also partners in the fund, which is also linked to the Venture Catalyst at Arizona State University.
It is part of the DCU Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship which is a partnership between DCU and the family of the 
late Tony Ryan.
The academy promotes entrepreneurship and innovation and its offices at Citywest in Dublin include a hub for 
entrepreneurs and researchers to develop ideas, learn new skills and network.

Ryanair attacks regulations, despite recording profits
Ryanair attacks regulations, despite recording profits

Length: 474 words
Highlight: Low cost carrier, Ryanair, announces FY/2011 profits but strikes back at regulators about difficult 
operating conditions.
Body
Ryanair has reported (EURO)401 million ($567 million) profits for financial year 2011, a year-on-year rise of 26%. 
Traffic grew by 8% to 72 million passengers leading to revenues of (EURO)3.7 billion, up by 21% from March 2010. 
The airline says there was a 27% hike in airport fees, which led to Dublin airport traffic falling by 30% to just 18 
million passengers.  At the peak in 2007 the airport recorded 24.5 million passengers. 
"To reverse this disastrous collapse, and return to tourism growth, the DAA airport monopoly should be broken up 
and replaced with competing terminals and airports, which will deliver competitive airport charges," says Michael 
O'Leary, CEO, Ryanair.
"We welcome the Government's recent decision to scrap the tourist tax as a step in the right direction, but unless 
accompanied by competitive airport charges, traffic growth will not return at the Government owned, high cost, Irish 
airports."  
The company, which had 14,000 flight cancellations due to volcanic ash disruptions, airport closures due to snow 
and strikes, also says that the EU 261 regulations - that forces airlines to pay compensation during these kinds of 
events - is unfair. 
"It is discriminatory that train, ferry, and coach operators (as well as insurance companies) escape this liability 
during force majeure events, yet EU 261 compels airlines to suffer these costs," says O'Leary, who calls for reform 
to provide a fair and level playing field for all EU transport operators.
Ryanair is typically outspoken about a regulations and creating a fair and level playing field. At the European 
Airifinance conference in Dublin in January Ryanair, which uses export credit to finance its aircraft deliveries, 
criticized the new Aircraft Sector Understanding. Howard Millar, CFO, Ryanair said the airline would legally 
challenged the agreement in the European court. To read more, click here. 
Ryanair attacks regulations, despite recording profits
During the past year, fuel costs for the airline were up by 37% to (EURO)1.2 billion. For FY12 the airline is 90% 
hedged at $820 per tonne (about $82 per barrel), which is a 12% price increase on last year, but lower than current 
prices. 
"Higher oil prices next winter, and the refusal of some airports to offer lower charges, makes it more profitable to 
tactically ground up to 80 aircraft (40 last winter) rather than suffer losses operating them to high cost airports at low 
winter yields," says O'Leary.
Due to higher oil prices - the company estimates a fuel bill increase of â,¬350 million for FY12 -  the carrier says 
that the operating cost per passenger will rise by 13% this year. Even so, the airline anticipates a (EURO)400 
million profit after tax for FY12.
Ryanair, which is based in Ireland and operates a total fleet of 272 aircraft, took delivery of 40 new jets during the 
financial year and has remaining orders with Boeing for 40 737-800s.

Aircraft maker eyes radical revamp
Fierce competition fuels innovation
Body
Boeing is considering a -revamp of its -venerable 737 aircraft, the most widely flown commercial jet, in-cluding a 
plan for a new aircraft with a main body made of the plastic composites used in its groundbreaking 787 Dreamliner .
Another option the US aircraft maker has been quietly outlining in presentations to its leading airline customers 
would see it replace the singleaisle 737 it first started -making in the 1960s with a twin-aisle aircraft.
The company is referring to this option, which would transform the way millions of people fly, as the "new light twin", 
said executives briefed on Boeing's plans.
Jeff Smisek, chief executive of the newly merged United Continental group in the US, said the idea was for a "highly 
fuel efficient" new jet seating at least 200.
The move comes as Boeing and Airbus, its European competitor, face rising pressure from rival manufacturers to 
find cheaper, more fuel-efficient replacements for their best-selling jets - the 737 and Airbus's younger A320 family 
of aircraft - which together make up nearly half of all commercial jets in operation.
Airbus took the plunge in December, announcing it would put new engines on its A320 to shave fuel consumption 
by 15 per cent.
It has since won more than 300 commitments for these planes, as fuel prices have soared amid Middle East unrest.
Boeing is still weighing its options, including a fuselage made of the plastic composites used in its much-delayed 
787 Dreamliner, but wings made of traditional aluminium.
Boeing considers plastic 737 body
The company has also been looking at following Airbus and re-engining the 737, though Jim Albaugh, head of 
Boeing's commercial aircraft division , has said he thinks most airlines would prefer to wait longer for an all-new jet.
Beverly Wyse, general manager of the 737 programme at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, told the Financial 
Times the company was still some way from a final decision on what she called "the new small aeroplane".
"If you did a twin-aisle, you can get turn-time -benefits because you can load and offload passengers much more 
quickly," she said.
But widening the diameter of the jet's main body meant "you are going to give up something in terms of fuel 
efficiency, so it's really about figuring out where those trades are".
She added: "You could even imagine we could do a re-engine and then later do a new small airplane."
Howard Millar, finance director at Ryanair, one of the 737's largest customers, had reservations about the twin-aisle 
idea, which could also boost seating capacity from current levels of less than 200 passengers.
"Turnround times would be helped by a twin aisle," he said. "However, building a twin aisle with a capability of up to 
250 seats means the aircraft will have to be pretty heavy, which affects fuel costs and airport charges driven by 
weight."

Ryanair has launched an investigation into a "printing error" that saw three passengers on a flight to Madrid last 
week each win a free Fiat 500 car worth EUR13,000 (£11,500).
The budget airline said it normally released one free car each month in the EUR2 scratch card game operated by 
Brandforce.
Daniel de Carvalho, Ryanair spokesman, said the airline would honour all the winning cards and any more that 
emerged up to the end of June. "We will sort out our losses with Brandforce at the end of this print run," he said.

Transport minister Leo Varadkar has warned Ryanair to stop wanting it "all its own way" in negotiations over the 
abolition of the travel tax.
He said this morning that the airline is taking it for granted in the negotiations that the tax will be abolished.
"But it's not for granted," he said.
The government has offered to abolish the 3 euro travel tax if more air routes are launched into the country to grow 
tourism. In an interview this morning with the Irish Independent, Mr Varadkar said he has made clear he definitely 
will not abolish the tax if there is not agreement to open more routes. Mr Varadkar said he had got on well with 
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary so far. "I've met Michael O'Leary one-to-one and will meet him again and 
the department has been meeting him, which is interesting, because seemingly it was the first time the department 
ever asked to meet him," he said. "I'd be happy to work with him. I'd be happy to take him on. We had a very good 
meeting. He brought the coffee and cakes. Very amicable." However, he said Ryanair was looking for a deal on 
airport charges as well, "which we are willing to look at". Mr Varadkar said he was also in talks with Aer Lingus, and 
was making good progress with the airline, which wanted to work on marketing new routes. The minister also said 
that if the tax was not abolished he would seek agreement from the Department of Finance to put the proceeds 
from it into tourism promotion. "I'm not interested in abolishing the travel tax or reducing airport charges so that 
Paddy and Mary can go to Palma or Mallorca or Lanzarote," he said. "If we don't abolish it, bear in mind that's 30m 
euros. Now that certainly doesn't belong to me. That's exchequer money but we can retain the 30m euros and use it 
for tourist marketing for specific routes," he said. Mr Varadkar added that he had an "open mind" on the options for 
the country's three state owned airports. He said it would be desirable to proceed with the long-standing plan to 
separate Cork and Shannon from Dublin to allow the three airports to compete for business. But he said Cork and 
Shannon were losing a lot of money and Dublin was carrying an enormous debt from Terminal 2. Mr Varadkar said 
Varadkar warns Ryanair over travel tax Varadkar Warns
an option is to part-privatise Cork and Shannon to avoid lumping their debts on to Dublin and give them 
independence.

A printing error on the Ryanair E2 scratchcard game has meant that three passengers on one flight from Milan to 
Madrid on 20th April last each won a free car worth over E13,000.
Ryanair generally gives away one free car in its E2 scratchcard game each month but admitted that it doesn't know 
whether there are any more of these printing error E2 scratchcards still on sale on its flights.
"Ryanair and Brandforce (the company which runs our E2 scratchcard game) have launched an enquiry into how 
this printing error caused 3 E13,000 cars to be won on one flight from Milan to Madrid last week," said Ryanair's 
Daniel de Carvalho.
"We remain concerned that this print run - which covers E2 scratchcards up to the end of June - may contain further 
print errors leading to an unexpected ratio of car winners for Ryanair passengers playing our E2 scratchcard game. 
"Both Ryanair and Brandforce have confirmed that they will honour all car winners regardless of how many crop up 
between now and the end of June and we will sort out our losses with Brandforce at the end of this print run."

Briefing
BOTSWANA ORDERS MORE PILATUS TRAINERS
ORDER Pilatus will supply the Botswana Defence Force with five PC-7 Mk II turboprop trainers by early 2013 under 
a roughly SFr40 million ($44.8 million) deal. To be delivered with a new ground-based training system and spare 
parts, the aircraft will replace the African nation's current six PC-7s, the last of which entered use in 1990.
BRIMSTONE USE FIRES EXPORT INTEREST
WEAPONS Two allied nations are interested in acquiring MBDA's dual-mode Brimstone following Royal Air Force 
use of the air-to-surface missile in Libya, a military source has revealed. MBDA declines to comment about 
assistant chief of the air staff Air Vice Marshal Baz North's claim that the lightweight weapon "is now being sought 
by both the USA and the French".
ETHIOPIA PICKS BLUEBIRD UAVS
UNMANNED SYSTEMS Ethiopia's army has contracted BlueBird of Israel to supply unmanned air vehicles and to 
establish local maintenance facilities for the equipment. Sources say the deal includes a version of the fuel cell-
powered Boomerang and the mini SpyLite.
THAI REVEALS A380 SEATING LAYOUT
CONFIGURATION Thai Airways International is to configure its Airbus A380s with 507 seats in three classes. The 
airline says it will fit 12 first-class, 60 business-class and 435 economy-class seats to the double-deck aircraft. Thai 
has ordered six A380s and has said it expects to take delivery of them by 2014.
QANTAS CHIEF WARNS ON FUEL PRICE THREAT
No Headline In Original
ECONOMICS Spiralling fuel costs are the biggest threat to Qantas since the global financial crisis, says chief 
executive Alan Joyce. Speaking to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, he said surcharges were 
"unfortunate, but essential" as fuel prices had risen 40% since November. Trade union leaders have accused the 
airline of "crying wolf" over the cost of fuel, says Joyce: "The truth is the wolf is not just inside the door, it's gnawing 
at our leg."
RYANAIR TO OFFER RESERVABLE SEATING
LOW-COST Budget carrier Ryanair is to test limited reserved seating following passenger feedback, particularly 
from the business community. From 16 May the airline says it will offer the front two rows, plus two overwing exit 
rows, to book on its Dublin-Malaga and Dublin-London Gatwick routes. This will provide 24 reservable seats on 
each Boeing 737-800 at a fee of E10 ($14) per sector.
EUROPE BLACKLISTS ALL MOZAMBICAN AIRLINES
SAFETY All airlines from Mozambique, including flag carrier LAM, have been blacklisted by the European 
Commission. The African state brings to 21 the number of countries subject to a blanket ban from the European 
Union over safety concerns. Two Boeing 767s operating for Air Madagascar are also banned. But the Commission 
has reprieved Ukraine's UM Air and four Indonesian cargo carriers.
ANZ SETS UP INSTITUTE FOR TRAINING
TRAINING Air New Zealand has established a specialist Aviation Institute to provide a range of training covering 
most airline industry roles, under a single organisation. Designed as a "one-stop shop" It will handle the majority of 
ANZ's needs as well as outsourced airline pilot, cabin crew, engineering and maintenance training.

As the summer months approach, the music industry is s et to come alive with a series of outdoor events that will 
attract tens of thousands of festival goers from around the country.
But for John Greened and Martin Gavin, the festival season will be more about business than pleasure. As the duo 
behind TicketGroup, Ireland's newest ticket agent, they hope the burgeoning festival culture will bring a surge in 
seasonal revenues.
Greaney, a one-time event organiser, established TicketGroup in 2009 with IT programmer Gavin to sell an all in 
one ticketing service to music promoters, event organisers and venue owners in Ireland.
Eighteen months on, the Dublin based company has established itself on the boutique festival circuit, having 
worked with the organisers behind the Kilruddery Festival in Wicklow, Donegal's surf and music event Sea 
Sessions, and Life Festival in Westmeath.
With the mainstream sports industry now firmly in their sights, Greaney and Gavin believe the company is well 
positioned to take on the might of Ticketmaster, by far the biggest player in the Irish market.
As the ticketing agent for promoters MCD, Aiken Promotions and Pod Concerts, Ticketmaster sells for high-profile 
annual festivals such as Oxegen, Electric Picnic and Cork's Live at The Marquee, but Greaney and Gavin are 
undeterred.
''The original idea for the business was basically down to the need for another contender in the market," said 
Greaney.
''We looked at it like this: Aer Lingus was the big player in the airline business for years, nobody was willing to take 
them on, and then suddenly Ryanair came along. I'm not saying we are Ryanair particularly, but there is always 
room for a strong number two in any market."
Business interview: John Greaney and Martin Gavin
Where TicketGroup differs from its rival, according to Greaney, is in its ability to provide a range of low-cost 
services that go beyond basic ticketing.
''We provide the complete package - ticket sales, marketing and distribution - in multiple event categories, including 
music, theatre, arts, comedy, festivals, clubs and concerts," he said. ''It is essentially down to the promoter to 
advertise the event and get the sales up, but we will do everything we can to publicise it ourselves, through flyers, 
magazine, posters, and radio and TV advertising."
In its first year, TicketGroup had revenues of  3.6 million. It takes bookings online on its website, 
www.ticketgroup.ie, and via a hotline number.
The company also recently agreed a deal with DVD retailer Xtravision to sell tickets through its nationwide chain of 
186 outlets.
Greaney sees the agreement as an important element in TicketGroup's sales strategy at a time when consumer 
trends are being shaped by the recession.
Although TicketGroup sees itself primarily as an online venture, deriving 70 per cent of revenues from web 
transactions, Greaney said its walk-in business was growing.
''Two years ago everybody used credit cards a lot.
Then, ticket sales in outlets would have accounted for maybe 8-10 per cent of sales, but now that's up to between 
20-22 per cent, which is basically down to an increase in the cash customer," he said. ''About 20 per cent of our 
sales are already coming from Xtra-vision. People just don't have the credit cards and they are spending money 
day by day, as opposed to buying six months ahead."
Greaney and Gavin spent ten months developing unique software before launching TicketGroup, which allows 
event organisers to pick and choose from a range of options.
''Ticketing can be a very costly business, but our costs are low and the process of setting up our system is pretty 
simple," said Gavin. ''For ticket sales we have a custom-built system which can be accessed on the internet 24/7 
and also feeds into all our outlets.
''We have box-office software as well, so if you are running an event, we can basically come on-site and manage 
the whole ticketing side of things for you.
We provide real-time reporting, so you can log into the system whenever you want and check sales or daily reports, 
or you can run your own online ticketing operations at a potentially very low cost."
A milestone in the company's early development was a contract to sell tickets for Masters of Dirt, a four-day 
motocross bike show, which took place in Citywest Convention Centre in April 2010.
''Masters of Dirt was a big event for us. We got a lot of publicity out of it, because Ticketmaster wasn't selling the 
tickets and people were curious," said Gavin.
''At the start, it was tough to break into the industry because some elements are so close knit.
Once you get one event, then another, it slowly builds and builds."
Following the Masters of Dirt deal, TicketGroup won subsequent Citywest contracts to sell tickets for a Dionne 
Warwick concert in September and, more recently, the WBA World Title Fight between Willie Casey and Brazil's 
Guillermo Rigo Rigondeaux.
Business interview: John Greaney and Martin Gavin
For the Kilruddery Festival, which took place last August in the grounds of Killruddery House and Gardens in Bray, 
Co Wicklow, the company managed ticket sales for performances by Jose Carreras and Michael Ball. It has also 
worked with the organisers of Waterfront, a food and music festival in the West Cork town of Clonakilty.
Greaney said the recent rise in small, locally-run festivals had held the company in good stead in its early days.
''Apart from MCD, Aiken and Pod, who are all contracted to Ticketmaster, we work with pretty much all of the rest of 
the music promoters in the country," he said.
''Everyone else has opened the door to us.
They have been willing to sit down and talk. Even if it has only been to allocate 50 per cent of the tickets for an 
event to us, there has always been something.
''If you look at some of the smaller festivals now, very few of them are run by MCD. Sea Sessions is run by a local 
committee in Bundoran, for example. Life Festival is also run by a sub-committee, so there are plenty of 
opportunities there."
TicketGroup will shortly launch ticket sales for Cork Comedy, a three-day outdoor event to take place in Fitzgerald 
Park in July.
Cork's first outdoor comedy festival, the event is expected to attract 25,000 visitors, with confirmed acts including 
Aprés Match's Barry Murphy and Gary Cooke, David O'Doherty and David McSavage.
''Cork is actually the home of comedy in Ireland, but over the last number of years, it has just been let slip with very 
few shows," said Greaney. ''We are going to revive this and we have the full support of Cork City Council, who have 
agreed to assist with everything from site to traffic management and parking."
TicketGroup is also working with live music venues, including the Róisín Dubh in Galway and Cork's Cyprus 
Avenue, but Greaney is particularly keen to build relationships with sporting organisations such as the GAA,FAI and 
the IRFU.
''We are meeting with the big sporting organisations and if we can get one of them, it will make a big difference to 
us," he said.
''We met with the GAA when we were just six months in, but they felt we weren't strong enough at the time.
We have reached a point now where we are quite confident about what we have to offer. We have tested the 
system and we have no glitches."
While TicketGroup is busy selling tickets for home-grown events, including this year's Kilruddery, Life and 
Castlepalooza festivals, Greaney and Gavin also hope to move into Overseas markets.
''Ultimately, we hope to go international, so the next two to three months will be all about the development side 
again," said Greaney. ''Music, sport, comedy, theatre, charity events - we can pretty much sell anything.
''Again, Ticketmaster is a big challenge, because they are in a lot of the big economies.
They are in Britain and Germany, which is a huge market for music events, so we are looking further afield and we 
are trying to steer clear of the markets they are already in. They haven't ventured into France and a few other 
countries we plan to look at."

Global shares have jumped sharply again after Apple last night announced a near doubling of profits for its latest 
quarter.
In Dublin there were rises in almost all big names. CRH is up 52c to 1625, with DCC adding 45c to 2285 and Kerry 
Group up 26c to 2755. Kingspan has risen by 12c to 671 and Smurfit Kappa is ahead by 10c to 545. The only big 
name to miss out is Ryanair, which is down 4c to 332.

Ryanair is breaking with one of the principles of the low-cost airline model by taking limited seat reservations on 
some routes.
The move will see Europe's largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers start a trial from mid-May on two routes 
out of Dublin, to London Gatwick and Malaga.
It will make 24 seats available on each 189-seat 737 aircraft, which passengers can pre-book for an extra EUR10 
each way.
The airline said it would look at rolling out pre-bookings "selectively" on other Ryanair routes depending on the 
outcome of the trial.

way for the premium service.
The system will be trialled on routes from Dublin to London Gatwick and Malaga from mid-May, with 24 seats with 
extra leg room available for pre-booking.
Also yesterday rival airline EasyJet said it was upping booking fees for credit cards to £12.95 a booking.
Ryanair charges £12 per customer.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it will that it will trial a reserved seating service on its Dublin - Malaga and 
Dublin - Gatwick routes from 16th May next.
The pre-booked service costs just E10 (each way) including priority boarding, and allows passengers to pre reserve 
seats in the front two rows, for a prompt exit on arrival, or in over wing rows (16 and 17) which provide greater 
legroom.
"Ryanair will trial a reserved seating service on our Dublin - Malaga and Dublin - Gatwick routes from 16th May 
next. For just E10 passengers can pre-book their favourite seats in the front two rows, to ensure a prompt exit on 
arrival, or in over wing exits, for extra legroom. If this new service proves popular with passengers then we will roll it 
out selectively on other Ryanair routes in the coming months," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara.

The Dublin share market lifted by 1.5pc today as investors were cheered by an upbeat mood in other centres 
across Europe.
By the close the ISEQ index had risen by 43.91 points to 2,953.39 after two previous days of losses.
What encouraged buyers in other markets was a rising demand for banks after forecast-beating results at 
JPMorgan.
Banks hardly play a big part in the Dublin market any more, but the two "pillar" banks did benefit from the mood. 
Bank of Ireland lifted by 2.5c, or 10pc, to 27.5, while AIB was up 2c, or 9pc, to 24. Among the bigger names, Smurfit 
Kappa added 10c to 930 as analysts at Bloxham predicted that the packaging giant will succeed in getting its 
custoemrs to accept a 40 euro per tonne rise in price for recycled products. In a client note today, the broker said: 
"We continue to view Smurfit kappa as an attractive play on the economic recovery given its market leader position 
in Europe." Other big gainers included CRH, ahead by 40c to 1637, bakery group Aryzta, which was ahead by 35c 
to 3615, and Ryanair, up 3c to 347. Not all the big names showed gains, however. Aidan Heavey-led oil explorer 
Tullow Oil dipped by 25c to 1602 on news that it has had to pay USD 469 million in capital gains tax to Uganda, 
where it has made big oil finds. News of the payment has emerged in an interview given by the country's junior 
finance minister Aston Kajara to a local newspaper. "It is a done deal," he told the paper. "The money was wired to 
Bank of Uganda on Friday." Tullow, which is Europe's biggest independent energy explorer, has extensive interests 
in Uganda, which it claims could prodice up to 1 billion barrels of oil. Dublin analyst Job Langbroek of Davy 
Stockbrokers noted today that the explorer is about to drill two new appraisal wells in the country. "Both wells will 
target new fault blocks," he says in a note. Drug maker Elan's shares slipped by 5 to 517 s Davy Stockbrokers 
warned that the market for multiple sclerosis drugs, including Elan's flagship Tysabri product, will become more 
crowded. The broker added, however, that iun the short term, the drug was likely to grow its user base with a big 
ISEQ closes 43 points ahead at 2,953 ISEQ Up 43
boost to Elan's profits. Insurer FBD dropped by 5 to 740 asalyst Emer Lang of Davys, who predicted that rising 
premiums after recent big weather-related payouts are unlikely to feed through into higher revenues. She forecast 
broadly flat premium revenue in 2011 "as the benefit of rate increases is offset by the effect of weak domestic 
demand". Just for a change, Bloxham Stockbrokers threw a rare eye today over a quiet backwater of the stock 
market which is bound eventually to return to growth - housebuilding. If anything is going to happen here any early 
beneficiary is likely to be Abbey, an Irish builder that has long been involved in both the Irish and British markets. 
After all, as Bloxhams pointed out, Abbey has a war chest around E100m in cash and near cash. And the British 
government is attempting to kick start the market with a number of incentives for both homebuilders and first time 
buyers. So anything doing yet? Afraid not, said Bloxhams, and there won't be until mortgages become easier to get 
and until the UK ecom=nomy sees a sustained recovery. "Both look some way off at the moment," the broker said. 
Abbey shares stayed unchanged at 520.
