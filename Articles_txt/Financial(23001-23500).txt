Body
On this subject, as the Financial Times reported this week, hundreds of website addresses that disparage Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch executives and board members have been registered in recent days in an apparent 
defensive effort to protect the bank from online attack. More than 300 addresses that mock BofA officials have been 
registered.
This is thought to be an attempt to head off online criticism after legal action over potentially fraudulent practices. 
BofA is also widely believed to be a target of WikiLeaks, which is expected to release a cache of documents related 
to banks.
Such sites are a common forum for protest by disgruntled consumers, as Michael O'Leary, chief executive of no-
frills airline carrier Ryanair, will testify.
Buying up embarrassing domain names is a normal defensive move by companies. But it is rare that they also buy 
web addresses related to executives' names.
However, the shape-shifting nature of the internet means such moves won't thwart disgruntled webbies from 
swarming to other forms of protest, as the fake Twitter account for the abortive new Gap logo proved. Facebook, for 
example, has many Bank of America discussion forums already up and running.

Body
Dublin Airport has reopened this morning after staff worked through the night to clear runways of snow and ice.
Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair say they are planning to operate their full schedules today.
They warn however that many flights may be delayed.
Both airlines are also planning a number of extra flights in the hope of working off at least some of the passenger 
backlog that has built up this week. Airport staff worked in temperatures of as low as minus 10 degrees during the 
night to get the runways operational again. Renewed snowfalls had closed them yesterday just as airlines were 
beginning to catch up on their backlog after the snowfall earlier this week. Altogether 270 flights and 40,000 
passengers were affected by yesterday's closure. All other Irish airports are also open this morning. Intending 
passengers are being advised to check the websites of their airlines before going to airports today. Rail and Luas 
services, as well as almost all bus services, are reported to be operating around the country this morning, though 
there are delays in some cases. Iarnrod Eireann says it expects to carry 300,000 people over the holiday period.

Ryanair today called on the Minister for Transport to investigate the DAA failure to keep the Dublin Airport runway 
open during the recent snow falls.
The airport closed at 9.30am and reopened at about 1pm today.
Dublin Airport Authority said staff had worked to clear accumulations of snow from the runway after braking tests 
had earlier indicated it was not safe to use.
Ryanair said that the closures of the Airport has resulted in the cancellation of over 200 Ryanair flights to/from 
Dublin affecting over 30,000 Ryanair passengers. The DAA said the closure today affected the plans of some 6,000 
people. It said airlines would work through the night to clear any backlog. He said consideration was now also being 
given to opening the airport on Christmas Day to ensure all those wishing to get into and out of the country could do 
so. "Ryanair believes that the DAA could and should be able to clear the main runway in less than one hour and not 
the four hours the DAA needed this morning," Ryaanir said.

Travel chaos eases in Europe, Heathrow still hit
Travel chaos eases in Europe, Heathrow still hit

Dateline: LONDON 
Body
Heathrow's boss announced Wednesday he would give up his hefty bonus this year after the world's busiest 
international airport was crippled by snowy conditions. Air and train travel throughout Europe finally began to return 
to normal.
Temperatures have picked up in Britain and about 70 percent of Heathrow's planned departures some 900 flights 
are expected to operate Wednesday. Airlines are trying to clear a backlog of canceled flights, after iced-over 
runways and planes triggered days of chaos and misery for those seeking to travel elsewhere for Christmas.
Heavy criticism of the airport's inability to cope with snow prompted Colin Matthews, the chief executive of operator 
BAA, to announce he would forgo his bonus and keep his focus on "keeping people moving and rebuilding 
confidence in Heathrow." It was not immediately clear what Matthew's bonus amounts to, but BAA said his salary 
and bonuses last year came to 944,000 pounds ($1.46 million).
Although many passengers finally got on the move Wednesday, some were still stranded and bitter about 
Heathrow's management.
"We kept asking questions," said Michelle Sorrell, who was hoping to finally board a plane to Australia with her 
husband and two children. "We were given some foam mattresses and a couple of blankets and the rest was up to 
us."
Airport officials placed two tents outside Terminal 3 to handle overflow passengers, but crowds were smaller and 
only one was used. Computer screens there showed 11 out of about 50 incoming flights had been canceled.
Germany's Frankfurt airport said schedules were slowly returning to normal after several days of widespread delays 
caused by winter weather. About 70 flights were canceled Wednesday out of a daily total of about 1,300, a 
substantial improvement over the 550 cancelations on Tuesday.
The French government said 15 percent of the flights from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris would be canceled 
Wednesday because of the winter weather.
Travel chaos eases in Europe, Heathrow still hit
Eurostar, which offers train services between England, France and Belgium, said routes were operating a near-
normal schedule. Still it urged only customers with tickets to show up at terminals, after facing raucous crowds of 
thousands at ticket halls earlier this week.
Extreme cold temperatures continued to plague parts of Europe.
Denmark experienced its coldest night in 29 years with -8.5 F (-22.5 C) measured in Holbaek, 40 miles (65 
kilometers) west of Copenhagen. Still, Copenhagen's international airport expected a normal day.
Snow stopped falling in Ireland at around midnight and Dublin Airport pressed hard to catch up after losing most of 
Tuesday when 90,000 tons of snow had to be cleared from the runways. Aer Lingus leased 10 additional planes to 
operate extra flights to Europe and the United States and clear the backlog of delayed customers today. Ryanair 
said its flights were at full operations.
The snow also affected Ireland's most famous rock band. U2 stars Bono and the Edge had their return from a gig in 
Australia disrupted and ended up having to take a four-hour train journey to Dublin after landing in Cork. Fellow 
passengers largely left them alone, thinking they were members of a U2 "tribute" band.
Shawn Pogatchnik in Ireland, Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.

Highlight: Costs will increase for many airlines
Opponents point to 'bonanza' for banks
Body
After 12 months of talks, officials say they have reached agreement on a groundbreaking deal that will significantly 
raise the cost of financing new passenger jets for many of the world's best-known airlines.
The new pact on export credit financing , negotiated by the European Union, the US and eight other countries 
through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is expected to be formally approved next 
month and introduced on February 1.
It follows frantic last-minute lobbying from airlines such as Ryanair, Etihad of Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg's 
Cargolux, which claim the pact is based on "arbitrary" policy-making and will create a "bonanza" for banks.
Boeing and Airbus, the world's largest aircraft makers, have also been lobbying in recent days, claiming the 
arrangements could dampen demand for their passenger jets and could lead to production cuts.
But the agreement will probably be welcomed by airlines in Europe and the US, including Lufthansa, British Airways 
and Delta, which have been unable to make use of the guarantees export credit agencies offer carriers such as 
Ryanair and Etihad to support commercial loans for aircraft purchases.
It also ends what critics say has been a market distortion that has inflated aircraft production during the global 
recession.
The deal will mean airlines using export credit agencies such as the US Export-Import Bank or France's Coface to 
help finance their passenger jets will face fees linked much closer to market rates.
Following lobbying last week by Airbus , negotiators agreed quarterly adjustments of these fees will not lead to rises 
of more than 10 per cent from the rate set in the previous quarter, officials familiar with the negotiations told the 
Financial Times.
Aircraft financing deal reached
It has also been agreed that existing, more generous export financing rules will effectively be kept in place or 
"grandfathered" for aircraft due to be delivered up until the end of 2012, to protect financing arrangements already 
negotiated.
Aircraft grandfathered in a previous 2007 deal, including some of Airbus's A380 superjumbos, will be "great-
grandfathered" in the new agreement, though small financial penalties will be applied.
The Aviation Alliance lobby group, which includes Ryanair and other airlines that have long used export credit 
financing, said the grandfathering should have been extended for at least three years through 2013, and warned 
they would keep fighting.
"If this deal goes through we will be trying to have it overturned because it is cartel pricing," said Howard Millar, 
Ryanair finance director.
The text of the agreement, which includes a February 1 starting date, is still subject to final clearance from 
governments in the US, the European Union and eight other countries that have been party to the talks. This is 
expected by January 20.
But officials close to the negotiations said on Tuesday that the resolution of final sticking points such as the 
grandfathering clauses meant agreement had effectively been reached.

Irish shares have edged higher this morning despite a blow to Greencore in the form of a rival approach to its

Greencore has slipped by 3c to 130 in early trade.
Northern Foods sought to calm fears this morning by saying it wants to stock with its Greencore merger plan.
Overall the ISEQ index of Irish shares is up 10.86 points to 2,886.42. Some of the market's biggest names 
contributed to the rise, with CRH up 15c to 1585, Ryanair lifting by 3c to 376, Kerry Group up 3c to 2573 and 
multinational baker Aryzta 3c higher at 3413. Smurfit Kappa is the morning's party pooper, with a fall of 4c to 744.

Ryanair chief financial officer and deputy chief executive Howard Millar would snap up a 199-seater aircraft 
because it hits a staffing-level "sweet spot".
"The largest aircraft that we would be interested in is 199 seats," said Millar, speaking to Flight International at 
Ryanair's Dublin headquarters. "That would mean that we could go up 10 seats without adding any more cabin 
crew."
Millar says this would make sense for incremental costs because when an aircraft goes over the 200-seat mark, 
another member of cabin crew is needed. "We think we could still do our turnarounds in 25 minutes with 199 
passengers. If someone made this aircraft, we would operate it," he says.
Today Boeing offers the 737-800 and -900, both of which are limited to 189 seats, while the Airbus A320 carries a 
maximum of 180 passengers.

Body
It's always hard to know when Michael O'Leary is being serious, and when he's just pulling the media's leg. Last 
week, he gave another interview about the future of Ryanair and his future with the airline.
The timeline for his departure from the top job, as he repeated again here, was around two to three years.
Yet, perhaps sensing that it's a better story for him to talk about leaving than about staying, he spoke at length 
about life for him and Ryanair after he leaves. But there was very little commitment to timeframes.
One of the biggest debates in the industry has been about who might succeed him when he does finally go.
He delivered what was something of a double edged compliment when he insisted that there were five or six 
internal candidates who could take on the job, but he wasn't prepared to insist that it should be an internal 
candidate at all. He went on to say that an external candidate shouldn't be ruled out.
After 17 years at the helm of the airline, O'Leary is still playing his cards astonishingly close to his chest in relation 
to his own views about a successor.
The message seems to be that there are five or six internal people capable of doing the job, but they may not get it.
Senior figures such as deputy chief executive Michael Cawley, who has been with the airline since 1997 or deputy 
chief executive Howard Millar, who has been there since 1993, shouldn't feel too put out. Based on O'Leary's 
guarded comments, one of them may still get it - and, even if they don't, they have become very wealthy men.
Neither of them is a director, so their salaries or shareholdings are not disclosed. But the eight executive officers, 
excluding O'Leary himself, collectively own around 15.2 million shares, currently valued at  57 million.
O'Leary insists he won't be hanging around on the board as a non-executive director, and that he won't be hanging 
around any other board, for that matter.
The INQUISITOR
Not getting Aer Lingus appears to rankle with him - and, given that the state will most likely flog its shareholding in 
the former state airline some time soon, O'Leary may still get what he is looking for before exiting the Ryanair 
stage.
NIB quick to own up to losses
You have to hand it to National Irish Bank.
The Danish-owned Operation was one of the first to come out early with the extent of loan losses during the early 
phases of the downturn. NIB took sizeable impairment charges early on, as a result of the losses it foresaw on 
commercial property deals.
Last week, the bank was out there once again, confirming what many suspect to be the case. Danske said that 
impairments at NIB would remain high next year as government austerity measures hurt demand.
We could all see the impact the budget will have on the wider economy and on loan losses for bank in particular.
At least Danske is getting it out there early.
A presentation on Danske's website also said that austerity in Ireland would intensify cashflow pressure in the 
commercial property market, although it said it was unlikely the economy would tip back into recession.
The austerity measures are described as dampening supply and credit demand in the residential property market.
Danske, like all the other banks, has been having a tough time in Ireland. But - unlike certain other banks closer to 
home - it has, at least, been calling it like it is for quite some time now.
EU may have to act on rating cuts
International credit rating agencies are flexing their muscles in this eurozone financial crisis like never before. These 
are the same agencies which convinced themselves a few years ago that complex bonds based on giving out 
mortgages to people in the US who clearly couldn't afford them were as good as gold bars.
Despite the setback to their credibility from the international credit crunch, the agencies are back in the driving seat 
when it comes to wielding enormous power.
Take Ireland, for example. Moody's became the latest agency to cut its credit rating for Irish sovereign borrowing 
from AA2 to BAA1 - a drop of five notches.
This has been interpreted as a clear signal that the financial markets have not bought into the idea of a successful 
economic turnaround here in the short term.
The decisions of the agencies are so influential that they will automatically lead to knock-on rating cuts for our 
banks and at least two of our state companies.
Because the banks are inextricably linked to the fortunes of the state, they continually face further rating cuts.
This decreases their ability to raise money for themselves and increases their reliance on the European Central 
Bank. The ECB has already pumped around  130 billion into Irish banks.
Another knock-on effect from the rating cut is the likely impact on the credit ratings of the Dublin Airport Authority 
(DAA) and Bord Gáis. Both have had their ratings cut in the last 12 months on foot of bonds they raised to finance 
expansion.
Any further cuts here could have implications for the price of funding should these two state companies need to 
raise more money.
The INQUISITOR
At the moment, the DAA is fully funded, and has a lot of unused cash that it had previously borrowed on its balance 
sheet. Bord Gáis has been in expansion mode and doesn't have immediate funding needs.
In reality, the state company is likely to shrink if any part of it is sold off as part of a wider privatisation plan. But the 
credit rating agencies have a very long reach.
On a much bigger scale, the possibility of a rating cut for Spanish sovereign debt poses a real threat to the survival 
of the single currency.
A rating cut for Spain could push up its cost of borrowing on ten-year bonds to more than 6 per cent.
There is a rule of thumb in sovereign debt markets that, once you breach the 6 per cent barrier, it is extremely 
difficult to get back down again.
The jumps on bond spreads get bigger above 6 per cent. In Ireland's case, it was only a matter of months after 
going above 6 per cent that Ireland ended up going to the EU/ IMF bailout fund.
In the case of Spain, the stakes are a lot higher. The EU will throw everything at preventing any possible assistance 
to Spain, should the need arise, from scuppering the single currency project. Its options are dwindling.
One option is to issue eurobonds.
That idea has been shot down. Another is to throw more money into the  744 billion bailout fund. This would be very 
risky, and while it may provide countries with access to more funds, it increases their borrowing rather than 
reducing it.
A third option would be EU sanction of restructuring and renegotiation of debt by individual nations. It is the most 
controversial option available, but it may simply have to happen.

Just after 6 o'clock on a winter's morning and the exodus is under way from Dublin's north quays.
''That's the Irish economy on the move," said Seamus McLoughlin, operations director of Dublin Port Company, as 
the trucks disembark from the Irish Ferries Ulysses and the Stena Adventurer, recently arrived from Britain. In the 
space of half an hour, a line of trucks about seven kilometres long will leave the port for destinations across the 
country.
As most people are sleeping, the port has its busiest time of day, with ships disgorging everything from supermarket 
supplies to heavy equipment, and preparing to take Ireland's exports on their journey overseas. Not long after 
8am,when the city is still coming properly to life, the giant ferries have turned around and are gone again.
''You could see anything down here," McLoughlin said, as low-loaders carry three Emerald Star cruisers aboard 
Ulysses. ''We have wind turbines, we had the steelwork for Croke Park, the roof for the Aviva Stadium, the Samuel 
Beckett Bridge.
Once, we had a Ryanair fuselage come through the port. Even Ryanair uses Dublin port."
A marine engineer who spent years at sea and then headed the Marine Casualty Investigations Board before 
joining the port, McLoughlin is passionate about the port and its role in economic life. ''Our ports - especially Dublin 
port - are critical to the competitiveness of Ireland Inc," he said. ''Nearly half of Ireland's oil imports come through 
Dublin port.
The fuel supplies for the airport come through here - if we close, the airport closes within three days."
On a day-to-day basis, there are 16 ferry sailings, as well as regular traffic from cargo vessels, oil tankers and 
cruise liners. Using a sophisticated 'just-in-time' system, many of the goods move straight from the ships and out of 
the port to their final destination, meaning there is no need for warehousing, staff and security.
Port authority
In total, 4,000 people are employed within the port's 700-acre 'estate', including about 150 directly employed by 
Dublin Port Company.
The port houses activities as diverse as flour milling by Odlums, concrete making by Ecocem and scrap metal 
processing by Hammond Lane.
Bord na Móna has a large facility for peat, which is exported to the Netherlands for flower growing, while GPS-
controlled containers, cars and wind turbine components are spread through the port area.
''We're a trade facilitator at the heart of the largest market on the island, and trade is still flowing.
We don't have roads or tunnels to our main markets, so we have to make this bit work well," said McLoughlin.
Despite the pressure on the economy, the port ''bit'' is working well - total throughput has risen about 7 per cent this 
year, which should leave it not far off a record high of 31 million tons at the height of the boom in 2007.
''We started to notice the downturn in 2008, but things started to pick up a year ago and trade through the port has 
been up every month since then," he said. ''The export-led recovery is happening on the ground and there has been 
a shift upwards in imports.
There is damn-all wrong with the economy if we didn't have the [problems with the] banks."
McLoughlin credited some of the growth at the port to a move to boost competition down at the docks.
The Dublin Port Company once employed more than 460 people and ran all the activities in the port directly, but 
now licenses the operations to private sector operators such as Irish Ferries, Stena, P&O, Seatruck And DFDS.
''We exited services that we weren't doing efficiently, and got ourselves lean and fit. Now we have eight competing 
operator terminals within the port. There is intense competition, and importers and exporters have a choice."
Despite the downturn, the Dublin Port Company turned in an after-tax profit of  14.5 million last year on turnover of  
62.9 million. It paid a dividend of  5.3 million to the government, leaving it with shareholders' funds of  225 million at 
the end of 2009.
This year was busy on several fronts, with continuing investment, record cruise liner traffic and a boost in 
passenger numbers when the volcanic ash cloud closed airports earlier this year.
Work started recently on a 1.6-kilometre extension to the port's rail line, which is used by firms such as Coca-Cola 
and Tara Mines.
Cargo trains carry Coke's concentrate from Ballina in Co Mayo to the port five days a week, bound for destinations 
all around the world.
Tara Mines, which is owned by Swedish firm Boliden, moves more than 400,000 tons of lead and zinc a year by rail 
from Navan in Co Meath, through the port, and on to Norway and Finland.
''We have other companies interested in moving cargo by rail. Dublin is at the heart of the national rail network and 
we are trying to drive the use of rail. An 18-carriage cargo train takes 36 trucks off the road," said McLoughlin.
At the other end of the scale, the port had 88 cruise liner visits this year, carrying 87,500 passengers and 40,000 
crew.
There were three 'turnaround' visits, when a cruise started or finished in Dublin, which means people tend to spend 
more time and money in the city. Next year, the port is forecasting 90 cruise liners with 130,000 passengers and 
crew.
Regular passenger traffic is also strong, according to McLoughlin.
Port authority
About 1.1million passengers pass through each year, but more than 72,000 went through in a single week this year 
when the airports were closed. ''Not one passenger was left behind," said McLoughlin, who believes some of those 
people have since become repeat users of the port. ''People going to Britain are choosing the ferry over the hassle 
of going through the airport."
That said, McLoughlin said he was glad that ports didn't get the same attention as airports. ''Look at all the hoo haa 
over Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.
We've been doing all sorts of developments and nobody bats an eyelid - over the past 15 years, we've invested  
300 million in infrastructure," he said.
Port traffic is handled by a sophisticated vessel traffic management service, similar to an air traffic control centre. It 
is staffed by trained professionals who are former seafarers.
A  3 million CCTV system covers the port with 100 cameras, and the port can be shut down in one minute in the 
event of an emergency or security breach.
Big-ticket items include huge two-tier ramps that allow ferries to be loaded and unloaded more quickly.
Three of those have been installed at a cost of about  20 million each, and there is ongoing investment in cranes.
The port has also spent  16 million on a new fleet of boats, including  12 million on two tug boats called Shackleton 
and Beaufort.
Two pilot boats, Camac and Liffey, were built by Safehaven Boats in Cork at a cost of  1.25 million, while almost  
2.7 million was spent on Rosbeg, a ''Swiss Army knife boat'' with a crane, winches and other maintenance 
equipment.
''Money spent on infrastructure is money well spent," said McLoughlin, a self-confessed ''nuts-and-bolts type'' who 
is a fan of big projects such as the Port Tunnel and the M50.
''They are the most fantastic assets," he said.
But if the Celtic tiger allowed those projects to go ahead, McLoughlin was glad that the downturn had all but killed 
off talk of moving the port further up the coast.
''People wanted this out of here so they could build yuppie flats on it, but nobody spoke to Dublin port about it.
''If you look at the logistics of moving a port, why on earth would you do it?"

The IMF's assessment that Ireland will struggle to pay back its E85 billion bailout loan coupled with a massive 
downgrade and negative outlook from Moody's send irish shares sharply lower today.
The International Monetary Fund warned today that Ireland faced significant risks that could affect its ability to repay 
an aid loan, and it forecast the country would miss achieving a 3pc deficit of GDP by 2015. The IMF made the 
comments in a staff report issued a day after it approved a 22.5 billion euro loan for Ireland as part of an 85 billion 
euro rescue bailout package. The rest of the bailout, put together after a banking crisis brought the former "Celtic 
Tiger" economy to its knees, includes 45 billion euros from Europe and 17.5 billion euros which Ireland will 
contribute itself. "The pace of recovery is projected to be modest. Downside risks are significant, stemming from 
deflationary tendencies, overstretched balance sheets and adverse fiscal and financial feedback loops," the IMF 
said in its latest staff report. "There are significant risks to the programme that could affect Ireland's capacity to 
repay the Fund," the IMF said in a Dec. 8 document outlining an assessment of risks to the world body from bailing 
out Ireland.
Today's assessment of the Irish economy and its ability to hit targets and repay the EU/IMF loan by the IMF is 
"baffling", according to NCB economist, Brian Devine. "Just when we thought things would end the week on a 
decent note for the Irish economy after yesterday's increase in Q3 GNP by +1.1pc q/q, the IMF released their 
assessment of the Irish economy," he said.
Bank shares suffered as a result with AIB down 1c to E0.44, Bank of Ireland dropped 5c to E0.32 and Irish Life and 
Permanent declined 9c to E0.96. Goodbody Stockbrokers has produced some stock predictions for the New Year. 
Its key picks in the year ahead, on the basis of market capitalisation are; Ryanair, Dragon Oil, Travis Perkins, 
Aryzta, DCC, Paddy Power and FBD. Ryanair fell 2c to E3.74, Dragon dipped 7c to E5.78, Aryzta jumped 25c to 
E33.25, DCC rose 36c to E22.36, Paddy Power rose 10c to E30.29 and FBD rose 8c to E6.05. One of the key

takeaways from the recent Investor Days held by CRH management in London and New York was that with 
markets stabilising there is more comfort in pursuing acquisitions, as a result there is a lot more active engagement 
going on, particularly in US materials. Therefore, there is an expectation that deal-flow will pick-up from the lows of 
circa E450m last year, according to Goodbody's. CRH's shares fell 17c to E15.21. In their monthly update on PML - 
a degenerative brain condition some of those who took MS drug, Tysabri, contracted - Biogen Idec and Elan have 
noted that four new cases have been detected in the month, bringing the total to 79 since the drug returned to 
market. One more patient has died, bringing the total up to 16, or 20pc of those who have contracted the condition. 
Over the year, the monthly increase in cases has averaged 4.25. Elan's shares fell 3c to E4.40.

The ISEQ turned negative after a mostly sustained ten day rally after global ratings agency, Moody's, slashed 
Ireland debt rating and bank shares plunged.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 4.63 points to 2,834.69.
Moody's cut its credit rating on Ireland by five notches from Aa2 to Baa1 because of increasing uncertainties over 
the country's economy and public finances. Moody's also said the Baa1 rating outlook is negative. The move 
follows a cut from Fitch last week. It cut Ireland's rating by three notches from 'A+' to 'BBB+'. It said the downgrade 
reflects the additional costs of restructuring and supporting the bank system as well as weaker prospects and 
greater uncertainty on the economy. Moody's said its downgrade reflected the problems in the Irish banking system, 
the 'increased uncertainty regarding the country's economic outlook; and the decline in the Irish Government's 
financial strength'.
Bank shares suffered as a result with AIB down 2c to E0.44, Bank of Ireland dropped 3c to E0.34 and Irish Life and 
Permanent declined 8c to E0.97. Goodbody Stockbrokers has produced some stock predictions for the New Year. 
Its key picks in the year ahead, on the basis of market capitalisation are; Ryanair, Dragon Oil, Travis Perkins, 
Aryzta, DCC, Paddy Power and FBD. Ryanair fell 1c to E3.75, Dragon dipped 1c to E5.85, Aryzta jumped 30c to 
E33.30, DCC rose 10c to E22.10, Paddy Power rose 1c to E30.20 and FBD rose 1c to E5.98. One of the key 
takeaways from the recent Investor Days held by CRH management in London and New York was that with 
markets stabilising there is more comfort in pursuing acquisitions, as a result there is a lot more active engagement 
going on, particularly in US materials. Therefore, there is an expectation that deal-flow will pick-up from the lows of

Airbus in late plea on export financing
Airbus in late plea on export financing

Body
Airbus has made a last-ditch appeal to Germany, France and the UK to water down an export financing deal that 
would make it more expensive for many airlines to buy the aircraft maker's passenger jets.
In a move that puts the Toulouse-based manufacturer at odds with some of its biggest airline customers, Tom 
Enders, chief executive, wrote this week to governments in each country urging them to modify the impact of an 
international agreement being discussed in Paris today.
Airbus has plants in all three nations.
A draft of the new agreement shows airlines that finance their jets with support from export credit agencies, such as 
France's Coface or Germany's Euler Hermes, face a rise in the fees they pay for guarantees provided for 
commercial loans taken out for jet purchases.
The fees, which would vary according to an airline's credit profile, would be adjusted quarterly in an effort to make 
them better reflect market conditions.
Mr Enders said Airbus, a unit of the EADS aerospace and defence group, wanted any quarterly movements in the 
fees to be capped to make sure they did not rise more than 10 per cent from the rate set the previous quarter.
He also urged the governments to make sure current, more generous export financing rules, be kept in place or 
"grandfathered" for aircraft due to be delivered up until December 2012 at the earliest.
In a further sign of the controversy surrounding the new rules, Ryanair, Emirates and other airlines in a lobby group 
that use export guarantees, were on Thursday night preparing to write a separate letter urging that the higher fees 
not to be applied to aircraft delivered within the next three years.
Export credit guarantees have been a boon to many airlines, especially during the credit crisis when commercial 
loans became expensive and scarce, leading export credit financing to soar to record levels.
Airbus in late plea on export financing
However, airlines based in the home countries of Airbus and its US rival, Boeing - including Delta, Air France and 
British Airways - cannot get such financial support to buy their jets.
They have lobbied for it to be made more expensive to end what they say is a damaging market distortion that gives 
an unfair advantage to fast-growing rivals such as Emirates and Ryanair.
Airbus said there were several problems with the draft under discussion in Paris this week that would make it 
"unworkable" for airlines.
If the agreement is approved as it stands, "there is a danger it could produce a degree of nervousness in the market 
as to how much financing is going to cost", Airbus pointed out.

Ryanair today dismissed rumours that it might bid for Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
"While Ryanair is interested in a low fares transatlantic service it has no intention of bidding for a high fares airline," 
it said today.
Ryanair said it has received a number of calls in recent days from analysts and media linking it with the UK airline 
as speculation builds about a re-organisation at Virgin Atlantic.
"In business as in life Virgin will have many pursuers but Ryanair will not be one of them. While Ryanair has a long 
stated plan to enter the transatlantic market with a revolutionary really low fares service we are too busy screwing 
Air France, BA and Lufthansa to waste time on a high fare Virgin," Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said. Virgin 
Atlantic said this week it had received several "lines of enquiry" about tie-ups with rival carriers after it hired 
Deutsche Bank to assess the aviation market. "Following Deutsche Bank's recent appointment, we have received a 
number of lines of enquiry but it is far too early to comment on individual details," Virgin said in a statement. "We 
expect Deutsche Bank's work to run on for a number of months but have nothing further to add at this stage."

   Dec. 16, 2010 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
Flybe Group plc, Britains largest domestic airline and Europes largest regional carrier which just went public, has a 
famous investor “ billionaire hedge-fund manager/financier George Soros has invested 7.2-million pounds sterling 
into the company
Soros made the acquisition through this Quantum Partners investment firm, providing him a 3.4 percent stake in the 
carrier, reportedly making him Flybes fourth-largest investors.
The biggest investor, the family of founder Jack Walker, owns 49 percent, followed by British Airways, which has 15 
percent; and Flybe management, led by chief executive Jim French, who together own 7 percent.
The company raised about 66-million pounds (including exercise of the over-allotment) in its London offering and is 
widely seen a giving a boost to Britains IPO market which has endured a disappointing year.
The airline said it will use half the proceeds of the offering to fund fleet expansion, with the remainder to be used to 
finance œgrowth opportunities, including potential acquisitions in mainland Europe.
The company is now engaged in talks to offer œfeeder services: to the hubs of major European carriers. In July, 
Flybe had entered into a code-sharing agreement with Air France-KLM. (NYSE:AKH WS)  (OOTC:AFLYY) 
CEO French has stated he wants Flybe to remain an independent operator, in cooperative deals with as many 
European airlines as possible.
œWere not going into Europe to challenge Ryanair, EasyJet and Air France, French said. œWe have a substantial 
airline that can give a lot of feed into the hubs, but were not a subsidiary of anybody. We set out to create this new 
Soros invests in Britains largest domestic airline
generation of regional airline that took the key elements of the legacy carriers and the key elements of the low-cost 
carriers.
In November 1983 British businessman Jack Walker acquired control of Jersey European Airways and later 
rebranded itself as Flybe in 2002.
Flybe became Britains top domestic carrier in 2007 when it completed the acquisition of British Airwayss BA 
Connect unit for 521 million pounds, which added more than 50 routes and doubled its number of customers.

The ISEQ slipped further in to negative territory today as bank shares were mostly weak ahead of what will be a 
total transformation of the Irish financial sector under the terms of the EU / IMF bailout.
The index fell 8.03 points to 2,830.45.
Next year will see a massive shrinkage in the size and scope of Ireland's surviving - and largely State owned - 
banks. The Dail votes today on the Credit Institutions Bill and the EU IMF bailout. The proposed Credit Institutions 
Bill outlines a range of measures allowing the Minster for Finance to enforce burden-sharing by way of a 
'subordinated liabilities order' on junior debt. The Minister will pursue such an order if it is deemed necessary for 
preserving or restoring the financial position of the relevant institution, with the consequence of affecting (including 
reducing) the rights of subordinated creditors existing before the order. The bill is to be debated later today and is 
expected to be enacted by the end of this week. The exceptional powers contained in the bill would extend until the 
December 31st 2012.
Shares in AIB rose 3c to E0.47, Bank of Ireland dropped 2c to E0.39 and Irish Life and Permanent lost 2c to E1.11. 
European stocks lost ground on the day, halting a brisk two-week rally after Moody's put Spain on review for a 
possible downgrade, reviving euro-zone debt jitters and dragging down the euro. The STOXX banking sector index, 
down nearly 9pc on the year, took another beating today, falling 2.1pc, with Banco Santander losing 3.4pc, 
UniCredit falling 3.1pc, Barclays dropping 2.8pc and Credit Agricole falling 2.5pc. Due to the imposition of the new 
travel tax in Germany (E8), Ryanair has announced further cuts there. It is reducing capacity in Berlin by 56pc (122 
weekly flights, four routes), Bremen by 29pc (58 weekly flights, eight routes) and Dusseldorf Weeze by 21pc (84 
weekly flights, 13 routes). Reductions at Frankfurt Hahn comprise 150 weekly flights and nine routes. The 30pc cut 
in Frankfurt Hahn flights (from 11 to eight based aircraft) was announced in October. Shares in Ryanair fell 3c to

half to the year due to an increase in the number of projects, the pipeline has softened slightly, which will constrain 
the division in 2011. Shares in Kingspan rose 9c to E6.67. Domestic cement sales in Poland increased by 11.6pc in 
November year-on-year (yoy), according to latest data from the Polish Cement Association. This leaves year-to-

market: Lafarge (c.23pc market share), Heidelbergcement (c.20pc) and CRH (c.16pc), according to Davy 
Research. CRH shares fell 35c to E15.25. Siteserv has reported (December 15th) an operating profit of E4.64m for

Airlines around the world face a sharp rise in the cost of buying passenger jets under new export financing rules to 
be discussed by government officials in Paris this week, confidential documents prepared for their meeting reveal.
The rules would mean many airlines that have long used export credit agencies to help finance some of their jets 
will encounter higher upfront fees.
The plan represents a victory for 24 US and European airlines that cannot get export credit agency (ECA) loan 
guarantees themselves, because they are based in countries where the big jetmakers manufacture aircraft. The 
little-known agreement, called the home country rule, affects airlines based in France, the UK, Germany, Spain and 
the US where either Airbus or Boeing make aircraft.
The rules, which are intended to come into force as early as January once approved, will vary financing fees 
according to the credit rating of the airline and prevailing market conditions.
If the rules were in place today, airlines with strong credit profiles, such as Emirates and Ryanair, would have to pay 
nearly 8 per cent of the value of the debt raised to buy an aircraft, or roughly twice the current charge. They would 
also face lower loan-to-value ratios.
Many of these airlines, which also include Korean Air and Virgin Blue, last month announced they had formed a 
rival lobby group that backs an end to the home market rule, but opposed more expensive ECA financing.
Both sides have focused their efforts on negotiations for a new international aircraft financing deal that has been 
overseen over the past year by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The initial group of 24 US and European airlines have lobbied their respective governments about changing the 
rules for months, claiming they have been "profoundly threatened" by a "flood" of export credit backing for profitable 
and fast-growing foreign rivals.
Airlines face rise in cost of buying jets
This group has urged governments to impose less attractive terms on export credit support, which ballooned to 
record levels last year as commercial bank financing dried up in the credit crunch and became cheaper than 
commercial loans.
Their efforts have unsettled Boeing, which, like Airbus, has benefited from ECA support for leading airline 
customers.

The fight between established carriers and newer arrivals is driving debate, writes Pilita Clark
Body
There are more than 40 pages in the draft international aircraft financing agreement that officials from the US, 
Europe, Japan and elsewhere are due to finalise in Paris this week.
Filled with legal and financial jargon, the document does not make easy reading, starting with its title: Sector 
Understanding on Export Credits for Civil Aircraft.
But the new international system of export financing rules that it sets out lies at the heart of what is fast becoming 
one of the most significant aviation battles in years: the growing competition between older flag carriers in the US 
and Europe, and newer rivals such as Dubai's Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi's Etihad.
Until recently, global aviation rules locked such newcomers out of the world's biggest aviation markets in North 
America and Europe. But spreading deregulation has allowed them steadily to become a noticeable presence in 
their rivals' backyards.
In the UK, for example, the hulking form of an Emirates A380, the world's largest passenger jet, is a familiar feature 
not just at Heathrow airport in London, but in regional cities such as Manchester, where the airline opened a new 
superjumbo service earlier this year.
The prospect of Emirates using the 90 superjumbos it has ordered to transform the long distance international 
market in the way that Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair has remodelled short-haul flying, has alarmed many 
established airlines.
But they have become even more irate after seeing Emirates, Ryanair and many other profitable airlines accessing 
export credit agency support that they themselves could not use because of the so-called home country rule, which 
prevents airlines in Boeing and Airbus countries from getting ECA backing.
Old guard faces battle on jet finance
The issue became more heated after the credit crunch saw government-backed export support swell to record 
levels - and become cheaper than commercial loans.
Emirates and Ryanair have formed a lobby group to argue that while they have used ECA financing for some of 
their fleets, it is not as cheap as some claim, they still use commercial financing for many jets, and older airlines 
should not blame this for problems in their own businesses.
They said they would happily see an end to the home country rule, but insist ECA support should be maintained as 
it is.
They have been up against a formidable lobbying effort, however.
British Airways joined forces earlier this year with eight other European airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France-
KLM, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, and 15 US carriers, including American Airlines, Delta and Southwest. They 
argued a new aircraft financing deal being negotiated through the OECD should address what they described as 
severe "market distortion" by imposing higher ECA fees and lower loan-to-value ratios.
The draft of the new agreement shows the lobbying has partly paid off: upfront minimum fees for ECA financing 
have been raised according to airlines' credit ratings, ranging from 7.74 per cent for carriers with strong ratings, to 
as much as 14.77 per cent for CC to C-rated carriers. Loan-to-value ratios have been lowered.
These measures effectively blunt the impact of the home market rule, which is not formally part of the OECD 
negotiations, making it less of an issue.
The 24 airlines did not get all they wanted. They had argued for a cap on export credit volumes, for instance. But 
officials shied away from such a step as they tried to steer a course that would end what one person familiar with 
the negotiations described as the "gravy train" of cheap export credit financing in the credit crunch, while keeping 
ECA financing available for the emerging market airlines it was always intended to support.
In essence, the new agreement, which replaces an older one signed in 2007, tries to make the cost of ECA 
financing expensive enough to encourage financially strong airlines to use commercial lenders, but not so 
unattractive that it could hurt all airlines.
All of which means this week's meetings at the OECD's Paris offices, where the draft agreement is due to be 
finalised, are likely to be one of the aviation world's most closely watch- ed events in some time.

The problem
Last week, watchmaker Hublot published an ad with the beaten-up face of Formula One's Bernie 
Ecclestone and the tagline: "See what people will do for a Hublot" . Critics said it was poor taste, while the 
company argued it was highlighting a serious issue at the victim's behest. How should companies link to 
unfortunate events?
The advice
The executive Barbara Stocking On sensitive subjects ethics are key. Companies must examine what outcome 
they are hoping to achieve from their campaign or action - grabbing attention is just step one. So people feel moved 
or even outraged by what they see? That reaction isn't useful unless they then feel compelled to do something 
positive about it. Guilt will not garner long-term support.
In Oxfam's case, an impulsive reaction to a shocking image may propel someone to donate money but will 
generally be a one-off result. When we are trying to engage with the public - to raise funds for an emergency 
response or to build support for a campaign - we let them know that there is something constructive they can do. 
Oxfam wants to show that human suffering can be alleviated, so we do not appeal to guilt but to hope. The writer is 
chief executive of Oxfam
The branding expert Rita Clifton Every brand needs to stay relevant and current. Using topical events to remind 
consumers of your brand's advantages can be a good route. But it depends who is doing it and how.
Some brands are able to take more risks than others. No one expects Ryanair to act in the best possible taste when 
it does anything - cheapness is core to its brand. It has used fear of terrorism and, more recently, the case of a 
passenger allegedly performing a sexual act on himself during an Aer Lingus flight in its own marketing. In contrast, 
Benetton's decision in the early 1990s to use the image of a man dying of Aids as a topical advertising vehicle did 
not work for the brand and was cynically received.
Who dares wins. Sometimes, anyway. The writer is chairman of Interbrand London
Should companies use sensitive events in their advertising?
The academic Rohit Deshpande The Hublot ad is in poor taste, is bad marketing, and creates the wrong kind of 
long-term consumer impression because it contravenes three principles of branding. First, advertising is judged not 
only in the market but in the court of public opinion. This ad raises the issue of Hublot exploiting the serious issue of 
violence. Second, corporate advertising should focus on strategy. Hublot has historically differentiated itself through 
innovative technology, but this ad says nothing about this brand heritage. Third, reputations are built on consumer 
goodwill. Hublot built this in part through its founder's focus on philanthropy. This ad risks creating a disconnect for 
consumers who are knowledgeable of Hublot's history. The writer is professor of marketing at Harvard 
Business School

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Tuesday announced additional cuts to its 
summer 2011 schedule for flights and traffic in its German operations in response to German government's 
introduction of tourist tax of 8 euros foreseeing damages in traffic.
The Irish airline said the new tax will result in a total loss of 3 million passengers and 3,000 jobs in 2011 at airports 
in Berlin, Bremen, Dusseldorf Weeze and Frankfurt Hahn. The company will cancel 414 weekly flights and 34 
routes. Ryanair also stated that it will move these aircraft to bases outside Germany.
The company will cancel 122 weekly flights and 4 routes from its summer 2011 schedule in Berlin, and it will reduce 
traffic by 900 thousands passengers per annum with the loss of 900 jobs. The company also plans to cancel 58 
weekly flights and 8 routes next year in Bremen. This will slash 400 jobs and 400 thousands passengers annually.
Further, Ryanair said it expects a job loss of 700 in Düsseldorf Weeze and a traffic reduction of 700 thousand 
passengers per annum, by canceling 84 weekly flights and 13 routes. At Frankfurt Hahn, 150 weekly flights and 9 
routes will be canceled, resulting in reduction of 1 million passengers annually with the loss of 1,000 jobs.
The company said the new tax makes Germany an uncompetitive tourist destination while many other EU 
countries, including Holland, Belgium, Greece and Spain, have scrapped tourist taxes or reduced airport charges in 
order to grow traffic and tourism. Last week, the Irish government slashed its 10 euros tourist tax to just 3 euros in 
2011, after recognizing the damage it had done to Irish tourism and jobs.
Commenting the flights and traffic reduction, Ryanair's Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary stated, 
"International experience shows that tourist taxes cause a large traffic and tourism collapses in both Ireland and the 
UK and we believe that this ill advised ?8 tourist tax will inflict similar damage to German tourism and jobs."
For the month of November, the airline's traffic was up 2% to 5.06 million while load factor remained flat with the 
prior-year month's 80%.
RYAAY closed Monday's trading at $30.55, up $0.24, on a volume of 562,700 shares.
RYA.L is trading at 3.76 pence on the LSE, down 0.0640 pence or 1.67%, on 1.12 million shares.

Ryanair today said that it will take legal action again Spanish unions, AENA, AESA and the USCA who it says are 
responsible for the "unlawful wildcat air traffic control (ATC) disruption in Spain on Fri 3rd and Sat 4th December".
The Irish airline said this caused the cancellation of over 500 Ryanair flights, disrupting over 75,000 passengers.
Ryanair once again called for the EU Commission to remove the 'right to strike' from essential services such as 
ATC and to reform the EU261 passenger rights legislation.
So far in 2010, Ryanair has been forced to cancel 2,500 flights and delay over 13,000 flights, disrupting over 2.5m 
passengers, as a direct result of Belgian, French and Spanish ATC strikes and work to rules, it said. "Under EU261 
regulations airlines suffer the costs of these disruptions without any recourse against those unions calling strikes or 
the EU Govts who own the ATCs and repeatedly allow European airspace to be closed." "How many more times 
will Europe's airlines and their passengers be disrupted by unnecessary airspace closures, strikes and work to rules 
before the EU Commission finally takes some action? Striking ATC staff are the modern equivalent of highwaymen. 
They don't care about consumers, they don't care about passengers, and they repeatedly strike because they know 
they can shut down Europe's skies and hold EU Governments and passengers to ransom. It is unacceptable that 
Spanish Air Traffic Controllers, some of whom earn almost E1 million per year, continue to engage in strikes, go 
slows and work to rules, causing delays and misery for millions of European passengers without any financial 
ramifications. Ryanair will now take legal action against those responsible for the wildcat Air Traffic Control strikes 
which caused the cancelation of 500 Ryanair flights on the 3rd and 4th of December," said Ryanair's Stephen 
McNamara.

Western airlines are trying to divert attention from their structural failings by deepening a dispute over the funding 
advantages of fast-growing Middle Eastern carriers, said James Hogan, chief executive of Abu Dhabi's Etihad 
Airways.
Mr Hogan's remarks hit back at Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways, who says European export credit 
agencies are unfairly subsidising the growth of airlines such as Etihad and Emirates.
Mr Hogan argued that this was misleading, saying western airlines were falling behind because of agreements with 
unions, outdated infrastructure and hubs that were poorly located to tap Asia's booming economies.
Some 24 US and European airlines complain they are hobbled by a rule, dating back to the 1980s, that countries 
where Boeing and Airbus build aircraft - the US, UK, France, Germany and Spain - cannot use export credit 
agencies to help their airlines buy passenger airliners. The western airlines want their governments to drop this so-
called home market rule , then put a 20 per cent cap on export financing for aircraft purchases and increase the 
costs of such funding.
"What European legacy carriers are doing here is muddying the water," Mr Hogan told the Financial Times in an 
interview in Seoul, to which Etihad is starting daily flights.
"Why do people such as ourselves have a competitive advantage? We are seven years old; we are not a legacy 
carrier. I am not bound by union agreements that may be 25 or 30 years old. I am not bound by infrastructure that 
may have been right for 30 years ago."
He added that western carriers were not adapting very quickly to building fleets for new hubs that focused on 
booming Asian economies.
Etihad chief hits back in airline funding dispute
"There's an economic shift. Whereas the European hubs were at the centre of the aviation world, today they are at 
the end of it," he said. "Their networks rely on feeding into London, Frankfurt or Paris. That's a competitive issue, a 
structural address. So address it. It is not to do with us getting a form of credit."
Mr Hogan said he was happy for western countries to drop the home market rule, levelling the field on export 
finance, but that he opposed the further restrictions proposed by western airlines. Etihad has joined nine other 
airlines including Ryanair, Emirates and Korean Air in forming the Aviation Alliance. This group is protesting at 
moves to put a cap on export financing and charge more for it. Mr Hogan said 15 per cent of his funding came from 
export credit. He said these agencies made the same "gruelling, strong" demands on his business plans as would 
normal banks.

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 508 words
Body
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
To raise a lot of our funding, to set our strategic direction with the support of my board and to motivate and support 
my team.
I also need to find time to do consultancy work to support myself financially and I am a single parent to a 18-month 
old baby boy, so every day is actionpacked.
What are your primary professional motivators?
A belief that everyone deserves dignity and the ability to feed and educate their children. I am a chartered 
accountant and worked for 12 years in corporate finance as a director with Ernst & Young and before that as 
associate.
I set up Foundation Nepal in late 2006.
In the areas where we work, 65 per cent of children suffer from malnutrition, the average per capita income is  70- 
80 per annum and it is a 15-day trek over some of the highest mountain ranges in the world to reach a hospital.
Our mission is to give a hand up, not a hand out, by investing in local people and infrastructure, combined with 
economic development, to give people the means to support themselves.
We aim to be the Ryanair of the charity world, using an ultra low cost model.
We are working to develop an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to eliminate extreme poverty which can be rolled 
out anywhere in the world.
How would you describe your work style?
Working Week
Direct to the point of bluntness, appreciative, fair and exacting.
What would you rate as the best decision you ever made in business?
To leave the corporate world behind.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learnt so far?
Tenacity. If you keep pushing at that boulder, you will eventually get it to the top of the mountain.
Last year, on a budget of  134,588,we treated 29,440 patients at our health posts, delivered healthcare and hygiene 
training to 5,581 people and completed the building of a school for 300 students.
We also purchased education materials for 1,500 children, trained 670 mothers in agri-business and ran pilot 
programmes in agri-business with 245 households in three villages, which increased average household income by 
10-27 per cent in the first year.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
I admire Padraig O'Ceidigh, chairman of Aer Arann.
He is a fighter and a man of great integrity.
He also has vision and is testament to the idea that nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it.
Of course, there will be adversity, but adversity offers opportunity.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
I hope that things improve, as the recession has made it much more difficult to secure donations for our work.
This recession cannot go on forever and, if the US can turn the corner more convincingly, this should provide a 
foundation for an Irish recovery.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
To use my skills to help those families who have no voice to live with dignity and hope and to sleep peacefully at 
night.
At Foundation Nepal, our aim is to progress our existing development programme from the pilot stage to a more 
intensive phase, which is dependent on raising additional funds.

European equity markets may have suffered enough,  writes Michael Stothard .
Investors are now looking for bargains. One strategy is to buy companies listed in peripheral eurozone economies 
like Ireland, but which do not have much of their business there.
Ryanair is seen as one such stock, falling 7 per cent since November, but with a business that is only loosely linked 
to the Irish economy.
There was turmoil in the European markets last month, with banking stocks falling nearly 9 per cent. Stocks have 
broadly recovered, but the areas most exposed to the sovereign crisis are still lagging behind.
Spain's Ibex 35 index has a historic price-to-earnings ratio of 9.6, arguably looking cheap compared with Germany's 
Xetra Dax index which has a p/e of 14.7.
"Some companies are fundamentally quite solid and are being dragged down unfairly due to where they are listed, 
but we would not broadly jump on this theme," said Matthias Joerss at Macquarie Capital.

From Mr Stephen Hazell-Smith.
Sir, May I put in a plea that you do not do to Philip Stephens ("Clegg learns the lessons of a breach of trust", 
December 7) the FT equivalent of Ryanair sending Captain Morgan Fischer to Lithuania ?
You must regard as treasonous talk his temerity in writing that "there could scarcely be a better example of such 
inter-generational selfishness than reducing spending on education while protecting benefits for the affluent elderly" 
when the FT editorial line (also December 7) is that a vote to increase university fees is a vote to maintain Britain's 
world class education system.

The ISEQ powered ahead to its highest level in weeks today as the details of the 2011 austerity Budget became 
known and amid hopes that some semblance of stability will ensue.
The index rose 47.47 points to 2,799.
The euro rose on optimism Ireland will pass an austerity budget later in the day, though support was expected to be 
fleeting, with the single currency still dogged by structural weaknesses in the euro zone. European shares hit a 26-
month high on Tuesday, with commodity issues gaining on strong crude and metals prices and as a deal to extend 
U.S. tax cuts helped lift confidence in the economy. U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday unveiled a 
compromise deal to extend all Bush-era tax cuts for two years, not just for the middle class, but also for wealthier 
Americans, in a move seen as helping to spur consumer spending.
Bank shares surged higher with AIB up 7c to E0.45, Bank of Ireland climbed 5c to E0.42 while Irish Life and 
Permanent jumped 9c to E1.11. Reports suggest that JC Flowers may be interested in investing in Irish assets. The 
reports suggest that founder J Christopher Flowers believes a stake in Allied Irish Banks or Bank of Ireland may be 
attractive, depending on government guarantees on potential losses from toxic assets, but that buying asset 
portfolios at discounts with government support might be a more appealing investment in the short term. Air travel 
tax was reduced to E3 in the budget. The change in tack is in response to a collapse in tourism - the number of 
visitors to Ireland in the first nine months of this year was 4.6m, down 16pc. Traffic through Dublin airport is 
expected to be only c.18.5m passengers this year. Separately, it has also emerged that the Dublin Airport Authority 
is to re-launch a route incentive scheme and rebates for airlines on passenger charges when the number of 
travellers using the three airports (Cork, Shannon, Dublin) hits a certain level (possibly set at the 2010 level). New 
route launches may receive a 100pc discount in year one of the route. Shares in Ryanair was flat at E3.82 and Aer 
Lingus gained 2c to E1.08. Centrica, the British utility, has bought JK Environmental Services for a total

consideration of £7m including debt and leasing liabilities. JK Environmental Services, like DCC's UK hazardous 
waste operations, offers drain and tank cleaning services to the commercial and industrial sectors. Shares in DCC 
climbed 8c to E21.10. Shares in CRH jumped 61c to E15.18 amid hopes that the US economy will perk up next 
year thanks to stimuli packages from the Obama administration. Grafton peer, Wolseley has reported that like for 
like sales in the UK grew by 5pc in the first quarter, which is similar to what was achieved in the fourth quarter. This 
is consistent with the recent update from Grafton, which showed that momentum had continued into October (UK

Ryanair pilot who crossed O'Leary quits

Highlight: Lithuania posting 'a kick in the teeth'
Body
The Ryanair pilot who said the airline should replace Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, with a junior flight 
attendant to save money has quit after being reassigned from southern France to the "Siberia" of a base in 
Lithuania.
Captain Morgan Fischer was one of almost 30 Ryanair pilots working at Marseilles who had to move after the airline 
announced in October it was closing the base in a disagreement with French authorities.
The pilots were asked to bid for new bases. Most did so and were offered work at bases in Spain, Italy, Portugal 
and elsewhere, including some a few hours' drive from Marseilles, where many live with their families.
Capt Fischer, who had worked for Ryanair for almost five years and had spent almost a year resolving a contractual 
dispute with the airline, said he wanted to discuss any move first, according to a close colleague. This was because 
he was concerned the low-cost carrier could treat a request to shift bases as an agreement to a new, and possibly 
inferior, contract.
The 41-year-old American, who lives with his family in the pretty town of Aix-en-Provence, was then offered a 
transfer to Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city.
"That was a fairly considerable kick in the teeth for him," said the colleague. "Kaunas is considered Siberia for 
Ryanair pilots. It's very unpopular to be sent there. It's the back of nowhere with a completely different language. 
You're in eastern Europe and the money is dreadfully bad."
As a result, Capt Fischer resigned. He declined to comment, but speaking from France, his colleague said the pilot 
had the option of going back to work for a US airline.
Ryanair pilot who crossed O'Leary quits
Capt Fischer's resignation comes two months after he offered a cheeky riposte to Mr O'Leary's comments that 
airlines could save "a fortune" if flight attendants replaced co-pilots on aircraft now so sophisticated that "the 
computer does most of the flying".
In a letter to the Financial Times , Capt Fischer suggested his own idea to shave costs: replacing Mr O'Leary with a 
"probationary cabin crew member currently earning about EUR13,200 net a year".
Stephen McNamara, Ryanair's head of communications, said the airline could not comment on individual 
employees or their contracts for confidentiality reasons.
But he said fewer than 10 of the almost 30 pilots at Marseilles had not said where they would like to be transferred, 
"and so these have been offered transfers to other bases in Spain, Italy, the UK and Lithuania according to where 
we have pilot vacancies".
He added: "All of our Marseilles pilots have been offered positions at other Ryanair bases, and the vast majority 
have already accepted these offers. Should some pilots choose not to, and resign, then much as we would regret 
such a decision, we would respect it and wish them every success with their future careers."

Ryanair has expressed an interest in using a closure-threatened RAF airport in Scotland as a new hub.
The RAF Leuchars base in Fife is being tipped to close, with UK Ministry of Defence officials believed to be 
considering various "commercial" options.
Ryanair has refused to confirm if it has entered into any negotiations about Leuchars, but he said a fourth Scottish 
hub for it was "absolutely" a possibility.
Ryanair's head of communications, Stephen McNamara, said a Fife airport could easily operate alongside 
Edinburgh as a cheaper alternative, supporting less popular routes. He added that the closure of the air base could 
have a "silver lining" and represent a "new beginning" for the local economy, with regular American visitors to the 
area's golf resorts. "Edinburgh is one of our most successful airports, but we have three airports in London and 
three airports in Barcelona," said McNamara. "This would offer very different tourism options for people."

EasyJet Reports Passenger, Load Factor Growth In November - Update
EasyJet Reports Passenger, Load Factor Growth In November - Update

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet plc (EZJ.L) reported Monday a 10.2% rise in number of passengers and a 90 
basis point increase in load factor - a capacity utilization measure of airlines - for the month of November.
For November, passengers, which is measured by the number of earned seats flown, grew to 3.69 million from 3.35 
million last year. Load factor, representing the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats 
available, improved 0.9 percentage points to 85.7% from 84.8% in the same month last year.
In the preceding month of October, the budget airline's passengers were 4.58 million passengers, and load factor 
was 88.2%.
For the rolling 12-month period ending November 30, passenger count increased 8% to 49.46 million from 45.79 
million, and load factor went up 1.4 percentage points to 87.2% from last year's 85.8%.
easyJet's peer Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.L) last Friday reported November passengers of 5.06 million, 
2% higher than 4.96 million in the prior year. Load factor was 80%, flat with the same period last year.
On the same day, Europe's third largest airline British Airways Plc (BAY.L, BAIRY.PK) reported that its total traffic 
for the month of November grew 3.5% to 8.630 billion on a 5.1% increase in capacity from a year ago, reflecting 
strength in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the airline's total passenger load factor was 74.7%, down 1.2 
percentage points from the prior year. The company also said that its December traffic will be affected by the 
current adverse weather in the UK and other parts of Europe.
Last month, easyJet reported a 7.9% rise in number of passengers for the year 2010 to 48.8 million, and load factor 
grew 1.5 percentage points to 87%. Revenue per seat increased 5.1% to GBP 53.07, mainly due to a strong 
second half performance.
Capacity, measured in Available Seat Kilometres, increased 8.2%, and traffic, measured in Revenue Passenger 
Kilometres, increased 11%.
In the year 2010, the company reported an increase in profit, driven by improved consumer demand and margins. 
Profit before tax more than doubled to GBP 154 million, and underlying profit before tax surged to GBP 188.3 
million, primarily driven by a unit fuel cost reduction, which drove up the margins. Total revenue grew 11.5% to GBP 
2.97 billion
EasyJet Reports Passenger, Load Factor Growth In November - Update
While announcing the annual results last month, Carolyn McCall, chief executive said, "easyJet's solid financial 
performance in a tough trading environment demonstrates that the business model is strong. easyJet is strongly 
positioned to take advantage of the continuing profitable growth opportunities in European short-haul."
EZJ.L is currently trading at 431.30 pence, up 3.70 pence or 0.87%.

When the unthinkable happens, it's not a bad time to think about doing what was previously undoable.
The once-unthinkable prospect of an EU/IMF bailout for the state is now a fact. Decades of what passed in Ireland 
for conventional wisdom has been turned on its head. The state has now openly acknowledged that it cannot 
operate without formal external support.
Rather than get upset with the measures imposed on Ireland by its external rescuers, however, it may be more 
productive to consider the bailout as a once-off opportunity to reform whatever needs to be reformed. And there is 
much that needs to be reformed.
The discipline that will be imposed by the EU and IMF will be painful, but there will, at least, be a certain logic to the 
decisions made by their officials. Cluttered thinking, which bedevilled so many of the policies of Irish politicians over 
decades, will be far less likely to cloud the management of the public finances.
The consequences of looking for an easy way out will surround us for years to come.
The state retains a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, not because it was a shrewd financial decision, but because it 
would have been too much trouble to take on opposition to an outright privatisation.
Dublin's two tram lines were never linked because it was seen as too much trouble to take on the controversy of 
shutting busy shopping streets.
A much-trumpeted interconnector of separate transport networks looks as far away as ever.
One unprecedented economic boom later, it is still not possible to undertake a journey involving Dublin's buses, 
trams and rail using a single ticket.
Comment: Ireland 's crisis harbours an opportunity for change
Dublin Airport's second terminal arrived too late for the boom years, thanks to political handwringing over the merits 
of public or private operation and ownership, leaving us with a brand new building that became available only when 
airport traffic had begun to slide.
Where was the logic behind these decisions? At best, logic came second to political concerns.
The full extent to which major public policy decisions fell victim to cluttered thinking will never be fully known.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary was one of the best-known business leaders to regularly bemoan such 
cluttered thinking. Many others vented their frustrations behind closed doors.
For the EU and IMF, however, decision-making will be a far simpler process than the one favoured by Ireland's 
political classes. If books need to be balanced, they will be. If costs need to be cut, they will be. If inefficiencies 
need to be eliminated, they will be.
It will not take long to zero in on the many sacred cows whose time is up. A revolution without reform is a wasted 
opportunity.
The four-year plan will be painful for everyone. But at the very least, it will be a rare opportunity to definitively fix 
what is broken.
That task, which was beyond our politicians, now falls to men and women like the IMF's Ajai Chopra. The nuances 
of public opinion and vested interests will mean little to them.

Spain declares 'state of alarm' over air chaos

Body
Spain declared an unprecedented "state of alarm" Saturday to try to end an air traffic controllers strike that has 
largely closed the country's air space and stranded hundreds of thousands of travelers, threatening jail terms under 
military law for controllers who refuse to go back to work.
Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said most Spanish airports were still not operating and apologized 
to irate travelers who spent Friday night sleeping at airports on what was supposed to be the start of a long holiday 
weekend.
He accused the air traffic controllers of trying to blackmail the country and warned that even if they go back to work 
soon it will take some time for Spanish airports to return to normal.
There was no immediate reaction from the air traffic controllers' union and calls there went unanswered.
The case is reminiscent of a wildcat air traffic controllers strike in 1981 in the United States, although the Spanish 
government has stopped short of simply firing controllers and breaking their union as then U.S. president at the 
time, Ronald Reagan, did.
This is usually one of the busiest travel weekends of the year in Spain because Monday and Wednesday of next 
week are holidays, and many people plan to take Tuesday off as well.
The air traffic controllers launched their wildcat strike Friday evening in the culmination of a long-running dispute 
with the government over working conditions, work schedules and benefits.
The final straw seems to have been a decree approved by the Cabinet Friday under which controllers who miss 
work shifts because of illness must make up lost hours and can be subject to medical checkups immediately if they 
call in sick.
The government reacted to the strike by placing Spain's air traffic control centers and towers under military control.
Spain declares 'state of alarm' over air chaos
TV footage on Spanish television showed seas of stranded travelers wandering around Spanish airports Saturday. 
The flagship carrier Iberia canceled all its flights in Spain until early Sunday morning. Air France and Irish airline 
Ryanair also canceled all flights to and from Spain.
At Madrid's Barajas airport, Yair Orgler, 71, from Tel Aviv, told APTN, "It is very bad, tourists from all over the world 
are affected. The situation is really serious. I hope it will be solved soon because we don't know what to do."
Carmen de Unceta, a 63-year-old Madrid native, said, "We don't know where the queue ends or begins. This is a 
tremendous mess. We are going with Iberia but I don't think we are going to leave today. It doesn't look like it is 
going to be solved."
Speaking after an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday morning, Perez Rubalcaba said of the "state of alarm": 
"The immediate effect is that controllers have become mobilized. This means that if they do not go to work, they 
would incur a crime of disobedience according to the military penal code."
He said the action would last 15 days but could be extended if Parliament approves.
The "state of alarm" clause included in Spain's 1978 constitution, passed three years after the death of longtime 
dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, had never previously been invoked. It was designed to help governments deal with 
catastrophes such as earthquakes or floods or, as in this case, the collapse of an essential public service like 
access to air travel.
Perez Rubalcaba said that in Spain as in other countries, air traffic controllers are a highly paid specialized group 
because of their unique skills but in this case Spanish controllers are using their status to defend what he called 
"intolerable privileges."
"They are blackmailing all of our citizens," he said.
Spanish air traffic controllers get triple time pay for overtime hours, for instance, and made much of their salary from 
this, earning an average yearly salary of (EURO)350,000 ($463,600).
But in February the government slashed their allowed overtime hours drastically, infuriating the controllers who saw 
their pay nearly cut in half, although that is still roughly three times what Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero makes. The average yearly salary in Spain is about (EURO)20,000.

(RTTNews) - Spain declared a "state of alarm" on Saturday as wildcat strike by air traffic controllers closed air traffic 
leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded, according to media reports.
The strike left eight airports including Madrid closed across the country.
"We won't accept this blackmail," said Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Spain's deputy prime minister, in a televised press 
conference at noon on Saturday that followed a crisis cabinet meeting. "Almost all our airports are paralyzed and so 
we are declaring a state of alarm in line with what has been established in our constitution."
The state-controlled airport management company, Aena, said on Saturday that it does not expect the airspace to 
re-open until Sunday.
Airlines including Iberia and Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) have canceled all Spanish flights until Sunday 
morning.
Spain's military took over the country's air control towers in order to get flights moving during a holiday long 
weekend in Spain.
The strike by air traffic controllers started hours after the government approved measures to partially privatise 
Spain's airports and hand over management of Madrid and Barcelona airports to the private sector.
The government has approved plans to privatize as much as 49% of Aena, a move opposed by labor unions.
The government also on Friday approved new rules dictating the working hours air traffic controllers, as well as a 
law allowing the army to take over air space in times of alarm.

Ryanair today said it is to expand its operations at Knock and Cork Airports with five new routes.
Starting in February 2011, Ryanair will operate weekly flights from Ireland West Airport Knock to the popular sun 
holiday destinations of Gran Canaria and Tenerife with flights to Lanzarote starting in April 2011.
All three services will operate on a year round basis.
The new routes bring to six the number of scheduled European services from Ireland West Airport Knock following 
the introduction of services to Alicante, Faro-Algarve and Reus-Barcelona which commenced last March and May 
respectively. It is also opening two Canary Islands routes from Cork. The addition of these new services will 
compliment Ryanair's existing network of routes at Ireland West Knock which includes daily scheduled services to 
Liverpool, London Luton and London Stansted airports in addition to the four-times-a-week services to East 
Midlands and the three times a week services to Bristol and Leeds Bradford. It is expected that this latest expansion 
by Ryanair at Ireland West Knock will generate an estimated 35,000 additional annual passengers at the Airport, 
Ryanair said. Welcoming today's announcement, Joe Gilmore, Managing Director, Ireland West Airport Knock said: 
"We are delighted to welcome this major expansion by Ryanair from Ireland West Knock which represents a hugely 
significant milestone in the Airport's development as we expand our schedule services to now include the hugely 
popular Canary Islands. Ryanairs continued growth from Ireland West Knock is further great news for passengers 
and we are sure the new, year round, services to Lanzarote, Tenerife and Gran Canaria will prove hugely popular 
with holidaymakers in the West, North West and Midlands regions of Ireland and beyond who can soak up some 
winter and summer sun at great low prices. Despite the current economic uncertainty, Ireland West Knock 
continues to attract new destinations and provide more choice and value for money for the people in the region and 
this latest expansion from Ryanair underlines the airline's continued confidence in our airport."

Body
According to Ryanair today, Ireland's E10 air travel tax may be ruled as illegal by the EU.
Back in March 2010 the EU Commission initiated infringement proceedings against the Irish tax.
These infringement proceedings focus on the fact that the lower E2 tax, for flights within 300 km of Dublin (whereas 
a E10 tax is applied to EU flights of over 300km) is contrary to EU law, which requires that the same tax rate should 
be applied to all intra-EU journeys regardless of length, Ryanair said.
These infringement proceedings make clear that the Irish Govt must either scrap this unlawful E10 tourist tax or 
impose the same E2 rate on all intra-EU flights. Ryanair believes that these infringement proceedings will now force 
the Govt to scrap this damaging tourist tax (which has failed miserably to generate its forecasted revenues). 
"Ryanair made a formal complaint about this illegal E10 tourist tax to the EU Commission in July 2008. These 
Freedom of Information records clearly show that the Commission agrees with Ryanair's complaint that this E10 tax 
has been illegally applied here in Ireland. The Irish Govt must therefore scrap this damaging E10 tax or reduce it to 
E2 in the December budget. Ryanair expects that the Govt will scrap its failed and damaging E10 tourist tax," 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said.

Snow disruption at British airports, strike threats at British Airways, eurozone contagion spreading across markets 
and economies, and the death of Airplane! star Leslie Nielsen. Bar a re-eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, surely there 
could not be a less auspicious moment to announce the flotation of regional airline Flybe .
Naturally, Flybe disputes this. This is the end of the runway down which it started to trundle in 2006. The acquisition 
of BA Connect, announced at the end of that year, gave the group scale in a competitive short-haul market, but also 
a large network to digest. The subsequent credit crunch and financial crisis slowed most companies' listing plans. 
Flybe obviously believes it has now reached take-off speed.
Just don't understate the headwinds. Domestic airline travel is not the UK government's favourite mode of transport. 
Flybe, which flies smaller aircraft than Ryanair or EasyJet, can't squeeze per-seat costs as its larger competitors 
can. The overhang of shares owned by BA itself and the late Jack Walker's family trust, despite their promises to 
stay on board, could eventually weigh on the 25 per cent or so of the listed group that would float freely.
Aviation veteran Jim French, Flybe's chairman and chief executive, won't be deterred. The purchase of new aircraft 
and the forging of fresh European alliances and acquisitions would still be possible without the share sale. But more 
fuel makes that destination easier to reach. There really never is a perfect moment to float an airline, so why miss a 
slot? And don't call me Shirley.

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Wednesday announced three new bases on 
the Canary Islands in summer 2011. Ryanair will base six aircraft across Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Tenerife 
from February 2011 while also increasing Fuerteventura routes and frequencies.
The company said it will operate 112 routes to and from the Canary Islands, including 35 new routes, which will 
deliver 4.5 million passengers p.a., sustaining over 4,500 local jobs including 350 Ryanair pilots, cabin crew and 
engineers.
Ryanair carried just 300 thousand passengers to the Canary Islands in 2009. However, the company noted that the 
Islands' Government and the Spanish Parliament incentivised air traffic growth by reducing airport charges for 2010 
and 2011, and recently announcing a 2013-2015 Regional Marketing Fund to support continued air traffic growth.

Will Terry Smith's fund be a knock-out?
Will Terry Smith's fund be a knock-out?
Citywire

Body
It is no surprise that Terry Smith (pictured) describes himself as a 'come-forward' boxer.
Smith, one of the City's more pugnacious characters, is a keen pugilist who takes no prisoners in or out of the ring 
and says the best way to protect yourself is by stepping into your opponent rather than keeping him at arm's length.
A seriously wealthy man, Smith could have easily called time on his City career after stepping down as Collins 
Stewart's chairman. Instead, he chose to pit himself in a relatively new arena and put his reputation on the line.
The mere suggestion that Smith, a qualified helicopter pilot, could have called it a day makes his hair stand on end. 
'Why should I retire? I can do this job until I die. I like doing things and don't ever want to retire.'
Smith certainly was not shy in coming forward last month when he launched a high-conviction fund at his new 
investment boutique, Fundsmith.
As far as investment strategies go, the Fundsmith Equity fund could not be simpler. It will invest in a portfolio of just 
20 stocks held for the long term with low turnover, which will help keep its total expense ratio at about 1%, some 
0.8% lower than the conventional equity fund.
This has led to Smith being dubbed by rivals (somewhat disparagingly) as the 'Michael O'Leary [Ryanair chief 
executive] of the funds industry'. Far from bothering him, Smith is happy with the comparison. '[O'Leary] 
substantially lowered the cost of air travel while still providing a good basic service.'
At the fund's inception he claimed it was designed for a 'broken industry'. While he chose to slate fund charges at 
launch, he thinks there has been too much focus on his fund's fee structure and not enough on the simplicity of the 
investment process.
'According to the FSA, the average mutual fund turns over 80% of its portfolio every year, the cost of which is not 
included in the total expense ratio. Does the average fund manager really have that many good ideas a year? If he 
does, he's a better man than me. I don't think any human being has that many good investment ideas,' he says.
Discretion on disclosure Smith has no intention of sharing his ideas with the public. In fact, there's no guarantee 
investors in the fund will even be told what he is investing in. 'If we reveal the portfolio, people will be preoccupied 
and will ask do I really want that stock in my portfolio? We have not yet decided what information we will disclose.'
Will Terry Smith's fund be a knock-out?
He is, however, prepared to reveal the type of company he will invest in. 'There won't be any obscure holdings in 
the fund, you will have heard of the vast majority of the companies.
They are the type of firms which provide a high return on cash and compound your wealth. They are firms that 
focus on small ticket non-durables, producing the kind of products consumers need. The average company in our 
portfolio has been around since 1883. They have endured two world wars and the Great Depression. They are 
survivors.'
One stock down One thing he had not bargained for was a takeover over approach for one of his holdings just 18 
days after he launched the portfolio. But this is exactly what happened when Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts said it was 
in talks to buy Del Monte.
It emerged that Del Monte was one of his stock when Smith found it impossible to contain himself and used his blog 
as an outlet for his frustration.
'On one level this is good news. The price of our Del Monte stock has risen and will rise further if or when the 
takeover is completed. This will boost short term performance of the fund. But on the other hand it will mean that 
Fundsmith will lose a stock which it wanted to own.
'I purchased Del Monte on a free cash flow yield of about 10%. This is an unusually high yield free cash flow yield 
for a good company. I think I was able to buy Del Monte at this attractive free cash flow yield because not many 
people understood what it does.'
Track record Investing with Smith will be putting blind faith in someone who has proven himself on several counts 
but has no demonstrative track record in retail fund management. However, he uses his influence on the Tullett 
Prebon pension fund as evidence that he knows what he's doing.
Since he was appointed investment adviser on the fund in 2003, it has doubled the return of the benchmark on an 
annualised basis. He attributes this success to his appointment of a discretionary manager, the name
of which he refuses to disclose, which managed the pension in a similar vein to Fundsmith Equity fund.
Whether the retail market takes to Smith remains to be seen but he is so confident of success he does not feel he 
needs to hunt down prospective investors, whom he expects to make the right choice when armed with the 29-page 
manual he has penned on the fund. 'Our ideal investor is not someone who simply gives us a lot of money but 
someone who completely understands what we're doing and why we're doing it.'
Smith has backed his talk by pouring £25 million of his wealth into the fund, which now has about £30 million in 
assets under management. There is no capacity constraint, so investors have time to consider whether he is worth 
backing and investment could not be more straightforward. 'You can be invested in my fund within three clicks on 
our website. Tell me another fund management group out there that offers such an accessible service.'

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, Dublin airport's spin doctor ( Letters , November 24) cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, or in the case 
of Dublin airport, a big white elephant's ear!
Lest your readers be misled about Dublin airport's new EUR1.2bn Taj Mahal terminal (a fitting welcome lounge for 
the International Monetary Fund!) may I correct Paul O'Kane's claims as follows:
1) Terminal 2 is 12 months late and five times over budget. Dublin airport originally promised that this terminal 
would be operational in "late 2009" and would cost "EUR170m-EUR200m". In fact it opened in late 2010 and it cost 
EUR1.2bn, a five-fold overrun.
2) This new white elephant isn't necessary. The existing terminal at Dublin can handle up to 30m passengers a 
year, but traffic has collapsed from 24.5m in 2008, to 18m passengers in 2010. This is directly due to Dublin 
airport's ludicrous cost increases including a 40 per cent hike in fees in 2010, when inflation in Ireland is 0 per cent.
3) Ryanair's description of T2 as a bankrupt property development is entirely appropriate given that its owner, the 
Dublin Airport Authority, last year recorded a loss of EUR14m, yet has borrowed some EUR1.2bn to develop T2, 
which Dublin airport doesn't need, and its airlines won't use. Dublin airport is incapable of generating sufficient 
income to repay these extraordinary debts.
4) Finally, both the DAA and Terminal 2 are "state funded". This year the minister for transport ordered the Irish 
aviation regulator to approve a 40 per cent increase in DAA fees, solely to fund T2 and to prioritise the "financial 
viability" of the DAA over all other considerations such as tourism or passenger welfare.
Michael O'Leary,
Chief Executive, Ryanair,
Dublin Airport, Co Dublin, Ireland

Irish banks rose in early share dealings this morning as investors sought to absorb the massive changes they will

AIB has edged 2c higher to 36, while Bank of Ireland is up 5c to 31 and Irish Life and Permanent has gained 18c to

Of the 85bn euro in the rescue plan, 35bn euro is for the banks. However, they will also have to raise their capital 
ratios sharply.
Irish Life and Permanent said this morning that it plans to raise the money on the market, with Bank of Ireland also 
intending to try to do the same. The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 43.21 points ahead a short time ago at

More ripples than shockwaves on markets
More ripples than shockwaves on markets
Sunday Business Post

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 923 words

The details of a four-year plan to push e 15 billion in cuts through the Irish economy and confirmation that a 
financial bailout was being arranged were just two of the news stories which Irish investors had to digest this week.
Rumours about the future of the banks and possible arrangements with their bondholders have also been swirling 
around in recent days.
But developments which would have caused shockwaves in the exchange even a few weeks ago are now receiving 
a muted reaction.
This is partly because uncertainty about the conclusion of the banking crisis remained last week, although investors 
should be clearer on this by the opening bell tomorrow.
The other reason the Irish stock exchange (Iseq) didn't react dramatically to the news was that the performance of 
the economy has become increasingly irrelevant for Irish stocks.
The already depressed Irish stock exchange closed down over 5 per cent in the week. For most shares, prices are 
now based on the value and prospects any international businesses they operate, with a very poor outlook for 
Ireland priced in already.
The main drag last week was a further fall for the Irish banks, which are now priced for nationalisation. They cannot 
fall much more.
The revenue for the Iseq's leading shares is predominantly dependent on business outside Ireland. Building giant 
CRH accounts for 27 per cent of the Iseq, Ryanair for 15 per cent, Kerry for 10 per cent, and food group Aryzta 7 
per cent.
''You wouldn't sell them on the back of further bad news from Ireland," said one broker.
More ripples than shockwaves on markets
Most Irish shares have suffered from negativity stemming from their association with Ireland at the moment, but 
brokers and the companies themselves have been trying to highlight their limited reliance on this economy.
Among the smaller cap companies, there are some stocks which cannot avoid being linked to Ireland's woes. Ross 
McEvoy, wealth management analyst with Merrion, said: ''You could argue that the austerity measures taking  6 
billion out of the economy next year will eat into consumer discretionary spending and that this would impact on 
some stocks''.
Bookmaker Paddy Power and cider group C&C are among the companies which will suffer from reduced Irish 
spending, but McEvoy said that companies and other stocks with heavy exposure to locals markets had been 
guiding expectations for the Irish economy lower in any case.
''C&C are saying that consumer sentiment in Ireland is very weak and they don't expect to see any recovery soon. 
Expectations for the Irish side is so low, cutting outlook by, say, 10 per cent, doesn't really matter," said McEvoy.
He said insurance company FBD was one of the stocks most obviously affected by the reduced consumer 
confidence. ''They are going to see people taking out less home insurance and people are going to be very price 
sensitive when it comes to insuring their cars.
In this type of environment, the lowest cost operator tends to win. However, in saying that, they recently upped their 
guidance for the year - due to lower claims more than anything else," said McEvoy.
Newspaper group Independent News and Media saw its share price fall last week, with investors likely to have been 
concerned about the strength of the Irish ad market. The stock closed down at 49 cent on Friday, compared with 55 
cent a week earlier.
Some commentators were surprised by the extent of the fall, given the fact that the company has seen its share 
price strengthen on the back of its businesses in South Africa and Australia, rather than hopes of recovery in 
Ireland.
Ian Hunter of Goodbody Stockbrokers said that the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 was of direct relevance to 
United Drug. T he Irish government is proposing to achieve savings of  746 million from the Department of Health's 
budget.
Applying the proposed cuts directly to the Irish drug distribution sector -which is a worst case scenario - could feed 
through to a 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent dip in United Drug's earnings for 2011. But Hunter said there could also be 
some positives for the company, through its distribution of generic drugs.
Aer Lingus could also see some pressure on Irish passenger numbers in the wake of the tax increases, although 
much of this would have already been priced in.
Goodbody economist Dermot O'Leary said: ''For me, the four-year plan should have been the highlight this week, 
but it has been very much overshadowed by the continued leaks and speculation about what's going to happen to 
the banks''.
''The market relevance of the four-year plan two weeks ago would have been significantly greater than it actually 
turned out to be because we have the involvement now of the IMF and the EU."
But he agreed that the Irish economy had been priced out of current share prices. ''The whole issue of the Irish 
economy being an irrelevance for a lot of the corporates on the Iseq does come into it.
''There might be some sentiment issues, but I think that investors would look at the exposure of the individual 
companies and see that their exposure to the Irish economy overall is very small, especially for CRH, the largest 
stock on the market by far."
The same could be said for the small Irish shares which are more dependent on the local economy.
More ripples than shockwaves on markets
''They have pretty much accepted that the Irish environment is going to be weak and I don't think the events of the 
past week changed that view to any significant degree," said O'Leary.
''Everyone knew that the four-year plan was coming down the tracks, and that there is a lot of pain to come, and 
priced that into expectations."

Highlight: From CEOs to working mothers, the quest to de-stress is the great modern goal, and a global spa and 
'wellness' industry now supports our yearning for 'me time'. But is it really possible to be pampered into serenity? 
Charlotte Raven lay back and found out
Body
I nearly didn't make it to the Mayr Clinic. The sight of Heather Mills at the Ryanair check-in for my flight to 
Klagenfurt in Austria nearly made me turn tail. Though horrified, I wasn't at all surprised. Of course she would be 
there. A rigorous detox spa would suit someone with Heather's propensity for one-upmanship.
Her uber-radiance caused my ambivalence about the trip to harden into resistance. I feared returning with the 
complacent glow of the global spa junkie. In a week's time, I'd be the one clutching the diet book with the aspect of 
someone who travels -without experiencing.
The other Mayr guests were as relieved as I was when Heather and her lackies jumped into a taxi. Where could 
they be going? Every one of us in the transfer bus to the Mayr had a theory. Perhaps she was heading to the "other 
place" - a more glamorous Mayr clinic a few miles down Lake Worthersee. Or having a party in one of the grand 
mansions around the Lake.
Their gossipy candour took me aback. These high-born English ladies spoke freely and loudly at just the pitch I 
would if people weren't forever -telling me to "Shhh!". I hadn't expected people en route to a rest cure to be this 
animated.
The talk then moved to the physical and -emotional benefits of the "Mayr and More" -experience. I was the only 
first-timer. Lady B asked what I was expecting from my week at the clinic. I told her I was expecting enlightenment, 
but not fun. I'd formed the impression that the "house" was cloaked in silence at all times. The ladies laughed 
heartily at this.
I was told not to expect "slick". Unusually for a destination spa, the Mayr Clinic hasn't been "styled". Its English 
clients prefer it that way. Their selection of this homely option over "the other place" marked them out as persons of 
discrimination. "This is where the people of talent go," I was told, flatteringly.
The Ultimate Stress Test Stories
The view from the window was reassuringly orderly. Neat Heidi houses abutted with logs cut to a uniform size. I 
fancied the fish in Lake Worthersee might be similarly neat and uniform.
Jane C, a writer, asked what had motivated me to come, given that I wasn't apparently in need of losing weight. I 
explained that I was on a quest to de-stress.
"I'm not sure I understand what that word 'stressed' means," Jane said. "It's a catch-all term that's less useful than 
the words it replaced, the ones describing specific emotions. When people say they are stressed, I think they mean 
they are -frustrated, angry or even... sad."
That long pause suggested there was something in Jane's recent past for which the word "stressful" was 
inadequate.
Jane's compassionate scepticism reminded me of the response my GP has when I self-diagnose. I wanted to 
assure her that my condition was neither a cultural construct nor a pseudo-medical fad. I hadn't got stress off the 
internet! While accepting that it might be hard to define precisely, stress feels as real to me as love.
My husband Tom works away a lot. His most recent month-long trip coincided with a series of domestic crises. I 
was, as usual, at least partly to blame for the dented car and broken dishwasher. I lay awake all night for three 
nights, stressing about how we're going to pay the credit card bill for the dishwasher on top of the one for our new 
mattress and bed, which together came to £3,000.
I felt guilty about the Tempur -mattress, which hadn't aided restful sleep. My insomnia was, if anything, worse. I'd lie 
there sweating in the Tempur's slightly -sinister microclimate, feeling like an idiot for spending all our holiday money 
on a de-stressing sleep "solution".
I'm embarrassed to admit that I was gulled by the manufacturer's claim that an hour's sleep on a Tempur equated to 
three in a normal bed. Yet the decision to ditch our perfectly good coil-sprung bed was understandable, if not 
excusable. We often hear that stressed people are poor decision-makers. The logical "brainy" part of the brain 
closes down, apparently. When this happens, we can only focus on survival goals, rather than long-term ones.
This describes my mindset in the bed store Warren Evans when I said, "I'll have that one." The survival goal - 
getting a night's sleep - had eclipsed the -long-term goal of avoiding debt. I tried to explain to Tom that this luxury 
was a necessity. His perfectly functioning upper neocortex told him that it wasn't, logically. He told me there was no 
such thing as a "relaxing" bit of plastic.
I placed the order anyway. My defiance felt -justified. I was acting defensively, believing stress was threatening my 
existence. Allison Pearson and other motherhood writers have portrayed it as maternal enemy number one, 
overtaking boredom and bad sex. Impressed by this analysis, I joined them in manically hyping stress up. Our 
campaign has been successful. There is now general agreement that the middle-class mother's life is more 
challenging than that of a global CEO.
For my generation of stressed-out working mothers, de-stressing has become a survival goal. Our need for 
lavender pillow sprays, relaxation CDs and upscale loungewear is urgent and -immediate. Along with stressed chief 
executives, we are the -biggest consumers of de-stressing -products and services.
So we've drunk our de-stressing vitamin water and applied de-stressing eye cream with no visible effect. The next 
thing on the agenda is booking a spa "escape". We're spoilt for choice as there are estimated to be 50,000 spas 
worldwide. The -success of this multi-billion-dollar global industry is a tribute to the spa marketers' skill at 
convincing us that de-stressing can only take place in a -building designated for the purpose. According to them, 
this pseudo-religious rite can be performed in -a converted hay barn or a stilted cabana in the middle of the Indian 
Ocean, but not a library or your front room.
If I'd been less stressed, I might have realised that there's no such thing as a "de-stressing" bit of architecture. 
When Tom returned from his trip, I foolishly tried to sell him the idea of my spa "escape" in terms borrowed from the 
The Ultimate Stress Test Stories
reviews in Spa Secrets magazine. He'd barely put his suitcase down before I'd announced that I was desperate for 
some "me time".
When modern women dream about escaping our banal existences we fantasise, equally banally, about draping our 
carcasses in tepidaria where Grazia is the only reading material allowed. For us, relaxation means the 
decommissioning of body and mind. I wonder if the desire to de-stress is a death drive, and if so what that says 
about us. While our forebears yearned for excitement and expanded horizons, we long to be prone on tomb-like -
treatment tables.
I told Tom that a series of spa breaks was urgently needed: it would be the ideal way for me to -de-stress. Nothing 
else had worked, had it? I'd never been to a spa, as I'd never fancied being "pampered". I did now, though. For the 
first time, the word -resonated. I'd always thought it the -preserve of silly women, yet now, the prospect of being 
infantilised seemed alluring rather than ridiculous. I was tired of looking after myself and happy to devolve 
responsibility for the task to trained professionals. With this in mind, I booked three spa "experiences" of different 
sorts.
I wasn't yet sure of my spa "type". Was I high or low church, in spa terms? I wanted to try -everything, knowing this 
would be expensive. A sliver of "me time" would cost more than our family holiday.
I told myself not to feel guilty. There was ample cultural evidence supporting my belief that "me time" is a necessity, 
not a luxury. The Radox "Selfish Hour" advertising campaign suggests that everyone around us benefits from our 
"selfish" hour: "When you feel happy it makes everyone around you feel happy too."
Although they might not see it, my selfish three weeks would benefit the whole family.
Breakfast at the Mayr was like Christmas in Albert Square. Everyone in the dining room looked somewhat the 
worse for wear. It's a cruel irony that detoxers look hungover. I attributed their extravagant bad temper to the 
synthetic duvets, until I remembered that none of us had eaten since lunchtime the previous day.
One new arrival, Mrs Blanchard Smythe, was explaining to the waitress how she liked her bacon cooked. Madame 
seemed not to be aware that bacon was not allowed. Not toast, nor locally sourced mushrooms. She could have tea 
or yoghurt. But not tea and yoghurt.
I craned my neck to see Mrs B S burst a gasket in a cartoonish way, knowing I'd replay the scene many times in my 
head in the coming days.
On the table to my left, old-timer Lady B was philosophical about the privations, but concerned about how this detox 
would impact on her -physically. Last time, she'd had problems with her -eyesight and couldn't read. I wasn't 
surprised to discover that massively reducing one's food intake while downing Epsom Salts might impact adversely 
on one's health.
To a burned-out businessman, of which there were several at the Mayr, the appeal of a detox is more visceral than 
scientific. The disquiet he feels contemplating his dirty body is the same as I feel contemplating my dirty house. He 
can't settle, much less work, when he thinks it's in need of a spring clean. When the job is completed, he feels 
relieved rather than relaxed.
I'd never seen myself as internally dirty and couldn't imagine how I would cope if this -perception shifted. I was 
concerned about what else would be revealed during my initial -consultation with Dr Frank Bolvari, medical- -
director and general manager of this celebrated wellness clinic.
In the accounts of its supporters, wellness is about potential. Wellness diagnostics assess how far the client's state 
of health deviates from his optimal condition. Clients are then assisted towards the highest state of wellbeing of 
which they are capable. They are encouraged to devise their own -stratagem in pursuit of this goal. Since this -
commonly involves the renunciation of past -pleasures, the quest for wellness is often cast as a moral crusade.
Like all wellness clinics, the Mayr proposes to find out what's wrong with you long before you've realised it yourself.
The Ultimate Stress Test Stories
I didn't know what the diagnosis would be, but did know where, anatomically. From my reading, I knew that the 
original Dr Mayr - back in the 1920s - was obsessed with digestion, believing it to be the root of many 
unacknowledged ills.
The book I was given when I checked in - Health Through Inner Body Cleansing by Mayr disciple Dr Erich Rauch - 
contained diagrams of eight different belly shapes, only one of which was deemed "normal". The other seven are 
manifestations of undiagnosed disorders.
A laminated card on my table emphasised the importance of eating in a relaxed environment, free from distractions. 
But the combination of my obsessive reading and rereading of the instruction card and the awful mental images 
conjured by Dr Rauch's diagrams were far more distracting than the cacophony of my usual family breakfast.
To distract myself from these distractions, I attended a lakeside exercise session called "Active in the Morning" with 
Jane. In the changing room, I scanned my body for hints of abnormality. There was nothing amiss except my 
peeling nails and I could explain them.
My first spa experience, at Urban Retreat in Manchester, had tested the impact of beautification on my stress 
levels, with surprising results. In -defiance of my feminist principles, I'd had my nails "done". I'd expected my acrylic 
nail extensions to look chipped and crappy after a couple of days, -generating more stress.
Three-and-a-half weeks later, they were pristine, but I had cracked. They seemed to be mocking me, drawing 
attention to my deficiencies. My wardrobe wasn't good enough for them, nor my friends. I stressed in the way you 
do when you're going out with someone better-looking than you. Dumping them was no easy matter, sadly. The 
woman at the John Lewis nail bar said she'd never known acrylics to be so tenacious. They clung on like limpets in 
a chemical rockpool.
The lakeside exercise session did me good. I bounded into Bolvari's office. I'd never thought much about my 
digestion, but felt confident it would pass muster. My flat stomach was proof, surely, that I wasn't lying when I said I 
ate healthily.
I had underestimated the emotional force of Bolvari's concern. His expression when he tapped my stomach caused 
me to blush. He explained that I was deluded about my level of wellness. Compared with what it ideally should be, 
my flat stomach was bloated. He listened to it through a stethoscope, then asked me to listen. "What's it meant to 
sound like?" I asked, with my stress levels rising. Not that, clearly. Tests were ordered.
I was crestfallen. Bolvari's attraction level was perfectly calibrated for inspiring confidence. Any more attractive and 
I'd have disbelieved the -diagnosis. Any less, and I'd have confidently -challenged the Mayr's elitist model of 
"wellness". I was shocked at being labelled a digestive -deviant. Bolvari's insistence that my malaise was common 
and easily remedied was little comfort to someone with body-fascistic tendencies. Unnerved by this revelation of 
internal imperfection, I decided I'd do whatever he deemed necessary to bring me back into line with this newly 
calibrated "ideal". A week on a restricted diet should do it, he said.
The diet he suggested seemed more do-able than the tea fast proposed for those with weight problems. Egg and 
bread for breakfast, a boiled potato and soup for lunch, another bowl of soup for tea - "You won't starve on this."
On the way out, I risked a little flirtatious -badinage with Bolvari's statuesque assistant, Barbara. The reception area 
where she was stationed was rickety and unreal, like the set on Doctors. The afternoon-TV aesthetic made us all 
feel that flirting with Barbara was artistically justified - that and the fact that she is glamorous but not "slick".
Two days later, I nearly killed the waitress who refused my request for an extra piece of bread. I'd been awake all 
night, wrestling with hunger pangs. I rushed to Bolvari, demanding more. He assented and put me on the 
"Regeneration 3 diet", which meant two courses at lunch and a piece of bread with my evening soup.
My promotion caused a great stir in the dining room. Like the prisoner who'd won privileges by devious means, I 
was envied and despised in equal measure. At first, I luxuriated in the sensation of being top dog. At lunchtime, 
The Ultimate Stress Test Stories
Lady B and the rest gathered round my plate, gazing longingly at my sliver of pike. Then it all got a bit much. I 
banned them from taking photographs, suspecting that iPhone images of my apple strudel were being turned into 
food porn.
Why didn't they all demand to be upgraded to Regeneration 3? I was sure Dr B wouldn't refuse them. They were 
suffering, weren't they? Lady B was experiencing a recurrence of the eye trouble that affected her on the last detox. 
Another lady was wracked with pain in her muscles. Starving can't be good for you, can it?
They listened to me intently, then returned to their tables. When I next looked, Lady B was gazing at the writing on 
her menu card as if it were a form of divine law. I felt frustrated, unable to grasp why my incitement to revolution 
had fallen flat.
I understand now. For some of these high- ranking ladies, surrendering their autonomy was the point. If, like Lady 
B, you could have anything you wanted, it must be rather thrilling to have something withheld for a circumscribed 
period. What looked like punishment to me was for them an exquisite and rarefied form of pampering.
For another category of patient, conceding to the body's demands would mean a loss of face. These macho 
detoxers spent hours reminiscing about the old days when there was no spelt bread, no yoghurt, no spoonful of 
honey in your herbal teas. The first few days of a tea fast were hell, they said, but after that it was euphoric, man.
Instead of euphoria, I was riven with envy during my week's stay at the Mayr. The woman sitting next to me in the 
dining room was my media doppelganger. Her wardrobe was exactly what I'd have worn if I'd been rich. The only 
person I didn't envy was the woman with emphysema who couldn't leave her room.
I didn't sleep any better than at home. You can't lie in at the Mayr. Days begin early, at 7.30. We had a packed 
schedule of treatments, tests and consultations. I was tired. But how stressed was I?
Bolvari gave one answer... PE teacher Hannes gave another. His EKG machine pronounced me in a low percentile, 
stress-wise. I was indignant, -feeling like I'd been robbed of the only thing that conferred status in this milieu. I didn't 
have a -country pile, or an invitation to Alexander Lebedev's birthday party, but I did have lowered adrenal 
functioning, according to Dr B; as low as one of the burned-out businessmen.
Bolvari was able to account for the discrepancy. I was stressed - but well-adapted to cope with it. He still thought I'd 
benefit from some of the anti-stress treatments. Sadly, I wasn't adapted to deal with the stress of these hardcore 
"therapies".
The intravenous "laser blood irradiation -therapy" was as scary as it sounds. Hooked up to this Soviet-era-like 
contraption, I decided this de-stressing service wouldn't be the one to market to the mothers back home.
On my last night, I asked Jane if I could borrow her gold and diamond knuckleduster ring. "I'll have to stop myself 
from giving it to you," she said. It looked very good with the Cavalli kaftan I'd borrowed from the woman with 
emphysema. The spoils of stress were everywhere. My media -doppelganger's gorgeous Prada Sport windcheater 
was a guilt gift from her stressed husband.
My last hours were spent noting down the names of sleeping pills. My friends' suggestions were most welcome. If I 
slept better, I figured I'd find a way of turning my stress percentile into prizes. Picturing the journalist whose entire 
oeuvre is a paean to stress, I realised I'd been wrong to even contemplate getting rid of it. If I hung on to it, I'd have 
an excuse to come back and see Dr Bolvari.
At my final examination, he pronounced me -half-cured. My stomach was flatter, but my stress levels were 
mercifully unaltered. He hoped I would come back and promised to offer me an excellent rate if I did.
Spas and their stressed subjects exist in a curious symbiosis. Who would want to de-stress when the rewards for 
not doing so include regular sojourns to an "indulgent" spa? I was glad I'd left my trip to one of these pampering 
"havens" until last. Post-Mayr, I definitely fancied going somewhere where I would be treated as an infallible 
customer rather than recalcitrant patient. You've earned it, everyone kept saying. But had I?
The Ultimate Stress Test Stories
There was no lily pond in my treatment room at Pennyhill Park in Surrey. The global trend for -hyperbolic luxury 
hadn't penetrated beyond the communal areas. Expecting uber-glamour, I was surprised to find myself in a 
somewhat desexed version of a boutique hotel room, with brownish walls and a cheap-looking double bed. It looked 
as if they'd started theming it, then thought better of it. It wasn't their fault. What do you put in a treatment room? 
What is it, after all?
According to the Pennyhill blurb, the Li'Tya "Dreaming" treatment they offer reconnects the trinity of mind, body and 
spirit and unleashes your utmost potential; your dreaming.
At certain points during my Dreaming -treatment I came close to feeling comfortable for the first time in my odyssey. 
The heated treatment table was wonderful. It had always seemed wrong that you couldn't lie on electric blankets 
when they were on. As the treatment progressed, the comfort penetrated through several layers, but not quite to my 
core. (Perhaps only drugs can do that.)
I stopped thinking, but couldn't quite stop being. That longed-for moment of "easeful death" - the ultimate spa 
indulgence - never came. The closer I came to it, the more I resented the occasional reminders of my humanity: the 
sting of the salty body rub in the cut in my little finger, the tickle in the back of my throat.
Therapist Lucy's presence was self-effacing in just the right measure. During my three hours with her, I didn't 
access some made-in-Surrey version of the Aboriginal dreamtime, but did gain some insight into what it would be 
like to be Cleopatra slathered in unguents from faraway continents.
When I went for a shower midway through the treatment, I was appalled to find no body wash. Lucy had left the 
room, and there was no panic button in the shower to summon her. I would have had a tantrum if I hadn't felt too 
silly, slathered head to toe in mud from the Australian outback.
Leaving Pennyhill Park in the dark, I was -perturbed to find no chauffeured car waiting for me on the gravel drive. 
Back home, Tom said hello and carried on with his accounts. He didn't unpack my case, or offer to draw me a rose-
petal-strewn bath. After a couple of days of making my own cups of tea, I was longing again for some more "me 
time".
My selfish three weeks hadn't made me less -selfish, but more so. For my family, it would have been better if I'd 
stayed at home and looked after them. New research suggests that altruism is the best remedy for stress. The fact 
that we spend so much of our "me time" doing the opposite suggests that we're not at all serious about de-
stressing.
Stress makes me feel important. That's why I don't want to let go of it, in spite of the fact that there's less excuse for 
it than there ever was. My moans about life are as unjustified as my moans about Pennyhill Park. My life is 
relatively easy. I'm not in sole charge of anyone. Like Allison Pearson, I have a nanny. My days contain vast 
tranches of "me time". If the trip has taught me anything, it's that stress is a luxury, not a necessity.
The treatments described in this article cost Charlotte Raven a total of about £1,800. Some names have been 
changed.

The ISEQ fell again this morning as investors fretted over talk that both junior and senior bondholders in the banks 
may be forced to share the pain of a total restructuring of debt.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 20.89 points to 2,633.79.
Talk of a burden sharing solution where both junior and senior debt holders would take a hit sent Irish bank bonds 
plummeting this morning.
AIB's E750 million of 5.625pc senior notes due 2014 plunged 4 cents on the euro to 73 cents, a 5.2pc decline, 
according to composite prices on Bloomberg. Bank of Ireland's E974 million of 4.625pc senior unsecured notes 
maturing in 2013 fell 3.6 cents on the euro, or 4.2pc, to 81 cents. The sharp fall came as the EU / IMF delegation in 
Dublin looked at how senior bondholders could be compelled to pay some of the cost of rescuing Ireland's banks. 
Meanwhile, a report in the Financial Times suggests that EU officials are considering a new round of Europe-wide 
stress tests, incorporating liquidity measures as well as capital ratios, as early as the first quarter of 2011. Latest 
reports suggest we may get an announcement over the weekend, with European leaders last night urging a speedy 
conclusion to the process. Shares in AIB were flat at E0.30, Bank of Ireland dropped 1c to E0.25 and Irish Life and 
Permanent lost 10c to E0.50. The FDA in the US has delayed the review period for cladribine for three months. 
Cladribine is being investigated as a potential treatment for MS. At the very least, the extended review period 
postpones new MS competition for Elan's Tysabri in the US for another three months. At best, it raises another 
question on cladribine's chances of approval in the US market, according to Davy. Shares in the Irish drug 
developer fell 11c to E3.94. Lufthansa is set to increase its short haul capacity by 6pc on existing routes by adding 
2 additional rows to its existing aircraft with the use of slimmer backrests. The seats, which are expected to be 
unveiled on December 15th, will also boost leg room by up to 5 centimetres. The carrier is also expected to launch 
a new service concept as part of the revamp. Shares in Ryanair fell 5c to E3.84.

The ISEQ closed another crisis-fraught week slightly ahead as investors sought out potential bargains but deep 
concerns remain over talk that both junior and senior bondholders in the banks may be forced to share the pain of a 
total restructuring of debt.
The ISEQ gained 12.09 points to 2,666.77.
Talk of a burden sharing solution where debt holders would take a hit sent Irish bank bonds plummeting on Friday.
AIB's E750 million of 5.625pc senior notes due 2014 plunged 4 cents on the euro to 73 cents, a 5.2pc decline, 
according to composite prices on Bloomberg. Bank of Ireland's E974 million of 4.625pc senior unsecured notes 
maturing in 2013 fell 3.6 cents on the euro, or 4.2pc, to 81 cents. The sharp fall came as the EU / IMF delegation in 
Dublin looked at how senior bondholders could be compelled to pay some of the cost of rescuing Ireland's banks. 
Meanwhile, a report in the Financial Times suggests that EU officials are considering a new round of Europe-wide 
stress tests, incorporating liquidity measures as well as capital ratios, as early as the first quarter of 2011. Latest 
reports suggest we may get an announcement over the weekend, with European leaders last night urging a speedy 
conclusion to the process. Shares in AIB were up 4c at E0.34, Bank of Ireland rose 1c to E0.26 and Irish Life and

Cladribine is being investigated as a potential treatment for MS. At the very least, the extended review period

Highlight: Fight over attempts to curb export credits
Ryanair and Emirates form lobbying alliance
Body
Ryanair and Emirates have taken the unusual step of joining forces with eight other airlines as a multibillion-dollar 
row over aircraft financing starts to split the world's -largest airlines into two rival camps.
The Irish budget airline and Dubai's Emirates said on Thursday they had teamed up with carriers such as Etihad of 
Abu Dhabi, Korean Air, Norwegian and Australia's Virgin Blue, to block what they allege are dangerous attempts to 
curb the use of export credit agency backing for passenger jet purchases.
"The real concern for us is how quickly this is moving, so we're stepping up our efforts to try to get more airlines on 
board to start lobbying against it," said Howard Millar, Ryanair finance director.
The new Aviation Alliance group is pitting itself against 24 US and European airlines, including Delta, British 
Airways, American Airlines and Lufthansa. These airlines say it is not fair that an informal agreement known as the 
home country rule prevents them from obtaining export credit support to buy their aircraft on what they say are the 
"significantly cheaper" terms available to their rivals such as Emirates, Ryanair and others.
The home country rule, which dates back to the 1980s, prohibits countries where Boeing and Airbus aircraft are 
built - the US, Germany, France, the UK and Spain - from providing export credit agency backing to their own 
airlines to help them buy aircraft.
The issue has become increasingly contentious since the credit crunch began, when export credit support reached 
unprecedented levels as banks and other traditional sources of aircraft financing retreated. -Willie Walsh, BA chief 
executive, said- two months ago that it amounted to Europe "funding the expansion of -Emirates ".
BA and the other home country airlines want the home market rule to be scrapped, export credit support levels 
capped at 20 per cent of aircraft deliveries and the price of export credit financing to be raised.

Alliance to battle against 24 carriers
Calls to abolish home country rule
Body
Ryanair and Emirates have taken the unusual step of joining forces with eight other airlines as a multibillion-dollar 
row over aircraft financing starts to split the world's largest airlines into two rival camps.
The Irish budget airline and Dubai's Emirates normally shun industry alliances. But on Thursday they revealed they 
had teamed up with carriers such as Etihad of Abu Dhabi, Korean Air, Norwegian and Australia's Virgin Blue to 
block what they say are dangerous attempts to curb the use of export credit agency backing for passenger jet 
purchases.
"The real concern for us is how quickly this is moving, so we're stepping up our efforts to try to get more airlines on 
board to start lobbying against it," said Howard Millar, Ryanair finance director.
The new Aviation Alliance group is pitting itself against 24 US and European airlines, including Delta, British 
Airways, American Airlines and Lufthansa.
These airlines say it is not fair that an informal agreement known as the home country rule prevents them from 
obtaining export credit support to buy their aircraft on what they say are the "significantly cheaper" terms that are 
available to their rivals such as Emirates, Ryanair and others.
The home country rule, which dates back to the 1980s, prohibits countries where Boeing and Airbus aircraft are 
built - the US, Germany, France, the UK and Spain - from providing export credit agency backing to their own 
airlines to help them buy aircraft.
The issue has become increasingly contentious since the credit crunch began, when export credit support 
ballooned to unprecedented levels as banks and other traditional sources of aircraft financing retreated.
Airlines in two camps over jet financing
Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, lashed out at the situation two months ago, saying it amounted to Europe 
"funding the expansion of Emirates ".
BA and the other home country airlines want the home market rule to be scrapped; export credit support levels 
capped at 20 per cent of aircraft deliveries and the price of export credit financing to be raised.
The Aviation Alliance airlines say they would be happy to see the home market rule abolished, but argue caps and 
higher fees could be disastrous in another financial crisis.
The issue is coming to a head in talks on a new set of global rules due to be finalised by the end of this year 
through the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Irish shares have fallen further this morning as the crisis in the country's finances comes to a head.

buying Irish just now.

A group of 10 international airlines that are the among the biggest beneficiaries of government subsidies to buy 
planes called Thursday for the scrapping of strict limits on export credit financing.
The Airline Alliance, comprising Cargolux, Emirates, Etihad, Korean Air, Norwegian, Oman Air, Pegasus Ryanair, 
Virgin Blue and Wizz Air, said they want the "home country" rule that prohibits access to so-called export credits to 
be eliminated.
Scrapping the rule would allow airlines from all countries to be eligible for government support to buy planes from 
Airbus and Boeing Co.
The issue is currently debated by the OECD, a global economic watchdog, amid pressure to revise a 1986 
"gentlemen's agreement" between the U.S. and the European Union to prevent a trade war between Boeing and 
Airbus. The U.S. and the EU agreed that airlines from the five "home countries" of the two manufacturers the U.S., 
France, Germany, Britain and Spain would not be able to receive government export support for their planes.
A separate grouping of 24 airlines from the home countries, including 15 members of the U.S. Air Transport 
Association and nine European carriers, have complained that the arrangement is unfair. They have called on 
governments to limit export credit agency-backed loans to 20 percent of any airline's or lessor's aircraft deliveries.
The issue has become more pressing to the industry since the global credit squeeze because airlines from the 
home countries have found themselves less able to raise the necessary finance to buy planes on constrained credit 
markets.
The new Airline Alliance said extending the export credits to all carriers would ensure a level playing field within the 
industry and protect hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs contrasting with claims from the home countries 
that export credits create an unfair playing field and cost jobs.
"We believe the proposals and current thinking are flawed," said alliance spokesman Howard Millar, adding that 
export credits are necessary to ensure aircraft purchases can be financed during critical periods like the global 
economic downturn and high fuel costs.
Airline alliance wants finance rules scrapped
The group has sent letters to all the major parties in the OECD negotiations, including US Treasury Secretary 
Timothy Geithner, British Treasury chief George Osborne and French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.
It wants no limit on the amount of export credits extended to any airline and no increase in the current up front 
exposure fees.
The alliance comprises 10 airlines operating 833 aircraft with aircraft orders worth $129 billion.
"Without export credit financing, a very significant portion of aircraft delivered over the past few years wouldn't have 
been financed," Millar said, noting that loans dried up after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Bros.
In 2009, about 35 percent of Boeing and Airbus sales were financed by export credit agencies, according to the 
manufacturers, up from about 20 percent before the economic downturn. This year, the export credit agencies in 
the U.S. and Europe are expected to guarantee more than $15 billion in civil aviation loans, about the same as in 
2009.
Export agencies, set up to help finance exports to countries with weaker credit, usually require quicker repayment 
than commercial loans and impose more restrictions on the airlines.
The new alliance rejected suggestions from some industry players that the credits give carriers with access to them 
an uncompetitive advantage and encourage over-expansion.
The OECD has set an end of year deadline to determine the future of the rules.

Shares in the Irish banks seemed to have bottomed out this morning after their precipitate falls earlier this week.
AIB was unchanged at 34c a short time ago, while Bank of Ireland gained 2c to a still woeful 28.
Irish Life and Permanent has gained 1c to 64.
The banks have been hammered by a likely increase in the state shareholding of the big two. They are also finding 
it impossible to raise funds at the moment on the financial markets. The ISEQ index was 3.67 points lower a short 
time ago at 2,682.43, reversing some of yesterday's 22 points gain. Away from the banks, shares were mixed. 
Smurfit Kappa is down 21c to 720, Ryanair is off 3c to 393 and CRH has slipped 1c to 1430. On the rise are Elan , 
by 4c to 404, and Kerry Group up 6c to 2516.

Ryanair today said it will make good on its offer to the Government to bring an additional six million passengers to 
Ireland after Tourism Minister, Mary Hanafin signalled the dropping of the E10 air travel tax.
She said that the tax had not returned the revenues expected and so abolishing it was "up for consideration".
Speaking at Failte Ireland's annual conference yesterday, Minister Hanafin said that instead of the tax returning the 
projected figure of E125 million it would only return E80 million.
However, she pointed out that "E80 million is E80 million and every million euro is hard fought for", and said that 
another revenue-generating strategy would need to be put in place if the tax were to be abolished. Ryanair today 
said that Minister Hanafin appears to have "forgotten" Ryanair's current proposals to deliver 6m new passengers 
to/from Ireland annually, spread across Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. "These proposals were presented to 
Minister Hanafin at the Tourism Forum in Collins Barracks on 6th September last and were subsequently confirmed 
in writing directly to her," it said. Ryanair notes that Minister Hanafin has now met with both Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
to discuss how to reverse the alarming decline in tourism. "Since Ryanair has offered to deliver 6m additional 
passengers annually, what exactly has Aer Lingus offered to do? Ryanair's proposals are contingent upon making 
Ireland a competitive destination once more, which involves scrapping the E10 tourist tax and reversing the recent 
and equally damaging cost increases at the Government owned DAA monopoly airports," it said.

Anti-austerity General Strike Cripples Portugal
Anti-austerity General Strike Cripples Portugal

(RTTNews) - Normal life in Portugal is coming to a standstill on Wednesday, as public and private-sector workers 
joined the country's biggest-ever strike in protest against the debt-ridden government's austerity measures that will 
cut wages, pensions, and jobs drastically.
An unprecedented unity among private and public-sector workers in the protest against the government's cost-
cutting measures means the country's transport, industry, education, banks, media and petroleum product supplies 
are set to be severely affected by the 24-hour general strike.
It was the first joint strike since 1988 by the country's two largest trade union confederations -- UGT and CGTP -- 
representing 1.5 million workers in the public and private sector.
Unions have warned that more than 500 domestic and international flights are due to be canceled across the 
country, and major ports including Lisbon and Setubal will be paralyzed, as air traffic controllers are also taking part 
in the walk-out.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus have canceled six flights between Irish and Portuguese destinations.
Ryanair, which has grounded about 60 flights across Europe due to the strike, urged the European Commission to 
remove the bloc's air traffic controllers' right to strike as civil aviation comes under essential service.
The unions claimed that two of the most important commuter train lines into Portugal's capital city have been shut 
down, with workers on the Lisbon Metro joining the strike en-bloc at midnight.
The budget is expected to pass through the Parliament in Lisbon on Friday, because the Opposition Social 
Democratic Party (PSD) has promised not to vote against the measures, but abstain from voting in the best 
interests of the country's fragile finances.
Under intense pressure to cut a high level of national debt which is undermining its economy and fueling market 
concerns that it may need a bail-out, Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos had no choice other than 
announcing a number of cost-cutting measures such as reducing wages for public-sector workers and freeze 
pensions next year, and increase taxes to help pay off the debt.
Lisbon has proposed to increase VAT to 23 per cent, the highest rate in Europe.
Anti-austerity General Strike Cripples Portugal
The Portuguese government is committed to reduce national deficit from 7.3 per cent to 4.6 per cent of GDP in 
2011 in an effort to convince international investors that it will not be forced to seek a bail-out like Ireland or Greece.
Portuguese workers are the latest to join a wave of industrial actions that other troubled euro economies such as 
Greece and France have been witnessing in the latter half of 2010, as governments are forced into unpopular cost-
cutting programs to overcome mounting deficits or to conform to bail-out commitments.
The Greek government had been taking a number of austerity measures since March to battle its budget-deficit 
crisis, inviting a series of anti-government protests.
Public anger raged over French government's move to reform the country's pension system as part of austerity 
measures weakened with President Sarkozy vowing to press on with the austerity measures saying that there is no 
other way out.
Socialist Prime Minister Jose Socrates has categorically denied that Portugal will be forced to seek an European 
Union bailout like Ireland or Greece, saying that his country did not need financial aid.

From Mr Paul O'Kane.
Sir, Your report on the opening of Dublin airport's new passenger terminal (" Funereal gloom greets new Dublin 
terminal ", November 20) contained a number of factual inaccuracies.
Terminal 2 is not three times over budget, nor is it two years late. The construction cost of Terminal 2 and its 
associated facilities is just over EUR600m, in line with the budget when the design for the project was launched.
When T2 received planning permission in August 2007, Dublin Airport Authority said T2 would open in April 2010. It 
opened last Friday, seven months behind schedule.
The statement that T2 "was built for an airport handling 12m passengers a year - but industry officials say it will be 
lucky to see 6m" is incorrect. Dublin airport handled 18.4m passengers in 2005, when plans for Terminal 2 began to 
be advanced. This year, it is expected that more than 18.5m passengers will use the airport. In its first full year of 
operation, Terminal 2 is expected to process close to 8m passengers.
The suggestion within the article by Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, that T2 is "a bankrupt property 
development" is untrue.
At the end of its last financial year, DAA had EUR635m in cash and EUR560m worth of undrawn borrowing 
facilities. Its net debt was EUR616m. Based on current expectations, the company is fully funded until 2014, and 
Standard & Poor's noted last month that its liquidity was "strong". DAA has already made a formal complaint to the 
Irish Stock Exchange in relation to Mr O'Leary's misleading statements about the company's finances.
Terminal 2 was not state funded, as the report claims. DAA is state owned, but receives no exchequer funding. T2 
was funded through DAA's commercial revenues, aeronautical charges and borrowings.

Public Affairs Director,

Irish bank shares have dived again this morning on expectations of an even greater takeover of the sector by the 
government than previously thought.
AIB is down another 6c, or 15pc, to 27, with Bank of Ireland dropping by 4c, or 13pc, to 26.
The latest calls follow last night's leak to RTE of the shape of the bailout offer to be made by the IMF and EU to the 
government.
According to the station, it will involve a major restructuring the banking sector that will see Bank of Ireland 
becoming majority state controlled and AIB being owned 99.9pc by the state. The ISEQ index had dropped by 8pc 
a short time ago to 2,655.82. Other shares were mixed this morning, reflecting a generally upbeat mood on markets 
across Europe this morning. CRH is ahead by 5c to 1427, and Ryanair has lifted by 5c to 383. Elan is down 7c to 
388 and Smurfit kappa has fallen by 3c to 722.

Tony Fernandes, the Malaysian entrepreneur behind AirAsia, is to bring his chain of budget hotels to the UK with 
financial backing from a consortium of investors that includes Naguib Kheraj, deputy chairman of Lazard.
The investment group, which also includes equity backing from Mountgrange, the property fund manager, aims to 
build a £100m chain of 15 hotels with 1,500 beds in London by 2017.
They will be operated under a franchise agreement with Tune Hotels, the Asian budget chain started by Mr 
Fernandes to provide affordable accommodation for AirAsia customers.
The venture is seen as the first step into the European market for Tune, with plans to take the brand into other 
European destinations as well as regions in the UK.
Tune is also planning more than 100 sites in China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Middle East. The first hotel 
has already been opened in Westminster and a second site has been secured near the Broadgate complex in the 
City of London. Further developments are expected to be drawn from secondary commercial property space, such 
as former office buildings that need to be sold.
The company is in discussions on a number of additional sites in the capital.
The Tune Hotel concept is similar to that operated by Ryanair, where the occupier pays a basic fee for a bed and 
shower and then additional amounts for extras. Like budget airlines, it runs an internet-driven marketing model with 
pricing linked to demand and lower rates for early booking.
The investors have formed a company called Raag Hotels that has an initial equity capital of £38m to start the 
London chain.
They will own a share of the operating company as well as the underlying property. Mr Kheraj is personally 
investing in the business and will also remain a consultant.
No-frills hotels arrive in capital
The company has engaged Queensway Hotels, a company owned by the Jivraj family, to manage its assets. Mark 
Lankester, chief executive of Tune Hotels, said London was a key market internationally.
It is aiming for a basic property yield of about 10 per cent, but this would be as much as 18 per cent when using 
debt.

The Advertising Standards Authority in Britain has cleared a Ryanair advert attacking easyJet's punctuality, which 
used images of Robert Mugabe.
Ryanair's newspaper ad featured a picture of the Zimbabwean dictator underneath the headline "Here's easyJet's 
new head of punctuality".
There were three press cuttings included in the ad, with one headline reading "easyJet in punctuality blow," and the 
other two stating "less punctual than Air Zimbabwe".
There were 20 complaints from the public objecting to the use of Mugabe's image, claiming it "trivialised" the recent 
past and political circumstances of Zimbabwe. One complainant said claiming that easyJet's punctuality could not 
match Ryanair's service was misleading and unsubstantiated, believing the comparison was based on data from 
just one airport. Ryanair said it used Mugabe in reference to figures released earlier this year which showed Air 
Zimbabwe had more punctual at London Gatwick than easyJet.

Travelling on the 11am Aircoach from Cork to Dublin, wi-fi working fine, hurtling down a new motorway, it's difficult 
to imagine that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is already here.
At a certain level, the place seems almost prosperous.
Granted, over the past year the type of person on the bus has changed, but apart from that, not much else screams 
'bankrupt country'.
Last year, the bus was full of students, immigrants and the elderly. Last Friday, there was a significant increase in 
the proportion of swankier commuters, many well-heeled types, with quite posh luggage, heading to Dublin Airport.
This proves the point that, in a recession, it's not that the middle classes don't go on holiday, it's just that they take 
the bus and fly Ryanair. It also suggests that, for some people, austerity hasn't begun to bite.
But it will be felt, and the IMF will make sure of that.
The question we need to ask is will they - the EU and the IMF - make things better or worse.
Let me paint a picture of how they could make things immeasurably better. In order for this to happen, we, the Irish 
people, must show our government that we support the option which applies the basic rules of capitalism in such 
away as to strengthen Ireland as fast as possible.
Again, the solution begins and ends with the banks and the nature of the bank bailout.
If the IMF/EU simply follow the course of action that the present shambolic government is pursuing, we are 
doomed.
That policy of paying every creditor in full is flawed and will lead to a further crisis down the road.
There is away out of this
The only way out of this banking mess is to have a bank resolution or law passed which turns the existing creditors 
of the banks into shareholders, whether they like it or not.
At a stroke, the huge debts of banks disappear and are borne by the creditors - which they should be - and we start 
again.
The Irish taxpayer is no longer on the hook and we do what the US did in the savings and loans debacle in the early 
1990s: we apply a market solution to a market problem.
This will not be pretty, but it will work.
Are we too far down the 'pay all bondholders' road to do this?
No, we are not; in fact, the arrival of the IMF makes a reversal of the financially suicidal policy easier.
Why might that be?
There are four reasons: one based on law, a second on the reality of the bond market, the third based in the reality 
of corporate finance and the fourth based on personal vanity and ambition.
First, we have no bank resolution law in Ireland, so we can do what we want from here. We could now pass a law 
that says the Irish approach to bank resolutions will be based on debt/equity swaps, where shareholders and 
subordinated debt holders take the first hit.
Anyone who knows anything about banks will know that the only things of value in a bank are core deposits.
The reason is very simple: core deposits are what makes a bank a bank.
And when all the fancy stuff is done, the only things a bank will buy from another bank are deposits, because 
deposits are the type of capital you want: steady, cheap and largely sticky.
A bank with a good deposit base has strong foundations.
This is why Anglo Irish Bank was a boiler house: it had little by way of a real deposit base, at least as we 
traditionally understand the term deposit.
So the resolution law protects depositors with an ECB-backed deposit insurance scheme.
Once the law is passed, expect some legal challenges, but as these challenges will be in Irish courts, it will be 
difficult for us to lose.
Creditors will then split into realistic creditors, who take the deal constituting the new reality and get on with the 
business of forward-looking capital, and rogue creditors, who will try to drag us to court threatening all sorts of 
sanctions.
Well, frankly, let them at it.
This will not matter after awhile.
The second reason we can do this under the umbrella of the IMF is that the IMF's involvement here means we don't 
have to go back to the bond market for at least three years. So it gives us time to sort out our house, without having 
to worry about bond traders determining our next move.
Don't forget that the markets are not wise, they are bullies, and the way to stand up to a bully is to threaten him.
We threaten him with a new debt/ equity-based bank resolution law and he will be brought to heel.
In addition, after the debt/equity swap, the overall financial position of Ireland becomes immeasurably stronger.
There is away out of this
Our balance sheet becomes much more attractive and the consequent risk of investing here diminishes.
This means that the bond yields will fall rapidly, not rise. The third reason that there might be a way out for us 
relates to corporate finance. Think about what is happening.
The IMF/EU are injecting fresh capital into Ireland. The rules of capitalism say that new capital always takes 
precedence over old capital.
This means that IMF money will be 'senior' to all the other money invested by anyone up to now. As a 
consequence, the process of dilution of old creditors is already under way.
So the ECB and the bondholders who are already in the game now realise that they are 'junior' to the new capital 
and this means in plain English that they won't get their money back on the terms they originally thought they 
would.
Not pretty, but no one said lending to a bankrupt country would be pretty.
Finally, there is the issue of vanity and ambitions.
The president of the IMF is Dominique Strauss-Kahn and guess what job Domo wants next? Yes, you got it: he 
wants to be president of France.
Now wouldn't it be great for Domo if he saved Ireland and in the process saved the euro with a sensible debt/equity 
deal which allowed Ireland to grow, penalised hedge funds in the subordinated debt market and made bondholders 
realise that there are risks in reckless lending?
By saving the euro and Spain from contagion, Dominique could appear to be what all French presidential hopefuls 
want to be: a great international statesman.
We could facilitate this for him, if only he'd see the wisdom of a large IMF and EU sponsored debt/equity swap.
The course of action outlined above is one way the humiliation of the IMF can be turned to our advantage. Can we 
do it?
Yes we can. But it can only be executed by people who have the interest of Ireland at heart, who can see clearly in 
the crisis and who understand that, in these negotiations, everyone needs away out. We need a way out, the EU 
needs away out, the ECB needs away out and the IMF needs a way out.
The above is one such way.
By the way, government ministers reading this, you can have the advice for free. It won't cost you tens of millions in 
fees.
Yours, a concerned citizen

A  3million seed venture fund for start-up technology companies is to be launched at DCU tomorrow.
A total of 24 early stage companies will be supported over the next two years by the fund, which will be called 
Propeller, and is being run by DCU's Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship.
The programme is to be launched by EU Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science Máire Geoghegan-
Quinn.
The fund is being financed by the One Foundation, which is funded by businessman Declan Ryan, son of Ryanair 
founder Tony Ryan. It will be governed by a technology advisory board, chaired by Ryan.
More than 20 start-up companies have already been in discussions with the academy, and  1 million has already 
been raised. Another  2 million is to be raised in the coming years to develop the programme.
The online application process will go live tomorrow, and it is hoped that the programme will be of interest to start-
ups in other EU countries and beyond.
The Propeller programme also plans to link the corporate sector in Ireland to the start-up sector. A number of 
Ireland's leading companies have been approached about providing senior executives as mentors.
The programme will provide a package of corporate and service support, including marketing, accounting, legal and 
intellectual property advice.
A number of companies have already signed up, including Sage Ireland, Arthur Cox, Publicis D, Tomkins IP and 
Enterprise Ireland.

A Ryanair ad which poked fun at the ''fanciful'' claims of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was not likely to 
cause widespread office, the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled.
The ASA received 20 complaints from members of the public about the ad, which ran in the Daily Telegraph and 
Guardian newspapers.
The ad for the Irish low fares airline was headlined ''Here's EasyJet's new head of punctuality'', with a picture of 
Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.
The ad featured press cuttings which said: ''EasyJet 'less punctual than Air Zimbabwe' ".
The 20 complainants objected that the use of Mugabe's image was offensive because it trivialised Zimbabwe's 
recent past and political circumstances. One complainant also challenged the punctuality claim, which he said was 
based on only one airport.
Ryanair claimed the ad was ''humorous'' and said the image of Mugabe was used because he was the most 
recognisable Zimbabwean in the world.
The Daily Telegraph believed the ad was unlikely to cause serious offence because it did not refer to conditions of 
life in Zimbabwe, but played only on Mugabe's reputation for being fanciful with his claims.
The Guardian did not respond to the ASA.
Ryanair said the ad related to a recent punctuality comparison for Gatwick airport, but that figures from the Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) showed that Ryanair had been more punctual than EasyJet at British airports since 2007.
The ASA acknowledged that the use of Mugabe's image was ''likely to be seen as tasteless by some'', but 
considered it was unlikely to cause offence to most readers.
Ryanair Mugabe ad complaints rejected
It also said that, based on the CAA data, Ryanair's claim about punctuality was not misleading, so no further action 
was necessary.

As the economy slides down a slippery slope, those lucky enough to be able to afford it might still be considering 
getting away to icy slopes of a different kind to escape the gloom.
But before you head for the nearest snowy mountain, think about how you will cover your costs if any mishaps 
occur.
While ski holidays themselves can be expensive, unexpected delays, medical expenses or stolen items can add to 
the burden.
Choosing adequate travel insurance may mean an increased spend at the outset, but could significantly reduce 
your expenditure in the event of a holiday disaster.
According to a recent survey by AA, broken fingers are the most common injury cited in skiing claims. However, the 
survey found that about 7 per cent of all those who took winter sports holidays had no travel insurance.
Research by VHI found that just 35 per cent of people had travel insurance. Of these, some 15 per cent opt for 
single trip insurance, while the remaining 20 per cent take out annual cover for multiple trips.
Cost
The Sunday Business Post surveyed a number of insurers on the cost of cover for a ski trip in Europe (see table).
Ryanair provided the cheapest quote, at  14.50 for cover for one adult for a one-week ski holiday to a European 
destination.
If you plan to take the youngsters, online insurer Getcover.com provided the cheapest quote for a child for a week's 
skiing in Europe at  7.60.
On the right track for insurance
Some insurers, such as VHI and Allianz, do not provide single-trip travel insurance, but offer annual policies, which 
typically offer better value for frequent travellers.
Axa and Justcover.ie offer the cheapest annual policy for skiers.
Both insurers quote  39 for annual cover for an adult and a child, based on travel to European destinations only.
Generally, including winter sports cover in an annual travel insurance premium will bump up the cost, since insurers 
consider skiing a high-risk activity.
Cover
However, the cheapest policy is not always the best, as the level of cover provided by a basic policy may not meet 
your needs.
The biggest difference typically applies to medical expenses. If you are unfortunate enough to require significant 
treatment abroad - and possible repatriation - you will face a hefty bill.
''Our main cost exposure would be overseas medical emergencies," said a spokeswoman for Vhi. ''A typical 
overseas medical claim would cost  2,069 for hospital cover and  11,904 for repatriation to Ireland."
Cover for medical expenses typically extends to millions (see table), with four insurers covering for  10 million or 
more. AIB's cover for medical expenses is unlimited, while Aer Lingus provides cover for  13 million.
AA provides  11million and Multitrip.com, part of Blue Insurances, offers maximum cover of  10 million for medical 
expenses.
Chances are most holiday insurance claims will relate to far more mundane things, like lost bags, late flights and so 
on.
Cover limits for more common occurrences are typically lower.
But don't just look at cover for the big ticket items, such as medical expenses, when choosing a policy.
A spokeswoman for Getcover.com said an average medical expenses claim was  633, but holiday cancellations 
comprised the most common claim.
Ryanair's spokesman said that about one in 20 people on winter sports trips made a claim on their travel insurance, 
with a typical payout of between  300 and  350.
Terms and conditions to watch
When you are choosing a policy, it's important to understand the terms and conditions and ensure your cover does 
what you want.
For example, the age brackets for child rates vary from one insurer to the next.
With some insurers, child rates apply up to the age of 18,while others provide child cover up to 23 once the person 
is in full-time education.
Most insurers offer family policies, but the definition of a family can vary, so make sure everyone in your clan is 
covered under the terms of your policy.
Some insurers deem a family to be two adults and up to four children, while others cover unlimited children on a 
family policy.
On the right track for insurance
Avid skiers should also keep in mind that most annual travel insurance policies limit the number of days you can 
spend on the slopes. About 17 days is average.
Unexpected benefits
Some travel insurance policies provide additional benefits that you may not expect.
If your dream ski holiday is ruined due to an avalanche, you might be able to turn to your insurer, with most offering 
a few hundred euro.
For example, Axa and Allianz will cover for up to  300 in the event of an avalanche disrupting your ski trip.
You might think that a lost or stolen ski pass marks the end of your fun on the piste, but not all insurers agree.
For example, you will be covered for up to  600 by AA, while Multitrip.com covers the loss up to  300. Allianz and 
Justcover.ie do not cover this scenario.
Economic considerations
In a climate where businesses are collapsing left, right and centre, tourists might expect their travel insurance policy 
to provide some cover if a business failure affected their holiday.
However, if your airline collapses or your hotel ceases to trade, you may have less support than you expect.
Of the 12 insurers that responded to our winter travel insurance survey, only three provide cover for an airline or 
hotel going out of business.
AA and Multitrip.com provide cover up to  2,000, while Getcover.com provides up to  3,000.

The resort
Vale do Lobo, Algarve, Portugal.
Who'd love it?
Golfers who want to get away from it all with a group of friends. Vale do Lobo was the first resort built on the 
Portuguese Algarve and is home to two courses, the Royal and the Ocean, which have twice hosted the 
Portuguese Open.
There are three types of self-catering accommodation on offer - standard, superior and deluxe.
Our deluxe villa was luxurious, with a roomy living area, three double bedrooms, a kitchen and a small private pool.
Pamper potential
The Royal Spa, beside the main clubhouse, includes a swimming pool with a retractable glass roof, steam rooms, a 
Turkish hammam and a sauna. There's also a treatment room for couples, where we indulged in a an hour-long full 
body massage ( 70 per person).
Eating in
There are 15 restaurants in the resort, more than half of which are located in the beachside area known as the 
Praca. Prices are on the high side, but there is a good selection of food available, including pizza, crepes, steaks 
and seafood.
Out and about
Well Travelled
The nearest town to the resort is Almancil, where you can stock up on food and wine at Apolonia, Portugal's answer 
to Marks & Spencer - the local wines and black pork (pata negra) are well worth popping in your basket.
If you fancy eating out, try Irish chef Jonnie Pratt's Bistro des Z'Artes (www.bistroalgarve.com), where the menu 
includes French bistro classics and traditional Algarvian dishes with a twist - the pig cheeks with chestnuts and 
truffle mash are particularly good.
What we liked
The sleek, contemporary design of our villa, and the fact that the resort is a short drive away from Faro Airport.
What we didn't
The Paixa restaurant just inside the entrance to the resort, where the waiters displayed almost comical levels of 
snootiness. Avoid it unless you have a penchant for being made to feel inferior.
Getting there
Both Aer Lingus (www.aerlingus.com) and Ryanair (           www.ryanair.com) fly direct from Dublin and Cork to 
Faro. From there, it's around 40 minutes drive to the resort.
Cost and contact
A range of golf, spa and holiday packages are available at the resort, including the Play package, which is priced at  
97 per person per day including breakfast, three rounds on the Ocean course and two rounds on the Royal Course. 
This price is based on a minimum of two people sharing.

The champagne was flowing but no one could describe the demeanour of Brian Cowen, Ireland's prime minister, as 
celebratory when he opened Ireland's largest construction project on Friday.
After a momentous week, with officials from the International Monetary Fund and European Union in Dublin to draw 
up a financial bail-out, Mr Cowen was on a rare public engagement - officiating at the formal opening of T2, Dublin's 
space age airport terminal.
An award-winning design, this EUR600m ($820m) state-funded project at one time employed 2,500 construction 
workers.
In better times it would have been a good news story. But after what Eamon Gilmore, Labour party leader, dubbed 
"the blackest week since the Irish civil war", even Mr Cowen's speechwriters found it hard to envision the sunny 
uplands.
"T2 was designed and built not just for this year or the next, but for many decades into the future. To view it through 
the prism of the current downturn would be short-sighted in the extreme," Mr Cowen told the audience of ministers, 
ambassadors and Irish business figures.
T2 was meant to be a symbol of Ireland's modern, outward-looking economy - but now it is in danger of becoming 
yet another example of the overblown optimism of the Celtic Tiger years.
The project was three times over budget and two years behind schedule. It was built for an airport handling 12m 
passengers a year - but industry officials say it will be lucky to see 6m. The Dublin Airport Authority, the state body 
that owns it, has been saddled with huge debts to finance the project and faces claims by unpaid subcontractors, 
who staged a protest at the airport on Friday.
Funereal gloom greets new Dublin terminal
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair and arch-critic of the project - and of the DAA - was typically 
excoriating. "This a fitting tribute to the state of our economy. We have a big bankrupt property development out 
here run by a bunch of incompetent civil servants and bureaucrats," he said, dressed in top hat and tails - the 
traditional costume for a country undertaker in Ireland - to emphasise his view that this was no celebration.
"It will provide a nice welcoming lounge for the IMF officials that come here and will be a reminder every time they 
come through of why Ireland is broke."
A British business traveller on the inaugural flight from Manchester welcomed the airport: "It's nice to have a new 
terminal and something positive to talk about in Ireland with everything [that is] going on."
But the Irish were in no mood to see the bright side. "I suppose they're getting it ready for all the young people 
trying to emigrate," said William Humphries, a Dublin taxi driver in the long queue at the old terminal.
T2 may indeed witness an increasing flow of emigrants in the next few years at least. The Economic and Social 
Research Institute forecasts net emigration will almost double in 2011 from 34,000 to 60,000.
"Every time I hear people talking about it I get the shivers," says Kevin McDermott, who runs mylocalnews.ie, a 
community bulletin board. "I can see the 1980s all over again. I graduated in 1987 and no one in my class stayed. I 
can see the same thing happening today."

On the day that the IMF begin poring over the books on Ireland's economic and banking debacle, the Taoiseach 
opened the brand new Terminal 2 facility at Dublin Airport, hailing it as a sign of the growth to come.
Dublin Airport's Terminal 2 is a E600 million investment in Ireland's future, according to Dublin Airport Authority 
(DAA) Chairman David Dilger as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary staged a mock funeral publicity stunt to highlight what 
he said was the death of Ireland's tourism.
The opening of the new terminal comes amid steadily falling air traffic and as major airlines cut back on flights.
However, the Taoiseach described the new terminal as a key infrastructural investment. "T2 was designed and built 
not just for this year or the next, but for many decades into the future," according to Mr Cowen. "To view it through 
the prism of the current downturn would be short-sighted in the extreme. By investing prudently in improved 
facilities, we are laying the foundations for future growth and prosperity; not just for Dublin Airport, but also for the 
wider Irish economy," Mr Cowed added as journalists from around the world sought answers to questions about the 
IMF / EU bailout. The new terminal was funded through a combination of commercial revenues, aeronautical 
charges and borrowings. But Michael O'Leary said that the final bill for T2 was close to E1.2 billion. "The DAA's 
E1.2bn T2 Taj Mahal perfectly represents 'modern Ireland' because it's an over-specified unnecessary E1.2bn 
bankrupt property development that the Irish airlines don't want and Irish tourism can't afford to pay for," he said. 
Dublin Airport's Terminal 2 is a E600 million investment in Ireland's future, according to Dublin Airport Authority 
(DAA) Chairman David Dilger. At its peak, Terminal 2 was the largest construction project in the state, and 
employed up to 2,600 workers on site. During three years of construction, more than 10,400 men and women were 
involved in the project and more than 1,000 new jobs will be created with the opening of the new terminal, he said. 
"Designed with the passenger in mind, T2 has been planned and built for the long-term," Mr Dilger said. "The new

terminal is the centrepiece of a five-year investment programme to expand, improve and upgrade Dublin Airport. 
Our passengers told us that they wanted better facilities and we have delivered them."

Body
Some 90 irate passengers staged a nearly five-hour sit-in on a Ryanair plane in Belgium early Wednesday, refusing 
to disembark after their flight was diverted due to fog. Authorities said some spat at airport staff.
The passengers, mostly French tourists returning from a Moroccan vacation, refused to leave after the plane landed 
about midnight at Liege airport because fog had closed down Beauvais airport in northern France.
"It was a very tense situation," said Christian Delcourt, the spokesman for the Liege Airport. "Some of these people 
were very aggressive, very rude."
Passengers from three other diverted Ryanair planes had accepted an offer of bus transportation to Beauvais, 350 
kilometers (225 miles) away. But those on the fourth plane refused to leave and haggled for hours with Ryanair 
officials who had asked them to wait inside the airport.
"The passengers were unreasonable and refused to follow the advice which would have allowed them to complete 
their journey," Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said in a statement.
He said Ryanair crew left "the aircraft when passengers became disruptive," adding it is "standard safety 
procedure" for airlines to divert to another airport when weather closes the destination airport.
Delcourt said the passengers finally left the plane at the request of police.
"Some were aggressive to airport staff. They spat at them," he told The Associated Press.

EasyJet in dividend debut as profits jump

EasyJet has decided to pay dividends for the first time after more than a year of lobbying for such pay-outs from Sir 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its founder and largest shareholder.
The news came as EasyJet, Europe's second largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers after Ryanair, on 
Tuesday reported that it had nearly trebled annual profits, joining the aviation resurgence that has seen carriers 
rebound after the downturn.
Carolyn McCall, chief executive, also announced a strategy to attract more business travellers with a type of fare 
that will give passengers unlimited flexibility to change their flight up to two hours before departure.
EasyJet, one of the few European airlines to report an annual profit last year, said that given its ability to generate 
cash and access reasonably priced finance, the board had decided on a formula that would trigger a dividend 
payment in profitable years.
The yearly payment would be based on a dividend cover of five times, and the first would be made in 2012, based 
on the year ending September 30 2011.
Sir Stelios, who quit the board in May to become a self-described "shareholder activist", fighting what he claimed 
was a strategy of "relentless growth in aircraft numbers" and urging instead a profit margin increase, welcomed the   
payment.
"This is a good first step but I would like to see the dividend pay-out ratio increased over time to 50 per cent of 
earnings per share," he said.
The payment is the second move EasyJet has made to improve relations with Sir Stelios.
Last month it signed a branding deal to settle a two-year row that could see Sir Stelios receive close to £100m 
($160m) in the first 10 years of the 50-year agreement, depending on how much money EasyJet makes.
EasyJet in dividend debut as profits jump
Some analysts have been concerned that the deal, on top of EasyJet's well-publicised summer airport operational 
disruptions, could put pressure on costs.
The carrier reported on Tuesday that its total underlying cost per seat had risen 5.2 per cent in the 12 months to the 
end of September, mainly driven by disruption caused by the closure of airspace because of volcanic ash in April, 
weather-related costs and its own operational difficulties over the summer.
All these problems amounted to a £97.9m increase over the previous year. Even excluding these problems, 
however, underlying cost per seat rose by 2.2 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose to £154m from £54.7m last year
Revenues increased 11.5 per cent to £2.9bn while passenger numbers went up nearly 8 per cent to 48.8m.
"The results are in line with expectations but there's some evidence of underlying cost pressure," said Douglas 
McNeill, transport analyst at Charles Stanley Securities.
EasyJet shares closed down 4.8 per cent in London trade.

Don't count Stelios out of the EasyJet reckoning

Who runs EasyJet? Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou or Carolyn McCall? The company's founder and dominant shareholder 
or a newspaper woman just turned airline chief executive? Track the share price on Tuesday - not to mention the 
substance of the management's strategy statement - and you could be forgiven for seeing Stelios in the cockpit.
First Ms McCall negotiated a brand leasing deal, untangling the EasyJet name from the other Easy brands that 
Stelios has applied over the years to ventures in everything from car hire to cafés.
The new strategy looks like an attempt to placate him some more. There is a maiden dividend pledge, a promise to 
negotiate aircraft orders not just with Airbus but also with Boeing, and a generally more cautious line on growth.
Investors more broadly seemed happy enough with the announcement of those commitments - at least until Stelios 
came out with his own announcement. Then the share price dipped sharply, closing nearly 5 per cent down.
Part of the fall may have been profit-taking on the back of decent full-year profit numbers. But with Stelios and his 
family still controlling 38 per cent of the shares - and the man himself infamous for his tense relations with 
management (before and after he left the board in the spring) - there is almost certainly an element of a Stelios 
discount in the price.
Having said that, the stock trades broadly in line with Ryanair at about 10 times 2011 earnings. And the new 
dividend pledge of an ongoing pay-out pitched at 20 per cent of net profits will add a small but worthwhile yield in a 
market not known for sustainable dividends.
Ms McCall is keen to stress the smoothness of relations with Stelios these days. His statement was certainly less 
abrasive than usual. But one sentence still grated. On the dividend he wrote: "This is a good first step. But I would 
like to see the dividend pay-out ratio increased over time to 50 per cent of earnings per share."
He is dreaming. No airline in the world can sustain such a ratio. But it is, perhaps, symptomatic of his keenness for 
cash in today's turbulent economic times.
Don't count Stelios out of the EasyJet reckoning
Stelios himself dismisses such suggestions as "complete rubbish". There is no way of knowing for sure how 
stretched the rest of his private business interests are. But he certainly has no other cash cow in his Easy empire.
For fellow shareholders - and for Ms McCall - the risk is that Stelios does not see the new strategy as drawing a line 
under previous conflicts. Rather it could steel his resolve to begin a new campaign and extract yet more of what he 
wants.

fortunately auspicious circumstances. Annual profits are expected to be almost three times higher than last year at 
£154.5m. But McCall, a newcomer to the airline industry, won't have long to bask in the glory: there is a fierce 
debate raging over the firm's future - and she will have to pick a side.
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's founder and largest shareholder, thinks it is time to put the brakes on expansion. 
He wants easyJet to cap aircraft numbers at 200 (the current total is 196) and only operate routes that are profitable 
all year round, instead of grounding some aircraft in the winter months. He also wants to reduce the annual target 
for growth in seats to "GDP plus something" rather than the much-higher 7.5 per cent.
Of course, Stelios' prudence should be heeded, but McCall needs to consider the other shareholders, who make up 
64 per cent of the register, as well.
There are several reasons why McCall can afford to be more bullish.
Having agreed 88 options and purchase rights for new aircraft during the downturn, easyJet is unlikely to expand its 
fleet at such a low cost in the near future. And while GDP growth will be anaemic in Europe, it can use this to its 
advantage by winning business from other low-cost carriers and regional players. Operating more medium-haul 
routes, such as London to Luxor, Egypt, which begins service this month, will also help it grow.
Ryanair's fleet will swell to 299 by 2013. Easyjet needs to catch up.

Irish shares were mixed this morning at the start of a week that could determine the country's financial future.
With bond yields edging a tad higher early on, and talks continuing with EU partners on aid, the mood is highly 
uncertain.
The ISEQ index was 7.91 points lower a short time ago at 2,667.82.
Kingspan has slipped 7c to 595 after a management statement this morning saying that business had eased after a 
strong third quarter. Other big names were mixed, with CRH down 4c, Ryanair down 5c and Kerry Group off by 8c. 
On the rise were Smurfit Kappa, up 2c to 770 and Elan up 10c to 435. AIB has slipped by 1c and Bank of Ireland by

Highlight: Economy watch
Body
In a week in which the stock market hit its highest levels since the world's financial-system meltdown in 2008, 
Economy Watch is feeling a warm, fuzzy glow.
And that's not all. A closely watched survey of employers in the UK's services sector reported rising demand for the 
second month in a row while a similar review of the manufacturing sector showed output rising month on month. 
Even better, manufacturers' employment intentions accelerated at the fastest rate since 1995.
The good news is making itself felt in corporate results. Both Stagecoach and FirstGroup reported improved profits 
from increased passenger numbers as more commute to work. Ryanair said rising passenger numbers and air 
fares helped its profits, proving that consumers still have discretionary income. And John Lewis, purveyor to 
Britain's middle classes, said that the last week of October - as half-term week, this is the best guide to Christmas 
sales - saw a strong boost after a few weeks of tepid sales rises.
In fact, the general outlook appears so positive that the UK's interest rate setters at the Bank of England passed up 
the opportunity to give another boost to demand - unlike their counterparts at the US Federal Reserve. Corporate 
insolvencies continue to fall, although personal bankruptcies are close to record levels.
Alas, the full picture is not so simple. While Economy Watch focuses on events in Britain, we cannot ignore, for 
instance, the impact of soaring prices of commodities produced elsewhere. This week, crude oil hit a six-month 
high, gold prices set a new record and prices are soaring for a range of agricultural products, from wheat to cotton.
How does this affect us? The prices of goods leaving the factory gate jumped in October by much more than 
expected; those made with petroleum leapt highest. Next, the fashion chain, warned that higher cotton prices meant 
clothes would cost more by early next year. Unilever, which produces a range of household goods, issued a similar 
warning. Morrisons, the supermarket chain, reported subdued sales and warned of more pressure on consumers 
next year.
Jobs outlook chills market glow
Customers, too, are feeling the pinch. Imperial Tobacco benefited from customers trading down to roll their own.
A closely watched house-price index was up for the month, but only enough partially to offset a record loss in 
September. Lloyds Banking Group conceded that the rising costs of raising money for itself has eaten into its 
profits.
Moreover, the bad news may just be beginning. A respected independent institute said that fierce spending cuts 
over the next six years were likely to lead to higher job losses i n the private sector than in the public sector. The 
private sector needed to create 1.6m jobs just to keep unemployment where it was now.
Economy Watch is still enjoying the warm glow of a resurgent stock market. But rising prices and increasing job 
losses may mean we have less to spend in months ahead.

Body
The ISEQ lost all of the gains it made on Thursday in Friday's session amid mounting concerns over the Irish 
economy.
The index fell 54.90 points to 2,701.51.
Investors again dumped Irish bonds, reflecting scepticism that Ireland can rapidly reverse its budget deficit without 
driving its economy deeper into recession. The amount investors demand to hold Irish 10-year debt passed 7.7pc 
this morning and the spread between Irish bonds and the benchmark German bund stands at 533 points. Ireland's 
debt woes come as a Europe-wide government debt crisis shows signs of flaring up again.
Investors in London and Dublin sold off Bank of Ireland shares amid fears that the bond markets will scupper 
Ireland's economy and force it to seek help from the IMF and the ECB's recovery fund. Shares in the bank slumped 
5c to E0.44 on the ISEQ - its lowest level since June of 2009. AIB's stocks reached a 15-month low of E0.27 - down 
3c on the day. Irish Life and Permanent shares were down nearly 20pc or 26c to E1.05. "A lot of that is about 
insecurity," said Tom Shaw, an analyst at brokerage house Goodbody. "The international bond market seems 
unconvinced that our (Irish) attempts to cut 6 billion euros (in 2011) are sufficient to restore the economy and the 
pace for growth in the future. There is a big credibility issue," he said. Another Geneva-based trader said a renewed 
rise in the credit default swap (CDS) prices of Ireland had weighed on the Bank of Ireland share price. The euro fell 
as concerns over Ireland's austerity budget prompted a widening in peripheral euro zone bond spreads, in turn 
allowing the dollar some respite from a run of heavy losses. The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish 
government bonds rather than German benchmarks rose to a euro lifetime high after Dublin proposed a budget 
some traders said was "unrealistic". Elsewhere, Aer Lingus shares fell 6c to E1.11 after it said its operating profits 
for the third quarter of this year are up 35.4pc to E79.2m. In an interim management statement, the airline said its 
yield per passenger is up 12.5pc for the three-month period and up 10.2pc in the year to date. Aer Lingus said its 
ISEQ slumps on fears over the economy ISEQ Down
revenue in the third quarter increased by 5.5pc compared to the same time last year, despite an 11.7pc reduction in 
capacity due to planned reductions in US and Gatwick services. Shares in Ryanair fell 4c to E3.99. Smurfit Kappa 
will report third quarter results on Wednesday November 10th. Davy are forecasting EBITDA of E238m, 24pc ahead 
of Q3 2009 and 8pc higher than the Q2 out-turn. This is on revenue of E1786m, implying an EBITDA margin of 
13.3pc - 70bps ahead of last year. Of key interest will be continuing momentum in terms of box volume growth and 
pricing, Davy said. There will be very little impact from the most recent containerboard price increases. Net debt is 
expected to decline by E120m sequentially to E3170m as a result of stronger EBITDA and the seasonal unwinding 
of working capital. SKG's shares fell 14c to E7.95.

PRICE is well known to be the single most powerful determinant of profit, so why continue to use guesswork more 
than science? What is the right price for your product and service? Do you really have an educated idea? Have you 
gone to the trouble of testing and checking different prices, or is it just an annual finger in the air exercise for you, 
after a quick look round at the competition? Perhaps you're more the "cost plus target margin" sort of guy? Have 
you ever stopped to ponder that almost everyone who has ever bought anything from you would almost certainly 
have paid you more; sometimes a lot more? Setting your prices lower than you could do is like holding four of a kind 
in a hand of poker and seeing two pairs.
AUSTERE TIMES In these more difficult and austere times, you might now reflect on just how important your 
pricing strategy is to the dream of that Aston Martin in the drive. Seriously successful companies like Google, Dell, 
Nike and IKEA, and even those we love to hate like Ryanair -- all offer crystal-clear propositions founded on and 
reinforced by bold and innovative pricing strategies. Pricing is not an aftera thought, it's the beating heart of a 
winning formula.
Only in a Monty Python sketch are your customers ever likely to come in and negotiate you up to a higher price. But 
it's a complicated zone in which to tread carefully. We will scream blue murder at Amazon for the late delivery of a 
CD sent across mountains, oceans and whole continents, from the other side of the world to your front door, but will 
unilaterally leave a voluntary 10 per cent tip to reward the arduous and complex logistical challenge of delivering a 
pizza all the way from the kitchen to our restaurant table.
EFFECTIVE PRICING The secret to effective pricing is to find multiple ways of placing yourself in the shoes of the 
customer, to be bothered enough to invest the necessary time to understand their situation and what it is that they 
value enough to pay for and to build your pricing model accordingly. Fairness and credibility are the critical 
PRICES NEED SCIENCE NOT GUESSWORK
backbone to every sustainable pricing strategy. So what should you do? Firstly, put your prices up if you offer good 
value. Don't be scared. Think about it. You instinctively know that lower prices would mean lower profits, unless 
you're redefining your whole sector a la eBay. So, why not go in the other direction and make more money? 
Secondly, offer differentiated prices to those who appreciate different aspects of the offer. Think Ryanair. If you 
want a cheap flight to Krakow, you need to remember to get in early because by booking last minute you will have 
paid about 50 times more than the guy now sitting to your left.
EASY TO FIND And finally, keep your prices easy to find, easy to read, easy to understand and reflective of your 
market positioning. It's always a mistake to con your customer, even if you can get away with it in the short term. 
That cheap Rolex you've had your eye on is a fake. As a rule of thumb, we do still get what we pay for.

The government will only sell its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus to a party that can guarantee its independence from 
Ryanair, chief executive Christoph Mueller has said.
In an interview with Reuters, he says the government will not sell its stake, valued at around 150m euros, to 
Ryanair because it would crush competition.
Ryanair already owns nearly 30pc of Aer Lingus.
"The government needs to make sure we are not taken over by Ryanair, because only two air carriers guarantee 
that the fares from London to Dublin remain very low," Mueller said. "They will only sell to a party which guarantees 
the independence of Aer Lingus," he added. He made his comments on the sidelines of an IBEC conference in 
Dublin. Aer Lingus has already fended off two hostile bids from Ryanair. Britain's Office of Fair Trading launched an 
investigation last week into Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus, which Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary subsequently 
called "a wild goose chase". Mueller said the probe was credible. The Aer Lingus boss also said he was exploring 
closer links with an Asian airline to give the airline access to markets in the region. "We are looking into more 
partnerships because we want to connect the world with Ireland and we still have a hole in Asia Pacific," Mueller 
said. "We do not have an Asian partner, which we are seeking. We are talking now." He added the partnership 
would not be sealed "any time soon". Aer Lingus already has a partnership with United Airlines on long-haul flights 
between Europe and North America.

In an interview with Reuters, he says the government will not sell its stake, valued at around 150m euros, to 
Ryanair because it would crush competition.
Ryanair already owns nearly 30pc of Aer Lingus.
"The government needs to make sure we are not taken over by Ryanair, because only two air carriers guarantee 
that the fares from London to Dublin remain very low," Mueller said. "They will only sell to a party which guarantees 
the independence of Aer Lingus," he added. He made his comments on the sidelines of an IBEC conference in 
Dublin. Aer Lingus has already fended off two hostile bids from Ryanair. Britain's Office of Fair Trading launched an 
investigation last week into Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus, which Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary subsequently 
called "a wild goose chase". Mueller said the probe was credible. The Aer Lingus boss also said he was exploring 
closer links with an Asian airline to give the airline access to markets in the region. "We are looking into more 
partnerships because we want to connect the world with Ireland and we still have a hole in Asia Pacific," Mueller 
said. "We do not have an Asian partner, which we are seeking. We are talking now." He added the partnership 
would not be sealed "any time soon". Aer Lingus already has a partnership with United Airlines on long-haul flights 
between Europe and North America.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported October passengers of 7 million, up 14% from 6.2 
million last year. Load factor was 85%, same as the prior year.
Year to date booked passenger figures include up to 1.45 million passengers who were booked to fly on flights 
which were cancelled due to the unnecessary closures of EU airspace during the volcanic eruptions in Iceland in

European banking stocks fell sharply in a broadly flat market hit by growing concerns that future sovereign bail-outs 
in Europe would force private investors to bear more of the financial burden.
Last week, European leaders agreed to discuss new regulations that would force investors to shoulder more 
responsibility in any further rescue packages, increasing the risk of owning already sensitive banks in Spain, Italy 
and Greece.
In Spain, Santander fell 3 per cent to EUR8.95 while BBVA lost 3.6 per cent to EUR9.11. Bankinter dropped 2.6 
per cent to EUR4.66 while Banco Popular  lost 3.2 per cent to EUR4.50.
Elsewhere in the periphery, bellwether National Bank of Greece fell 4.6 per cent to EUR7.51 while in Italy, 
UniCredit shed 3.6 per cent to EUR1.80, Mediobanca lost 1.7 per cent to EUR7.32 and Intesa Sanpaolo fell 1.8 
per cent to EUR2.49.
These losses dragged on the banking sector as a whole. Société Générale  gave up 1 per cent to EUR42.60 while 
Natixis fell 0.8 per cent to EUR4.37.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged up 0.1 per cent to 1,088.01, supported by positive manufacturing figures from the 
US and China.
In Portugal, the successful completion of an austerity budget for 2011 lifted the market, with motorway operator 
Brisa up 3.7 per cent to EUR5.64 and telecommunications group Sonaecom up 2.8 per cent to EUR1.67. 
Portugal's PSI 20 index gained 0.5 per cent to 8,121.28.
The German carmaking sector gained broadly amid speculation that third-quarter results from BMW, due on 
Wednesday, would beat forecasts. BMW shares rose 2.8 per cent to EUR52.96.  Continental , the German car 
parts maker, rose 3.6 per cent to EUR65.35 although
Banks suffer over bail-out fears
Individual stocks were hit by disappointing results. Ryanair fell 3.8 per cent to EUR3.97 after profits were weaker 
than expected. The airline unveiled a 25 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits, but failed to reach the 40 per 
cent gain the market was hoping for.

European banking stocks fell sharply in a broadly flat market hit by growing concerns that future sovereign bail-outs 
in Europe would force private investors to bear more of the financial burden.
Late last week, European leaders agreed to discuss new regulations that would force investors to shoulder more 
responsibility in any rescue packages, increasing the risk of investing in already-sensitive banks in Spain, Italy and 
Greece.
"The decision by European leaders to agree a mechanism that might lead to private investors bearing a greater 
brunt of the pain in another Eurozone sovereign debt crisis has done some damage to the more risky European 
banks," said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.
In Spain, Santander fell 3 per cent to EUR8.95 while BBVA lost 3.6 per cent to EUR9.11. Bankinter dropped 2.6 
per cent to EUR4.66 while Banco Popular  lost 3.2 per cent to EUR4.50.

Jeronimo Martins , the Portuguese retailer, jumped 4.7 per cent to EUR11.29 after the budget failed to include a 
VAT hike on basic foodstuffs. The German carmaking sector gained broadly amid speculation that third-quarter 
results from BMW, due on Wednesday, would beat forecasts.
BMW shares rose 2.8 per cent to EUR52.96. Continental , the German car parts maker, rose 3.6 per cent to 
EUR65.35 although Volkswagen missed the party as it dropped 2.7 per cent to EUR105.05.
Individual stocks were hit by disappointing earnings results. Ryanair fell 3.8 per cent to EUR3.97 after reporting a 
weaker-than-expected profit increase. Europe's biggest low-cost airline unveiled a 25 per cent increase in second-
quarter net profits, but failed to reach the 40 per cent gain the market was hoping for.
TNT , the Dutch postal and express delivery business, fell 4.2 per cent to EUR18.30, a 12-month low, after 
reporting worse-than-expected results due to pension and restructuring costs.
Nokia , the Finnish mobile phone handset maker, fell 2.6 per cent to EUR7.56 after the director of Germany's 
IPCom said that after a ruling last week it was confident of winning its patent fight to stop Nokia selling in key 
German markets.
But there was good news for German pharmaceutical company Bayer , which rose 1.1 per cent to EUR54.23 after 
a study found their stroke prevention drug worked.
Swiss cement maker Holcim gained 2.8 per cent to SFr63.05 as sector rival ACC, India's second-largest cement 
producer, said shipments in October had risen by 13.6 per cent on the previous year.
Telenor , the Norwegian telecommunications group, gained 2.9 per cent to NKr97.20 after Barclays Capital 
upgraded it to "overweight" from "equal weight".

The Dublin-based airline says it now expects to make a full-year net profit of between EUR380m and EUR400m 
($555m), up from its previous predictions of between EUR350m and EUR375m.
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have also upgraded their annual forecasts in recent weeks, while British Airways 
and Iberia last week bounced back into profit after recording steep losses during the 2008-2009 downturn that 
savaged airline earnings round the world.
Ryanair said it had made a pre-tax profit of EUR483m, up from EUR419m for the same period a year ago, as 
passenger numbers continued to increase and average fares rose by 12 per cent in the summer to EUR44.
But its results for the busy third-quarter summer months, traditionally the most profitable for European airlines, did 
not meet some analysts' forecasts and its shares were down 3.9 per cent by the close.
Analysts were broadly positive about the results, however, which showed half-year revenues rising 24 per cent to 
EUR2.2bn. Earnings per share rose from 25.21 cents to 28.31 cents.
"After three years of declines we expect average fares to recover strongly in the coming years on the back of a 
strengthening revenue environment," said Geert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon in a note to investors.
"Combined with a deceleration (and eventual standstill) in capacity growth, we believe this should translate into 
attractive and sustainable profit growth over the medium term."
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the airline was still on track to record 73.5m passengers for the full 
year, a figure that will dwarf that of many of its older rivals such as British Airways, though they fly passengers 
further.
Ryanair lifts outlook after earnings rise
Mr O'Leary said he expected average fares to rise over the next year as well, in part because consolidation among 
rival airlines led them to raise their ticket prices. But he said Ryanair's fares would remain well below competitors, 
including its closest budget rival, EasyJet, which reports its full-year results on November 16.
He said he expected baggage fees would also increase as part of Ryanair's deliberate policy of trying to discourage 
its passengers from taking too much heavy luggage.
"The charges are to change passenger behaviour," he said.
He agreed that signs of a relative slowdown in the airline's ancillary revenues, which includes baggage fees, travel 
insurance, onboard snacks and other non-ticket items, showed some passengers were changing the way they flew.

Highlight: Ban on goods from Somalia and Yemen
Germany urges global action
Body
The British government has introduced a range of emergency restrictions on air freight as other countries consider 
their response to last week's discovery of two bombs on board cargo jets bound for the US.
Theresa May, the UK home secretary, said on Monday she was suspending all unaccompanied air freight traffic 
from Somalia while stopping air passengers from carrying printer cartridges larger than 500g in hand luggage, and 
the shipping of cartridges by air from unapproved sources via or from the UK.
The two explosive devices were discovered inside cartridges in two printers at the UK's East Midlands airport and 
Dubai after tip-offs made to the intelligence services. The packages were bound from Yemen to the addresses of 
synagogues in Chicago.
The moves came as the German government called on the international community to work together in drawing up 
tougher security rules for air freight.
Ms May confirmed that the British government believed "that the [devices] were made and dispatched by the 
organisation known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula" - though she said there was no evidence of any further 
imminent attacks from the region.
US officials are leaning towards the belief that the mobile phone detonators in the bombs would have been used as 
timers, so it would not have been necessary for them to be within range of a terrorist to explode the devices.
The German call for harmonised rules reflect Berlin's belief that global transport can only be as safe as its weakest 
link, but also its fear that reduced security - and thus lower costs - elsewhere could hamper Germany's many 
exporters.
It is a fear that is shared by other European countries looking at introducing restrictions.
Britain places curbs on air freight
Air freight from Yemen to the UK has already been banned but Ms May said she had decided to do the same for 
Somalia "based on possible contact between al-Qaeda in Yemen and terrorist groups in Somalia, as well as 
concern about airport security in Mogadishu".
Germany also yesterday banned freight traffic from Yemen.
Ms May said the printer cartridge ban would be in place for at least a month to give the government time to "work 
closely with the aviation industry, screening equipment manufacturers and others, to devise a sustainable, 
proportionate, long-term security regime to address the threat".
Prior to the announcement Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief of Ryanair, a European budget airline, had warned 
against the introduction of more "ludicrous and useless" aviation security.
"You have meetings of Cobra [the UK government's emergency planning committee] because some people want to 
be seen to be doing something," Mr O'Leary said.
The UK transport ministry is in talks with industry to discuss what step can be taken. The question will now arise as 
to whether other countries will introduce similar bans.

Highlight: Security response
Body
Britain has banned air shipments of all printer cartridges by unapproved sources, in the most detailed response yet 
from a western government to last week's cargo jet bomb plot.
The UK said it would also halt all unaccompanied freight traffic from Somalia, as Germany joined the US, UK and 
France in introducing a ban on cargo flights from Yemen. The US has sent transport security experts to the Yemen 
capital, Sana, to bolster package-screening operation.
Theresa May, the UK home secretary, said passengers on commercial flights would be banned from taking printer 
cartridges on board as part of interim measures to be put in place for a month - allowing her government time to 
consider long-term plans for tightening security around air freight.
The two explosive devices were discovered inside ink cartridges in two printers at the UK's East Midlands airport 
and Dubai after tip-offs to the intelligence services. The packages were bound from Yemen to Chicago synagogues.
David Cameron, prime minister, on Monday told his senior security advisers that he must be advised immediately of 
any future terrorist incidents. Questions had been raised about why he was apparently told of the situation at East 
Midlands airport about 12 hours after Barack Obama, US president, was woken up by his officials to be informed of 
the developing plot.
US officials are leaning towards a belief that detonators in the bombs would have been used as timers, so it would 
not have been necessary for them to be within range of a terrorist for explosives to be set off.
Ms May said she had decided to ban air freight from Somalia "based on possible contact between al-Qaeda in 
Yemen and terrorist groups in Somalia, as well as concern about airport security in Mogadishu". She promised to 
"work closely with the aviation industry, screening equipment manufacturers and others, to devise a sustainable, 
proportionate, long-term security regime to address the threat".
Britain bans air shipments of ink cartridges
Security manufacturers such as Smiths Group and GEanticipate a glut of orders for their technology as attention 
shifts from passenger jets to air freight.
However, some senior aviation executives warned that governments were overreacting. Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, said: "They're laughing away in the caves of Yemen this 
morning at the British prime minister meeting with his Cobra security team [the UK's emergency planning 
committee] to discuss printer cartridges."
Any long-term tightening of security rules is likely to focus on express freight at the large parcel companies - UPS, 
FedEx, DHL - rather than the movements of high-value goods as part of the global supply chain.
Britain has promised to review "all aspects" of its freight security in partnership with other countries, matching a call 
by Germany for the international community to work together in devising tougher rules.

Airline's profit climbs 15 per cent
Passenger numbers and fares increase
Body
Ryanair became the latest airline to upgrade its annual earnings forecasts on Monday after reporting a healthy first-
half profit.
The Dublin-based airline said it expected to make a full-year net profit of between EUR380m (£329m) and 
EUR400m, up from its previous predictions of between EUR350m and EUR375m.
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have raised their annual forecasts in recent weeks, while British Airways and Iberia

RYANAIR, the low cost airline, yesterday announced profits of (EURO)452m (£392m) for the half year to 30 
September, an increase of 17 per cent on the same period in 2009.
The profits came on the back of a 23 per cent increase in revenues to (EURO)2.2bn. The airline increased its 
prediction for full-year net earnings, which it now expects to be in a range of (EURO)380m to (EURO)400m 
compared with previous guidance of (EURO)350m to (EURO)375m.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O''Leary said the results were "testimony to the robustness" of Ryanair's model, 
which "continues to deliver traffic and profit growth even during a deep recession".
He added: "We continue to gain market share across Europe. We expect this trend to continue." Passenger 
numbers increased from 36.4m to 40.1m, a rise of 10 per cent.
The increases came despite the airline being forced to cancel 9,400 flights following the Icelandic volcanic ash-
cloud in earlier in the year, which the firm says cost it (EURO)31.7m. Air traffic strikes in France, Belgium and Spain 
also led to the cancellation of 2,000 flights and delay of a further 12,000.
Ryanair's good results follow other positive news for the sector. Last week BA announced the first profits in two 
years, of £156m, for the six months to the end of September.
Franco-Dutch carrier Air France-KLM raised its full-year earnings guidance last week, having bounced back from 
losses incurred by the volcanic ash-cloud in the first half, while Germany''s Lufthansa also announced a higher-
than-expected operating profit of (EURO)628m in the third quarter of 2010.

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary yesterday predicted that the discovery of two bombs on UPS flights 
destined for Chicago will lead to "ludicrous" new security checks for passengers.
He predicted "another huge lurch by the securicrats into making travel even more uncomfortable and an even more 
tedious ordeal for the travelling public." He added: Sadly they always win the day and they lurch around with 
ludicrous new measures."
He said that terrorists would be "laughing away in their caves this morning at the prime minister and his security 
team meeting to discuss printer cartridges O'Leary's comments came as the British Airline Pilots' Association 
(Balpa) said that it has been warning for years that a focus on passenger security had "left the door open" for 
attacks on freight flights.
The home secretary Theresa May suggested that the bombs could lead to new checks. She said: "We are going to 
be looking at the security that we adopt in relation to freight. Meanwhile Lord Carlisle, who advised the former 
government on terrorism, said that he was so worried about alerting terrorists to lax security on cargo planes that he 
deliberately buried the information in a report he wrote in 2007.
He said it was "completely unrealistic" that all parcels could be screened properly. "Frankly in any country, there is a 
possibility of a parcel bomb being inserted onto an aircraft," he said.
Just last week British Airways chairman Martin Broughton said that some of the checks at British airports were 
"completely redundant" and called for authorities to relax checks on passengers.
"America does not do internally a lot of the things they demand that we do," he said. "We shouldn't stand for that."

WHAT a day for the global economy. In Britain, China and America, manufacturing surveys surged ahead, in every 
case beating consensus estimates and suggesting strong private sector growth over the next few months. 
Yesterday's jump in the global purchasing managers indices were undoubtedly the most bullish indicator I have 
seen in a long time.
The key here is world trade and globalisation: domestic demand in the UK and in the US may be weak, with more 
realistic credit, falling real incomes and sliding house prices - but the emerging world is booming like never before. 
One must hope that this can be sustained, helping to rebalance Western economies away from debt-fuelled public 
and private consumption and towards greater exports of goods and services.
Research from Ian Stewart of Deloitte confirms that the broader corporate recovery is also proceeding apace 
across the industrialised world. During the last month, 238 large companies from rich nations reported third quarter 
results. These include 214 from the S&P 500, 17 from the FTSE 350 and seven from the Euro Stoxx 50. Deloitte's 
analysis shows a strong rise in profits. Over the last year, earnings at S&P 500 firms reporting results in the third 
quarter have risen 41 per cent. Earnings at FTSE 350 firms rose 29 per cent. Euro Stoxx 600 index earnings rose 
31 per cent.
No fewer than 79 per cent of third quarter results exceeded expectations. As a result, the average earnings-
pershare analysts' estimate for the S&P 500 have risen 26 per cent. Those for the FTSE 350 are up 65 per cent 
and for the Euro Stoxx 50 by 18 per cent.
Technology firms are doing well. Even airlines are recovering: Ryanair posted strong earnings, BA is back in profit, 
while Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates US airlines earned record amounts in the third quarter (though the 
Private sector recovery still on track
impact of yesterday's new security measures in the UK remain to be seen). In contrast, US banks have reported a 
significant fall in revenues; the repossessions scandal will continue to drag them down.
There are three ways these buoyant profits will be spent globally: an increase in stock buybacks, higher dividends 
and more capital spending. The latter will help drive GDP growth and ensure that the squeeze on consumer and 
government demand won't tip the UK into a double-dip.
Tim Congdon, who runs International Monetary Research, is another economist who has become more optimistic. 
He argues that the latest money numbers from the US suggest that the case for another round of quantitative 
easing (QE) - which he thought was obvious for most of 2009 and early 2010 - is now far from clear-cut. QE's job is 
to increase the quantity of money in the hope that this boosts the demand for goods, services and assets. Yet 
Congdon notes that the M2 money measure has grown in the last three months at an annualised rate of 8 per cent, 
while the more important M3 measure is also creeping up.
If QE2 sees the Fed buy $500bn of long-dated Treasuries from nonbanks, this would expand the quantity of money 
directly by only 2 - 3 per cent maximum. We shall see - but it does seem strange that the US authorities are 
planning to jump on the QE2 just as some key indicators are improving of their own accord. Let us hope that, just as 
large chunks of the private sector start to recover, the authorities don't mess it all up again.

Ryanair 1H profits rise 17 pct as fares rise 12 pc

Ryanair said Monday its first-half net profit rose 17 percent to (EURO)451.9 million ($628 million) as the budget 
airline raised its ticket prices and grew its business in the Mediterranean.
The airline said its average fare rose 12 percent to (EURO)44 ($61) from the same April-September period a year 
ago as increased operations in Spain, Portugal and Malta paid off. The fare figure excludes Ryanair's industry-
leading practice of adding hefty extra charges for luggage and credit-card use.
Sales rose 23 percent to (EURO)2.18 billion ($3 billion), the number of passengers rose 10 percent to 40.1 million, 
and Ryanair's cash reserves rose 7.5 percent to (EURO)3.03 billion ($4.2 billion).
The airline cautioned that it expects to suffer net losses in the October-March period of (EURO)50 million to 
(EURO)70 million, reflecting reduced business on routes dependent on summer tourist traffic. Ryanair, which 
previously guided second-half losses of up to (EURO)100 million, tries to offset winter losses by shifting aircraft 
seasonally to operations in Spain.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair's earnings would have been even better if not for European 
authorities.
About 9,400 Ryanair flights were canceled in April and May because of European restrictions amid volcanic ash 
fears. More than 2,000 other Ryanair flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed this summer by air-traffic 
control strikes in France, Belgium and Spain.
O'Leary said the European Union must reform its laws permitting air-traffic controllers to strike. He said the 
controllers' unions and European governments should be required to pay compensation to stranded passengers, 
not airlines.
"These highly paid protected bureaucrats have now disrupted more passengers than the Icelandic volcano and still 
the EU sits idly by and does nothing," O'Leary said.
Ryanair 1H profits rise 17 pct as fares rise 12 pc
Ryanair also greatly reduced its total cost for spring's ash-related losses. The airline initially said it would lose 
(EURO)50 million from lost business and EU-ordered compensation payments to stranded customers, but on 
Monday said its total loss might not exceed (EURO)32 million. It attributed this to the airline's lower-than-expected 
payouts on customers' claims for hotel and meal bills.
O'Leary's deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, told Irish broadcasters RTE that Ryanair still expects to take over 
its Irish rival, Aer Lingus whenever the cash-strapped government drops its opposition to a merger.
"Our appetite for acquiring Aer Lingus is well known," Cawley said. "But we're not going to make another offer 
unless the government approaches us on a voluntary basis to offer their shares to us."
Ryanair immediately pounced on Aer Lingus when the government floated the national airline on the Irish and 
British stock markets in 2006. But other major shareholders, chiefly the government and employee-controlled trusts, 
refused Ryanair's offer, and European Union regulators in 2007 ruled that a merger would create an effective Irish 
monopoly in short-haul air travel.
Ryanair today retains a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus, while the government holds 25 percent. Last week Britain's 
Office of Fair Trading announced an investigation into whether Ryanair's status as the top shareholder influences 
Aer Lingus policies. Cawley said Ryanair is "puzzled and baffled" by the British investigation.

Ryanair said Monday its first-half net profit rose 17 percent to (EURO)451.9 million ($628 million) as the budget 
airline raised its ticket prices and grew its business in the Mediterranean.
But Ryanair shares fell as analysts expressed disappointment with the airline's profits from the summer, when 
customer demand is highest. Net profit in the July-September quarter was (EURO)313 million ($435 million), well 
below analysts' expectations of (EURO)350 million.
Ryanair shares fell (EURO)0.16, or 3.8 percent, to close at (EURO)3.97 on the Irish Stock Exchange. They had 
risen strongly in recent days in expectation that Ryanair which often talks down its outlook in advance of issuing 
earnings would beat expectations again.
The airline said its average fare rose 12 percent to (EURO)44 ($61) from the same April-September period a year 
ago as increased operations in Spain, Portugal and Malta paid off. The fare figure excludes Ryanair's industry-
leading practice of adding hefty extra charges for luggage and credit-card use.

Ryanair is due to fly out of Belfast for the last time today after a public inquiry into a proposed runway was further 
delayed.
Services to London Stansted and four other UK destinations are being axed.
The airline announced in August it was pulling out of George Best Belfast City Airport after a public inquiry into the 
plans, which it supports, was delayed.
Ryanair has been operating from the airport since 2007 on five routes - London Stansted, Bristol, East Midlands, 
Prestwick and Liverpool. Rival Flybe is starting services to Bristol, East Midlands and Liverpool. Ryanair flew about 
800,000 passengers last year to and from the airport. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said in August he was 
disappointed that the inquiry into the runway extension plans had still not gone ahead three years after Ryanair 
opened its Belfast City base. He said if planning permission was granted in the future, then Ryanair would come 
back. Mr O'Leary claimed in August that Ryanair's withdrawal could come at a cost of 1,000 jobs, either at the 
airport or in the local tourism industry. John Moore, from Northern Ireland's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
said the loss of Ryanair was a major blow. "It's a loss of revenue to the airport and probably a fairly extensive loss 
of jobs. "More importantly, to the service sector of the city of Belfast it's going to mean a big loss, especially at a 
time of economic recession." Belfast City Airport has wanted to build a runway extension for some time, which 
would have allowed Ryanair to fly to destinations further afield. The length of the runway currently at the airport 
limits the type of aircraft that can land there.

The ISEQ drifted lower again this morning as investors eye the US for signs of monetary easing and as Ryanair 
stocks fell.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 9.24 points to 2,675.01.
Investors were disappointed with Ryanair's half year results and guidance this morning. Ryanair says its net profits 
rose to E452m for the six months to the end of September - a 17pc increase from the same time last year. The 
airline also raised its guidance for its full-year performance. Half-yearly revenues rose by 23pc to E2.2 billion with 
passenger numbers up 10pc to 40.1 million passengers. Ancillary revenues grew by 22pc due to a combination of 
higher onboard spending, improved product mix and higher internet-related revenues. Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said the airline continues to gain market share across Europe from the big three carrier groups - 
Air France, BA and Lufthansa - despite the recessionary market. The airline had previously estimated the cost of 
the disruption caused by the Icelandic volcano in April and May at E50m. But today Ryanair said it now expects that 
cost to be E32m. It said it has refunded 100pc of the tickets on the cancelled flights and has processed over 90pc of 
the 'reasonable' expense claims for the disruption. Shares in the no-frills airline fell 15c to E3.98. Aer Lingus was 
down 3c to E1.12.
As part of the Irish retail sales figures for September released on October 29th, it was revealed that hardware, 
paints and glass volumes, seasonally adjusted, fell 10pc year-on-year. For Q3, volumes in the category were down 
6pc on Q3 2009. Retail sales in hardware, paints and glass can be considered a proxy for activity in the Irish DIY 
market. Grafton is market leader in this sector and Irish retail is expected to account for c.11pc of group revenues in 
2010 (and around 40pc of Irish revenues). Grafton's retail revenues fell 7pc in H1, an outcome similar to the 
hardware, paints and glass index, which fell 6pc. "Hence the index is a useful barometer for Grafton's retail 
operations. To this end, a decline of 6pc in Q3 is broadly consistent with our H2 forecast decline in retail of 5pc for

Grafton," said Davy Research. Shares in Grafton gained 1c to E3.08. The latest issue of The Grocer, the flagship 
publication in the UK grocery sector, reports a significant rise in retail bakery and chilled food prices in October 
compared with September. It notes that branded bakery prices are the highest since March and that the rise in 
chilled food prices follows the termination of September's price promotions in the category. Shares in Aryzta fell 40c 
to E31.05. AIB's new executive chairman David Hodgkinson has told shareholders that while AIB's problems are 
difficult, they can be overcome. He was speaking at an extraordinary general meeting to seek approval for the sale 
of AIB's 22pc holding in US lender M and T in order to raise about E1 billion. Mr Hodgkinson, a senior British 
banking figure, was appointed last Wednesday. Today, he expressed 'deep regret' to shareholders, many of whom 
have seen their savings destroyed as the stock has fallen from E23 to 34 cent. Shares in the bank rose 1c to E0.35

Ryanair has reported a 17pc increase in first half net profit and has upgraded its full-year earnings guidance, as 
expected, on the back of better winter yields.
The low cost airline now expects full-year net earnings to be in a range of 380 - 400m euros compared with 
previous guidance of 350 - 375m euros.
The rosier outlook comes on the heels of raised earnings expectations across the sector with leading flag carriers 
Lufthansa and Air France-KLM last week citing improving revenues and robust bookings.
Ryanair has exploited the recession to expand at the expense of higher-cost rivals in Europe and the group said 
consumers would continue to trade down. "We continue to gain market share across Europe," Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement. "We expect this trend to continue." Ryanair said this morning that its net profit 
for the six months to the end of September was 452m euros on the back of a 23pc increase in revenues. Analysts 
had expected a net profit of 441m euros. The airline has cut its estimate of the costs of refunding tickets on flights 
cancelled as a result of the Icelandic volcano to 32m euros from 50m. Most of Ryanair's growth comes from the 
continent and it is reducing capacity in recession-weary Ireland, blaming a tourist tax introduced last year as part of 
government austerity measures. "We have again cut our Dublin winter capacity by 15pc and have switched more 
aircraft to other European countries which have scrapped tourist taxes and cut airport charges," O'Leary said.

Ryanair Q2 Profit Rises - Quick Facts
Ryanair Q2 Profit Rises - Quick Facts
RTT News (United States)

Copyright 2010 RTT News All Rights Reserved
Length: 215 words
Body
(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported second-quarter profit attributable to equity holders, 
on IFRS basis, of EUR 330.3 million or 21.96 cents per share, up from EUR 250.5 million or 16.90 cents per share 
last year.
Pre-tax profit was EUR 377.9 million, higher than EUR 284.8 million in the prior year quarter.
Total operating revenues rose to EUR 1.28 billion from EUR 992.1 million in the same period last year.
Further, the company said its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains cautious as it has little visibility on 
Q4 yields. Based on Q3 forward bookings the company now anticipates that winter (H2) yields will be slightly better 
than previously forecast, therefore it expects the full year yield increase to be at the upper end of the +5% to +10% 
range previously guided, i.e. close to 10%.
Given these somewhat better winter yield forecasts, although with the usual caveats about limited Q4 visibility, 
Ryanair now believes that full year Net Profit will exceed the upper end of its previous forecast range of EUR 350 
million to EUR 375 million and will now finish (subject to Q4 yields) within a range of EUR 380 million to EUR 400 
million.

(RTTNews) - U.S. stock futures point to a higher open Monday morning, the first trading day of the week and the 
month, as traders brace for the outcome of major events in the unfolding week with optimism. The mid-term 
elections slated for Tuesday, FOMC meeting on Wednesday, where the central bank is widely expected to 
announce quantitative measures, and the jobs report for October slated for release on Friday will be the three major 
events that traders will focus on, in addition to economic data related to manufacturing index, auto sales, same 
store sales of retailers, personal consumption and personal income.
As at 6.15 a.m ET, the Dow futures were up 29.00 points, the S&P 500 futures were up 4.80 points, and the tech-
heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were up 8.00 points.
On the economic front, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its personal income & outlays report for 
September at 8.30 a.m. ET. Economists expect the report to reveal that personal income rose 0.5% and personal 
spending increased 0.4% in the month.
At 10.00 a.m. ET, the results of the manufacturing survey of the Institute for Supply Management, which are based 
on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide, will be released. Economists expect the index 
to show a reading of 54 for October, slightly lower than 54.4 reported for September.
The Commerce Department will release its report on construction spending for September at 10.00 a.m ET. 
Economists predict that construction spending increased 0.4% during the month, following an unexpected 0.4% 
increase in the month of August.
Earnings continue to be in traders' focus with a slew of earnings from major corporates slated for release during the 
course of the day.
Before the markets open for trading, Administaff (ASF), Alberto-Culver (ACV), Baker-Hughes (BHI), Corning (GLW), 
Humana (HUM), Loews Corp. (L) and Simon Properties (SPG) are among the major companies that will report their 
earnings results.
Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Comstock (CRK), Forest Oil (FST), Kindred Healthcare (KND), Leapfrog (LF), and 
Principal Financial (PFG) are among the major companies that will release their quarterly report cards after the 
markets close.
Stocks Poised To Open Higher
Earlier in the day, Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY) reported a rise in profit for the second quarter, as 
revenue increased 30% from the prior year, helped by higher passenger traffic and fares. The company also raised 
its annual profit forecast.
Traders will also react to the announcements made after the markets closed on Friday and during the course of the 
weekend.
Media giant News Corp. (NWS), on Saturday, said that its unit Fox Networks and Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) 
have reached an agreement in principle for a new distribution agreement that would provide programming from 
WNYW FOX5 and WWOR My9 in New York, WTXF FOX29 in Philadelphia, and the cable channels FOX Deportes, 
FOX Business Network, and Nat Geo WILD. Terms of the agreement, which would restore these channels to over 
three million households, were not disclosed.
British energy firm BG Group plc (BRGYY.PK) announced on Sunday that it will begin immediately the development 
and construction of the US$15 billion Queensland Curtis Liquefied Natural Gas project or QCLNG, near Gladstone 
in Australia's Queensland state. The company's single biggest investment will see the development of the world's 
first LNG plant fed by coal seam gas. The investment into the first phase of the project was finalized after it received 
the Australian Federal and State Government environmental approvals.
<b> Oil </b> Light sweet crude oil for December delivery is presently quoted at $81.99 a barrel, up $0.56 a barrel 
from its previous close of $81.43 a barrel in New York on Friday.
<b>Dollar </b>The US dollar is presently trading weaker against the pound following better than expected UK PMI 
manufacturing report. The dollar, however, is displaying choppy trading against the yen and the euro.
<b> World Markets </b>Most of the markets open for trading in Asia on Monday, except the market in Japan, ended 
in positive territory on optimism about the outcome of the elections in the US and possibility of quantitative easing 
measures from the Federal Reserve at the FOMC meeting during the middle of the week. The European markets 
are also trading in positive territory.

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) Monday reported a rise in profit for the second 
quarter, as revenue increased 30% from the prior year, helped by higher passenger traffic and fares. The company 
also raised its annual profit forecast.
For the second quarter, the Irish carrier's profit attributable to equityholders increased to EUR 330.3 million (about 
$461 million) or 21.96 euro cents per share from EUR 250.5 million or 16.90 euro cents per share in the previous 
year.
Excluding items related to the volcanic ash disruption to travel, profit attributable to equityholders was EUR 313.4 
million or 21.02 euro cents per share in 2010.
Pre-tax profit advanced to EUR 377.9 million from last year's EUR 284.8 million.
Revenues increased 30% to EUR 1.285 billion from last year's EUR 992.1 million, owing to a 17% increase in 
average fares, a 12% increase in passenger traffic, and a 21% increase in ancillary revenues. Total revenue per 
passenger increased 15% from last year.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased 31% to EUR 1.065 billion due to a 12% rise in passenger volumes and a 
17% increase in average fares. Load factor remained flat from last year at 88%.
Total operating expenses increased 31% to EUR 908.8 million due to a 52% increase in fuel costs and a 6% rise in 
unit costs as well as the higher level of activity and costs associated with the growth of the airline.
For the first half of the year, profit for the period attributable to equityholders of the parent grew to EUR 424 million 
or EUR 28.31 euro cents per share from EUR 373.5 million or EUR 25.21 euro cents per share in the previous year. 
The company attributed the increase to a 12% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by a 
44% increase in fuel costs.
Exceptional items totaled EUR 31.7 million pre tax in the just concluded half-year, reflecting the estimated costs 
relating to the closure of airspace in April and May due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions. In the year-ago 
period, exceptional items amounted to EUR 13.5 million reflecting an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding.
Excluding items, profit attributable to equityholders of the parent increased to EUR 451.9 million or EUR 30.38 euro 
cents per share from EUR 387 million or EUR 26.13 euro cents per share in the previous year.
Ryanair Q2 Profit Rises; Lifts Full-year View - Update
The company's pre-tax profit rose to EUR 482.5 million from last year's EUR 419.4 million. Excluding items, pre-tax 
profit advanced to EUR 514.2 million from EUR 432.9 million reported last year.
Revenues in the period rose 23% to EUR 2.182 billion from last year's EUR 1.767 billion due to increase in average 
fares, and a 10% increase in passenger numbers. Total revenue per passenger increased 12% as average fare per 
passenger increased 12% and ancillary revenues per passenger rose 11% from last year.
According to the company, average fares this summer rose 12% to EUR 44 in line with a 12% sector length 
increase. Unit costs increased 13% primarily due to growth in sector length and higher fuel costs.
Looking ahead, the company expects full year net profit to exceed the upper end of its previous forecast range of 
EUR 350 million to EUR 375 million and to finish within a range of EUR 380 million to EUR 400 million, subject to 
fourth-quarter yields. Still, the company said its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains cautious as "we 
have little visibility on Q4 yields."
Early this month, low-cost airline easyJet plc (EZJ) had said that it expects pre-tax profit for fiscal year 2010 to 
marginally exceed its earlier guidance range of GBP 100 million to GBP 150 million.
RYA.L closed Friday at 4.1320 pence, down 0.0670 pence, on 3.16 million shares.

Stocks Poised For Modest Gains After Personal Income Data - U.S. Commentary
Stocks Poised For Modest Gains After Personal Income Data - U.S.

(RTTNews) - Stock futures are pointing to modest gains Monday morning, as the markets are reacting to a mixed 
personal income and spending report in the U.S. and an unexpected jump in activity in China's manufacturing 
sector. The major index futures are all in positive territory, with the Dow futures up by 36 points.
Personal income in the U.S. unexpectedly showed a modest decrease in the month of September, according to a 
report released by the Commerce Department, with the report also showing a smaller than expected increase in 
personal spending.
Personal income edged down by 0.1 percent in September following a revised 0.4 percent increase in August. The 
drop came as a surprise to economists, who had expected income to rise by 0.2 percent compared to the 0.5 
percent increase originally reported for the previous month.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said that personal spending increased by 0.2 percent in September after 
rising by a revised 0.5 percent in the previous month. Economists had expected spending to increase by 0.4 
percent, matching the growth originally reported for August.
Earlier upside in the futures came as the markets looked to reports showing an unexpected pickup in Chinese 
manufacturing activity in October.
The Chinese purchasing managers' index released by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing for 
October rose to 54.7 from 53.8 in the preceding month, indicating the 20th straight month of expansion in the 
manufacturing sector.
A separate, private sector PMI measured by HSBC came in at 54.8 in October, rising from a reading of 52.9 in 
September.
Back in the U.S., data on national manufacturing activity will be released at 10:00 a.m. ET by the Institute for Supply 
Management. Economists expect the index to inch down to a reading of 54 for October from 54.4 recorded for 
September.
The Commerce Department will also release a separate report on construction spending for September at 10:00 
a.m. ET. Economists predict that construction spending fell by 0.7 percent during the month following an 
unexpected 0.4 percent increase in August.
Stocks Poised For Modest Gains After Personal Income Data - U.S. Commentary
As earnings season begins to wind down, Humana Inc. (HUM) reported third quarter net income of $2.32 per share, 
topping estimates. Total revenues grew to $8.42 billion from $7.72 billion in the same period last year but fell just 
short of forecasts for $8.46 billion. The company boosted its earnings guidance for the year but trimmed the higher 
end of its revenue forecast.
Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) said its third-quarter net income came in at $0.59 per share on revenues of $4.08 billion. 
Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $0.47 per share on revenues of $3.80 billion.
Earlier in the day, low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY) reported an increase in its profit for the second 
quarter, as revenue increased 30 percent from the prior year, helped by higher passenger traffic and fares. The 
company also raised its annual profit forecast.
In other corporate news, News Corp.'s (NWS) Fox Networks reached a new deal with Cablevision Systems Corp. 
(CVC) over the weekend for a new distribution agreement that will provide programming to a number of recently 
disputed markets including parts of New York and Philadelphia. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Stocks turned in a lackluster performance on Friday, as trading activity was subdued ahead of this week's expected 
quantitative easing announcement from the Federal Reserve, the results of the midterm elections and the Labor 
Department's monthly employment report.
While the S&P 500 slipped by less than one point to 1,183, the Dow rose 5 points to 11,119 and the Nasdaq inched 
up less than a point to 2,507.
For the week, the Nasdaq rose by 1.1 percent, while the Dow edged down by 0.1 percent and the S&P 500 showed 
almost no change.
Overseas, stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region ended mostly higher on Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index 
gained 2.4 percent and India's BSE 30 Index rose by 1.6 percent, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 Index 
bucked the uptrend, sliding by 0.5 percent.
Meanwhile, the major European markets are mixed. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is flat, while the German DAX 
Index is up by 0.1 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.3 percent.
Among currencies, the U.S. dollar has risen to $1.3930 against the euro, while it is flat at $1.6054 against the British 
pound. Against the yen, the dollar has slipped to 80.35 yen.
In commodities trading, crude oil prices are up by $0.70 at $82.13 a barrel and gold futures are up by $0.60 to 
$1,358.20 an ounce.

IRISH budget carrier Ryanair yesterday closed its Belfast City Airport base after saying delays to a new runway had 
stopped it launching new routes.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it was ceasing services to London and four other services to the UK from the Northern 
Ireland airport, switching its one Belfast City-based aircraft to another airport and axeing 50 jobs.
Ryanair, which only runs five routes to the UK because of the short runway at Belfast City, had planned to launch 
more routes from the airport to European destinations if the runway extension had gone ahead.
But it decided to pull out after an inquiry into the runway, initially due to open in 2008, was further delayed.
Ryanair, due to report half year results today, said the delay meant the extension may not open until 2012. The end 
of its services may reduce passengers by 1m a year, but it may return if the extension is built.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "It makes no sense for Ryanair to continue to invest in Belfast City, operating 
restricted routes with less than full payloads."

O'Leary's Aer Lingus shares come under the spotlight again
O'Leary's Aer Lingus shares come under the spotlight again

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary could have done without Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) choosing 
last Friday to rake over the coals of his aborted takeover of Aer Lingus.
For reasons largely related to EU law, the competition watchdog was unable before now to examine formally the 
implications for British consumers of O'Leary's pet project.
For O'Leary, however, it provided an unwelcome distraction for his shareholders when he would have preferred 
them to be concentrating on the airline's results for the half year to September, which are due to be published 
tomorrow.
The traditional diet for Ryanair investors - berating governments over tourist taxes and waste, berating aviation 
regulators for being ''useless'' and ''incompetent'', and berating other airlines for charging higher fares - will be 
supplemented this time by a subject not of O'Leary's choosing.
The Ryanair boss will - in public, at least - care little about the actions of one of the many governmental agencies he 
holds in low regard. But in theory, the OFT could make life awkward with a messy investigation that could, 
ultimately, force O'Leary to do something he does not want to do - sell his 29 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
While this is unlikely, he may be annoyed by the OFT reheating a pot that he would rather leave on the back burner. 
His shareholders may not welcome being reminded of an episode that could yet be seen as their chief executive's 
greatest - and most expensive - folly.
As of this weekend, Ryanair holds a stake in Aer Lingus that is valued at EUR 177 million. It spent EUR 350 million 
to acquire it. If it tried to convert this holding into cash, it would be almost certain to receive significantly less.
Four years after this stake was first assembled, all that Ryanair shareholders have to show for O'Leary's swoop is 
much controversy and two episodes of a story in which O'Leary, for once, did not get what he seemed to want.
O'Leary's Aer Lingus shares come under the spotlight again
They have received no dividends. They have gained no control over how Aer Lingus is run. They may have the 
satisfaction of knowing that their airline's major domestic competitor has been stuck in a strategic logjam for four 
years. But that appears to be it.
O'Leary has dismissed criticism over wasting his shareholders' money by saying it was a trivial sum for such a big 
airline as Ryanair.
However, if there are real benefits to Ryanair shareholders of his Aer Lingus investment, he has been slow to 
highlight them.
Last week, he called on the OFT ''to close these queries without delay, and without wasting time or resources on 
what is clearly a nonexistent issue''. But it would be unwise to throw stones at others for ''wasting time or 
resources''.
Or would it? In fighting his corner at EU level, O'Leary has successfully demonstrated that Ryanair has no influence 
over the management and control of Aer Lingus, despite being its biggest shareholder.
In addition, the EU investigations and court cases surrounding his Aer Lingus adventure have not dwelt on the 
possibility of forcing him to sell the stake, leaving him free to hold it to his own advantage.
The OFT intervention, however, opens up a new, intriguing possibility. As it has a different set of goalposts, the 
OFT may, in time, form a view that is less favourable to O'Leary than the EU's was.
If it takes the position that competition in the British market is affected by Ryanair being Aer Lingus's biggest 
shareholder, and that British consumers are suffering as a result, O'Leary may find himself wasting more time and 
resources on his smaller rival.
The OFT may indeed have a point. One concrete, though rarely mentioned, benefit to Ryanair of its Aer Lingus 
shareholding is its side effect of deterring any other airline from sniffing around the former state carrier.
While Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller has floated the possibility of the airline eventually finding a 
home as part of a bigger carrier - not Ryanair - he has failed to make a convincing case that any potential buyer 
would seriously consider trying to extricate Ryanair from the Aer Lingus shareholder register and supplant it with a 
knockout bid.
For O'Leary, there may be great satisfaction in knowing that he has effectively closed off the scenario in which he 
wakes up one morning and discovers that Aer Lingus, under the wing of a heavyweight international player such as 
British Airways, is about to transform itself into a heavy-hitting competitor.
He can also congratulate himself on ensuring that Easyjet - the rival he really cares about - has little interest in 
taking on the combined competitive force of Ryanair and Aer Lingus on Irish routes.
But these are achievements he cannot trumpet too loudly.
That would, after all, provide official recognition that his stake in Aer Lingus does indeed have value - but it is value 
that is derived principally from hindering competition. And that would undermine the argument that competition is 
not suffering, as he has no control over his rival.
So it may be easier, after all, to take the brickbats from time to time that come with assembling a large stake at 
great expense, only to see its value plummet, than highlight the anti-competitive nature of tying up Aer Lingus 
through his major shareholding.
It is not an argument that O'Leary would like to make.
Instead, he can deflect any lingering criticism from shareholders with the argument that the investment losses on 
the Aer Lingus episode have been written off long ago and that there is no further financial pain to be taken.
O'Leary's Aer Lingus shares come under the spotlight again
Unless, of course, a time should come when that stake would have to be liquidated for less than its current carrying 
value.
In the meantime, however, he would much rather be talking about his results.

The Takeover Panel is to address an anomaly in its rules which means a company and its directors can be 
presumed to be acting in concert with a major shareholder.
It is understood this issue has arisen a number of times recently given the small and concentrated nature of the 
Irish investment community.
If a shareholder owns 20 per cent of a company, the company and its directors and their families are deemed to be 
associated parties.
As a result, the directors and their families are limited in buying shares as this could trigger a mandatory takeover 
offer if the total shareholding tops 30 per cent.
Technically, Aer Lingus directors could be seen as operating in concert with major shareholder Ryanair because of 
this rule, even though Ryanair is not allied with Aer Lingus directors.
Merger and acquisition experts said that this has caused some problems, particularly in hostile situations, and that 
the onus was on the various parties to show they were not acting in concert.
The Takeover Panel will now consider a 'rebuttal' of the presumption that the shareholder and the company it has 
invested in, as well as its directors and their families, are acting in concert.
In its recently published annual report, the Takeover Panel said the presumption would not apply ''where it can be 
established that the directors are independent of the shareholding company''.
The accounts for the year to June, 2010 show that the Takeover Panel made a surplus of  165,000 in the period, 
compared with a def i c it of  123,860 in 2009.

Ryanair's 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is to be the subject of a preliminary competition investigation in the UK, 
more than four years after the budget airline took a stake in the carrier.
The unusual move by Britain's Office of Fair Trading drew a strident rejection from Ryanair of the legal case for any 
investigation.
Ryanair argued that subsequent decisions by European courts and the four-year time gap that had elapsed since it 
bought its stake in 2006 meant the OFT no longer had jurisdiction over the case.
The OFT said that it was investigating the 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, held by 
Ryanair.
The OFT investigation will first seek to ascertain whether it has jurisdiction over the matter, and if so, whether the 
Ryanair stake allows it to exercise "material influence" over Aer Lingus.
Ryanair first took a stake in Aer Lingus in October 2006 and subsequently launched a takeover bid for the carrier 
that was prohibited by the European Commission in 2007. However, the commission did not require Ryanair to 
divest its shares.
An appeal by Aer Lingus seeking to force Ryanair to divest its stake was rejected in July this year by the European 
General Court.
It was following this decision that the OFT decided to launch its inquiry into the Ryanair stake.
While Aer Lingus welcomed the OFT's decision, Ryanair said the delay and the decisions by both the commission 
and the court meant that the OFT no longer had jurisdiction in the case.
Ordinarily, the OFT must take action within four months of proposed merger activity, but this time limit can be frozen 
in the event that European-level investigations preclude separate investigations by the OFT.
Ryanair cries foul over OFT inquiry
Ryanair argued that this time limit expired four months after the commission's decision in 2007.
Shares in Ryanair closed down 6.4 cents at EUR4.13, and shares in Aer Lingus rose 0.1 cents to EUR1.15.

The Orange Tree, EasyJet headquarters, Luton Airport Food Cheap and cheerful Value for money Outstanding, 
especially compared with what you pay on an EasyJet flight
Corporate mission Low cost with care and convenience (or, Ryanair but nicer)
You know you are in the EasyJet canteen because a) you are at Luton airport; b) you are in a converted aircraft 
hangar, along with the rest of EasyJet's head office; and c) there is quite a lot of orange.
The budget airline's chirpy corporate colour covers the chairs, bits of the walls and several customers. The place is 
quiet on the day of my visit, where I am having a mid-morning meeting with some executives. But it heaves at 
breakfast and lunchtime, partly because the alternative is a packaged sandwich up the road in the airport terminal, 
and partly because it is sensationally cheap.
Coffee costs 90p, less than half what you pay on board EasyJet. However, you make it yourself at a machine and if 
I had to choose, I would go for the inflight option. Not so the food at The Orange Tree, which got its name in an 
employee vote. The menu varies by day and includes Noodle Tuesday, Omelette Wednesday and Fish and Chip 
Friday. The stir-fried noodles cost £3.75 and are cooked in front of you; omelettes are an even better deal at £2.40.
The chefs make an effort, too: "Katy Perry Peri" chicken appeared when tickets went on sale for the pop-themed 
Christmas party. There is a screened-off area with TV, sofas and table football, which is rather pleasant. For a no-
frills airline, it is not a bad deal at all.

Restorations are never to be undertaken lightly and once you have made the decision, it is wise to be aware of the 
importance of the property's location, writes Emma Mahony .
"If the situation changes," says Geoff Flynn of Montecastelli Restorations in Italy, "you need to be able to liquidate 
quickly. The better the location, the easier it is to shift."
The next priority is to choose a company to manage the restoration from start to finish, with a watertight contract, 
unless you can be on site daily. For your efforts, you may be rewarded with an architectural gem, otherwise out of 
your reach, which you have salvaged from ruin.

Britain investigates Ryanair stake in Aer Lingus
Britain investigates Ryanair stake in Aer Lingus

Ryanair's 4-year campaign to take over its Irish rival, Aer Lingus, faced a new challenge Friday from British 
regulators over whether its stockpile of Aer Lingus shares poses a risk to competition.
The Office of Fair Trading responsible for policing collusion between businesses in Britain said it's investigating how 
Ryanair's status as the largest Aer Lingus shareholder affects decisions on routes between Britain and Ireland, the 
major bases for both airlines.
Aer Lingus wants Ryanair to be forced to sell its 29.8 percent stake, while Ryanair is playing a waiting game in 
hopes that the cash-strapped Irish government will do a U-turn and offer to sell its own 25 percent stake in Aer 
Lingus.
Both Irish and European Union competition authorities have opposed a Ryanair takeover.
But EU authorities also have repeatedly rejected Aer Lingus appeals to force Ryanair to divest, most recently when 
the EU's second-highest judicial authority, the General Court, ruled that Ryanair exerted no control over Aer Lingus 
decisions. That July ruling also noted that national authorities in both Britain and Ireland remained free to hold their 
own competition probes.
The British agency said it would publish its conclusions Dec. 24 on whether Ryanair's minority stockholding means 
it "has the ability to exercise material influence over the commercial policy of Aer Lingus."
Aer Lingus welcomed the probe and pledged its full cooperation.
But Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary who earlier this month declared that a Ryanair takeover was 
inevitable given that Ireland "is broke" denounced it as pointless and illegal.
O'Leary said his lawyers have already told the London agency "to close these queries without delay, and without 
wasting time or resources on what is clearly a nonexistent issue over which the OFT clearly no longer has any 
jurisdiction."
Britain investigates Ryanair stake in Aer Lingus
He argued that, if the Office of Fair Trading had a genuine problem with Ryanair's takeover bid, its own powers 
required it to open an investigation within four months of the original 2006 takeover bid, not now.
But the OFT countered that its rules also allow for postponements pending the completion of European competition 
court cases.
Ryanair has thrived during Europe's recession, which has driven travelers increasingly to the airline's cheap tickets 
to secondary airports across the continent.
However, like most other European airlines, Aer Lingus has struggled with losses, in part because it has fought 
bruising battles to pare down its bloated and unionized work force. It also operates trans-Atlantic services to the 
United States that traditionally drive Aer Lingus profits but have turned loss-making in recent years.
Aer Lingus shares rose fractionally above (EURO)1.15, while Ryanair fell 0.6 percent to (EURO)4.17 in midday 
trade on the Irish Stock Exchange.

The ISEQ drifted lower again this morning with AIB shares falling to just 33c - close to the lowest ever - and as 
investors eye key US data due later.
By 12:30, the index had fallen by 16.58 points to 2,666.82.
Shares in AIB were down 4pc to E0.33, Bank of Ireland dropped 5c to E0.49 and Irish Life and Permanent was 
down 2c to E1.52.
The pace of the decline in lending to both the non-financial business sector and to households picked up again in 
September, latest figures from the Central Bank reveal. Lending to the non-financial corporate (NFC) sector 
declined by 3pc in the year ending September 2010, following an annual decline of 2.2pc in August, its Money and 
Banking Statistics bulletin for the month shows. Loan repayments by Ireland's businesses were E404 million greater 
than draw-downs during the month. The monthly net flow of loans to firms averaged minus E442 million in the three 
months ending September 2010, the Central Bank said. The annual rate of change in loans to households was 
minus 4.5pc in September 2010, following a revised decline of 4.2pc in August. In the US, Eagle Materials reported 
second quarter earnings per share of 22c, well below the consensus estimate of 26c. Revenues in the quarter (end-
September) were dollar 132m (consensus dollar 143.6m). Eagle manufactures and distributes cement, gypsum 
wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete and aggregates from 25 facilities across the US. Shares in CRH, the 
second biggest construction materials group there, fell 19c to E12.27. BA has reported a "steady improvement" in 
its interim results for the six months ended September 2010. Total revenue for the period was up 8.4pc. Passenger 
revenue was up 7.9pc on capacity down 6.2pc. Yields improved by 17.2pc (14.4pc excluding the impact of 
exchange), driven by price and mix across all cabins. The cargo business continues to deliver a strong 
performance, with revenue increasing by 39.4pc, driven by yields recovering from the market low point of last year 
as well as strong premium product performance and higher fuel surcharges. Cargo volumes, measured in cargo

£78m and £41m of pension costs. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E1.15 while Ryanair dropped 5c to E4.15. The 
UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has issued a statement on Ryanair's minority interest in Aer Lingus. C and C has 
announced that it is to shed 50 jobs at its Clonmel plant by the end of the year as part of cost-cutting measures in 
its reorganisation programme. A statement said: "The combined impact of a dramatically weakening consumer

Body
Britain's Office of Fair Trading has launched a merger investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus, 
prompting a scathing response from the low-cost airline.
The OFT said it was investigating whether Ryanair's near 30pc holding in its rival gave it the power to influence Aer 
Lingus's commercial policy and hampered competition.
Ryanair, which made its first failed bid to take over Aer Lingus in 2006, said the query was "out of time" and the 
OFT no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.
The airline said the European Commission and the European Courts had already ruled that it did not exert control 
over Aer Lingus. "We have asked our lawyers to liaise directly with the OFT to bring this out of time and 
unnecessary query to an early conclusion. Ryanair also calls on the OFT to close these queries without delay," 
chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. The European Commission prohibited Ryanair from trying to 
take over Aer Lingus in 2007. In July 2010, the European courts ruled that the EC did not have the ability to force 
Ryanair to divest its minority stake in Aer Lingus because it did not confer "decisive influence". "Given the 
termination of the European Commission investigation and related litigation, the OFT is now considering the 
acquisition," the OFT said in a statement. A decision in the probe is expected on December 24, 2010.

take over Aer Lingus in 2007. In July 2010, the European courts ruled that the EC did not have the ability to force 
Ryanair to divest its minority stake in Aer Lingus because it did not confer "decisive influence". "Given the 
termination of the European Commission investigation and related litigation, the OFT is now considering the 
acquisition," the OFT said in a statement. A decision in the probe is expected on December 24, 2010.

Britain's Office of Fair Trading has launched a merger investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus, 
prompting a scathing response from the low-cost airline.
The OFT said it was investigating whether Ryanair's near 30pc holding in its rival gave it the power to influence Aer 
Lingus's commercial policy and hampered competition.
Ryanair, which made its first failed bid to take over Aer Lingus in 2006, said the query was "out of time" and the 
OFT no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.
The airline said the European Commission and the European Courts had already ruled that it did not exert control 
over Aer Lingus. "We have asked our lawyers to liaise directly with the OFT to bring this out of time and 
unnecessary query to an early conclusion. Ryanair also calls on the OFT to close these queries without delay," 
chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. The European Commission prohibited Ryanair from trying to

(RTTNews) - UK Office of Fair Trading, Thursday said it has started a merger investigation into Ryanair Holdings 
plc's (RYAAY, RYA.L) acquisition of a minority shareholding in Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L). Ryanair currently 
owns 29.82% of Aer Lingus.
The investigation will consider whether Ryanair has the ability to exercise material influence over the commercial 
policy of Aer Lingus and also whether the acquisition raises competition issues that give rise to a duty to refer the 
acquisition to the Competition Commission under the 'substantial lessening of competition' test set out in the 
Enterprise Act 2002.
The OFT has written to Ryanair seeking information and its views on the acquisition. In line with its normal practice, 
the OFT has today invited comments from third parties on the acquisition, to be submitted by November 12.
Separately, Ryanair Holdings noted that the OFT is now legally out of time and no longer has jurisdiction. In 
addition, the company said both the EU Commission and the European Courts have already carried out detailed 
and extensive investigations into Ryanair's minority shareholding, and have conclusively ruled that Ryanair lacks 
influence or control over Aer Lingus.

Body
(RTTNews) - UK's Office of Fair Trading or OFT Friday announced an investigation primarily into the competition 
issues related to Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc's (RYAAY, RYA.L) acquisition of a minority shareholding 
in another Irish no-frills airline company Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L).
Aer Lingus welcomed the OFT's announcement, while Ryanair urged the OFT to close its queries, saying the 
department is now legally out of time and no longer has the jurisdiction to assess its minority stake in Aer Lingus. 
Ryanair currently owns 29.82% of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair acquired a minority stake in Aer Lingus in 2006. In October 2006, Ryanair announced a public bid for the 
entire shareholding in Aer Lingus. The European Commission investigated the bid and decided to prohibit it in June 
2007 on competition grounds.
The OFT stated that it will consider whether Ryanair has the ability to exercise material influence over the 
commercial policy of Aer Lingus. The department will also check whether the acquisition raises competition issues 
that require the interference of the Competition Commission.
The investigation will also check whether the OFT has the jurisdiction under the Enterprise Act 2002 to review the 
acquisition as a relevant merger situation, and whether the OFT is within the statutory time period to investigate the 
acquisition and to refer it to the Competition Commission if needed.
The OFT said it is currently considering the acquisition, given the termination of the European Commission's 
investigation on the acquisition and related litigation. The OFT has sought Ryanair's information and views on the 
acquisition, and invited comments from third parties on the acquisition, to be submitted by November 12.
Responding to the OFT's announcement, Aer Lingus said that it welcomes the announcement and will fully 
cooperate with the OFT in the investigation.
Meanwhile, Ryanair said that both the EU Commission and the European Courts have already carried out detailed 
investigations into the company's minority shareholding, and have ruled that Ryanair lacks influence or control over 
Aer Lingus.
According to Ryanair, the out of time query by the OFT into a failed 2006 merger offer between two non-UK 
companies sets an alarming precedent for all current and future mergers involving non UK companies.

Ryanair's Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said, "We have asked our lawyers to liaise directly with the OFT 
to bring this out of time and unnecessary query to an early conclusion. Ryanair also calls on the OFT to close these 
queries without delay, and without wasting time or resources on what is clearly a non-existent issue over which the 
OFT clearly no longer has any jurisdiction."
RYAAY closed Thursday's trading at $32.73.
On the LSE, RYA.L is trading at 4.1760 pence, down 0.0230 pence or 0.55%, on a volume of 1.19 million shares.
AERL.L dropped 0.0075 pence or 0.66% and is trading at 1.15 pence on the LSE, on 3 thousands shares.

(RTTNews) - Aer Lingus (AERL.L) welcomed the announcement by the Office of Fair Trading, or the OFT, that it 
intends to investigate Ryanair's (RYAAY, RYA.L) minority shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control 
legislation.
This investigation follows confirmation by the EU General Court in its decision earlier this year that, while the EU 
Merger Regulation does not give the EU Commission power to address such minority shareholdings, individual 
Member States remains free to apply their national competition law to Ryanair's shareholding.
Aer Lingus will cooperate in full with the OFT in this investigation.

Further strikes have disrupted rail and air transport in France this morning.
Flights in and out of French airports are being reduced by 30 to 50pc due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic 
controllers.
Ryanair has cancelled seven flights from Dubloin to and over France today, and a number of Aer Lingus flights are 
also expected to be affected.
A rolling strike by rail workers has halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed 
links. But broader protests over plans to raise the retirement age appear to be on their last legs a day after 
parliament adopted pension reform legislation. President Nicolas Sarkozy has refused to back down despite unions 
mounting wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months over his presidency's 
flagship reform. Today marks the seventh day of protests called by the unions over the plans to make people work 
two years longer for a pension, all but one of them since the start of September. Jean-Claude Mailly, head of the 
Force Ouvriere union, said the pension bill had yet to be signed onto the statute book but aknowledged that the 
protest movement was losing some of its previous punch. "This will leave deep scars," he said on France 2 TV, 
while acknowledging that the protest movement was starting to show "a little fatigue". More marches were 
programmed, including one in Paris this afternoon. A separate month-old strike at the port of Fos-Lavera near the 
southern city of Marseille may now become the government's main focus. It is starving many French refineries of 
crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of work stoppage. Sarkozy says 
the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning 
pension shortfall and safeguard the AAA credit rating that lets France service its debt at the lowest market rates.

Highlight: BA call for reform reflects frustration
Former US official hits out at Brussels
Body
A British Airways call to overhaul "redundant" airport security checks has sparked an outpouring of support from 
airlines, pilots and airports across Europe.
Martin Broughton, BA chairman, appears to have reflected pent-up industry frustration when he criticised some 
checks earlier this week , including those for shoes and laptops, and urged authorities to stop "kowtowing" to 
American demands for tougher checks on US-bound flights.
Geoff Williams, head of security at Gatwick, the UK's second largest airport, agreed: "It is unhelpful, confusing and 
wasteful if you go through one security process and then, if you are going to another destination, have to go through 
another. It doesn't make sense. If it's good enough for the UK, which has very high standards, it should be good 
enough for the rest of the world."
Olivier Jankovec, head of Airports Council International in Europe, which represents airports, said it was "clear that 
most of the recent developments in aviation security have been driven by the US", and it was time for a one-stop 
security system between the European Union and the US to stop "useless duplications".
BA's larger German rival, Lufthansa, and its UK competitor Virgin Atlantic both said they had been pushing for more 
efficient security processes for some time.
"We have said for many years that new technology is urgently needed to ensure that security checks in airports are 
effective but quicker and less intrusive on our passengers," said Virgin.
In Spain, Iberia, which is soon to merge with BA, said airline efforts to improve passenger experience were being 
"jeopardised by the strict security measures".
Airport security attack wins support
Budget airlines including Ireland's Ryanair also agreed it was time to move from what UK-based EasyJet described 
as "crude, blanket security checks which inconvenience all passengers to more intelligent processes".
One of the few voices of opposition came from the US, where Stewart Baker, former head of policy at the 
Department of Homeland Security under George W. Bush, said: "I don't know what he is talking about. I hope he 
does. I think it is incumbent on him to explain what he means. I am not aware of a double standard with respect to 
shoes or laptops or liquids."
European officials were at least in part responsible for the current inefficiencies he said. "The biggest problem that 
we have had is the almost irrational campaign waged by authorities in Brussels to keep the US from using airline 
reservation data to determine how much screening passengers should get . . . even though it would probably 
enable some of the streamlining that Mr Broughton evidently supports."
However, Jim McAuslan, head of the British Airline Pilots' Association, said the current "catch-all" system was 
especially frustrating for pilots, as it made "no differentiation between a captain of 20 years and a passenger who 
has just walked into the airport from the street".
The Board of Airlines Representatives, which represents 85 airlines operating in the UK, said it was not surprised 
by the industry's response.

Ryanair today said it is to cut 30pc of its flights to and from its Frankfurt/Hahn base, blaming the introduction of an 
E8 travel tax.
Ryanair's summer 2011 schedule will be cut from 11 to 8 based aircraft with 30pc fewer flights (from over 500 to 
less than 400 flights) each week, it said.
"As a direct result of Germany's new E8 tourist tax Frankfurt Hahn's traffic will decline by 1m passengers p.a. 
leading to the loss of 1,000 jobs in Hahn including 150 Ryanair pilots and cabin crew jobs. Ryanair will also close 
nine routes from Frankfurt Hahn to Agadir, Berlin (from 10thJan 2011), Gdansk, Gothenburg, Klagenfurt, Prague, 
Santiago, Seville and Wroclaw while 15 other routes will suffer reduced frequencies," Ryanair said.
"The German Govt's E8 tourist tax will do significant damage to traffic and tourism in Germany next year. In 
summer 2011 Ryanair will reduce our Frankfurt Hahn fleet from 11 to just 8 based aircraft. Flights will be cut by 
30pc, to less than 400 per week, with the loss of 1m passengers p.a. and 1,000 jobs at Frankfurt Hahn. 
International experience shows that tourist taxes have caused substantial traffic collapses in both Ireland and the 
UK this year and we believe that this ill advised E8 tourist tax will do similar damage to German tourism and jobs," 
said the airline's Michael Cawley.

"The German Govt's E8 tourist tax will do significant damage to traffic and tourism in Germany next year. In 
summer 2011 Ryanair will reduce our Frankfurt Hahn fleet from 11 to just 8 based aircraft. Flights will be cut by 
30pc, to less than 400 per week, with the loss of 1m passengers p.a. and 1,000 jobs at Frankfurt Hahn. 
International experience shows that tourist taxes have caused substantial traffic collapses in both Ireland and the 
UK this year and we believe that this ill advised E8 tourist tax will do similar damage to German tourism and jobs," 
said the airline's Michael Cawley.

Discount airline Ryanair says it will reduce its flights to a southwest German airport next year because of a new tax 
on aircraft travel.
The Dublin-based airline said Wednesday that it would reduce its flights from the Frankfurt-Hahn airport from 532 to 
382 starting summer 2011. It says the move could mean the loss of up to 1,000 jobs at the airport.
Germany plans to implement a graduated tax on flights, depending on the length of the route, starting in January. 
The airline says that its fare prices are low enough that even the low end of the tax (EURO)8 ($11) per passenger 
will represent a significant increase in ticket cost.

IT is a pity that ancient and beautiful Krakow is no longer the capital of Poland - sometime towards the 19th century 
Polish kings veered towards Warsaw for business but they always asked to return to Krakow for their final resting 
place, as did many famous Polish saints, poets and bishops. These days, Krakow is near enough fully renovated 
with all its ancient buildings restored with such beauty as to put many cities in Western Europe to shame.
As the autumn and winter months loom, Krakow is a quick and easy city break that won't blow your Christmas 
budget - Easyjet and Ryanair fly several times daily.
But our stay was certainly sweetened by our choice of accomodation: the Antique Apartments - very close to the 
ancient market square "rynek" right in the heart of the old town, with all the main attrac-tions only a short walk away. 
This is an opportunity to feel the grandeur of old Poland before the horrors of the two world wars.
This grand old building was once the home of Poland's high and mighty and it is now tastefully converted into a 
variety of apartments. Starting at (EURO)50 per night for two people in a one-bedroom apartment you get a nice 
lounge area, a fully equipped kitchenette, free wifi, a bedroom area and generously proportioned bathrooms.
All this located slap bang in the prettiest part of the old town, seconds away from all the action but quietly tucked 
away for a restful night's sleep.
The apartments are generously sized - for example a two-bed at (EURO)75 per night is advertised to sleep up to 6 
people and even the (EURO)50 one-bed can sleep four people. The range of rooms, from studios to fourbeds, 
makes it an ideal venue for a corporate team building event without upsetting the Finance Director's budget.
A home away from home in Poland 's loveliest city Antique Apartments made Neda Heath's stay in Krakow 
easy and comfortable
The design is something quite unique - modern and clean but tastefully honouring the history and character of the 
building.
We fondly remember the antique old-fashioned wrought iron lift that is now fully restored and functioning - it is a real 
treat to use it, though you have to remember to close the doors or the next person can't use it.
Another advantage of having an apartment is that you don't have to have the same-old hotel breakfast - instead you 
can experience the variety of cafes and restaurants for breakfast and brunch that serve delicious unsung Polish 
food for a very good price - two people can brunch in style for about £10-£15. You literally walk out of the building 
and there are lovely cafes and restaurants next door or across the road. It is extremely convenient, so even if it is 
cold or raining, the distances are very short, so you won't mind a threefive minute walk to get somewhere 
interesting or delicious and sometimes when you are lucky - both. From (EURO)50 per night for a one-bedroom flat.

At the Airport Operators Association conference in London, British Airways chairman Martin Broughton  had a 
cheerful dig at the (absent) Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary .
In Mr Broughton's telling, Mr O'Leary goes into a pub, asks for a pint of Guinness and is told by the barman that it 
will cost him £1.
"Just £1?" asks Mr O'Leary.
"Well, I'm a great fan of yours," says the barman.
So Mr O'Leary hands over £1 and the barman goes to pour the pint, when he stops and asks: "Would you be 
wanting a glass with that?"

Irish and international investors have gone cold on Irish stocks over the past couple of years, with nearly all of the 
Irish quoted companies, a swell as the stockbroking community, feeling the chill.
Brokers and advisers say that it is very difficult to sell Irish shares to local clients, while international investors are 
even slower to back stocks with exposure to this depressed economy.
Stocks with a wide geographical spread but trading on the Irish Stock Exchange, are also suffering from this 
aversion to Irish shares at the moment, according to some stockbrokers.
One broker said that, before 2008, Irish brokers' real strength was their knowledge of the Irish banks.
That expertise is now of little value.
CRH and Ryanair continue to be in demand from investors, but their operations are international in nature and are 
well covered by stockbrokers in London and further afield.
''From an Irish perspective, it's hard to get a foothold because they are so well covered.
How can you come up with something really original on Ryanair that will add value?
CRH used to be covered by about five houses outside Ireland. Now it is covered by over 30 analysts," said the 
Dublin based broker.
''The revenue from commissions for fund managers buying CRH has to be split among all those analysts, and it just 
dilutes what the Irish guys can make," he said.
The pure Irish plays, where Irish brokers have expertise, include the banks, Irish Life & Permanent, food companies 
and construction companies.
Brokers hit where it hurts as trading volumes sag
''The volumes are so light and liquidity is a problem, so it is difficult for us to make any money from them," he said.
Another broker said that when the Irish market was busy, the stockbroking houses would get around 20 basis points 
or 0.2 per cent of the value of each trade.
When the Iseq's total market capitalisation was  80 billion or  90 billion, there was plenty of income for everyone.
But now the market capitalisation is closer to  30 billion and trading is quiet, meaning that there is a lot less money 
to be made.
Now, a lot of investment funds are watching their own costs, so commission can be in the low double digits, 
meaning less income from those trades goes through.
The number of trades taking place on the bourse is now higher than it was in the boom year of 2007, but values are 
down dramatically.
From January to June 2010, the total number of trades was 1.1 million, compared with 695,000 in 2007. But in 
value terms ,that equated to  25.5 billion this year, compared with  101 billion three years earlier.
A private client adviser said that most Iseq shares were suffering from the Irish connection.
''The trouble is that anything associated with Ireland at the moment has a negativity about it, even if it's not 
accurate," he said.
''Some of these companies are driving ahead overseas and doing really well. People say, 'I'm not interested in 
buying Irish shares', although what they really mean is that they don't want to buy shares that are exposed to 
Ireland, which is a completely different thing altogether."
But there is no need for European and international funds to have a holding in the Iseq. One market source pointed 
out that the Iseq's market capitalisation is now comparable with Tesco's, highlighting how insignificant the exchange 
is in the context of global markets.
Brokers catering to the institutions were finding things particularly tough, said the private client adviser. ''If we are 
not buying AIB shares, our clients are buying Deutsche Bank, and that's fine for us.
On the private clients' side, we are very adaptable, but it is much more difficult on the institutional side, because 
their job is to sell the Iseq.
''If my client base never bought another Irish share for the rest of their lives but all stayed with me, I could still make 
a good living, but if you are reliant on the Irish stock exchange and business has fallen by 50 per cent, then you 
have a real problem," he said.
Irish shares have also suffered from the flight to companies with large capitalisations.
''Second-liners tend to be avoided because there just isn't enough liquidity to get in and out of there quickly," said 
one fund manager. ''Outside the top five stocks in Ireland, you are basically looking at a market of second-liners."
The big pension funds and institutions in Ireland had already been reducing their weighting in Irish shares on the 
introduction of the euro.
In the mid-to-late 1990s it wouldn't have been unusual for an Irish pension fund to have 35 per cent of its fund in 
Irish equities, but that was down to mid-single digits in 2007 - and is in the low single digits now.
The Irish economy's crash accelerated this shift, and some are wondering if the Iseq will ever recover.
''It's got very serious implications for the brokers around town," said the fund manager.
Brokers hit where it hurts as trading volumes sag
''Brokers will need to diversify their earnings stream and write more business in non-Irish equities.
That mostly is happening on the retail side." Some advisers are now focusing on their expertise in non-Irish shares. 
Among these is Davy, which is regularly producing research targeting its institutional clients, with reports on the 
likes of German sugar producer Sudzucker and Swiss cement giant Holcim.
But many agree that all the brokers cannot survive in this low trading environment. ''I would say the big issue now is 
that it is an over-brokered market, and you probably really need to see consolidation," said the fund manager. This 
is already happening in Britain, with Mena-RL having been sold to Daniel Stewart in February and Astaire's 
stockbroking unit sold to Sandfire Capital in recent weeks.
There were other deals last year, but there is plenty of activity in that market.
There has been some movement in this direction in Ireland, with Fexco's acquisition of Goodbody Stockbrokers.
The Financial Regulator will soon impose capital requirements on brokers, which may only serve to accelerate 
some further consolidation. It seems clear that investors will not come rushing back to the Iseq any time soon, 
which means that there may not be enough business for everyone for the foreseeable future.

What currency moves mean for your pension

The total amount invested in private pensions in Ireland stands at around  80 billion.
This covers both defined benefit (DB) schemes, defined contribution (DC) schemes and, increasingly, hybrid 
combinations of the two.
This is a very important pool of money.
The returns achieved must meet the requirements to fund pensions long into the future.
Performance of these funds is closely monitored by members, managers and the media.
But it is equally worth considering just where the returns come from, or to put it another way, where these assets 
are invested.
When we drill into the asset positions of a typical managed pension fund here, what really stands out is the global 
nature of the exposure.
Ten years ago, a mainstream Irish pension fund had a high percentage of its assets nominally facing inwards to the 
Irish economy.
At the start of 2000, for instance, Irish government bonds, Irish quoted equities and Irish property and forestry made 
up more than 40 per cent of a pension fund.
It is a very different picture today.
Irish government bonds, based on their weight in Eurozone indices, probably account for less than 1 per cent of a 
managed pension fund's exposure.
What currency moves mean for your pension
Companies quoted on the Irish stock exchange make up around 5 per cent of Irish pension fund exposure in 
aggregate.
Yet even this figure overstates dramatically the amount of exposure to Irish GDP.
Today the Irish stock market is dominated by companies such as CRH, Ryanair, and Kerry- companies which 
derive a huge proportion of their sales internationally.
Their prospects depend more on infrastructure spending in the US or the global demand for flavourings, rather than 
what's happening on the ground here in Ireland.
Stock broker estimates put the proportion of domestically generated earnings for quoted Irish companies in 2009 at 
more than 15 per cent.
On this basis the true exposure to the Irish economy for pension funds through their investment in Irish equities is 
less than 1 per cent.
Taking investments in government bonds and equities in total, the degree of domestic exposure of a typical Irish 
pension fund is less than 2 per cent.
Funds do have property exposure, the bulk of which is likely to be Irish, which would add perhaps another 3 per 
cent to the domestic content.
The bottom line is that less than 5 per cent of a typical Irish pension fund is now exposed to the Irish economy.
What this means is that, in the short term, as our growth rate lags other economies, pension funds have the 
opportunity to tap into better global growth. It also points to a very diversified basket that is not overexposed to what 
is, after all, a small open economy.
It also means that investors should have regard to not only how these international markets are doing but - at least 
equally importantly - how their currencies are faring against the euro.
Most traditional fund managers, unless they explicitly state otherwise, will be fully exposed to the currency of the 
market they are investing in.
So, for example, the returns from investing in Japan are made up of what the Nikkei will do and also how the 
Japanese yen performs.
Looking at the source of the returns achieved so far this year reveals how significant a role currency moves have 
played (see table).
In fact, global equities as a whole have delivered a return of more than 3 per cent so far this year in local terms.
Adding the currency impact drives this up to more than 8 per cent for a euro-based investor.
Returns in Japan have actually been negative this year, as the market has battled with political uncertainty, a 
sluggish domestic economy and an appreciating currency which hampers exports.
But that same appreciating currency has provided rich pickings for Euro-based investors in Japan this year and 
totally swamped the market return by delivering a positive outcome.
Moves in the US dollar have been even more dramatic, with the currency appreciating by 16 per cent in the period 
to early June and then losing by broadly the same amount in the period since then.
Again, the currencys wings have far outweighed what we have experienced in the stock markets themselves.
This is without the outbreak of ''currency wars'' as some fear.
What currency moves mean for your pension
Where the US dollar goes from here may impact on Irish pension fund returns as much as how the underlying 
companies in the S&P 500 perform.
As the then US Treasury Secretary , John Conally , said to a group of Europeans as the dollar weakened in the 
1970s, the dollar ''is our currency, but your problem''.
Irish pension funds clearly have a window on the world as far as future returns are concerned. Currency moves are 
an integral and very dynamic component of these returns.
While some may argue that in the longer term there is an element of ''swings and roundabouts'' in relative currency 
moves, there's little doubt that in the medium term they can have a significant impact on pension fund outcomes.
And 2010 is a case in point. Eugene Kiernan is Head of Investment Solutions at AIB Investment Managers. AIBIM 
is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. AIBIM is a member of the AIB Capital Markets Division

Michael O'Leary talks so much, it's hard to know when he is being serious and when he is staging a Ryanair self-
promotion campaign.
Because of that doubt, an interview that he gave to a German newspaper last week didn't really get the airplay that 
perhaps it deserved.
O'Leary told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that he still hoped to buy Aer Lingus.
He put it very bluntly when he said that the government would have to sell its stake in the airline because it needed 
the money.
He said something similar nearly two years ago, when he made his second bid for the airline.
He was right about them needing the money then, but wrong about them wanting to sell.
But if the exchequer needed the funds in December 2008, it really needs the cash now.
Based on last week's Aer Lingus share price, the airline had a market capitalisation of  600 million.
With Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller making some progress on cutting costs, the share price has 
actually climbed from a low of 50c last December to around  1.14.This values the government's 25 per cent stake at 
around  150million.
Given that we are borrowing around  400millionperweek,the  150 million might only last a little over two days.
But a lot has changed since the last Ryanair bid.
The government has initiated a review process in relation to state assets that could be sold off.
The INQUISITOR
If we end up selling a sizeable part of the Bord Gáis gas business for  1 billion, maybe a couple of ports and who 
knows what else, then flogging a stake in Aer Lingus seems pretty obvious.
Political sensitivities are no longer as big an issue.
A deeply unpopular government fighting off an IMF intervention should be able to sell the stake pretty easily without 
worrying about the backlash.
O'Leary's problem relates to competition rules. His last two bids were shot down by the EU, although technically 
Ryanair withdrew its offer before a formal rejection.
Perhaps the Ryanair chief executive believes that a government willing to sell its stake should free things up a little 
in Brussels and a formula could be found which would allow a deal to go ahead.
Ryanair owns 29 per cent of the former state airline. Its first offer for Aer Lingus, at  2.80 per share valued it at  1.4 
billion. His second, at  1.40 valued it at around  740 million.
This would have been a free takeover given that the company had cash on its balance sheet at the time of  700 
million.
A 15 per cent premium to last week's share price would value it at just under  700million. Its cash reserves are now 
reduced to about  300 million.
But last week O'Leary alluded to another possible upside to a buyout.
''We have no credibility in negotiations with Airbus.
They do not believe us that we really want to buy their planes. I think that will only change if we own an Airbus 
carrier, such as Aer Lingus," he said.
Perhaps O'Leary is not serious about a bid.
Perhaps he is just keeping the thought alive.
But look at it from the government's point of view. Is it really going to sell part of a major gas company and ports 
because it needs the money and yet hold onto a 25 per cent stake in a listed airline, which could be worth  150 
million to  180 million?
Should it want to sell, there are few buyers. It is not attractive to buy a stake of that size in a small airline with lots of 
problems, dependent on a shrinking economy, when the biggest shareholder is Ryanair.
O'Leary may be the only real show in town.
The issues are whether O'Leary is still serious about it and whether a formula could be found, this time with 
government backing, to get some kind of deal through Brussels.
There is a strong sense from the Ryanair chief executive that Aer Lingus remains unfinished business for him and 
he'd dearly love to bag it before he leaves.

Demand-based pricing adds twist to a new formula for eating out, writes Rose Jacobs
Body
Book a table, turn up, order, eat - then settle your bill: it's a tried and trusted formula at restaurants around the 
world. But in recent years, private supper clubs in London have turned the order upside down, asking diners to pay 
in advance for set meals - and now two Americans are trying to spread the idea.
Late this year or early next, Nick Kokonas and Grant Achatz - the men behind Alinea, a restaurant rated number 
seven in the world by Restaurant magazine - will open Next Restaurant in Chicago, a venture drawing on business 
models from industries as varied as aerospace and London's West End.
Like theatre goers booking seats, diners will buy tickets to meals rather than pay afterwards. And like Ryanair 
customers looking for cheap flights from Dublin to Malaga, they'll find better deals during less popular time slots - 
lower prices for the same dinner on Tuesday at 9.30pm than Friday at 7pm.
"I was a derivatives trader for 10 years," says Mr Kokonas. "Demand-based pricing seems to make a lot of sense to 
me."
Not that it's an entirely new idea: witness age-old early-bird specials. But the attention the Next Restaurant 
experiment has won in the US (with almost 10,000 people registering interest in a ticket), and the popularity of the 
private supper-club model in the UK, suggests diners are open to innovation that goes beyond cuisine.
The UK restaurant industry is embracing that - in part because it has to. During the recession, many chains relied 
on vouchers to maintain volumes, but at the expense of margins. Now, as they seek to wean customers off those 
deals, they need to find more creative ways of offering value. "Pricing is one of the hot topics in the restaurant 
industry these days," says Rafi Mohammed, author of The Art of Pricing .
Restaurant goers sign up to pre-paid dining experience
Groupon, a website that negotiates deals for users by leveraging group buying power, has convinced as many as 
1m Britons to pay for meals ahead of time.
The company persuades businesses to offer discounts of up to 50 per cent on the condition that a certain number 
of potential customers commit to the offer. Users pay Groupon up front and the company transfers that money to 
restaurants via an electronic "redemption tool". Les Trois Garçons in Shoreditch, the Supperclub in Notting Hill and 
Gordon Ramsay's US venues have all signed up.
This has raised eyebrows in the industry, where Groupon partnerships can be seen as a sign of weakness and a 
dubious route back to health, since you may be simply attracting low-profit dealhunters.
But Clarise Faria, who runs The Loft Project supper club in Hackney, east London, says pre-paying doesn't just 
serve as a vehicle for discounts and deals. It divorces the dining experience from the less pleasant experience of 
handing over money; it allows chefs to plan food costs, leading to less wastage; and it protects venues from 
cancellations. "We can't afford to have an empty table due to no shows," she says.
Mr Kokonas agrees: "If four people cancel at Alinea at the last minute, that's 5 per cent of our revenue for the day. 
Restaurant margins are narrow. You have two no-shows, and our day is shot."
Still, for all its advantages, some industry watchers are sceptical that the mini-trend of advance-pay will spread 
further. Robert Ancill, chief executive of the restaurant consultancy The Next Idea (no relation to Next Restaurant) 
points out that dining-out tends to be an impulse-driven activity and that customers want flexibility.
In Whitbread's restaurants division, meanwhile, pre-paying of a sort is happening by stealth - when corporate travel 
managers add breakfast or dinner to employees' Premier Inn hotel stays. That advance notice improves efficiency 
at the buying and staffing levels, according to Alan Parker, outgoing chief executive.
And if one UK group was well positioned to embrace the more radical dynamic pricing approach of Next Restaurant, 
it would be Whitbread - if only because Mr Parker's replacement, Andy Harrison, arrives after serving as chief 
executive at the master of the model, EasyJet.

At least 100 jobs are believed to be at risk at Shannon Aerospace, according to local TDs.
Fine Gael's Pat Breen raised concerns about these jobs in the Dail today that a major job cutting announcement will 
be made by the firm soon.
"Only last May Shannon Aerospace announced it was expanding its services after being given new design 
responsibilities. Yet just a few months later I understand that the company is due to announce the loss of hundreds 
of jobs at the facility," he said.
"The loss of so many jobs would be devastating to Shannon and the entire region. Almost 11,000 people are 
already on the live register in Co. Clare, which has been largely neglected by the current Government." "So it was 
deeply disappointing when the Taoiseach refused to answer questions on this crisis when I tried to raise it in the 
Dail today. Some 500 potential jobs were lost to Ireland when the Tanaiste refused to facilitate Ryanair in the 
Hangar 6 controversy. Now Co. Clare is obviously too far away for the Taoiseach to show any concern."

RYANAIR hopes the Irish government's financial woes will help the low-cost carrier finally seal a takeover of Aer 
Lingus, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told a German newspaper yesterday.
Ryanair, which owns almost 30 per cent of Aer Lingus, has tried twice to take over its rival but has struggled to 
overcome opposition from the Irish government which holds a quarter of Aer Lingus.
"The government is broke now, it has to sell its holdings. In the end, it will sell Aer Lingus as well," O'Leary said in 
an interview published in daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung yesterday.
Ireland said at the end of last month it could cost as much as (EURO)50bn (£44bn), or over (EURO)11,000 per 
head of a recession-weary population, to unwind years of reckless lending to developers during the "Celtic Tiger" 
boom.
"And I hope, we will buy [Aer Lingus]," O'Leary said, adding he would aim to expand Aer Lingus as quickly as 
possible following any deal.

The ISEQ sank in to negative territory this morning, failing to gain a lift from a general rise in Europe's markets on 
the back of strong US corporate results.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 7.13 points to 2,685.26.
European shares edged up today, with industrials gaining after forecast-beating results at bearings maker SKF and 
financials higher ahead of results from U.S. peers. But weaker oil and mining shares capped gains for key indexes. 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was up 0.1pc at 1,089.70 points, after hitting its highest 
close in nearly six months on Monday. The benchmark is up more nearly 69pc from a lifetime low of March, 2009, 
with fiscal stimulus having helped several major economies emerge from recession. However, it is up barely 4 
percent in 2010, partly due to worries about high debt levels among the euro zone's peripheral countries, notably 
Greece. SKF surged more than 10 percent as the world's biggest maker of bearings raised its financial targets after 
unveiling forecast-beating quarterly earnings and a USD1 billion U.S. acquisition. "Investors will accept the slowing 
in the rate of earnings recovery in the financials. I don't think there should be a huge surprise if we see some impact 
on the top line as long as margins are holding up," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB 
Stockbrokers in Dublin.
Banks in Dublin remained weak with AIB unmoved at E0.40, Bank of Ireland edged up 1c to E0.60 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was flat at E1.60. Shares in Ryanair fell 1c to E4.09 after Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said he hopes

its holdings. In the end, it will sell Aer Lingus as well," O'Leary said in an interview published in daily Frankfurter

over E11,000 per head of a recession-weary population, to unwind years of reckless lending to developers during 
the "Celtic Tiger" boom. "And I hope, we will buy (Aer Lingus)," O'Leary said, adding he would aim to expand Aer 
Lingus as quickly as possible following any deal. "We could, for instance, get access to Charles de Gaulle (airport in 
Paris) and compete with EasyJet," he said. Aer Lingus shares were flat at E1.11. Packaging Corporation of America 
(PCA), the fifth-largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products reported Q3 results broadly in line with 
expectations. Net revenues were 16pc higher year-on-year, driven by corrugated volumes up 4.3pc and external 
sales of containerboard which were 12pc higher. The remainder of the increase in revenues was driven by higher 
prices. Underlying earnings per share of 60c per share was 35c better than in Q3 2009 with a positive 37c per 
share from product price and mix. Shares in Smurfit Kappa fell 6c to E7.58. French company Rubis announced that 
it had acquired Shell's Southern Africa LPG business for E50m. No further financial details were divulged. On the 
same day, US-listed UGI announced that it had bought Shell's Polish LPG subsidiary. Terms of the transaction 
were not disclosed. "We suspect that DCC Energy is interested in Shell's UK LPG business. We believe that 
expansion in the UK is the focus for management in the near term; further expansion in the EU seems a more 
medium-term story," said Davy analyst, Caren Crowley. Shares in DCC dipped 3c to E20.72.

opposition from the government which holds a quarter of Aer Lingus. "The government is broke now, it has to sell 
its holdings. In the end, it will sell Aer Lingus as well," O'Leary said in an interview published in daily Frankfurter 
Allgemeine Zeitung today. The Government said at the end of last month it could cost as much as E50 billion, or 
over E11,000 per head of a recession-weary population, to unwind years of reckless lending to developers during 
the "Celtic Tiger" boom. "And I hope, we will buy (Aer Lingus)," O'Leary said, adding he would aim to expand Aer 
Lingus as quickly as possible following any deal. "We could, for instance, get access to Charles de Gaulle (airport in

(PCA), the fifth-largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products reported Q3 results broadly in line with 
expectations. Net revenues were 16pc higher year-on-year, driven by corrugated volumes up 4.3pc and external 
sales of containerboard which were 12pc higher. The remainder of the increase in revenues was driven by higher 
prices. Underlying earnings per share of 60c per share was 35c better than in Q3 2009 with a positive 37c per

The ISEQ sank in to negative territory this morning, failing to gain a lift from a general rise in Europe's markets on 
the back of strong US corporate results.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 7.13 points to 2,685.26.
European shares edged up today, with industrials gaining after forecast-beating results at bearings maker SKF and 
financials higher ahead of results from U.S. peers. But weaker oil and mining shares capped gains for key indexes. 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was up 0.1pc at 1,089.70 points, after hitting its highest 
close in nearly six months on Monday. The benchmark is up more nearly 69pc from a lifetime low of March, 2009, 
with fiscal stimulus having helped several major economies emerge from recession. However, it is up barely 4 
percent in 2010, partly due to worries about high debt levels among the euro zone's peripheral countries, notably 
Greece. SKF surged more than 10 percent as the world's biggest maker of bearings raised its financial targets after 
unveiling forecast-beating quarterly earnings and a USD1 billion U.S. acquisition. "Investors will accept the slowing 
in the rate of earnings recovery in the financials. I don't think there should be a huge surprise if we see some impact 
on the top line as long as margins are holding up," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB 
Stockbrokers in Dublin.
Banks in Dublin remained weak with AIB unmoved at E0.40, Bank of Ireland edged up 1c to E0.60 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was flat at E1.60. Shares in Ryanair fell 1c to E4.09 after Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said he hopes

Flights to France face delays and disruption due to the latest one day mass strike there against the pension reform 
plans of President Sarkozy.
Many flights into and out of the country have been cancelled because of the strike.
Aer Lingus has cancelled one return flight between Dublin to Charles de Gaulle aiport, but is hoping that all of its 
other flights to France will operate.
Ryanair has cancelled three return flights on its routes from Dublin to Nice and Rodez routes as well as one return 
flight between Knock and Reus. The low cost airline has had to cancel 200 flights in all across Europe today, 
prompting a claim by its chief executive Michael O'Leary that striking air traffic controllers don't care about 
consumers. He called again on the European Commission to end what he described as the "chaos" in Europe's 
airways. "If these people don't want to work, then replace them with military and other controllers who do wish to 
work," he said. Ryanair says that it has been forced to cancel 1,850 flights so far this year and delay more than 
12,000 others because of strikes and go slows by air traffic controllers in Europe. Fuel shortages are also beginning 
to hit flights in France, due to a week long strike by oil industry workers. The French aviation authority has told 
airlines to cancel half of their flights out of Paris Orly airport tomorrow, and almost one-third at other airports. Flights 
coming into the country have also been told to carry enough fuel for their return journey.

Ryanair hopes the Irish government's Budget woes will help the low-cost carrier finally seal a takeover of Aer 
Lingus, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told a German newspaper today.
Ryanair, which owns almost 30 percent of Aer Lingus, has tried twice to take over its rival but has struggled to 
overcome opposition from the government which holds a quarter of Aer Lingus.
"The government is broke now, it has to sell its holdings. In the end, it will sell Aer Lingus as well," O'Leary said in 
an interview published in daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today.
The Government said at the end of last month it could cost as much as 50 billion euros (43.9 billion pounds), or 
over 11,000 euros per head of a recession-weary population, to unwind years of reckless lending to developers 
during the "Celtic Tiger" boom. "And I hope, we will buy (Aer Lingus)," O'Leary said, adding he would aim to expand 
Aer Lingus as quickly as possible following any deal. "We could, for instance, get access to Charles de Gaulle 
(airport in Paris) and compete with EasyJet," he said. A takeover of Aer Lingus could also increase the likelihood 
that Ryanair started buying Airbus (EAD.PA) planes. "We have no credibility in negotiations with Airbus. They do 
not believe us that we really want to buy their planes. I think that will only change if we own an Airbus carrier such 
as Aer Lingus," O'Leary said. Ryanair's fleet currently comprises 202 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, according to its 
website. O'Leary said it was unlikely Ryanair would add Airbus planes to its fleet unless it bought Aer Lingus, which 
flies A330s and A320-family planes.

AVION CAPITAL BUYS LITHUANIAN SAAB OPERATOR
ACQUISITION Lithuanian-based airline UAB Avion Express has been purchased by newly formed aviation 
consultancy Avion Capital Partners and a group of investors. The carrier, formerly known as UAB Nordic Solutions 
Air Services, operates a fleet of four Saab 340s - three of which are cargo aircraft. It was acquired by Avion Aircraft 
Trading in 2007 and rebranded. Avion Capital Partners, which has been formed by former Avion Aircraft Trading 
executives, has a long-term plan to develop the airline as a wet-lease specialist.
ATLANT-SOYUZ KNOWS WHERE IT COMES FROM
BRANDING Moscow's city government-controlled carrier Atlant-Soyuz has adopted the new name Moskva Airlines 
to underscore its affiliation with the city. A new livery will follow "in due course".
LOCKHEED MARTIN SELL-OFF AVERTS CONFLICT
DIVESTMENT Lockheed Martin is to sell its Enterprise Integration Group business to Veritas Capital for $815 
million in cash. The divestment comes in response to US government concerns about perceived organisational 
conflicts of interest. EIG provides system engineering services, architecture and integration services and support to 
a broad range of government customers. Divesting the business better positions it for growth, says Lockheed 
Martin.
THAI CARRIER PICKS AJ WALTER FOR 767 SERVICES
MAINTENANCE Thai carrier Business Air has signed a three-year agreement with AJ Walter Aviation for power-by-
the-hour maintenance support for its Boeing 767-300 fleet. The agreement will supplement the full daily support that 
AJW is providing to the airline's three aircraft since its start-up in December 2009. Business Air serves the Far East 
and Middle East.
AER ARANN HOPEFUL AS INVESTORS SIGN UP
INTRODUCTION:
AIRLINES Aer Arann has signed a preliminary agreement with investors that could help the struggling Irish regional 
carrier to exit creditor protection. Aer Arann has been under examinership - the Irish equivalent of bankruptcy 
protection - since August and has been seeking investment to enable it to emerge before the end of the year. Aer 
Arann's examiner Michael McAteer has told the Irish high court that with the new investment the carrier "has a 
reasonable prospect of survival as a going concern".
RYANAIR LEAVES MARSEILLES OVER TAX WRANGLE
REGULATION Ryanair is to close its Marseilles base - its only one in France - following a legal challenge from 
French authorities that want the Irish carrier to pay French income and social insurance taxes on its 200 Marseilles-
based workers. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, however, says that under European Union rules "these are not 
French jobs, but rather Irish jobs on Irish aircraft, which are defined by EU regulations as Irish territory". The aircraft 
at Marseilles will be moved to airports in Spain, Italy and Lithuania. It will continue to serve Marseilles from bases 
elsewhere in Europe.
EMBRAER'S THIRD-QUARTER DELIVERIES FALL
MANUFACTURING Embraer delivered 44 jets - 20 to commercial airlines and 24 to business jet operators - during 
the third quarter, compared with 57 during the same period in 2009. For the year through September, Embraer 
topped its 2009 delivery total by one unit, at 154 aircraft: 70 commercial jets, 83 business jets and one Legacy 600 
to the defence market.

The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 2.11 points ahead a short time ago at 2,694.50.

Before Ryanair came on the scene and Irish families starting popping over to Spain during every mid-term break, 
holidays in Ireland were the highlight of the year for many children.
Despite the weather, many people have very fond memories of childhoods spent in Kerry, Wexford or Donegal, 
which will never be eclipsed by more recent holidays in the sun.
With this in mind - and the financial realities of the recession making themselves felt - a holiday in Ireland seemed 
to be the best option for an autumn break with our soon-to-be two yearold.
And where better to go than the west of Ireland, where I had spent most of my childhood holidays?
With ten days at our disposal, we headed for Cong, Co Mayo, best known to most people as the location for The 
Quiet Man, starring Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne.
The motorway between Dublin to Galway now makes it a very short trip, although there was a detour to Moran's of 
the Weir in Clarinbridge for some good oysters and a bowl of soup.
Cong is magical place, not least because of its proximity to the medieval luxury of Ashford Castle.
But, this being a family trip, we decided to go mainly for budget accommodation, with a couple of luxury nights 
thrown in.
Instead of the castle, we stayed in Ryan's Hotel on Cong's main street, a very reasonably-priced, basic hotel, with 
the added advantage of good pub food and helpful staff.
Ryan's is owned by Denis Lenihan and Mike Crowe, previously executive and head chef, respectively, at Ashford 
Castle, and it proved to be a great base from which to explore Connemara.
High times in the wild west
We may not have been guests at the castle, but the grounds provided hours of fun for the toddler, who got endless 
enjoyment out of the ruins of the abbey at its back entrance.
A highlight was loved the forest strolls, including one which leads to the Monk's Fishing House, a small building 
suspended over the river with a narrow slit in the ground.
The story goes that the monks caught fish through the hole and a bell attached to the abbey alerted them that the 
evening's dinner had been caught.
Back in Cong, we were pleased to see that Pat Cohan's Bar, which featured in the Quiet Man, is now actually a bar. 
For decades, former owner Jack Murphy had maintained it as a gift shop, while keeping the bar sign from the film 
set over the door. It confused countless foreign tourists, but now it means what it says above the door.
After a few nights in Cong, we upped sticks and headed northwards to Westport for an evening.
There we enjoyed the luxury of the Westport Plaza hotel, a totally child-friendly destination where the youngest 
member of our party was presented with a colouring book and crayons on arrival.
While my husband and son had a fantastic time in the pool at the leisure centre, I enjoyed possibly the best facial I 
have ever had in the hotel's Spa Sula.
Nearby Westport House and Gardens is another familyfriendly destination, despite the fact we were in the grounds 
of a stunning great house.
The little guy enjoyed the indoor play area, which is a padded climbing zone for youngsters.
The site of Westport House was once home to pirate queen Grace O'Malley, and there is a pirate themed 
adventure park on the grounds, with what look like some stomach turning rides.
It was not open during our visit but will open for the upcoming mid-term break. Several events are planned for 
Hallowe'en, including fireworks and a dungeon disco.
There is a campsite on the grounds for interested visitors, and other attractions include the Swan pedal boats and a 
miniature train.
After our brief visit to Westport, it was back down to Clifden for a spell of self catering in Ardagh Lodge, which can 
take groups of up to ten people. I'll declare an interest here, as it's owned by my brother-in-law, but it was ideal 
family accommodation with a wonderful kitchen and dining table for great group meals.
Built in the 1820s, the house has all the modern conveniences and manages to be minimalist but very cosy and 
welcoming.
It is well-accustomed to wellies and children, so we were happy to let our son run around and explore without fear 
of damage to him or the house. Visitors can also avail of sea trout fishing on the lodge's river and lake.
There is plenty of nature to be enjoyed around the house, and the Connemara National Park is just a few miles 
away.
A totally cost-free option, its playground was a huge hit with our son.
He also enjoyed the nature walk, which involved a lot of steps.
The wild flowers, streams, waterfalls trees and plants were all fascinating to a child.
There is also a lovely cafe and, in the park, outdoor tables and an exhibition, making the park a must-see during 
any Clifden visit.
High times in the wild west
Heading out Ballyconneely Road towards Roundstone, we discovered several beautiful little beaches which 
provided plenty of entertainment.
Roundstone is a lovely little harbour village and O'Dowd's pub and restaurant is a great spot for food, attracting 
crowds of visitors during the summer months.
The only thing we noted here - and in many other spots in the west - was that prices for food don't seem to have 
adjusted on the back of the recession.
After a few great days in Clifden, some luxury awaited in Galway in the five-star G Hotel.
This is just outside the city and the influence of hat designer Philip Treacy, who designed the interiors, is evident 
from the minute you walk in the door.
The high-style concept doesn't sit well with the demands of a boisterous 22month-old, but the staff weren't in the 
slightest bit phased by a curious toddler - and there were plenty of young children in residence.
We also ordered a very expensive plate of beans on toast for Tom, which was a reminder that, while there are great 
room rates on offer, five-star hotels still charge five-star prices when they get you in the door.
But the beds were most certainly luxurious, as was the lovely cot organised by the hotel.
There's no shortage of activities in Galway, and we chose to visit the Galway Atlantaquaria in Salthill.
Our son had already attempted to trap a few fish in his net in Cong, but he met his match in the aquarium with some 
of the larger specimens. We will no doubt return as his fascination with fish grows.
Our trip to the west finished with a fantastic breakfast in the G: delicious pancakes for me and a very tasty fry for my 
husband.
After the Rice Krispies were demolished by our fellow traveller, it was time to get on the road to reality.
But we decided a couple's break was on the cards - and a brief return to Galway is in the diary for December.
Getting There
Getting there: you'll need a car to properly explore the west of Ireland, although you can take the train to Galway 
(www.irishrail.ie) or the bus to any of the major towns, including Cong, Westport and Clifden (           
www.buseireann.ie)
Where to stay: Ryan's Hotel, Cong, Co Mayo (www.ryanshotelcong.ie, 094-9546243); Westport Plaza Hotel, 
Westport (www.westportplazahote l.ie; 098-51166); Westport House and Gardens, Co Mayo (098-27766); Ardagh 
Lodge, Galway (tim.morris@windmilllane com); G Hotel, Galway (           www.theghotel.ie, 091865200)
What to buy: great Irish knits in the craft shops across the west. They're probably available all over Ireland, but you 
would never wander into a craft shop in your home town
What to avoid: overpriced food. Due to a lack of competition, many restaurants are still charging pre-recession 
prices Useful websites: mykidstime.ie; clifden.ie; gal way.net

Body
Profit taking after the week's modest rally sent the ISEQ lower this morning despite a surge in Europe's shares 
indices to five-month highs.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 13.35 points to 2,715.71.
European shares hit their highest in more than five months today, boosted by hopes of more monetary easing in the 
United States, a robust earnings season, and with miners higher on stronger metals prices. However, a weaker 
banking sector capped gains for key indexes.
Banks were weak in Dublin too with AIB flat at E0.43, Bank of Ireland unmoved at E0.65 and Irish Life and 
Permanent down 2c to E1.58. APN has announced the appointment of Brett Chenoweth as CEO to replace the 
incumbent Brendan Hopkins who announced his intention to retire earlier this year. In addition, the statement 
announces the retirement of Donal Buggy and Cameron O'Reilly from the APN Board. As a result, Independent 
News and Media's control of the APN Board will fall below 50pc and the group must fully deconsolidate APN from 
its accounts. Shares in the Irish media group rose 1c to E0.64. Ryanair has announced that it will move out of its 
French base; Court of Appeal rules in favour of Competition Commission decision that some BAA-owned airports 
should be sold. "We believe that the power in the supply chain regarding airports remains with the few airlines 
which are growing and can offer traffic - that means, in the main, Ryanair," said Davy Research. Ryanair's shares 
fell 4c to E4.08. Aer Lingus released a trading update ahead of its interim management statement on November 
5th. Trading in Q3, and September in particular, has been stronger than expected, primarily as a result of improved 
yields (with growth in line with Q2 2010). Forward revenues suggest that October and November will also be ahead 
of expectations. "This is the second positive trading statement in the last six months and affirms the positive trend 
seen in the traffic statistics. Thus, barring any once-off events, we believe the company's guidance is attainable," 
said Davy. Aer Lingus shares fell 3c to E1.11.

European shares hit their highest in more than five months on Thursday, boosted by hopes of more monetary 
easing in the United States, a robust earnings season, and with miners higher on stronger metals prices. However, 
a weaker banking sector capped gains for key indexes. U.S. stocks were little changed, but bank stocks fell on 
concerns over a nationwide probe into the mortgage industry.
Banks were weak in Dublin too with AIB flat at E0.43, Bank of Ireland was down 3c at E0.62 and Irish Life and 
Permanent down 4c to E1.56. APN has announced the appointment of Brett Chenoweth as CEO to replace the 
incumbent Brendan Hopkins who announced his intention to retire earlier this year. In addition, the statement 
announces the retirement of Donal Buggy and Cameron O'Reilly from the APN Board. As a result, Independent 
News and Media's control of the APN Board will fall below 50pc and the group must fully deconsolidate APN from 
its accounts. Shares in the Irish media group rose 1c to E0.64. Ryanair has announced that it will move out of its 
French base; Court of Appeal rules in favour of Competition Commission decision that some BAA-owned airports 
should be sold. "We believe that the power in the supply chain regarding airports remains with the few airlines 
which are growing and can offer traffic - that means, in the main, Ryanair," said Davy Research. Ryanair's shares 
fell 6c to E4.07. Aer Lingus released a trading update ahead of its interim management statement on November 
5th. Trading in Q3, and September in particular, has been stronger than expected, primarily as a result of improved 
yields (with growth in line with Q2 2010). Forward revenues suggest that October and November will also be ahead 
of expectations. "This is the second positive trading statement in the last six months and affirms the positive trend 
seen in the traffic statistics. Thus, barring any once-off events, we believe the company's guidance is attainable," 
ISEQ falls back below the 2,700 mark ISEQ Falls
said Davy. Aer Lingus shares fell 3c to E1.11. The latest data from the Builders Merchants Federation shows that 
UK merchanting volumes grew by 3.4pc in August, which leaves volumes down 1pc over the last three months, a 
reflection of a relatively weak July. However, this has not been reflected in the national players, with Travis Perkins 
recently reporting like for like growth in merchanting of over 10pc in Q3, while Grafton reported sales of +6pc in 
July. "So it looks like the national players are taking share, which could be a function of working capital dynamics," 
said Goodbody's. Shares in Grafton rose 7c to E3.26. DCC announced that it has completed the acquisition of 
Comtrade, a leading distributor of consumer electronic products to the French retail sector, first announced on 
August 23. For calendar year 2009, Comtrade generated revenue of E65.2m and E3m in operating profit. Initial 
consideration of E11.4m will be paid in cash for a 74pc stake, rising to a maximum of E21.2m for the remaining 
interest over the next three years, presumably based on certain profit targets being met. DCC's shares were flat at 
E20.80.

BAA to sell two airports after losing court ruling AVIATION

Body
AIRPORT operator BAA is set to take its battle with the Competition Commission to the Supreme Court, after the 
regulator won a High Court ruling forcing it to sell off two more airports to satisfy competition concerns in the 
industry.
BAA's Spanish owner Ferrovial will now have to sell off Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports, a year 
after offloading Gatwick to the Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) consortium for £1.51bn.
The news comes as the latest development in a long tussle between the firm and the Competition Commission, 
which produced its original report into BAA's dominance of the UK's major airports in March last year, 
recommending the sale of two more airports in addition to Gatwick.
BAA took the case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), where its appeal was upheld on the grounds of 
"apparent bias" in the original report. The airport operator argued successfully that a member of the Commission's 
advisory panel, Professor Peter Moizer, was potentially compromised, as he also acted as an adviser to the 
pension fund which owns Manchester Airport Group, a possible bidder for BAA's assets.
But the appeal was overturned yesterday by Lord Justice Maurice Kay, who agreed with the Commission that 
Moizer's connection was too remote to have materially influenced the outcome of the report.
BAA said it was "disappointed" by the decision and would seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. Charles 
Stanley aviation analyst Douglas McNeill said the decision would be broadly welcomed by the airlines operating out 
of BAA's airports.

"There is a desire to see BAA's dominance challenged, though many would argue that regulatory changes need to 
be introduced as well in order to prevent a national monopoly being replaced by several regional monopolies," he 
said. "But by and large the airlines would welcome increased competition, as airport charges are such a large part 
of the cost base."
Ryanair, which has slimmed down its operations at Stansted drastically in recent years, supported the Competition 
Commission in its case.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the Court of Appeal ruling was "a great result for competition, consumer 
choice and passengers".

Body
The fate of three of the country's largest airports is likely to be unresolved for at least another month as BAA 
prepares to fight a new ruling in its longrunning fight with competition authorities.
The UK's biggest airport operator suffered a blow on Wednesday when the Court of Appeal restored last year's 
Competition Commission order for it to sell Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports, because the 
company's near-monopoly was harming passengers' interests .
BAA, which also owns Heathrow airport, immediately said it would seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, 
which it must do within 28 days.
That could buy it more time ahead of any eventual sale of the airports, most of which have suffered declining traffic 
since the original Competition Commission order in March 2009.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive and a veteran opponent of BAA's dominance of the airports, urged the 
company to accept a ruling he described as "a great result for -competition".
But BAA lost £277m when it sold Gatwick airport for £1.51bn last year, having put it up for sale ahead of the 
commission's expected break-up order, and is eager to avoid further losses in the event of future sales.
The commission's order was overturned in February after BAA, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, successfully 
argued that the watchdog's investigation suffered from an appearance of bias.
On Wednesday a three- judge Court of Appeal panel led by Lord Justice Kay ruled that the commission's BAA 
investigation team did not suffer from such bias, even though one of its members, Professor Peter Moizer, was also 
an adviser to a pension fund linked to Manchester Airport Group, a potential buyer of BAA assets.
The Court of Appeal said Prof Moizer was "too remote" from the Manchester company during the crucial phase of 
the investigation for the question of bias to have arisen.
BAA set to fight latest airports sale ruling
"We are disappointed that the Court of Appeal has upheld two of the five grounds argued by the Competition 
Commission," BAA said in a statement. "We note the court's view that apparent bias in relation to a panel member 
existed during part of the commission's investigation and will study this judgment carefully."
The commission welcomed the ruling, adding it had tightened its internal conflict-of-interest procedures, including 
ordering an independent review of them, as the result of the court case.

Irish shares edged ahead in early trade this morning, extending yesterday's modest gains.
The ISEQ index was 9.06 points ahead a short time ago at 2,738.12.
The limited upward trend mirrors gains on markets around the world, as expectations rage of more money printing 
by the Fed in the US.
Although this is seen as likely to increase demand, it is also hurting the dollar, with a resulting rise in the euro hitting 
Irish exporters. CRH and Elan, both of which have major exposure in the US, were up this morning. CRH is 5c 
ahead at 1230, with Elan up 4c to 438. Food companies continue to do well, with Kerry Goup up 8c to 2566 and 
Glanbia lifting by 5c to 355. Aer Lingus is down 2c after the airline warned that bookings over the winetr are not 
looking good. However, Ryanair is up 2c to 414.

The ISEQ made steady headway today on the back of a general global rally in equities on growing hopes of a new 
shot-in-the-arm for the American economy.
The index rose 19.61 points to 2,729.06.
World stocks hit a five-month high today driven by expectations of more money printing in the United States and 
upbeat corporate reports. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting showed officials discussed the 
possibility of buying more longer-term U.S. government debt to drive borrowing costs lower and ways to nudge the 
public into expecting higher levels of inflation in the future to spur spending. U.S. technology firm Intel's upbeat 
fourth-quarter sales and margins forecast raised hopes that the technology sector could end 2010 on a strong note. 
The prospect of more cheap money and expectations that corporate earnings would improve further encouraged 
investors to buy risky assets such as equities while pushing the dollar towards an eight-month low against the euro. 
"We saw from the FOMC minutes that there is little doubt that a further round of (quantitative easing) is likely to 
happen at the next meeting," David Morrison, market strategist at GFT Global said.
Aer Lingus was in focus at home with the stock down 3c to E1.12 despite a statement today that painted a rosy 
picture of trading in the past two months. It said that trading in the third quarter, and in the month of September in 
particular, has been stronger than expected. It said that the better results were down to improved yields with growth 
in line with the second quarter of 2010. Predicted revenues for October and for November indicate that the 
performance will also be ahead of expectations, it said. "At this time, forward revenues indicate that December and 
the first quarter of 2011 appear much weaker than anticipated, however, the Group is not yet able to determine 
whether this reflects the recent trend towards later bookings or an underlying softness in demand," a statement

The ISEQ made steady headway this morning on the back of a general global rally in equities on growing hopes of 
a new shot-in-the-arm for the American economy.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 17.33 points to 2,726.78.
World stocks hit a five-month high today driven by expectations of more money printing in the United States and 
upbeat corporate reports. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting showed officials discussed the 
possibility of buying more longer-term U.S. government debt to drive borrowing costs lower and ways to nudge the 
public into expecting higher levels of inflation in the future to spur spending. U.S. technology firm Intel's upbeat 
fourth-quarter sales and margins forecast raised hopes that the technology sector could end 2010 on a strong note. 
The prospect of more cheap money and expectations that corporate earnings would improve further encouraged 
investors to buy risky assets such as equities while pushing the dollar towards an eight-month low against the euro. 
"We saw from the FOMC minutes that there is little doubt that a further round of (quantitative easing) is likely to 
happen at the next meeting," David Morrison, market strategist at GFT Global said.
Aer Lingus was in focus at home with the stock down 1c to E1.14 despite a statement today that painted a rosy 
picture of trading in the past two months. It said that trading in the third quarter, and in the month of September in 
particular, has been stronger than expected. It said that the better results were down to improved yields with growth 
in line with the second quarter of 2010. Predicted revenues for October and for November indicate that the 
performance will also be ahead of expectations, it said. "At this time, forward revenues indicate that December and 
the first quarter of 2011 appear much weaker than anticipated, however, the Group is not yet able to determine 
whether this reflects the recent trend towards later bookings or an underlying softness in demand," a statement 
from the airline said. Ryanair shares gained 3c to E4.14. Banks were mixed. In its proposed M and T disposal 
circular, Allied Irish Banks reiterates that it expects to meet its revised capital requirement of E10.4bn through an

equity capital raising of E5.4bn (during November 2010, underwritten by government) and by the planned disposals 
of its M and T shareholding (raising capital of E0.9bn), its shareholding in BZWBK (to Santander, raising E2.5bn) 
and its UK business, and other capital-generating measures. The latter may include 'other minor asset disposals, 
risk weighted asset reduction initiatives and liability management actions', Davy Research noted. Shares in AIB 
were unmoved at E0.42, Bank of Ireland inched up 2c to E0.65 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 1c to E1.60. In 
an announcement to the stock exchange this morning, Readymix announced that, following approaches received 
from third parties, it is in discussions which may or may not lead to an offer for the entire share capital of the 
company. Shares in the cement company rose 8c to E0.25 - a gain of 47pc.

Body
Ryanair, today said that it will close its only French base at Marseille Airport from January following a lawsuit taken 
against it by French authorities over alleged illegal work practices by the Irish no-frills airline.
Marseille prosecutors last month charged the company with illegal working practices over the status of its 120 
employees in France, who were declared as working in Ireland.
Ryanair said all of its 200 pilots and cabin crew work on Irish aircraft, which it says is Irish territory and pay their 
taxes and social insurance contributions in Ireland where they receive their Irish pay.
The four Marseille based aircraft (and 200 Ryanair jobs) will now be moved in January to competitor airports in 
Spain, Italy and Lithuania, with the result that 13 Marseille routes will be closed from 11th January. Ryanair will 
continue to operate 10 routes to/from Marseille Airport, on aircraft and crews that are based elsewhere, the airline 
said. The row centres on whether Ryanair's base at Marseille and its flight crews fully comply with the European 
Directive on Transport Workers. Ryanair says this allows all mobile transport workers to pay income tax and social 
insurance in the country they work (which in this case is Ireland because they work on Irish registered aircraft which 
is defined as Irish territory) or where their employer is resident and where they are physically paid, which also in 
Ryanair's case is Ireland. The French authorities take a different view and claim that these workers should pay 
income tax and social insurance in France, rather than in Ireland, "even though this is contrary to EU regulations," 
Ryanair said. "We are very disappointed at this decision by the French authorities to initiate proceedings against 
Ryanair's base in Marseille, which complies fully with EU regulations for mobile transport workers. These are not 
French jobs, but rather Irish jobs on Irish aircraft, which are defined by EU regulations as Irish territory. All of these 
people pay their tax and social insurance, in accordance with EU regulations, in Ireland and they remain fully tax 
compliant," chief executive, Michael O'Leary said.

Court Of Appeal Reinstates Decision That BAA Should Sell Two Airports
Court Of Appeal Reinstates Decision That BAA Should Sell Two Airports

Body
(RTTNews) - The UK Court of Appeal on Wednesday dismissed an appeal by BAA Ltd. against the country's 
Competition Commission, which could call for the airports operator to sell two of its U.K. Airports. BAA expressed its 
disappointment over the ruling and said it will be seeking permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, while Irish 
low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) welcomed the court's decision.
The Britain's antitrust regulator was demanding BAA to sell Stansted Airport near London and either the Glasgow or 
Edinburgh airports to end up the company's monopoly and to promote competition. The court today reinstated the 
regulator's decision.
Commenting on the ruling, BAA said, "We note the Court's view that apparent bias in relation to a panel member 
existed during part of the Commission's investigation and will study this judgement carefully."
BAA already sold Gatwick airport in December under pressure from the regulator. The company currently owns and 
operates six British airports, including London's Heathrow Airport, and Naples Airport in Italy.
Meanwhile, Ryanair welcomed the UK Court's decision to dismiss the BAA monopoly's appeal. The low cost airline 
said the decision means that the sale of Glasgow and Stansted airports can now proceed, which will promote 
competition and a better deal for airport users and passengers.
Ryanair also called on the Irish Government to follow the recommendation of the UK Competition Commission and 
break-up the Dublin Airport Authority plc's (DAA) monopoly, as it believes the Commission's findings with the BAA 
apply equally to the DAA airport monopoly.
The group called upon the government to break-up the DAA airport monopoly by options including selling off 
Shannon Airport to the highest bidder or selling off Cork Airport to the highest bidder. Ryanair believes these sales 
will enable the Irish government to pay off most of the DAA's EUR 1.2 billion debt.
On Tuesday's regular trading session, RYAAY closed trading at $32.00 per share on the Nasdaq, while RYA.L is 
currently trading at EUR 4.14 per share, up EUR 0.03 or 0.80%, on the London Stock Exchange.

(RTTNews) - In a response to Court of Appeal judgement in Competition Commission case, BAA said, "We are 
disappointed that the Court of Appeal has upheld two of the five grounds argued by the Competition Commission. 
We note the Court's view that apparent bias in relation to a panel member existed during part of the Commission's 
investigation and will study this judgement carefully. We will be seeking permission to appeal to the Supreme 
Court."
Earlier today, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said that it welcomed the decision by the Court of Appeal to 
overturn the Feb 2010 decision of the Competition Appeals Tribunal which upheld an appeal by the BAA airport 
monopoly against the Competition Commission's original Mar 2009 ruling that the BAA airport monopoly should be 
broken up in the interests of competition and a better deal for consumers.
Ryanair stated that it welcomed the fact that today's decision to dismiss the BAA monopoly's appeal against the 
Competition Commission's decision means that the sale of Glasgow and Stansted airports can now proceed, which 
will promote competition and a better deal for airport users and passengers.

What a brilliant idea to replace the person in the right-hand seat with a member of the cabin crew.
This will reduce costs and allow even cheaper seats. All that is needed is a cabin crew person with a commercial 
pilot's licence or air transport pilot's licence, an instrument rating, the correct type rating, an in-date simulator check 
and the current legal minimum recent experience.
That person could then take the redundant title of co-pilot. As Ryanair probably operates with minimum cabin crew, 
an extra cabin crew member would have to be employed to replace the newly designated co-pilot for landing and 
take-off, or perhaps Ryanair could nominate a passenger who would only need to have the minimum qualifications 
obtained on a suitable course provided by Ryanair.
When captains retire the cabin crew member/co-pilot could be promoted to captain. This saves money?
The much better idea is to replace Michael O'Leary with a member of cabin crew. That person would be far better 
than O'Leary at staying upright and on course if times become turbulent.
I am sure many cabin crew would have the intelligence to become pilots, but I doubt if any have sufficient crackpot 
ideas to be able to replace Michael O'Leary.

Body
Sixteen flights between Ireland and France have been cancelled today because of a general strike over the Sarkozy 
administration's plans to raise the country's retirement age.
Ryanair has cancelled eight flights between Dublin and Nice, Paris Beauvais, Madrid and Rodez.
It has also cancelled two flights between Shannon Beauvais, as well as two between Knock and Reus in Spain.
Aer Lingus has cancelled two flights between Dublin and Paris, and said it will operate the rest of its services as 
normal. The strike is forcing French airports, trains and seaports to run below capacity as the unions seek to raise 
the stakes in their long-running battle against measures whose main feature is a rise the minimum retirement age to 
62 from 60. The nationwide disruptions are a serious test of Sarkozy's leadership as he tries to push through the 
flagship reform of his presidency. They were expected to reduce flights from Orly airport today by half and cut those 
at Charles de Gaulle-Roissy airport by nearly a third. One in three high-speed TGV trains on the national rail 
network would be running, unions said, while around eight out of 10 Thalys trains to destinations including Brussels 
would operate. The Paris underground is also running limited service. A series of protests in recent weeks have 
drawn millions of demonstrators. While the government is betting on them waning, unions hope Tuesday's turnout 
will exceed the 3m they said showed up for marches earlier this month. The protests came after the Senate passed 
legislation late on Monday that raised the age at which workers can retire on full pensions to 67 from 65. That vote 
brought the overhaul of France's pensions system one step closer to reality. The lower house of parliament has 
already approved the rise in the minimum retirement age. But union leaders vowed to keep up the pressure. "This 
movement will not slow after the Senate vote," Bernard Thibault, head of the CGT union, told I-tele last night. 
Limited power cuts targeting public buildings were expected, the union said separately, as energy workers downed 
tools. Families and students were also expected to join.

Sixteen flights between Ireland and France have been cancelled today because of a general strike over the Sarkozy 
administration's plans to raise the country's retirement age.
Ryanair has cancelled eight flights between Dublin and Nice, Paris Beauvais, Madrid and Rodez.
It has also cancelled two flights between Shannon Beauvais, as well as two between Knock and Reus in Spain.
Aer Lingus has cancelled two flights between Dublin and Paris, and said it will operate the rest of its services as 
normal. The strike is forcing French airports, trains and seaports to run below capacity as the unions seek to raise

EasyJet 's founder in £4m a year brand deal
EasyJet's founder in £4m a year brand deal

Highlight: Sir Stelios settles row with budget airline
The right to be chairman is given up
Body
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has turned a £1 annual payment from EasyJet into a minimum of £4m a year after signing a 
new branding deal to settle his two-year row with the budget airline he set up 15 years ago.
The total amount EasyJet pays Sir Stelios in the first decade of the 50-year agreement could be close to £100m, 
though this depends on how much money is made by the airline, Europe's second-biggest no-frills carrier after 
Ryanair.
In return, Sir Stelios, the airline's largest shareholder, has given up his right to become chairman and appoint two 
directors, and has agreed to let the airline use the EasyJet name much more freely.
The move was welcomed by some shareholders, of whom Sir Stelios and his siblings are the largest with a 
combined stake of more than 36 per cent.
"Yes, he's got his pound of flesh in terms of the scale of the revenue agreement, but they [EasyJet] now have 
access to areas of expansion they were previous blocked from," said one of the company's top 10 shareholders.
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at RBS, agreed that it was a "positive move", noting that it should end the 
"management and board distraction" over the dispute with Sir Stelios, which led to the departure of its chairman, 
chief executive and finance director last year.
However, one top 20 investor said a non-compete clause preventing Sir Stelios from using his name to brand 
another airline in Europe for five years left a "sour taste in the mouth".
"It doesn't look right to be paying that much money for five years to not compete with the group when he is still a 
significant shareholder in the group," said this investor.
EasyJet 's founder in £4m a year brand deal
The deal was struck on the eve of an expected judgment in the 2008 legal action that Sir Stelios brought against 
EasyJet over the terms of the original brand agreement made in 2000 when the airline was floated.
Under that agreement, the "EasyJet" name went to Sir Stelios, who allowed the airline to use it for an annual fee of 
£1 a year. EasyJet was also restricted from making more than 25 per cent of its revenue from so-called ancillary 
services.
Although EasyJet had been outwardly confident it would win the case, chief executive Carolyn McCall told the 
Financial Times there were a number of areas in which it might not have prevailed. "So the noise and disruption 
would have continued," she said.
Sir Stelios said the size of his fees should be seen against the fact that the EasyJet brand was, "with the exception 
of Facebook and Google", one of the best known to have emerged in Europe during the past 15 years.
EasyJet will pay Sir Stelios a fixed £3.9m and £4.95m respectively in the first two years of the deal, and 0.25 per 
cent of annual revenues after that.
The airline's turnover was £2.6bn last year but is forecast to reach almost £4bn from 2013. EasyJet shares closed 
up 0.6 per cent on Monday.

British firm is revealed as new backer of Aer Arann

The Stobart Group, a quoted British transport business, is the preferred buyer for Aer Arann, the regional airline that 
went into examinership in September.
The group, which has extensive interests in international freight, is finalising a rescue package worth about  10 
million to take control of the insolvent airline. Padraig O'Ceidigh, Aer Arann's owner and chairman, is working with 
Stobart and will retain a minority stake in the business.
Stobart was one of three bidders for the airline, and was selected as the preferred bidder late last week by the 
company's examiner, accountant Michael McAteer.
Stobart and the examiner are working out the details of the deal this weekend, and the British logistics company is 
expected to announce the deal to the stock market in the coming days.
The deal requires the approval of Aer Arann's creditors and the High Court.
One of the other bidders for the airline was a consortium involving technology entrepreneur Jerry Kennelly, who 
sold Stockbyte for $135 million in 2006, and Michael Carey, the owner of Jacob Fruitfield.
Their bid was put together by Niall McHugh of BMOL Partners, a Dublin-based restructuring expert.
O'Ceidigh was also working with this bid, which was fully funded with a rescue package worth about  10 million.
However, the Aer Arann boss opted last week to go with the Stobart offer.
A German private equity group was the third bidder.
Aer Arann sought the appointment of an examiner after running up losses of  18.2 million since 2008.
British firm is revealed as new backer of Aer Arann
The company's finances were hit by the impact of the volcanic ash cloud earlier this year, and the loss of a number 
of public service obligation routes to rival airlines, including Ryanair. According to a report submitted to the court, 
the company's creditors would face losses of more than  32 million if it failed to come out of examinership.
The Stobart Group was established by Eddie Stobart 40 years ago, and has interests in road and rail freight, and 
ports.
The company also has an air division, Stobart Air, which owns London Southend Airport. The group had revenues 
of almost stg£450million last year and said recently that trading this year was well ahead of last year.

Carolyn McCall knocked 7 per cent from EasyJet's shares with her first statement as chief executive and added 12 
per cent with her second . That's a lot of turbulence from a woman promising to bring stability to the low-cost airline.
Most airlines have had an eventful year (recession, snow, strikes and volcanic ash) but EasyJet's has been 
something else: the biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, took it to court; the chief executive left; and an 
operational foul-up caused crew shortages and delays. Ms McCall replaced the operations director on Wednesday 
and said the problems she flagged in July that caused the share price fall would be fixed. In the meantime, revenue 
has risen more than expected and full-year pre-tax profit will be slightly above the upper end of the forecast range 
of £100m-£150m.
The business still works, then, but Ms McCall and her team have to think about the broader strategy. EasyJet is 
cheaper than flag carriers, and more convenient than larger discount rival Ryanair because it flies to main airports 
rather than smaller ones that are often further out. More than a quarter of EasyJet's passengers are on business 
trips. But it could soon be squeezed from both sides: British Airways is defending its short-haul territory fiercely and 
Ryanair is thinking about becoming more "carey-sharey" , says chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Then there is Sir Stelios. The open warfare can't continue but neither can the new management team allow him to 
call the shots. His demand that EasyJet stop expanding its fleet and pay a dividend deserves consideration, but on 
its merits rather than for a quiet life. It is a lot to handle and investors will expect tangible progress at the full-year 
results presentation in November. The seatbelt light is still on.

Airline plagued by summer of troubles
Chief executive's review awaited
Body
EasyJet's director of operations has resigned after a summer of delayed flights and cancelled services at the 
budget airline.
Cor Vrieswijk, who held the job for four years, has been replaced by Warwick Brady, the airline's procurement 
director and a former director at rival airline Ryanair.
Mr Brady's appointment is the first to be made by Carolyn McCall, the new chief executive, and means that six of 
EasyJet's eight-strong management board have departed since the start of last year.
"Cor Vrieswijk has resigned and EasyJet has agreed to his early departure so that he can better balance his work 
and private life in Holland," the company said.
Mr Vrieswijk could not be reached for comment.
Although EasyJet has pointed to a wave of air traffic controllers' strikes in Europe as the main factor behind this 
summer's operational problems, the airline was forced in July to concede that staff shortages and poor rostering 
had also contributed to the upheaval.
Ms McCall is reviewing the carrier's operations, the results of which are due to be revealed next month.
EasyJet's punctuality came under fire recently after a report by Gatwick airport, the airline's largest base, found that 
fewer than half of its flights there in June had departed on time.
The record was worse than British Airways, which has suffered walkouts by cabin crew staff, and Air Zimbabwe.
EasyJet 's operations director steps down
Despite this, Ms McCall warned that looming walkouts in Greece and France next week could cause further delays.
She urged European governments to modernise the air traffic control system in an attempt to end the strikes, which 
cost the airline £6m in compensation in September.
The appointment came as shares in EasyJet jumped nearly 12 per cent to 433.30p after the airline said that a surge 
in demand for flights to beach resorts and European cities meant full-year profits would beat a prediction of £150m 
made in May.
The ash cloud, which closed European airspace in April, will clip earnings by £5m. However, this was offset by the 
£6m cost of compensating passengers whose flights were cancelled last month.
Revenue per seat increased about 6 per cent in the year's final quarter, EasyJet said.
The company is also embroiled in a row with its founder Sir Stelios HajiIoannou, who resigned this year. Sir Stelios 
clashed with board members 18 months ago when the carrier's largest shareholder warned that the business was 
expanding too fast into a deep downturn.

The ISEQ rose in line with the rest of Europe's markets with CRH and Ryanair the top gainers but AIB slumped by 
8pc after it said it is now selling off its stake in its US bank on the open market.
The ISEQ rose 29.05 points to 2,739.72.
Shares in AIB fell 3c to the historic low of E0.44 after it announced the sale process of the lender's 22.4pc stake in 
US regional bank M and T in a public offering of the shareholding after the failure of talks with potential buyers. M 
and T's share price closed at USD83 a share last night, valuing AIB's interest in the bank at USD2.2 billion (E1.6 
billion). However, the sale will be sold at a discount to the market value, leaving the bank with an estimated capital 
gain of more than E750 million.
Shares in Bank of Ireland gained 2c to E0.68 while Irish Life and Permanent rose 1c to E1.49. At the end of each 
quarter, Davy reviews its forecasts for CRH based on recent movements in key exchange rates. The broker has 
adjusted its second half dollar/euro exchange rate from 1.25 to 1.33 and its 2011 assumption from 1.25 to 1.37. 
"We have also adjusted the Polish zloty/euro exchange rate assumption marginally from 3.9 to 4.0 for H2 2010 and 
2011. The net effect of these changes is a slight decrease in our 2010 and 2011 earnings forecasts and also a 
reduction in our net debt forecasts as the negative impact of currency translation in H1 is partly unwound," analyst, 
Barry Dixon said. Shares in CRH rose 15c to E12.46. Rating agency Fitch has lowered its rating on CRH debt from 
BBB+ to BBB with a 'stable' outlook. Fitch is the latest ratings agency to review CRH. S and P reaffirmed its BBB+ 
rating in late August while Moody's maintained its Baa1 rating. In Britain, Sportingbet announced full yearresults for 
the year ending July 2010, coming in slightly ahead of the market's expectations. Net gaming revenue grew by 
26.8pc to £207.5m, helped in part by a strong World Cup and a gross win margin of 10.3pc. EBITDA grew by 
17.1pc to £46.5m with a significant increase in operating costs, given the World Cup and the associated marketing 
opportunities. Paddy Power's shares jumped 40c to E26.75. Accompanying its September traffic figures, which

The ISEQ rose in line with the rest of Europe's markets with CRH and Ryanair the top gainers but AIB slumped by 
8pc after it said it is now selling off its stake in its US bank on the open market.
The ISEQ rose 29.05 points to 2,739.72.
Shares in AIB fell 3c to the historic low of E0.44 after it announced the sale process of the lender's 22.4pc stake in 
US regional bank M and T in a public offering of the shareholding after the failure of talks with potential buyers. M 
and T's share price closed at USD83 a share last night, valuing AIB's interest in the bank at USD2.2 billion (E1.6 
billion). However, the sale will be sold at a discount to the market value, leaving the bank with an estimated capital 
gain of more than E750 million.

"We have also adjusted the Polish zloty/euro exchange rate assumption marginally from 3.9 to 4.0 for H2 2010 and

reduction in our net debt forecasts as the negative impact of currency translation in H1 is partly unwound," analyst, 
Barry Dixon said. Shares in CRH rose 15c to E12.46. Rating agency Fitch has lowered its rating on CRH debt from

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet plc (EZJ) reported Wednesday an 8% rise in traffic and a 120 basis point 
increase in load factor - a capacity utilization measure of airlines - for the month of September. The group also said 
it expects pre-tax profit for fiscal year 2010 to marginally exceed its earlier guidance range of GBP 100 million to 
GBP 150 million.
For September, traffic, which is measured by the number of earned seats flown, rose 8% to 4.77 million from 4.42 
million last year. Load factor improved 1.2 percentage points to 89.3% from 88.1% in the same month last year.
For the quarter ended September 30, easyJet expects total revenue per seat at constant currency to advance at 
least 6% year-over-year, reflecting good performances across the network, and especially by carriers plying 
between the UK and other European beach and city destinations.
The firm observed that disruption to European airspace caused by the volcanic ash cloud in Iceland will hurt its full-
year results by about GBP 60 million, and not GBP 65 million as projected earlier this year in July.
Further, easyJet said that the strike action by Air Traffic Controllers in France, Spain and Greece could entail the 
group to reimburse customers as much as GBP 6 million as compensation for flights canceled in September.
For the rolling 12-month period ending September 30, passenger count climbed 7.9% to 48.75 million from 45.16 
million and load factor went up 1.5 percentage points to 87% from last year.
For the first half or fiscal 2010, easyJet Plc had reported a narrower loss, reflecting a 13.3% growth in revenues that 
was backed by higher consumer demand.
easyJet's peer Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) is yet to release its September traffic statistics. Europe's third largest 
airline British Airways Plc (BAY.L) reported yesterday a 1.3% rise in total traffic for September, helped by a slight 
increase in capacity. Total overall load factor dipped 0.5 percentage points to 75.4%.
easyJet also revealed that it will furnish more details on fiscal 2010 results and outlook on November 16, 2010.
EZJ.L is currently trading at 419.0 pence, up 32.1 pence or 8.30%, on the LSE.

European equities bounced back strongly yesterday after six consecutive sessions of losses as positive economic 
data from the US sent confidence flowing through the region.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,065.82 as the US non-manufacturing sector showed ahead-of-
forecast growth in September. Strong data from the UK service sector further lifted sentiment, helping offset the 
negative impact of retail sales data across the eurozone showing a 0.4 per cent decline in August following a 0.1 
per cent rise in July.
General financial stocks moved higher as risk appetite improved. In Frankfurt, Deutsche Börse  was up 2.7 per 
cent to EUR48.46 in spite of Credit Suisse cutting its target price on the stock. In Stockholm, Investor AB was up 
1.6 per cent to SKr137.
In Paris, BNP Paribas rose 3.8 per cent to EUR52.97 in spite of Natixis cutting its price target on the stock.
However the broker raised its price targets on Société Générale  and Crédit Agricole , helping send the shares 
higher.
The CAC 40 was up 2.3 per cent to 3,731.93.
In other sectors, Paris-listed aerospace group Safran rose 4 per cent to EUR21.04 after it agreed to buy the 
propellants unit of state chemicals firm SNPE.
In Vienna, utility company Verbund rose 1.6 per cent to EUR26.94 after Zafer Kurtul, chief executive of Sabanci 
Holding, a joint venture partner, touted the possibility of an initial public offering for their energy joint venture, 
Enerjisa.
In Frankfurt, carmakers rose for a second consecutive session on the back of positive new registration figures for 
September. BMW was up 3.6 per cent to EUR49.96 while Daimler added 2.1 per cent to EUR44.69.
US and UK data spark upturn
In Milan, motor insurer Fondiaria-SAI jumped 6.6 per cent to EUR7.84 after Vincent Bolloré raised his stake in 
main owner Premafin, engendering merger and acquisition speculation.
In Dublin, Ryanair  rose 3.9 per cent to EUR4.01 on September passenger numbers.

The ISEQ moved higher this morning but sentiment was hit by news that Moody's may downgrade Ireland's rating 
again.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 11.23 points to 2,680.29.
Moody's today warned that it may cut Ireland's credit rating again, pointing to the huge bill for cleaning up its banks 
announced last week, a weak economic recovery and rising borrowing costs. As well as the bank bill, Moody's said 
poor recent data showed a cloudy outlook for the recovery of domestic demand and pointed to the sharp rise in Irish 
bond yields since its last rating action in July. 'Ireland's ability to preserve government financial strength faces 
increased uncertainty as a result of these three main drivers, which together would further increase its debt and 
aggravate its debt affordability,' Dietmar Hornung, Moody's lead sovereign analyst for Ireland, said in a statement.
Shares in AIB remained flat at E0.47, Bank of Ireland was also unmoved at E0.66 while Irish Life and Permanent 
jumped 7c to E1.47. In its interim results, Tesco commented on a stable like-for-like sales performance in the six 
months to end-August in the UK non-food category. The stable performance reflects 'slower market growth during 
the second quarter, particularly in the important electrical and entertainment categories'. DCC Sercom, DCC's 
technology distributor, supplies Tesco with consumer electronic products. Tesco is an important customer for DCC, 
whose shares climbed 8c to E20.52. Ryanair yesterday afternoon published its September pax stats showing 12pc 
growth to 6.84m, with a 1pc point improvement in the load factor to 86pc. With the September data now published, 
we can now tot up capacity and demand for the key fiscal Q2 quarter. Shares in the no-frills airline rose 2c to E3.88. 
Goodbody Stockbrokers note that Northern Foods said that its Q210 sales (to October 2) increased by 16.4pc 
annually in its Chilled Division, driven by its ready meals business, while its sandwiches and salads also saw a 
"strong performance". While some of this growth will be company specific, there should also be a positive read-
through for both Greencore and Kerry, both of whom are leading players in the UK ready meals business, a sector 
ISEQ up but held by Moody's warning ISEQ Up
that is benefiting from the reduction of production capacity in the sector. Shares in Greencore edged up 1c to E1.22

The ISEQ moved higher this morning but sentiment was hit by news that Moody's may downgrade Ireland's rating 
again.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 11.23 points to 2,680.29.
Moody's today warned that it may cut Ireland's credit rating again, pointing to the huge bill for cleaning up its banks 
announced last week, a weak economic recovery and rising borrowing costs. As well as the bank bill, Moody's said 
poor recent data showed a cloudy outlook for the recovery of domestic demand and pointed to the sharp rise in Irish 
bond yields since its last rating action in July. 'Ireland's ability to preserve government financial strength faces 
increased uncertainty as a result of these three main drivers, which together would further increase its debt and 
aggravate its debt affordability,' Dietmar Hornung, Moody's lead sovereign analyst for Ireland, said in a statement.
Shares in AIB remained flat at E0.47, Bank of Ireland was also unmoved at E0.66 while Irish Life and Permanent 
jumped 7c to E1.47. In its interim results, Tesco commented on a stable like-for-like sales performance in the six 
months to end-August in the UK non-food category. The stable performance reflects 'slower market growth during 
the second quarter, particularly in the important electrical and entertainment categories'. DCC Sercom, DCC's 
technology distributor, supplies Tesco with consumer electronic products. Tesco is an important customer for DCC, 
whose shares climbed 8c to E20.52. Ryanair yesterday afternoon published its September pax stats showing 12pc 
growth to 6.84m, with a 1pc point improvement in the load factor to 86pc. With the September data now published, 
we can now tot up capacity and demand for the key fiscal Q2 quarter. Shares in the no-frills airline rose 2c to E3.88. 
Goodbody Stockbrokers note that Northern Foods said that its Q210 sales (to October 2) increased by 16.4pc 
annually in its Chilled Division, driven by its ready meals business, while its sandwiches and salads also saw a 
"strong performance". While some of this growth will be company specific, there should also be a positive read-

Ryanair hints at switch to Airbus

Fuel reduction may prompt jet order
Body
The race to be the world's biggest passenger jet maker has taken a new turn as Ryanair, one of Boeing's biggest 
customers, hints at switching to Airbus, the US group's European rival.
The Irish no-frills carrier, which said it was looking at ordering up to 300 jets , said it would be foolish to disregard 
Airbus as the manufacturer weighs plans to upgrade its best-selling A320 aircraft with new engines, a move Airbus 
said could cut fuel bills by as much as 15 per cent.
"It would be unwise of us to ignore something that would give us a significant reduction in fuel," Howard Millar, 
Ryanair finance director, told the Financial Times at a Davy investment firm conference in London.
"We're interested in developments of the Airbus family in terms of any new engine option and given it's potentially 
going to produce a cost-saving reduction of 12 to 14 per cent."
No formal talks are under way, and the prospect of such will seem distant to some, given the chilly relations since 
Ryanair abandoned talks with Airbus for a lucrative aircraft order it eventually placed with Boeing nearly five years 
ago.
Airbus said it "has no plans to do business with Ryanair", Europe's largest low-cost airline.
But some analysts said Airbus might think again as it enters a sensitive phase of competition against Boeing over 
the huge market for single-aisle jets that the two companies have dominated for well over a decade.
Both face growing pressure from airlines keen for more fuel efficiency, while rivals such as Canada's Bombardier 
are producing their own single-aisle jets.
Ryanair hints at switch to Airbus
They have each spent months working on a response, such as upgrading engines on existing models - Airbus's 
A320's and Boeing's 737's - or taking the costly plunge of developing a new jet. Both say they will make a decision 
before the end of the year.
Dublin financial analyst Joe Gill, a veteran Ryanair observer, said although it was not clear that there was enough 
trust between Airbus and Ryanair to do a deal, if it did go ahead it would provide a huge boost for the European 
group.
"It would be a major strategic loss for Boeing in the European marketplace if Airbus could use the new engine 
option to swing Ryanair across," he said.
Should Ryanair desert Boeing it would break an unwritten rule of the budget airline business that having a mixed 
fleet of jets made by different manufacturers adds training and maintenance costs.
But Mr Millar said this would not trouble Ryanair, whose fleet of 250 Boeing 737 jets will grow to 300 by 2012, 
noting it had operated two versions of the 737 in the past, the 737-800 and the much older 737-200. "We're now of 
a size and scale with 300 aircraft that spreading the costs of running a dual fleet across a fleet of this size would be 
immaterial."

AIB shares have tumbled by another 11pc this morning as investors continue to bail out in the face of an effective 
government takeover.
The bank's shares have dropped by 4c to 43 in early Dublin trade.
The drop comes on a morning when the market overall has also retreated, with the ISEQ index down 9.48 points a 
short time ago at 2,652.55.
The slide in Dublin is, for once, less than that on other European markets, where buyers have stayed away on 
lingering concerns about economic recovery. The FTSE 100 in London is down 0.6pc this morning, with the CAC-
40 in Paris shedding 1pc and the Dax in Frankfurt off by 1.06pc. Back in Dublin, Bank of Ireland is flat on 63, with 
Irish Life and Permanent up by 2c to 143. Away from the financials, it is also a mixed story. CRH is up 10c to 1200, 
with Elan lifting 3c to 409 and Kerry Group adding 13c to 2579. Among the losers are Smurfit Kappa, down 8c to 
730, Ryanair dipping 1c to 383 and Glanbia off by 1c to 342.

Report from Munich: Istat conference
Report from Munich: Istat conference
AirFinance Journal
October 2010

Length: 561 words
Highlight: After the first day of Istat's annual European conference the mood has improved compared with 2009. 
While the industry appears to be returning to health, as always, challenges lay ahead.
Body
"People are actually talking about the future rather than worrying about survival," said Steven Udvar-Hazy, CEO, Air 
Lease Corporation, as he addressed over 500 delegates at the 17th annual Istat European conference in Munich.
Udvar-Hazy started the conference by addressing a number of challenges that aviation faces over the next decade, 
one of which will be large capital requirements. In his keynote address he said that the need for operating leases 
will increase to 40% to 45% of aircraft by the end of the decade.
And while, fuel prices, government regulations and taxes will burden airlines as they struggle back to profitability 
after the financial crisis, he said the only option was to fight these challenges by updating their operating fleets with 
new, more efficient aircraft.
For an industry that has a new hobbyhorse every year, 2010 has been about new equipment. Will Airbus and 
Boeing re-engine their current narrowbodies or opt for an entirely new design for the start of the next decade? It is 
the question of the year. And neither Airbus nor Boeing have stated their definitive plans, though Airbus is leaning 
towards a re-engining option.
Despite the efficiencies gained with a re-engined product, in his keynote address, Michael Powell, CFO, Wizz Air 
said: "We're always looking for the manufacturers to provide us with more efficient aircraft. However, we would 
prefer if Airbus to stick nine more seats onboard the A320 so we could compete with Ryanair's 737-800. That would 
be more efficient for us rather than a new engine."
And while the engine manufacturers CFM and Pratt & Whitney might be ready to re-engine the in-production Next 
Generation narrowbodies, Rolls-Royce will wait for the new air frames to enter the game, saying that the real game-
changing technology will come with a new airframe.
&
The secondary aircraft market is suffering
Pricing has improved for commercial debt and definitely for export credit. But one of the major issues raised during 
the financiers panel was the lack of debt out there for secondary aircraft. Export credit has closed the funding gap 
for new aircraft deliveries but financiers agreed that debt for refinancing is still tough. "If we look at the second hand 
Report from Munich: Istat conference
market, things are very difficult," said Bertrand Grabowski, board member, DVB Bank. "It's critically important to 
airlines and lessors that they can access capital."
There continues to be a focus on new aircraft with the older fleet neglected. "There's a dearth of supply in the 
second hand market - that's going to come back to bite the manus at some point,"&,& agreed Andrew Dewdney, 
managing director, HSBC. Not being able to shift older equipment will jam the market as airlines try to take their 
new deliveries.&
And going forward banks will face further problems. "Basel III is going to have a huge impact on the amount of 
capital banks are going to have to put aside for financing," said Pamela Smith, global head of aviation, Deutsche 
Bank.
All financiers maintained confidently that the right aircraft is a sound investment as long as capital providers are 
long-term investors. Jose Abramovici, head of aviation, Credit Agricole-CIB said that during the last 20 years Credit 
Agricole-CIB has made about a 20% return on aircraft transactions. Grabowski, too, remains confident with DVB 
Bank's $7 billion aircraft portfolio's performance.

The ISEQ rose after five straight days of losses but the news of the effective nationalisation of AIB sent the bank's 
shares nearly 30pc lower at one stage, limiting the ISEQ's gains.
The index climbed 19.10 points to 2,676.18.
AIB bank needs a further injection of E3bn in taxpayer funds which, when converted in to ordinary shares will give 
the State effective ownership. AIB this morning said it intends to raise E5.4bn from an equity capital raising round in 
November and another E5bn from disposals of assets, all to be completed by the end of the year, and it will also 
come under majority State ownership. It says the Financial Regulator has given an updated assessment of AIB's 
capital requirement and has increased the amount of equity capital required under the Prudential Capital 
Assessment Review (PCAR) from E7.4 billion to E10.4 billion. A E5.4 billion equity capital raising will be launched 
during November, which will be completed before 31 December 2010, it said. This equity capital raising will be fully 
underwritten by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission (NPRFC) at a fixed price of E0.50 per new 
ordinary share, which represents a discount of approximately 9.4 per cent to the official closing price of an ordinary 
share on the Irish Stock Exchange on 29 September 2010.
The Government said that it was delivering a definitive account of the total bank bailout cost in a move designed to 
instil confidence in the global markets that Ireland is solvent. However, the NTMA is cancelling any further bond 
auctions this year, citing the record high yield demanded. But Ireland is still at risk from a credit downgrade despite 
unveiling a "final" bill for bailing out its banks and vowing to get its public finances in order by 2014, Fitch ratings 
said today. AIB closed 4c lower at E0.51. Bank of Ireland, which will have to hold on to an additional E2 billion in 
loans that had previously been earmarked for transfer to NAMA, saw its shares fall 2c to E0.55 while Irish Life and 
Permanent climbed 2c to E1.39. Elsewhere, Ryanair hosted an investor day this week at its maintenance hangar 
facility in London's Stansted airport on September. "The cost and competitive position remains unchallenged and

cash flow/growth potential remains strong. However, while guidance is unchanged, we see clear upside potential, 
although visibility remains low," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair rose 6c to E3.92. The new Chairman of ARTBA 
(American Road Transportation Builders Association) has stressed the urgent need for a multi-year highways bill, 
especially given that ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) funds will drop significantly next year and 
will be virtually gone by 2012. "Our estimates have USD10.5bn in 2010 (following USD5.6bn in 2009), USD7.6bn in 
2011 and USD2.6bn in 2012, which clearly highlights the difficult annual comparatives ahead," said Goodbody's. 
Shares in CRH fell 3c to E12.11. Shanks Group, the international waste management operator, issued a trading 
update for the six months to September end. Management note while trading conditions remain difficult, they are in 
line with expectations. DCC Environmental represents somewhere around 5pc of the group profit, with roughly 75pc 
of the divisional sales coming from the UK. DCC shares fell 21c to E21.01.

The news of the effective nationalisation of AIB sent the bank's shares nearly 30pc lower this morning, dragging the 
ISEQ in to the red with it.
The ISEQ fell 3.33 points to 2,653.75.
The bank needs a further injection of E3bn in taxpayer funds which, when converted in to ordinary shares will give 
the State effective ownership. AIB this morning said it intends to raise E5.4bn from an equity capital raising round in 
November and another E5bn from disposals of assets, all to be completed by the end of the year, and it will also 
come under majority State ownership. It says the Financial Regulator has given an updated assessment of AIB's 
capital requirement and has increased the amount of equity capital required under the Prudential Capital 
Assessment Review (PCAR) from E7.4 billion to E10.4 billion. A E5.4 billion equity capital raising will be launched 
during November, which will be completed before 31 December 2010, it said. This equity capital raising will be fully 
underwritten by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission (NPRFC) at a fixed price of E0.50 per new 
ordinary share, which represents a discount of approximately 9.4 per cent to the official closing price of an ordinary 
share on the Irish Stock Exchange on 29 September 2010.
The Government said this morning that it was delivering a definitive account of the total bank bailout cost in a move 
designed to instil confidence in the global markets that Ireland is solvent. However, the NTMA is cancelling any 
further bond auctions this year, citing the record high yield demanded. But Ireland is still at risk from a credit 
downgrade despite unveiling a "final" bill for bailing out its banks and vowing to get its public finances in order by 
2014, Fitch ratings said today. Bank of Ireland, which will have to hold on to an additional E2 billion in loans that 
had previously been earmarked for transfer to NAMA, saw its shares gain 3c to E0.60 while Irish Life and 
Permanent climbed 3c to E1.40. Elsewhere, Ryanair hosted an investor day this week at its maintenance hangar

General strike in Spain against austerity measures

Body
A general strike against Spain's austerity measures saw tens of thousands of people take to the streets on 
Wednesday in protests that canceled flights, halted produce shipments and caused clashes between police and the 
public.
The stoppage was part of a day of demonstrations in several European countries to protest belt-tightening 
measures that unions see as punishing workers for a crisis they consider to have been triggered by bankers and 
traders.
Spain's first general strike since 2002, which set off demonstrations in more than 80 cities and towns, was called to 
protest the austerity measures imposed by a Socialist government struggling to slash its budget deficit and 
overcome recession.
In one of the largest protests, tens of thousands of people marched 2 kilometers (1 mile) from Plaza Neptuno to the 
Puerta del Sol square in Madrid. A similar demonstration took place in on northeastern Barcelona.
"I'm here because the labor reforms take away our rights on a fake promise that this will solve the crisis. That's 
absurd," said Madrid social worker Begona Martinez.
"The government is favoring the business class. The banks are still making loads of money, and I'm 38 with a 
degree and can hardly make it to the end of the month," she said.
As she spoke, hundreds of people joined hands outside Madrid's stock exchange building chanting, "thieves, 
robbers, speculators." Riot police stood guard nearby.
In Getafe, a town outside Madrid, a police officer fired shots into the air to disperse protesters outside a factory. In 
central Barcelona, students burned a police car and blocked streets with rubbish containers, prompting officers to 
fire rubber bullets.
Minor clashes between police and picketers were reported across the country, but there were few reports of injuries 
or arrests.
General strike in Spain against austerity measures
The government and unions gave widely differing views of the strike's success.
At midday, the two main unions said the strike was being heeded by 70 percent of employees and was a clear 
signal to the government to retract the reforms.
But Labor Minister Celestino Corbacho said the "strike had an uneven following and a moderate effect." He said it 
had wide support in industry, the automobile sector and in ports, but moderate backing in health, education, 
catering and the retail sector.
Spain's national carrier Iberia said only 35 percent of its scheduled flights were operating. Ryanair said it canceled 
all its domestic flights and most international flights to and from Spain. The protest left Madrid's Barajas airport all 
but deserted of passengers.
The strike caught some tourists off guard.
"I didn't know anything about the strike," said Japanese student Akiko Kudo, 29. "These are really turbulent times. I 
couldn't understand why the streets were so littered and so many shops closed. We couldn't get a drink and we 
were so thirsty with the heat."
In Madrid, buses were extremely scarce, but the subway functioned almost as normal.
Eighty percent of Spain's high-speed trains were canceled, all mid-distance ones were scrapped and only 25 
percent of commuter trains were running.
Garbage went uncollected in many areas.
In the morning, picketers roamed the streets of downtown Madrid. At midday, a group of about 100 strikers blocked 
Madrid's Gran Via, a major commercial thoroughfare, and merchants shuttered their shops when picketers 
approached.
The general strike marks a bitter split in the usually close relationship between unions and the government, which is 
struggling with a 20 percent jobless rate and a bloated deficit that has prompted market worries the country might 
end up in the kind of dire straits that forced a massive bailout for Greece.
The stoppage was called to protest austerity measures that include wage cuts for civil servants, a freeze on most 
retirement pensions, and labor market reforms that make it easier and cheaper for companies to lay people off.
"The strike was not called to topple the government, but it's up to the government if it wants to stay there," said 
Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, head of the Workers Commissions union, who called for the measures to be scrapped. "If 
it doesn't rectify, it is taking a suicidal path."
The unions have not threatened further strikes, and the government has given no impression it intends 
backtracking.
But not everybody agreed with the strike call.
Laura de la Fuente, a 24-year-old travel agent, said she disagreed with unions "and what is more, the situation in 
Spain is so bad we cannot miss a day of work." In Spain, workers who strike are automatically docked that day's 
pay.

Airlines canceled flights and picketers hurled eggs at buses and blocked trucks from delivering produce to 
wholesale markets as Spanish workers staged a general strike Wednesday to protest austerity measures imposed 
by a government struggling to slash its budget deficit and overcome recession.
The stoppage was the opening salvo of a day of protest expected to see tens of thousands of people converge on 
EU buildings in Brussels to protest belt-tightening measures that unions see as punishing workers for a crisis they 
consider to have been triggered by bankers and traders, many of whom had to be rescued by massive government 
intervention.
Transport stoppages were also scheduled in Greece, which had to be rescued by the euro-nations this spring to 
stave off bankruptcy and has also been forced to cut deep into workers' allowances.
In Spain, the national flagship carrier Iberia said it expected to operate only 35 percent of its scheduled flights as 
some air traffic controllers and ground crews honored the strike call. Ryanair said it canceled all its domestic flights 
in Spain and most international flights to and from the country.
Buses were extremely scarce in Madrid, garbage went uncollected and even electricity consumption nationwide 
was down by nearly 10 percent early in the day. Eighty percent of Spain's high-speed train trips were canceled, all 
mid-distance were scrapped and only 25 percent of commuter trains were running.
Picketers roamed the streets of downtown Madrid, trying to go into offices with pamphlets explaining to workers why 
they should not work. At midday, a group of about 100 strikers blocked Madrid's Gran Via, a major commercial 
thoroughfare, and merchants shuttered their shops when picketers approached. Tourists took photographs of the 
unfolding drama.

General strike starts in Spain against austerity
The stoppage was called to protest austerity measures that include wage cuts for civil servants, a freeze on most 
retirement pensions and labor market reforms that make it easier and cheaper for companies to lay people off.
"This strike is more necessary than ever," said one union representative, Roberto Tornamira, manning a picket line 
near Madrid's elegant Plaza de Cibeles.
Striking workers braving a pre-dawn chill staged a sit-in outside a garage housing buses in the Spanish capital, 
screaming "scabs" at drivers trying to get out onto the road. Some strikers scuffled with police. Spanish National 
Radio reported 11 people injured nationwide.
"We are here to explain to our colleagues the reason for the strike and urge them to take part and not work," said 
one striker, Mercedes Ramirez, amid a din of whistles and bullhorns.
Protesters prevented trucks from delivering fruit, vegetables, meat and fish to the main wholesale markets in 
Madrid, Barcelona and other major cities.
Labor Minister Celestino Corbacho said that in regions where unions had agreed to provide at least a minimum of 
services in areas such as public transport, those minimums were being honored almost 100 percent. The Madrid 
subway was running 75 percent of its trains, the region's government said.
Several regional television stations halted broadcasts shortly after midnight as staffers honored the strike.
Newspapers were also affected, with Wednesday's editions running fewer pages.
Not everybody agreed with the strike call. Laura de la Fuente, a 24-year-old travel agent, said she disagreed with 
unions "and what is more, the situation in Spain is so bad we cannot miss a day of work." In Spain, workers who 
strike are automatically docked that day's pay.

Ryanair has cancelled all its domestic flights in Spain and most international flights to and from the country due to a

Sixteen slights to and from Ireland are among those cancelled by the airline, with Aer Lingus cancelling 12 flights.
The strike, called as a protest against harsh cuts to reduce the country's budget deficit, is also causing transport

Workers are planning to demonstrate today against wage cuts, an increase in the retirement age and new labour

deficit. The strike is a test for Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialist government, though with 
polls showing only 9 pc of workers will definitely turn out it will not shake his austerity plans. The strike in Spain is 
taking place on a day of co-ordinated action across Europe to protest at austerity cuts. Actions are planned in 11 
European countries, including Dublin, with the European Trade Union Congress predicting that up to 100,000 
people will take to the streets of Brussels to protest against the EU's role in promoting austerity measures. The 
UNITE trade union has called for a huge turnout from its members for an ICTU march today from Anglo Irish Bank 
in Dublin to the Dail. Unite has written to its 100,000 delegates urging them to call on elected representatives to 
support the union's jobs campaign. That includes tax increases on high income groups, stopping public spending 
cuts and investing in public services and infrastructure. The union claims that current policies undertaken by 
Government to end the recession have failed.

Southwest's growth was one of the keys to its success, write Pilita Clark and Jeremy Lemer
Body
Southwest Airlines' move to buy its smaller budget rival , AirTran, is not just a big deal in the US.
It is also one of the world's biggest tie-ups in a no-frills airline business that effectively started with Southwest's birth 
nearly 40 years ago, prompting speculation about what it might mean for the low-cost industry globally.
Budget carriers around the world have copied the model pioneered by Southwest, which carried more than 101m 
passengers last year, more than any other airline in the world.
However, its relentless growth has begun to show signs of slowing in recent years and, as many analysts have 
noted, growth is not just a symptom of success in low-cost airlines, but a critical driver of it.
Getting bigger each year lowered Southwest's labour costs, as new staff tend to cost less than older ones. It also 
generated better returns because its aircraft were heavily used, says Bill Swelbar, a research engineer at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's International Center for Air Transportation.
As growth has slowed, costs have risen: Southwest's pilots and flight attendants are now among the best paid in 
the industry, making a return to expansion vital to maintain its profitability.
That makes acquisitions one logical choice, says Mr Swelbar.
"Southwest was a company built on a growth platform and it has had to look for new strategies for its business," he 
said.
The prospects of consolidation are seen as less likely in regions such as the Middle East and Asia, where budget 
airlines are a thriving but relatively recent addition.
AirTran deal casts light on no-frills model
But in Europe, an enthusiastic follower of the budget airline model after the US, the Southwest-AirTran deal raises 
big questions about Ryanair.
The Irish airline was an early follower of Southwest. Its outspoken chief, Michael O'Leary, has described a 
reconnaissance trip to meet Southwest's colourful founder, Herb Kelleher, as a "road to Damascus".
EasyJet's Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and Virgin's Sir Richard Branson have also acknowledged their debts to Mr 
Kelleher.
But few followed as successfully as Ryanair, the fifth-biggest airline in the world by passenger numbers last year, 
after Southwest, American Airlines, Delta and China Southern Airlines.
So could a big acquisition be a prospect for Ryanair?
Mr O'Leary dismissed the idea in an interview with the FT earlier this month. "There's nothing out there for sale, it's 
all rubbish. Everything for sale is losing money; would destroy our earnings," he said.
Should he ever change his mind, Ryanair is hardly lacking in financial ammunition.
With annualised cash flows of more than EUR500m, "it certainly has ample resources", says Joe Gill, director of 
equity research at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin.
One obvious target for an acquisition would be its closest rival, UK-based EasyJet.
But as Mr Gill points out, EasyJet would be much bigger for Ryanair to digest than AirTran would be for Southwest.
In addition, EasyJet has Airbus jets and Ryanair, like Southwest, has Boeings, and one of the lessons Mr Kelleher 
taught his followers is the desirability of a uniform fleet, with its lower crew training and maintenance costs.
AirTran also has Boeing aircraft, and while not all are the same model as Southwest's fleet of 544 Boeing 737 jets, 
analysts say they represent good value.
For all these reasons, Mr Gill is doubtful about Ryanair making such a move.
"It seems very unlikely that they are interested in buying another airline," he said. "They appear to be more focused 
on getting cheap aircraft."

LUFTHANSA EXTENDS ITS AIRBUS ORDER
FLEET Airbus's biggest customer, Lufthansa, has taken its backlog with the airframer to 91 aircraft with an order for 
32 A320-family aircraft and eight Rolls-Royce Trent 700-powered A330-300s to be operated by itself and its Swiss 
and Germanwings units. Lufthansa operates 325 Airbuses and now has 68 A320-family jets, 11 A330s and 12 
A380s on order. The carrier also last week ordered eight Embraer 195s for use by Lufthansa Regional.
RYANAIR CALLS FOR ATC DEREGULATION
LABOUR Ryanair is calling for Europe's air traffic control system to be deregulated and opened up to competition to 
prevent further ATC strikes, which it says have caused "unnecessary flight delays all summer". Chief executive 
Michael O'Leary says calling time on "bloated, inefficient, state-owned monopolieswill ensure that Europe's airlines 
and passengers are no longer held to ransom by striking ATC bureaucrats".
INDIA MAY OPEN MILITARY SKIES TO CIVIL FLIGHTS
AIRSPACE The Indian government is considering making part of the nation's airspace now closed for all but military 
use available to civil aircraft. Some 30% of Indian airspace is under military control, but dual, flexible use is seen as 
a way to accommodate the country's fast-growing civil aviation sector.
PILOTs, CONTROLLERs get one alert SYSTEM
investigations The US Federal Aviation Administration has launched a new, non-punitive voluntary safety reporting 
system that merges reporting by pilots and air traffic controllers into a single FAA database. Transportation 
secretary Ray LaHood says: "Having pilots and controllers provide information about potential air safety problems 
will help us correct them before they become accidents."
PARKING BRAKE ERROR BEHIND JETBLUE MISHAP

SAFETY The US National Transportation Safety Board says pilots of a JetBlue Airbus A320 that suffered four 
blown tyres and ground-down wheel rims in a difficult landing at Sacramento International airport on 26 August had 
mistakenly engaged the aircraft's parking brake during approach on an otherwise normal arrival.

Last week, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called on the government to abolish the  10 travel tax, 
promising that if it did he would bring six million extra tourists to Ireland per annum.
O'Leary was up to his usual headline-grabbing.
But maybe it is time to follow his advice.
More tourists mean more jobs - in hotels, guest houses, shops and throughout the economy.
At a time additional employment is urgently needed, it seems perverse to be charging people who want to come to 
visit the country.
True, the tax raises upwards of  100 million per annum.
However, attracting tourists is now a fiercely competitive business - and sometimes brave decisions are needed.
The key to developments of all areas of tourism is cheap and easy access to the country.
This means doing everything we can to reduce the costs to airlines of using our airports, and to encourage the 
development of new routes to service both the consumer and business market.
There are opportunities, surely, to encourage growth in Middle East traffic, for example and, hopefully, as things 
improve over the next few years, to attract back some more US tourists, who were once the mainstay of much of 
our tourism. The much-vaunted smart economy is not going to create all the jobs we need, and efforts to boost this 
area are long-term.
As - hopefully - growth takes hold in the international economy, tourism will start to pick up, and here is an area 
where jobs can be created quickly.

Shareholder revolt at Ryanair agm
Shareholder revolt at Ryanair agm

Low-fares airline Ryanair suffered a shareholder revolt at last week's agm when 19 per cent of shareholders voted 
against the re-election of director Klaus Kirchberger.
Kirchberger, the chief executive of Munich-based investment firm DOBA Grund Beteiligungs, was opposed by a 
number of institutions and proxy voters which were believed to be unhappy with the length of time he has spent on 
the Ryanair board. He became a non-executive director in 2002.
Some institutions and shareholder activist groups automatically vote against the reappointment of directors who 
have served lengthy terms. Sixfellow directors, including chief executive Michael O'Leary and chairman David 
Bonderman, have been on the board for longer than Kirchberger but were not required to go forward for re-election 
last week.
Despite the 19 per cent vote against Kirchberger's reappointment, motions to elect new directors Charlie McCreevy, 
the former EU commissioner, and former PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Declan McKeown were backed by 99 
per cent of shareholders.
The protest vote represented a significant increase on the previous year's agm, when motions to re-elect three 
other long serving directors - Kyran McLaughlin, Michael Horgan and Paolo Pietrogrande - were resisted by 
between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of shareholders.

After spending two years concentrating on fixing the exchequer deficit and fixing the banks, the government 
appeared, quite suddenly, to be very preoccupied with fixing the jobs crisis.
Taoiseach Brian Cowen organised a very public session with the heads of all the jobs agencies - for the first time - 
while Minister for Enterprise Batt O'Keeffe highlighted the benefits of a new innovation fund.
Comments by Cowen and O'Keeffe suggested that they would not rest until the half a million or so people on the 
dole were in employment. It all seemed like good PR stuff.
Matt Cooper, on his Today FM radio programme, asked Batt O' Keeffe whether the Taoiseach's new determination 
on jobs, had come about because of the challenge he faced trying to hold on to his own.
Cooper reminded the minister that a quarter of a million jobs had been lost in the last two years.
O'Keeffe batted back that one would want to be very cynical to take such an interpretation of events.
Yet it was precisely what a lot of people were thinking as they heard of Cowen meeting the employment agency 
heads all at once for the first time since he became Taoiseach.
O'Keeffe also emphasised that cabinet sub-committees, which included Brian Cowen, have been meeting agency 
heads very regularly.
At the very least, it is welcome news that the government appears preoccupied with the jobs question.
No government could solve the jobs crisis overnight, but the government side of the jobs debate over the last two 
years has been dominated by platitudes to the smart economy rather than anything more short-term or concrete.
The Inquisitor
It was another broadcaster who summed up the smart economy issue very well last year, when RTE's Marian 
Finucane told the then Enterprise Minister Mary Coughlan that calling something the smart economy was not the 
same as having a jobs strategy.
In truth, the question of creating jobs is incredibly complex.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary threw in his lot last week by repeating his call to scrap the government travel tax and 
then breaking up and selling off the DAA's assets.
The government might do well to scrap the tax, but flogging off a debt-laden DAA seems highly unlikely.
Ireland is one of the few countries in western Europe trying to get out of a recession without an economic stimulus 
package.
The question is whether we can afford one.
While borrowing over  20 billion a year, and paying nearly  30 billion for Anglo Irish Bank's mistakes, creating a  2 
billion or  3 billion stimulus package might seem worth a shot.
But it would be just that - a shot. It is quite possible that when the money is all used up, there might be little left to 
show for it.
Plus, it would send out the wrong signals to the European Commission which remains baffled (along with Central 
Bank governor Patrick Honohan, it seems) as to how we are going to get back to a 3 per cent budget deficit by 
2013.
The mood in Europe and the bond markets is for budget cuts in excess of  3 billion.
No room for stimulus there. In the meantime, the government can only try and refocus its PR machinery towards the 
jobs problem, rather than throw money at it.
The government has argued, over the last two years, that its massive capital investment programme is a kind of 
stimulus package in itself. It has also argued that, despite the exchequer difficulties, it is continuing to invest and 
spend on infrastructure.
Capital expenditure means money being spent in Ireland, which directly and indirectly affects jobs.
Once complete, the new infrastructure enhances the competitiveness of the economy - which should, in theory, 
help us all.
But if the growing clamour for deeper cuts than  3 billion comes about, it is highly likely that the capital spend will 
get heavily chopped.
It may, at this stage, be the least-worst option for the short term, given the deep cuts coming out of current 
spending, without commensurate reform of the public service to ensure better quality of service and efficiency.
At least last week the government was making the right sounds, on things like education.
Instead of talking naively about Ireland as a new innovation hub inventing everything and attracting the world's top 
brains, it was talking about sharply increasing the number of foreign students coming here to study.
Every foreign student we get, means cash coming into Ireland.
Perhaps there is a growing sense of realism about the kind of strategies being talked about for job creation.
But it is very difficult for any government to make it happen without spending money - cash that it simply does not 
have.
The Inquisitor
Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore made all the right noises on jobs when he was interviewed last week on RTE 
radio.
He talked about tourism, agriculture and food as areas that should be targeted.
Unfortunately, he didn't provide a lot of detail on exactly how jobs can be created in these sectors, other than saying 
we should ''use'' the many hotels built in recent years to aid tourism.
He did say that he agreed with Michael O'Leary's suggestion that the  10 travel tax should be scrapped. Despite the 
relatively new noise from the government around job creation, what happens in the bond market and getting  3 
billion of cuts through the budget in December is really where they are at right now.

Shares in Aer Lingus  have been climbing steadily all year, lifted by takeover speculation and reduced losses. 
Ryanair already owns almost 30 per cent of the national carrier and despite repeated knock-backs looks unlikely to 
withdraw its interest in acquiring the rest. The share price went above EUR1 for the first time in 18 months this 
week after Nicola Shaw bought for the first time. She joined Aer Lingus at the start of the year, but held no shares 
until last week's trade.
There was also a maiden buy at Regenersis 12 weeks after finance director Jeremy Wilson joined the technology 
group. Last Thursday, he bought 50,000 shares at 43p, helping to maintain the momentum into this week. Investors 
had already had a good month with the shares rising a third in the build-up to last week's results announcement, 
which reported higher profits. Earnings-per-share were down, reflecting an in-year rights issue that raised cash for 
an acquisition. Excluding the take-up of his allocation, executive director Gary Stokes has not traded for around 30 
months but he joined Wilson in buying on the same day to top up his stake by 16 per cent.
There were debut buys in spades at Metalrax Group  on Wednesday as three senior managers were joined by 
non-executive Gerard Wainwright and chairman Andrew Walker in buying for the first time. Both joined the board 
about a month ago but there were also long-servers among the investors. The shares had suffered prolonged 
weakness and bottomed out at 3p earlier this year but a steady turnaround since gathered pace this week as losses 
at the firm have diminished.
Andrew MacKay this week completed a hat-trick of directors to have sold out of IG Group  as shares in the spread-
better continue to shine. Chairman Jonathan Davie and Peter Hetherington took profits over recent weeks but 
MacKay's trade, in which he parted with more than half his holding, was the largest disposal this year. IG shares 
reached 530p at the start of September but the disposals pegged them back below 500p on Wednesday.

News In Brief
## Ryanair is set to move to more central airports across Europe as it looks to attract more business travellers. The 
airline is looking at moving away from low-cost airports well outside cities to capitalise on the higher fares business 
customers would be willing to pay. The low-cost carrier has gained much of its growth in recent years from sourcing 
airports with cheaper or no landing fees that allow a quick turnaround. Many of these airports, such as Brussels-
Charleroi or Paris-Beauvais, are dozens of miles outside the cities they serve. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary says 
the airline is looking at opening routes to all of Europe's major hubs, except for London-Heathrow, Paris-Charles de 
Gaulle and Frankfurt am Main. - Irish Independent
## Punters would have to hand over 2 pc of their profits on any winning bets to the state under a measure that is 
being considered for next December's budget. The Department of Finance is looking at a proposal to levy the 
charge on returns on winning bets placed by customers in bookie shops in the Republic as part of an overall shake 
up of betting tax. The department did not comment on the proposal yesterday, but two of the Republic's biggest 
bookmaking chains, Paddy Power and Boylesports, confirmed that they were aware of the plan, and both warned 
that it would drive more business to online operators based outside the State if it were introduced. - Irish Times
## Quinn Group has submitted a detailed restructuring plan to more than 30 lenders as intensive meetings around 
the group's future continue in London. Sources last night confirmed that the Quinn Group's plan was sent out 
yesterday afternoon. The document has gone to almost 30 bondholders who are owed 1.2bn euro, as well as to all 
Quinn's banks. - Irish Independent ## The NTMA raised a further 400m euro in short-term funding yesterday, 
through the auction of five and six-month Treasury Bills. However, the auction - which benefited from the 
substantially lower yields (or rates of interest at which the country repays the bonds) associated with T-Bills, in this 
case 1.9pc for the five-month bills and 2.23pc for the six-month versions - took place on the same day as yields for 
Roundup: Ryanair to use larger airports Ryanair Move
Irish long-term bonds rose even further, to 6.58pc. - Irish Examiner ## Charlie McCreevy is still earning up to 
132,000 euro per year as part of the European Commission's transitional payments system, a German newspaper 
has reported. It claims that he is the among highest earners from a group of 17 former commissioners claiming the 
payment. According to European Union rules, Commissioners are allowed to earn between 40pc and 65pc of their 
salary for three years after leaving office. - RTE ## Irish project management business PM Group has established a 
new base at Wavre, near Brussels, as part of a drive to expand in the Benelux region. As well as project 
management, PM Group also specialises in international engineering and architectural design. It has a particular 
focus on the delivery of strategic projects in the life-sciences area, particularly for high intellectual property and 
research and development projects. The company will employ 50 people within two years in the new operation after 
it won several biopharmaceutical and research and developments contracts with a combined capital value in excess 
of 400m euros. - Irish Times ## The Construction Industry Federation has predicted a further 50,000 job losses in 
the sector if the pace of the School Building Programme is not maintained. CIF Policy Director Martin Whelan was 
responding to Fine Gael Deputy Brian Hayes about why 80m euro from the Department of Education's allocated 
budget went unspent last year. Mr Whelan said the shortfall came about because of the Department's failure to 
proceed with new projects. - RTE ## A default on government-guaranteed debt at state-owned Anglo Irish Bank 
would lead to a funding crisis for the State and the bank system, former attorney general and European 
commissioner for Ireland Peter Sutherland will say in a speech in Dublin today. Mr Sutherland, chairman of 
Goldman Sachs Ireland, will tell the Institute of Directors' autumn lunch that the maximum saving the government 
can make on sharing Anglo's rising losses with the holders of senior and subordinated debt would be 5.1bn euro. 
He will argue that whatever the final cost of Anglo, only a small proportion would be saved by a default, and that 
such a move for a small country would "surely precipitate a funding crisis both for the sovereign and the banking 
system as a whole", adding that the collateral damage of such a decision would be "very serious". - Irish Times ## 
The managing director of the Irish subsidiary of State Street Corporation has called for 30,000 redundancies in the 
public sector. Addressing a conference in Dublin on the Croke Park Agreement, William Slattery said these 
redundancies were necessary to save money and increase efficiency in the public sector. He said they should be 
achieved by a cost-effective voluntary programme. - RTE

News In Brief
## Ryanair is set to move to more central airports across Europe as it looks to attract more business travellers. The 
airline is looking at moving away from low-cost airports well outside cities to capitalise on the higher fares business 
customers would be willing to pay. The low-cost carrier has gained much of its growth in recent years from sourcing 
airports with cheaper or no landing fees that allow a quick turnaround. Many of these airports, such as Brussels-
Charleroi or Paris-Beauvais, are dozens of miles outside the cities they serve. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary says

Business, tourism and community groups met last night to discuss their concerns for the future of Shannon Airport, 
which is experiencing what one hotel owner called "a frightening decline".
The meeting was convened after Ryanair's decision to further reduce services at the local airport as well as Aer 
Lingus' planned suspension of transatlantic services during the winter period.
Meeting attendees, including representatives of Shannon Town Council and Clare County Council agreed for a 
small group to seek an urgent meeting with Brian O'Connell, the Chairman of the Shannon Airport Authority (SAA), 
to find out what plans have been put in place to build traffic and provide additional services.
Group Chairperson, Mayor of Shannon Cllr. Tony Mulcahy said there is growing concern among the entire 
community regarding the situation at Shannon Airport. He explained that the purpose of the meeting was to see 
what positive actions could be taken to support the future development of the airport. "Everybody is genuinely 
concerned about the developing situation at Shannon but as individuals feel powerless to make a difference. We all 
need to take the situation very seriously and use whatever networks and contacts that we have to create an 
awareness in the region and beyond of the importance of a successful airport in our region. There are many 
positives that we can build on including the potential of a cargo hub and the immense benefits of Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) facility. For now we need to collectively come together and do whatever we can to support 
the airport. We also want to see what we can do and what initiatives can be implemented in the region to save our 
airport. We must act now and we will be seeking full support from our government representatives to ensure that 
Shannon can again be a vibrant airport," the Mayor said. Hotelier John Madden, who has operated for over 40 
years in the local sector, says he has witnessed a "frightening decline" at Shannon Airport in the last two years. 
"Shannon airport is one of the West of Ireland's greatest assets in terms of generating both tourism and industrial 
business to the region over a long number of years. However, it is very clear on the ground that traffic at Shannon 
'Shannon Airport in frightening decline' Shannon Airport
has reached a historic low. There is a serious challenge facing Shannon. Businesses in the region need to act now 
if the situation is to be prevented from deteriorating to a point of no return. Marketing initiatives need to be 
strengthened to support existing services and attract new services to the airport. An autonomous airport authority is 
also required to allow the airport to grow in the future," added Mr. Madden. Ted Germaine, proprietor of the 
Oakwood Arms Hotel in Shannon noted that the Mid West required a vibrant Shannon Airport to support new and 
existing business in the region. "Shannon has a new unique selling point as the only European airport with 
complete pre-clearance for customs and immigration for US entry. A more direct role for the Shannon Airport 
Authority in managing the airport's affairs would undoubtedly breathe new life into the County Clare Airport and 
deliver real potential for growth in the future. The subsequent knock on effects for tourism and business would be 
significant, especially at a time when the sector is experiencing its biggest challenge in many years," said Mr. 
Germaine.

Ryanair today said it plans to cut its daily Kerry - Dublin schedule from three to one return flight, from 31st Oct 
2010, blaming the Government's refusal to raise its Public Service Obligation (PSO) charges.
Ryanair said it is making the cut after "the Minister for Transport refused to honour his obligations under the Kerry 
PSO contract to increase payments to reflect the huge Govt imposed cost increases including the E4 tourist tax, the 
40pc rise in DAA airport fees and higher ATC charges which have added an additional cost of E19 per passenger 
on this domestic route".
"Ryanair, which already pays 'out of hours costs' of E76 per passenger to Kerry Airport (for the early morning 
departure and the late evening arrival) will now operate the Kerry-Dublin route on a commercial basis without any 
PSO subsidy whatsoever from 31st Oct thereby saving the taxpayer almost E2m annually," it said.
Under the Kerry PSO contract the Minister for Transport is required to increase payments for any cost increases 
which "were not, or could not have been, anticipated by Ryanair or are due to factors outside of Ryanair's control." 
"The Minister for Transport has refused to honour the PSO contract which requires him to increase payments to

E19 per passenger on the Kerry-Dublin route. Ryanair will now operate this route on a commercial basis without 
any PSO subsidy thereby saving the taxpayer almost E2 million p.a. Ryanair again calls for an ending to these PSO 
subsidies under which tiny passenger numbers receive enormous taxpayer subsidies to fund vastly inflated charges 
at Irish regional airports," Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said.

The ISEQ today lost all the gains it made on Monday and Tuesday with banks among the main fallers after the EU 
voted in radical new reforms of the banking system.
The ISEQ fell 38.16 points to 2,711.94.
The European Parliament has approved a radical new supervisory framework for Europe's banks and financial 
services. The vote paves the way for the legislation to become law, after being approved earlier this month by 
national governments at the European Council. The legislation will create three new agencies to supervise banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies, along with a panel chaired by the head of the European Central Bank to 
monitor risks to the broader financial system.
Meanwhile, there was little let-up in the pressure on Irish debt. The yields on Irish ten-year sovereign bonds edged 
higher again this morning while Credit Default Swaps broke another record high, despite yesterday's successful 
bond auction, market data shows. Yields on Irish Government bonds hovered around 6.3 per cent this morning, 
down from the record highs reached last week but still the highest in Europe relative to the benchmark German

The ISEQ today lost all the gains it made on Monday and Tuesday with banks among the main fallers after the EU 
voted in radical new reforms of the banking system.
The ISEQ fell 38.16 points to 2,711.94.
The European Parliament has approved a radical new supervisory framework for Europe's banks and financial 
services. The vote paves the way for the legislation to become law, after being approved earlier this month by 
national governments at the European Council. The legislation will create three new agencies to supervise banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies, along with a panel chaired by the head of the European Central Bank to 
monitor risks to the broader financial system.
Meanwhile, there was little let-up in the pressure on Irish debt. The yields on Irish ten-year sovereign bonds edged 
higher again this morning while Credit Default Swaps broke another record high, despite yesterday's successful 
bond auction, market data shows. Yields on Irish Government bonds hovered around 6.3 per cent this morning, 
down from the record highs reached last week but still the highest in Europe relative to the benchmark German 
Bund, apart from Greece. Meanwhile, the cost of insuring Irish sovereign bonds against default using credit default 
swaps hit a fresh record high this morning. Shares in AIB fell 3c to E0.60, Bank of Ireland lost 2c to E0.63 and Irish

The problem
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary recently said he would lobby aviation authorities for permission to use only one 
pilot a flight. In response, one of the company's pilots proposed in a letter to the Financial Times that 
Ryanair replace its CEO with a 'probationary cabin crew member' to save money. The company took the 
public needling in its stride, but should it have responded more forcefully? 
The advice
The academic 
Maury Peiperl
A culture of openness is essential in any company that has to learn fast and change with the times, but it has its 
costs. Washing some dirty linen in public is one of them.
Coming down hard on dissenters is one of the easiest ways to kill an open culture, so all credit to Ryanair for not 
taking that route. Because the pilot's jibe was nothing if not funny, the company and the public now get to 
appreciate it in a light-hearted atmosphere. The underlying regulatory issue, however, will get settled the way such 
issues usually do - through informed dialogue, lobbying and negotiation. I don't think the pilot's comment will affect 
the outcome one way or the other.

The conflict manager 
Jackie Keddy
Organisations may be within their rights to stamp down hard on employees who choose to air company issues in 
public. But whatever is said behind closed doors as a result of such airing shouldn't necessarily be made public.
Judgment call: Should companies rebuke employees for public criticism?
This seems like an example of a disgruntled pilot who could have chosen to bail out of his job, but felt sufficiently at 
ease to speak his mind without risking the chop. Ryanair's decision to not rise to the bait on this actually might work 
in its favour - showing an employer whose employees are able to let off steam about the boss or express 
themselves with such strong passion, rather than one that rules through fear and recrimination. At least, that's the 
way things might be seen from the outside . . .
The writer is co-author of 'Managing Conflict at Work'
The consultant 
Jonathon Hogg
E-mail, text, Twitter and the internet make it tempting, and easy, to express an opinion, pass judgment and critique 
your employer in public. Everyone will have felt the urge to have their say when the boss has done something silly. 
Leaders need to recognise it is impossible - and undesirable - to keep a lid on employee opinion.
To avoid painful and embarrassing public challenges such as this, companies need to create trust and transparency 
inside their businesses. Leaders should share their thoughts with staff, solicit intelligent questions, encourage 
debate and dialogue and, hardest of all, learn to tolerate dissent. That will go some way towards reducing the 
temptation of using the letters page to tell the boss what you think.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today claimed victory in the Commercial Court of Barcelona in a case brought by 
screenscraper website Lastminute.
It said that the outcome confirmed that Ryanair is legally entitled to exclusively distribute its fares.
The Court upheld Ryanair's right to defend its exclusive distribution policy by publicly addressing screenscrapers in 
terms such as: "illegal", "parasites of the sector" and "deadwood". Lastminute's claim for compensation and costs 
was dismissed.
This win against Lastminute comes just 2 weeks after the Commercial Court of Barcelona ruled in Ryanair's favour 
against Spanish scraper Atrapalo. Ryanair has also had similar court wins against screenscrapers in Germany, 
Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. "This Spanish court victory, coming just 2 weeks after Ryanair's win against 
Atrapalo, is another milestone in Ryanair's fight against internet screenscrapers and resellers. Websites such as 
Lastminute have for too long been getting away with unauthorised reselling of Ryanair's flights, with the addition of 
charges which consumers don't pay when they book directly with Ryanair," said spokesman, Stephen McNamara.

Two back-handed tributes to the influence of Vladimir Raitz have made the news this month. One was the idea - 
perhaps merely a stunt - from Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, that his budget airline's planes be 
allowed to fly with one pilot (this followed hard on the heels of earlier wheezes to sell tickets for standing room, and 
to charge for using the lavatory). The other was the unveiling, by Italian company Aviointeriors, of a "saddle seat" in 
which passengers would half-sit, half-stand.
These are tributes because Raitz, who has died at the age of 88, was a pioneer of mass travel. He has a strong 
claim to be the inventor of the UK package holiday, a concept that, from its inception in 1949, has brought pleasure 
to many, and sneers to the faces of a few. He had a large hand in creating what became, in the first postwar 
decades of steadily rising lower-class incomes, a burgeoning market in leisure, a commodity that working people 
had barely known before the war.
Mass consumption and leisure was decried by a left concerned that consumption would blunt class consciousness 
and by a right that saw in it vulgarity and an end to deference. But it became a social and political force that, by the 
mid-1960s, no serious politician could decry and few serious businesses ignore. Mass travel and leisure created 
Ryanair, and provided Italian designers with a space downmarket of Versace and Ferrari. Raitz laid a part of these 
foundations.
As he recounts in his memoir, Flight to the Sun , Raitz fell into the trade during an August 1949 visit to the town of 
Calvi - a former Genoese citadel - on the French island of Corsica. He was an exotic survivor: his White Russian 
family (minus the father, who disappeared) fled from the Bolsheviks in 1928, to Berlin then Vienna. Jews, they fled 
again from the Nazis, to London in 1936. Raitz quickly added English to his list of languages, attended the London 
School of Economics and joined Reuters: the Corsican jaunt was his first holiday.
A club had been created near Calvi's perfect beach, founded by fellow White Russians. Clients, mainly French and 
Belgian, slept in army surplus tents on the beach, drank all the wine they could and danced in the clubhouse. (The 
club's Belgian agent, Gérard Blitz, a former French résistant, later founded Club Med.) One of the club's owners, 
Baron Nicholas Steinhell, proposed to Raitz that he be the British agent. Quickly grasping the potential, Raitz 
returned to the UK, left Reuters, put a (then substantial) £3,000 inheritance into founding Horizon Holidays and 
chartered some planes.
Pioneer of sun, sand and disinhibition on a budget
The venture had been made possible by the US Air Force. The planes were surplus US Dakotas; the tents surplus 
USAF accommodation; the airport, a strip built by USAF Seabees. The first flight's passengers had to wait for the 
bus, sheltering from the unfamiliar sun, under the wing - there being no building nearby. Once they got to their tents 
- each with two camp beds - they discovered a paradise: constant heat, free wine and (a particular item in the 
advertising for ration-card Britain) two meat meals a day. The cost was £32.10 for two weeks: a substantial amount 
(£800 in today's money) but within reach of the non-rich.
The young tyro had to overcome currency restrictions, a British European Airways attempt to ban his flights and an 
order to expunge his "brash" advertising - "Come to Corsica" in large letters painted on Horizon's first office 
building, 146 Fleet Street. After that, it was all expansion - to Majorca, Sardinia and Malaga. Horizon prospered, its 
clientele spreading down the social scale, until 1974, when it was taken over by Clarkson's - in time for the three-
day week and oil embargo, which pushed the company into bankruptcy and its customers into hopeless queues 
waiting for relief flights home.
Raitz, however, carried on in the trade he had grown to love - organising tours for the Maltese Travel Board, 
managing Medallion Holidays and then the Hickie Borman Group - which went into receivership in 1991. He was 
77, in 1999, when Colin Trigger, chairman of Scantours, persuaded him to join in a package holiday venture to 
Cuba - flying back to a communist state, some 71 years after his family had fled Soviet Russia. He launched "cigar 
tours" - he had been an aficionado of Havanas since his late 20s - with some success.
His status as the "inventor" of the package holiday can be challenged: Roger Bray mentions Agostino Contarini, a 
14th-century entrepreneurial Venetian, who organised pilgrimage trips to the Holy land for 60 ducats a day. 
Tourism's infrastructure was laid by the Victorians: Thomas Cook took tourists to European cities from 1855, and Dr 
(later Sir) Henry Lunn organised winter sportstrips to Chamonix from 1898. In the UK, Billy Butlin opened his first 
camp in 1934, at Skegness; his second, at Clacton, opened in 1938, when parliament passed a law mandating one 
week of paid holiday to industrial workers - putting the first, fragile floor under mass British leisure demand.
But Raitz - imaginative, curious, a youthful survivor of murderous regimes, happy to be alive in a west at peace - 
brought together the elements of sun, sand and disinhibition. If he later expressed regret at the concrete-isation of 
the "charming little spots" in which he pitched his first tents, he did not express remorse for his central achievement: 
the facilitation of northern European joyous abandon beneath a southern sun.
Vladimir Gavrilovich Raitz, born May 23 1922, died on August 31, leaving his wife, born Toni Corkrey, three 
daughters and five grandchildren.

The ISEQ slipped in and out of positive territory today as global markets enter a wait-and-see mode amid conflicting 
data on the strength of the European and world economies.
The index rose 1.92 points to 2,796.96.
Investors were cagey about buying in to equities amid signs that all may not be well with Europe's economic 
rebound. Signs that momentum in the euro-zone recovery is slowing were evident yesterday as both the German 
Zew and euro-zone Industrial Production were both weaker than expected. German investor sentiment 
disappointed with the September ZEW Survey unexpectedly turning negative, falling to -4.3 from 14 in August. 
Investors looked to data from across the Atlantic for clues on the pace of economic recovery, with the New York 
Federal Reserve manufacturing index for September showing weakness.
Back home, banks were once again among the worst performers on the ISEQ with AIB down 2c to E0.72, Bank of 
Ireland was flat at E0.69 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 2c at E1.63. The financials continued to suffer 
from an outlook downgrade for Bank of Ireland. S and P has affirmed Bank of Ireland's credit rating but has revised 
the outlook from stable to negative as it expects the strengthening in the bank's financial profile to occur 'over an 
extended timeframe'. This follows the agency's recent downgrade of Ireland's rating (by a notch from AA to AA-). 
According to the latest data from the US, the total amount of funds obligated for highway construction in the 11 
months to end-August was USD36.24bn. Excluding stimulus funds, obligations were USD28.5bn, down 3pc from 
2009. Shares in CRH fell 11c to E13.10. Shares in Irish drugmaker, Elan, rose 5c to E3.84. The latest safety update 
on Tysabri was released last night (September 14th). Five more PML cases were confirmed in the month to 
September 2nd, bringing the total to 68. The geographic split is as follows: European Union 36, US 28 and rest of 
the world 4. Fourteen of the 68 patients (or 20pc) have died, and the other patients have varying levels of disability. 
Last week Goodbody Stockbrokers reported that the latest price tracker showed that unbleached kraftliner price

increases in the UK had gone through in one step (USD70/tonne to USD770-790/tonne), but there was no 
movement in testliner. However, according to weekly figures from Foex yesterday, both grades have now moved. 
Over the last week Kraftliner is up E11/tonne and testliner is up E11-12/tonne. Shares in Smurfit Kappa dipped 15c 
to E7.62. Ryanair stocks went ex-dividend for E0.34 per share (8.5pc yield) yesterday and the share price should 
now adjust to E3.68 using last night's close as a reference point, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. This implies 
the stock is trading on 13.1 times its rolling 12 month forward earnings, when its more typical range is 15 to 19 
times. On Tuesday, the stock managed to close above the psychological E4 level. However, the arrival of the ex-
date will make technical traders wait a while longer for a potential break-out. Looking at the fundamentals, we note 
that when Ryanair first reached E4 in 2002 it had 15m passengers versus 70m now and revenue was E0.85bn v 
E3.6bn this time around, the broker said. The airline's shares closed down 22c to E3.79.

Ryanair 's latest no-frills idea: sack the boss
Ryanair's latest no-frills idea: sack the boss

Highlight: Airline cost-cutting
One of Michael O'Leary's pilots has urged him to make way for a cabin crew member. Pilita Clark reports
Body
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has for years endured complaints from passengers about his famously no-frills Irish 
airline.
Now a senior Ryanair pilot has taken the rare step of publicly challenging his boss after the outspoken chief 
executive said he was trying to convince authorities to let his aircraft fly with only one pilot. A flight attendant could 
do the job of a co-pilot if needed, Mr O'Leary said last week, because "the computer does most of the flying now".
Captain Morgan Fischer, who trains other pilots at Ryanair's Marseilles base, says he knows the airline is dedicated 
to keeping its costs as low as possible, so why not go one better - and replace Mr O'Leary with a junior flight 
attendant?
"I would propose that Ryanair replace the CEO with a probationary cabin crew member currently earning 
approximately EUR13,200 net per annum," Capt Fischer has written in a letter to the Financial Times, which also 
reported Mr O'Leary's comments last week .
"Ryanair would benefit by saving millions of euros in salary, benefits and stock options," the captain said, and there 
would be no need for approval from the authorities.
Mr O'Leary quibbled with some of Capt Fischer's numbers but, in characteristically mischievous mode, he affected 
to agree with some of his points.
"Michael thinks that cabin crew would make a far more attractive CEO than him - this obviously isn't a very high bar 
- so we are going to seriously look at the suggestion," said Stephen McNamara, a Ryan-air spokesman. "After all, if 
we can train cabin crew to land the plane, it should be no problem training them to do Michael's job as well."
Capt Fischer, 41, who has been based in Marseilles for the past five years and has 20 years' flying experience, 
mostly with TWA and American Airlines, declined to comment further on Monday.
Ryanair 's latest no-frills idea: sack the boss
Mr O'Leary is well known for his ability to generate headlines with eye-catching ideas, from coin-operated lavatories 
to "fat taxes". But his thoughts on ditching co-pilots - first raised in a Bloomberg Businessweek interview earlier this 
month - seem to have struck a sensitive nerve among some.
Ryanair employees have complained to the media in the past, but most have done so anonymously.
Seeing a pilot publicly poke fun at Mr O'Leary, as Capt Fischer has done, is "extremely unique", said Capt Evan 
Cullen, president of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association, who has also written to the FT about Mr O'Leary's 
comments.
Capt Cullen was provoked by Mr O'Leary's suggestion that, in 25 years, Ryanair had had only one pilot who had 
suffered a heart attack in flight, "and he landed the plane".
Capt Cullen said Mr O'Leary must have been referring to a 2002 incident in Belgium when a pilot collapsed with a 
heart attack shortly after take-off from Charleroi airport south of Brussels. A doctor on board who assisted the pilot 
described him as "clinically dead", according to a report by Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit, and the co-pilot 
had to return the aircraft to the airport.
"The safety implications are obvious, as is the reason for having two qualified pilots in the cockpit," said Capt 
Cullen.
Mr McNamara said this was not the incident Mr O'Leary had been referring to, "although the fact that the first officer 
landed the aircraft without incident underlines the fact that a first officer in the cabin, or a suitably-trained cabin 
crew, could readily land an aircraft in such an emergency".
He said the issue at stake was that aircraft were now heavily automated, and with more than 500,000 flights a year 
the second pilot was rarely, if ever, called on to land in an emergency.
Some safety experts dis-agree. "It is true that aircraft are far safer today than ever before and many of the 
processes have been automated," said Paul Hayes, air safety director at Ascend aviation consultan-cy. "But in a 
high work-load situation, say an instrument approach in congested air space or in an emergency, I'd still like to have 
a pilot and co-pilot working together as a team."

From Captain Evan Cullen.
Sir, I refer to " Ryanair's talk of spree on aircraft casts cloud over dividend hopes " (September 8) where Michael 
O'Leary is quoted as saying that the risk of pilot incapacitation does not merit the presence or cost of a qualified co-
pilot.
Mr O'Leary is notably skilful at obtaining publicity by means of outrageous statements that the media find 
newsworthy. However, his misrepresentations in this case demand clarification. His claims that there was only one 
such incident in 25 years and that the pilot "landed the plane" are incorrect.
In fact, there have been at least two significant events in Ryanair involving crew member incapacitation. In the 
reported event, the physicians who eventually reached the cockpit determined the captain to be clinically dead. 
(While he was revived following strenuous efforts he subsequently died.) The captain did not land the aircraft. 
However, the safety outcome was well within tolerances expected in such rare events. This testifies to the key role 
played by the co-pilot.
In the second incident, the incapacity of a captain gave rise to potentially grave consequences that exceeded 
acceptable safety tolerances. The safety implications are obvious, as is the reason for having two qualified pilots in 
the cockpit.
In respect of Mr O'Leary's comments, members of the deceased captain's family wish that these matters be 
clarified. The family note that the official accident report contains references to failures of training in pilot 
incapacitation provided to the cabin crew, as well as the elapsed time prior to providing the captain with oxygen and 
medical assistance. Their appreciation of all the events and circumstances surrounding the incapacitation event is 
very different from that represented by Mr O'Leary.

Ryanair chief's plan to cut co-pilots raises a safety issue
From Captain Morgan Fischer.
Sir, I would like to share with you a cost-saving suggestion I have proposed to the Ryanair board. I write in my 
capacity as a B737-800 line training captain assigned to Ryanair's Marseilles, France base. My primary job 
responsibility involves the line training and checking of co-pilots and captains on both an initial and a recurrent 
basis.
As a Ryanair employee, I am aware of the company's desire to reduce costs whenever feasible, and, in so doing, 
pass on these lower costs in the form of lower fares to the travelling public.
I would propose that Ryanair replace the chief executive with a probationary cabin crew member currently earning 
about EUR13,200 net a year. Ryanair would benefit by saving millions of euros in salary, benefits and stock 
options. Further, there will be no need to petition either Boeing or governmental aviation regulators for approval to 
replace the CEO with a cabin crew member; as such approval would not be required.
Finally, the position of CEO could, in fact, become a source of ancillary revenue for Ryanair. Currently, Ryanair's 
contract cabin crew providers charge new recruits for the cost of their training - EUR3,000 in fact. Ryanair could 
similarly charge EUR3,000 for the training required to become chief executive.

Ryanair's success is extraordinary, not just for an airline but for any business, writes Pilita Clark . It has grown 
from a tiny outfit in 1985 flying 5,000 passengers a year between Ireland and London in a single aircraft, to an 
operation with more than 200 aircraft flying about 70m passengers a year to roughly 160 destinations.
When Michael O'Leary took over in 1994, he aggressively expanded the airline into a highly profitable operation. 
Only four airlines in the world carry more passengers. British Airways ranks 18th.
BA has, however, lost almost £1bn over the past two years in a downturn that has seen airlines round the world slip 
into the red. Ryanair did lose EUR180.5m the year before last, but made a pre-tax profit of EUR341m in the 12 
months to the end of March this year, making it one of the most profitable carriers in Europe.

Aer Lingus no longer sees the Ryanair model as the way to go in the next few years, its chief executive, Christoph 
Mueller told the Chartered Accountants Leinster Society.
He said he expects demand for air travel to stay depressed into next year.
Mr Mueller embarked on a cost-cutting drive straight after getting the top job a year ago, and last month the chief 
executive vowed to continue that into next year to help preserve the airline's independence.
But he said he would not try to boost capacity, or offer uneconomically low fares just to lure passengers to Aer 
Lingus at a time when the Irish economy remains weak. 'There will be no growth in Aer Lingus, same capacity into 
next year,' Mr Mueller said, adding that he might revise capacity plans if the market improved by next summer. He 
also told his audience that prices in Ireland were 'significantly higher' tha in other countries, and were comparable 
with Switzerland. Mr Mueller said he stopped trying to copy Ryanair's approach last autumn. Ryanair helped 
transform air travel in Europe by offering fares which for the first time allowed less well-off passengers to travel 
abroad for a weekend break or a stag party. But Mr Mueller said: 'If you want to base that (expansion) on the binge 
drinking desires of the Irish population, that's certainly not a wise thing to do,' he added.

Body
The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) today called on the Government to abolish the E10 travel tax to reverse the 
disastrous decline in visitor numbers, which continues unabated.
Paul Gallagher, President, IHF, said that Irish tourism is now at a tipping point with announced reductions in 
capacity by Ryanair adding to the perilous state of the sector and posing an additional threat to the viability of 
tourism businesses across the country.
With seat capacity into Ireland now reduced by 75,000 a week on 2009, the recent decisions by Ryanair to reduce 
capacity at Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports and the very negative outlook from Aer Lingus highlight the need to 
provide greater incentives for airlines to increase capacity, he said.
"We are calling on Minister Hanafin to intervene at cabinet level to ensure the E10 departure tax on airlines is 
abolished or, at the very least, deferred for two years to allow industry and carriers a window of opportunity to 
achieve growth in visitor numbers. At this stage, the tax is doing more harm than good to the economy with the 
exchequer forfeiting substantial revenue including lost employment tax and VAT," Mr Gallagher said. "Carriers into 
Ireland will reduce capacity further by removing there assets to more profitable destinations unless industry and 
Government adopt joined up thinking in relation to the barriers to profitable routes. With over 200,000 people 
employed by the sector across the country, any further decline in the sector will result in significant job losses." "As 
an island nation, increased accessibility via our airports and ports is a vital factor in promoting Irish tourism. It's now 
time for the Government to work hand-in-hand with airlines and ferry operators to address falling capacity levels 
and insure routes in and out of Ireland can be operated on a profitable basis. This will require immediate action to 
remove all unnecessary barriers and reduce charges at airports and ports."

Body
Ryanair today said it is make a further 21pc cut in its Shannon services, blaming increases in passenger fees by the 
airport operator.
"The 'triple whammy' of Shannon's high costs, their refusal to extend Ryanair's 5 year base deal, and the imposition 
of the Govt's E10 tourist tax has devastated traffic, tourism and jobs at Shannon Airport and the Mid West region," a 
statement from the airline said.
Ryanair announced that from 1 November, its Shannon-Paris route (currently 4 rotations per week) will be closed, 
Ryanair's Shannon-Gatwick route will be cut from 7 to 6 rotations per week and Ryanair's Shannon-Stansted 
service will be cut from 13 to 11 rotations per week.
These further flight cuts at Shannon will reduce Ryanair's operation from 31 to 24 weekly rotations and reduce 
Ryanair's traffic at Shannon from over 480,000 to under 380,000 a year, it said. "It is clear that the Irish Government 
and the DAA monopoly, are determined to destroy Irish air traffic, Irish tourism and Irish jobs. In the two years since 
the Govt introduced a E10 tourist tax and ordered over 50pc increases in DAA airport fees, traffic at the three main 
Irish airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon) has plunged by 33pc from over 30m to just 20m passengers. Ireland has 
lost 10m air passengers, over 10,000 jobs in airport and related services, and over E1 billion of lost tourism and 
visitor spend annually," CEO Michael O'Leary said. "In the year to April 2009 (before the Government's E10 tourist 
tax), Ryanair was on track to deliver 1.9m passengers at Shannon. Now just two years later, following the E10 
tourist tax and 33pc price hikes at Shannon, Ryanair's traffic will fall to less than 400,000, less than one fifth of what 
Ryanair's base was and could again be delivering. While the three Irish airports have lost 10m passengers in just 
two years, Ryanair has grown from 60m to 73.5m passengers annually. Ryanair has now overtaken Alitalia to 
become the No.1 airline in Italy and Iberia to become the No.1 airline in Spain, yet we are cutting flights and 
passengers in our home market Ireland," he added.

Highlight: O'Leary applies to fly jets without co-pilots
Body
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief, is back in the market to buy up to 300 aircraft, in a multibillion-dollar move that 
could scupper investors' hopes of future dividends from Europe's leading budget airline.
He also revealed he is writing to aviation authorities for permission to use only one pilot per flight because he says 
co-pilots are unnecessary in modern jets where "the computer does most of the flying now".
"It would save the entire industry a fortune," Mr O'Leary said in an interview, adding that trains were allowed to have 
one driver even though this could conceivably cause a crash in the event of a heart attack.
"In 25 years with over about 10m flights, we've had one pilot who suffered a heart attack in flight and he landed the 
plane," he said.
He conceded that two pilots would be needed on long haul international flights but on Ryanair's shorter trips, flight 
attendants could do the job of a co-pilot, who was only there to "make sure the first fella doesn't fall asleep and 
knock over one of the computer controls".
His comments come as the Dublin-based airline prepares to pay a EUR500m (£414m) dividend next month - its first 
- after Mr O'Leary pulled out of a deal to buy 200 Boeing jets late last year.
He has held out the prospect of paying a second dividend in 2013, unless Ryanair found a better use for its growing 
pile of cash which, he said, might not happen.
This prompted some analysts to suggest he was finally reining back the airline's aggressive growth strategy.
"All other things being equal, if we're still generating this amount of cash and we haven't found any acquisition or 
aircraft acquisition for it, then we would certainly consider a second dividend by about the end of 2013.
"But if I was a shareholder I wouldn't be banking on that yet."
Ryanair 's talk of spree on aircraft casts cloud over dividend hopes
He said he saw no airlines on the market worth buying, but there was still the option of purchasing not just the 200 
Boeing jets, worth about $15bn (£9.8bn) at advertised prices, but up to 300 from either Boeing or its rival, Airbus.
Ryanair had told both manufacturers in early summer that it could buy "200 to 300" aircraft if suitable prices and 
terms were offered, he said, though there were no negotiations at present.

This prompted some analysts to suggest he was finally reining back the airline's aggressive growth strategy that 
has seen it grow into a budget behemoth carrying twice as many passengers as older rivals such as British 
Airways.
But others warned growth ran deep in the veins of the airline and it appears they may still turn out to be correct.
"All other things being equal, if we're still generating this amount of cash and we haven't found any acquisition or

"We could buy these damn planes tomorrow if these guys just make up their minds, on prices in Airbus's case, or 
make up their minds on the delivery conditions in Boeing's case," he said.
"The ball is in their court. Unless someone makes us an offer of serious pricing for a serious number of planes we 
won't bite," Mr O'Leary said.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, could be in the market for up to 300 aircraft, the company's chief 
executive was quoted as saying in an interview today.
Ryanair had pulled out of talks last year to buy 200 jets from Boeing after failing to agree on certain conditions.
But Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times there was still the option of buying not only the 200 Boeing jets - worth 
about dollar 15 billion - but up to 300 from either Boeing or its rival Airbus. Airbus's parent is EADS.
He said he saw no airline on the market worth buying. O'Leary also told the paper that he is seeking permission 
from aviation authorities to use only one pilot per flight as a way to cut back on costs. "It would save the entire 
industry a fortune," O'Leary said.

Michael O'Leary's role as aviation industry provocateur - most recently by proposing to get rid of co-pilots - is a 
long-haul affair. By contrast, his flight of fancy as boss of a dividend-paying, ex-growth airline always looked more 
likely to be a short hop. Now - as this column predicted when the Ryanair chief pulled out of a deal with Boeing in 
December - he is back on his fleet expansion drive. Unless Mr O'Leary thinks it would be useful as a way of 
goading EasyJet's Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou , Ryanair's mooted second special dividend looks as likely to be 
abolished as its second pilots are to be retained.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary might be one of the world's great technophobes who famously claims not to use e-
mail, but he has fallen in love with his new iPad.
Unlike his iPhone, which he thinks is "a hopeless phone" that the loquacious chief kept losing until he swapped it for 
a museum-era Nokia mobile, Mr O'Leary said the iPad was "great" not least for checking on company figures. All 
the better to help him come up with ways of squeezing more out of his customers.

Bank shares fell sharply today, dragging the main Dublin ISEQ index lower as the Government extended its blanket 
guarantee on the bank's debts but failed to reassure investors that the debt crisis is in hand.
The index fell 24.47 points to 2,782.64.
Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, has announced that the Government guarantee for short term bank liabilities 
will be extended to the end of December. He said that this includes corporate and interbank deposits as well as 
debt securities that will be extended from its current expiry date of 29 September to 31 December 2010. A State 
guarantee will therefore be available for both short- and long-term liabilities up to the end of the year. "This is an 
important support to the Irish banking system facilitating their access to both short- and longer-term funding to help 
maintain the overall stability of the banking sector and complements the broad Government Strategy to restore fully 
the banking system and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery," he said. "This modification to the 
Guarantee was recommended to the Minister by both the Governor of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator 
and the NTMA. As is customary the Department will be liaising with the European Central Bank on this measure. An 
approval by the European Commission under the State aid rules needs to be secured before the guarantee can be 
extended."
However, Shares in AIB dived 5c to E0.76 and Bank of Ireland lost 5c to E0.72 while Irish Life and Permanent 
slumped 11c to E1.69. A Wall Street Journal report said Europe's recent "stress tests" of the strength of major 
banks underestimated some lenders' holdings of potentially risky government debt. This helped rekindle concerns 
about the vulnerability of the sector after Germany's banking association said on Monday the country's 10 biggest 
banks may need E105 billion of additional capital. President Obama has announced plans to implement a second 
stimulus for highways, rail and runways in the US. Shares in CRH failed to gain from the news with the stock falling 
19c to E13.48. DS Smith, one of Smurfit Kappa's peers in the corrugated market, has issued a brief trading update 
ISEQ down as bank share take a beating ISEQ Falls
for the period since May 1st. Its paper and packaging division has had a good first quarter with positive demand 
trends continuing in the UK and Europe. Increasing paper prices have resulted in profits in line with expectations 
and the outlook remains positive. Smurfit Kappa's shares fell 2c to E7.50. Aer Lingus, Air Berlin, Air France-KLM 
and Norwegian have released August traffic statistics today while Ryanair released August traffic statistics 
yesterday. Aer Lingus had an overall load factor of 85.7pc, an increase of 2.7pp compared with August 2009. The 
company continues to show strength in long-haul, with a load factor in August of 89.9pc, an increase of 10.2pp 
year-on-year. Ryanair saw an August load factor of 89pc, -1pp, while passengers increased by 12pc as compared 
to August 2009. Aer Lingus shares dropped 1c to E0.91 while Ryanair stocks were down 2c to E3.83.

Ryanair today said it has won a case brought by a "screenscraper", which confirms the Irish no-frills airline's 
exclusive right to its fares under the Spanish constitution.
It welcomed its victory in the Commercial Court of Barcelona (in a case brought by screenscraper website 
Atrapalo), which confirmed that Ryanair is entitled under the Spanish Constitution to exclusively distribute its fares, 
it said.
The Spanish Court also ruled that Ryanair's comparative advertisements complied with Spanish law.
These same ads were previously censored by another Spanish court, a decision which Ryanair appealed to the 
Constitutional Court of Spain. "The Court finally upheld Ryanair's right to defend its exclusive distribution policy by 
publicly addressing screenscrapers in terms such as: "illegal sellers", "parasites of the sector" and "dead wood', 
Ryanair said. The Court ruled that Ryanair is not allowed to describe screenscrapers as "bastards". This Spanish 
court victory is yet another milestone win for Ryanair after similar court wins against other screenscrapers in 
Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said. "This Spanish court victory is 
another milestone in Ryanair's fight against internet screenscrapers and resellers. Websites such as Atrapalo have 
for too long been getting away with unauthorised reselling of Ryanair's flights, with the addition of charges which 
consumers don't pay when they book directly with Ryanair."

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Tuesday said it won against 
screenscraper website Atrapalo, as the Commercial Court of Barcelona confirmed that Ryanair is entitled under the 
Spanish Constitution to exclusively distribute its low fares on www.ryanair.com.
Ryanair's Head of Communications Stephen McNamara said, "Ryanair is pleased that the Spanish Court has 
recognised Ryanair's constitutional right to exclusively sell its low fares on www.ryanair.com. This policy is at the 
core of Ryanair's low-cost / low-fare business model and at the heart of our ongoing pro-consumer fight against the 
unauthorised use of Ryanair's website."
The Spanish Court ruled that Ryanair can publicly address screenscrapers in terms such as "illegal sellers",

According to the company, Spanish court victory is another milestone in its fight against internet screenscrapers 
and resellers, after similar court wins in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK.
The company said websites like Atrapalo have for too long been getting away with unauthorised reselling of its 
flights, with the addition of charges which consumers don't pay when they book directly with Ryanair.
Also, the Spanish Court ruled that Ryanair's comparative advertisements complied with Spanish law.
Further, the company said genuine price comparison only websites, who wish to present its low fares information to 
consumers, as opposed to reselling Ryanair flights with additional fees and charges, can enter into a licence 
agreement with Ryanair to provide price comparison only information.
"If Atrapalo is genuinely interested in providing an honest price comparison service, it is welcome to sign up to this 
licence which is subject to a charitable donation of 100 euros," McNamara added.
RYAAY closed Friday's regular trading at $29.41 per share on the Nasdaq.
RYA.L is currently trading at 3.83 pence, down 0.0520 pence or 1.34% on the London Stock Exchange.

Shareholders of Irish drugmaker Elan want to see at least three directors booted off its board, according to a poll of 
298 shareholders conducted by activist shareholder Ib Sonderby.
In answer to the question: "Which three directors would you like to see removed?" 93 percent said Kyran 
McLaughlin; 69 percent said Kieran McGowan; and 44 percent said Gary Kennedy.
Sonderby, who controls more than 2 million Elan shares between his own holdings and those of Danish companies 
on whose boards he sits, has been launching a vigorous campaign aimed at exposing what he and numerous other 
shareholders consider serious breaches of corporate governance.
On Tuesday, Elan revealed that it has itself commissioned an independent review of its corporate governance, 
which is due to be presented to the company's board at its next meeting scheduled for Sept. 15. The company 
commissioned the report in May, according to company spokesman Paul McSharry. But two Elan directors, Jack 
Schuler and Vaughn Bryson do not trust that the investigation is truly independent and were planning a parallel 
probe into corporate governance issues. On Tuesday Elan said it had been granted an Irish High Court injunction to 
prevent the directors from launching their probe. Neither Schuler nor Bryson could be reached for comment. On 
Wednesday, Sonderby will hold a conference call at which point he will reveal a slate of four alternative directors to 
the board. The call-in details are published on Sonderby's website. McLaughlin was appointed director of Elan in 
January 1998 and chairman in 2005. He is deputy chairman at Davy Stockbrokers, Ireland's largest stockbroking 
firm. He is also a director of Ryanair Holdings Plc and director of a number of private companies. Kieran McGowan 
was appointed a director of Elan in December 1998. From 1990 until his retirement in December 1998 he was chief 
executive of the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland. He is chairman of CRH Plc and a director of United

In answer to the question: "Which three directors would you like to see removed?" 93 percent said Kyran 
McLaughlin; 69 percent said Kieran McGowan; and 44 percent said Gary Kennedy.
Sonderby, who controls more than 2 million Elan shares between his own holdings and those of Danish companies 
on whose boards he sits, has been launching a vigorous campaign aimed at exposing what he and numerous other 
shareholders consider serious breaches of corporate governance.
On Tuesday, Elan revealed that it has itself commissioned an independent review of its corporate governance, 
which is due to be presented to the company's board at its next meeting scheduled for Sept. 15. The company 
commissioned the report in May, according to company spokesman Paul McSharry. But two Elan directors, Jack 
Schuler and Vaughn Bryson do not trust that the investigation is truly independent and were planning a parallel 
probe into corporate governance issues. On Tuesday Elan said it had been granted an Irish High Court injunction to 
prevent the directors from launching their probe. Neither Schuler nor Bryson could be reached for comment. On 
Wednesday, Sonderby will hold a conference call at which point he will reveal a slate of four alternative directors to 
the board. The call-in details are published on Sonderby's website. McLaughlin was appointed director of Elan in 
January 1998 and chairman in 2005. He is deputy chairman at Davy Stockbrokers, Ireland's largest stockbroking 
firm. He is also a director of Ryanair Holdings Plc and director of a number of private companies. Kieran McGowan 
was appointed a director of Elan in December 1998. From 1990 until his retirement in December 1998 he was chief 
executive of the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland. He is chairman of CRH Plc and a director of United 
Drug Plc Gary Kennedy was appointed a director of Elan in May 2005. He served on the board of the Industrial

(RTTNews) - Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported its victory in the Commercial Court of Barcelona against 
screenscraper website Atrapalo, which confirmed that Ryanair is entitled under the Spanish Constitution to 
exclusively distribute its low fares on www.ryanair.com.
Also, the Spanish Court ruled that Ryanair's comparative advertisements complied with Spanish law. These same 
ads were earlier censored by another Spanish court, a decision that Ryanair appealed to the Constitutional Court of 
Spain.
The Court finally upheld Ryanair's right to defend its exclusive distribution policy by publicly addressing 
screenscrapers in terms such as: "illegal sellers", "parasites of the sector" and "dead wood". The Court ruled that 
Ryanair is not allowed to describe screenscrapers as "bastards".
This Spanish court victory is yet another milestone win for Ryanair after similar court wins against other 
screenscrapers in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK.
Meanwhile, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said, "This Spanish court victory is another milestone in Ryanair's fight 
against internet screenscrapers and resellers. Websites such as Atrapalo have for too long been getting away with 
unauthorised reselling of Ryanair's flights, with the addition of charges which consumers don't pay when they book 
directly with Ryanair."

You can't fault Willie Walsh for ambition. The British Airways boss has not yet completed the merger with Iberia. 
Some believe that his company's business model is irreparably flawed. He remains at war with BA trade unions. 
And he has a pension deficit of £2.7bn. Yet he has already donned his hat as soon-to-be chief of International 
Airlines Group, as the merged BA/Iberia will be known, and speculated aloud that his new company will emerge as 
a - perhaps the - leader in airline consolidation. He says he has identified up to a dozen acquisition or merger 
targets.
Mr Walsh's comments are premature. IAG won't exist for another few months. They may sound like hubris, but the 
principle is right. The dysfunctional airline industry cries out for consolidation. This is happening at the regional 
level: Air France/KLM, Continental/ United, a proposed fusion of LAN of Chile and Brazil's TAM - and IAG. Investors 
are happy; BA shares are up 20 per cent this year and Iberia's have jumped 36 per cent.
The real prize for any would-be world airline leader, however, is consolidation in the long-haul market, with its high 
share of premium-priced seats. Mr Walsh knows the problems, having failed to merge BA with Australia's Qantas. 
Outside of Europe, many governments still resist foreign ownership. Acquisitions may be easier for IAG in the old 
continent, but the market there is mature and has been hollowed out by the low-cost model of Ryanair and EasyJet. 
For airlines, the real growth is in Asia and Latin America. IAG may yet be able to consolidate its way into getting a 
bigger share in those markets. But Mr Walsh must get his new airline up to cruising altitude before attempting to 
make his grandiose dreams come true.

Ryanair may start flying to Georgia on Europe's furthest eastern fringe, the country's economy minister Vera 
Kobalia has said.
Ryanair is willing to introduce services to the former Soviet republic after Georgia completes building several new 
airports, Kobalia said in televised comments.
The Irish airline may sell tickets for as little as 1 euro, with standard prices reaching about 50 euros, she said.
President Mikheil Saakashvili has said that the government is willing to spend millions of lari to revamp airports and 
build new ones nationwide. "Ryanair has a policy of never commenting on rumor or speculation as Ryanair is in 
discussion with over 50 airports on an ongoing basis in relation to potential route development," the carrier said in 
an e-mail statement via its public relations firm. In further news, Ryanair will operate 14 routes from Bratislava in 
Slovakia during the upcoming winter season, according to a local report. The winter timetable will be in place from 
November 2010 to March 2011. Flights to Alicante and Stockholm will be maintained and the number of flights to 
Brussels and Dublin will be increased. "Eleven weekly flights to London Stansted and a daily link with Milan are on 
offer, too," Ryanair stated. Meanwhile, Ryanair has threatened to pull a number of flights it operates from Shannon 
unless a 33pc rise in passenger charges confirmed this week is reversed. Shannon Airport director Martin Moroney 
said that the rise was essential as the facility was loss-making and needed to improve its viability. The increase, 
which would add 1.58 euro to bring a single-trip passenger fee to 6.30 euro, was the first in six years at the airport, 
according to the representative. This would bring the charge in line with prices at other regional airports such as 
Cork and Knock. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called on the Department of Transport to intervene and 
force the reversal of the price increase.

It said the expansion will help reverse declining traffic at El Prat airport which fell by three million passengers in 
2009. Ryanair's El Prat routes will sustain over 2,500 local jobs as well as 400 direct Ryanair jobs among pilots, 
cabin crew and engineers, it said.
Ryanair will operate over 400 weekly low fare flights to/from Barcelona El Prat in an investment of over USD550

Ryanair leaving Belfast, blasts Ulster govt delays
Ryanair leaving Belfast, blasts Ulster govt delays

Dateline: DUBLIN 
Body
Europe-leading budget airline Ryanair announced Tuesday it's quitting operations from Belfast and, in a tirade from 
the boss, blamed the Northern Ireland government for failing to extend the runway.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said his airline was not prepared "to beat our head against the bloody wall 
for more than three years" while waiting for the runway at George Best Belfast City Airport to be lengthened.
Owners of the airport on Belfast's east side have been hoping since 2008 to extend the runway by about one 
quarter to 2,500 meters (8,200 feet) so that it will be long enough to permit full-capacity flights between the Northern 
Ireland capital and continental Europe.
The current shorter runway requires airlines to stick to lower fuel levels and passenger loads, limiting Ryanair to 
flights to neighboring Britain.
The Catholic-Protestant government has repeatedly delayed approval for the extension, citing the need for lengthy 
public consultations because the airport is near densely populated neighborhoods.
Anti-airport activists warn that the runway, if extended, would allow larger aircraft and mean more jet noise. Airport 
authorities insist the frequency of flights and types of aircraft wouldn't change, only the volume of passengers and 
fuel.
"If Belfast doesn't want it and the authorities up here don't recognize that Ryanair wants to invest in Belfast ... then 
to hell with you," O'Leary told a Belfast press conference.
He said the Dublin-based airline, which frequently threatens to cut services in a bid to win better rates and services 
from airport authorities, would stop flying from Belfast City on Oct. 31. The airline currently links Belfast to five 
British cities chiefly in competition with British budget carrier easyJet, which has much more extensive operations in 
Northern Ireland.
O'Leary said the pullout would cost 50 Ryanair employees their jobs. He claimed Ryanair's presence propped up 
1,000 other jobs in Northern Ireland, a figure that government officials and analysts described as exaggerated.

"We want to grow at Belfast City Airport. We want to offer European flights, but the politicians are blocking us," he 
said, adding that Ryanair would return if the runway is lengthened.
The "very modest" extension would "allow us to do nothing other than fly safely from Belfast City to continental 
Europe," he said.
EasyJet accused Ryanair of bullying behavior and said it supports the government's slow canvassing of public 
opinion. It said the Northern Ireland capital already has sufficient capacity for air traffic, because the city also has 
Belfast International, a less conveniently located airport with two bigger runways.
"Once again, Ryanair wants the red carpet rolled out for them, while easyJet and many other airlines are happy to 
fly from City Airport as it is today," said Ali Gayward, easyJet's commercial manager in Northern Ireland. EasyJet 
operates from both Belfast airports.

Ryanair today said it would close its Belfast City Airport base at the end October because of further delays to the 
building of a runway extension.
The no-frills airline said the decision was made following the airport's confirmation that the public inquiry into the 
promised runway extension will be further delayed.
"Ryanair regrets that despite repeated promises, the runway extension at Belfast City, which was originally 
scheduled to be delivered in 2008, still has not been approved by the Northern Ireland Government, and would now 
be the subject of a delayed public inquiry, which means the runway extension will not be delivered until 2012 at the 
earliest, some 4 years after it was originally promised," it said.
Ryanair, which launched a base in Belfast City in Oct 2007, operates five routes to the UK because of the short 
runway at Belfast City. It said it had planned to open up a wide range of low fare European routes from/to Belfast 
City once the promised runway extension was delivered, but this has failed to materialise. "Today's closure of 
Ryanair's Belfast City base means that Belfast and Northern Ireland tourism will lose up to 1 million passengers 
annually," it said. "From early in November, Ryanair will switch its one Belfast City based aircraft to another 
European airport, with the loss of 50 Ryanair jobs (all staff will be offered relocation elsewhere) and the loss of 1 
million passengers annually, which will result in the loss of up to 1,000 support jobs in and around Belfast City 
Airport. Sadly passengers to/from all Belfast airports will now pay much higher fares to travel to/from the UK with 
other airlines."

scheduled to be delivered in 2008, still has not been approved by the Northern Ireland Government, and would now 
be the subject of a delayed public inquiry, which means the runway extension will not be delivered until 2012 at the 
earliest, some 4 years after it was originally promised," it said.
Ryanair, which launched a base in Belfast City in Oct 2007, operates five routes to the UK because of the short 
runway at Belfast City. It said it had planned to open up a wide range of low fare European routes from/to Belfast 
City once the promised runway extension was delivered, but this has failed to materialise. "Today's closure of 
Ryanair's Belfast City base means that Belfast and Northern Ireland tourism will lose up to 1 million passengers 
annually," it said. "From early in November, Ryanair will switch its one Belfast City based aircraft to another 
European airport, with the loss of 50 Ryanair jobs (all staff will be offered relocation elsewhere) and the loss of 1 
million passengers annually, which will result in the loss of up to 1,000 support jobs in and around Belfast City 
Airport. Sadly passengers to/from all Belfast airports will now pay much higher fares to travel to/from the UK with 
other airlines."

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) announced that it would close its Belfast 
City Airport base at the end of the current summer schedule on 31 October 2010, following the airport's 
confirmation that the public inquiry into the promised runway extension will be further delayed, thereby delaying yet 
again the launch of Ryanair low fare flights from Belfast City Airport to destinations all over Europe.
Ryanair said that the runway extension at Belfast City still has not been approved by the Northern Ireland 
Government, and would now be the subject of a delayed public inquiry, which means the runway extension will not 
be delivered until 2012 at the earliest, some 4 years after it was originally promised. The runway extension at 
Belfast City was originally scheduled to be delivered in 2008.
The airline noted that it would switch its one Belfast City based aircraft to another European airport from early in 
November, with the loss of 50 Ryanair jobs and the loss of 1 million passengers annually. The airline also said that 
all staff will be offered relocation elsewhere in the UK or Europe. The airline also stated that the relocation will result 
in the loss of up to 1,000 support jobs in and around Belfast City Airport.

Brazil's third largest airline, Webjet, is believed to have resumed negotiations with Ryanair about the sale of a stake 
in the Brazilian carrier pending Congressional action to raise Brazil's foreign ownership ceiling from its current 20% 
to 49%. Talks were launched in September 2009, but suspended earlier this year in view of voting delays following 
Senate approval to lift the foreign ownership ceiling. However, with Congressional approval, the measure is 
expected to come into law by year-end or in the first quarter of 2011. Webjet's 20-strong fleet of Boeing 737-300s is 
expected to undergo changes next year with plans to replace its 16 leased aircraft with a mix of 737-700 and -800s.

A lobby group made up of the four biggest airline using Dublin Airport has disbanded, claiming that neither the 
regulator nor the Dublin Airport Authority had listened to them.
The Dublin Airport Consultation Committee was set up by Aer Arann, Aer Lingus, CityJet and Ryanair last 
December with the aim of lobbying to have airline charges cut or at least held steady in the face of declining 
passenger numbers.
A statement from the DACC said it had told the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the DAA that the 
committee now had "no reason or purpose to continue" following the CAR's final decision to allow an increase on 
airport charges at Dublin Airport.
It complained late last year that the chief executive of the State-owned Dublin Airport Authority, Declan Collier, has 
repeatedly "refused" to meet it to discuss the planned 41pc increase in passenger charges. "Mr Collier has refused 
to accept any of our invitations, yet has found the time in recent weeks to travel to Kuala Lumpur and Dubai, while 
also devoting time to his position on the board of AIB," Geoffrey O'Byrne White of Cityjet said. The DACC called for 
lower airport charges and the abolition of the tax on airport departures in order to increase air traffic.
