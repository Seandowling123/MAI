Awilco being listed, as it is small and the share has low liquidity.
    SAS was 1.7 lower at 37.3 on news that Ryanair Holdings PLC chose Stockholm Skavsta Airport to be its ninth 
European base. Starting on April 4, Ryanair will allocate up to four aircraft to its new base in Stockholm, operating

industry's executive committee rejected the AGVU technical committee work group's proposal to use Tomra's drinks 
cans and bottle deposit scheme system. The executive committee also rejected the systems proposed by Deutsche 
Pfand AG, VfW AG and Trinkpack AG and analysts said a clarification of the issue may not be in place before early

wholly owned subsidiaries Vestas - International Wind Technology AS and Vestas Deutschland GmbH.

    Vestas Wind Systems and NEG Micon were both downgraded to 'sell' from 'hold' by Danske Equities after last 
week's marked earnings downgraded from NEG Micon.
    Danske Equities said the earnings downgrade is expected to further contribute to the pessimistic market's 
negative expectations for the industry and added there is an increased need for transparency and positive news for 
the two wind turbine producers.
    Sydbank also cut its stance on NEG Micon to 'sell' from 'buy' and reduced its target price to 65-70 dkr form 225-
245 dkr after last week's downgrade.

Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary said he sees the European Commission coming to a 
decision in the next two weeks on its investigation into state aid at Charleroi, Belgium airport.
    Speaking at a news conference, O'Leary said he sees major European flag carrier airlines filing further 
complaints over state aid and other issues at airports where Ryanair is operating.
    The commission "will decide in the next couple of weeks. Then we have a month to make a formal reply. The 
complaint is against the Belgian state. We are very confident the case will not be successful," he said.
    "The EU is not aware of all the facts. It is inconceivable that they will make a finding that increases the costs of 
the airport or leads to Ryanair increasing its fares," he said.
    O'Leary said the case will not find illegal state aid to the airport because only 7 pct of cases dealt with by the 
commission are proven, and because Charleroi is acting as a private investor in boosting its airport and its low 
costs are open to all airlines.
    The Charleroi case stems from a complaint by Brussels' Zaventem airport, he said, noting that other complaints 
have been filed by Air France, Lufthansa and SAS, and Alitalia SpA against Ryanair.
    "We have got so big, we have got a lot of enemies. (But) regulators and politicians can't be seen to be forcing 
consumers to pay higher prices," he said.
 Air France is complaining about Ryanair's costs at Strasbourg airport, while Lufthansa is planning a complaint in 
two weeks over low costs at another airport, he said.
    Alitalia has complained informally about Ryanair at Bergamo, he said, noting a previous Alitalia complaint on 
unfair publicity rejected by the Italian authorities last year.

(Updating with further O'Leary comments on Italy, next hub)
     Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary reiterated that net profit in the full year to 31 March will 
reach 230 mln eur.
    O'Leary was speaking at a news conference where he offered 100,000 free tickets from Ryanair's new base at 
Bergamo, northeast of Milan.
    "The financial result is going obscenely well. In the first half we announced revenue up 50 pct and profit up 71 pct 
and increased the guidance for the full year to 230 mln eur," he said.
    "The latest December passenger figures were up 64 pct and we are still on target to hit the revised 230 mln eur. 
The year is in the bag now," he said.
    O'Leary said sales in the full year are expected to reach 840 mln eur.
    Passenger numbers in the calendar year 2003 are expected to reach 20 mln, up from 15-16 mln in 2002, making 
Ryanair the fourth largest airline in Europe after Lufthansa AG, British Airways PLC and Groupe Air France, he 
said.
    The 100,000 free tickets for flights on six routes from Bergamo have to be reserved by the end of Thursday this 
week on the internet and are for flights from Feb 6 to March 31, he said.
    The offer is justified because of the level of bookings already made for new flights from Bergamo, starting Feb 6, 
he said, noting that the first month's flights to Barcelona and Paris are already 50 pct booked.
 "With this rate of bookings, we will sell 75 pct of seats taken in the first month. The breakeven is less than 50 pct," 
he said.
    O'Leary said he defended calling the Bergamo airport Ryanair's Milan base because the airport is 45 km from 
Milan centre, while Milan's Malpensa airport, used by Alitalia SpA, is 60 km away.
    Fares on similar routes from Malpensa to those to be served by Ryanair from Bergamo have fallen since 
Ryanair's arrival at Bergamo, he said.
    "On the two routes from (Bergamo so far) to London, Ryanair has forced down prices. You will see on the next 
six routes (from Bergamo) that prices will come down on same services from Malpensa," he said.
Ryanair reiterates sees FY net 230 mln eur - UPDATE
    On launching domestic Italian flights, he said this will not happen this year and that the focus will remain on 
international routes.
    "By the summer of 2004, we hope to have a second base in Italy. Then we start to fly domestic routes. But I 
would be surprised if when we fly 40-50 routes, more than two to three will be in Italy," he said.
    Flights from the north to the south of Italy, or to the islands of Sardinia or Sicily, are "more interesting" than Milan 
to Rome, he said.
    "We have a problem in getting low costs in airports in the south," he said, noting one deal with a south Italy 
airport broke down after six months.
    "Big airlines can have very fashionable routes. We want to open up unfashionable ones and make them 
fashionable," he said.
    Ryanair expects to announce the location of its next European hub at the end of January/early February from a 
choice of two Italian, two German, two Swedish and two UK locations, he said.
    "It is likely to be a choice between Scandinavia and Germany," he said.
    On fuel costs, Ryanair has bought or hedged forward its fuel needs up to the end of December 2003 at a price 
about 40 pct below the current spot market price, he said.
    On a Dutch newspaper report on cooperation with KLM's Buzz low cost operator, he said there are no plans for 
cooperation beyond lobbying regulators on common low cost airline issues.
    "We are talking with them about setting up a low fare airline representative body. That is the only cooperation. 
Talk of shareholder links is taking two plus two and getting 22," he said.
    O'Leary said that with its 1 bln eur of liquidity and low cost base, Ryanair is ready to take on flag carriers that 
want a price war, and which have higher costs and less liquidity.

Ryanair Holdings PLC denied reports of a possible tie-up with dutch low cost carrier Buzz, but clarified that they are 
co-operating on some common issues such as compensation penalties.
    "Ryanair is continuing to co-operate with other European low-fares airlines, including Easyjet and Buzz, on a 
number of common issues of interest to European consumers, such as fixed EU compensation penalties and the 
CAA review of NATS' price increases."
 "Ryanair is actively promoting the formation of an association of low fares airlines to promote such cooperation," 
the airline said.
    Yesterday, Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad reported that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV hopes to combine various 
flights of its low-cost carrier Buzz with Ryanair, citing unnamed sources within KLM.
    Industry specialists were sceptical about the report, with Dublin-based Goodbody's analyst Joe Gill calling it "a 
gleam in the eye of a cash-strapped KLM executive."

Ryanair mulls launching domestic Italian flights
Ryanair mulls launching domestic Italian flights
AFX European Focus

Length: 304 words
Dateline: MILAN
Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC is considering launching domestic Italian flights at the end of this year or next year, said 
Ryanair sales and marketing coordinator Peter Sherrard.
    Speaking at a news conference, Sherrard said Ryanair is aiming for more than 5 mln passengers on Italian 
routes in 2003, against a little more than 3 mln in 2002, as part of a company-wide 35 pct rise.
    "We are looking at domestic routes inside Italy for the end of this year. It could be 2003 or 2004. It is not a 
priority. The first aim is to expand international routes," he said.
    Ryanair is also interested in adding routes to Italian islands Sardinia and Sicily, he said, while another official said 
Rimini has been considered to add to the existing 12 Italian airports.
    The recently opened Milan base at nearby Bergamo airport will operate 30 flights a day from Feb 6 and handle 
1.5 mln passengers this year, he said.
    Sherrard noted that Alitalia SpA has "a big problem" operating its two hubs in Rome and Milan because pilots 
often have to stay in costly hotels, while Ryanair pilots return home each night.
    On group targets, he said the plan is for 35 pct growth in passenger numbers in 2002 and 2003 before coming 
down to a 25 pct annual rise.
    Ryanair sees two low cost airlines emerging after the market stabilises - Ryanair and easyjet, he said, unable to 
give a timetable for this.
 "In Europe, there are so many possibilities of setting up links between the airports where we operate," he said.
    On Ryanair's December 64 pct rise in passengers to 1.307 mln, he said this would not translate into a similar rise 
in sales value, since 870,000 tickets were given away for free.

Cut-price airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it would not confirm a newspaper report it plans to start flights between 
London and Ostende.
    "We will not confirm it.
We are in negotiations with over 50 airports, including Ostend," said a Ryanair spokesman based in Dublin.
    "No deal is in place and we would not confirm it until a deal is in place because of the competitive nature of our 
business," he added.
    According to Belgian financial daily Le Soir, citing government sources and airport officials, Ryanair is about to 
bring on the route.
    Johan Vande Lanotte, the vice-Prime Minister and Budget Minister, told the paper that negotiations are in the 
final stage and that he is waiting for a written proposition from the company. Only minor points remain to be 
negotiated.
    Ryanair will advertise the Belgian destination as Ostende-Bruges since the airport is around 30 km between each 
town. It hopes to carry 100,000 passengers per year.
    Ryanair runs four flights a day between London Stansted airport and Charleroi in Belgium. The airline claims it 
has the busiest route to Belgium from the UK.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said its passenger traffic in December was up 64 pct year-on-year and this strong growth will 
continue into January.
 The load factor for December was 85 pct compared with 77 pct in December 2001.
    Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary reemphasised that rapid traffic growth was planned in the third and 
fourth quarters of 2002 as a direct consequence of significantly lower air fares and yields.
    He said the company's business continues to grow as forecast, therefore this traffic growth in December does not 
give rise to any change - positive or negative - to the board's previous guidance.
