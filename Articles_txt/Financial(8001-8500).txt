Ryanair has cancelled 12 of its UK domestic and international routes after a disagreement with the UK's regulator 
that the carrier said left operation "impossible" ahead of Brexit.
The low-cost Irish carrier secured an operating licence for its UK subsidiary nearly two years ago to allow it to keep 
UK traffic rights and protect its operations from January 1 when the Brexit transition period ends.
The aim was to ensure it could continue to fly inside the UK, and to countries outside the EU such as Morocco. But 
Ryanair said the Civil Aviation Authority introduced regulatory barriers on Sunday evening, just 10 days before the 
transition ends. The airline did not elaborate, but the CAA said Ryanair was planning to use leased, foreignowned 
aircraft on its UK operations. "It has been our longstanding position that a UK airline with a significant presence in 
the UK, such as Ryanair UK does, should not rely heavily on using wet-leased, foreign-registered aircraft to 
undertake their operations. Doing so undermines the competitiveness of the UK aviation industry," said the CAA.
Wet leases involve aircraft being leased along with crew, maintenance and insurance.
Ryanair has only one aircraft listed on the UK's register, out of the more than 450 in its fleet. It said the changes 
affect routes from London, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Belfast and Derry. "Ryanair UK had agreed Brexit 
contingency arrangements with the CAA two years ago and cannot comply with its new and impractical 
requirements at 10 days' notice," the airline said.
Ryanair pulls 12 routes in leasing dispute with regulator
The regulator said: "It is incorrect for the airline to state that the UK Civil Aviation Authority has changed its 
wetleasing policy at short notice."
An industry executive said Ryanair had been trying to use foreign-owned aircraft in its UK unit because of the 
disruption caused by Covid-19, leading it to fall foul of the rules.
Ryanair has long been confident it could operate uninterrupted regardless of the outcome of the Brexit talks so long 
as a basic contingency arrangement to keep planes in the air was agreed.
But the issue highlights the potential for pitfalls the UK's separation from the EU throws up for airlines that have 
long prospered from near total freedom of the skies in the EU's single market.

Alaska Airlines Orders More Boeing 737 MAXs
Alaska Airlines Orders More Boeing 737 MAXs

       Alaska Airlines has ordered another 23 Boeing 737 MAXs, bringing its total order to 68 MAXs. The 737 MAXs 
will replace most of the Airbus aircraft in Alaska's fleet, the companies said in a statement.
 Alaska will have 52 options which, if fully exercised, would take the carrier to as many as 120 737 MAX aircraft.
 Boeing's best-selling aircraft 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes killed all 346 
people aboard Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
 Earlier this month, Boeing reportedly conducted its first post-grounding flight with media onboard.
 The Federal Aviation Administration in mid November lifted its 20-month safety ban on the 737 Max aircraft, and on 
November 30, it issued first airworthiness certificate for one of the new Boeing 737 Max jets.
 The new agreement between Boeing and Alaska includes mechanisms to adjust the timing of deliveries to meet 
economic conditions, giving the airline substantial flexibility to manage its fleet in step with network demand, Alaska 
said Tuesday.
 Alaska said it is scheduled to receive 13 planes in 2021; 30 in 2022; 13 in 2023; and 12 in 2024.
 Alaska's 52 aircraft options are for deliveries between 2023 to 2026.
 Last month, Alaska Airlines announced it would expand its commitment to the 737 MAX program by leasing 13 
new 737-9s while selling some A320 jets it had taken on through its acquisition of Virgin America.
 Alaska Airlines said Tuesday that the 737-9 will replace all A319 and A320 aircraft in the airline's fleet to improve 
the airline's overall operational, financial and environmental performance.
Alaska Airlines Orders More Boeing 737 MAXs
 Alaska noted that it will reduce its Airbus fleet to 10 A321neos by the summer of 2023. 
 Alaska plans to begin revenue service with its first 737-9 in March 2021, with five additional aircraft expected to 
begin flying by summer 2021.
 Earlier this month, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) placed a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX aircraft, 
increasing its order book to 210 jets.

Airlines cancelled scores of flights yesterday as a growing list of countries banned travel from the UK, compounding 
the crisis facing the aviation industry after a year of disruption.
Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Hong Kong and India were among those blocking people arriving from the UK in an 
effort to control the spread of a new variant of coronavirus.
Shares in big airlines were among the worst hit during a stocks sell-off across Europe as easyJet and IAG, owner of 
British Airways, led the falls, with losses of nearly 10 per cent each. Lower-cost carriers less exposed to the UK 
market and continental carriers suffered less steep falls, with Ryanair and Air France-KLM each down about 5 per 
cent.
The UK on Saturday placed London and south-east England under strict lockdown, banning all non-essential travel, 
and warned that a new mutation of Covid-19 was up to 70 per cent more transmissible, prompting countries to 
respond with travel bans. Flights were cancelled at airports across the UK, from Edinburgh to Birmingham, as the 
travel restrictions took hold.
There were more than 900 daily flights between the UK and EU countries last week, and data from Eurocontrol 
showed that air traffic was nudging higher prior to the travel bans which began to take hold yesterday. "We'll see a 
significant impact on the network as a result of the new variant in the UK," Eurocontrol head Eamon Brennan said.
Aviation analysts said the rise in festive bookings would have offered a cash lifeline after the collapse in revenues.
Carriers take fresh hit as travel bans spread Airlines
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said IAG and easyJet were facing questions over whether they would need 
more resources to see them through until traffic returns to normal levels.
"Any worsening cash flow trends ... increase pressure on companies to find more liquidity, and if debt capital 
markets remain sluggish, a renewed equity raise may be the only way out," he said.
Paul Charles, whose PC Agency advises more than 30 companies, said about 250,000 travellers would be affected 
if disruption lasted until January 1. Gatwick said 46 flights in and out of the airport were cancelled as of late Monday 
morning. Heathrow was unable to give an update on how many flights had been cancelled.

Airlines cancelled scores of flights yesterday as a growing list of countries banned travel from the UK, compounding 
the crisis facing the aviation industry after a year of disruption.
Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Hong Kong and India were among those blocking people arriving from the UK in an 
effort to control the spread of a new variant of coronavirus.
Shares in big airlines were among the worst hit during a stocks sell-off across Europe as easyJet and IAG, owner of 
British Airways, led the falls, with losses of nearly 10 per cent each. Lower-cost carriers less exposed to the UK 
market and continental carriers suffered less steep falls, with Ryanair and Air France-KLM each down about 5 per 
cent.
The UK on Saturday placed London and south-east England under strict lockdown, banning all non-essential travel, 
and warned that a new mutation of Covid-19 was up to 70 per cent more transmissible, prompting countries to 
respond with travel bans. Flights were cancelled at airports across the UK, from Edinburgh to Birmingham, as the 
travel restrictions took hold.
There were more than 900 daily flights between the UK and EU countries last week, and data from Eurocontrol 
showed that air traffic was nudging higher prior to the travel bans which began to take hold yesterday. "We'll see a 
significant impact on the network as a result of the new variant in the UK," Eurocontrol head Eamon Brennan said.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) canceled 12 international and domestic routes in the UK due to a change in 
Brexit-related policy by the British Civil Aviation Authority, Reuters reported Monday, sending shares over 5% down 
on Monday's close.
The budget airline said its British unit had finalized contingency arrangements two years back with the regulator, but 
the rules were changed on Sunday.
However, the regulator said that it was "incorrect for the airline to state that the UK Civil Aviation Authority has 
changed its wet-leasing policy at short notice."
"It has been our long-standing position that a UK airline with a significant presence in the UK, such as Ryanair UK 
does, should not rely heavily on using wet-leased, foreign-registered aircraft to undertake their operations," CAA 
Consumers and Markets Director Paul Smith said.
Smith said using wet-leased aircraft undermines the competitiveness of the UK aviation industry and the 
effectiveness of the regulatory regime.

4 Airline Stocks Took Off on Vaccine Hopes: Can They Keep Flying in 2021?

Dec 21, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The year 2020, which is 
in its last leg, has been anything but fruitful for stocks in the airline space. Agreed that most sectors were hurt by the 
advent of coronavirus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March, the bitter truth is 
that the aviation industry still remains one of the worst-affected areas in the investment world.Passenger revenues, 
which constitute bulk of the top line for the airline companies, have been drastically low do far as air-travel demand 
took a severe beating due to lockdowns and travel restrictions.The sorry state of affairs can be gauged from the 
International Air Transport Association's (IATA) gloomy forecast for 2020. Per the IATA[1], the industry is expected 
to incur a staggering net loss of $118.5 billion in 2020. Passenger revenues are anticipated to be a mere $191 
billion compared with $612 billion recorded in 2019. This gigantic fall in passenger revenues is mainly due to the 
year-over-year anticipated plunge of 66% in overall passenger demand for the current year.Region-wise, North 
American carriers are projected to endure maximum net loss to the tune of $45.8 billion in these coronavirus-
ravaged times with traffic plummeting 66%. European carriers including the likes of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] are 
expected to incur $26.9 billion losses with traffic sinking 70%. Latin American carriers with the likes of Copa 
Holdings CPA[3] and Gol Linhas GOL[4] are projected to lose $5 billion with traffic tanking 60%. Moreover, those in 
the Asia-Pacific area are expected to suffer losses amounting to $31.7 billion in 2020. Carriers in the Middle East 
and Africa are likely to incur losses worth $7.1 billion and $2 billion, respectively, during the current year. 
Vaccine News Buoys Airline Stocks With the pandemic still claiming thousands of lives across the globe, apart from 
infecting many more, multiple medical companies are spending billions on developing an effective vaccine to 
combat the dreaded disease. In this respect, Pfizer PFE[5] and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine won the regulatory 
emergency approval in many countries including the UK and the United States after displaying a high degree of 
efficacy in clinical trials. Following this agency nod, vaccination started in the concerned countries.More recently, 
Moderna's vaccine was also okayed by the FDA for emergency use. It goes without saying that the company's 
vaccine was found to be highly effective in its clinical trials. The Moderna vaccine will be shortly administered in the 
United States.In fact, the positive updates on the above vaccines have led the Zacks Airline[6] industry gain 4.7% 
over the past month, outperforming the S&#38;P 500 Index's 3.5% appreciation in the same time period.The 
principal gainers from the airline space during this period were Mesa Air Group MESA[7], American Airlines AAL[8], 
Spirit Airlines SAVE[9] and United Airlines UAL[10], all currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[11]. The price performance of the stocks over the 
4 Airline Stocks Took Off on Vaccine Hopes: Can They Keep Flying in 2021?
past month is given in the chart below. Will the Uptick Continue in 2021? The year 2021 is expected to be brighter 
for the airlines in view of the above vaccines and many more in various stages of development. The availability of 
the vaccines is a major boost to the airline companies, which are pinning hopes on people's return to air travel, 
once vaccinated, as there will be no fear of infection looming on. This, in turn, should boost passenger 
revenues.Another encouraging development for the airlines is the agreement reached by the U.S. Congress to 
approve $900 billion for a fresh coronavirus-relief package. The tentative deal inked yesterday comes after months 
of negotiations following the expiry of the CARES Act on Sep 30.The new package includes a $15-billion grant to 
the U.S. airlines toward new payroll assistance, per a BNN Bloomberg report[12]. Notably, carriers like American 
Airlines and United Airlines shrunk their respective workforces due to the suppressed demand scenario following 
the expiry of the CARES Act on Sep 30. Now the new payroll aid allows them to call back the laid-off 
employees.Apart from the upbeat news on the airline jobs front, that 2021 is likely to see an improvement for the 
aviation industry compared to 2020 can be gauged from IATA's bullish forecast. Total loss for the industry is 
envisioned to come down to $38.7 billion next year. IATA anticipates 2.8 billion people taking to the skies in 2021, 
one billion more than the current-year expectation. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is likely to surge to 
72.7% next year from the projection of 65.5% for 2020.Even though passenger revenues are unlikely to return to 
the pre-coronavirus levels in 2021 itself, we expect the stocks in the airline domain to have a much better time next 
year owing to the aforementioned tailwinds. Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2021 In addition to the stocks discussed

How Irish is Norwegian Air Shuttle? An Irish judge wanted to know last week. Enough to grant protection from 
creditors, it seems. A few weeks earlier the Norwegian government was asking the low-cost airline how Norwegian 
it really was. Not enough to get a second bailout was the government's conclusion.
The nationality of a company can often seem unimportant. Businesses are founded in one country, move to a 
second and can list on the stock exchange in a third, all while their main business could be in a fourth.
But as Norwegian and others have discovered in recent months, when things go badly, nationality can suddenly 
become very important.
The airline started life almost three decades ago as a regional Norwegian carrier. It was in this country that it took 
steps first to become a low-cost challenger to SAS in Scandinavia and then a rival to Ryanair and easyJet in much 
of the rest of Europe.
High-cost, heavily unionised Norway does not seem the ideal country from which to launch a low-cost airline. And 
so it proved, as Norwegian set up subsidiaries in Ireland for operations and aircraft financing and also in UK for 
operations, as well as countries such as Spain, Denmark and Sweden for staffing.
Norwegian Air woes reveal hazy status of corporate nationality INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Hubris then appeared to strike. It started regional flights in Argentina at the same time as it tried to crack the 
lucrative transatlantic market, something no low-cost carrier had ever managed. Soon, rivals, analysts and bankers 
were forecasting a humbling as its rapid expansion led to an equally rapid growth in debt.
Norwegian entered the Covid-19 pandemic as one of the most heavily leveraged of large airlines in Europe and, 
despite a first, limited bailout from Oslo, it was clear that surviving this winter was going to be an almighty 
challenge.
Norwegian is undoubtedly an important airline in Norway and many away from Oslo remember the days of an SAS 
monopoly and the high ticket prices that came with that. But Norwegian politicians were hesitant to back it further, 
worrying not just over its high debt load but also whet- her it was sufficiently Norwegian.
'Very little has Norwegian in few years. Do support them they are called "I feel like they have the name, but very 
little else has been Norwegian in the past few years. The crew are Danish or Spanish or British. Do we have to 
support them just because they are called Norwegian?" one opposition politician told me this autumn.
The government concluded no. Weeks later though, Irish judge Michael Quinn was asking Norwegian to justify its 
Irish nature. Lawyers for the airline pointed to bases in the country for both Norwegian Air International, which it 
used for flights from the UK and Ireland to the US, and Arctic Aviation Asset, the group's financing arm. The judge 
was satisfied, and the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection was unleashed. A day later, the 
company filed for a reconstruction under Norwegian law as well.
It is not just Norwegian that has confused nationality in the Nordics. Ikea is often described as a Swedish retailer.
But its two main headquarters have not been in Sweden for more than four decades, even if it retains a strong 
presence there. They moved first to Denmark, and then the Netherlands. The two main parts of the flat-pack 
furniture empire are based in Leiden and Delft, and owned by Dutch and Liechtenstein foundations. Tax clearly 
played a role, but so did the demand of founder Ingvar Kamprad that they be protected from takeover and banks, 
hence the foundation owners designed to give Ikea "eternal life".
Does it matter to those that buy meatballs in stores clad in the colours of the Swedish flag or to people flying in 
planes with Thor Heyerdahl or Roald Dahl on the tail fins? Perhaps not, but it may surprise them and, at the 
margins, affect their view of the brand and its desirability.
Still, companies have to be aware of the downsides of being too rootless, especially when times are tough. The 
centre-left Norwegian politician said: "Theresa May [former UK prime minister] talked of citizens of nowhere; I'm 
worried some companies are like that."
Norwegian has now bought itself time through the tricky winter season to try to restructure its debts and sell some 
aircraft in the hope of becoming a leaner, more viable airline. Meanwhile, for those in Norway worried that not 
backing Norwegian could lead to less competition, help has arrived. Hungary's Wizz Air is offering flights between 
Oslo and Tromso at an even lower price.

Norwegian is undoubtedly an important airline in Norway and many away from Oslo remember the days of an SAS 
monopoly and the high ticket prices that came with that. But Norwegian politicians were hesitant to back it further, 
worrying not just over its high debt load but also whet- her it was sufficiently Norwegian.
'Very little has Norwegian in few years. Do support them they are called "I feel like they have the name, but very 
little else has been Norwegian in the past few years. The crew are Danish or Spanish or British. Do we have to 
support them just because they are called Norwegian?" one opposition politician told me this autumn.
The government concluded no. Weeks later though, Irish judge Michael Quinn was asking Norwegian to justify its 
Irish nature. Lawyers for the airline pointed to bases in the country for both Norwegian Air International, which it 
used for flights from the UK and Ireland to the US, and Arctic Aviation Asset, the group's financing arm. The judge 
was satisfied, and the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection was unleashed. A day later, the 
company filed for a reconstruction under Norwegian law as well.
It is not just Norwegian that has confused nationality in the Nordics. Ikea is often described as a Swedish retailer.
But its two main headquarters have not been in Sweden for more than four decades, even if it retains a strong 
presence there. They moved first to Denmark, and then the Netherlands. The two main parts of the flat-pack 
furniture empire are based in Leiden and Delft, and owned by Dutch and Liechtenstein foundations. Tax clearly 
played a role, but so did the demand of founder Ingvar Kamprad that they be protected from takeover and banks, 
hence the foundation owners designed to give Ikea "eternal life".
Does it matter to those that buy meatballs in stores clad in the colours of the Swedish flag or to people flying in 
planes with Thor Heyerdahl or Roald Dahl on the tail fins? Perhaps not, but it may surprise them and, at the 
margins, affect their view of the brand and its desirability.
Still, companies have to be aware of the downsides of being too rootless, especially when times are tough. The 
centre-left Norwegian politician said: "Theresa May [former UK prime minister] talked of citizens of nowhere; I'm 
worried some companies are like that."
Norwegian has now bought itself time through the tricky winter season to try to restructure its debts and sell some 
aircraft in the hope of becoming a leaner, more viable airline. Meanwhile, for those in Norway worried that not 
backing Norwegian could lead to less competition, help has arrived. Hungary's Wizz Air is offering flights between 
Oslo and Tromso at an even lower price.

Norwegian Air woes reveal hazy status of corporate nationality

How Irish is Norwegian Air Shuttle? An Irish judge wanted to know last week. Enough to grant protection from 
creditors, it seems.
A few weeks earlier the Norwegian government was asking the low-cost airline how Norwegian it really was. Not 
enough to get a second bailout was the government's conclusion.
The nationality of a company can often seem unimportant. Businesses are founded in one country, move to a 
second and can list on the stock exchange in a third, all while their main business could be in a fourth.
But as Norwegian and others have discovered in recent months, when things go badly, nationality can suddenly 
become very important.
The airline started life almost three decades ago as a regional Norwegian carrier. It was in this country that it took 
steps first to become a low-cost challenger to SAS in Scandinavia and then a rival to Ryanair and easyJet in much 
of the rest of Europe.
High-cost, heavily unionised Norway does not seem the ideal country from which to launch a low-cost airline. And 
so it proved, as Norwegian set up subsidiaries in Ireland for operations and aircraft financing and also in UK for 
operations, as well as countries such as Spain, Denmark and Sweden for staffing.
Norwegian Air woes reveal hazy status of corporate nationality
Hubris then appeared to strike. It started regional flights in Argentina at the same time as it tried to crack the 
lucrative transatlantic market, something no low-cost carrier had ever managed. Soon, rivals, analysts and bankers 
were forecasting a humbling as its rapid expansion led to an equally rapid growth in debt.
Norwegian entered the Covid-19 pandemic as one of the most heavily leveraged of large airlines in Europe and, 
despite a first, limited bailout from Oslo, it was clear that surviving this winter was going to be an almighty 
challenge.
Norwegian is undoubtedly an important airline in Norway and many away from Oslo remember the days of an SAS 
monopoly and the high ticket prices that came with that. But Norwegian politicians were hesitant to back it further,

System for testing travellers overwhelmed on first day; Private providers
System for testing travellers overwhelmed on first day; Private providers

The government's new system of private coronavirus testing to allow travellers to slash quarantine from 10 to five 
days was in chaos within hours of its launch yesterday.
Many of the 12 providers approved by the government admitted they had run out of tests, some websites crashed 
and others were not yet ready to receive bookings.
The "test and release" scheme for travellers was announced last month and was welcomed by airlines as a way to 
encourage travel by halving the amount of time people have to selfisolate after entering England.
But the approved providers were left struggling on the first day of the programme when passengers tried to access 
more information through the transport department website.
SameDayDoctor and The Private GP Clinic, two of the companies, advised people that they were unable to offer 
tests for returning travellers, and were replaced with other companies.
"Unfortunately, we have been so overwhelmed with requests for test and release that we cannot answer any more 
emails nor take any more bookings," SameDayDoctor said.
A link to one provider, Oncologica, diverted people to another called Screen4, whose website crashed in the 
morning - although both sites were running later in the day. The website of Medicspot said tests were not yet 
available to be booked.
System for testing travellers overwhelmed on first day; Private providers
The London General Practice, also on the list, said its website was "currently under maintenance", although it was 
taking bookings by telephone.
Halo Verify said on its website it was offering test kits for £89 before clarifying that they were out of stock. It was 
instead accepting bookings by phone.
Rupert Channing, senior commercial adviser at testing provider Chronomics, said that since the scheme went live, 
demand had been significantly above expectations set out by government.
"Even the most optimistic guide they gave us, this is way outside it," he said. "By 10pm, we had over 3,500 pre-
orders. This morning it has been at that level and higher." He described the line-up of mostly small and unknown 
test providers as "surprising". "It's like a flotilla of small ships," he said.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times he was not surprised by the problems with the 
testing system. "[The government] promised a world-class test and tracing system. All they have delivered is 
worldclass incompetence," he said.
The government said the companies approved were required to meet minimum standards that were higher than 
those recommended for general testing of the population, such as for private sector workforces. Ministers were 
planning to certify larger testing providers who were likely to have greater capacity, one aviation industry executive 
said.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is fond of superlatives, so there was no shortage of them when he placed 
a $7bn order for 75 of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft last week.
"This is not just a safe aircraft ... It is the safest, most audited, most regulated aircraft that has ever been delivered 
in the history of civil aviation," he declared, as he signed the biggest firm order for the ill-starred passenger jet since 
it was grounded after two fatal crashes 20 months ago.
The deal was not the only good news for Boeing, whose credibility is on the line after failures in the Max programme 
led to the deaths of 346 people. Safety regulators in the US have begun to issue the first airworthiness certificates 
to individual aircraft, launching what is expected to be a steady return to service of more than 800 passenger jets 
that had been parked since authorities banned the Max from the skies in March last year.
Gol, the Brazilian airline, told the Financial Times that "a very important milestone" had been passed, as it became 
the first airline to resume commercial 737 Max flights on Wednesday. The return of the Max not only begins to close 
a dire chapter in Boeing's history, it reignites competition in the hottest segment of the aviation market. Boeing's 
European rival Airbus has been virtually unchallenged in the market for single-aisle aircraft since the Max was 
grounded.

while aviation industry struggles with global crisis
"That is important for the industry," said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of one of the world's biggest purchasers of 
aircraft, the leasing company, AerCap. "We have to have competition. We can't have a situation where one 
manufacturer has so much market share that the other one is irrelevant."
The aerospace supply chain, too, is hoping for a boost from the rehabilitation of the Max, an important cash 
generator for many companies.
But the return to service of the Max and Ryanair's order is only the start of a long haul for Boeing and for the wider 
industry, which is struggling to pull through one of the worst aviation crises of modern times.
While big carriers such as American Airlines are also expected to start flying passengers on the Max this month, it 
will be some time before this translates into a flood of new orders from a global airline industry braced for net losses 
of $118bn this year and nearly $40bn in 2021.
Since the Max was grounded, orders for about 1,000 of the passenger jets have either been cancelled or deemed 
too risky to include in Boeing's backlog of roughly 3,300 aircraft.
Even if passenger traffic begins to recover next year after vaccine breakthroughs, airlines will have to deal with the 
debt taken on during the crisis before they begin buying in bulk.
Moreover, there is little incentive for leasing companies, which accounted for roughly 40 per cent of all aircraft 
purchases before the crisis, to buy the Max direct from Boeing when airlines are desperate to raise cash by selling 
and then leasing back jets. "We are paying less to airlines than we would have done for the aircraft we cancelled. 
It's the airline that is taking the haircut," a senior executive from a top 10 lessor told the Financial Times.
In the meantime, Boeing's priority is rebuilding passenger confidence through a faultless re-entry into service of the 
Max. The pace of return will be measured and Boeing employees will be on hand to prepare even those aircraft 
owned by airlines for commercial service. "Boeing will want to be very much a part of that process because they 
can't afford to have any issues," said Phil Seymour, president of IBA, the aviation advisory business. "Even 
something that is not tragic will get on to social media."
Boeing expects it will take roughly two years just to clear the 450 singleaisle aircraft that it could not deliver over the 
past 20 months. A further 387 sit in airline hangars and they, too, will have to go through extensive work.
Each one of those jets will have to be pulled out of storage, updated with new software to address the malfunction 
that caused the crashes, and checked for any deterioration caused by months of standing still. Components in 
aircraft that were stored in coastal areas may have suffered from corrosion as a result of sea air, for example, while 
aircraft housed in dry climates such as deserts may have problems with sand or grit.
United Airlines, which has 15 Max aircraft in its fleet, estimates it takes more than 1,000 hours of work to prep a 
single jet for commercial operation. Finally, every aircraft will have to be inspected by safety regulators as Boeing 
has lost the right to self-certification after revelations that it misled regulators on the Max. This right may eventually 
be reinstated, if regulators are confident about Boeing's processes. The return of the Max will affect Airbus too, 
which has seen its share of the popular single-aisle segment nudge 60 per cent.
Even before the Max was grounded, Airbus was scooping up orders for its A320neo and A321 family of narrowbody 
aircraft at a faster pace than the 737 Max.
Now the shadow of a price war hangs over the industry as Boeing seeks homes for the orphan aircraft in its 
hangars and to avert further cancellations.
Boeing and Airbus insist they will not be dragged into one. But industry executives talk of hearing about a deal at 
just $35m for a 737 Max, against a list price of $121.6m and a more normal average selling price of about $60m.
Boeing faces long haul as 737 Max flies again US group must close the chasm that has opened up with Airbus 
while aviation industry struggles with global crisis
Industry executives say Boeing must try to close the chasm that has emerged with Airbus. It is not just about the 
success of the Max programme - the company's reputation and future as a commercial aircraft maker are at stake. 
"At the absolute minimum they have to hold their own and have to do whatever it takes to hold their own because 
Airbus has had no competition in the last couple of years," said Mr Kelly.
"Airlines take a decision on a narrowbody plane every 20 years. That makes it very hard to regain market share. If 
you lose a customer, the next opportunity to flip that customer is 15 to 20 years away."
Some analysts are pessimistic that Boeing will be able to close the gap. Customers are not only seeking more 
capacity in their single-aisle aircraft but they want narrow-body aircraft with the range of more costly wide-bodies to 
help bring down operating costs. Airbus's A321 - a larger, longer-range derivative of the A320neo - fits the bill better 
than the Max, say analysts.
"Will Boeing ever catch up? No," said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst at Bank of America. "While they were fixing 
the Max, their competitor was putting finishing touches on the 321XLR, a very capable long-range narrow-body 
aircraft. It is more capable than anything Boeing has."
Boeing's response to the A321 is the larger Max 10 - due to enter service in 2022. But with a shorter range than the 
latest A321 variants it is regarded by many as less capable.
As for the core of Boeing's short-haul offering, the 170-190 seater Max 8 jet is "a wonderful plane for what it does, 
but it is one plane", said Mr Epstein.
Boeing has no illusions about the challenges but remains steadfastly loyal to its Max family. "We have the utmost 
faith in this product," said Boeing president and chief executive Dave Calhoun last week at the signing of the 
Ryanair order.
The US company is betting that even before any significant recovery in passenger traffic, airlines already operating 
older 737s will want to replace them with the greener Max 8. "You can take any airline in the world and they have 
retired their older 737s earlier than they planned," said Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe. "These airlines will 
need aircraft to replace the retired jets and for eventual growth. They want the Max because it is cheaper to operate 
and helps airlines meet their sustainability targets."
But there are those who believe there will be no change in the competitive landscape without a new single-aisle 
aircraft to take on the A321.
"We are tackling a tectonic shift in market share if Boeing does nothing," said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president at 
Teal Group, the aerospace consultancy. "The A321 is not the optimal version. Its main virtue is that it is alone." Yet 
with more than $60bn in debt and any sustainable cash boost from the Max likely to be two years away, Boeing 
executives are wary of taking another gamble that could cost the company dear.
Engine technology is not at a stage to allow a new aircraft to claim a stepchange in fuel savings. And there are 
concerns that any talk of a new aircraft could scupper the success of the Max, now intricately tied to that of Boeing. 
"If Boeing were to announce a new single aisle plane in the next two or three years, no one would buy the Max," 
said one Boeing customer.
Boeing is expected to try to delay a new aircraft for as long as possible, to allow technology and time to erase the 
memories of the Max crisis. In the meantime, it will be sounding out customers for what their needs might be when 
the market eventually recovers from the pandemic.
"If anyone thinks they know what the market will be like and what airline customers will want in a couple years from 
now, they don't know what they are talking about," said a Boeing executive. "Research continues, but we really 
have to get through the pandemic before we make any definitive statements." Additional reporting by Bryan Harris

be reinstated, if regulators are confident about Boeing's processes. The return of the Max will affect Airbus too, 
which has seen its share of the popular single-aisle segment nudge 60 per cent.
Even before the Max was grounded, Airbus was scooping up orders for its A320neo and A321 family of narrowbody 
aircraft at a faster pace than the 737 Max.
Now the shadow of a price war hangs over the industry as Boeing seeks homes for the orphan aircraft in its 
hangars and to avert further cancellations.
Boeing and Airbus insist they will not be dragged into one. But industry executives talk of hearing about a deal at 
just $35m for a 737 Max, against a list price of $121.6m and a more normal average selling price of about $60m.
Boeing faces long haul as 737 Max flies again US group must close the chasm that has opened up with Airbus 
while aviation industry struggles with global crisis
Industry executives say Boeing must try to close the chasm that has emerged with Airbus. It is not just about the 
success of the Max programme - the company's reputation and future as a commercial aircraft maker are at stake. 
"At the absolute minimum they have to hold their own and have to do whatever it takes to hold their own because 
Airbus has had no competition in the last couple of years," said Mr Kelly.
"Airlines take a decision on a narrowbody plane every 20 years. That makes it very hard to regain market share. If 
you lose a customer, the next opportunity to flip that customer is 15 to 20 years away."
Some analysts are pessimistic that Boeing will be able to close the gap. Customers are not only seeking more 
capacity in their single-aisle aircraft but they want narrow-body aircraft with the range of more costly wide-bodies to 
help bring down operating costs. Airbus's A321 - a larger, longer-range derivative of the A320neo - fits the bill better 
than the Max, say analysts.
"Will Boeing ever catch up? No," said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst at Bank of America. "While they were fixing 
the Max, their competitor was putting finishing touches on the 321XLR, a very capable long-range narrow-body 
aircraft. It is more capable than anything Boeing has."
Boeing's response to the A321 is the larger Max 10 - due to enter service in 2022. But with a shorter range than the 
latest A321 variants it is regarded by many as less capable.
As for the core of Boeing's short-haul offering, the 170-190 seater Max 8 jet is "a wonderful plane for what it does, 
but it is one plane", said Mr Epstein.
Boeing has no illusions about the challenges but remains steadfastly loyal to its Max family. "We have the utmost 
faith in this product," said Boeing president and chief executive Dave Calhoun last week at the signing of the 
Ryanair order.
The US company is betting that even before any significant recovery in passenger traffic, airlines already operating 
older 737s will want to replace them with the greener Max 8. "You can take any airline in the world and they have 
retired their older 737s earlier than they planned," said Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe. "These airlines will 
need aircraft to replace the retired jets and for eventual growth. They want the Max because it is cheaper to operate 
and helps airlines meet their sustainability targets."
But there are those who believe there will be no change in the competitive landscape without a new single-aisle 
aircraft to take on the A321.
"We are tackling a tectonic shift in market share if Boeing does nothing," said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president at 
Teal Group, the aerospace consultancy. "The A321 is not the optimal version. Its main virtue is that it is alone." Yet 
with more than $60bn in debt and any sustainable cash boost from the Max likely to be two years away, Boeing 
executives are wary of taking another gamble that could cost the company dear.
Engine technology is not at a stage to allow a new aircraft to claim a stepchange in fuel savings. And there are 
concerns that any talk of a new aircraft could scupper the success of the Max, now intricately tied to that of Boeing. 
"If Boeing were to announce a new single aisle plane in the next two or three years, no one would buy the Max," 
said one Boeing customer.
Boeing is expected to try to delay a new aircraft for as long as possible, to allow technology and time to erase the 
memories of the Max crisis. In the meantime, it will be sounding out customers for what their needs might be when 
the market eventually recovers from the pandemic.
"If anyone thinks they know what the market will be like and what airline customers will want in a couple years from 
now, they don't know what they are talking about," said a Boeing executive. "Research continues, but we really 
have to get through the pandemic before we make any definitive statements." Additional reporting by Bryan Harris

Boeing faces long haul as 737 Max flies again; US group must close the 
chasm that has opened up with Airbus while aviation industry struggles with 
global crisis

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is fond of superlatives, so there was no shortage of them when he placed 
a $7bn order for 75 of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft last week.
"This is not just a safe aircraft ... It is the safest, most audited, most regulated aircraft that has ever been delivered 
in the history of civil aviation," he declared, as he signed the biggest firm order for the ill-starred passenger jet since 
it was grounded after two fatal crashes 20 months ago.
The deal was not the only good news for Boeing, whose credibility is on the line after failures in the Max programme 
led to the deaths of 346 people. Safety regulators in the US have begun to issue the first airworthiness certificates 
to individual aircraft, launching what is expected to be a steady return to service of more than 800 passenger jets 
that had been parked since authorities banned the Max from the skies in March last year.
Gol, the Brazilian airline, told the Financial Times that "a very important milestone" had been passed, as it became 
the first airline to resume commercial 737 Max flights on Wednesday. The return of the Max not only begins to close 
a dire chapter in Boeing's history, it reignites competition in the hottest segment of the aviation market. Boeing's 
European rival Airbus has been virtually unchallenged in the market for single-aisle aircraft since the Max was 
grounded.

while aviation industry struggles with global crisis
"That is important for the industry," said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of one of the world's biggest purchasers of 
aircraft, the leasing company, AerCap. "We have to have competition. We can't have a situation where one 
manufacturer has so much market share that the other one is irrelevant."
The aerospace supply chain, too, is hoping for a boost from the rehabilitation of the Max, an important cash 
generator for many companies.
But the return to service of the Max and Ryanair's order is only the start of a long haul for Boeing and for the wider 
industry, which is struggling to pull through one of the worst aviation crises of modern times.
While big carriers such as American Airlines are also expected to start flying passengers on the Max this month, it 
will be some time before this translates into a flood of new orders from a global airline industry braced for net losses 
of $118bn this year and nearly $40bn in 2021.
Since the Max was grounded, orders for about 1,000 of the passenger jets have either been cancelled or deemed 
too risky to include in Boeing's backlog of roughly 3,300 aircraft.
Even if passenger traffic begins to recover next year after vaccine breakthroughs, airlines will have to deal with the 
debt taken on during the crisis before they begin buying in bulk.
Moreover, there is little incentive for leasing companies, which accounted for roughly 40 per cent of all aircraft 
purchases before the crisis, to buy the Max direct from Boeing when airlines are desperate to raise cash by selling 
and then leasing back jets. "We are paying less to airlines than we would have done for the aircraft we cancelled. 
It's the airline that is taking the haircut," a senior executive from a top 10 lessor told the Financial Times.
In the meantime, Boeing's priority is rebuilding passenger confidence through a faultless re-entry into service of the 
Max. The pace of return will be measured and Boeing employees will be on hand to prepare even those aircraft 
owned by airlines for commercial service. "Boeing will want to be very much a part of that process because they 
can't afford to have any issues," said Phil Seymour, president of IBA, the aviation advisory business. "Even 
something that is not tragic will get on to social media."
Boeing expects it will take roughly two years just to clear the 450 singleaisle aircraft that it could not deliver over the 
past 20 months. A further 387 sit in airline hangars and they, too, will have to go through extensive work.
Each one of those jets will have to be pulled out of storage, updated with new software to address the malfunction 
that caused the crashes, and checked for any deterioration caused by months of standing still. Components in 
aircraft that were stored in coastal areas may have suffered from corrosion as a result of sea air, for example, while 
aircraft housed in dry climates such as deserts may have problems with sand or grit.
United Airlines, which has 15 Max aircraft in its fleet, estimates it takes more than 1,000 hours of work to prep a 
single jet for commercial operation. Finally, every aircraft will have to be inspected by safety regulators as Boeing 
has lost the right to self-certification after revelations that it misled regulators on the Max. This right may eventually 
be reinstated, if regulators are confident about Boeing's processes. The return of the Max will affect Airbus too, 
which has seen its share of the popular single-aisle segment nudge 60 per cent.

Boeing suffers more canceled orders for its 737 Max plane
Boeing suffers more canceled orders for its 737 Max plane

Boeing Co. reported more cancellations for its 737 Max jet, which this week is scheduled to carry paying 
passengers for the first time since the planes were grounded 21 months ago after two deadly crashes.
Boeing said orders for 88 of the planes were canceled in November, pushing the total to 536 for the year.
The company reported 27 orders for the plane, although 25 were a new order by Virgin Australia that replaced an 
earlier, larger order for 48 Max jets that was scrubbed, accounting for a majority of the month's cancellations. The 
November figures don't include Irish carrier Ryanair's announcement last week that it will order 75 more Max jets.
Boeing said it delivered seven commercial jets during November, mostly cargo planes to UPS, FedEx, DHL and 
others, bringing total deliveries in 2020 to 118. European rival Airbus delivered 64 planes in November and 477 for 
the year.
An analyst for financial-services firm Cowen, Cai von Rumohr, called Boeing's latest report on orders and deliveries 
“weak on both sides of the ball.”
Shares of Chicago-based Boeing were down less than 1% in afternoon trading. They closed Monday down 27% for 
the year to date, but they have been rising since early November on expectation that the Federal Aviation 
Administration would let the Max fly again. The FAA issued an ungrounding order on Nov. 18 that laid out required 
steps for airlines to resume using the plane, which was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes that killed 346 
people.
On Wednesday, Brazilian airline Gol plans to operate the first flight on a Max with paying passengers since the 
grounding. American Airlines plans the first U.S. flight on Dec. 29.
Boeing built about 450 Max jets during the grounding but was unable to deliver them to airlines — an important 
hitch because Boeing gets much of its cash from sales at delivery. The company planned to hand over the first of 
those undelivered planes to United Airlines on Tuesday in Seattle. United plans to fly the jet to Houston later this 
week and use it to carry passengers starting early next year.
Boeing suffers more canceled orders for its 737 Max plane
On Monday, UBS raised its rating on the shares to “Buy,” saying that the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 will 
help air travel — and demand for airliners — grow faster than expected.

Despite an upcoming return to service, Boeing reported more 737 MAX order cancellations.
According to The Associated Press, the airplane manufacturer announced another 88 orders for MAX jets were 
canceled in November, bringing the total of abandoned orders to 536 for the year.
During the same month, Boeing announced 27 new orders for the 737 MAX, but noted 25 of those aircraft were part 
of an order from Virgin Australia that replaces a larger order for 48 of the previously grounded planes.
Last week, Irish carrier Ryanair announced it would purchase 75 additional MAX aircraft, but that deal was not 
announced as part of last month's financial reports.
In November, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially cleared the way for the 737 MAX to return to the 
sky, as the agency re-certified the troubled aircraft almost two years after it was grounded due to two fatal crashes.
The aviation industry was quick to react to the recertification and the first post-grounding, non-test flight for the MAX 
took place December 2, as the American Airlines aircraft carried members of the media between Dallas and Tulsa, 
Oklahoma.
The first post-grounding MAX flight with paying customers in the U.S. will take off on December 29.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will deploy two B737-800s to Venice Treviso Sant Angelo Airport to cover an anticipated 
surge in demand for business and leisure travel during the Summer 2021 season. The Irish budget carrier said in a 
statement it will use the Boeing jets to operate a total of 45 domestic Italian and international routes spanning over 
20 countries across Europe and the Middle East. Of that figure, 18 will be new services including Alghero, Alicante, 
Frankfurt Hahn, Paphos, Pescara, Riga, Tel Aviv Ben Gurion, Thessaloniki, Trapani. 
Overall, a total of USD200 million will be invested to generate 60 new jobs. Given the impact of COVID-19 on Italy's 
economy, Treviso currently sees no scheduled air services as those that would have been operated this winter 
have been consolidated at Venice Marco Polo. Besides Treviso, Ryanair also has a major presence in Verona and 
at Venice Marco Polo. During the Summer 2021 season, Ryanair said it will operate six routes from Venice Marco 
Polo (four domestic / two international) and will increase frequencies on three routes, including Barcelona El Prat 
(up to 10x weekly), London Stansted (up to 19x weekly), and Palermo (up to 12x weekly). Verona will see nine 
routes (five domestic and four international) with increased frequencies on flights to Birmingham Int'l (up to 2x 
weekly) and Cagliari (up to 4x weekly). Meanwhile, across the border in Austria, Ryanair has confirmed it will close 
its Vienna base at the end of the year with staff offered placements at any of Dublin Int'l, Athens Int'l, or 
Thessaloniki. An internal communique seen by Austria's Aviation Direct said effective January 1, 2020, the three 
B737s Ryanair has stationed out of the Austrian capital will be removed and will be replaced with capacity based at 
other airports as well as aircraft operated by fellow Ryanair Holdings subsidiary Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l). The move 
is part of the Irish LCC's decision to shutter its Lauda (OE, Vienna) subsidiary in October citing its lack of cost-
effectiveness.

Negative

 S&P Global Ratings affirmed Ryanair's (RYA.L) BBB rating, with a negative outlook, as measures by the airline to 
contain costs is expected to partly offset the effects of a slower rebound in passenger volumes amid COVID-19.
The company is making adjustments to capacity, cutting operating costs and limiting cash burn, and completed a 
capital increase of about 400 million euros ($484.6 million) in September.
Operating cash flow for the company is expected to turn positive in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, with an 
improvement in credit metrics consistent with the current rating, if vaccines become widely available by mid-2021.
The negative outlook reflects the expectation that Ryanair's financial metrics will remain under significant pressure 
in the next few quarters and high uncertainty regarding the pandemic and economic recession.

Dec 08, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  FILE- In this Sept. 30, 202, file 
photo, a Boeing 737 Max jet, piloted by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson, prepares to land 
at Boeing Field following a test flight in Seattle. Boeing Co. 
reported more cancellations for its 737 Max jet, which this week is scheduled to carry paying passengers for the first 
time since the planes were grounded 21 months ago after two deadly crashes. The company said Tuesday, Dec. 8, 
2020, that orders for 88 of the planes were canceled in November. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)Boeing Co. 
reported more cancellations for its 737 Max jet, which this week is scheduled to carry paying passengers for the first 
time since the planes were grounded 21 months ago after two deadly crashes. Boeing said orders for 88 of the 
planes were canceled in November, pushing the total to 536 for the year.  The company reported 27 orders for the 
plane, although 25 were a new order by Virgin Australia that replaced an earlier, larger order for 48 Max jets. The 
November figures don't include Irish carrier Ryanair's announcement last week that it will order 75 more Max jets.  
Boeing said it delivered seven commercial jets during November, mostly cargo planes to UPS, FedEx, DHL and 
others. Shares of Chicago-based Boeing were down 1% in late-morning trading. They closed Monday down 27% 
for the year to date, but they have been rising since early November on expectation that the Federal Aviation 
Administration would let the Max fly again. The FAA issued an ungrounding order on Nov. 18 that laid out required 
steps for airlines to resume using the plane, which was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes that killed 346 
people. Later this week, Brazilian airline Gol plans to operate the first flight on a Max with paying passengers since 
the grounding. American Airlines plans the first U.S. flight on Dec. 29. On Monday, UBS raised its rating on the 
shares to 'Buy,' saying that the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 will help air travel   and demand for airliners   
grow faster than expected. Companies Mentioned in This Article Compare These Stocks[1] Add These Stocks to 
My Watchlist[2]7 Tech Stocks To Buy On Sale[3]This too shall pass. Those four words should be taped to the 
computer screen of every investor. If you own shares of the tech sector, you've seen your portfolio take quite a hit. 
Tech stocks were largely immune from the effects of the pandemic. However, as investors are looking to rebalance 
their portfolios, tech stocks were obvious targets for some profit-taking. And at the end of the day, that's what I 
believe the latest tech selloff amounts to. Stocks don't move in one direction all the time. Sure, there may be some 
saber-rattling about breaking up big tech. But with an election in less than two months, nobody will have the political 
will to do anything. That doesn't mean that it's all going to be smooth sailing. Sure, the Federal Reserve did its part 
by promising low-interest rates until the end of time (or at least through 2023 whatever comes first). But the rest of 
2020 is likely to be volatile for stocks. First, there's still the novel coronavirus hanging around. It's not going to 
simply disappear after election day. That will take some combination of a vaccine and/or therapeutic. And all the

likely candidates seem to be getting farther away the deeper into clinical trials they get. And we have an election. 
But we are not likely to know the winner of the election on election night. In fact, for those who remember the 
spectacle of 'hanging chads', this election could make that one look like amateur hour. The bottom line is there will 
be uncertainty. But there are always gains to be found, particularly now that their stock price has come down a little 
bit. Here are seven tech stocks that you can look to add or increase a position in now that they're trading at a

Boeing ( BA ) Gains as Ryanair Orders for 75 More 737 MAX Jets
Boeing (BA) Gains as Ryanair Orders for 75 More 737 MAX Jets

Dec 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing Company 
BA[1] recently secured orders for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes from Europe's largest airline   Ryanair   marking 
the first ever order for this plane since it received flight clearance from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
('FAA'). Naturally this instilled confidence among investors, as is evident from the rise in share price following the 
news.Boeing's shares gained 4% to touch $232.71 on Dec 4 buoyed by Ryanair's order, which thereby boosted the 
airlines' order book for 737 MAX to 210 jets. Boeing's History With Ryanair Ryanair has been one of Boeing's major 
clients since 2014. The airline company placed its first order for 100 737 MAX airplanes and 100 more in late 2014, 
followed by firm orders of 10 airplanes in 2017 and 25 in 2018. The new orders will enable Ryanair to configure its 
aircraft with 197 seats, thus increasing revenue potential and reduce fuel consumption by 16% compared to the 
airline's previous airplanes. Significance of the Deal At a time when the entire aerospace industry is witnessing 
extreme downturn, and Boeing having faced around 460 order cancellations for the 737 MAX jets this year, the new 
deal bode well for the company. This deal will further boost the company's confidence in approaching other buyers 
for the 737 MAX jets. 
What's Favoring Boeing Of Late? The recent orders placed by Ryanair is likely a result of the approval given by the 
FAA last month to Boeing, which now certifies the 737 MAX safe for flying, after series of upgrades to the plane and 
pilot training protocols, and regulatory interventions.The approval, after a long layover of grounding since March 
2019, has bought a huge relief to both Boeing and its customers that operate the 737 MAX jets worldwide. 
Evidently, the company's beleaguered 737 MAX jets, which have been constantly losing orders over a past few 
months, are now showing signs of recovery.While Ryanair has already signed a purchase deal for 737 Max, other 
airlines also seem to be interested in this freshly upgraded plane. Notably, following the FAA's approval, Delta Air 
Lines DAL[2] Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian hinted at possibilities of purchasing Boeing's 737 Max, per a 
Reuter's report[3]. Moreover, Southwest Airlines LUV[4] is in discussions with Boeing for sealing a purchase deal of 
up to 30 737 MAX jets, as stated in a Bloomberg report in November. Alaska Air ALK[5] also announced plans of 
leasing 13 new Boeing 737-9 MAX jets as part of its fleet modernization efforts.In line with such promising 
developments, Boeing remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and delivering the backlog of 
airplanes to Ryanair and its other customers worldwide. This, is turn, should help the jet maker bring its commercial 
business on a positive growth trajectory. Price Performance &#38; Zacks Rank Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) 
company have gained 44.4% in the past three months compared with the industry[6]'s growth of 11.7%. You can

Dec 06, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Virtually all airlines allow you to 
carry a suitcase of certain measurements and weight as hand luggage at no extra cost. Now, the British low-cost 
line EasyJet has changed its policies and will charge a higher rate to passengers who want to use the 
compartments located above the seats. The airline announced that the measure will take effect as of February 10. 
From that date, travelers who do not want to pay for a more expensive ticket will be limited to carrying only one 
small carry-on bag under their seat. The company said the change would help improve flight punctuality, BBC 
News[1] reported. 
EasyJet's new luggage policy raised controversy on social media. Some customers approve of the change, saying 
it would "free up storage space," but many more were critical. 'A terrible move by EasyJet. Like Ryanair, [they are] 
monetizing every opportunity in a race to the bottom. There will be other low-cost airlines that will not follow suit, 
'wrote one Twitter user. Absolutely terrible move from @easyJet[2] to remove their free overhead cabin bags. Like 
Ryanair, monetising every opportunity in a race to the bottom.There  will be other low cost airlines that don't follow 
suit, that will surely make hay with this. - Yonny1975 (@ Yonny1975)December 1, 2020[3] An Internet user reported 
that the conditions of his flight changed, although he bought it before the measure was announced. "I imagine there 
is a small letter in the terms that allows you to do it, but it is not right, right?", He shared in a tweet affected. (Ad)

complete checkup to stray away from these ticking time bombs. This is how the change affects EasyJet passengers 
Currently, all customers can fly with a carry-on bag up to 56 x 45 x 25 cm , allowing them to store small wheeled 
bags in the top lockers. Under the new rules, carrying a suitcase of that size as carry-on will cost extra. Prices 
range from 7.99 pounds (almost 215 Mexican pesos) more expensive than a standard fare, up to 29.99 pounds 
(about 800 pesos) on longer flights. Those who purchase a more expensive Flexi fare or are members of the 
airline's frequent flyer program will be able to bring one small and one large piece of carry-on luggage, subject to 
space on board. EasyJet customers with an existing reservation for travel on or after February 10 who do not wish 
to pay more will be able to check in a larger piece of carry-on baggage in the aircraft hold at no charge.  Airlines 
have been hit hard by travel restrictions during the coronavirus crisis and are looking for ways to cut costs. In 
November, EasyJet reported losses of 1.27 billion pounds (almost 34 billion pesos) from January to September 
2020, as revenues fell by less than half. It is the first time the airline has recorded annual losses in its 25-year 
history. EasyJet expects to fly at just 20% of its normal capacity next year. A spokesperson said the change in

Class Passengers[6] Here are the top travel trends for 2021, according to Airbnb[7] Restaurant Stocks That Still 
Look Tasty As the Economy Reopens[8]As part of our national response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many 
Americans considered it their patriotic, if not moral, duty to support the restaurant industry. And while many 
consumers were intensely focused on their small, local restaurants, the national chains were still open for business 
during this time. And the reality is that the national chains are going to be the most adaptable to whatever pace of 
economic recovery we see. Hopes for a 'V' shaped recovery have pretty much gone out the window. The new 
model suggests a stair-step recovery may be the best-case scenario. The worst case scenario for the restaurant 
industry will be one where different regions of the country are subject to rolling lockdowns. In a business with 
notoriously low margins, an open/close, open/close recovery would be disastrous. It's one reason why I'm not sure I 
would be diving into restaurant stocks right now. But the same was being said of airline stocks and cruise line 
stocks. And sure enough, discount investors have been trying to invest in these stocks. But as all 50 states have 
now re-opened in some fashion, it's not unlikely that restaurant stocks are drawing attention from investors. We've 
put together this presentation that highlights seven restaurant stocks that you should consider looking at if you want 
to dive into this sector. View the "Restaurant Stocks That Still Look Tasty As the Economy Reopens"[9]. [ 1]:

Ryanair orders additional 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft
Ryanair orders additional 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Thursday signed a deal with Boeing for 75 of the manufacturer's MAX-8200 aircraft, 
increasing a previous order for the aircraft from 135 to 210.
The Irish airline said the deal was worth a total of 22 billion dollars.
"Now that the Boeing MAX aircraft has been certified by the FAA to return to service, Ryanair expects to take the 
first deliveries of these new fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft from early 2021," the budget airline 
said.
The order is set to be delivered over a 4-year period ending in December 2024.
The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last week announced Boeing's troubled 737 MAX will be allowed to take 
to the skies over Europe again from mid-January.
The decision follows the green light given to the aircraft by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FASA).
EASA is leaving open a window of four weeks for public comment on its decision, with a final ruling expected from 
the middle of January next year.
The decision follows numerous hardware and software changes and the retraining of pilots on the 737 MAX.
The aircraft was grounded in March 2019 following the death of 346 people in two accidents, one in Indonesia in 
October 2018 and another in Ethiopia in March 2019.
The main cause of the accidents was considered to be faulty control software that directed the jets towards the 
ground. Pilots were unable to overpower the automatic settings.

During the relicensing procedure, EASA acted in concert with the FAA and Boeing, but took its own independent 
decision.

Boeing Shares Surge On Big 737 MAX Order, Global Stocks Mixed
Boeing Shares Surge On Big 737 MAX Order, Global Stocks Mixed

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing 
shares surged Thursday after Ryanair confirmed a major order of Boeing 737 MAX jets while global stocks treaded 
water on mixed economic data. The deal for 75 planes by the Irish low-cost carrier was the first major order for the 
737 MAX since the aircraft was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes. The news, along with a 
successful test flight by American Airlines, help send shares in Boeing higher as the aircraft moves closer to 
returning to the skies after winning approval by US regulators last month. 
Shares in Boeing jumped 6.0 percent, helping to lift the Dow on a mixed day for US equities.  While the tech-rich 
Nasdaq edged to a fresh record, the broad-based S&#38;P 500 finished lower. European equities were also mixed, 
with London advancing and Paris and Frankfurt both pulling back. Data provider IHS Markit said its closely-watched 
composite eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 45.3 points in November from 50 in October, 
according to final estimates.Investors digested data showing slower growth in the US services sector in November 
and better-than-expected new unemployment claims ahead of Friday's closely-watched Labor Department jobs 
report. Markets have also monitored ongoing stimulus talks on Capitol Hill that have lifted hopes of a new spending 
package before the end of the year. "In general, the market is acting rationally in looking ahead to the other side of 
this," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said of the market's strength. But Hogan cautioned 
that stocks could be pressured later this month if rising US coronavirus cases stress hospital capacity, resulting in 
further business shutdowns. "The narrative about how the market is feeling optimistic about 2021 recovery 
prospects because of the arrival of Covid vaccines is growing a bit tired, yet market participants have been given a 
stimulant with the increased buzz on Capitol Hill about the need to get another stimulus package done soon," said 
market analyst Patrick J. O'Hare at Briefing.com. Elsewhere, oil prices advanced as members of the OPEC group 
of oil producers struck a deal to increase production over coming months, but by less than anticipated in their 
previous accord. Starting in January 2021, producers will pump 500,000 more barrels per day. The previous 
agreement entailed a cut of 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd) and had been scheduled to be eased to 5.8 million bpd 
on January 1. Meanwhile the pound surged to its highest level in a year, briefly rising above $1.35, after a 
government official expressed confidence on reaching a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Nancy Pelosi has 
welcomed a bipartisan stimulus proposal that investors hope can break a months-long deadlock with Republicans

Boeing has clinched its first firm order for the troubled 737 Max since it was grounded 20 months ago, with a 
multibillion-dollar deal for 75 aircraft from Ryanair marking the beginning of efforts to rehabilitate both the plane and 
the US aerospace maker's reputation.
After two fatal crashes within five months left 346 people dead, investigations revealed Boeing had concealed 
design flaws from pilots and regulators in a race to get the aircraft certified. The faulty anti-stall system, deemed a 
critical factor in the accidents, has been redesigned and pilots will go through more extensive training programmes.
The Federal Aviation Administration last month declared the jet safe to fly and other regulators are expected to 
follow suit in the coming weeks.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which was already one of Boeing's biggest Max customers, said that 
he was "confident that our customers will love these new aircraft".
At list prices, the order is worth close to $8bn, but analysts expect the Ryanair boss to have negotiated a steep 
discount. Normally, aircraft are sold at discounts of about 50 per cent to catalogue prices but the reduction is likely 
to have been even greater in the current climate.

Mr O'Leary told the Financial Times that there had been a "modest" improvement in the pricing, adding: "It's not 
huge. But every modest reduction you can get when placing an order for up to $22bn, a small discount is a lot of 
money."
But Scott Hamilton of consultancy Leeham said he thought Mr O'Leary had probably got "a really screaming good 
deal" rather than simply a modest one.
The price could have been mitigated by relief on downpayments, on the cost of EU tariffs imposed on Boeing 
aircraft in the battle over subsidies, and "lots of flexibility on delivery slots", said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical 
Research.
Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun said that he had "always had faith the order books would begin to fill" once 
regulators approved the aircraft as safe to fly and the industry recovered.
He also said Boeing's expectations of how long it would take the industry to bounce back from the pandemic had 
shifted following news of a coronavirus vaccine. The timeline to recovery was "a little more aggressive" than its 
earlier three to five-year forecast.
Ryanair's decision to commit to fleet expansion during one of the industry's deepest downturns also signals its 
determination to cement a cost advantage over emerging rivals such as Wizz Air.
Fleet data specialist Cirium noted that more than 1,000 Max orders had been cancelled or judged by Boeing to be 
at risk of cancellation this year alone.
For Boeing, the hope is that the order will spark confidence in the Max, which even before the crisis was lagging 
behind rival Airbus's A320 family in net orders. Investors appeared to agree yesterday, sending Boeing's share 
price 7.7 per cent higher by midday in New York.

Dave Calhoun, Boeing chief executive, said he had "always had faith the order books would begin to fill" once 
regulators approved the aircraft as safe to fly and the industry recovered.
He also said Boeing's expectations of how long it would take the industry to bounce back from the pandemic had 
shifted following news of a coronavirus vaccine. The timeline to recovery was "a little more aggressive" than its 
earlier three to five-year forecast.
Ryanair's commitment to fleet expansion during one of the industry's deepest downturns also signals its 
determination to cement a cost advantage over emerging rivals such as Wizz Air.
Fleet data specialist Cirium noted that more than 1,000 Max orders had been cancelled or judged by Boeing to be 
at risk of cancellation this year alone.
For Boeing, the hope is that the order will spark confidence in the Max, which even before the crisis was lagging 
behind rival Airbus's A320 family in net orders. Investors appeared to agree yesterday, sending Boeing's shares 7 
per cent higher by lunchtime in New York.

Norwegian launches plan to downsize fleet and raise investor cash Airlines

Norwegian Air Shuttle launched an emergency rescue plan yesterday to save the struggling low-cost airline, 
unveiling proposals to downsize its fleet and raise new money from investors.
It follows the filing for protection from creditors last month in Ireland under that country's equivalent of Chapter 11 
as it became aviation's largest casualty of the pandemic.
Norwegian's fate was sealed when the government refused to offer a second bailout, triggering the latest 
proceedings.
The company used Ireland to seek creditor protection as its subsidiaries there hold most of its aircraft.
The company's shares have declined 99 per cent in the past year, wiping out shareholders, as the stock was briefly 
suspended.
Norwegian's board proposed "reconstructing" the airline's balance sheet by reducing the size of its fleet, launching 
a new debt-for-equity swap and a rights issue of up to NKr4bn ($453m) in the form of new stock or hybrid 
instruments.
The debt-for-equity swap, which would be its second of the year, would include aircraft financing liabilities, supplier 
liabilities and bond obligations.
Norwegian launches plan to downsize fleet and raise investor cash Airlines
As part of the proposals, Norwegian said it could also only pay aircraft lessors when it used their planes to help it 
conserve cash, a so-called "power by the hour" deal.
The company gave no details as to the possible scale of the debt-for-equity swap, how many planes it could end up 
flying under the plan or how many jobs are at risk.
The proposals will be put forward at an extraordinary meeting on December 17.
The board said the plan would aim to "right-size" Norwegian's operations at a "level of proven profitability" and 
could attract new investors, including "potentially" new support from the state.
"Even in examinership, Norwegian has lost none of its ambition," analysts at Davy Research said. "The quantum of 
assistance it is looking for is material and, in particular, the request for additional debt-to-equity conversion will test 
creditors' patience."
Ministers in Oslo last month said they did not think it was a "sound use" of taxpayers' money to prop up the airline. 
The carrier went into the crisis as one of Europe's weakest due to a high level of debt built up through an 
aggressive expansion plan, including low-cost long-haul flights. It is operating only a skeleton service in its home 
market, using just six or seven of its planes following a 91 per cent fall in passenger numbers this year.
Founded in 1992 by former fighter pilot Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian grew over the past two decades to become a rival of 
Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways as it expanded from its Nordic base into low-cost travel in Europe and then 
with flights serving the US and Asia regions as well.

Dec 04, 2020( ValueWalk: http://www.valuewalk.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing stock is rallying after the 
company said it sold 75 more 737 MAX jets to Ryanair. The aircraft is set to return to regular service by the end of 
the year, finally bringing an end to a long-running struggle for Boeing[1].  Get The Full Series in PDF Get the entire

Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] The timing couldn't be better because the company is also 
dealing with the impacts[3] of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led many airlines to cancel orders for planes.This 
is the second part of a short series on Michael J. Mauboussin's research document reflecting on 30 years of Wall 
Street analysis published in 2016. Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more The document outlined 
Mauboussin's observations of successful investors throughout his three decades on the Street. This article starts at 
point six. Read More[4]   Boeing sells 737 MAX aircraft to RyanairIn November, the Federal Aviation Administration 
cleared the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to fly again, the company said on Thursday. Wasting no time, Boeing has 
already taken an order for the airplanes from European budget airline Ryanair, according to Fox Business[5]. 
Ryanair placed a "firm order" for 75 more of the airplanes, which will bring the number of 737 MAX jets it operates 
to 210. The airline initially ordered 100 of the jets with 100 options in 2014 and then ordered 10 more in 2017 and 
an additional 25 the next year. Ryanair said its latest order for 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is worth more than $22 
billion. Boeing and Ryanair reached an agreement for revised dates of delivery. Boeing will also compensate the 
airline for costs it incurred due to delays in delivery from the previous orders because the aircraft[6] were grounded 
for over a year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said they expect to receive the first 50 Boeing 737 MAX jets next 
year.Jets returned to serviceBoeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement that the airplane maker 
"remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and on delivering the backlog of airplanes to 
Ryanair and our other customers in the new year." The FAA issued the first airworthiness certificate to one of the 
Boeing 737 MAX jets on Monday, according to Fox News[7]. Boeing plans to deliver about half of the aircraft it has 
in storage by the end of next year. Ryanair ordered the 737 8-200, which has more capacity than the 737-8. Boeing 
has said the airplane allows for more seats and offers better fuel efficiency and environmental performance. 
Ryanair described the airplane as a "gamechanger." The airline configured its 737 jets with 197 seats and plans to 
use them for low-fare service to new European markets as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, hopefully 
returning the travel industry to "normal." [ 1]: https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/09/boeing-co-737-max-design-flaws/

efficiency and environmental performance. 
'Ryanair's board and people are confident that our customers will love these new aircraft. Passengers will enjoy the 
new interiors, more generous leg room, lower fuel consumption and quieter noise performance. And, most of all, our

restore flights and schedules, recover lost traffic and help the nations ofEuroperecover their tourism industries, and 
get young people back to work across the cities, beaches and ski resorts of the European Union,' O'Leary said. 
'Ryanair will continue to play a leading role in our industry whenEuroperecovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and

Boeing climbed after revealing that low-cost airline Ryanair was ordering 75 737 Max jets - the aircraft that was 
grounded after two fatal accidents left 346 people dead.
The Federal Aviation Administration last month declared the jet safe to fly and other regulators were expected to do 
the same in coming weeks.
Shares in the Chicago-based multinational are down more than a quarter this year following its efforts to resume 
production of the Max and the downturn in airline passenger numbers.
Data platform Splunk plummeted after third-quarter results showed a net loss per share of $0.07, missing 
expectations.
Almost every key quarterly growth metric was missed, said UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, commenting on Splunk's 
earnings.
The California group "pinned the blame on a late-October deterioration in close rates, as enterprises hesitated on 
signing large deals given greater cost scrutiny", said Mr Keirstead. "This is consistent with our own field checks."
Forecast-beating results sent CrowdStrike higher.
For the third quarter, the cyber security company reported total revenues of $232.5m, an 86 per cent increase 
compared with $125.1m in the same period last year. Ray Douglas

Dec 04, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Boeing 
Company BA[1] gained about 6% on Dec 3as the low-cost Irish airlineRyanairordered 75 extra Boeing 737 Max 
jets[2] with a value of $9 billion. The news acted as a fresh lifeline to the struggling U.S. planemaker after regulators 
lifted a 20-month safety ban recently.On Nov 18, Boeing won approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to start re-operation of its 737 MAX jet after two fatal crashes (in Indonesia and Ethiopia) that 
caused two years of regulatory scrutiny and corporate chaos.The FAA elaborated software upgrades and training 
changes Boeing must put into effect for the jet to recommence commercial flights after a 20-month grounding[3], the 
longest in commercial aviation history, per Economic Times. The Economic Times article indicated that the single-
aisle jets like the MAX and rival Airbus A320neo are pillars of the global fleet and huge contributors to the global 
industry profit.Ryanairis one of Boeing's most important buyers. Boeing already has an order of 135 of the 197-seat 
Max 200 from Ryanair. 
Ryanair's first jet on order will likely be delivered early next year and the final one by the end of 2024.No wonder, 
the news offered Boeing substantial gains. The airline added about 0.7% after hours on Dec 3. 'This is the 
beginning of the fulfillment of a more robust order book,' Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said at a signing 
event in Washington DC, as quoted on CNBC.To add to this, American Airlines AAL[4] is also 'flying its 
employees[5], including top executives, and reporters on its Boeing 737 Max planes this week' in order to boost 
confidence among the passengers. 'Boeing is also negotiating with airlines includingSouthwestandDeltaandAlaska 
Airlines, which last month agreed to lease 13 Boeing Max jets, industry sources have said,' as quoted on 
CNBC.Against this backdrop, though we believe that the Boeing stock does not offer an aggressive buying 
opportunity even after the FAA approval and Ryanair's order, the hopes of improvement in Boeing business can be 
played via basket approach. The basket approach or the ETF route minimizes the stock-specific risks. Below we

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].Boeing stock is rallying after the company said it sold 75 more 737 MAX jets to 
Ryanair. The aircraft is set to return to regular service by the end of the year, finally bringing an end to a long-
running struggle for Boeing[2].   Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] The timing couldn't be better 
because the company is also dealing with the impacts[4] of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led many airlines to 
cancel orders for planes.Boeing sells 737 MAX aircraft to RyanairIn November, the Federal Aviation Administration 
cleared the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to fly again, the company said on Thursday. 
Wasting no time, Boeing has already taken an order for the airplanes from European budget airline Ryanair, 
according to Fox Business[5]. Ryanair placed a 'firm order' for 75 more of the airplanes, which will bring the number 
of 737 MAX jets it operates to 210. The airline initially ordered 100 of the jets with 100 options in 2014 and then 
ordered 10 more in 2017 and an additional 25 the next year. Ryanair said its latest order for 75 Boeing 737 MAX 
aircraft is worth more than $22 billion. Boeing and Ryanair reached an agreement for revised dates of delivery. 
Boeing will also compensate the airline for costs it incurred due to delays in delivery from the previous orders 
because the aircraft[6] were grounded for over a year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said they expect to receive 
the first 50 Boeing 737 MAX jets next year.Jets returned to serviceBoeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in 
a statement that the airplane maker 'remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and on 
delivering the backlog of airplanes to Ryanair and our other customers in the new year.' The FAA issued the first 
airworthiness certificate to one of the Boeing 737 MAX jets on Monday, according to Fox News[7]. Boeing plans to 
deliver about half of the aircraft it has in storage by the end of next year. Ryanair ordered the 737 8-200, which has 
more capacity than the 737-8. Boeing has said the airplane allows for more seats and offers better fuel efficiency 
and environmental performance. Ryanair described the airplane as a 'gamechanger.' The airline configured its 737 
jets with 197 seats and plans to use them for low-fare service to new European markets as the COVID-19 vaccine 
becomes available, hopefully returning the travel industry to 'normal.' https://mixi.media/ The post Boeing takes

Boeing gets a boost from Ryanair order for 75 more Max jets
Boeing gets a boost from Ryanair order for 75 more Max jets

Irish budget airline Ryanair said Thursday it is ordering 75 more Boeing 737 Max jets, a boost for Boeing just before 
its most important plane returns to flying after two deadly crashes.
The order would be worth more than $9 billion at list prices, although airlines routinely receive deep discounts. 
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Boeing shares rose 6% to $237.20, their highest closing price in nearly nine months.
The announcement was a huge lift for Chicago-based Boeing, which has suffered canceled orders for the plane 
since it was grounded nearly 21 months ago and while demand for new jets plummeted because of the coronavirus 
pandemic.
So far this year, customers have canceled orders for 448 Max jets and Boeing has raised doubt about another 782 
orders because of the airlines’ pandemic-weakened financial health. Before Ryanair’s order, the company had 
reported only five Max orders in 2020.
Boeing CEO David Calhoun said he is confident that the Ryanair move is the beginning of the company's bid to 
rebuild its Max order book.
Airlines usually get deep discounts off list prices for planes. Calhoun dismissed the idea that Boeing may be under 
more pressure to cut prices because of a pandemic that is causing massive losses at its airline customers and the 
Max's own troubled past. The company is trying to resell planes covered by previous deals that were later canceled.
“We don't feel a need to discount our way into the marketplace,” he said.
The new deal would push Ryanair’s total orders for the Max to 210 planes. CEO Michael O’Leary said that with the 
additional 75 planes, Max jets will make up one-third of Ryanair’s fleet in five years, up from 6% now.
O’Leary said the planes offer lower fuel consumption and quieter flying than other aircraft. He expressed confidence 
that travel will recover next year as virus vaccines become widely available and that customers will get back on the 
Max.
Boeing gets a boost from Ryanair order for 75 more Max jets
“The one issue that's going to come up here today is safety, so let's get it out front,” O'Leary said on a call with 
reporters. “This is the most scrutinized, most audited aircraft in history. It's also going to be one of the safest.”
Max jets were grounded worldwide in March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia just five months apart 
killed a total of 346 people. Last month the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and regulators in Europe cleared 
the way for the plane's return by prescribing new flight-control software and other changes.
Brazil's Gol airline plans to operate flights with paying passengers starting next week. American Airlines plans the 
first U.S. flight for Dec. 29 from Miami to New York.
With its previously best-selling plane grounded, Boeing has lost $3.5 billion so far this year and announced deep 
jobs cuts to reduce costs. Boeing expects the pandemic to cast a pall over demand for airline jets for several years.

Midday Report: US Stocks Rise, Dollar Slumps to Two-Year Low Amid Drop in Jobless Claims, Prospect of

 US stocks rose as initial jobless claims fell more than expected and the dollar depreciated to its lowest level in 
more than two years amid expectations of a $908 billion bipartisan fiscal stimulus package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 175.40 points, or 0.6%, to 30,057.56, with the S&P 500 higher by 0.2% 
to 3,674.53 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up by 0.5% to 12,405.34. Industrials and real-estate were among 
the biggest gainers while utilities led the decliners after midday on Thursday.
The US 10-year yield fell by 2.3 basis points to 0.92%.
US initial jobless claims for the Nov. 28 week fell to 712,000, lagging the consensus forecast compiled by 
Bloomberg for 775,000. The four-week moving average slid to 739,500, resuming the string of declines seen over 
the last few months. Continuing claims fell to 5.52 million in the Nov. 21 week, maintaining a downward trend but 
still sharply elevated.
"Prior to this week, claims increased in two consecutive weeks for the first time since July," Analysts Thomas 
Simons and Aneta Markowska said in a report. "It had appeared that the labor market recovery had hit an inflection 
point, but today's data is more encouraging."
The leadership of the Democrats is supporting a bipartisan compromise for the stimulus package, according to a 
report from Commerzbank. The dollar depreciated by 0.5% against the Japanese yen to 103.83.
"Additional fiscal stimulus ahead of the new President Joe Biden assuming office would lower the current downside 
risks for the economy and thus principally fuel inflation expectations, which will weaken the dollar in view of the 
Fed's long-term expansionary monetary policy targets," Commerzbank Analyst Esther Reichelt said.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose by 0.6% to $45.55, after trading lower earlier in the session, ahead 
of a decision from the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia 
in relation to the extension of production cuts in the first quarter. Media reports speculated joint cuts will be eased 
by 500,000 per day instead of 2 million barrels per day to bring on board the United Arab Emirates, the main 
dissenter.
In company news, DocuSign (DOCU) rose 6.7% ahead of the expected release of quarterly results Thursday after 
the bell.  Boeing (BA) topped the Dow with shares jumping 7.9% intraday after Ryanair (RYAAY) placed a firm order 
for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes, expanding its order book to 210 jets.
On the S&P 500, top performers included COVID-19 plays such as Carnival (CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), 
and American Airlines (AAL), with gains of at least 9% each intraday.
In the precious metals markets, gold was up 0.4% to $1,837.40 an ounce, with silver unchanged at $24.08.
Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund rose 0.7% to $31.20 and the United States Natural Gas Fund was 
down 8.4% to $9.13. Among precious-metal funds, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF was down 1.2% to $35.49 
and SPDR Gold Shares were up 0.5% to $172.35. The iShares Silver Trust was little changed at $22.33.

 US stocks ended mixed despite record-breaking intraday gains from the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq as reports came 
in late in the day that Pfizer (PFE) is slashing half the COVID-19 vaccines it was targeting to ship this year due to 
supply chain issues. Last week's initial jobless claims were lower than expected amid expectations of a reported 
$908 billion bipartisan fiscal stimulus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.3% to 29,969.52. The S&P 500 was near flat at 3,666.72 and the 
Nasdaq Composite was up by 0.2% to 12,377.18. Energy and real estate were among the biggest gainers while 
utilities and materials led the decliners on Thursday.
US initial jobless claims for the Nov. 28 week fell to 712,000, lagging the consensus forecast compiled by 
Bloomberg for 775,000. The four-week moving average slid to 739,500, resuming the string of declines seen over 
the last few months. Continuing claims fell to 5.52 million in the Nov. 21 week, maintaining a downward trend but 
still sharply elevated.
"Prior to this week, claims increased in two consecutive weeks for the first time since July," Analysts Thomas 
Simons and Aneta Markowska said in a report from Jefferies. "It had appeared that the labor market recovery had 
hit an inflection point, but today's data is more encouraging."
"That being said, claims data for the week of Thanksgiving is notoriously difficult to process due to issues with the 
seasonal adjustment process. The decline this week is encouraging, but also difficult to trust," they said.
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Democrats is supporting a bipartisan compromise for the stimulus package, 
according to a report from Commerzbank.

Stocks were propped up by hopes for another stimulus package, fueled by Majority Leader McConnell's upbeat 
remarks, and indications that the president will support the latest GOP endorsed package. Although Democratic

S&P 500, Dow Head Toward Third Straight Win as Jobless Claims Decrease, McConnell Sees Stimulus Deal

S&P 500, Dow Head Toward Third Straight Win as Jobless Claims Decrease, 
McConnell Sees Stimulus Deal 'In Reach'

 Stocks gained ground Thursday, as investors kept the Standard & Poor's 500 Index at record highs following a 
decline in Americans filing for jobless claims and after the US Senate leader expressed optimism about crafting a 
new COVID-19 relief bill. 
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were on track for a third consecutive win while the Nasdaq 
Composite was erasing the small loss it logged on Wednesday.
Stocks largely extended gains after the Labor Department early Thursday said weekly filings for initial 
unemployment aid fell by 75,000 to 712,000, the largest decline since early October. An Econoday survey had 
projected filings of 780,000.
Claims in the previous two weeks had increased for the first time since July, suggesting "the labor market recovery 
had hit an inflection point, but today's data is more encouraging," said Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and 
Aneta Markowska in a note. "That being said, claims data for the week of Thanksgiving is notoriously difficult to 
process due to issues with the seasonal adjustment process," they cautioned.
The jobless figures also showed that more than 20 million Americans are still receiving unemployment benefits 
during the ongoing coronavirus health crisis. The US is currently mired in record-high figures for new infections, with 
daily tallies surpassing 200,000.
Senate Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor Thursday reportedly said he thinks a deal is in sight for a new 
round of fiscal stimulus to address the pandemic. "Compromise is within reach. We know where we agree. We can 
do this," he said, according to a CNBC report.
On the Dow, 20 of its 30 components were higher. Boeing (BA) jumped nearly 8% with Irish carrier Ryanair 
(RYAAY) placing a firm order for 75 additional 737 Max airplanes.
S&P 500, Dow Head Toward Third Straight Win as Jobless Claims Decrease, McConnell Sees Stimulus Deal 
'In Reach'
Six of the 11 industry sectors on the S&P 500 rose. The energy group was up 1.4% but slightly pared the gain 
following reports that OPEC and its allies have agreed to begin modestly increasing oil output in 2021.
Among corporate movers, Express (EXPR) shares sank 19%, with the apparel retailer posting a wider-than-
expected adjusted loss of $1.17 per share for its fiscal third quarter. Also, AMC Entertainment (AMC) fell 58% after 
the movie theater chain operator filed a securities shelf registration to sell up to 200 million class A shares. Shares 
may be sold from time to time, it said.
CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) surged 14% as the cybersecurity technology company raised its 2021 financial 
guidance and unexpectedly swung to adjusted earnings in the third quarter.
In afternoon trading, the Dow rose 0.6%, the S&P 500 added on 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Wall Street's 
main stock indices pushed higher on Thursday after Ryanair confirmed a major order of Boeing 737 MAX jets.The 
deal for 75 of the planes by the Irish low-cost carrier was the first major order for the 737 MAX since the aircraft was 
grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes.The news, along with a successful test flight by American 
Airlines, help send shares in Boeing higher as the aircraft moves closer to returning to the skies after winning 
approval by US regulators last month.Shares in Boeing surged 7.4 percent higher.In late morning trading, the Dow 
was 0.6 percent higher, with the S&#38;P 500 pushing further into record territory. Sentiment was also helped by 
movement towards a new stimulus package.Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw her support behind a $908-billion 
compromise virus relief package proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday. The proposal is 
however half what Democrats had previously been pushing for."The narrative about how the market is feeling 
optimistic about 2021 recovery prospects because of the arrival of Covid vaccines is growing a bit tired, yet market 
participants have been given a stimulant with the increased buzz on Capitol Hill about the need to get another 
stimulus package done soon," said market analyst Patrick J. O'Hare at Briefing.com.He added that the continued 
high number of new jobless claims along with more than 100,000 Covid-19 hospitalisations in the US were factors 
in the market viewing it as likely that a deal will be done relatively soon.The eurozone's equity markets slipped on 
survey data indicating the region's economy continued to be battered by coronavirus fallout.In eurozone trades 
Thursday, Frankfurt's DAX 30 index shed 0.5 percent and the Paris CAC 40 dropped 0.2 percent.Data provider IHS 
Markit said its closely-watched composite eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 45.3 points in 
November from 50 in October, according to final estimates.Britain's services PMI dropped to 47.6 from 51.4. A level 
below 50 points indicates contraction.Nevertheless, London's FTSE 100 managed a 0.4 percent gain thanks to a 
good performance by international mining stocks.

rising above $1.35, after a government official expressed confidence on reaching a post-Brexit trade deal with the 
EU."It's the kind of comment that has been heard before in the last couple of weeks, without anything materialising," 
said market analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex. "Nevertheless, with the deadline looming, sterling will take what 
it can get."Oil prices drifted higher as a crucial OPEC gathering debated whether to extend the current level of 
output cuts.New York - Dow: UP 0.6 percent at 30,057.37London - FTSE 100: UP 0.4 percent at 6,490.27 points

The first post-grounding, non-test flight for Boeing's 737 MAX fleet of planes took place Wednesday, as the aircraft 
carried members of the media between Dallas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
According to Reuters.com, American Airlines hosted the 45-minute flight for around 90 reporters, flight attendants 
and other employees, with the energy inside the plane described as "subdued."
While some passengers interacted during the journey using facial coverings and social distancing, the entire group 
cheered when the aircraft landed successfully. Wednesday's flight marked the first time anyone other than 
regulators and industry personnel flew on the MAX since the grounding.
Boeing's737 MAX fleet was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes in five months that killed a combined 346 
people. After a 20-month safety ban, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cleared the plane after approving 
design changes and new pilot training.
"The history of aviation is built around a chain of safety," American Airlines Captain Pete Gamble told Reuters 
before takeoff. "When the chain of safety breaks it's up to those of us in the industry to mend it and bring it back."
The first post-grounding MAX flight with paying customers will take off on December 29.
Despite the previous issues with the plane, United Airlines is expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery since 
the grounding, while European low-cost carrier Ryanair was reportedly set to place an order for up to 75 additional 
MAX planes.

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing shares 
surged Thursday after Ryanair confirmed a major order of Boeing 737 MAX jets while global stocks treaded water 
on mixed economic data.The deal for 75 planes by the Irish low-cost carrier was the first major order for the 737 
MAX since the aircraft was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes.The news, along with a successful 
test flight by American Airlines, help send shares in Boeing higher as the aircraft moves closer to returning to the 
skies after winning approval by US regulators last month.Shares in Boeing jumped 6.0 percent, helping to lift the 
Dow on a mixed day for US equities.While the tech-rich Nasdaq edged to a fresh record, the broad-based S&#38;P 
500 finished lower.European equities were also mixed, with London advancing and Paris and Frankfurt both pulling 
back.Data provider IHS Markit said its closely-watched composite eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell

growth in the US services sector in November and better-than-expected new unemployment claims ahead of 
Friday's closely-watched Labor Department jobs report.Markets have also monitored ongoing stimulus talks on 
Capitol Hill that have lifted hopes of a new spending package before the end of the year."In general, the market is 
acting rationally in looking ahead to the other side of this," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, 
said of the market's strength.But Hogan cautioned that stocks could be pressured later this month if rising US 
coronavirus cases stress hospital capacity, resulting in further business shutdowns."The narrative about how the 
market is feeling optimistic about 2021 recovery prospects because of the arrival of Covid vaccines is growing a bit 
tired, yet market participants have been given a stimulant with the increased buzz on Capitol Hill about the need to

prices advanced as members of the OPEC group of oil producers struck a deal to increase production over coming 
months, but by less than anticipated in their previous accord.Starting in January 2021, producers will pump 500,000

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has firmed options for seventy-five B737-8-200s to increase its total commitment to the 
type to 210 units. The Irish low-cost carrier initially ordered 100 B737-8-200s in 2014, along with 100 options. It 
ordered an additional ten aircraft in 2017 and converted 25 options into firm orders in 2018. It is one of only two 
customers for the variant, the other being VietJetAir (VJ, Hanoi) with a firm order for 28 units of the type. 
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that at least 135 of Ryanair's 210 aircraft, including 129 to be 
operated by Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) itself and six by its Polish subsidiary Buzz (RR, Warsaw Modlin), have 
already been assigned and are awaiting delivery. The -200 is a higher capacity variant of the B737-8, featuring, 
among other modifications, an additional pair of exit doors. In Ryanair's configuration, the aircraft will seat up to 197 
passengers in a single-class layout. The B737-8-200 has yet to be certified as it was not prior to the March 2019 
grounding. The variant's certification aside, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair Holdings' Group CEO and Executive Director, 
said during a 1H FY2021 earnings call last month that the first MAX 8-200 could deliver during early 2021. "We are 
hoping to take the first delivery of those aircraft at the end of - sometime in February," he said. "It would allow us to 
take something of the order of about 30 aircraft between February and early summer. That figure might fall to 25 or 
so, but it depends on when we can get the first one." The entire 210-strong order is expected to be fulfilled by 
December 2024.

Ryanair orders more Boeing MAX-8200 aircraft
Ryanair orders more Boeing MAX-8200 aircraft

Ryanair, has signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-8200 aircraft, which increases its firm 
order for the Boeing "Gamechanger" aircraft from 135 to 210, with a total value of over US$22bn. Now that the 
Boeing MAX aircraft has been certified by the FAA to return to service, Ryanair expects to take the first deliveries of 
these new fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft from early 2021, and has confirmed 210 firm orders 
with Boeing for these gamechanger aircraft, which will be delivered over a 4-year period between Spring 2021 and 
December 2024.
Ryanair, which (prior to the COVID-19 crisis) was on track to carry over 150m passengers last year, will use these 
new aircraft to grow its low fare services into new EU countries and markets, which will incentivize Europe's 
consumers and its travel industry to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, as quickly as multiple vaccines are 
rolled out in 2021, and life returns to normal. Ryanair and Boeing have agreed revised delivery dates, and have also 
agreed compensation for the direct costs incurred by Ryanair over the past 18 months due to these delivery delays, 
although some of this compensation has been factored into a modest reduction in the pricing of this new aircraft 
order which has encouraged Ryanair to increase the firm order from 135 to 210 aircraft.
The Boeing 737 MAX-8200 aircraft is a "Gamechanger" for Ryanair's customers and Europe's consumers. This 
aircraft, when delivered, will be the most audited, most regulated in aviation history. The aircraft performance is 
exceptional, as it delivers 8 more seats per flight, yet burns 16% less fuel, and lowers noise emissions by 40%. This 
new 197 seat Boeing aircraft is the perfect sized platform to allow Ryanair expand and grow its low fare services 
across Europe over the next decade. This new Boeing order helps Ryanair to lower its cost base and return to 
growth across Europe in 2021, by delivering lower fares to customers, as well as a lower CO2 and noise footprint, 
making Ryanair Europe's greenest, cleanest airline, and helping Ryanair reach its target of being carbon neutral by 
2050.
Boeing's President & CEO Dave Calhoun said: "Ryanair will continue to play a leading role in our industry when 
Europe recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and air traffic returns to growth across the continent. We are 
gratified that Ryanair is once again placing its confidence in the Boeing 737 family and building their future fleet with 
this enlarged firm order.
Boeing remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and on delivering the backlog of airplanes to 
Ryanair and our other customers in the new year. We firmly believe in this airplane and we will continue the work to 
re-earn the trust of all of our customers."
Ryanair orders more Boeing MAX-8200 aircraft
Ryanair's Group CEO Michael O'Leary said: "We are pleased and proud to place this enlarged order with Boeing, 
who have successfully completed the return to service of the Boeing MAX aircraft. The Boeing MAX is a fabulous 
aircraft with more seats, more leg room, lower fares, lower fuel consumption, and it sets incredible environmental 
standards, including 40% less noise and lower CO2 emissions.
 We hope to take delivery of at least 50 of these aircraft in 2021, subject to Boeing recovering its manufacturing 
output to deliver them. For as long as the COVID-19 pandemic depresses air travel, we will use these new aircraft 
to replace some of our older Boeing NG fleet, which will remain  grounded until pre-Covid demand returns. But as 
soon as the COVID-19 virus recedes - and it will in 2021 with the rollout of multiple effective vaccines - Ryanair and 
our partner airports across Europe will - with these environmentally efficient aircraft - rapidly restore flights and 
schedules, recover lost traffic and help the nations of Europe recover their tourism industry, and get young people 
back to work across the cities, beaches, and ski resorts of the EU.
We sincerely thank our partners in Boeing, who have worked closely with us over the last 18 months to reschedule 
aircraft deliveries, to provide fair compensation to reflect those costs which Ryanair has incurred through these 
delivery delays and to agree this new enlarged aircraft order. We are working closely with Boeing and our senior 
pilot professionals to assist our regulator EASA to certify these aircraft in Europe, and to complete the training of 
our pilots and crews across our three new Boeing MAX simulators in Dublin and Stansted.
We are extremely grateful to our shareholders who have recently supported a (EURO)1.25 billion fundraising, 
without which we could not have placed this large but very timely aircraft order during a once in a century downturn 
in the airline industry. We believe our people will enjoy flying these exciting new aircraft, which will, we hope, allow 
us to recruit/train many thousands of new pilots and cabin crew over the next 5 years. The Board and people of 
Ryanair are confident that our customers will love these new aircraft, they will enjoy the new interiors, the more 
generous leg room, the lower fuel consumption and the quieter noise performance, but most of all, they will love the 
lower fares, which these aircraft will enable Ryanair to offer not just in 2021, but for the next decade, as Ryanair 
leads a strong recovery of Europe's aviation and tourism industry out of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis."

Ryanair, has signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-8200 aircraft, which increases its firm 
order for the Boeing "Gamechanger" aircraft from 135 to 210, with a total value of over US$22bn. Now that the 
Boeing MAX aircraft has been certified by the FAA to return to service, Ryanair expects to take the first deliveries of 
these new fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft from early 2021, and has confirmed 210 firm orders 
with Boeing for these gamechanger aircraft, which will be delivered over a 4-year period between Spring 2021 and 
December 2024.
Ryanair, which (prior to the COVID-19 crisis) was on track to carry over 150m passengers last year, will use these 
new aircraft to grow its low fare services into new EU countries and markets, which will incentivize Europe's 
consumers and its travel industry to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, as quickly as multiple vaccines are 
rolled out in 2021, and life returns to normal. Ryanair and Boeing have agreed revised delivery dates, and have also 
agreed compensation for the direct costs incurred by Ryanair over the past 18 months due to these delivery delays, 
although some of this compensation has been factored into a modest reduction in the pricing of this new aircraft 
order which has encouraged Ryanair to increase the firm order from 135 to 210 aircraft.
The Boeing 737 MAX-8200 aircraft is a "Gamechanger" for Ryanair's customers and Europe's consumers. This 
aircraft, when delivered, will be the most audited, most regulated in aviation history. The aircraft performance is 
exceptional, as it delivers 8 more seats per flight, yet burns 16% less fuel, and lowers noise emissions by 40%. This 
new 197 seat Boeing aircraft is the perfect sized platform to allow Ryanair expand and grow its low fare services 
across Europe over the next decade. This new Boeing order helps Ryanair to lower its cost base and return to 
growth across Europe in 2021, by delivering lower fares to customers, as well as a lower CO2 and noise footprint, 
making Ryanair Europe's greenest, cleanest airline, and helping Ryanair reach its target of being carbon neutral by 
2050.
Boeing's President & CEO Dave Calhoun said: "Ryanair will continue to play a leading role in our industry when

up Thursday its first major order for the 737 MAX since the aircraft was grounded for 20 months following two fatal 
crashes as Irish no-frills airline Ryanair signed a deal to acquire 75 of the planes.The order was a sign of 
confidence in the aircraft which is moving towards a return to service following approval by the US Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) last month."Ryanair ... today signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-8200 
aircraft," the carrier said in a statement announcing the carrier was converting options for jets worth $7.0 billion (5.8 
billion euros) at list prices.The announcement brings the Dublin-based company's total order to 210 737 MAX 
aircraft with a total value of over $22 billion, it added."This has been a real partnership between Ryanair and 
Boeing," said Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in a press conference unveiling the deal.He meanwhile 
expressed confidence that Covid-19 vaccines would aid the aviation sector's recovery next year, following the 
global health emergency that had decimated international demand for air travel."We have got to look forward with 
great confidence. The vaccines are coming in the first quarter of next year," he said, adding that Ryanair had 
received a "very small" discount on the jets.

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing picked 
up Thursday its first major order for the 737 MAX since the aircraft was grounded for 20 months following two fatal 
crashes, as Irish no-frills airline Ryanair signed a deal to acquire 75 of the planes.The order -- which lifted Boeing 
shares for a second straight session -- was a sign of confidence in the aircraft which is moving towards a return to 
service following approval by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last month after upgrades to the plane 
and pilot training protocols."Ryanair... today signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-8200 
aircraft," the Irish airline said in a statement announcing it was converting options for jets worth $7.0 billion (5.8 
billion euros) at list prices.Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun vowed that the US aerospace giant had "recommitted" to 
safety to ensure that such devastating accidents never happen again."We will never forget the accidents that put us 
in the place that we were. Ever," Calhoun told journalists at a news conference unveiling the news.Thursday's 
announcement brings the Dublin-based company's total order to 210 737 MAX aircraft with a total value of over $22 
billion.The aircraft will meanwhile be delivered over a four-year period between spring 2021 and December 2024. 
"This has been a real partnership between Ryanair and Boeing," added Ryanair Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary.O'Leary in 2019 had employed expletives to describe Boeing's handling of the MAX crisis under prior 
leadership. 
On Thursday however, he credited Calhoun and other senior Boeing leaders for resetting the relationship between 
Boeing, the FAA and other senior regulators.In addition, he expressed confidence that Covid-19 vaccines would aid 
the aviation sector's recovery next year, following the global health emergency that had decimated international 
demand for air travel in 2020."We have got to look forward with great confidence. The vaccines are coming in the 
first quarter of next year," O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair had received a "very small" discount on the 
jets.Calhoun has said previously that he expected it would require about three years for the airline industry to 
recover to pre-pandemic levels of activity and about five years to return to growth. The announcement brings 
Ryanair's total order to 210 737 MAX aircraft with a total value of over $22 billion Photo: AFP / PASCAL PAVANI 
But on Thursday, the Boeing chief said the vaccine "came along a little faster than I think most people thought, 
which means that our timeline is a little more aggressive today" compared with earlier projections.The 
announcement follows a big step towards resuming commercial service on Wednesday when American Airlines 
completed a Boeing 737 MAX test flight.Ryanair's order follows a near two-year grounding of the jet after two fatal 
crashes that together killed a total of 346 people.The MAX aircraft had been a cash cow for Boeing prior to the fatal 
Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes in 2018 and 2019 respectively.Those calamities plunged the US aerospace 
giant into a crisis worsened by the fallout from the deadly coronavirus pandemic.Investigations identified a principal

cause of the two crashes as a faulty flight handling system that was supposed to keep the plane from stalling as it 
ascended but instead forced the nose of the plane downward. The FAA required Boeing to upgrade this system to 
address the flaw."We have re-instilled, reinvigorated everything that has anything to do with safety in our company," 
added Calhoun on Thursday."Recommitting to this is part of our culture... to make sure that nothing like this ever 
happens again.""I think we come out of here leaner and smarter... but most importantly, safer."Customers have 
meanwhile cancelled hundreds of orders for the MAX this year, but Boeing could see a rebound in interest should 
the plane again win more regulatory approvals.There has been 565 cancellations of 737 MAX jets from March 2019 
through to October this year.Boeing also still faces a number of government probes over its handling of the crisis 
and lawsuits from family members of victims who have lambasted the FAA for allowing the jet to fly again without 
further changes.Shares of Boeing jumped 7.1 percent to $239.66 in late morning trade in New York.

Late-Day Pullback Leads To Mixed Close On Wall Street
Late-Day Pullback Leads To Mixed Close On Wall Street

       After seeing strength for much of the session, stocks came under pressure going into the close of trading on 
Thursday. The major averages pulled back well off their highs, with the S&P; 500 sliding into negative territory. 
 The S&P; 500 edged down 2.29 points 0.1 percent to 3,666.72 after reaching a record intraday high, while the Dow 
rose 85.73 points or 0.3 percent to 29,969.52 and the Nasdaq edged up 27.82 points or 0.2 percent to a new record 
closing high of 12,377.18.
 The late-day pullback on Wall Street came after a report from the Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) expects to 
ship half of the coronavirus vaccines it originally planned for this year because of supply-chain problems.
 A company spokeswoman told the Journal that scaling up the raw material supply chain took longer than expected 
and noted the outcome of the clinical trial of the vaccine candidate was somewhat later than initially projected.
 The strength seen earlier in the day partly reflected a positive reaction to a report from the Labor Department 
showing a much bigger than expected decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week 
ended November 28th.
 The Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 712,000, a decrease of 75,000 from the previous 
week's revised level of 787,000.
 Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 775,000 from the 778,000 originally reported for the 
previous month.
 The weekly jobless claims data generated some positive sentiment ahead of the release of the Labor Department's 
more closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.
Late-Day Pullback Leads To Mixed Close On Wall Street
 Economists expect employment to increase by 481,000 jobs in November after jumping by 638,000 jobs in 
October. The unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent.
 Traders also kept an eye on developments in Washington, as lawmakers have resumed negotiations over a new 
fiscal stimulus bill. 
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ken., said a "compromise is within reach" but continues to favor his 
narrower approach to stimulus.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., deputy chief staff Drew Hammill noted the two leaders spoke by phone 
this afternoon and have a "shared commitment to completing an omnibus and COVID relief as soon as possible."
 Both Democrats and Republicans have offered new stimulus proposals, although it remains to be seen if 
lawmakers will finally reach an agreement after months of stagnation.
 Boeing (BA) helped to lead the Dow higher, with the aerospace giant jumping by 6 percent on news Europe's 
largest airline Ryanair is placing a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes
 Meanwhile, traders shrugged off a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing the slight pullback in 
the pace of growth in U.S. service sector activity continued in the month of November.
 The ISM said its services PMI edged down to 55.9 in November after dipping to 56.6 in October, although a 
reading above 50 still indicates growth. Economists had expected the index to slip to 56.0.
 Sector News
 Despite the late-day pullback by the broader markets, airline stocks held on to substantial gains. The NYSE Arca 
Airline Index soared by 4.5 percent to its best closing level in over nine months.
 Significant strength also remained visible among housing stocks, as reflected by the 2.8 percent jump by the 
Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. The index rebounded after closing lower for four straight sessions.
 Oil stocks also turned in a strong performance on the day, resulting in a 1.1 percent advance by the NYSE Arca Oil 
Index. The strength in the sector came as the price of crude for January delivery rose $0.36 to $45.64 a barrel.
 Most of the other major sectors ended the day showing more modest moves, contributing to the lackluster close by 
the broader markets. 
 Other Markets
 In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Thursday. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 Index closed just above the unchanged line, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed by 
0.7 percent.
 Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in another mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 
100 Index rose by 0.4 percent, the French CAC 40 Index edged down by 0.2 percent and the German DAX Index 
slid by 0.5 percent.
 In the bond market, treasuries regained ground as traders looked ahead to the monthly jobs report. As a result, the 
yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.8 basis points to 0.920 percent.
 Looking Ahead
Late-Day Pullback Leads To Mixed Close On Wall Street
 Trading on Friday is likely to be driven by reaction to the monthly jobs report, which will overshadow separate 
reports on the U.S. trade deficit and factory orders.

       Boeing Co. (BA) said Thursday that Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) has placed a firm order for 75 
additional 737 MAX aircraft, increasing its order book to 210 jets. Ryanair again selected the 737 8-200, a higher-
capacity version of the 737-8.
 Boeing's 737 MAX, which has been grounded for long following two fatal crashes, conducted its first post-
grounding flight with media onboard, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
 The Federal Aviation Administration in mid November lifted its 20-month safety ban on the 737 Max aircraft, and on 
November 30, it issued first airworthiness certificate for one of the new Boeing 737 Max jets.
 Boeing's best-selling aircraft was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes killed all 346 people aboard 
Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
 Separately, Ryanair confirmed Thursday that it signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-8200 
aircraft. It has increased its firm order for the Boeing aircraft from 135 to 210, with a total value of more than $22 
billion.
 Ryanair expects to take the first deliveries of the aircraft from early 2021. The confirmed 210 aircraft will be 
delivered over a 4-year period between Spring 2021 and December 2024.
 Ryanair and Boeing have agreed revised delivery dates, and have also agreed compensation for the direct costs 
incurred by Ryanair over the past 18 months due to delivery delays.

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Wall 
Street's main stock indices pushed higher on Thursday after Ryanair confirmed a major order of Boeing 737 MAX 
jets. The deal for 75 of the planes by the Irish low-cost carrier was the first major order for the 737 MAX since the 
aircraft was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes. The news, along with a successful test flight by 
American Airlines, help send shares in Boeing higher as the aircraft moves closer to returning to the skies after 
winning approval by US regulators last month. 
Shares in Boeing surged 7.4 percent higher. In late morning trading, the Dow was 0.6 percent higher, with the 
S&#38;P 500 pushing further into record territory.Sentiment was also helped by movement towards a new stimulus 
package.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw her support behind a $908-billion compromise virus relief package proposed 
by a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday. The proposal is however half what Democrats had previously been 
pushing for. "The narrative about how the market is feeling optimistic about 2021 recovery prospects because of the 
arrival of Covid vaccines is growing a bit tired, yet market participants have been given a stimulant with the 
increased buzz on Capitol Hill about the need to get another stimulus package done soon," said market analyst 
Patrick J. O'Hare at Briefing.com. He added that the continued high number of new jobless claims along with more 
than 100,000 Covid-19 hospitalisations in the US were factors in the market viewing it as likely that a deal will be 
done relatively soon.The eurozone's equity markets slipped on survey data indicating the region's economy 
continued to be battered by coronavirus fallout. In eurozone trades Thursday, Frankfurt's DAX 30 index shed 0.5 
percent and the Paris CAC 40 dropped 0.2 percent. Data provider IHS Markit said its closely-watched composite 
eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 45.3 points in November from 50 in October, according to final 
estimates. Britain's services PMI dropped to 47.6 from 51.4. A level below 50 points indicates contraction. 
Nevertheless, London's FTSE 100 managed a 0.4 percent gain thanks to a good performance by international 
mining stocks. Nancy Pelosi has welcomed a bipartisan stimulus proposal that investors hope can break a months-
long deadlock with Republicans AFP / Nicholas Kamm Meanwhile the pound surged to its highest level in a year, 
briefly rising above $1.35, after a government official expressed confidence on reaching a post-Brexit trade deal 
with the EU. "It's the kind of comment that has been heard before in the last couple of weeks, without anything 
materialising," said market analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex. "Nevertheless, with the deadline looming, 
sterling will take what it can get." Oil prices drifted higher as a crucial OPEC gathering debated whether to extend 
the current level of output cuts.New York - Dow: UP 0.6 percent at 30,057.37  London - FTSE 100: UP 0.4 percent

       Stocks have moved moderately higher in morning trading on Thursday, continuing to rebound from the early 
weakness seen in the previous session. The advance has lifted the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 to new record 
intraday highs.
 Currently, the major averages are all in positive territory. The Dow is up 174.99 points or 0.6 percent at 30,058.78, 
the Nasdaq is up 61.31 points or 0.5 percent at 12,410.67 and the S&P; 500 is up 11.44 points or 0.3 percent at 
3,680.45.
 The strength on Wall Street partly reflects a positive reaction to a report from the Labor Department showing a 
much bigger than expected decrease in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended 
November 28th.
 The Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 712,000, a decrease of 75,000 from the previous 
week's revised level of 787,000.
 Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 775,000 from the 778,000 originally reported for the 
previous month.
 The weekly jobless claims data has generated some positive sentiment ahead of the release of the Labor 
Department's more closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.
 Economists expect employment to increase by 481,000 jobs in November after jumping by 638,000 jobs in 
October. The unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 6.8 percent from 6.9 percent.
 Meanwhile, a separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed the slight pullback in the rate of 
growth in U.S. service sector activity continued in the month of November.
U.S. Stocks Move Moderately Higher On Upbeat Jobless Claims Data
 The ISM said its services PMI edged down to 55.9 in November after dipping to 56.6 in October, although a 
reading above 50 still indicates growth. Economists had expected the index to slip to 56.0.
 Boeing (BA) has helped to lead the Dow higher, with the aerospace giant jumping by 5.3 percent on news Europe's 
largest airline Ryanair is placing a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes
 Airline stocks have moved sharply higher in morning trading, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index soaring by 5.3 
percent to its best intraday level in over nine months.
 Notable strength has also emerged among oil stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent gain being posted by the 
NYSE Arca Oil Index. The strength in the sector comes despite a modest drop by the price of crude oil.
 Housing, transportation, and semiconductor stocks are also seeing some strength on the day, while gold stocks 
have moved to the downside.
 In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Thursday. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 Index closed just above the unchanged line, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed by 
0.7 percent.
 Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in another mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s 
FTSE 100 Index has risen by 0.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.3 percent and the German DAX 
Index is down by 0.5 percent.
 In the bond market, treasuries are regaining ground after trending lower over the past few sessions. As a result, the 
yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.9 basis points at 0.929 
percent.

Highlight: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is set to exercise an option to order up to 75 additional Boeing 737 MAX 
aircraft.
Body
If it takes place, the deal will bring the European budget carrier's MAX order to as much as 210 aircraft, Reuters 
reported. The news follows the publication of the final approval of the modified 737 MAX in the Federal Register by 
the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) late last month. 
Since March last year, the aircraft has been temporarily grounded following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and 
Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people. Meanwhile, reports emerged saying that Boeing has completed the first 
post-grounding flight for 737 MAX on 2 December to validate the safety of the redesigned jet. American Airlines 737 
MAX flight flew for 45 minutes from Dallas, Texas, to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the US with media onboard. Captain Pete 
Gamble said: "The history of aviation is built around a chain of safety. "When the chain of safety breaks, it's up to 
those of us in the industry to mend it and bring it back." In addition, several other regulators have started their 
process to approve the aircraft for reoperations after revisions to cockpit software and pilot training. Last month, the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) started its preparation to return grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft 
to service. UAE civil aviation regulator General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) also revealed its plan to bring the 
grounded Boeing 737 MAX back to service.

Boeing Picks Up Big Order For 737 MAX Jets From Ryanair

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing 
picked up Thursday its first major order for the 737 MAX since the aircraft was grounded for 20 months following 
two fatal crashes as Irish no-frills airline Ryanair signed a deal to acquire 75 of the planes. The order was a sign of 
confidence in the aircraft which is moving towards a return to service following approval by the US Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) last month. 
"Ryanair ... today signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-8200 aircraft," the carrier said in a 
statement announcing the carrier was converting options for jets worth $7.0 billion (5.8 billion euros) at list prices. 
The announcement brings the Dublin-based company's total order to 210 737 MAX aircraft with a total value of over 
$22 billion, it added. "This has been a real partnership between Ryanair and Boeing," said Ryanair Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary in a press conference unveiling the deal. He meanwhile expressed confidence that Covid-19 
vaccines would aid the aviation sector's recovery next year, following the global health emergency that had 
decimated international demand for air travel.  "We have got to look forward with great confidence. The vaccines 
are coming in the first quarter of next year," he said, adding that Ryanair had received a "very small" discount on 
the jets. The announcement brings Ryanair's total order to 210 737 MAX aircraft with a total value of over $22 
billion AFP / PASCAL PAVANI The announcement follows a big step towards resuming commercial service on 
Wednesday when American Airlines completed a Boeing 737 MAX test flight. The US Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) last month cleared the MAX to return to service following upgrades to the plane and pilot 
training protocols. "Now that the Boeing MAX aircraft has been certified by the FAA to return to service, Ryanair 
expects to take the first deliveries of these new fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft from early 2021," 
Ryanair said Wednesday. The 210 firm aircraft orders would meanwhile be delivered over a four-year period 
between spring 2021 and December 2024. Ryanair's order follows a near two-year grounding of the jet after two 
fatal crashes that together killed a total of 346 people. The MAX aircraft had been a cash cow for Boeing prior to the 
fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Those calamities plunged the US 
aerospace giant into a crisis worsened by the fallout from the deadly coronavirus pandemic, which also had a 
devastating impact on commercial air travel.

Dec 03, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing 
picked up Thursday its first major order for the 737 MAX since the aircraft was grounded for 20 months following 
two fatal crashes, as Irish no-frills airline Ryanair signed a deal to acquire 75 of the planes. The order -- which lifted 
Boeing shares for a second straight session -- was a sign of confidence in the aircraft which is moving towards a 
return to service following approval by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last month after upgrades to 
the plane and pilot training protocols. "Ryanair... today signed a purchase agreement with Boeing for 75 new MAX-
8200 aircraft," the Irish airline said in a statement announcing it was converting options for jets worth $7.0 billion 
(5.8 billion euros) at list prices. 
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun vowed that the US aerospace giant had "recommitted" to safety to ensure that such 
devastating accidents never happen again. "We will never forget the accidents that put us in the place that we were. 
Ever," Calhoun told journalists at a news conference unveiling the news. Thursday's announcement brings the 
Dublin-based company's total order to 210 737 MAX aircraft with a total value of over $22 billion. The aircraft will 
meanwhile be delivered over a four-year period between spring 2021 and December 2024."This has been a real 
partnership between Ryanair and Boeing," added Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. O'Leary in 2019 had 
employed expletives to describe Boeing's handling of the MAX crisis under prior leadership. On Thursday however, 
he credited Calhoun and other senior Boeing leaders for resetting the relationship between Boeing, the FAA and 
other senior regulators. In addition, he expressed confidence that Covid-19 vaccines would aid the aviation sector's 
recovery next year, following the global health emergency that had decimated international demand for air travel in 
2020.  "We have got to look forward with great confidence. The vaccines are coming in the first quarter of next 
year," O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair had received a "very small" discount on the jets. Calhoun has said 
previously that he expected it would require about three years for the airline industry to recover to pre-pandemic 
levels of activity and about five years to return to growth. The announcement brings Ryanair's total order to 210 737 
MAX aircraft with a total value of over $22 billion AFP / PASCAL PAVANI But on Thursday, the Boeing chief said 
the vaccine "came along a little faster than I think most people thought, which means that our timeline is a little 
more aggressive today" compared with earlier projections. The announcement follows a big step towards resuming 
commercial service on Wednesday when American Airlines completed a Boeing 737 MAX test flight. Ryanair's

the plane downward. The FAA required Boeing to upgrade this system to address the flaw."We have re-instilled, 
reinvigorated everything that has anything to do with safety in our company," added Calhoun on Thursday. 
"Recommitting to this is part of our culture... to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again." "I think we 
come out of here leaner and smarter... but most importantly, safer." Customers have meanwhile cancelled 
hundreds of orders for the MAX this year, but Boeing could see a rebound in interest should the plane again win 
more regulatory approvals. There has been 565 cancellations of 737 MAX jets from March 2019 through to October 
this year. Boeing also still faces a number of government probes over its handling of the crisis and lawsuits from 
family members of victims who have lambasted the FAA for allowing the jet to fly again without further changes. 
Shares of Boeing jumped 7.1 percent to $239.66 in late morning trade in New York.

 Boeing (BA) said on Thursday Ryanair (RYAAY) is placing a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes, 
increasing its order book to 210 jets. 
Ryanair again selected the 737 8-200, a higher-capacity version of the 737-8, with 197 seats and a 16% lower fuel 
consumption compared to the airline's previous airplanes, the aircraft maker said.
The 737 Max was cleared to fly again by the Federal Aviation Administration last month after it was grounded in 
March 2019 following two fatal crashes.
"Boeing remains focused on safely returning the full 737 fleet to service and on delivering the backlog of airplanes 
to Ryanair and our other customers," CEO Dave Calhoun.
Boeing shares rose over 5% in morning trading, and Ryanair was up more than 2%.

Dec 03, 2020( 24/7 Wall St.: http://www.247wallst.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Aerospace &#38; Defense  As 
expected, Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: RYAAY[1]) on Thursday signed a firm order for 75 new 
Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA[2]) 737 Max 8-200 passenger jets in a deal worth about $9.4 billion at the list price of $124.8 
million per plane. The deal lifts Ryanair's firm orders for Boeing's top-seller to 210 aircraft valued at more than $26 
billion.Interestingly, Boeing used the 737 Max designation only one time in the announcement of the deal. 
The aircraft were referred to more often as the 737 8-200 or the 737-8. The plane also has been referred to as the 
737-8200. Boeing CEO David Calhoun said that the Max name isn't going anywhere and that 'there is nothing cute 
going on' with the plane's name.First delivery of new planes to the airline is expected to begin in the spring and run 
through 2024. Each plane will include two LEAP-1B engines from CFM, a 50/50 joint venture between Safran and 
General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE[3]).The 737 Max 8-200 is configured to seat 197 passengers, near the high end of 
a maximum capacity of 210 and more than the standard two-class configuration of between 162 and 178 
seats.According to Planespotters, the airline's fleet of 737-800s (the previous generation) totals 433, of which 362 
are currently in service. The fleet has an average age per plane of 8.8 years, young by aircraft standards and nearly 
five years younger than the 23 Airbus A320-200s in Ryanair's fleet.Aircraft makers typically sell their new planes to 
large buyers at discounts of 40% to 50% below list price. Ryanair likely is receiving an even larger discount as 
compensation for delivery delays due to the grounding of the 737 Max following two crashes that killed 346 people. 
As we noted on Wednesday, however, whatever Ryanair is paying is an improvement over zero, which is how much 
money Boeing has made on the 737 Max since its grounding in March 2019.Leeham News and Analysis notes that 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the deal was struck at a 'modest discount'[4] to the list price, and Boeing's 
Calhoun said the company doesn't 'feel a need to discount our way into the marketplace.'Calling the 737 Max the 
'most scrutinized, most audited planes in history,' O'Leary also said he 'cannot tell you how confident' Ryanair is in 
the safety of the aircraft.Ryanair and Boeing are also discussing an order for the larger 737 Max 10, O'Leary noted. 
He also believes that when President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month, the trade war between the European 
Union and the United States will be resolved and tariffs now imposed on exports of Boeing and Airbus planes 
across the Atlantic will be lifted.Boeing stock traded up about 8% in the noon hour Thursday, at $241.57 in a 52-
week range of $89.00 to $354.40. The stock's consensus price target is $200.55.GE's shares traded up about 
2.5%, at $10.69 in a 52-week range of $5.48 to $13.26, and Ryanair stock traded up about 3.4% to $110.21, in a 
52-week range of $44.44 to $111.53, a new high posted earlier Thursday morning. Get Our Free Investment

Dec 03, 2020( Axios: https://link.axios.com/join/am-signup?source=aci Delivered by Newstex)  Dublin-based 
Ryanair said it would add 75 more planes to an existing order for Boeing's 737 Max airplanes, a giant vote of 
confidence as Boeing seeks to revive sales of its best-selling plane after a 20-month safety ban following two fatal 
crashes. The big picture: Ryanair's big order, on the heels of breakthrough vaccine news, is also a promising sign 
that the devastated airline industry might recover from the global pandemic sooner than expected. 
"This vaccine came a long a little faster than most folks thought, which means our timeline for recovery is a little 
more aggressive today" than the three to five years that officials feared back in the spring, Boeing CEO David 
Calhoun told reporters Thursday. "I am confident that this is a signal of a more robust order book," adding that 
airlines in the strongest financial position, like Ryanair, would lead that faster recovery. Details: With the new 
purchase, RyanAir is bringing its total order for 737 Max planes to 205, worth $22 billion. Michael O'Leary, CEO of 
the low-cost Irish carrier, has called Boeing jet a "gamechanger" because its design allows the airline to carry more 
passengers and burn less fuel. Ryanair received a "modest discount" on the new planes, he said, adding that the 
favorable economics would boost the airline's growth and profitability over the next five years."Vaccines are coming 
in the first quarter of next year," an upbeat O'Leary said. "There is going to be a very strong recovery. I have been 
waiting for this aircraft for 5 years." Driving the news: United Airlines also announced this week they would use the 
737 Max planes in two of its largest hubs starting in 2021. Likewise, American Airlines will start commercial flights[1] 
on the plane between LaGuardia and Miami in late December. The bottom line: After what Calhoun called "one 
tough year," Ryanair delivered a spark of hope. [ 1]: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/american-airlines-starts-

       Boeing Co's 737 MAX, which has been grounded for long following two fatal crashes, conducted its first post-
grounding flight with media onboard, Reuters reported.
 American Airlines' 737 MAX flight with around 90 journalists took a 45-minute journey from Dallas, Texas, to Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. The redesigned jet is scheduled to start its first commercial passenger flight on December 29.
 Boeing's best-selling aircraft was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes killed all 346 people aboard 
Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
 The Federal Aviation Administration in mid November lifted its 20-month safety ban on the 737 Max aircraft, and on 
November 30, it issued first airworthiness certificate for one of the new Boeing 737 Max jets.
 Reuters reported, citing industry sources, that European budget airline Ryanair was set to place a hefty order for 
up to 75 additional 737 MAX jets.

Dec 03, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair just upped its 
Boeing 737 Max order by 75 aircraft for a total of 210 in a $22 billion order. The Boeing 737 Max 8200, as Ryanair 
calls it, will seat 197 passengers in a high-density configuration ideal for low-cost operations. Deliveries will begin in 
spring 2021 with Ryanair expecting all of the aircraft by 2025. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more 
stories[1].Ireland's Ryanair is the latest carrier to seek out more Boeing 737 Max jets now that the Federal Aviation 
Administration has ended the 20-month grounding and a return to passenger service is in sight.The infamous 
carrier just purchased[2] 75 Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft to join its fleet, growing Ryanair's total order to 210 
aircraft to be delivered by 2025. The 8200 variant is Boeing's high-density model of the Max, aimed at ultra-low-cost 
carriers like Ryanair to further maximize the jet's cost-saving economics by filling it with as many passengers as 
possible.Ryanair is known for its tight planes and the Max 8200 will be no different as 197 seats will be jammed into 
the plane that normally seats less than 180. though CEO Michael O'Leary says it will have "more legroom."It's 
essentially the same design as the Max 8 but requires an extra emergency exit door to accommodate the additional 
passengers.As an all-Boeing 737 airline, Ryanair was an early supporter of the 737 Max, placing an order for 100 
aircraft in December 2014[3] and upped its commitment over the years[4]. The March 2019 grounding, however, 
prevented Ryanair from taking delivery of the jets just months before planned with some sitting built and painted at 
Boeing's Washington facilities but undelivered.The Max 8200 aircraft has a current list price of $124.8 million[5] with 
the total order valued at over $22 billion. 
Ryanair confirmed, however, that Boeing knocked the price down due to the grounding and will provide further 
compensation for the inconvenience.Airlines are rushing to get their Max planes back in the air and receive their 
undelivered models to take advantage of the jet's cost savings, especially during the pandemic when every dollar 
counts. Ryanair is already famous for its extremely low fares while still turning a profit and an aircraft like the Max 
can further pad its margins.Read more:United's CEO argued it's not a problem that airlines will keep burning tens of 
millions of cash per day for months[6]"We hope to take delivery of at least 50 of these aircraft in 2021, subject to 
Boeing recovering its manufacturing output to deliver them," O'Leary said in a statement. Economics over public 
opinion While the two fatal crashes have turned public sentiment against the aircraft, airlines are clearly seeing 
dollar signs as the economic benefits of the jet are outweighing customer misgivings after the deaths of 346

passengers.Alaska Airlines officially announced an order for 13 737 Max 9 aircraft in November[7] and Southwest 
Airlines is reportedly in talks to purchase up to 30 "white-tail"[8] jets that were built but never delivered to a 
customer. Delta Air Lines doesn't currently operate the aircraft but has reportedly considering adding the aircraft to 
its fleet, CEO Ed Bastian told the Financial Times[9]. All US airlines flying the jet have vowed to let uncomfortable 
passengers change their flight to avoid flying on it. American Airlines will open the jet up for customer tours and will 
operate flights to nowhere for employees so workers too can feel comfortable on the plane.Business Insider's David 
Slotnick was among the first passengers on the aircraft's first flight with members of the public on Wednesday[10]. 
American brought members of the media to its maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma for an inside look at how the 
fleet will be returned to service in advance of its relaunch on December 29.Ryanair will begin taking delivery of its

Dec 03, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  WASHINGTON (AP)   Irish budget 
airline Ryanair is ordering more Boeing 737 Max jets just weeks before the plane returns to flying after two crashes 
that killed 346 people. Ryanair said Thursday it was placing 75 more orders for the Max, increasing its orders to 210 
of the planes.  The announcement was a boost for Boeing, which has suffered cancellations of the plane while it 
was grounded for nearly two years and while demand for new jets plummeted because of the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the planes offer lower fuel consumption and quieter flying than other aircraft. He 
expressed confidence that customers will fly on the plane, and that demand for travel will recover next year as virus 
vaccines become widely available. Between cancellations and orders threatened by airlines' pandemic losses, 
Boeing's backlog of Max jets has shrunk by more than 1,000 this year. Boeing CEO David Calhoun said he was 
confident that the Ryanair move was the beginning of the company's bid to rebuild its Max order book. Financial 
terms of the deal were not disclosed. In normal times, airlines receive deep discounts off list prices, and Boeing 
may be under more pressure to cut prices because of recent cancellations. Max jets were grounded worldwide in 
March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last month the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared 
the way for the plane's return by prescribing new flight-control software and other changes. Companies Mentioned

Dec 03, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In this Sept. 12, 2018 file photo, a 
Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Boeing's troubled 737 Max jet is getting a vote of confidence 
from Ireland's Ryanair, one of Europe's biggest budget airlines. 
Ryanair announced Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020, that it will order 75 more Max jets, bringing its total orders to 210. The 
move comes just weeks before the plane is expected to resume flying. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)Irish budget 
airline Ryanair said Thursday it is ordering 75 more Boeing 737 Max jets, a boost for Boeing just before its most 
important plane returns to flying after two deadly crashes. The order would be worth more than $9 billion at list 
prices, although airlines routinely receive deep discounts. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Boeing 
shares rose 6% to $237.20, their highest closing price in nearly nine months. The announcement was a huge lift for 
Chicago-based Boeing, which has suffered canceled orders for the plane since it was grounded nearly 21 months 
ago and while demand for new jets plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic. So far this year, customers 
have canceled orders for 448 Max jets and Boeing has raised doubt about another 782 orders because of the 
airlines' pandemic-weakened financial health. Before Ryanair's order, the company had reported only five Max 
orders in 2020. Boeing CEO David Calhoun said he is confident that the Ryanair move is the beginning of the 
company's bid to rebuild its Max order book. Airlines usually get deep discounts off list prices for planes. Calhoun 
dismissed the idea that Boeing may be under more pressure to cut prices because of a pandemic that is causing 
massive losses at its airline customers and the Max's own troubled past. The company is trying to resell planes 
covered by previous deals that were later canceled. 'We don't feel a need to discount our way into the marketplace,' 
he said. The new deal would push Ryanair's total orders for the Max to 210 planes. CEO Michael O'Leary said that 
with the additional 75 planes, Max jets will make up one-third of Ryanair's fleet in five years, up from 6% now. 
O'Leary said the planes offer lower fuel consumption and quieter flying than other aircraft. He expressed confidence 
that travel will recover next year as virus vaccines become widely available and that customers will get back on the 
Max. (Ad) Jeff Brown is a member of the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce... And has been asked to share his 
expertise with officials at the highest level of our national defense and intelligence communities. Today, he's issuing 
a special warning to Mr. Trump.  'The one issue that's going to come up here today is safety, so let's get it out front,' 
O'Leary said on a call with reporters. 'This is the most scrutinized, most audited aircraft in history. It's also going to 
be one of the safest.' Max jets were grounded worldwide in March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia just 
five months apart killed a total of 346 people. Last month the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and regulators in 
Europe cleared the way for the plane's return by prescribing new flight-control software and other changes. Brazil's 
Gol airline plans to operate flights with paying passengers starting next week. American Airlines plans the first U.S.

flight for Dec. 29 from Miami to New York. With its previously best-selling plane grounded, Boeing has lost $3.5 
billion so far this year and announced deep jobs cuts to reduce costs. Boeing expects the pandemic to cast a pall 
over demand for airline jets for several years. Companies Mentioned in This Article Compare These Stocks[1] Add 
These Stocks to My Watchlist[2]7 Housing Sector Stocks That May Be Ready to Explode[3]In one of the strongest 
economies our nation has ever known, housing stocks should have been going through the roof. But it took the 
Federal Reserve practically giving money away for homebuyers to get their appetite back. And then even with 
mortgage rates at historical lows, the novel coronavirus came on the scene and ruined the party again. Home 
buying and home building came to a halt. Some of which was simply due to the fact that Americans were staying 
inside. One of the closely watched indicators of the health of the housing market is the National Association of 
Home Builders (NAHB) Housing Market Index (HMI). In March, prior to the national mitigation efforts, the HMI had 
climbed to 72. For reference purposes, a neutral reading is 50. Although not unexpected, April showed just how far 
demand had fallen. The HMI plunged 42 points to 30. Things got slightly better in May as the index climbed to 37. 
But that may be changing. In June, the HMI posted a better than expected 56.8%. After hitting 37 in May, this 
marked the Index's largest monthly gain ever. And not surprisingly some lagging housing stocks got a much-
needed jump start. Homebuilder stocks in particular have been on the rise in recent months. To help you capitalize 
on what looks like an emerging trend for the rest of the year, we've put together this special presentation. View the

Dec 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, pilots 
at Delta Air Lines DAL[1] voted in favor of accepting reduced pays in a bid to save their jobs until 2022. Per the Air 
Line Pilots' Association, the union that represents Delta's pilots, the salary-cut plan won 74% pilots' support.JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[2] also grabbed headlines because of its bearish projections for the December quarter due to the 
current booking trends. The carrier believes that the recovery in demand and its revenue rebound will be 'non-linear 
through the fourth quarter and beyond'. Notably, United Airlines UAL[3] too issued a bleak outlook for the final 
quarter of 2020 as was reported in the previous week's write up[4]. Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Per 
aCNBC report[5],Delta's pilots agreed to accept pay cuts to avoid furloughs until 2022. The carrier is making 
consistent efforts to reduce costs as it grapples with coronavirus-induced weak air-travel demand. Per the deal, the 
carrier can trim pilots' guaranteed hours by as much 5%. Additionally, more than 1,700 pilots will get a partial pay of 
30 hours a month even without having to fly. These pilots would have otherwise been furloughed at the end of the 
month without a deal.2. In a SEC filing, JetBlue management stated that it estimates capacity for the fourth quarter 
to decline 45-50% year over year from its previous expectation of a decrease of approximately 45%. The company 
plans to keep managing capacity on a rolling basis so that it is in line with demand. 
Amid volatile booking trends, the carrier predicts revenues to plunge approximately 70% year over year from its 
earlier expectation of a slump of nearly 65%[6].3. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] November traffic tanked 82% year 
over year to 2 million guests as coronavirus keeps air-travel demand suppressed. On a rolling-annual basis, total 
traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) plummeted 60% to 61.4 million.Additionally, per a Reuters 
report[8], the Irish carrier, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is set to place an order of up to 75 additional 
Boeing 737 MAX jets. Notably, the jets were recently certified to be safe for flying again by the U.S. Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) after being grounded since March 2019.You can seethe complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[9]4. Alaska Air Group's ALK[10] subsidiary Alaska Airlines announced 
plans to lease 13 new Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft fromAir Lease CorporationAL[11] as part of its fleet modernization 
efforts. Alaska Airlines will receive deliveries of the 13 737-9 MAX aircraft from fourth-quarter 2021 through 
2022.[12]5 The U.S. Department of Transportation tightened the rule pertaining to passengers travelling with 
service animals on flights[13]. The ruling states that only dogs will qualify as service animals. In a major change, 
animals brought by passengers for emotional support will no longer fall under service animals. This strict ruling may

Global industry bodies call for the extension of slot relief

The leading global associations of airlines, airport operators, and slot coordinators have called upon the legislators 
to extend slot relief for the Summer 2021 season. However, they do not postulate the prolonged abolishment of 
these rules. In a joint press release, Airports Council International (ACI World), the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA), and the Worldwide Airport Coordinators Group (WWACG) proposed to lower the threshold of 
slot usage from the standard 80% to 50%. As such, airlines which use half of their allocated slots would be able to 
retain them. 
In regular times, airlines which fail to operate more than 20% of their planned flights lose slots. The industry bodies 
also appealed for a more specific definition of force majeure, which permits the cancellation of flights with no 
consequences regarding slot allocation. In particular, they suggested adding quarantine measures or border 
closures to the definition. Finally, the organisations also want to allow airlines to return slots on a temporary basis 
voluntarily. Those which do so by the end of February 2020 would be allowed to regain the same slots for the 
Summer 2022 season. "The existing slot rules were never designed to cope with a prolonged industry collapse. 
Regulators temporarily suspended the rules for Summer and Winter 2020 to give the industry vital breathing space. 
International air traffic, though, is only expected to return to about 25% of 2019 levels by summer 2021. To preserve 
connectivity while air traffic recovers, a more flexible system of slot regulation is essential," the organisations said. 
The Worldwide Airport Slot Board (WASB), which comprises the three organisations, plays a crucial role in 
allocating slots and mediating compromises between the airlines and airports. However, it has no power to set the 
underlying legal rules, which are the prerogative of respective legislatures around the world. The European Union, 
which has the world's most formalised slot allocation system, has suspended all normal rules, including the 80/20 
usage requirement, for the entire Summer 2020 and Winter 2020/21 seasons. The US Federal Aviation 
Administration, which regulates slots at only seven gateways, has similarly waived the use-it-or-lose-it rule for the 
time being. Wizz Air and Ryanair have been vocally opposing the extension of slot relief. Both airlines argue that by 
restoring normal rules, the regulators would facilitate the takeover of slots by airlines willing to expand even in the 
current market - i.e., by the low-cost carriers.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) is close to placing an order for dozens of additional 737 Max jets from Boeing (BA), Reuters 
reported on Wednesday.
The Irish budget airline has an option to expand its current order by 75 planes to 210 aircraft. Ryanair declined to 
comment on the report while Boeing could not immediately be reached for comment, Reuters said.
The transaction comes after regulators in the US and European Union recently approved the Max's return to service 
following a lengthy safety grounding.

Dec 02, 2020( 24/7 Wall St.: http://www.247wallst.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Aerospace &#38; Defense  Just two 
weeks ago, the Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA[1]) 737 Max jet was recertified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), and less than a week later the European Union's civil aviation regulator followed suit. On Monday, the FAA 
certified the first 737 Max for delivery to a customer since March of 2019, when the aircraft was grounded following 
two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. 
 Boeing has about 450 737 Max aircraft built since the grounding parked at various locations around the country, 
and it expects to deliver half of those next year and the remaining planes in 2022. At the same time, the company 
will gradually ramp up production of the 737 Max to a projected total of 31 per month by the end of 2022. It's worth 
noting that under the FAA's recertification of the 737 Max, the agency must certify every single plane for delivery. 
Prior to the grounding, the FAA had off-loaded that work to Boeing. To help the company finance and sell all those 
planes, Boeing on Tuesday announced a partnership with private equity firm Castlelake. Under the agreement, 
Castlelake will provide up to $5 billion in capital for new Boeing aircraft deliveries by means of senior secured 
financing, mezzanine financing and high loan-to-value finance leases.Castlelake has acquired more than 650 
airplanes and 1,000 aircraft engines since the firm's inception in 2005. The firm focuses its investments in new 
aircraft, younger midlife aircraft and vintage planes. The agreement with Boeing marks Castlelake's expansion into 
aviation lending and is likely to help keep Boeing's own financing arm, Boeing Capital, from assuming too much 
risk. The final feather in Boeing's cap (so far this week) comes in a report from Reuters that low-cost carrier Ryanair 
is close to placing an order for as many as 75 new 737 Max jets. The company already has 135 of the planes listed 
on Boeing's order book as undelivered as of October 31, and the possible addition of 75 planes would bring 
Ryanair's total number of undelivered 737 Max jets to 210. While Ryanair and Boeing have been negotiating 
compensation to the airline for delays caused by the 737 Max grounding, and now that both U.S. and European 
regulators have recertified the planes, those negotiations finally have some reason to get serious. A 737 Max costs 
about $125 million at list price (an average of the Max 8 and the larger Max 9). Aircraft makers typically sell their 
new planes to big buyers at discounts of 40% to 50% of list price. Ryanair is likely holding out for an even larger 
discount. Whatever the price, it's an improvement over zero, which is how much money Boeing has made on the 
737 Max in more than 20 months. In the noon hour Wednesday, Boeing shares traded up about 2.5% to $218.36, in 
a 52-week range of $89.00 to $355.29. The stock's consensus 12-month price target is $200.55. ALSO READ:

Ryanair has placed an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
The carrier has selected the higher-capacity 200 version of the 737-8, citing the aircraft's additional seats and 
improved fuel efficiency and environmental performance.
This brings the Dublin-based carrier's firm orderbook up to 210 for the variant. The aircraft will be delivered over a 
four year period between spring 2021 and December 2024. 
Ryanair is the launch customer for the high-capacity 737-8 variant, having placed its first order for 100 airplanes 
and 100 options in late 2014, followed by firm orders of 10 airplanes in 2017 and 25 in 2018.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows that the Irish carrier has yet to take delivery of the type.
The announcement follows the Federal Aviation Administration's lifting of its ban on the Max.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is expected to issue a final airworthiness directive formally 
clearing the way for the Boeing 737 Max to return to European skies in January 2021.
"Ryanair will continue to play a leading role in our industry when Europe recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic and 
air traffic returns to growth across the continent. We are gratified that Ryanair is once again placing its confidence in 
the Boeing 737 family and building their future fleet with this enlarged firm order," said Dave Calhoun, president and 
chief executive of Boeing.

Ryanair's adjusted debt will have roughly tripled during its current financial year, according to analysis from S&P 
Global Ratings.
The agency expects the low-cost carrier's debt to reach up to (EURO)1.2 billion ($1.45 billion) by 31 March 2021, 
from about (EURO)434 million a year earlier.
S&P also forecasts an adjusted EBITDA loss of (EURO)150 million to (EURO)160 million for Ryanair this fiscal 
year, versus a (EURO)1.48 billion EBITDA profit in 2019/20.
However, if vaccine rollouts prove successful by the middle of next year, S&P expects Ryanair to be cash flow 
positive in 2021/22. As a result, it has affirmed the airline's BBB rating, albeit with a negative outlook.
"We assume a significant rebound in air traffic in the second half of calendar year 2021, underpinned by our current 
view that the several effective vaccines against COVID-19 will become widely available by the middle of 2021 and 
help to lessen or lift travel restrictions and restore passenger confidence in flying," stated S&P analysts.
They added: "To revise the outlook to stable, we would need to be confident that demand conditions are 
normalizing and the recovery is robust enough to enable Ryanair to partly restore its financial strength."
S&P also noted that Ryanair has taken significant measures to lower capital expenditure, including spending only 
(EURO)300 million on maintenance this fiscal year versus a pre-pandemic prediction of (EURO)2 billion.

ALC trims 737 Max orders again

Boeing has disclosed cancellations of another 88 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the month to 30 November, including 
an additional 13 cancelled Max orders from Air Lease (ALC).
This brings ALC's outright cancellations of the type to 32 aircraft this year.
California-based ALC cut its 737 Max orderbook by another 14 aircraft in the third quarter "in line with our 
contractual rights to do so", lessor chief executive John Plueger said. In March, ALC converted orders for nine 737 
Max units to three 787 aircraft; in the second quarter the lessor cancelled five Max aircraft.
The U.S. lessor's 737 Max backlog now stands at 113 Max units, Boeing data shows.
ALC said it canceled orders on "a case-by-case basis" following discussions with its airline customers.
ALC also had options for another 45 737 Max 8s with Boeing, but these have expired without being exercised.
Last month, Alaska Airlines agreed to sell and lease back 10 Airbus A320s with ALC as part of a transaction that 
will also see ALC place 13 737 Max 9s at the airline. Alaska said that the Max 9s will be delivered from the fourth 
quarter of 2021 and come from the lessor's orderbook.
Other customers who cancelled 737 Max orders in November included Air Canada and Virgin Australia.
Earlier this month, and thus not reflected in the aforementioned figures, Ryanair placed an order for 75 additional 
737 Max aircraft.
Boeing had 4,240 aircraft left in its backlog to 30 November after taking more than 1,100 off its books in 2020 - 
almost 500 outright cancellations and more than 600 aircraft removed following ASC606 adjustments.
The U.S. OEM's remaining backlog includes 3,333 737 programme aircraft, nine 747s, 81 767s, 346 777s and 471 
787s.
In the 11 months to 30 November, Boeing delivered 118 aircraft and received new orders for 94 commercial units.

HSBC downgrades Wizz on overstretched share price
HSBC downgrades Wizz on overstretched share price

HSBC has downgraded Wizz Air from buy to hold after concluding that its current market valuation is "more 
stretched" than a number of its European peers.
Having analysed the share price of Wizz, Easyjet, IAG and Ryanair using an equity value (EV) analysis, a reverse 
discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation and price to net asset value, the bank concluded that Wizz's valuation 
appears "most demanding".
It stated that the airline's stock is trading within 5% of its target price, making a downgrade necessary.  HSBC's 
analysts noted that airline share prices have responded very positively to recent favourable news about vaccines.
Share prices for stocks in its European coverage are up 58% in the past month.
Wizz Air is trading at an "extremely high premium" to net asset value, which reflects the business's asset light 
structure, operating almost entirely leased aircraft and operating mainly from secondary airports without slot value.
The medium-term EBIT margin implied by its current share price is higher than its five-year average EBIT, which is 
unique to the group, HSBC stated.
Its EV now is 26% ahead of it pre-pandemic level, up the most of all carriers. These metrics imply sustained future 
value creation and that the company has stronger prospects than before the pandemic.
"We think these are both fair assumptions, although the scale of future outperformance relative to history becomes 
a matter for debate in our view," the bank said.
Ryanair's valuation appears to be the "second most demanding" the HSBC note stated, though it appears 
attractively valued on a reverse DCF basis.
It trades at a 137% premium to its NAV. The medium-term EBIT margin implied by its current share price is 5.2pts 
lower than its five-year average EBIT. Its EV now is 14% ahead of its pre-pandemic level, up the second most of all 
carriers.
"These metrics imply sustained future value creation and that the company has stronger prospects than before the 
pandemic. We think these are both fair assumptions," the note stated.

IAG's valuation appears the second-least demanding across each of the metrics. It trades at a 26% premium to its 
NAV.
The medium-term EBIT margin implied by its current share price is 3.7 points lower than its five-year average EBIT.
Its EV now is 4% lower than its pre-pandemic level. These metrics imply sustained future value creation and that 
the company has stronger prospects than before the pandemic, the bank stated.
Easyjet's valuation appears the least demanding across each of the metrics. It trades at a 5% premium to its NAV. 
The medium-term EBIT margin implied by its current share price is 3.7 points lower than its five-year average EBIT. 
Its EV now is 14% lower than pre-pandemic level.
Separately, Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo noted that Easyjet's stock price may offer better value than Ryanair's, 
with the latter's fundamental strengths remaining "attractive, but are priced in at its current share price".    Khoo said 
that Ryanair remains the market leader in European short-haul aviation, with low unit costs, cost flexibility and a 
strong balance sheet.    "However, we believe these strengths are adequately reflected in the share price, even with 
the greater optimism created by the prospect of a Covid vaccine and the group's bullish fleet plan and passenger 
growth targets," he said.   A key part of Liberum's recent shift to a positive stance on Easyjet was confidence the 
group is dealing with pre-pandemic concerns about non-fuel unit costs and poor free cash flow. Overheads are 
being cut, seasonal bases and staff contracts are being introduced, and capital expenditure is being scaled back.
Easyjet's 2021 Capex is now at £600 million ($801 million) versus £950 million planned a year ago; for 2020 it is 
planned at £600 million to £800 million, versus £1.2 billion expected this time last year.

Mike Clements kicks off new fund with ‘stock you love to hate’
Mike Clements kicks off new fund with ‘stock you love to hate’

Byline: Chris Sloley
Highlight: Former Syz manager’s new venture set to take advantage of value rally with allocation to surprising 
income names.
Body
Mike Clements is keen to keep his contrarian ethos alive with the launch of his new unconstrained European equity 
income fund, by kicking it off with a focus on several ‘unloved’ names.
Clements joined UK group Downing Fund Managers in November after stepping down from Syz Group, where he 
had been head of European equities up until his departure in June.
In his new venture, which he will co-run with Pras Jeyanandhan, Clements will focus the VT Downing European 
Unconstrained Income fund on undervalued companies, most notably budget airline Ryanair.
‘While we don’t class ourselves value investors per se, the recent run on value and recovery stocks which followed 
the announcement of Pfizer’s and Moderna’s successful vaccine trials, could set an entirely new backdrop for 
investing both in Europe and more globally.
‘Without getting too much into our investment process, we look for two types of companies in our portfolio; 
contrarian opportunities and under the radar companies. We essentially look for what we consider to be 
undervalued companies which you won’t typically find in the large-cap dividend paying sectors.’
Clements, who branded Ryanair ‘a stock everyone loves to hate’, said it remains the best airline in Europe. He said 
the stock price has obviously been hit by lockdown and limitations on flights but this will not last forever and the 
stock will inevitably rebound.
‘The investment case for Ryanair is a well-known one, however there are often times when investors get scared 
over a company’s short-term prospects. As long-term investors, taking a five-year view, we still believe Ryanair is 
going to take market share away from competitors such as British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France. We think it is 
a long-term winner and right now we can buy it cheaply simply because there is fear in the market.’
Focusing on confidence and patience, Clements said Ryanair is a classic undervalued stock, which has undergone 
huge share price movements, rocking from €12-per-share to €16 in the week of various vaccine announcements.
Mike Clements kicks off new fund with ‘stock you love to hate’
‘When I think about what contrarian investing looks like in practice, there are two legs of performance to consider. 
The first is what has happened in the last few weeks, which we can call a knee-jerk, sentiment-driven relief rally. 
This is exactly what has happened to many travel and leisure stocks since a potential solution to Covid-19 was 
announced.’
Clements said he had focused on Ryanair as opposed to larger carriers, namely British Airways, as government 
bailouts and other support systems meant the competitive dynamics had changed considerably.
‘The acid test of a high-quality business is one that can come through a crisis not only unscathed, but in a stronger 
position than it went into it. We believe Ryanair is a classic example of this, and love or hate it, it is around to stay.’
Linked to the return of air travel, Clements also name-checked Spanish travel technology company Amadeus, 
which is the booking engine behind airline ticket sales. He said the stock shares many characteristics with Ryanair 
and had been closely watched since March.

Amelia International (NL, Ljubljana) has signed a one-way code-share partnership with Air France (AF, Paris CDG) 
covering both of its independent scheduled routes, from Paris Orly to Clermont-Ferrand and Rodez. The Slovenian 
regional specialist, which is owned by France's Regourd Aviation (Paris Le Bourget), has an established wet-lease 
partnership with the flag carrier. According to the ch-aviation fleets advanced module, it operates services from Orly 
to Aurillac, Brive-la-Gaillarde Vallée de la Dordogne, Castres, and Lourdes/Tarbes on behalf of Air France using a 
mix of ATR42-500 and E145 aircraft. 
However, its two in-house services have thus far not been integrated into Air France's network. All of Air France's 
frequent flyer benefits will also be extended to Amelia flights, as part of the partnership. Amelia International 
operates both in-house routes 11x weekly in its regular schedule, the ch-aviation schedules module shows. 
However, due to ongoing movement restrictions in France, it currently flies only 3x weekly to Rodez (using the 
Embraer regional jets). Flights to Clermont-Ferrand were suspended at the end of October 2020, Flightradar24 
ADS-B data shows. Amelia is the sole carrier serving Rodez on a scheduled basis. Clermont-Ferrand sees Air 
France services to Paris CDG, operated by HOP!, as well as scheduled Ryanair services to Porto. Separately, 
Amelia International announced that it would operate five scheduled flights from Clermont-Ferrand to each of Nice 
and Paris-Orly between December 19, 2020, and January 3, 2021. These services will cater to an expected uptick 
in domestic demand around the holiday period.

partnership with the flag carrier. According to the ch-aviation fleets advanced module, it operates services from Orly 
to Aurillac, Brive-la-Gaillarde Vallée de la Dordogne, Castres, and Lourdes/Tarbes on behalf of Air France using a 
mix of ATR42-500 and E145 aircraft. 
However, its two in-house services have thus far not been integrated into Air France's network. All of Air France's 
frequent flyer benefits will also be extended to Amelia flights, as part of the partnership. Amelia International 
operates both in-house routes 11x weekly in its regular schedule, the ch-aviation schedules module shows. 
However, due to ongoing movement restrictions in France, it currently flies only 3x weekly to Rodez (using the 
Embraer regional jets). Flights to Clermont-Ferrand were suspended at the end of October 2020, Flightradar24 
ADS-B data shows. Amelia is the sole carrier serving Rodez on a scheduled basis. Clermont-Ferrand sees Air 
France services to Paris CDG, operated by HOP!, as well as scheduled Ryanair services to Porto. Separately, 
Amelia International announced that it would operate five scheduled flights from Clermont-Ferrand to each of Nice 
and Paris-Orly between December 19, 2020, and January 3, 2021. These services will cater to an expected uptick 
in domestic demand around the holiday period.

 Japanese airline ANA (9202.T) unveiled plans on Friday to sell up to 332.1 billion yen ($3.18 billion) of shares to 
pay for Boeing (BA) aircraft while bolstering its finances amid the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The carrier plans to sell 140 million shares by way of an offering of new shares as well as third-party allotment, 
according to a statement.
Shares will be sold in a public offering in Japan as well as through an international offering of 35 million shares 
targeting global investors.
The company said of the total money raised, 200 billion yen was set to be deployed through March 31, 2023, for 
capital expenditure to generate "medium to long-term growth." It includes the purchase of two models of Boeing 787 
aircraft to "optimize" demand with supply in the years ahead as well as reduce the carrier's environmental footprint. 
Airlines such as Ryanair (RYAAY) in Ireland, the biggest budget carrier in Europe, have said they expect pre-
coronavirus level of demand to return by 2023.
The remainder of the capital raised will be used to repay long-term debt through March 31, 2023, and strengthen 
the airline's ability to tolerate risk.
The planned offering includes a 180-day lock up period on ANA for issuing more shares.

robust Battery Management System (BMS) solutions is a positive. Further, growing power design wins are major 
positives. Notably, it plans to acquire Maxim Integrated. The deal is expected to drive Analog Devices  growth 
across several emerging growth markets. Additionally, rising adoption of advanced radio systems in 5G

Business travellers coming into England for trips of up to three days could be exempt from the quarantine system 
under new plans floated by the government yesterday.
A cross-departmental Global Travel Taskforce said in a report that the exemption could be introduced in early 2021, 
although the business visitors would be banned from any socialising while in England.
The body, chaired by health secretary Matt Hancock and transport secretary Grant Shapps, recommended a 
consultation with clinicians and industry to see if the policy would be practicable and how it might be administered.
"The task force heard that business travel is expected to recover most slowly and that there is a clear need to boost 
confidence," the report said. "An exemption for short-term business trips from the need to self-isolate on arrival 
would clearly have a major beneficial impact in supporting such journeys, which make an important economic 
contribution to the UK."
The report noted that visits lasting up to three nights are the most common length of stay for business trips, 
accounting for 62 per cent of those in 2018.
Claire Walker, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the move. "A quarantine 
exemption for business travel will help to re-establish connections to key markets and trade partners across the 
world, helping firms that depend on the UK's connectivity and preserving industries and livelihoods," she said.

The task force said it was also considering an exemption for groups of overseas tourists if they stayed in "tour 
bubbles" of the sort used by sports teams and only travelled together in private vehicles. But it said that cruises 
should not be resumed until the national Covid-19 alert level dropped from its current mark of four to three or even 
two. The news came as Mr Shapps announced that the quarantine system for travellers coming into England would 
be cut from 14 to five days. The new quarantine regime, which will allow travellers coming from abroad to pay for 
their own test after five days of self-isolation, was welcomed by much of the travel industry yesterday. But 
executives said they wanted ministers to go further to help people travel ahead of a potentially busy Christmas 
season.
But Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary called the UK's quarantine measures a "fig leaf that doesn't work". 
Quarantine is "completely unpoliceable; the police cannot enforce a quarantine", Mr O'Leary told the BBC.
"Test before they arrive, not five days after they arrive," he said, adding that the police did not have the resources to 
check people were self-isolating.

7:31 p.m. ET  First Published: Nov. 24, 2020 at 3:40 p.m. ET Trade group IATA is in the final stages of developing 
digital 'travel pass' to enable international travel without quarantine measures International arrivals to England will 
be able to reduce quarantine times with a private COVID test beginning Dec. 15.  tolga akmen/Agence France-
Presse/Getty Images  Thinking of traveling to England for Christmas?
 You'll soon be able to cut your quarantine period by more than half — but only if you pay up to 120 ($160) for a 
COVID test. Under the U.K. government's new 'Test to Release' [1]strategy, which comes into force on Dec. 15, 
passengers arriving from countries with high infection rates can cut their quarantine from 14 days[2] to five, if they 
test negative for coronavirus on the fifth day.Passengers who choose that option will need to book a test before 
travel and pay for it privately from a list of government-approved suppliers, with results usually provided in 24 to 48 
hours. The tests are expected to cost between 65 and 120. That works out at 325 to 600 ($800) for a family of five. 
Read: How safe is flying during COVID? 5 questions to ask before getting on a plane [3] Those choosing not to take 
a test when arriving from a country not on the government's travel corridors listmust continue to follow the self-
isolation[4] requirement of two weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the strategy would 'bolster 
international travel while keeping the public safe.' 'Our new testing strategy will allow us to travel more freely, see 
loved ones and drive international business. By giving people the choice to test on Day 5, we are also supporting 
the travel industry as it continues to rebuild out of the pandemic,' Shapps said. The news helped lift travel stocks in 
Europe. Shares in easyJet EZJ, +7.77%[5] rose 5.76%, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines 
IAG, +2.40%[6] was up 5.23%, while Ryanair's RYAAY, +0.29%[7] stock moved 1.61% higher in early London 
trading on Tuesday. 'The FTSE 250 had another good day, rising 0.9% with leisure stocks in demand including a 
9% rise in TUI TUI, +15.85%[8] and a 6% rise in Carnival CCL, +10.53%[9], with many households now hoping that 
foreign holidays will once again become a reality rather than a fantasy,' said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ 
Bell. Test to Release was welcomed by the travel industry, which has been fighting for survival as travel disruption 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to drag on profits. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body 
Airlines U.K., said the strategy was a 'hugely welcome step that will begin the process of opening up international 
travel and restarting U.K. aviation.' But he cautioned that a test at day five 'does not get rid of quarantine,' and 
: U.K.'s 'Test to Release' option can cut travelers' quarantine time to five days — and make Christmas in 
England a possibility again
urged the government to move toward a pre-departure or domestic testing regime that can remove safely the need 
for self-isolation altogether, as quickly as possible.  'This is the only way we're going to comprehensively reopen the 
market. But, with this announcement there is now light at the end of the tunnel not just for carriers and U.K. aviation 
but consumers looking to get away at Christmas and beyond.'  Read:United Airlines tests COVID-19 'health pass' to 
kick-start global travel again[10]  Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association said it is in the final 
development phase of a digital health pass that will support the safe reopening of borders. The IATA Travel 
Pass[11], will manage and verify the secure flow of necessary testing or vaccine information among governments, 
airlines, laboratories and travelers. 'Today borders are double locked. Testing is the first key to enable international 
travel without quarantine measures,' said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA chief executive and director general. 'The 
second key is the global information infrastructure needed to securely manage, share and verify test data matched 
with traveler identities in compliance with border-control requirements.'  Read: American Airlines and British 
Airways trial free COVID testing on trans-Atlantic flights in boost to travel [12]  Last week, American Airlines AAL, 
+9.29%[13] and British Airwayslaunched a coronavirus-testing trial in an effort to persuade the U.S. and U.K. 
governments that testing can restart international travel and remove the need for passengers to quarantine on 
arrival.  On Tuesday, the government also announced financial support for struggling airports in England and the 
ground handlers serving them.  The support, which starts in 2021, will address fixed costsand be equivalent to the 
business rates liabilities of each business, capped atup to 8 million per site, and subject to certain conditions.  From 
the archives (October 2020): Heathrow boss was hopeful of London-New York air bridge by Thanksgiving [14] 
Heathrow said in October that it has lost its position [15]as Europe's busiest airport for the first time, after being 
overtaken by Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, following the unprecedented slump in global demand for air travel.  
The airport said November is likely to be even worse[16]. 'Long-haul and critical markets for trade suffered the 
worst declines due to the Government's debilitating quarantine requirements' it said in a statement on Nov. 11. The

 Ryanair's (RYA.L) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary on Tuesday criticized the UK government's plans to 
carry out air passenger testing in a move to shorten the quarantine periods and encourage traveling amid COVID-
19, Sky News reported the same day.
O'Leary said the new policy is another step in the "mismanagement" of the situation and it would have been "much 
simpler" if passengers were tested within 72 hours of their departure instead of after arriving in the country.
The disgruntled CEO, however, is optimistic that the cost of COVID-19 tests will decline and a potential vaccine will 
be available for commercial use by April 2021.
The airline's shares decreased marginally at the end of trading on Tuesday.

 European low-cost airline Ryanair (RYAAY) will fly fewer passengers than planned this winter, and doesn't expect 
a return to pre-pandemic levels of service until next fall, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing the company's chief 
executive.
The Irish airline said earlier this month it expected to transport 38 million passengers in its financial year to March 
31. But that is now likely to fall to "the mid-30s," Reuters quoted Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary as saying 
in an interview.
In the next year, Ryanair could fly between 80 million and 130 million passengers, depending on progress in the 
roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying.
The airline currently expects to fly between 60% and 80% of last year's capacity for much of next year, falling to 
60%-70% during the peak summer period, Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying. By the end of the summer and 
towards winter 2021 the company expects to return to service levels it has seen in all of its 2019 schedules, he 
added.

Qantas plans to require vaccine jabs before flights

Qantas plans to insist that passengers on international flights have been vaccinated against Covid-19 before 
boarding its planes once any jab is rolled out.
Alan Joyce, the Australian airline's chief executive, said he thought a vaccine would become "a necessity" for 
international travel. "We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travellers, we will 
ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft," he told Channel 9. "I think that's going to be a 
common thing talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe," he said.
Qantas is the first big airline to publicly raise the possibility of refusing travel to unvaccinated passengers. The 
pandemic prompted Australia to close its borders to non-residents, and Qantas has suspended international flights 
except for a skeleton schedule to New Zealand. It does not expect to reopen most of them until mid-2021.
Vaccine breakthroughs in the past two weeks have raised hopes that international travel could start to recover in 
2021 but they have also provoked questions about how the health status of would-be passengers will be verified.
Yesterday Oxford university and AstraZeneca became the third team of vaccine developers to announce their jab 
had been shown to be effective in late-stage trials.
David Powell, medical adviser to Iata, the airline industry body, said there was a "really strong possibility" that 
countries would start to demand proof of health status from travellers, particularly in areas with low prevalence of 
the virus such as Australia.
Qantas plans to require vaccine jabs before flights
"Being able to have verifiable information about the health status of passengers, I think that is going to be critical," 
he said yesterday.
Tony Douglas, Etihad chief executive, told the Financial Times in September that health visas certifying that 
passengers were safe to fly could help the airline industry recover from the crisis. Several digital health passes 
have since been developed, including the World Economic Forum-backed CommonPass. Iata said it was 
developing a pass with IAG, owner of British Airways. EasyJet said it had no plans to demand proof of vaccination 
before travel. IAG and Virgin Atlantic declined to comment. Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment.

Qantas plans to insist that passengers on international flights have been vaccinated against Covid-19 before 
boarding its planes once any jab is rolled out.
Alan Joyce, the Australian airline's chief executive, said he thought a vaccine would become "a necessity" for 
international travel. "We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travellers, we will 
ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft," he told Channel 9. "I think that's going to be a 
common thing talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe," he said.
Qantas is the first big airline to publicly raise the possibility of refusing travel to unvaccinated passengers. The 
pandemic prompted Australia to close its borders to non-residents, and Qantas has suspended international flights 
except for a skeleton schedule to New Zealand. It does not expect to reopen most of them until mid-2021.
Vaccine breakthroughs in the past two weeks have raised hopes that international travel could start to recover in 
2021 but they have also provoked questions about how the health status of would-be passengers will be verified.
Yesterday Oxford university and AstraZeneca became the third team of vaccine developers to announce their jab 
had been shown to be effective in late-stage trials.
David Powell, medical adviser to Iata, the airline industry body, said there was a "really strong possibility" that 
countries would start to demand proof of health status from travellers, particularly in areas with low prevalence of 
the virus such as Australia.
Qantas plans to require vaccine jabs before flights
"Being able to have verifiable information about the health status of passengers, I think that is going to be critical," 
he said yesterday.
Tony Douglas, Etihad chief executive, told the Financial Times in September that health visas certifying that 
passengers were safe to fly could help the airline industry recover from the crisis. Several digital health passes 
have since been developed, including the World Economic Forum-backed CommonPass. Iata said it was 
developing a pass with IAG, owner of British Airways. EasyJet said it had no plans to demand proof of vaccination 
before travel. IAG and Virgin Atlantic declined to comment. Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) is expecting its Novermber's flight load factor to be "down somewhere in the mid 60%" range, 
Reuters reported Tuesday citing Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
The decline from October's 73% comes following the imposition of new COVID-19 lockdown restrictions to curb the 
spread of the second wave of infections.
The airline's shares increased about 3% on Tuesday morning.

Recent COVID-19 lockdowns mean Ryanair will fly fewer passengers than planned this winter and Europe's biggest 
low-cost airline doesn't expect to return to pre-pandemic levels of service until next autumn, its chief executive said 
on Tuesday.
The Irish airline said earlier this month it expected to fly 38 million passengers in its financial year to March 31. That 
is now likely to fall to "the mid-30s," Group CEO Michael O'Leary said in an interview.
In the following year, Ryanair could fly anywhere between 80 million and 130 million passengers, depending on how 
the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines progress, he said.
O'Leary said the group expected to fly between 60% and 80% of last year's capacity for much of next year, falling to 
60-70% during the peak summer period.
"But I think by the time we get to the end of the summer into winter 2021 we expect to be back to pretty much close 
to all of our 2019 schedules," he said. (Reuters)

Nov 23, 2020( 24/7 Wall St.: http://www.247wallst.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Aerospace &#38; Defense  The 
European Union's civil aviation regulator is prepared to recertify the Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA[1]) 737 Max passenger 
jet to return to service in January, according to the agency's director.  In an interview with a French newspaper on 
Saturday, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) head Patrick Ky said the agency's studies 'show us that the 
plane can return to service' and that it is 'likely' that the agency will decide in January to put the plane back into 
service. 
Ky's statement follows last Wednesday's announcement from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that 
the grounding order on the 737 Max[2] issued in March of 2019 had been rescinded and that the planes could begin 
flying again after meeting certain other guidelines. The major change to recertification in both the United States and 
Europe is that the two civil authorities will conduct their own safety assessments of Boeing airplanes and that those 
assessments will occur earlier in the certification process.The FAA will require that each airplane be certified by the 
agency rather than by Boeing, as had been past practice. The agency took a lot of heat from congressional 
investigations for allowing Boeing personnel to conduct final inspections of the planes before they were delivered to 
customers. The EASA recertification means that Boeing can once again begin to deliver planes to European airlines 
and, critically for Boeing, get paid. Ireland-based Ryanair, for example, has unfilled orders for 135 of the planes, 
and leasing firm AerCap has 71 unfilled orders. Boeing still faces some headwinds. Transport Canada, that 
country's airline regulator, has not yet approved the 737 Max for recertification. In the past, the Canadian agency 
generally followed FAA certification decisions, but Transport Minister Marc Garneau said last week that there will be 
differences this time between FAA and Canadian requirements. Three Canadian airlines have unfilled orders for a 
total of 69 737 Max aircraft. Another major market for Boeing, China, has remained silent on lifting its grounding 
order on the 737 Max. China was the first country to ground the 737 in 2019, and the country's Civil Aviation 
Administration (CAAC) already has said that Boeing will have to meet the CAAC requirements before the planes 
can fly again. Boeing's most recent orders and deliveries report indicates that Chinese airlines have unfilled orders 
for 104 new planes. Boeing's problems with China go beyond the safety of the 737 Max. Teal Group analyst 
Richard Aboulafia told CNN recently that Boeing is not in control of its fate in China: 'In China, Boeing is prisoner to 
forces beyond mere aviation market dynamics. It would be impossible for Boeing to not be wrapped up in this giant 
mess, involving trade barriers, [intellectual property] disputes, and tariffs.' Because China plays such a large role[3] 
in the growth of the passenger plane market, Boeing has got to come up with a way to regain a solid foothold in the 
Boeing 737 Max On Track to Fly in Europe Again
country. Boeing stock traded up about 2% shortly after the opening bell Monday, at $203.37 in a 52-week range of 
$89.00 to $374.77. The price target on the stock is $200.55. ALSO READ: Top Wall Street Strategist Has 5 Stocks

After years of double digit growth, Wizz Air's seat count dropped by 43% in the first 10 months of 2020. This 
compares with a 55% capacity drop for all of Europe.
Wizz Air returned capacity more aggressively than the market when it emerged from its grounding in the Jul-Sep 
quarter. However, the ultra LCC has applied the brakes following renewed lockdown and travel restrictions, and 
capacity is now below the European average as a percentage of 2019 levels.
In spite of reduced near term capacity plans, Wizz Air expects there to be opportunities in the crisis. Its fleet will 
increase by 13% in FY2021 and more than double by FY2027. Its seat share has grown in its Central/Eastern 
Europe core market and it is opening 13 new bases across Europe, from the UK to Russia. Further new markets 
will be added by Wizz Air Dubai, which now expects to launch in Dec-2020.
Moreover, Wizz Air can afford to wait out any extension of the period of weak demand. CEO Jo zsef Va radi has 
said that its cash balance is enough to last for two years, even with a full lockdown and no flying.
Summary:
Wizz Air returned capacity faster than the market in the Jul-Sep quarter, but is now below the European market as a 
percentage of 2019 levels.
Ryanair was the only leading European airline group with a better Apr-Sep operating margin than Wizz Air. Wizz Air 
has the strongest liquidity.
Wizz Air's capacity plans are reduced, but it foresees opportunities in the crisis. Its fleet will increase by 13% in 
FY2021 and more than double by FY2027.
Wizz Air Abu Dhabi is operationally ready, but its launch has been pushed back to mid Dec-2020.

Ryanair Holdings would consider acquiring A320-200Ns and A321-200Ns for its newly formed Maltese subsidiary 
Lauda Europe (LW, Malta Int'l) but only if Airbus makes the right offer, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said 
during a virtual interview at the WTM London trade fair. "I am still hopeful and still optimistic that we can reach a 
deal with Airbus on price. The challenge though, is and this is one for Airbus, is they've got to be able to match 
Boeing's pricing... And if it doesn't match what we have on Boeing, then you know, regrettably, I think we'll finish up 
getting rid of the Airbuses out of Lauda altogether," he said. 
The Maltese carrier currently operates a fleet of 34 used A320-200s taken over from its predecessor Lauda (OE, 
Vienna), which also added them as pre-owned aircraft, the ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows. It is the only 
Airbus operator in Ryanair Group, which also comprises B737-800-only carriers Ryanair, Ryanair UK, Malta Air, 
and Buzz. When taking over Lauda, then known as LaudaMotion, Ryanair was planning to use the Austrian carrier 
as leverage to negotiate better prices with OEMs, shedding its image of a Boeing-only operator. However, O'Leary 
has now acknowledged that after having developed a very close relationship to Boeing, the LCC would struggle to 
get similarly good deals from Airbus. Ryanair Group operates a total of 603 B737-800s, as well as a single B737-
700 used for corporate charters. The group has 135 B737-8-200s on firm order from Boeing with deliveries 
expected to commence next year, following the recertification of the B737 MAX family. Meanwhile, in another panel 
during the ACI Europe annual meeting, O'Leary said Ryanair was eager to expand at "progressive" airports which 
offer good incentives for traffic growth in the post-COVID period. He expects low-cost traffic will return to pre-
COVIDs level by Summer 2022, although prices will take longer to rebound. He underlined that among the airports 
that Ryanair is looking at as potential bases include several Italian gateways, such as Turin, Venice Treviso, and 
Verona. Ryanair already has 16 bases in Italy and the country is its largest market with a 22.1% share by departure 
capacity in the LCC's current network.

Norwegian seeks bankruptcy protection Airlines Carrier aims to reorganise under Irish law with view to cutting 
$5.3bn debt pile
Norwegian seeks bankruptcy protection; Airlines Carrier aims to reorganise 
under Irish law with view to cutting $5.3bn debt pile

Norwegian Air Shuttle is to file for protection from creditors under the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11, becoming the 
industry's largest pandemic casualty.
The carrier said yesterday that two of its subsidiaries would file for examinership in Ireland, a reorganisation 
process akin to Chapter 11 in the US.
The airline said it would use the reorganisation to cut its NKr48bn ($5.3bn) debt pile, offload aircraft, and raise 
capital in a process expected to take up to five months.
"Seeking protection to reorganise under Irish law is a decision that we have taken to secure the future of Norwegian 
for the benefit of our employees, customers and investors," said Jacob Schram, chief executive. "Our aim is to find 
solutions with our stakeholders that will allow us to emerge as a financially stronger and secure airline." The airline's 
fate was sealed last week when Norway's government refused to give it a second bailout this year.
Ministers said they did not think it was a "sound use" of taxpayers' money to prop up an airline that entered the 
crisis as one of the most vulnerable carriers due to a debt-fuelled expansion into long-haul flights.
Founded in 1992 by former fighter pilot Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian turned into a rival of Ryanair and easyJet in the past 
two decades as it expanded from its Nordic base into low-cost travel in Europe and then flights to the US and Asia.
Norwegian seeks bankruptcy protection Airlines Carrier aims to reorganise under Irish law with view to cutting 
$5.3bn debt pile
Lars-Daniel Westby, an analyst at SpareBank 1 Markets in Norway, who last week told the Financial Times that 
Norwegian was likely to file for bankruptcy in Ireland or the US, has said that it could split into a profitable short-haul 
European operation and a lossmaking long-haul business.
Norwegian said it would try to continue operating as normal with its current route network, which is severely limited 
by Covid-19 to a few domestic flights in Norway.
The airline said it believed that it had enough cash to get through examinership, which grants companies 100 days 
of protection from creditors to put together a rescue plan, subject to High Court approval.
Mr Schram said: "Our intent is clear. We will emerge from this process as a more financially secure and competitive 
airline, with a new financial structure, a right-sized fleet and improved customer offering."
Norwegian converted NKr18bn ($2bn) from debt to equity under an earlier government-backed rescue plan, but still 
had NKr48bn of debt at the end of September.
Arctic Aviation Assets, a Norwegian subsidiary based in Dublin, handles aircraft financing and ownership for the 
airline, making Ireland an obvious location for its reorganisation.

Norwegian Air Shuttle is to file for protection from creditors under the Irish equivalent of Chapter 11, becoming the 
industry's largest pandemic casualty.
The carrier said yesterday that two of its subsidiaries would file for examinership in Ireland, a reorganisation 
process akin to Chapter 11 in the US.
The airline said it would use the reorganisation to cut its NKr48bn ($5.3bn) debt pile, offload aircraft, and raise 
capital in a process expected to take up to five months.
"Seeking protection to reorganise under Irish law is a decision that we have taken to secure the future of Norwegian 
for the benefit of our employees, customers and investors," said Jacob Schram, chief executive. "Our aim is to find 
solutions with our stakeholders that will allow us to emerge as a financially stronger and secure airline." The airline's 
fate was sealed last week when Norway's government refused to give it a second bailout this year.
Ministers said they did not think it was a "sound use" of taxpayers' money to prop up an airline that entered the 
crisis as one of the most vulnerable carriers due to a debt-fuelled expansion into long-haul flights.
Founded in 1992 by former fighter pilot Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian turned into a rival of Ryanair and easyJet in the past 
two decades as it expanded from its Nordic base into low-cost travel in Europe and then flights to the US and Asia.

$5.3bn debt pile
Lars-Daniel Westby, an analyst at SpareBank 1 Markets in Norway, who last week told the Financial Times that 
Norwegian was likely to file for bankruptcy in Ireland or the US, has said that it could split into a profitable short-haul 
European operation and a lossmaking long-haul business.
Norwegian said it would try to continue operating as normal with its current route network, which is severely limited 
by Covid-19 to a few domestic flights in Norway.
The airline said it believed that it had enough cash to get through examinership, which grants companies 100 days 
of protection from creditors to put together a rescue plan, subject to High Court approval.
Mr Schram said: "Our intent is clear. We will emerge from this process as a more financially secure and competitive 
airline, with a new financial structure, a right-sized fleet and improved customer offering."
Norwegian converted NKr18bn ($2bn) from debt to equity under an earlier government-backed rescue plan, but still 
had NKr48bn of debt at the end of September.

airline, making Ireland an obvious location for its reorganisation.

Nov 19, 2020( Capital Mind: http://www.capitalmind.in Delivered by Newstex)  Global aviation stocks have been 
flying high as positive news of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine fuelled hopes of a rebound in air traffic. Among the top-10 
listed airlines globally, IndiGo is leading the charge as one of two large airlines with higher market cap than this time 
last year. Share prices of InterGlobe Aviation not only touched its 52-week high but is also comfortably trading 
above pre-Covid levels. We took a look to see what it means for current and potential investors.Indigo (Interglobe 
Aviation) stock has gained the most since last year compared to global airlines. 
Indigo is followed by the European low-cost airline Ryanair.The rally in share price is on the back of: peaking of the 
pandemic situation in India, improving trends in daily traffic, market share gains, and positive developments related 
to Covid vaccine However, what investors are overlooking: Air traffic is still less than half of last year, Airfares are 
low, PLFs are still low, Competitive intensity is and will remain high, Covid cases rising at a lower rate, but still 
rising, Cut in corporate travel, and Macro environment remains challengingPeaking PandemicIndia's Covid-19 hit a 
record peak in the middle of September when it reported more than a million active cases. Since then the number of 
daily cases has been steadily declining. A group of India's top scientists believes that the pandemic can be 
controlled by February next year. However, before that, there could be a second wave of infections if caution is 
thrown to the wind during the festival season. All such models assume the obvious: people will wear masks, avoid 
large gatherings, maintain social distancing, and wash hands. The fear of boarding a cylindrical box packed with too 
many people is going to keep peak occupancy away till such time as a vaccine is administered to most of the 
population - which will take time.Daily Air TrafficAccording to the data provided on the DGCA website, air traffic in 
India has been on an increasing trend. The average number of daily passengers flying has jumped nearly three 
times in the last six months. Vaccine HopesIndiGo's share prices joined a global rally as vaccine results fuelled 
optimism of an exit from the pandemic. Indian shares rallied to a record in the ceremonial evening session to mark 
Diwali on the hopes of vaccine and as earnings of some of the country's biggest companies bolstered optimism for 
a faster economic recovery. India's key equity indexes have risen about 10% since last Diwali even as consumption 
was quashed by the world's biggest lockdown, aimed at quelling the virus.Market Share GainsAccording to the data 
from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, there has been some shift in the airline market share in favour of 
IndiGo. This is because smaller players - Vistara, AirAsia, and GoAir - are flying less in an effort to conserve cash. 
Also, there is no pressure from airports for slots utilisation. Overlooked DownsidesThough the air traffic in India is 
rising, it is still half of what it was last year. In November 2020, so far on average, the daily air traffic has been close 
What's the Story with IndiGo Valuations FlyingHigh?
to 1.9 lakh, as compared to 4.3 lakh last year. IndiGo's valuations seem to overlook this fact.The recent rise in air 
traffic could be on the back of low-ticket prices, more capacity being deployed and the onset of the festive season in 
India. Air ticket prices in India over the last two months also reflect the structurally low demand. Ticket prices in 12 
major routes in India have either remained unchanged or have fallen in the last month. Even during the festive 
season, with more people flying, the ticket prices have remained largely unchanged.The growth in air traffic is also 
led by more capacity being deployed. The number of departures per day has increased by 10% in November 
compared to last month, while the average number of fliers per departure has increased by 3%. Compared to June, 
average daily departures have jumped 2.4 times, while fliers per departure have increased by only 1.2 times. This 
growth in air traffic led by more capacity being deployed has largely led to a fall in the passenger load factor - 
capacity utilisation - for airlines in India.Thus, the industry dynamics, have changed from higher and/or stable 
utilisation and ticket prices and growing air traffic, to lower utilisation and ticket prices and growing air traffic. The 
downtrend of two out of three factors, which generally lead to a strong financial performance for an airline, is been 
overlooked by IndiGo's current valuations. At the start of the pandemic, the market was expecting consolidation in 
the aviation industry, due to the weak liquidity conditions of few airlines in India. However, nothing has changed 
even eight months into a pandemic. There has been some shift in market shares but that looks temporary. It seems 
as if IndiGo's investors have placed their bets on the possible benefit to IndiGo from consolidation in the industry. 
Smaller and weaker carriers have sustained the pandemic by implementing stringent cost-saving measures and by 
negotiations with suppliers for a reduction in rentals to preserve liquidity. SpiceJet which seemed to be one of the 
most vulnerable airlines with an anaemic balance sheet has sustained by deferring vendor payments, cutting costs 
and focusing more on its cargo business where demand has been much stronger than usual. Going forward, the 
company is expected to get stronger as 737 Max returns to operations. SpiceJet should start getting incentives for 
every aircraft as part of the sales and leaseback agreement of its 737 Max aircraft order. With potential 
compensation from Boeing and cash incentives with every aircraft, the company might get the required liquidity to 
stay afloat and to improve its balance sheet. The return of 737 Max would also improve its cost structure. Among 
the other players, GoAir with its new leadership team is striving hard to get its pre-covid level of market share. The 
company has been able to grow its market share from 3.8% to 6.7% as of September.The Air India Stake SaleAir 
India on the other hand, has been running its operations smoothly with a 10% domestic market share, even as the 
Government of India is struggling to find a buyer for the same. A successful sale would turn fat into muscle, 
increasing competition for incumbents, while a 'no-sale' is most likely to mean continued government support, in line 
with other loss-making PSUs. The government has been trying to sell Air India for the past few years. Previously, 
when the government tried to sell Air India, the terms and the shape in which the government wanted to sell Air 
India were not sufficiently attractive to any of the potential buyers. Hence the government has sweetened the deal 
this time and has decided to be more flexible with the terms.Tata Group partially owns and runs two airlines - 
AirAsia and Vistara - in India. Both these airlines have been able to regain most of their market share. The 
Malaysian promoter of AirAsia has indicated that it could exit India owing to financial distress. However, the Tata 
Group is in discussions to buy the stake. On the other hand, Vistara - which is jointly owned by Tata and Singapore 
Airlines - is looking to expand its operations by possibly acquiring Air India, according to media reports. This 
indicates that the consolidation event in the Indian aviation industry is unlikely. In fact the competitive intensity could 
rise if demand growth continues to lag the supply growth. Again, the valuations of IndiGo seem to overlook this 
concern.Risks to this ValuationCovid-19 in India might have peaked, and the number of daily cases has been 
declining steadily, but the total number of cases and deaths have still been rising. This has restricted flyers from 
flying. Moreover, with the ongoing festive season, the number of infections could well rise to go ahead. Kerala, for 
instance, recorded a sharp uptick in cases in September following celebrations of Onam, a harvest festival. Delhi 
has been witnessing a sudden spike in coronavirus disease cases since October 28 due to the festive season, the 
opening of essential services, and allowing the movement of people. This phenomenon, if witnessed across 
different states, could push the Indian Government towards a second lockdown. Even globally, many nations have 
announced a second lockdown as a new wave of infections sweeps through their nations. This means that the 
uncertainty around normalcy of international travel still persists. Along with this, commentary from corporates 
suggests that travel is one of the cost lines that may get cut on a sustainable basis. This implies that business travel 
- half of the total domestic travel - may take much longer to recover. Thus, the continued rise in Covid-19 cases 
makes it difficult to pinpoint when normalcy would return. And these concerns to have been ignored by IndiGo's 
current valuations.There is no doubt that IndiGo is a well-run business and is one of the best-placed airlines in 
India. It has a 50%+ market share and a strong balance sheet. However, the question is does the fundamentals and 
What's the Story with IndiGo Valuations FlyingHigh?
the current challenging macro environment justify such expensive valuations. The overall liquidity rush has driven 
up the share prices, but the fact remains the same that at current levels the stock is expensive as the path forward 
doesn't look so smooth. As such, investors would do well to exercise some caution.This article is for information

EasyJet in fresh plea for further state backing after £1.3bn loss Airlines
EasyJet in fresh plea for further state backing after £1.3bn loss; Airlines

EasyJet has slumped to a £1.3bn annual loss, the first in its 25-year history, as the industry crisis shows few signs 
of easing.
The carrier yesterday said it expected to fly a fifth of its normal schedule for the rest of this year, as it tried to keep 
losses to a minimum.
With demand expected to be low even over the traditionally busy Christmas period and recovery hopes delayed 
until next year at the earliest, chief executive Johan Lundgren again called for more government support.
Mr Lundgren, who has repeatedly pressed for more government backing in the past few weeks, said he would 
welcome new state loans or removal of air passenger duty to stimulate demand.
Although he stopped short of calling for direct cash injections into UK airlines, he noted that some continental 
carriers had received billions of euros in support. "I am concerned funds are being very unevenly distributed around 
the network to some of these airlines. We are having a constructive dialogue with the government."
The company had announced earlier an extension to repayment of a £600m government rescue loan to manage its 
finances through the winter season. The airline will repay it in two stages in March and November, rather than in full 
in March.
EasyJet in fresh plea for further state backing after £1.3bn loss Airlines
The loss brings down the curtain on a grim earnings season for Europe's largest airlines. A second wave of 
infections and new travel curbs have extinguished hopes of a swift recovery.
British Airways owner IAG reported a loss of (EURO)5.95bn in the first nine months of its financial year, while 
Ryanair suffered a loss of (EURO)197m over the traditionally highly profitable summer season. Mr Lundgren said 
positive vaccine test results offered "welcome news" and bookings had risen 50 per cent since the news broke. "I 
think there are reasons to be positive," he said, pointing to pent-up demand.
EasyJet shares have risen more than 40 per cent since Pfizer and Moderna announced successful test results, 
although they have still lost nearly half their value since the start of the year.
The airline, which had already warned that it was facing its first fullyear loss, reported a £1.27bn pre-tax loss for the 
year to September, including £438m of non-recurring costs such as ineffective fuel hedges and costs related to a 
broad restructuring. The carrier reported a profit of £430m in 2019.
With airlines largely in survival mode, analysts and investors are focused on how quickly companies are using up 
available cash.
EasyJet burnt through £651m in cash during the fourth quarter, down from £774m in the previous three months. 
Passenger numbers halved to 48.1m in the year to September and revenue fell 52 per cent to slightly more than 
£3bn.
The company has built up reserves of £3.1bn to last it through the crisis, including the Bank of England loan and 
selling off a chunk of its fleet that it has leased back.
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said: "EasyJet has amassed a pile of cash, but it may yet have to use it to reach 
the point of travel recovery. It has not yet demonstrated how or under what traffic scenarios its liquidity resources 
will be sufficient to see it through the crisis."
Mr Roeska said a new equity raise was the most likely path forward if the carrier needed more liquidity.
EasyJet stock dropped 1.9 per cent in London yesterday.

Nov 18, 2020( Alaska Dispatch: http://www.adn.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The first to fly will be American 
Airlines, which has scheduled a Max round-trip flight from Miami to New York's La Guardia airport for Dec. 29. 
According to an internal memo sent Sunday to Alaska Airlines pilots, the Seattle-based carrier plans to take its first 
737-9 Max delivery early next year and start flying it in service by the end of March. United Airlines expects to 
schedule flights on the Max in late January or February. 
Southwest Air, which has decided to take the time to put all of its 9,000 pilots through Max training before any of 
them fly passengers, said it likely won't put the Max on its schedule before April. Following the Federal Aviation 
Administration's lead, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with Transport Canada and 
Brazilian air safety regulator ANAC are also expected to clear the Max to fly by year end. That will pave the way for 
Ireland's Ryanair to start taking Max deliveries and for Air Canada and Calgary-based WestJet to begin flying the 
three dozen grounded Maxs already delivered into Canada. Before American flies passengers on the Max in late 
December, it has plans to try to reassure the public that the plane is safe. The airline will take employees and the 
press on demonstration flights out of Dallas. And it will invite corporate customers to tour the Max on the ground in 
Dallas, Miami and New York, where they can ask questions of pilots who will fly the plane. Southwest doesn't plan 
demo flights but said it will conduct 'readiness flights' on each aircraft before returning the Max fleet to scheduled 
service. And CEO Gary Kelly indicated he will likely fly on a Max before passengers do so. Though Boeing and 
some airlines have begun avoiding use of the now-tainted Max brand name, instead referring only to the 737-8 or 
737-9 models, all the U.S. carriers say they will make it transparent to travelers what plane they are flying on. All 
three U.S. airlines that were operating the Max before the grounding— American, United and Southwest — said 
they will rebook free of charge any passengers who balk at flying on a Max. American spokesperson Sarah Jantz 
said if a Max is switched onto a flight previously scheduled to be flown by some other plane, the airline will let 
passengers know via email, text and push notifications. 'If a customer doesn't want to fly on a 737 Max aircraft, they 
won't have to,' she said. 'We'll provide flexibility to ensure our customers can be easily re-accommodated if they 
prefer not to fly on one.' If a reluctant passenger doesn't want to re-book, the airlines will offer either refunds or 
vouchers for future travel depending on the type of ticket. Despite the downturn in demand, American, Southwest, 
United and Alaska are all keen to fly the Max so they can swap out older aircraft to eke out whatever savings they 
can from the jet's fuel efficiency advantage — the 737 Max burns 14% less fuel than the previous model 737 NG. 
When air traffic eventually recovers, airlines will also use the Max's longer range to open up new long-distance 
Related:Airlines offer reassurances about the 737 Max — and flexibility for travelers who don't want to board 
one
routes. For example, when United first started flying the Max, it flew the plane between Houston, Texas, and 
Anchorage, Alaska, a route too long for the 737 NG. 'The longer range and better fuel efficiency of the Max creates 
new options for flying a greater number of seats between more city pairs,' said a person familiar with United's plans. 
It's likely United will focus Max flights out of its hubs in Houston and Denver. Some international customers are also 
eager to get the Max. Low-cost carrier Ryanair is aggressively seeking to increase market share in Europe while 
rival airlines contract, and is negotiating a possible additional Max order in exchange for a large discount. Eddie 
Wilson, CEO of the main Dublin-based unit of Ryanair, speaking this month at a virtual webinar hosted by Australia-
based CAPA — Centre for Aviation, said the low-cost carrier wants to have up to 30 Maxs by next summer and has 
simulators and pilots ready for training. 'We've got to get this aircraft,' Wilson said. 'It's a fantastic aircraft. It's 
probably going to be the aircraft that has got the most scrutiny from safety regulators. And we are really looking 
forward to having it in our fleet.' The FAA's green light for the Max to return to service is the signal for a frantic 
period of aircraft modification and maintenance, as well as simultaneous intensive pilot training, before the plane 
can actually fly passengers. All of the U.S. airlines that will operate the Max will soon commence the new pilot 
training mandated by the FAA. That consists of approximately five hours' training in total: two hours of computer 
based training followed by a one-hour briefing to prepare for a two-hour session in a full-flight simulator handling the 
flight controls in various scenarios. Southwest has installed and certified nine 737 Max simulators to conduct the 
flight training with its 9,000 pilots. American and United will introduce Max flights on a rolling basis as teams of 
pilots come out of training. Boeing faces its own stiff challenge to get roughly 450 as-yet-undelivered Maxs out of 
mothballs and ready for customers. With many orders canceled, it must also find a new customer for more than 60 
of those jets. In addition, it will have to be deeply involved with the airlines that have the 385 Maxs that were in 
service before the jet was grounded. As foreign regulators follow the FAA in clearing the Max to fly, Boeing will set 
up airplane modification lines in various parts of the world to train the teams of mechanics that will do the work for 
each airline.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will take over 312 weekly slots at London Stansted airport from low-cost carrier rival 
easyJet (U2, London Luton) at the onset of the summer 2021 season, a slot-swap notice has shown. At the start of 
the current winter 2020/21 season, easyJet held 376 weekly slots at Stansted, including two held by easyJet 
Europe (EC, Vienna). The British LCC announced earlier this year that it would close its base at Stansted, although 
it said it would continue serving the airport from other bases. The swap confirms that easyJet will retain 58 weekly 
slots, while easyJet Europe will hold an additional pair, which it currently uses for services to Amsterdam Schiphol. 
In the slot swap request, Ryanair filed a placeholder schedule using the same destinations as previously operated 
by easyJet. As such, it has yet to confirm its expanded network out of Stansted. Ryanair is already the largest 
operator at Stansted, holding 2,312 weekly slots, over two-thirds of all. According to the ch-aviation capacities 
module, during the week starting on November 16, Ryanair will have an 86.8% market share at Stansted by 
capacity. easyJet used to be the second-largest operator at Stansted. Following the slot-swap, this title will now fall 
to Jet2 (LS, Leeds/Bradford). Following the closure of its Stansted base, easyJet will retain bases at London 
Gatwick and London Luton in the British capital (currently, it only flies from the former). Both of them are operated 
by easyJet UK (U2, London Luton).

Nov 17, 2020( 24/7 Wall St.: http://www.247wallst.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Aerospace &#38; Defense  Since 
March of 2019, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA[1]) has not delivered a single 737 Max commercial jet. Reports earlier this 
week have suggested the plane's U.S. grounding will be lifted soon, perhaps even as soon as Wednesday. 
So far neither Boeing nor the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has commented on when the plane will be 
recertified. In the meantime, the world continues to turn. Last week, the European Union began imposing a 15% 
tariff on new Boeing jets sold in EU countries. Because the 737 Max is also grounded in Europe, the tariff has no 
impact yet, but aerospace industry research firm Leeham News &#38; Analysis reports that there are more than 50 
737 Max aircraft scheduled for delivery[2] to EU member countries next year.Leeham data indicates that 30 of the 
planes are scheduled for delivery to Ryanair, with the remaining planes headed to the Czech Republic, Poland, 
Romania and Spain. Boeing is also scheduled to deliver five 787 Dreamliners to EU nations next year. All these 
planes are subject to the 15% tariff.Boeing also expects to deliver about half the 450 737 Maxes it has stored since 
last year's delivery halt. Leeham reports that Boeing is building just seven new 737 Max airplanes per month.The 
United States has been charging a 15% tariff on airplanes imported into the country since February. The dueling 
tariffs are the result of two long-running cases brought by Boeing and Airbus, each claiming the other had received 
illegal subsidies. The World Trade Organization agreed with both and allowed a tariff total of $7.5 billion of annual 
EU aircraft imports into the United States and $4 billion on U.S. exports to Europe.Neither tariff is likely to have 
much impact on deliveries from either Boeing or Airbus. Right now, few airlines are buying new planes because the 
COVID-19 pandemic has cut passenger traffic by as much as 70%. When those numbers turn around, the tariff will 
get buried in the financing and have a modest impact on the sale of new planes.What could give Boeing a bigger 
headache is a vote set for Tuesday in the U.S. House of Representatives that reforms the FAA's aircraft certification 
process. The bipartisan bill responds to shortcomings in the certification process that were implicated in the two 
fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in late 2018 and early 2019 that killed 346 passengers and crew.The Aircraft 
Certification Reform and Accountability Act[3] includes more than two dozen requirements to strengthen FAA 
certification oversight.For investors, however, the imminent return to the skies of the 737 Max is carrying the day. 
Boeing stock traded up about 2.5% in the noon hour Tuesday, at $207.61 in a 52-week range of $89.00 to $374.83. 
The Dow Jones industrials traded down about 0.4% at the same time. Get Our Free Investment Newsletter [ 1]:

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/easyjet-drops-to-1-3bn-loss-as-air-travel-collapses/Easyjet has plunged to losses of 
nearly 1.3 billion and conceded that even while it has cut services by 80 per cent going into the winter that flight 
plan is aimed at only reducing further expected losses.Despite the biggest loss in its 25-year history and a several 
months more yet of uncertainty, Johan Lundgren, the airline's chief executive, insisted: 'Easyjet has not only 
withstood the impact of the pandemic but now has an unparalleled foundation upon which to emerge strongly from 
the crisis.' With the short-haul, pan-European operator having already warned of the extent of its losses, Easyjet 
shares rose 2p to 779p. Prior to the pandemic outbreak, the shares were trading at above 15. Filings for the year to 
the end of September show Easyjet racked up losses from operations of 835 million before a further 438 million of 
one-off items took the total losses to 1.273 billion. 
In the airline industry's crucial spring and summer seasons which started with fleets grounded by the outbreak of 
Covid-19 and ended with the sector deeply troubled by incoherent travel and quarantine restrictions, Easyjet made 
underlying losses of 642 million. That is nearly four times the losses posted by its great rival Ryanair which reported 
losses of 172 million between April and September. The losses came after the pandemic halved Easyjet's 
passenger numbers in the 12 months to 48 million. With the fares it was able to charge passengers being cut by 
more than 10 per cent, revenues plunged by 53 per cent to 3 billion. Without the impact of the pandemic, Easyjet 
could have expected its 335-strong fleet of short-haul aircraft to carry about 100 million passengers. In the UK it has 
been the largest operator at three of the country's top five busiest airports — Gatwick, Manchester and Luton. It is 
33 per cent controlled by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its founder, who has spent much of the last decade since he left 
the board waging war against the company's directors. The airline's losses include 123 million covering the 
redundancies of 4,500 or 30 per cent of its workforce, working out at average pay-offs of about 27,000 apiece. 
There is a 311 million charge for future losses on the unwinding of its foreign exchange and jet fuel contracts and 
75 million of losses on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and the value of leased planes. Despite the months of 
uncertainty to come, the prospect of Covid-19 vaccines and more coherent testing programmes for air travel led Mr 
Lundgren to insist that the 3.1 billion of cash it has borrowed or raised will see it through the crisis. In a statement, 
the airline said: 'Based on current travel restrictions in the markets in which we operate, Easyjet expects to fly no 
more than circa 20 per cent of planned capacity for [the October-December] quarter. We remain focused on cash 
generative flying over the winter season in order to minimise losses during the first half [to the end of March]. 'We 
Easyjet drops to 1.3bn loss as air travel collapses
retain the flexibility to rapidly ramp up capacity when we see demand return. At this stage, given the continued level 
of short-term uncertainty, it would not be appropriate to provide any further financial guidance for the 2021 financial 
year.'

When news of a Covid vaccine breakthrough came last week, I did something I had not done for months. I went 
online to see how much it would cost to get from London to almost anywhere else.
I soon had the answer. EasyJet could fly me to the south of Spain for £173. British Airways would do it for £163 
from Heathrow, and Ryanair for £137 from Stansted.
So far, so normal. From holidays to haircuts, we take it for granted we can compare all sorts of options and prices at 
a click. Yet when it comes to the much grander sums we put towards retirement, or serious investments, the picture 
is depressingly different.
Take my latest pension fund statement. It says my money has gone to a blended multi asset fund here, a blended 
global equity fund there, and all are doing well against some not entirely obvious market benchmarks.
For someone like me, who would like to know how climate-friendly those investments are, and how their returns 
measure up against rivals, it's next to useless. If only one could compare such things as easily as, say, airline flights 
on Kayak or hotels on TripAdvisor.
From this week, that prospect has moved a step closer, thanks to a Swiss banker named Reto Ringger.
It's time we had a better way to judge where to put our money
You almost certainly have not heard of him, nor SAM, one of the world's first sustainable asset management firms, 
which he founded in Zurich in 1995. But you may have heard of the pioneering Dow Jones Sustainability Index, 
which he persuaded Dow Jones to launch with SAM in 1999.
Today Mr Ringger runs Globalance, a private bank that has just rolled out what he calls a "Google Earth for 
investors" - and anyone else who wants to see how green a company really is.
It's an online site called Globalance World that lets you compare the financial performance of thousands of 
companies, as well as their impact on society, the environment and other areas. Analysis of companies, but not 
entire portfolios, will be free of charge.
When I had a preview the other week, it showed Amazon had a pleasing double-digit financial performance for the 
year to date, but a slightly high climate warming potential.
Its warming score was still better than that of Apple's and Royal Dutch Shell. But all paled before Zoom, which had 
a reasonably low warming potential.
That puts the video conferencing business in a select club: Mr Ringger says only 5 per cent of the companies have 
a warming score below 2C.
He is braced for quibbles with the data and methodology he uses, some of which was developed by the MSCI ESG 
Research group. Some criticism may turn out to be justified. The lack of uniform official standards for measuring 
climate risk muddies these waters. But the transparency he is trying to achieve is laudable and overdue.
It is also in step with efforts EU regulators are making to steer money towards the greener ventures needed to meet 
their emissions-cutting goals. That requires more corporate transparency, says Richard Mattison, chief executive of 
S&P Global Trucost, an environmental data provider.
An ex-adviser on the EU's green finance strategy, he says that until now, companies have only had to disclose what 
they deem to be material, though they sometimes don't know what is material themselves.
He remembers a drinks company in Brazil that once told him water was not material for them because it cost so 
little - just 0.01 cents per cubic metre - that they constantly hosed down their lorries to keep the company logos 
shiny. But when a severe drought struck in 2014, the price jumped to $10 per cubic metre. "That made it 
unprofitable for them to do anything," he told me recently.
The transparency on Mr Ringger's Globalance World site may be bracing. It shows that Germany's Daimler car 
company, which was slower to embrace electric vehicles than some rivals, has a much higher warming score than 
BMW and Toyota.
Does he think they will be unhappy? "Yes, that's possible," he says. "But look, this is reality. That's what the best 
available models indicate and I think we should show it to investors."

I soon had the answer. EasyJet could fly me to the south of Spain for £173. British Airways would do it for £163 
from Heathrow, and Ryanair for £137 from Stansted.
So far, so normal. From holidays to haircuts, we take it for granted we can compare all sorts of options and prices at 
a click. Yet when it comes to the much grander sums we put towards retirement, or serious investments, the picture 
is depressingly different.
Take my latest pension fund statement. It says my money has gone to a blended multi asset fund here, a blended 
global equity fund there, and all are doing well against some not entirely obvious market benchmarks.
For someone like me, who would like to know how climate-friendly those investments are, and how their returns 
measure up against rivals, it's next to useless. If only one could compare such things as easily as, say, airline flights 
on Kayak or hotels on TripAdvisor.
From this week, that prospect has moved a step closer, thanks to a Swiss banker named Reto Ringger.
It's time we had a better way to judge where to put our money
You almost certainly have not heard of him, nor SAM, one of the world's first sustainable asset management firms, 
which he founded in Zurich in 1995. But you may have heard of the pioneering Dow Jones Sustainability Index, 
which he persuaded Dow Jones to launch with SAM in 1999.
Today Mr Ringger runs Globalance, a private bank that has just rolled out what he calls a "Google Earth for 
investors" - and anyone else who wants to see how green a company really is.
It's an online site called Globalance World that lets you compare the financial performance of thousands of 
companies, as well as their impact on society, the environment and other areas. Analysis of companies, but not 
entire portfolios, will be free of charge.
When I had a preview the other week, it showed Amazon had a pleasing double-digit financial performance for the 
year to date, but a slightly high climate warming potential.
Its warming score was still better than that of Apple's and Royal Dutch Shell. But all paled before Zoom, which had 
a reasonably low warming potential.
That puts the video conferencing business in a select club: Mr Ringger says only 5 per cent of the companies have 
a warming score below 2C.
He is braced for quibbles with the data and methodology he uses, some of which was developed by the MSCI ESG 
Research group. Some criticism may turn out to be justified. The lack of uniform official standards for measuring 
climate risk muddies these waters. But the transparency he is trying to achieve is laudable and overdue.
It is also in step with efforts EU regulators are making to steer money towards the greener ventures needed to meet 
their emissions-cutting goals. That requires more corporate transparency, says Richard Mattison, chief executive of 
S&P Global Trucost, an environmental data provider.
An ex-adviser on the EU's green finance strategy, he says that until now, companies have only had to disclose what 
they deem to be material, though they sometimes don't know what is material themselves.
He remembers a drinks company in Brazil that once told him water was not material for them because it cost so 
little - just 0.01 cents per cubic metre - that they constantly hosed down their lorries to keep the company logos 
shiny. But when a severe drought struck in 2014, the price jumped to $10 per cubic metre. "That made it 
unprofitable for them to do anything," he told me recently.
The transparency on Mr Ringger's Globalance World site may be bracing. It shows that Germany's Daimler car 
company, which was slower to embrace electric vehicles than some rivals, has a much higher warming score than 
BMW and Toyota.
Does he think they will be unhappy? "Yes, that's possible," he says. "But look, this is reality. That's what the best 
available models indicate and I think we should show it to investors."

expects 
air passenger numbers to bounce back to near normal levels by next summer, defying industry predictions that it 
could take years for growth to return after the pandemic.The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said 
passenger volumes should reach 75-80% of pre-Covid levels in 2021, especially if a vaccine was developed by the 
spring. While he admitted winter was a 'write-off', he claimed Ryanair was poised 'at the dawn of an extraordinary 
era of growth' with a fleet of new planes arriving, and was emerging from the pandemic with a strong balance sheet, 
in a position to offer low fares to stimulate travel. 
Speaking at the World Travel Market conference, O'Leary said he was optimistic that Covid vaccines would be 
rolled out before the peak summer season in 2021. 'There's going to be an enormous snapback on travel demand 
Mrs O'Leary is very keen to go back to the Algarve and I suspect she'd be there in 2.5 nanoseconds after the 
coronavirus restrictions are lifted. I think she's reflective of the overwhelming majority of Europe's population, and 
they will go back,' O'Leary said. 'We're going to see a surge of that intra-European tourism next year, and we need 
to be there to provide the capacity at low prices.' Ryanair has cut capacity for winter, but not yet as drastically as its 
rival easyJet. O'Leary added: 'I've heard a lot of rubbish coming from legacy airlines that it'll be 2035 till the volumes 
come back. Rubbish. Volumes will go back in 2021 or 2022 pretty quickly - they will go back because Ryanair will 
discount prices, hotels will discount.' The travel industry organisation Abta said some firms had reported bookings 
for next summer since the announcement of a vaccine by Pfizer on Monday, while more were receiving inquiries 
from would-be holidaymakers. TravelSupermarket said 54% more people had searched for holidays in the 24 hours 
since the vaccine news, compared with the previous Monday. On the Beach, which organises about 1.5m package 
holidays a year, said online traffic had jumped 25% but there had not yet been a notable impact on bookings. An 
Abta spokeswoman said the vaccine news would 'go some way to restoring consumer confidence' but the industry 
needed government support now 'as many travel companies will not be able to wait for the full rollout of a vaccine'. 
O'Leary criticised government 'incompetence', particularly in the UK but across Europe, in addressing the 
pandemic. He said: 'What was disturbing is the way the government mishandled that first lockdown it should have 
given time to put in place mass testing.' He said Boris Johnson's promise of a world-class test-and-trace system 
had been 'utter vacuous rubbish', and questioned the approach now being taken by the UK government's global 
taskforce in developing a new testing regime for arrivals. 'Airport testing is a complete waste of time it's too late, it 
Ryanair expects air passenger numbers to bounce back in 2021
takes too long, what do you do in a terminal when you have positive tests?' Ryanair supported pre-departure 
testing, O'Leary said, to restart flying. 'Testing should not be at airports, people should be coming to airports with a 
negative test Certainly within Europe, short-haul should be restarting quickly.' O'Leary said he had been busy 
negotiating new airport slots around Europe for after the pandemic. 'Airports are realising that a lot of Lufthansa's 
capacity is not coming back they want to deal with an airline that is rapid and flexible. What we've done is been 
keeping all our planes, pilots and crew current, so we can pounce on growth.' Ryanair's fleet should be augmented 
by the first deliveries of Boeing 737 Max planes, O'Leary said, anticipating European regulatory approval of the 
model in January. He dismissed concerns over the safety of the plane, which was grounded after two fatal crashes. 
'It will be the most audited, the most interrogated, safest aircraft ever to fly.' Read more: Ryanair expects air

have 
upgraded Britain's growth forecasts amid hopes that Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine will end the health restrictions that 
have hammered businesses and the economy this year.GDP may return to pre-pandemic levels as soon as the 
middle of next year as life gets back to normal faster than many forecasters had dared predict. Those that produced 
a range of scenarios said that their 'upside' projections now appeared more likely. 
Capital Economics said that unemployment was likely to peak 'at 7 per cent next year instead of 9 per cent' and that 
GDP may 'rise to its pre-virus level a year earlier than otherwise . . . early in 2022 rather than 2023'. Douglas 
McWilliams, chairman of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said that GDP growth next year 'might 
be double-digit or close to that' and may have recovered all the lost ground since March possibly 'as early as mid-
2021'. Simon French, UK economist at Panmure Gordon, said: 'This would bring forward the period for return to 
pre-Covid levels of output to the first half of 2022, from the first half of 2023.' Even economists who decided not to 
change their forecasts said that the vaccine presented 'upside risks' to their projections. Oxford Economics is 
forecasting growth of 5.4 per cent next year in its 'baseline' scenario, but 8.9 per cent in its 'upside' one. Andrew 
Goodwin, UK economist at the consultancy, said that the vaccine 'changes the skew of the risk profile, placing a 
higher probability on our upside scenario'. Last week the Bank of England downgraded its 2020 forecast from a 
contraction of 9.5 per cent to a contraction of 11 per cent and for the recovery next year to be slower, with growth of 
7.25 per cent rather than 9 per cent. It expected the lost ground since March to have been recovered by early 2022. 
The Bank did not base its models on a vaccine being discovered and few economists imputed a growth path based 
on a miracle drug. George Buckley, UK economist at Nomura, said: 'It's certainly very encouraging news so could 
present upside risks to our view. The vaccine means there's now a greater chance of a 'step adjustment'.' A vaccine 
raises the possibility of life returning to normal[1], encouraging people back into the shops and on to aircraft. 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the low-cost airline, said that it was the 'first bit of sunshine we've had 
for the past 12 months'. He forecast a return to 75 per cent to 80 per cent of pre-crisis traffic by next summer, an 
improvement on the 50 per cent to 80 per cent range he had given eight days earlier. 'There's reasonable optimism 
now that summer 2021 will get back to some degree of normality,' he told an online conference a day after Pfizer 
said that its experimental vaccine was 90 per cent effective in trials. Read more: Economy will have recovered from

Iberia (IB, Madrid Barajas) will relocate its services from Madrid Barajas to Milan from Milan Malpensa to Milan 
Linate as of December 1, 2020, the carrier's internet booking engine shows. The Spanish airline currently operates 
daily from the Spanish capital to Malpensa using A319-100s and A320-200s. Following the move to Linate, the 
frequency of flights will increase to 12x weekly (2x daily on weekdays and one flight each on Saturdays and 
Sundays). The relocation further consolidates Linate's position as the airport of choice for full-service European 
carriers. According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Malpensa, located much further away from the city centre, 
is mainly served by low-cost carriers. The three largest carriers, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), Wizz Air (W6, Budapest), 
and easyJet (U2, London Luton), have a 58.1% market share at the airport by capacity. Alitalia (AZ, Rome 
Fiumicino) recently abandoned its former northern Italian hub altogether in favour of Linate which sees no LCC 
traffic at all. There, Alitalia has an 86.8% market share. Iberia will join Alitalia and Linate's six other full-service and 
hybrid carriers (excluding scheduled business charter operator GlobeAir (GAC, Linz)).

Nov 10, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate Release 
Chicago, IL - November 10, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day 
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[1], United Airlines Holdings, Inc. 
UAL[2], American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[3], Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[4] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[5]. 
Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Coronavirus Ruins Airlines' Q3 Earnings, As Well Airline stocks 
have been in the pink of health over the past few years, mainly on the back of solid passenger revenues owing to 
robust air-travel demand. However, with the advent of coronavirus in the first quarter of 2020, things deteriorated for 
the entire aviation space as travel demand plummeted with people being confined to their homes in the fear of the 
contagion.What is worse is that the health peril is still very much around even though more than seven months have 
elapsed since the disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Consequently, airlines 
continue to bear the brunt of this global adversity. As an evidence, airlines fared dismally for the third successive 
quarter this year with losses mounting due to crippled passenger revenues.Against this bleak backdrop, let's 
recapitulate the results of a few key airline stocks for the September quarter.Delta Air Lineskicked off the third-
quarter 2020 earnings season for the aviation industry on Oct 13. This Atlanta-GA based company incurred a loss 
(excluding $5.17 from non-recurring items) of $3.30 per share in the September quarter, wider than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.14. Also, passenger revenues plunged 83% year over year in the September 
quarter. In fact, due to low demand, this key metric declined 68% in the first nine months of 2020.Akin to Delta, 
Chicago-basedUnited Airlinessuffered a loss in the third successive quarter of 2020. The carrier reported a loss 
(excluding $1.83 from non-recurring items) of $8.16 per share in the September quarter, comparing unfavorably 
with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $7.63. Passenger revenues plunged 84.3% and 68.4% in the third 
quarter and during the first nine months of 2020, respectively.American Airlinesposted a loss (excluding 83 cents 
from non-recurring items) of $5.54 per share for third-quarter 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
a loss of $5.62. Passenger revenues plunged 76.9% and 64.2% in the third quarter and during the first nine months 
of 2020, respectively.Dallas-based low-cost carrierSouthwest Airlinesfared no better and announced a loss for the 
third consecutive quarter like its fellow airline players mentioned above. The carrier, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Delta Air Lines , United Airlines , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines and 
Ryanair Holdings
(Hold) currently, incurred a loss of $1.99 per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) in the reported 
quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.44. Moreover, passenger revenues plunged 
71.2% and 61.2% in the third quarter and during the first nine months of 2020, respectively.You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[6] Any Respite Ahead? With airlines having 
performed disappointingly in the third quarter, echoing the first two quarters' trend, the million-dollar question is 
whether things will look up for the stocks from hereon. Unfortunately, the answer is a big no at least for the near 
term. Notably, Delta's president Glen Hauenstein warned that 'it may be two years or more' for the revenue stream 
to normalize.Even though air-travel demand showed signs of marginal recovery, particularly, on the leisure front, 
the spike in the coronavirus cases all across Europe (resulting in renewed lockdowns in many countries) and the 
same in some parts of the United States induce fears that the surge in cases might offset the improvement in travel 
frequency. Notably, European carrierRyanair Holdingsforecasts losses to worsen in the second half of fiscal 2021 
(ending Mar 31, 2021) from the first.Additionally, the expiry of the CARES Act on Sep 30 forced carriers like 
American Airlines and United Airlines to shrink their respective workforces in the face of dwindling air-travel 
demand. Despite some positive developments, a second round of financial aid from the government has not 
materialized yet, thereby making the job cuts necessary.However, on a brighter note we expect focus to shift to a 
second round of federal stimulus once Biden is officially declared as the next US president. The positive vibes on 
the package, which came from various quarters prior to the elections, might see a further impetus leading to the 
much-anticipated sop eventually seeing the light of the day.In the event of a further federal stimulus, the bruised 
and the battered U.S. airline stocks would surely get some relief as the pandemic grant will protect jobs in the near 
term and keep hopes afloat amid the existing unprecedented crisis. Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit

Lastminute boss hits at carriers over refunds Travel& leisure Corradino says some airlines have not acted over

Lastminute boss hits at carriers over refunds; Travel& leisure Corradino 
says some airlines have not acted over cancelled flights

Marco Corradino, chief executive of www.lastminute.com, has renewed his attack on the airlines for withholding 
refunds for cancelled flights during the coronavirus crisis.
The travel agent boss told the Financial Times the way the airlines had acted was "totally illegal", adding that 
regulators had failed to address the problem because the carriers were in effect too big to fail. "It's like the banks in 
2008. If you don't save the airlines, the whole industry will suffer," said the head of one of Europe's leading online 
travel agencies.
Mr Corradino, who urged airlines to issue refunds faster in June, said many were still not paying up or delaying for 
months, despite legal obligations to reimburse within seven days of a cancellation. This forces agents to refund 
passengers from their own resources. The consumer watchdog Which? estimates more than £1bn worth of refunds 
for holidays were still owed to customers in the UK, with about 9.4m people having had package holidays cancelled. 
But airlines insist they have paid billions of pounds in claims, despite an unprecedented backlog and an industry-
wide cash crunch following a collapse in passenger numbers.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, called online travel websites "overcharging scam artists" as they added 
commission to the face value of the carrier's flights.
Lastminute boss hits at carriers over refunds Travel& leisure Corradino says some airlines have not acted over

The low-cost airline said it had not paid back hundreds of thousands of customers who booked using websites such 
as www.lastminute.com and On the Beach because it does not have their personal details including card numbers, 
which are typically processed by the agents.
The company also said that in some cases it had paid out refunds to travel agents that had not been passed back 
to the customers. "We refuse to pay back online travel agents who then sit on the money, use it for cash flow and 
don't refund passengers," said Dara Brady, Ryanair's director of marketing and digital, suggesting that customers 
directly contact the airline to request a refund.
Ryanair has processed (EURO)1.5bn of refunds and vouchers and says it has repaid everyone it has the correct 
details for. British Airways has processed 2.5m refund requests and issued 1.8m vouchers, and Virgin Atlantic has 
repaid £500m to customers.
But the Association of British Travel Agents said that some travel agents had been forced to take out loans or 
reimburse travellers out of their own pocket.
"The whole Covid pandemic exposed a monumental flaw in the system," said Craig Ashford, marketing director of 
travel agency TravelUp, who is spearheading a lobbying effort to force airlines to hold customer money in a trust 
account until a flight takes place.
"We were up in the region of 55,000 bookings that were cancelled overnight and we don't have that level of money 
to refund all those customers," he said.
Expedia, the online travel agent, said airlines determine the timing of refunds as they hold the customers' money. 
Thomas Cook, relaunched as an online travel agent in September, said it had only chosen to work with airlines that 
were "being flexible" with bookings.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) said Monday that it lost its appeal to reverse the UK's decision to enforce a 14-day mandatory 
quarantine for crew members that flew to and from Denmark, which led to cancellation of flights.
The airline, the stock for which was up 15% at midday in London, said in a tweet that the "idiotic" quarantine 
restrictions are without merit and scientific basis. 
Britain's Transport Minister Grant Shapps said the short-notice decision cannot be changed, Ryanair added. 
Shapps on early Saturday said non-UK citizens are banned from entering Britain in light of the reported outbreaks 
of coronavirus in Danish mink farms.

Nov 09, 2020( Boy Genius Report: http://bgr.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The UK government announced that it 
has banned travel from Denmark after the Danish government revealed it found a potentially dangerous coronavirus 
mutation[1]. Denmark said earlier this week that it will slaughter 17 million minks from its fur farms after discovering 
that the coronavirus had mutated inside the animals and infected at least 12 people. Some scientists say the 
mutation has pandemic potential[2], while others call for calm because too little is known about the mutated 
coronavirus strain.The Danish government announced earlier this week plans to cull up to 17 million minks[3] from 
its fur farms and isolate one region of the country. Researchers discovered that the novel coronavirus had infected 
the animals and suffered a dangerous mutation that might render the current generation of vaccines useless. 
Some of the scientists involved with the matter warned that the mutation is a serious cause of concern and might 
lead to another pandemic. Others called for calm, saying it's too early for panic[4] because more research is 
required. Danish scientists have started sharing genomic sequences of the new coronavirus mutation, and 
international researchers will soon study the new strain. The UK government has taken the risk very seriously and 
decided to ban Denmark visitors from entering Great Britain. The decision will be reevaluated as the situation 
progresses. The UK transport secretary announced the decision shortly after 02:00 GMT, less than two hours 
before they took effect, according to BBC News[5]. UK citizens returning from Denmark will have to isolate along 
with all family members for 14 days. The move also applies to cabin crew flying back and forth between the two 
countries. The only exception applies to freight and haulers. Ryanair, one of the biggest low-cost airlines in the 
region, criticized the decision by calling it 'bizarre and baseless.' The airline still has to comply, so it canceled all 
flights to and from Denmark.DENMARK update: From 4am on 7 November, British Nationals or residents who are 
returning to the UK directly or indirectly from Denmark will need to self-isolate with other members of their 
household until two weeks have passed since they were last in Denmark. — Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP 
(@grantshapps) November 7, 2020[6] 'This decision to act quickly follows on from health authorities in Denmark 
reporting widespread outbreaks of coronavirus in mink farms,' transport secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter. 
'Keeping the UK public safe remains our top priority.' The travel ban will be reviewed after a week, according to the 
Department for Transport (DfT). Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod said the ban was a 'very drastic 
step.' He added that the Danish authorities were working closely with international health organizations on the 
matter. UK officials will seek out anyone who traveled to Denmark in the last couple of weeks and advise them to

self-isolate. Authorities in Denmark said a few days ago[7] that some 12 people are known to have been infected 
with the mutated coronavirus. But the BBC now says that 200 people have been infected with strains related to 
mink. The mutations impact the virus's spike protein, which is the coronavirus component that allows the virus to 
latch onto healthy cells. Most vaccines target the spike protein to block this specific process. Denmark has 
announced that a lockdown will be introduced in some areas because of the mutation. Most of the infections are 
connected to farms in Denmark's North Jutland region. Of note, the World Health Organization said it's too early to 
jump to conclusions.  Chris Smith started writing about gadgets as a hobby, and before he knew it he was sharing 
his views on tech stuff with readers around the world. Whenever he's not writing about gadgets he miserably fails to 
stay away from them, although he desperately tries. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. [ 1]: https://bgr.com

View original post here[2]. Biden in, COVID out.  Global stocks and S&#38;P futures exploded higher, hitting all time 
highs, following this morning's news that a Pfizer covid vaccine [3]is more than 90% effective, which came at a time 
when stocks were already euphoric in the overnight session following the weekend's political news that Biden was 
in.  The result, in a nutshell, was an explosion in small caps, a surge in the Dow, a spike in the S&#38;P and a 
slump in the Nasdaq (more below).    "This is about the best the news could possibly be for the world and for 
theUnited Statesand for public health," said William Gruber, Pfizer senior vice president for vaccine clinical research 
and development. It was better than even the best result he had hoped for, he said. 
 The news, which conveniently came just days after Biden was declared president elect by the media, sent Emini 
S&#38;P futures up as much as 4%, last seen up 124 points to 3,634 or up 3.8%    and hitting new all time highs, 
surpassing the early September closing record of 3,568.    pushing European stocks up 3.9%, led by travel, banks, 
energy and auto sectors    and Dow futures up 5%, or more than 1,400 points, to 29,650    the ETF of Russell 2000 
ETF small-caps, the RTY, just hit the 7% limit up.    With the Pfizer news unleashing an epic reflation trade, the 
Nasdaq initially rose but then tumbled on the back of the sharply higher yields which are hitting deflation names 
such as the FAAMGs    triggering an impressive reversal in the S&#38;P/Nasdaq relationship:    "For stocks, this is 
likely the best of both worlds," saidJoyce Chang, head of global research at JPMorgan Securities. "A GOP senate 
majority should ensure that Trump's pro-business policies stay intact. Under Biden, additional tariffs that fueled the 
trade war are unlikely to materialize."  Stocks that had struggled due to lock-down/restrictive measures related to 
the virus soared; cruise operators, airlines, hotels, amusement park/movie theater operators and casinos were 
among the early session's top 'lock- down' performers.  Airline stocks surged, with the Stoxx 600 Travel &#38; 
Leisure Index up as much as 7%, the most intraday since May 26, with the index reaching the highest since Match 
9; British Airways parent IAG jumped 25%, cruise operator Carnival surged 18%, Ryanair gained 18% and hotel 
company Accor jumps 12%. U.S. airlines also jumped premarket, with American Airlines up 15% and Delta up 12%.  
Catering companies like Sodexo and Compass, travel booking software firm Amadeus also surging, as are airports 
concession operators like WH Smith, SSP Group and Autogrill. Aerospace stocks are also surging, with Airbus, 
Safran and Rolls-Royce among the biggest gainers in the industrial goods index, along with airports operators like 
ADP and Aena.  Bank stocks also jumped in premarket trading: BofA, Citigroup and JPMorgan climbed about 7% 
S&P Futures, Global Stocks Soar To All Time High, Russell Limit Up On Covid Vaccine News
while Wells Fargo jumped more than 8%; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs rose more than 5% as the yield 
curve sharply steepened. Regional banks rallied, too with KeyCorp, Huntington, Regions and Truist rising more 
than 5%.  Banks had been hard hit this year by pandemic-induced economic woes and low interest rates; the KBW 
Bank Index (BKX) has tumbled 31% versus an 8.6% gain for the S&#38;P 500. Card stocks gained as well, with 
Visa and Mastercard adding more than 5%, and American Express and Capital One up more than 8%.  At the same 
time, stay at home stocks such as Peloton, Netflix and Zoom sank: PTON is down 5.2%, NFLX -3.3% and ZM -5%; 
Nautilus, Etsy and Wayfair also fell. The news also hammered companies that had boomed amid an insatiable need 
for Covid-19 tests: QDEL sank 14% as QGEN tumbled 12%; among smaller companies trading on lighter volumer 
were GNMK -6.1%, FLDM -2.8%.  Looking ahead, Bloomberg notes that there's precedence for the market's gains 
to continue. Since 2000, every time the S&#38;P 500 was higher heading into Election Day, November and 
December came in green, too. The first years of presidential terms have also been good ones of late. Since 1986, 
according to Leuthold Group data, they've seen average gains of 18.6%.  The news also helped crude oil explode 
8% higher    while such flight to safety trades as Treasury yields, reversed amid expectations the reflation trade may 
finally be unleashed should covid be vanquished, and the 10Y yield soared as much as 14bps higher, rising to a 
session high of 0.9338% before easing back to 0.91%. Supply is also a factor as this week's Treasury refunding 
begins with 3-year note sale at 1pm ET and a heavy IG corporate issuance slate is expected.    Others safety 
trades such as gold and silver, were also hammered, tumbling over 2%.    In FX, the USD was little changed 
overall, though the underlying bias was negative according to BMO's Stephen Gallo; in BBDXY terms the currency 
is down 2.4% in Q4 to-date. Within the FX space, the bulk of the weakness in the USD was shouldered by the 
currencies of commodity exporters (NZD, AUD, NOK, CAD, IDR and MXN). Risk assets fed off the strength in 
commodity prices and weaker USD (Hang Seng +1.2%, Stoxx-50 +6.0%), and the rally gained momentum after 
reports of an effective vaccine circulated.  Elsewhere in FX, the TRY rallied 6.1% vs the USD after leadership 
changes were announced for Turkey's MoF and central bank over the weekend. The majority of FX investors 
probably expect CBRT to tighten its monetary policy stance further to rein in credit growth, although that is clearly at 
odds with Erdogan's ideological preference for rate cuts. Despite that sentiment, the yield on the local currency 2-
year government debt dropped (probably because financial markets had already been applying the tightening for 
the central bank). The next scheduled rate decision is on November 19.  Looking ahead, here are some of the 
week's key events:  Brexit trade-deal talks between the U.K. and EU continue in London Monday  Tuesday is the 
EU's target date for triggering tariffs on as much as $4 billion of U.S. goods in retaliation over illegal aid to Boeing 
Co.  Alibaba holds its annual Singles' Day on Wednesday, an online global shopping phenomenon that had $38 
billion of sales last year  ECB President Christine Lagarde, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey and Fed Chair Jerome 
Powell are among the speakers Thursday at an online ECB Forum entitled 'Central Banks in a Shifting World'  
Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 hold an extraordinary meeting Friday to discuss bolder 
action to help poor nations struggling to repay their debts.  Aside for the Pfizer covid vaccine, here are some of the 
other top overnight news from Bloomberg:  Biden is largely ignoring Trump's efforts to undermine his victory. The 
president-elect plans to unveil on Monday his transition team's coronavirus task force, a step toward fulfilling his 
central campaign promise: He will make containing the pandemic his first priority  Republican congressional leaders 
still wary of crossing President Donald Trump are holding back from acknowledging Democrat Joe Biden's victory in 
the 2020 presidential race  Joe Biden won the presidency promising to bring Americans together. But now his 
administration is sure to come under pressure from some Democrats to risk exacerbating divisions by investigating 
and prosecuting Donald Trump  Germany is seeking to mend transatlantic trade relations and is mulling a more 
conciliatory approach that would see the European Union delay tariffs set to hit $4 billion of American products as 
soon as Tuesday, according to a senior official familiar with the government's thinking  Unlike Donald Trump, whom 
Chinese officials had little knowledge of before he took office, Joe Biden is well known in Beijing. But that history is 
unlikely to quickly repair a relationship between the global powers that has fundamentally changed over the past 
four years  France's economy will take a smaller hit from the new lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 than it 
did during the tighter restrictions on activity earlier this year, according to the country's central bank  Over the 
course of the next seven days, the U.K. premier needs to deliver a trade deal with the EU or risk a chaotic and 
economically damaging rupture, and avoid a rift with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden over the U.K.'s controversial 
Brexit laws  While it's already somewhat dated, here is DB's Jim Reid with a recap of the weekend's firehose of 
news:  So barring an extraordinary series of events Joe Biden will be the next President of the US. Not that it 
matters in the great scheme of things but we've been debating whether this was a close election or not. It really 
depends on how you look at it. In terms of the popular vote, Joe Biden won more votes than any candidate in

history and will likely win by the second most decisive result since 2000. He leads by 3pp currently with this likely to 
grow in the coming days, with Nate Silver predicting 4.3pp over the weekend. However in the end the election could 
have been tied at 269 (and a Congress likely to be weighted towards anointing Trump) without a combined c.55,000 
votes in Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia. It's largely irrelevant but interesting nevertheless.  Attention will still 
remain on the remaining Senate races. The Democrats have gained a net of one seat so far, and it looks likely that 
a pair of run-off elections in Georgia on January 5th will determine which party controls the Senate over the next 
two years. The most likely outcome though is a divided government as the Dems would need to win both against 
current expectations.  The market last week stuck to the normal script post a close election where the market rallies 
regardless of who wins rather than one where micro analysis of post election policies are used to predict what 
happens next. Who needs us analysts?  The S&#38;P 500 rallied +7.32% last week (-0.03% Friday), while the VIX 
fell -13.2pts to 24.9, its lowest level since August. It was the S&#38;P's best week since early April when the index 
was coming back from the pandemic lows. Indeed it was the best post election 2-day performance since 1900 
according to DB's Binky Chadha.  Binky also noted that going into the election, near term implied vol across asset 
classes had risen sharply and vol curves were steeply inverted. As the election unfolded in a largely orderly fashion, 
vol collapsed, with vol curves now significantly flatter across the board. The drop in implied vol has been entirely 
driven by a fall in risk premiums, with realised vol in fact rising. The equity vol premium is now in the middle of its 
historical range, according to Binky suggesting the unwinding of protection positions is done.  However, the bounce 
in the S&#38;P 500 took it only to the top of the range it has been in since August so you could argue we've just 
returned back to where we were before election risk premiums started rising. Technology and Biotech stocks 
outperformed last week with the NASDAQ up a greater +9.01% (+0.04% Friday). The positive risk sentiment was 
seen in Europe as well, as the Stoxx 600 ended the week +7.02% higher (-0.20% Friday) while the FTSE MIB 
(+9.69%), CAC 40 (+7.98%), and DAX (+7.99%) all gained sharply.  In terms of the economic outlook post election 
our US economists updated their view on Friday. Since Election Day, Senate Majority Leader McConnell has 
sounded more open to a stimulus deal. This shift in tone increases the chances for a lame duck package and could 
hint at the potential for a somewhat larger stimulus deal than they originally thought without a 'Blue Wave'. So they 
keep their current baseline assumption of a roughly $750bn fiscal package legislated by Q1 even though they 
previously worried about this in a split government scenario.  Although the pace of the economic recovery entering 
Q4 has exceeded their prior expectations, worsening covid trends continue to be a source of downside risk in the 
coming months. Balancing out these risks, they have upgraded their Q4 real GDP growth projection by 120bps to 
2.3% (annualised). This is mainly due to a 170bps upward revision to consumer spending, which we now see 
expanding by 1.6% in the current quarter. The upshot is that 2020 growth has been revised up by 30bps to -2.9% 
on a Q4/Q4 basis. They have not made any material changes to their 2021 and 2022 growth projections. However, 
given the importance of the Senate outcome, they plan to reassess their view pending the results of those elections 
in early January. See their note here for more.  Asian markets have started the week on a front foot with the Nikkei 
(+2.41%), Hang Seng ( +1.77%), Shanghai Comp (+1.95% ) and Kospi ( +1.41%) all advancing. Futures on the 
S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq are also up as much as +1.70% and +2.60% respectively on the news of a Biden 
Presidency. In FX, the onshore Chinese yuan is up +0.54% to 6.5771. The Turkish lira is also up +1.56% this 
morning after a new central bank chief was appointed over the weekend and the subsequent resignation of the 
country's finance and treasury minister, Berat Albayrak. Elsewhere, crude oil prices are up c. +2.50% while spot 
gold prices are up +0.70%. In terms of weekend data releases, we saw China's October exports at 11.4% yoy (vs. 
9.2% yoy expected), the highest growth since March 2019 while, imports stood at +4.7% yoy (vs. +8.6% yoy 
expected).  Onto the latest on the virus and the US reported another 102,342 cases over the past 24 hours, 
marking the 5th continuous day over 100k. The state of Utah is now facing an overcrowding of hospitals and has 
declared a state of emergency and ordered a mask mandate. The state has also ordered 2-week restrictions on 
casual social gatherings and extracurricular activities. Meanwhile in Oklahoma, more than 90% of ICU beds are 
now occupied and the state's health commissioner has asked residents to wear masks and observe other 
precautions. President Elect Joe Biden will speak later today on his plan to 'beat Covid 19,' under which he is 
expected to appoint a 12-member coronavirus task force. In Europe, Italy reported over 30k for the 5th consecutive 
day yesterday. For more on how the virus is spreading see the table below.  Maybe as US election noise begins to 
fade we'll return back to the virus and to what promises to be a crucial week for Brexit trade negotiations although 
one can be accused of crying wolf so many times before on this sort of statement that markets won't really pay it 
too much attention. However to ratify any deal across Europe before December 31st, mid-November has often 
been cited as the last point where a deal can be struck. Deadlines have been extended before but the next week 
S&P Futures, Global Stocks Soar To All Time High, Russell Limit Up On Covid Vaccine News
takes us to that point. A call between PM Johnson and the EU's Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday suggested 
progress had been made but that there were still issues around the level playing field and fishing. The PM noting 
'significant differences' remain and von der Leyen suggesting 'large differences'. Talks will continue this week.  On 
the data front, this week is a quieter one, with the highlights including the US CPI reading for October on Thursday, 
along with the preliminary consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan for November. The UK will 
also be releasing its Q3 GDP reading, although for Q4 the Bank of England is now predicting another contraction 
with England now experiencing a second lockdown.  Finally, earnings season is winding down now, with 438 of the 
S&#38;P 500 companies having now reported. We will only see a further 16 S&#38;P 500 companies report this 
week, along with a further 65 from the STOXX 600. In terms of the highlights, today we'll hear from McDonald's, 
before tomorrow sees reports from Adidas and Deutsche Post. Then on Wednesday we'll hear from Air Products 
and Continental, before Thursday sees reports from Walt Disney, Cisco Systems, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, 
Merck, Applied Materials, Tencent and Nissan Motor.  Though the main central bank decisions are now out of the 
way, there'll be a number of speakers over the week ahead, particularly given an ECB forum on central banking this 
week. The expected highlight will be a policy panel on Thursday featuring ECB President Lagarde, Federal Reserve 
Chair Powell and Bank of England Governor Bailey, so that'll definitely be one to keep an eye on, not least given 
the potential for further stimulus as coronavirus cases continue to rise on both sides of the Atlantic.  Looking back at 
more of last week now, with the Senate looking likely to remain with the Republicans at this point, markets viewed a 
divided government as bullish for Treasuries. US 10yr Treasury yields fell -5.5bps (+5.6bps Friday) to finish the 
week at 0.819%. In Europe core sovereign debt went the other way and the risk on dominated rather than the micro 
of US fiscal policy as 10yr Gilt yields rose +1.2bps (+4.0bps Friday) to 0.27%, while 10yr Bund yields were up 
+0.6bps (+1.6bps Friday) to -0.62%. Peripheral sovereign debt spreads to bunds tightened as risk sentiment rose. 
Italian (-12.5bps), Spanish (-4.4bps), Portuguese (-3.1bps) and Greek (-14.0bps) 10yr bond yields all tightened to 
bunds. Credit spreads in the US and Europe also tightened on the week, particularly high yield debt. US HY cash 
spreads were -56bps tighter, while Europe HY cash spreads tightened -40bps. IG US cash spreads were -9bps 
tighter and -3bps in Europe.  The US dollar also reacted to the election news as the greenback fell -1.92% (-0.32% 
Friday) on the week, the largest one week fall since late March and is now at its lowest level since late August. This 
drop in the dollar supported commodity prices as WTI (+3.77%) and Brent crude (+5.31%) rose sharply. Metals also 
gained with a +3.49% rise in copper prices and gold gaining +3.86%, its best week in just over three months. 
Bitcoin was interestingly up +14.03% (+2.03% Friday)  In terms of data released on Friday, US payrolls were the big 
highlight. The US labour market unexpectedly strengthened last month, having added +638k jobs (vs 580k 
expected) which dropped the unemployment rate to 6.9% (vs 7.6% expected). Underneath the headline numbers 
there were some worrying trends, as the number of long-term unemployed (jobless for 27 weeks or more) increased 
by 1.15 million to 3.56 million, the highest level since early 2014. In Europe, German industrial production came in 
under expectations at +1.6% (vs. +2.5 expected), though this was an improvement from last month's revised +0.5% 
gain. Italian retail sales for September fell less than expected at -0.8% (vs -1.5% expected), but this was a sharp 
reduction from last month's +8.2%. [ 1]: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/l9uPbStQ3YU/sp-

Nose for growth Bullish Wizz holds fast to expansion plan

Wizz Air is sticking to its expansion plans as it positions itself for a recovery in passenger numbers next year.
Jozsef Varadi, head of the Londonlisted carrier, said that while he was preparing for a "difficult" winter dominated by 
travel curbs, he expected demand to return by April.
He said: "Coming out of winter and going into spring, we will start seeing some improvements. We will see demand 
coming up quickly."
The Hungarian carrier has announced plans to open 13 bases including at Gatwick and Doncaster Sheffield since 
April, betting that it can exploit the crisis to raise its footprint across Europe while rivals retrench.
Shares in Wizz climbed 2 per cent yesterday. They have lost 8 per cent this year, outperforming rivals such as 
easyJet and British Airways owner International Airlines Group.
Wizz has had to slash its flight plans for the winter like its competitors, and sank to a (EURO)237m loss before tax 
for the six months to September 30. The company made (EURO)385m in profit for the same period last year.
Analysts expect Wizz to fly between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of its planned schedule through the winter, against 
40 per cent for Ryanair and 25 per cent for easyJet. Philip Georgiadis and George Steer

Shares in food ordering group Delivery Hero hit an all-time high yesterday as renewed lockdown measures across 
much of Europe pushed up demand and Citigroup raised its price target for the company.
Food ordering app Just Eat also climbed. The company's share price has risen by a quarter in the year so far on 
strong demand from consumers stuck at home.
Commerzbank slid after the German lender said it had sharply increased its provisions for loan losses in 
preparation for insolvencies from small- and mediumsized businesses.
Its share price has fallen by more than a quarter this year.
Dutch bank ING also slipped after it said the effects of the pandemic meant it would be forced to cut 1,000 jobs 
worldwide.
"We will concentrate even more on core clients and simplify our geographical footprint, which will require fewer 
staff," said chief executive Steven van Rijswijk.
German carrier Lufthansa fell after the company swung to a (EURO)2bn loss in the third quarter and warned that 
the fourth quarter would be difficult as European travel ground to a halt.
Ryanair also slid after passenger numbers in the first half of the year sank. Camilla Hodgson

POINTSRyanair airlines got involved in the U.S. presidential fervor Wednesday with a tweet chiding Donald Trump 
for declaring early victoryThey also took a jab at Kanye West, whose presidential run hasn't had much of an 
impactBefore the election, Ryanair's Twitter account joined in with liberals making fun of Donald Trump Jr. for a 
humorous election map that for some reason showed Liberia, the Black Sea and Antarctica as Democratic districts 
A new challenger has waded into the debate around the 2020 presidential election: Ryanair. 
TheTwitter account for the Ireland-based airline took aim at both Kanye West and Donald Trump's attempt to 
declare victory before all the votes hadbeen counted. Budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe have 
spotless safety records. Photo: Michal Osmenda/Creative Commons Trump has maintained that he is on track to 
win the presidency despitevotes still being counted in counties where Joe Biden is favored. Trumpdeclared a 'BIG 
WIN' around 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday, and began a steady stream of accusations alleging misconduct around 
polling places. Ryanair saw an opportunity to raise itspublic profile while taking a jab at the president.It also took 
aim at West, whose long-shot presidential campaign and warm relationshipwith Trump has been the subject of 
ridicule. West has failed[1] to have much of an impact on the presidential election, appearing on the ballot in only 12 
states after a series of legal challenges and procedural blunders. He managed to place 4th in many states but didn't 
garner over 0.4%.West remained positive on Twitter, focusing just on the personal victory of voting for himself.This 
isn't the first time Ryanair has gotten involved in U.S. politics. Ryanair touched on an unusual electoralmap that was 
tweeted out by Donald Trump Jr.The map was mocked by Twitter users because itincluded Antarctica. [ 1]:

suffered a loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Sep 30, 2020).Coronavirus-led low travel demand also 
caused a 63.1% year-over-year plunge in the regional carrier SkyWest's SKYW[3] third-quarter 2020 earnings. 
Further, tepid passenger revenues induced losses for the likes of American Airlines AAL[4], JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[5] and Southwest Airlines LUV[6] in the September quarter as mentioned in theprevious week's write-up[7]. 
Synopsis of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Gol Linhas incurred a loss (excluding 89 cents from non-recurring 
items) of 91 cents per share in the third quarter of 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 80 
cents. Net operating revenues of $181.4 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $188 million. 
Moreover, the top line declined significantly year over year with passenger revenues plummeting 74.9% on a year-
over-year basis due to suppressed air-travel demand amid coronavirus concerns. For the fourth quarter, Gol Linhas 
anticipates capacity to double in the third quarter.2. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) currently, incurred a 
loss (excluding $1.08 from non-recurring items) of 12 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, narrower 
than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents. Quarterly revenues of $1,228.4 million also surpassed 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,174.1 million but plunged more than 60% year over year due to the 62% 
decline in traffic. Ryanair expects its traffic to be approximately 38 million in fiscal 2021[8].You can seethe complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[9]3. SkyWest's third-quarter 2020 earnings per share of 66 
cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. However, earnings declined 63.1% year over year due 
to coronavirus-induced low air-travel demand. Moreover, quarterly revenues of $457.5 million tanked 39.8% year 
over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $426.8 million. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a 
significant cut in the number of scheduled flights resulting in the year-over-year downside[10].4. In an expansion 
update, Southwest Airlines announced that it will operate flights to five destinations from Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport starting Feb 14, 2021. The destinations are Nashville (four times a day), Baltimore/Washington 
(four times daily), Denver (six times a day), Dallas (Love Field: four flights daily) and Phoenix (twice a day). On Mar 
11, 2021, the carrier will start serving its fourth destination in Colorado. The new location is Colorado Springs.

IAG International Airlines Group is still interested in acquiring Air Europa (UX, Palma de Mallorca) but is waiting for 
clarification on the terms of Spanish state aid to the carrier, Group Chief Executive Luis Gallego said during a 
quarterly earnings call. "We believe that the strategic rationale remains strong. And that's why we are in discussions 
with Air Europa. 
We know that they are working with the Spanish government to receive a package to support the company. We are 
waiting to see the package and the conditions attached. And at that moment, we will continue the negotiations to 
see if the conditions that we can close in this new situation," he said. He added that IAG continues to see the deal 
as a positive development for the Europe-Latin American market. The Spanish Ministry of Finance formally 
authorised a EUR475 million euro (USD555 million) loan to Air Europa on November 3, 2020. The aid will consist of 
two separate loans, one of EUR240 million (USD280 million) and the other of EUR235 million (USD275 million). 
The aid will be granted under the framework of the COVID-related Solvency Support Fund of Strategic Companies 
(Fondo de Apoyo a la Solvencia de Empresas Estratégicas), which is financed by state-owned industrial holding 
SEPI. Ryanair suggested earlier it would seek to legally block any state assistance to Air Europa. IAG initially 
agreed to acquire Air Europa, via its subsidiary Iberia (IB, Madrid Barajas), for EUR1 billion (USD1.15 billion) back 
in late 2019. In July, the bid was reportedly cut to EUR500 million (USD580 million). IAG itself posted a EUR1.3 
billion (USD1.5 billion) operating loss for the third quarter of 2020. Having operated a quarter of its normal capacity 
between July and September 2020, it was planning to cap operations at less than 30% of last year's capacity in the 
final quarter of 2020. Despite the losses, IAG said it still had EUR9.3 billion (USD10.8 billion) liquidity, roughly on 
par with the level posted in March 2020.

Nov 04, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The European low-
cost airline Ryanair said in a tweet[1] Wednesday that President Donald Trump's premature claim to have won the 
2020 election was "like disembarking before the plane has landed." "We don't recommend," it added. Ryanair's 
tweet came moments after Trump claimed that he had won the 2020 US presidential election in a speech at the 
White House — despite votes in key states still being counted. 
"We were getting ready to win this election," Trump said. "Frankly, we did win this election." Visit Business Insider's 
homepage for more stories[2].Ryanair, one of the world's biggest airlines, has compared President Donald Trump's 
premature claim to have won the 2020 election[3] to leaving a plane before it has landed.In the early hours of 
Wednesday, Trump told a White House press conference[4] that "frankly, we did win this election[5]." Votes were 
still being counted in key states.Hours later, the budget airline tweeted[6]: "Trump declaring victory this early is like 
disembarking before the plane has landed — we don't recommend." —Ryanair (@Ryanair) November 4, 2020[7] In 
his speech, Trump said also claimed vote-counting was a "major fraud on our nation," without offering 
evidence.Ireland -based Ryanair wasn't the only company to respond to Trump's claims: Both Facebook and Twitter 
immediately clamped down on social media posts from Trump, but in very different ways[8].Read more: Trump and

flights during the coronavirus pandemic[10].In May, the European low-cost airline said in a statement[11] it would 
cut around 3,000 jobs — 15% of its workforce.It also said it planned pay cuts of up to 20%, would offer unpaid leave 
to some employees, and would shut its bases across Europe until travel demand picks up. CEO Michael O'Leary

Global cases top 47 million  Global 7-day average hits highest level yet  Argentina to import new vaccine  Bulgaria 
reports record deaths  * * *  Update (1515ET): Just as more people (including the CEO of Ryanair during an 
interview yesterday on CNBC) argue that lockdowns should be substituted for mass-testing regimes relying on the 
new fast-turnaround antigen tests, the FDA has issued a new alert to clinical laboratories implying that these faster 
tests aren't reliable by warning that false positives "can occur".    On Twitter, commentators pointed out that this 
feature was already well known, and that mass-testing would make up for it. The announcement was prompted by 
reports of false tests in nursing homes, according to Reuters. The warning comes after the administration signed 
deals with companies to supply these new tests - which are growing in popularity as more countries look to thwart 
fast-growing epidemics with faster testing turnaround.  As Reuters[3] explains, Antigen tests detect proteins on the 
surface of the virus. 
They require an uncomfortable nasal or throat swab, and can produce results more quickly than molecular tests - 
which detect genetic material in the virus - but are considered less accurate.  * * * Update (1434ET): It's mid-
afternoon in the US, and with the world holding its breath awaiting the outcome of Tuesday's vote, news headlines 
have been unsurprisingly light on COVID-19 news.  The biggest news from the US and Europe on Tuesday starts in 
the US, where NJ, the state with the highest rate of spread, has seen hospitalizations climb, with 1,133 as of Nov. 
2. That number has more than doubled in the span of a month. Daily cases have also doubled, to 1,832 on 
Tuesday, from 957 on Oct. 2.  #COVID19[4] UPDATE: NJ has 1,832 new positive cases for a cumulative total of 
242,825. We're reporting 18 new confirmed deaths for a total of 14,582 deaths. This #ElectionDay[5], we're still in

midst 
of 
a

pic.twitter.com/y2jeRDKdNU[7] — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) November 3, 2020[8]  NYC, meanwhile, 
saw its 7-day average continue to rise, reaching 605 as of Nov. 1.  "We're watching that very carefully," de Blasio 
said during a Tuesday news briefing. "Some of that again is because of a lot more testing, but it's still cause for 
concern."  Greece recorded 2,166 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, a new record, as the government 
placed Thessaloniki, the country's second city, under lockdown.  In Italy, health officials registered another 28,244 
new cases, the biggest jump yet, along with 353 new deaths.  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced plans to

extend the country's partial lockdown until mid-December and impose additional restrictions as the number of 
COVID-19-related hospitalizations continues to rise.  * * *  While more than 100 million people have already voted in 
Tuesday's US election, cases and hospitalizations have climbed in several swing states, including Wisconsin and 
Iowa, among others, in recent weeks, while deaths have edged higher, but not nearly enough to validate the 
increasingly ominous warnings from Dr. Anthony Fauci.    The most notable trend over the past couple of weeks in 
the west has been the acceleration of the coronavirus across Europe, leading to a wave of new lockdowns and 
restrictions, as both positivity rates and fatality rates among the biggest European countries have surpassed the 
US.    Source: JPM  Now that the final JHU numbers are in, it looks like the world saw 439,621 new cases on 
Monday, with roughly 84,000 of those coming from the US.  Even though the global number didn't top 500k again 
on Monday, thanks to the US and Europe, the seven-day moving average of global coronavirus cases has 
exceeded 500,000 cases for the first time ever, just as total cases are reaching 46.8 million. Europe and the US 
have seen case surges in recent weeks, with American battleground states in the South and the Midwest 
particularly hard hit.  Across the US, most states are seeing case numbers rise, though there are some notable 
exceptions, including California, which has seen its 7-day average decline by 2% WoW, while case numbers soar 
across the northeast and midwest.    Source: mSightly[9]  Here's some more COVID-19 news from overnight and 
Tuesday morning:  Spain and France reported new records on Monday with the former reporting 55k new cases 
and the latter 52k (Source: JHU).  South Korea's core consumer price index for October declined 0.3% year-on-
year, marking the sharpest fall since September 1999, as the pandemic dampened domestic demand and a 
temporary government subsidy on mobile phone bills weighed on prices (Source: Nikkei).  Argentina will import 10 
million doses of Russia's experimental COVID-19 vaccine between December and January, as infections continue 
to climb in the South American country (Source: Nikkei).  A gauge of the rate of increase in coronavirus infections in 
Germany has fallen in recent days, though it's too early to conclude that there has been a turning point, according 
to the RKI public health institute.  The curve looks to be flattening somewhat at the moment, but this has to be 
treated with a great deal of caution as a few days cannot provide concrete evidence of a change in the trend,' RKI 
Vice President Lars Schaade said at a news conference in Berlin. The institute's virus reproduction factor, which 
last week climbed to as high as 1.45, was at 1.07 on Monday. A reading above 1 represents exponential growth 
(Source: Newswires).  Bulgaria also reported a record number of Covid-19 deaths. New cases in the Balkan country 
doubled last week. Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, himself recovering from the virus at home, said the government 
isn't 
planning 
a 
lockdown

Never mind getting planes into the sky, some airline executives must wonder how to stay standing.
Given its strong balance sheet, Ryanair captain Michael O'Leary will worry less than most. His airline has the 
financial strength to last through the latest upswing of Covid-19 cases. A new lockdown in England will not help - 
the UK is the source of a fifth of Ryanair's business. Yet its share price rallied yesterday even after a rare second-
quarter loss.
A loss during this typically cash flow rich period is rare. For Ryanair, it is the first since 2008. But, post-tax, red ink 
was in fact less than half analyst expectations at minus (EURO)22.6m. Average monthly cash burn in the first half 
ran at about (EURO)193m. Meanwhile, cash control and timely financing, via the equity and bond markets, meant 
the airline finished the first half of the year to September with (EURO)4.5bn in pure cash. Yes, net debt is up but 
reserves more than cover the (EURO)1.5bn in debt due next year - and perhaps a year of cash burn.
Not that Mr O'Leary offered forecasts other than passenger numbers. The company claimed that the airline would 
serve 38m passengers this fiscal year. That would mean carrying 21m passengers in the second half, almost a 
quarter up on the first half. Given there are more EU travel restrictions now than at any time during the pandemic, 
this is questionable.
Mr O'Leary is not the only executive shy on financial forecasting. Even in early November, it is hard to find a major 
regional travel group willing to provide an outlook to the end of 2020, notes Jarrod Castle at UBS.
Forget about high-flying valuations, staying financially grounded matters most. Ryanair aims to hold on to staff,

Never mind getting planes into the sky, some airline executives must wonder how to stay standing.
Given its strong balance sheet, Ryanair captain Michael O'Leary will worry less than most. His airline has the 
financial strength to last through the latest upswing of Covid-19 cases. A new lockdown in England will not help - 
the UK is the source of a fifth of Ryanair's business. Yet its share price rallied yesterday even after a rare second-
quarter loss.
A loss during this typically cash flow rich period is rare. For Ryanair, it is the first since 2008. But, post-tax, red ink 
was in fact less than half analyst expectations at minus (EURO)22.6m. Average monthly cash burn in the first half 
ran at about (EURO)193m. Meanwhile, cash control and timely financing, via the equity and bond markets, meant 
the airline finished the first half of the year to September with (EURO)4.5bn in pure cash. Yes, net debt is up but 
reserves more than cover the (EURO)1.5bn in debt due next year - and perhaps a year of cash burn.
Not that Mr O'Leary offered forecasts other than passenger numbers. The company claimed that the airline would 
serve 38m passengers this fiscal year. That would mean carrying 21m passengers in the second half, almost a 
quarter up on the first half. Given there are more EU travel restrictions now than at any time during the pandemic, 
this is questionable.
Mr O'Leary is not the only executive shy on financial forecasting. Even in early November, it is hard to find a major 
regional travel group willing to provide an outlook to the end of 2020, notes Jarrod Castle at UBS.
Forget about high-flying valuations, staying financially grounded matters most. Ryanair aims to hold on to staff, 
admittedly on reduced pay. It has the wherewithal to last out this crisis. And it can afford to invest. It still wants its

Highlight: Low-cost carrier Ryanair chief executive Michael Oâ(EURO)(TM)Leary has said that the company 
expects to operate 50% to up to 80% of 2019 levels mid-next year.
Body
Reuters quoted O'Leary as saying: "We don't expect at this stage that we will return to a full 2019 schedule. "We 
have different plans that would vary anything from 50% of 2019 up to 80% of 2019." The expectation was revealed 
in a pre-recorded video presentation after presenting Ryanair's six-month financial results. 
The carrier saw its revenue drop by 78% to (EURO)1.18bn with traffic decreasing by 80% to (EURO)17.1m during 
the first half of this fiscal. Since mid-March, the carrier grounded the group's entire fleet until the end of June as the 
European (EU) Governments imposed flight or travel bans and widespread population lockdowns. Additionally, it 
entered an agreement with its employees and unions regarding pay cuts to minimise job losses. The company said 
in a statement: "FY21 will continue to be a hugely challenging year for Ryanair. "Given the current Covid-19 
uncertainty, Ryanair cannot provide FY21 PAT guidance at this time. "The group expects to carry approximately 38 
million passengers in FY21, although this guidance could be further revised downwards if EU governments continue 
to mismanage air travel and impose more uncoordinated travel restrictions or lockdowns this winter. "The group 
expects to record higher losses in H2 than in H1." In September, Ryanair issued an (EURO)850m Eurobond at a 
fixed 2.875% for five years. The carrier raised gross proceeds of nearly (EURO)400m through a non-pre-emptive 
placing of new ordinary shares the same month.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, hit at Boris Johnson's "mismanagement" of the virus crisis yesterday as 
the airline recorded losses over the summer months.
The Irish carrier's boss warned of a winter of deepening losses as governments roll out travel curbs.
The airline posted a net loss of (EURO)197m for the six months to the end of September, excluding exceptional 
items, after passenger numbers fell 80 per cent to just over 17m.
Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, which owns Stansted and East Midlands airports, 
also criticised the government over the lockdown.
The European summer is normally highly profitable for Ryanair, which recorded a profit of (EURO)1.15bn in the 
corresponding period in 2019.
The European airline sector has been savaged. IAG suffered an operating loss of (EURO)5.95bn in the first nine 
months of the year, while easyJet has lost more than £800m in 2020.
Ryanair expects to record higher losses in the second half of its financial year, which began on October 1, following 
travel curbs.
Ryanair expects deepening winter losses Airlines
Mr O'Leary said on the BBC that the UK's lockdown in the spring "achieved nothing". He expected the second to 
achieve "even less". He said: "It is just a cover up for political mismanagement, which the Johnson government 
continues to deliver."
Ryanair had no plans to cancel any UK flights despite the restrictions banning leisure travel, which meant 
customers would not receive refunds if they chose not to fly, Mr O'Leary said.
Mr Cornish said: "We are reacting to news that leaves many in our industry facing a very bleak future." He found out 
about the restrictions on social media; the government had given the industry no warning.
Mr O'Leary was more relaxed, as November was the airline's quietest month and lossmaking, even in normal times. 
"If there was a very good month to have a lockdown for the airline industry, it would be November," he said.
Ryanair stock closed up 3.8 per cent in London yesterday.

 Ryanair (RYAAY), the largest European budget airline, said on Monday it swung to a loss in the fiscal first half 
following an 80% plunge in passenger traffic, reflecting the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the aviation 
industry.
The Dublin, Ireland-based carrier reported a loss after tax of 197 million euros ($229 million) during the six months 
that ended Sept. 30 versus 1.15 billion euros of profit a year ago, according to a statement. The loss was incurred 
despite a 67% drop in operating costs to 1.35 billion euros.
The company grounded its entire fleet from mid-March to the end of June as countries in the European Union tried 
to control the spread of the respiratory illness. Revenue plummeted to 1.18 billion euros from 5.39 billion euros a 
year ago as passenger traffic plunged to 17.1 million. Earlier in the year, consultations were underway at Ryanair 
for base closures, pay cuts of up to 20%, and as many as 3,000 job losses at the airline.
"The group has agreed modest pay cuts with our people and their unions which helped minimize job losses," the 
company said. "Route development teams are working with airports across Europe," which suffered steep traffic 
declines, Ryanair said. "Discussions are ongoing with aircraft suppliers to amend pricing to reflect the new COVID-
19 reality."
Ryanair said fiscal 2021 would "hugely challenging" and sees higher losses in the second half than in the first as 
the number of passengers flown was set to drop to 38 million, a figure that is subject to revision as Europe is back 
in the grips of coronavirus yet again and near full national lockdowns were announced in France and the UK.
The carrier, which has received reimbursements from Boeing (BA) for the delay of more than 18 months in 
delivering 737 Max 200, said compensation discussions will be concluded after they companies agree on a revised 
delivery schedules. The Irish carrier expects the new aircraft would help spur growth in annual passengers to 200 
million over the next five to six years.
Ryanair Swings to Loss in Fiscal First Half as Coronavirus Pandemic Results in 80% Plunge in Passenger 
Traffic
Ryanair also warned of "adverse trading consequences" following the UK's exit from the EU at the end of this year, 
saying the risk of no deal remains "high." Ryanair said measures have been taken to ensure it remains majority 
owned in the EU, including restricting voting rights of non-EU shareholders, in the event of a so-called hard Brexit.

POINTSEurope's Ryanair, Alaska Air are offering 2-for-1 deals on seatsAirlines are dropping prices to stimulate 
demand and break-evenTickets prices around peak travel season have been very low To pull up the spiraling travel 
demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines across the world are now trying to entice flyers by offering 
attractive discounts like 'buy one get one free'deals.Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, is offering[1] for the first time 
ever 2-for-1 special flights through mid-December.AirAsia, mainly operating out of Southeast Asia, sold as many as 
200,000 'unlimited passes[2],'which allowed customers in some markets to travel as much as they wished for a 
limited time period. This scheme has exceeded expectations of the airlines, as some customers used the pass as 
many as 20 times.Alaska Air Group offered customers[3] a three-seat row for the price of one through sales in the 
past three months.Alaska Air has been launching three promotional offers a month when it usually runs only 10 to 
12 promotions a year. During the third quarter, the airline said ticket prices dropped by 17%. 'We are able to 
stimulate demand in a way we weren't sure we'd be able to,' Natalie Bowman, managing director of marketing and 
advertising at Alaska Air, told The Wall Street Journal[4].Such deals are helping airlines operate at least some of 
their flights, while most of their planes remain parked. 
The carriers want to drop prices enough to stimulate demand, so they can break even.Airlines are slashing prices 
around peak travel times like never before,Scott Keyes of price tracker Scott's Cheap Flightsis quoted as saying in 
the WSJ. Round trips by full-service carriers over Christmas from New York City to Nashville may be as less as $71 
this year, down from $300, he added. The holiday season has brought with it some hope of demand in the U.S., 
while in Europe, new lockdowns threaten the aviation industry again.The devastation of the aviation industry during 
the coronavirus pandemic has prompted airlines to walk newer paths like turning their planes into restaurants. 
Singapore Airlines[5] did the same with its A380 superjumbo jets for two days in October. It had to add another day 
for the first lunch batch sold out quickly.Similarly, Taiwan's EVA Air made its flights into 'aviation camps' wherein 
customers got guided tours of operations, simulated experiences of flying a plane, putting out a fire in a mock cabin, 
etc. The price range for these experiences was between $100 and $350. While Americans have tentatively 
resumed flying for leisure travel, business trips collapsed by as much as 90 percent during the pandemic Photo:

Ryanair posts first summer loss in decades
Ryanair posts first summer loss in decades

Ireland's Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday posted a loss for its key summer period for the first time in decades, 
and warned that the COVID-19 crisis could force further cuts and leave capacity next summer as little as half of 
normal levels.
Europe's largest low-cost airline said COVID-19 restrictions had pushed passenger numbers down 80% in the six 
months ended Sept. 30, when it typically makes most of its annual profit.
Instead, it posted a loss of 197 million euros for the first half of its financial year, from a profit of 1.15 billion in the 
year-ago period. A company poll of analysts had on average forecast a loss of 244 million euros.
The airline, whose Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in September described the upcoming winter as a "write-off", 
declined to forecast profit for the full financial year ending March 31, but said it expected a second-half loss greater 
than the first.
Ryanair reaffirmed plans to fly 38 million passengers this financial year compared with the 149 million last year, but 
warned that the number could fall further "if EU governments continue to mismanage air travel and impose more 
uncoordinated travel restrictions".
Air traffic across Europe could be as much as 75% lower than normal this winter, O'Leary said in a pre-recorded 
presentation.
Ryanair is planning to fly between 50% and 80% of its normal capacity next summer, depending on how the 
pandemic develops, he said.
Ryanair posts first summer loss in decades
Ryanair, which has one of the airline industry's strongest balance sheets, said it had cash on hand of 4.5 billion 
euros at September-end and aircraft worth about 7 billion euros.
It said its cash balance was supported by a 250 million euro supplier reimbursement from Boeing in the July-
September quarter.
The airline has only posted one annual loss in the past 30 years, in 2009. It still made a small profit in the summer 
of that year.
Ryanair said it had yet to finalise terms with Boeing Co on compensation for the 18-month delay of deliveries of the 
grounded 737 MAX jet. It said it hoped to receive at least 30 MAX jets in time for its peak summer season next 
year.
Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan told Reuters that Ryanair was also talking with Airbus, but added that talks with 
Boeing were "more advanced."
Citi analyst Mark Manduca said in a note that the results for the first half were slightly better than expected, 
however, the recent imposition of COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe was likely to be the key driver for Ryanair and the 
EU aviation sector in the near term. (Reuters)

Nov 02, 2020( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  A series of U.K. companies 
across the airline, retail and hospitality sectors warned of a hit to profits on Monday, as they raced to count the cost 
of the nation's latest COVID-19 lockdown, which comes into force this Thursday.Under the new restrictions[1], 
restaurants, pubs, entertainment venues and nonessential shops in England will have to close until Dec. 2, although 
cabinet office minister Michael Gove has said the restrictions could extend [2]beyond that date. Read: England 
faces new lockdown as U.K. virus cases pass 1 million [3] Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended[4] the government 
furlough program for the length of the lockdown, making grants of up to 3,000 a month for companies forced to

will be a 'devastating blow'[5] to business communities who have done everything in their power to adapt and

across the U.K. over the past eight months, with little end in sight,' Marshall said. Read: How the Great British pub 
is reeling under new COVID-19 rules [6] 'Many firms are in a much weaker position now than at the start of the 
pandemic, making it far more challenging to survive extended closures or demand restrictions,' he added. His 
comments came as Ryanair RYAAY, +2.95%[7] said on Monday that it faced a 'hugely challenging' winter as 
governments across Europe imposed travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Associated British Foods 
ABF, +1.44%[8], the owner of clothing retailer Primark, said it estimated it would lose 375 million[9] ($484 million) of 
sales from temporary closures of its stores in major markets because of COVID-19 restrictions. Helen Dickinson, 
chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said retail faces 'a nightmare before Christmas'[10] as the 
government proposes to close thousands of retail premisesunder this new national lockdown, denying customers 
access to many of their favorite shops and brands.  'It will cause untold damage to the high street in the run up to 
Christmas, cost countless jobs, and permanently set back the recovery of the wider economy, with only a minimal 
effect on the transmission of the virus,' Dickinson said. Meanwhile, GVC Holdings GVC, -3.43%[11], the owner of 
the Ladbrokes Coral betting group, warned on Monday of a 43 million hit[12] to the profit of its gambling stores.  
However, shares in Ocado OCDO, +8.04%[13] leapt 6% on Monday, as it upgraded earnings forecasts[14] and 
investors saw greater demand for its online groceries amid the new lockdown measures. Gear4Music G4M,

musical instruments to keep them busy. 'Drilling down into the U.K. equities space, it is clear to see that investors 
are sifting through the market looking for lockdown winners and dumping lockdown losers,' said Russ Mould, 
investment director at AJ Bell. 'Supermarkets are going to be in demand once again, withchatter that big queues 
already started to form over the weekend. Sales couldimprove for this sector over the coming month, but costs are 
also likely to behigher as companies likely reintroduce measures to help keep customers safe andcrowds under 
control,' he added. Ryanair RYA, +3.84%[16] reported a pretax loss of €197 million ($253 million) for the first six 
months to the end of September, compared with an €1.15 billion profit for the same period last year. Passenger 
numbers plunged by 80% to 17 million, compared with 85.7 million in 2019. Shares in Ryanair were trading 2.92% 
higher on Monday morning. Shares in International Airlines Group IAG, -0.02%[17], owner of British Airways, fell 
1%, while easyJet EZJ, +0.11%[18] were 0.59% lower. Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets U.K., 
said that even without the weekend news of another U.K.-wide tightening of restrictions, the outlook for the travel 
sector was already looking increasingly bleak. 'While politicians have held out the hope of a relaxation of restrictions 
at the beginning of December, the reality is that we could well go beyond that, and it would appear the softening up 
for just such an outcome is already beginning,' Hewson said. Read: Heathrow boss hopeful of London-New York air

kept its forecast to carry 38 million passengers this financial year, but said this guidance could be revised down if 
European governments continue to 'mismanage air travel [21]and impose more uncoordinated travel restrictions or 
lockdowns this winter.' Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said 
Ryanair's descent into loss showed just how dramatically the COVID crisis has reversed the fortunes of airlines. 
'The company does see a glint of hope through the stormy clouds for next summer, expecting a sharp lift in 
passenger numbers, but that could still be wishful thinking. Some combination of a vaccine[22] and track-and-trace 
testing could prevent a third wave next year, but if this is just the start of a trend of rising infections and repeat 
restrictions, the company will struggle to climb out of the crisis,' Streeter said. Read: Heathrow offers rapid one-hour

from €5.3 billion last year. The airline said that its cost base was reduced by 67% in the first half to €1.35 billion, 
and that it expects to receive its first Boeing BA, +2.24%[24] 737-Max-200 aircraft early in 2021, with 30 in 
operation before peak summer season in 2021. As of the end of September 2020, Ryanair said it had €4.5 billion

the many growth opportunities that will be available in all markets across Europe,' the airline said in a 
statement.The post : Ryanair faces 'hugely challenging' winter as companies count the cost of lost business under

 Ryanair (RYA.L) reported a loss in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 as the COVID-19 pandemic pushed operating 
revenue down 78% on the back of an 80% crash in customer traffic. 
Interim loss attributable to equity holders of the airline's parent was 214 million euros ($249.1 million), including 
exceptional items worth 214 million euros, according to a Monday filing. 
Revenue in the six months declined to 1.18 billion euros from 5.39 billion euros, with customer traffic standing at 
85.7 million from 17.1 million. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it continues to expect roughly 38 million passengers in the full fiscal year, but may be 
lower if the European Union governments "continue to mismanage air travel" with further lockdowns. Without 
providing an exact profit guidance, the company said it expects higher losses in the second half than the first half.

Ryanair RYA.I is in talks with Boeing BA.N about possible new aircraft orders, but the focus is on the 197-seat MAX 
200 rather than the larger MAX 10, which will not be available for a couple of years, Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said on Monday.
"Boeing are not in a position to engage in discussions on the MAX 10 at the moment," O'Leary told a conference 
call. "They have pushed back production of the MAX 10 by anything up to two years ... so they are not really at a 
point where they can give us any deliveries ... or discuss pricing."
O'Leary said Boeing had agreed that Ryanair would be first in the queue when production slots for the 230-seat 
MAX 10 become available.

Budget airline Ryanair has posted a 226-million-euro (263-million-dollar) net loss for the second quarter of the 
financial year as the coronavirus pandemic continued to weigh on passenger numbers.
The announcement on Monday marks a sharp contrast to the same July-to-September period the previous year, 
when Ryanair record a profit of 910 million euros.
Ryanair's chief exectuve Michael O'Leary said that overall losses for the first half of the financial year - 411 million 
euros - were less red ink than the airline expects for the second half of the financial year.
O'Leary added that though the company currently expects passenger volume to reach 38 million during the entire 
financial year, it was impossible to give a prognosis considering the measures that are being imposed by national 
governments to contain the second wave of the pandemic.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-will-not-provide-refunds-for-november-flights/Ryanair customers will 
not be refunded for flights in November, according to its boss, despite the UK government banning all but essential 
travel.Michael O'Leary said if a flight was operating, passengers would not get their money back but they could 
change to a later flight without paying a fee. 
From Thursday, all but essential travel will be banned under a second lockdown[1]. Ryanair said the first lockdown 
and subsequent restrictions resulted in an 80% drop in passenger numbers[2]. It said 17.1 million people travelled 
on the airline in the six months to September, compared with 85.7 million last year. The carrier reported a €196.5m 
(174m) loss for the period compared with a €1.15bn profit last year. But it warned the situation was likely to worsen, 
saying it 'will continue to be a hugely challenging year for Ryanair'. The new lockdown measures for England to 
stop the spread of the coronavirus were announced on Saturday and are expected to come into force on 5 
November following a vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday. They will remain in place until at least 2 
December though Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said restrictions could extend beyond that date[3]. 
Commenting on what it means for people who have booked flights, Mr O'Leary told the BBC's Today programme: 'If 
a flight is operating then no, we will not be offering refunds. 'But what customers can avail of is our change facility 
and we've waived the change fee so if they have booking in November they can change it and move it to December 
or January if needs be. But there won't be refunds on flights that are operating and travelling.' Revenues in the six 
months to September plunged to €1.1bn from €5.3bn last year. During the period, air travel ground to a virtual halt 
as countries introduced measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. However, when flights did resume Ryanair 
said passenger confidence and forward bookings 'were negatively impacted by the return of uncoordinated EU 
government flight restrictions in September and October which heavily curtailed travel to and from much of Central 
Europe, the UK, Ireland, Austria, Belgium and Portugal'. Read more: Ryanair will not provide refunds for November

Ryanair may consider Ex-Im financing in "~crisis' scenario
Ryanair may consider Ex-Im financing in "~crisis' scenario
AirFinance Journal

Ryanair foresees using equity or bond financing to finance its future Boeing 737 Max orders but does not rule out 
using the Export Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im) as a "backstop".
Speaking on an analyst call, Ryanair Group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said the carrier would likely use 
a mix of equity and "low-cost" bond financing to fund future orders.
But in a "crisis eventuality" Ryanair could also tap US Ex-Im support.
O'Leary ruled out sale and leaseback transactions to fund orders, describing those airlines that did so as securing 
"distressed prices" and leasing back the aircraft at what are "very disadvantageous financing costs in the current 
climate".
Ryanair by contrast continues to have a fleet which is approximately 80% unencumbered, he added.
O'Leary also disclosed that the Irish carrier was in discussions with Boeing over additional orders, including for 737 
Max 10 aircraft.
He said discussions were currently focused on the 737 Max 200, of which Ryanair currently has 135 firm orders and 
75 options, as the US manufacturer was not in a position to engage on more detailed discussions regarding the 
Max 10.
"Boeing are not in a position to engage in discussions about the Max 10 at the moment. They have pushed back 
production and deliveries of the Max 10 by anything up to two years," he said.
"We have agreed with Boeing that we will be first in the queue when it comes to a discussion on Max 10 availability 
and pricing and it is something certainly we would be looking at going forward," O'Leary added.
Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said that the carrier has no cash flow related to capital expenditure 
between now and March 2021, even with 30 Max aircraft due for delivery in the first half of next year.
While the Dublin-headquartered carrier received (EURO)250 million ($287 million) of "supplier reimbursements" in 
the second quarter, compensation discussions will not be finalised or concluded with Boeing until the Max returns to 
service and revised delivery schedules can be finalised and agreed.
Ryanair may consider Ex-Im financing in "~crisis' scenario
At the end of its first half, on 30 September, Ryanair had more than (EURO)4.5 billion of cash available and a fleet 
with a book value of over (EURO)7 billion.
O'Leary said the group has no plans to raise additional debt or equity in the market, unless there is no prospect of a 
vaccine and the Covid-19 crisis stretches out several years.
With £660 million ($757 million) of UK government-backed financing and another (EURO)850 million bond that 
matures in 2021, he estimated the carrier would have approximately (EURO)3.5 million of cash by the middle of the 
year.
He said Ryanair would not go below a reserve of (EURO)1 billion of cash.
O'Leary said Ryanair would be open to extending the lease contracts of existing aircraft if lessors were prepared to 
offer attractive rates.
Aircraft rentals fell by 83% to (EURO)4.8 million in the six months to 30 September due to 14 fewer leased 737 
aircraft in the fleet.
Ryanair suffered a 99% drop in profits in the second quarter, to (EURO)10.6 million, from (EURO)1 billion in the 
same period a year before.
Revenues fell 66% to (EURO)1.05 billion from (EURO)3.07 billion in the same three months in 2019. Operating 
expenses fell 50% to just over (EURO)1 billion, from (EURO)2.06 billion the year before.

Shares in publicly listed aircraft lessors rose by double-digit figures amid a general uplift in aviation-related stock on 
the back of news that an effective Covid-19 vaccine has been developed.
Aercap's share price rose by more than 31% on 9 November to $35.5 per share. The stock price remains below a 
pandemic high of just over $40 achieved in June and below Aercap's pre-pandemic level of $62.6 on 20 February.
Air Lease's (ALC) share price rose 18%, rising from $30.6 on 6 November to over $36 during trading on 9 
November. The price remains 2% below a high the US lessor's stock reached on 8 June of almost $37.
The price is still some 19% down from a pre-pandemic $44.6 on 20 February. ALC also released its third-quarter 
results on 9 November after markets closed. 
BOC Aviation shares rose 20% to HKD64.3 ($8.16), but remain 15% lower than on 20 February.
Fly Leasing's share price rose more than 20%, ending trading at over $7.62 up from $6.28 on 6 November.
Shares in Chorus Aviation rose almost 20% on 9 November to end trading at C$3.58 ($2.71). The Canadian lessor 
and airline company's shares remain more than 50% below their pre-pandemic levels.
Avation's stock price rose more than 26% from £0.92 per share ($1.20) to £1.17 per share. It remains well below its 
£3.22 stock price in mid-February.
The rise in lessor share values reflected a general uplift in aviation stocks after it was announced that Pfizer and 
BioNTech had successfully tested a Covid-19 vaccine that appears to be 90% effective in preventing infection.
IAG's share price rose around 25% to around £1.30 at the end of trading on 9 November. Air France-KLM's share 
price rose almost 30%. Ryanair's share price was up almost 17% at the end of trading.
Airbus's share price was up 25% at (EURO)87.5 on the back of the news and Boeing was up almost 14%. In a 
research note, Jefferies said that caution was needed around the news and what it means for the aviation sector.
"We're not sure that's happened. It probably depends on your standpoint. What we believe an effective vaccine 
brings is a more certain timeline, hence an ability to look forward perhaps 2-3 years.
Lessor shares fly on vaccine hopes
"The snag is that it might take that long for the airline industry to rebuild balance sheets. However, what Airbus 
achieved in 2Q20 and 3Q20 was impressive".
Jefferies noted that the recovery in Chinese and Russian domestic airline traffic and the recoveries it sees unfolding 
in Brazil and Japan show that a "willingness to fly exists, provided it's possible to behave normally at one's 
destination".

Easyjet has sold the bulk of its slot portfolio at London Stansted to rival low-cost carrier Ryanair, but does not plan 
further divestments, it said.
A notice on the UK airport slot coordinator's website shows that Easyjet has sold 312 weekly slots at the London 
airport to Ryanair.
Easyjet confirmed earlier this year that it would close its base at Stansted on 29 August, although some flights from 
the London airport would continue to be operated.
Easyjet told Airfinance Journal it retained some slots at Stansted.
Speaking on an analyst call on 17 November, Easyjet chief financial officer Andrew Findlay said that the UK carrier 
had decided to make an "opportunistic disposal" of the Stansted slots.
He said the airline undertakes seasonal slot transfers on a regular basis, but has no plans for further slot sales at 
this point.
Findlay said that while "clearly a lot of our slots are extremely valuable", Easyjet remains intent on protecting those 
"valuable locations" as part of its network strategy.

Berlin's long-delayed BER airport to open as pandemic bites
Berlin's long-delayed BER airport to open as pandemic bites

Dateline: Berlin (dpa) - 
Body
The German capital is set to launch its new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport on Saturday, but without much fanfare as 
the coronavirus crisis presents the long-delayed project with its biggest challenge yet.
The airport, known by its three-letter code BER, is intended to overhaul the city's ageing air transport infrastructure.
The opening comes nine years behind schedule, while the budget has roughly tripled to 5.96 billion euros (7.04 
billion dollars) over the course of the new airport's already long history of setbacks and construction gaffes.
The pandemic has also added to spiralling costs for the state-backed operator of the airport.
The company is getting an additional 300 million euros from federal and state governments to get the airport 
through this crisis year, with another loan of around 550 million euros promised for next year.
Due to the economic uncertainty unleashed by the crisis, it remains unclear when the airport will become profitable.
Saturday's launch will apply only to Terminal 1; a recently finished Terminal 2 will not be needed initially after 
passenger numbers plunged to just 20 per cent of the 100,000 flyers that usually pass through Berlin's airports 
daily.
BER has incorporated Schoenefeld Airport, also located on the south-eastern outskirts of Berlin, as its Terminal 5.
Berlin's other airport, Tegel, located north-west of the city centre, is scheduled to close on November 8.
Two planes, from Easyjet and Ryanair, are set to become the first to land at the new airport at around 2 pm (1300 
GMT).

Ryanair to suspend ops at four out of five Irish airports

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will suspend operations at four of the five airports in its home market - Cork, Kerry, Knock, 
and Shannon - for four weeks, blaming Ireland's strict coronavirus travel restrictions, the airline revealed in a 
statement on October 27. From November 14 until December 12, the only airport it will fly from in Ireland will be 
Dublin Int'l, but flights from the other airports "will resume" ahead of Christmas, the statement said. Under rules that 
will last at least until December 1, Irish residents are advised against all non-essential travel taking them more than 
five kilometres from home. On October 28, Ireland reported the lowest number of covid-19 cases for almost three 
weeks, its seven-day average falling for the seventh consecutive day after the country deployed some of Europe's 
tightest restrictions. 
"As a result of continuous government mismanagement and a complete collapse in travel demand, additional cuts 
regrettably had to be made across our Irish airports," the Ryanair statement said. According to the ch-aviation 
capacities module, Ryanair currently operates 73 services from Ireland, 62 of which are from Dublin. The remainder 
are three from Cork, to London Stansted (7x weekly), Katowice (2x weekly), and Gdansk (1x weekly); three from 
Knock, to London Luton (3x weekly), Liverpool (2x weekly), and London Stansted (2x weekly); three from Shannon, 
to London Stansted (5x weekly), Manchester Int'l (2x weekly), and Wroclaw (1x weekly); and two from Kerry, to 
London Luton (2x weekly) and London Stansted (2x weekly). Earlier in October, Ryanair further cut its overall 
planned winter capacity to 40% of what it operated last year, down from a previous forecast of 60%. Knock, also 
known as Ireland West Airport, said in a statement on October 27 that it would close for the same four-week period 
as a result of the Ryanair suspension and "due to a complete collapse in travel demand."

Ryanair to temporarily suspend operations at four Irish airports
Ryanair to temporarily suspend operations at four Irish airports

Highlight: Ryanair has decided to suspend operations at four Irish airports for four weeks amid weak travel 
demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Body
The move will involve temporarily ceasing Ryanair services at Cork, Kerry, Ireland West and Shannon airports from 
14 November to 12 December this year. However, the low-cost airline will continue to operate flights from Dublin 
Airport. 
It aims to resume services before Christmas. According to a Reuters report, stringent Covid-19 restrictions in the 
country forced Ryanair to take the decision. Under current rules, people in Ireland are advised to avoid all non-
essential travel more than 5km from home. The airline said in a statement: "As a result of continuous government 
mismanagement and a complete collapse in travel demand, additional cuts regrettably had to be made across our 
Irish airports." This year, Ryanair also plans to operate around 40% of the capacity it operated last year during the 
winter season. Following the announcement, Cork Airport managing director Niall MacCarthy expressed his 
concern over the decision. MacCarthy said: "The news that Ryanair will be cancelling all flights from Cork Airport for 
a four-week period from mid-November to mid-December is a further body blow to the Irish aviation industry and to 
Cork and the South of Ireland in particular. "The Irish aviation ecosystem is already extremely weakened and fragile 
and each blow delivers further incremental damage." Earlier this month, it was reported that Ireland is planning to 
introduce airport Covid-19 testing to support the struggling aviation sector.

EasyJet raises £300m in aircraft leasebacks to tackle mounting losses Airlines

EasyJet has raised £300m through selling and leasing back part of its fleet as the low-cost carrier tries to shore up 
its finances.
The push for new cash comes after the airline revealed this month that its losses had soared to more than £800m 
this year - the first in its 25-year history - and called for more government support for the aviation industry.
The sale and leaseback of nine of its workhorse A320 aircraft will raise just over £306m and is the second time the 
airline has sold off planes this year.
EasyJet said it would continue to look for future funding opportunities and that it had seen "high levels of demand" 
in the multibillion-dollar leasing market. The carrier still owns 152 aircraft, about 45 per cent of its fleet.
A boom in aircraft financing helped support the airline industry's rapid growth before the pandemic.
As crisis has hit, lessors have typically sought to do deals with stronger airlines, including easyJet, which offer a 
more secure rental stream.
Five of easyJet's planes have been sold to lender and wealth manager Wilmington Trust for $191.1m and will be 
leased back for an average of 117 months.
EasyJet raises £300m in aircraft leasebacks to tackle mounting losses Airlines
A second deal with Ireland's Sky High 112 Leasing Company will generate $207.5m in cash, with the aircraft leased 
for an average of 116 months.
Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody, said the sale and leaseback deals "extend the period over which 
easyJet can survive" the crisis.
He estimated that they would lead to monthly leasing rates of $275,000 for the first five aircraft and $303,500 for the 
following four. The terms are "not especially attractive" but the extra cash "will outweigh that factor in the shorter 
term", Mr Simpson said.
The low-cost carrier has raised about £2.7bn to help see it through the crisis, including tapping UK government 
Covid-19 relief programmes for £600m, a £400m share placement and a previous programme of aircraft sale and 
leasebacks that generated £600m.
Like all of its rivals, easyJet has been forced to slash its winter schedules as a second wave of the virus 
extinguishes any hope of a recovery in air travel.
Shares in easyJet retreated 3 per cent yesterday. They have fallen about 60 per cent this year, far more than rivals 
Ryanair and Wizz Air that have lower cost bases.

5:46 a.m. ET  First Published: Oct. 27, 2020 at 4:15 p.m. ET Passenger traffic at Europe's airports fell 73% in 
September, compared with the same month in 2019, according to industry trade body ACI Europe. 
 ina fassbender/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Nearly 200 airports in Europe will face financial collapse in 
the coming months if passenger traffic doesn't recover by the end of the year. That is the stark warning from 
industry trade body ACI Europe[1], which said on Tuesday that 193 airports, out of 740 airports in the region, will 
struggle to stay solvent without government help.Regional hubs were most at risk, where collapse would create a 
ripple-effect upon local employment and economies. Collectively, Europe's airports support an estimated 277,000 
jobs and €12.4 billion of European gross domestic product. Passenger traffic at Europe's airports fell 73% in 
September, compared with the same month in 2019, bringing the total volume of lost passengers since January 
2020 to 1.29 billion.  Regional German airport Paderborn/Lippstadt[2]filed for insolvency proceedings in September, 
after passenger numbers fell 85% on the same period last year. 'The figures published today paint a dramatically 
bleak picture,' said Olivier Jankovec, director general of ACI Europe. 'Eight months into the crisis, all of Europe's 
airports are burning through cash to remain open, with revenues far from covering the costs of operations, let alone 
capital costs. Governments' current imposition of quarantines rather than testing is bringing Europe's airports closer 
to the brink with every day that passes,' Jankovec added. Read:Heathrow offers rapid one-hour COVID-19 tests — 
they aren't cheap[3]  The top 20 European airports have added €16 billion of debt, equivalent to nearly 60% of their 
revenues in a normal year, as they turn to the financial markets to shore up balance sheets and build emergency 
war chests, ACI Europe said. The figures came as low cost airline easyJet agreed on Tuesday to sell nine more 
planes[4], raising $398.6 millionto help boost its balance sheet. Wealth management firm Wilmington Trust Services 
will buy five Airbus 320s, and aircraft leasing firm Sky High 112 will buy the remaining four 320s. On Oct. 8, easyJet 
EZJ, -1.92%[5] slashed flights to 25% of its normal level and urged the U.K. government to help airlines survive the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as it reported its first loss in its 25-year history.[6] Just days later, rival Irish carrier Ryanair 
RYAAY, -4.08%[7] slashed its winter flight capacity from 60% to 40% of the previous year's level, blaming 
restrictions imposed by European governments. Read:United Airlines tests COVID-19 'health pass' to kick-start 
global travel again [8] Last week, Heathrow Airport launched the U.K.'s first pre-departure testing facility, allowing 
passengers flying from London Heathrow to Hong Kong and Italy to get rapid COVID-19 tests before checking in.  
The test, which can be booked online, costs80[9]($104), and results will be available within 60 minutes.

International Consolidated Airlines IAG, -1.61%[10] -owned British Airways, Virgin Atlantic (49% owned by Delta Air 
Lines DAL, -3.82%[11] ), and Cathay Pacific will be the first airlines to offer the testing facility.  The post : Almost

Ryanair yesterday announced they will suspend flight operations from Ireland West Airport and the other regional 
airports from Saturday, November 14th until Sunday, December 13th 2020.
The airline has announced the suspension of flight services due to a complete collapse in travel demand as a result 
of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current travel restrictions in place. 
Following today’s announcement and the suspension of all commercial flights from the airport with Ryanair, Ireland 
West Airport will close on November 14th and reopen on Sunday December 13th. Passenger numbers this year 
have plummeted by over 90% with annual passenger numbers now forecasted to decline to less than 150,000 for 
the full year – the lowest in over 20 years. 
The airport is calling on Government to provide urgent support through an expanded regional airports programme 
for the airport to address the enormous financial losses to support and protect its cash position resulting from the 
devastating collapse in passenger traffic as a result of COVID-19 which have been further impacted following 
yesterday's announcement by Ryanair.

The EU markets regulator has taken steps to partly assuage investor concerns over trading after Brexit by 
indicating that EU investors will be able to trade sterling-quoted shares of European companies listed in London. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority made the policy change yesterday because of fears among 
busines-ses and some EU governments that the bloc's regulations could fragment the market and cut off European 
companies from deep pools of capital in London.
The Paris-based agency said trading of EU shares on a UK exchange in pounds will be exempt from an EU rule, 
known as the share trading obligation, which determines which venues investors can use to trade.
That means EU investors will still be able to trade dual-listed companies such as AstraZeneca, Relx, Tui, British 
Airways parent IAG and G4S in London as those companies are listed in sterling.
However, many Irish companies, such as Ryanair, Kingspan and Bank of Ireland, will remain vulnerable as they 
trade in euros.
One industry lobbyist in Brussels said it was "the narrowest of accommodations", adding that it "does not solve 
what Ireland needs". Another called it "pretty underwhelming".
Brussels acts to ease Brexit jitters over dual listings ? Policy shift to appease EU investors ? Sterling-quoted 
share trades exempt
Normally, EU investors can buy and sell stocks only in countries Brussels has deemed to have a regulatory and 
supervisory system as rigorous as the EU's own - a system known as "equivalence". London is the biggest share 
trad-ing centre in Europe, handling more than a quarter of the (EURO)40bn daily market. Without equivalence, 
some of that business will move to Amsterdam and Paris because EU-based institutions will be barred from trading 
in London.
Esma estimated the policy change accounted for less than 1 per cent of total EU trading. There were fewer than 50 
companies trading in London with an EU identification code, or ISIN, it said.
So far the European Commission has given no indication of whether a decision on equivalence will be forthcoming 
for the UK. It has instead warned that a lack of clarity on the details of Britain's future regulatory regime have made 
such assessments difficult.
Banks, high-frequency traders and asset managers across Europe had been losing hope that London and Brussels 
will agree to keep the cross-border share trading market intact beyond January.
The commission told the Financial Times last week that equivalence assessments "are challenging because they 
will have to be forward-looking, taking into account overall developments, including any intention by the UK to 
diverge from EU rules".
But the ambiguity worried EU governments, which last month discussed enacting emergency legislation to stave off 
the threat to dual-listed shares - prompting Brussels to complain that such a move would signal weakness at a 
sensitive moment in the Brexit talks. It turned to Esma for a solution.
Esma insisted it had done "the maximum possible" to minimise market disruption. But it warned that its UK 
counterpart, the Financial Conduct Authority, needed to make concessions with its own rules for the solution to 
work.
The comments reflect the risk that traders could, in theory, be faced with conflicting EU and UK rules on duallisted 
shares unless both sides grant the necessary regulatory permissions.

Esma insisted it had done "the maximum possible" to minimise market disruption. But it warned that its UK 
counterpart, the Financial Conduct Authority, needed to make concessions with its own rules for the solution to 
work.
The comments reflect the risk that traders could, in theory, be faced with conflicting EU and UK rules on duallisted 
shares unless both sides grant the necessary regulatory permissions.
This is 'the narrowest of accommodations' that 'does not solve what Ireland needs'

Wizz Looks to Conquer the World, or At Least Europe

Oct 27, 2020( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  I used to think of Wizz as that 
Central/Eastern European airline with the goofy name and pink and purple airplanes. That image is outdated, to say 
the least. Sure, it still has the name and colors, but make no mistake about it; Wizz is a European powerhouse. 
It's the Ryanair of Central and Eastern Europe, and I mean that as the highest praise. But it's more than that, and it 
continues to grow quickly. While many airlines see the COVID pandemic as a threat to their very existence, Wizz 
sees nothing but opportunity. The airline was founded in Hungary in 2003 with its first flight in 2004. Its main 
investor was Indigo Partners, Bill Franke's company that has backed Spirit, Frontier, Volaris, Tiger, Sky, and 
more.Wizz's initial wheelhouse was in the middle of the continent, but it has always had an important presence in 
London via far-out Luton as well.  Wizz Air % of Scheduled Departures by Region 2004 - 2020 In this chart, the pink 
shading in the back shows the number of scheduled departures by year using Cirium's[1] schedule data. Wizz has 
been growing at a breakneck pace. It first hit 100 daily departures in 2008, 200 in 2011, 300 in 2015, 400 in 2017, 
500 in 2018, and 600 in 2020. Next year it is on pace to increase from around 610 daily to 693, though everything 
after the pandemic began is not exactly reliable. I'm sure Wizz has schedules in there that aren't being flown. Those 
lines on the chart show the breakdown by region.The initial beauty of Wizz was that it had incredibly low costs and 
was in the right place. As the European Union expanded and borders fell, many of the people from Central and 
Eastern Europe migrated to Western and Southern Europe where the jobs were more plentiful and better paying. 
That created an instant need for cheap flights to get friends and family back and forth.In Wizz's first full year of 
operation, 2005, its two largest bases were Poland and the UK. Since that time, Wizz has tried a lot of things and 
failed a fair bit. That, however, is perfectly acceptable. Without trying, the airline wouldn't have had so much 
success along the way. Here's something of a scorecard. Wizz WinsAustria - Jumped into Vienna in 2018 when 
airberlin failed and every airline tried to join the party. While others have pulled out , Wizz has only grown, recently 
adding Salzburg as well.Germany - Dortmund began in 2004 and has become huge for the airline. Half of the 
airline's German flights depart from there. Memmingen, Cologne, and Berlin have all succeeded too.Moldova - It's 
not a big place, but after starting in 2013, it now runs about half the flights touching the country. Many smaller 
European countries have seen this same trend.Poland - The first Wizz route was to Poland, and it now serves 9 
cities in the country with more than 25,000 flights a year.Romania - Wizz didn't even start serving the country until 
2006, but it really stepped on the gas in recent years. In 2020, Romania was the number two country for the airline 
behind Poland and just ahead of the UK.United Kingdom - Started London/Luton flying early and has done nothing 
Wizz Looks to Conquer the World, or At Least Europe
but expand since then.Wizz LossesEgypt - First tried to serve the market from Ukraine in 2008 to 2010, then tried 
from Poland in 2014 and Hungary in 2015 but hasn't been back.Germany - A winner and a loser Secondary airports 
in big cities (where Ryanair flies) have not done well. Wizz left Lubeck for Hamburg in 2016 and abandoned Weeze 
in 2012 without even trying Dusseldorf.Ireland - Entered in 2006, but thanks to weak demand and competition from 
Ryanair, it left in 2013.Turkey - There have been a couple efforts to serve Turkey both from Hungary and Ukraine. 
The airline left in 2016 and hasn't returned.Ukraine - Wizz was bullish on Ukraine to the point that it started a 
locally-based subsidiary in 2008. As Ukraine's fortunes go, however, so do Wizz's. The Ukrainian airline is gone, 
but it still remains an important point for the Hungarian airline. And it has begun growing again, so maybe there's 
long term hope. On the whole, this penchant for trying new things and accepting failure has served the airline well. 
Now, with the pandemic, it is throwing things into overdrive.While most airlines are looking to defer aircraft 
deliveries, Wizz is actually speeding them up[2]. It has been watching airlines pull back during the pandemic, and it 
smells opportunity, adding routes at a furious pace. Here are some of the bigger projects. Wizz New 
ExperimentsItaly - Opened a base at Milan/Malpensa in July and Catania just this month. It also just announced a 
coming base in Bari. It continues to grow throughout the country.Norway - After a long-standing presence, finally 
opening a base in Oslo. Also opening a base in Trondheim. It is beginning domestic Norway flights, clearly looking 
to kill off Norwegian.Russia - Decided to open a base at St Petersburg in September with growth already baked 
in.United Arab Emirates - Has served Dubai/World Central a little, but now created Wizz Abu Dhabi with flights to 
Athens, Alexandria (Egypt), Kutaisi, Larnca, Odesa, and Yerevan starting soon. The airline just received its 
operating certificate and has big plans.United Kingdom - Opened bases at Doncaster and Gatwick this month. 
Gatwick has been served since 2016, but now it will base aircraft and wants to grow as fast as it can gets slots. The 
Abu Dhabi airline is interesting since it's made possible by the A321neo which is now on the property at the airline. 
There are more opportunities like that further afield. As long as it doesn't require a widebody, Wizz is going to be 
curious.Keep an eye on these guys, and don't be surprised if Wizz ends up being a good option on your next trip 
within Europe. There's no end to the airline's growth in sight. Not everything will work, but if this success rate 
continues, that's still a winning strategy. [ 1]: http://cirium.com [ 2]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-

Corporate Europe has the edge over the US - for now The Top Line Tom Braithwaite

While New York and San Francisco hunkered down this summer, it was possible to fly from London to Lisbon and 
enjoy a holiday, largely untroubled by the virus. Then in September, as many US schools stayed shut, term started 
on time in most of Europe.
The sunnier period on the eastern side of the Atlantic seems to be reflected in corporate results. A quarter of the 
way into earnings season, profits from S&P 500 companies are down 14 per cent in aggregate, according to 
FactSet data. Third-quarter earnings for the first 150 companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 to report are 20 per cent 
higher than in the same period last year.
Beyond the headlines there is plenty of success. Robotic lawnmowers were a big hit for Sweden's Husqvarna as 
shutins tended their gardens. Webcam sales rose 250 per cent at Swiss peripherals company Logitech as office 
refugees set up their home work stations. Swedish medical device maker Getinge delivered more of its ventilators 
in the quarter than it used to in a year. Dutch chip companies ASML and BE Semiconductor reported earnings 
growth of more than 70 per cent. In brute force of dollars earned, UBS made the biggest contribution, doubling 
profits to $2.2bn.
The problem for Europe bulls is that, much like fading resilience to the effects of the virus, which has walloped 
London and Paris for a second time, the continent's relative advantage is likely to dwindle before the end of 
earnings season.
Corporate Europe has the edge over the US - for now The Top Line Tom Braithwaite
By then, according to analysts' estimates collated by FactSet, the Stoxx 600 companies are expected to lurch to a 
31 per cent decline, and the US S&P 500 companies a 16 per cent drop.
Europe is braced for dire results from the likes of French automotive supplier Valeo as well as Lufthansa, Ryanair 
and Shell. Although the US has its own looming loss generators in the form of Walt Disney, Boeing and 
ExxonMobil, it boasts more winners from the pandemic to cushion the blow.
The US numbers already reflect Covid testing beneficiaries Quest Diagnostics, where earnings surged more than 
140 per cent, and Thermo Fisher, where profits are up 89 per cent. Still to come are Clorox, benefiting from our 
newfound love of bleach, and Home Depot, enjoying the home improvement craze.
Decisive in the contest: the US still has the heavy artillery in reserve from the tech sector. Amazon's profits are 
expected to be up more than 70 per cent. Fellow trillionaires Alphabet and Microsoft are also forecast to produce 
stronger earnings.
Looked at optimistically, neither set of results so far is as bad as expected. A few weeks ago, the Euro Stoxx 600 
earnings had been forecast to fall more than a third and the S&P 500 more than a fifth. As Jonathan Golub, chief 
US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, points out, the second quarter was the biggest beat to analysts' expectations 
since records began in 1990. The third quarter looks to be much stronger than anticipated too, even though 
forecasts have been steadily increasing. "When we have a really big beat here we have a beat on higher 
expectations," he notes.
More worrying, especially for Europe now hit hard by the second wave, is that the fourth quarter is looking tougher 
after the relative respite of the summer. It will be harder to prop up profits. Investors and executives on both sides of 
the Atlantic will focus more on external deliverance: economic stimulus and vaccines.

IAG cuts winter flight schedule after (EURO)1.3bn loss Airlines Travel curbs dash BA parent's hopes of

IAG cuts winter flight schedule after (EURO)1.3bn loss; Airlines Travel curbs 
dash BA parent's hopes of recovery as revenues decline 83%

International Airlines Group has slashed its flight schedule for the rest of the year and said its operations lost more 
than (EURO)1bn in the third quarter as travel restrictions dash hopes of a recovery.
The British Airways owner said bookings were lower than expected because of the rise in new coronavirus cases in 
its biggest markets, leaving travellers facing lengthy quarantine periods.
IAG's stable of airlines including BA, Iberia and Vueling intends to fly 30 per cent of last year's schedule in the final 
three months of the year, down from a previously planned 40 per cent.
The company will announce full third-quarter results next week and said that it would record an operating loss, 
before exceptional items, of (EURO)1.3bn for the period, worse than market expectations.
The loss in the third quarter, a period when flights were meant to be ramping back up, is only marginally better than 
the performance for the second quarter, when lockdowns were in full force.
Revenues fell 83 per cent to (EURO)1.2bn.
Given that the group's planes were flying on average less than 50 per cent full in the third quarter, "we would expect 
a significant number of flights to be lossmaking", said Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein.
IAG cuts winter flight schedule after (EURO)1.3bn loss Airlines Travel curbs dash BA parent's hopes of 
recovery as revenues decline 83%
IAG stock rose 4.4 per cent yesterday. The airline conglomerate will miss its break-even target for net cash flow 
from operating activities during the final quarter of the year, a measure closely watched by investors.
"Management will need to significantly lower monthly cash burn to avoid significantly depleting resources by next 
summer," Mr Roeska said.
IAG said it was well capitalised and had (EURO)9.3bn in total liquidity by the end of September following a 
(EURO)2.75bn rights issue completed last month.
Airlines have been forced to dial back recovery plans after quarantine rules and a resurgence of Covid-19 infections 
pushed the industry-wide crisis deep into the typically lean winter months.
EasyJet will fly only 25 per cent of last year's capacity in the final three months of this year, while Ryanair plans to 
fly 40 per cent of last year's schedule between November and March.
Luis Gallego, IAG's newly installed chief executive, last week shook up management at BA, its biggest airline, 
replacing Alex Cruz with Aer Lingus chief Sean Doyle.
In a sign of airlines' anxiety, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive yesterday questioned the data underpinning the 
government's reluctance to allow an airport testing programme.
Shai Weiss said that the government was relying on a "flawed and outdated" model from Public Health England that 
suggested testing on arrival would pick up only 7 per cent of virus cases.
Ministers should consider new research, commissioned by the aviation industry, that concluded that testing could 
pick up about 60 per cent of coronavirus cases, he said.
"We urgently need the introduction of a passenger testing regime here in the UK," Mr Weiss added.

"Management will need to significantly lower monthly cash burn to avoid significantly depleting resources by next 
summer," Mr Roeska said.
IAG said it was well capitalised and had (EURO)9.3bn in total liquidity by the end of September following a 
(EURO)2.75bn rights issue completed last month.
Airlines have been forced to dial back recovery plans after quarantine rules and a resurgence of Covid-19 infections 
pushed the industry-wide crisis deep into the typically lean winter months.
EasyJet will fly only 25 per cent of last year's capacity in the final three months of this year, while Ryanair plans to 
fly 40 per cent of last year's schedule between November and March.
Luis Gallego, IAG's newly installed chief executive, last week shook up management at BA, its biggest airline, 
replacing Alex Cruz with Aer Lingus chief Sean Doyle.
In a sign of airlines' desperate desire to reopen the skies, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive yesterday questioned the 
data underpinning the UK government's reluctance to allow an airport testing programme.
Shai Weiss said that the government was relying on a "flawed and outdated" model from Public Health England that 
suggested that testing on arrival would only pick up 7 per cent of virus cases.
He added that ministers should consider new research, commissioned by the aviation industry, that claimed that 
testing could pick up about 60 per cent of cases.
"We urgently need the introduction of a passenger testing regime here in the UK," Mr Weiss said.
The airline conglomerate intends to fly 30% of last year's schedule in the final three months of the year

Don't fly away is British Airways owner's tough ask of investors
Don't fly away is British Airways owner's tough ask of investors

Unlike songster John Denver, very few of us are Leaving on a Jet Plane. Least of all in the regions that IAG, owner 
of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, operates in. It is exposed to the geographies most restricted by the pandemic 
- Spain, the UK, Ireland and the Americas.
In yesterday's unexpected update, it said it was grounding more planes and capacity in the fourth quarter would be 
30 per cent of what it was last year. It doesn't expect to return fully to 2019 levels for at least three years. A few 
weeks ago it had hoped that capacity would be at 40 per cent and its net cash flows would break even. But that was 
before the second wave, an increase in local lockdowns and extended quarantine requirements in more countries.
Now, the group admits it won't break even on cash in the next three months.
IAG has done what it can and should to contain the leakage. It is cutting jobs - 10,000 at the last count at BA - and 
capital expenditure. It is restructuring parts of the business and this month raised (EURO)2.7bn in new equity to 
buttress the balance sheet and reduce debt, which stood at a mighty (EURO)10.5bn at the end of June.
The group talks of (EURO)9.3bn in liquidity. Davy analyst Stephen Furlong reckons the company is burning through 
about (EURO)750m a month and has access to enough cash to cover it for another 12 to 16 months. It is more 
squeezed than Ryanair but not as squeezed as easyJet.
But IAG needs trippers and business travellers to start booking summer flights in the first quarter. If the cash 
doesn't start coming, it has to find other sources of readies. Cathay Pacific, which was bailed out by the Hong Kong 
Don't fly away is British Airways owner's tough ask of investors
government in June, has this week announced it is cutting a quarter of the workforce and the immediate closure of 
its regional flag carrier, Cathay Dragon. Unbundling the bundle that is IAG would be more complex and take time. In 
extremis, a further call on the debt or equity markets could be accompanied by part-nationalisation.
Like John Denver, whose ditty was used by United Airlines' commercials in the 1960s and 1970s, IAG still hopes 
investors will wait for it, and hold it like they'll never let it go. It is a tough ask when the shares are trading around 
the lows and no one knows when - if ever - they'll be back again.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) is now offering refunds to passengers for cancelled flights after facing investigation by Italy's

were enforced, Reuters reported Friday, citing the regulator.
The choice to receive either a voucher or a refund would be left to the customer, according to the report.

 Italy's antitrust regulator said four under-investigation airlines including Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) and easyJet 
(EZJ.L) agreed to offer refunds to customers for flights canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuter reported 
Friday.
The Italian competition authority, AGCM, launched separate investigations into Ryanair, easyJet, Vueling and Blue 
Panorama after customers complained that the airlines only offered a voucher and not a refund.
The regulator said that it will continue its own probe into potential wrong commercial practices by the airlines.
Ryanair shares were up almost 2%, while easyJet was up nearly 3% on Friday morning.

Italian regulators said on Friday they had convinced four low-cost airlines, including Ryanair, to give refunds - rather 
than just vouchers - for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus.
The Italian competition authority (AGCM) said it would no longer pursue an antitrust probe against Ryanair, 
easyJet, Vueling and Blue Panorama, since they complied with its requests.
As well as giving the option of a refund, the four airlines also agreed to allow free-of-charge access to their 
customer services and increase staffing at their call centres, the authority said.
AGCM had started proceedings against the carriers in late September.

More layoffs as Ryanair cuts Winter 2020/21 schedule
More layoffs as Ryanair cuts Winter 2020/21 schedule

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has warned of more cabin crew layoffs as it cuts a third off its winter schedule in response 
to further COVID-19 air travel restrictions across Europe. The airline in a statement said increased flight restrictions 
imposed by European Union governments have heavily curtailed air travel in Central Europe, the UK, Ireland, 
Austria, Belgium, and Portugal. This has caused forward bookings to weaken slightly in October, but materially in 
November and December. 
In order to maintain 70% break-even load factors on routes and minimise cash burn, the airline must now further 
reduce its winter schedule for November 2020 through to March 2021. Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said 
the airline would cut its capacity from 60% to 40%. It still expects to maintain up to 65% of its winter route network, 
but with reduced frequencies. It is already temporarily shutting bases this winter in Cork and Shannon in Ireland, 
and at Toulouse Blagnac, France. It will also significantly cut the number of flights from bases including those in 
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, and Spain. O'Leary said Ryanair expected full-year (FY2021) traffic to fall to 
38 million passengers, although this number could fall further if EU governments imposed more lockdowns this 
winter. Last year, it carried 150.3 million passengers. In September 2020, it had operated about 53% of its normal 
schedule, with passenger numbers having fallen 64% to 5.1 million from 14.1 million in September 2019. All this 
meant more cabin crew redundancies could not be avoided, O'Leary explained. "There will regrettably be more 
redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases, where we have still not secured agreement on working 
time and pay cuts, which is the only alternative". "It is inevitable, given the scale of these cutbacks, that we will be 
implementing more unpaid leave and job sharing this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working 
time and pay, but this is a better short-term outcome than mass job losses," he said.

Aer Lingus owner warns of deepening travel slump as losses mount
Aer Lingus owner warns of deepening travel slump as losses mount

Aer Lingus owner IAG warned the travel slump from the coronavirus pandemic had deepened, forcing it to axe even 
more of its winter flying schedule after it reported on Thursday a quarterly loss of 1.3 billion euros.
The loss was far larger than the 920 million euros forecast by analysts, as passenger numbers plunged and it 
struggled to even half-fill its planes, illustrating the scale of the challenge faced by IAG's new boss, Luis Gallego, 
who took over in September.
As a second wave of COVID-19 infections spreads across Europe, airlines are facing a bleak winter and IAG joins 
Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet in cutting back already anemic schedules.
IAG, which also operates Iberia and Vueling in Spain and British Airways in Britain, said that for the fourth quarter - 
which includes the normally busy Christmas period - it would fly no more than 30% of the capacity it flew a year 
earlier, lower than previous guidance of 40%.
Shares in the company dropped 3% to 97 pence at 0816 GMT. The stock has lost 78% in the year-to-date as the 
pandemic has crushed its business.
With less flying ahead, the group warned it no longer expected to reach breakeven in terms of net cash flow from 
operations in the fourth quarter, but said that liquidity was strong.
The company has raised 2.74 billion euros from shareholders via a rights issue and received the funds in early 
October, raising its total liquidity to 9.3 billion euros.
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said even with that buffer IAG needed to focus on reducing costs.

"Management will need to significantly lower monthly cash burn to avoid significantly depleting resources by next 
summer," he said.
But Goodbody analysts said that total liquidity was positive and IAG would be ready for a recovery in demand next 
spring.
IAG said it was operating in an environment of "high uncertainty." It has been calling for COVID-19 tests at airports 
to replace quarantine requirements and said that governments had been slower than it expected to adopt such 
measures.
IAG said it would provide more detailed results on Oct. 30. (Reuters)

this page has been deleted. Discussion of markets and holdingsOctober 15, 2020 Dear Fellow Shareholder, Global 
equity markets rose in the third quarter of 2020, building on the prior quarter's gains. Most countries and sectors 
advanced, supported by governments' stimulus measures intended to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. 
Corporate results have become progressively "better", as companies report modest losses in the third quarter. 
While infection rates subsided from May to August, the expected second wave of COVID-19 cropped up in many 
countries by September. Yet the economic impact of this second wave may be muted, as health care systems 
begin to understand how to treat the disease and potential vaccines progress quickly. Investors appear to be 
expecting more progress and recovery, as evidenced by upbeat market returns. For the third quarter of 2020, the 
Polaris Global Value Fund ("the Fund") gained 4.36%, underperforming the MSCI World Index, which was up 
7.93%. The Fund outperformed the MSCI World Value Index, which was up 3.87%. The Fund had absolute positive 
gains in most sectors, with notable outperformance in consumer discretionary and materials, where the Fund was 
overweight. Detractors included energy, communication services and financials, the latter being an overweight Fund 
position. While the portfolio's U.S. allocation contributed meaningfully to returns, the large underweight relative to 
the benchmark (32% vs. 67%) continued to hamper results. The Fund's more heavily-weighted holdings in the U.K., 
Canada, Norway and Belgium outperformed country benchmarks. Several of the top holdings were investments 
made at the beginning of the pandemic. Polaris had conducted extensive research in January and February, 
deliberately redeploying capital to subsectors historically unattainable due to valuation. When stocks such as 
Dometic Group AB (OSTO:DOM[1]), Darden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE:DRI[2]), Bunzl PLC (LSE:BNZL[3]), Ryanair 
Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA[4]) and Zhongsheng Group Holdings (HKSE:00881[5]) dropped precipitously, Polaris 
snapped up these cash-flow heavy companies on the expectation of participating in a rebound. The decision was 
prescient as all five posted double-digit returns, most in excess of 20%, during the quarter. Detractors like Trevi 
Finanziaria Industrial (MIL:TFI[6]), Taylor Wimpey PLC (LSE:TW.) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) 
retrenched somewhat following the prior quarter's outsized gains. THIRD QUARTER 2020 PERFORMANCE 
ANALYSIS For the second consecutive quarter, the Fund's consumer discretionary holdings contributed most to 
performance. The stock price of L Brands, Inc. (LB) nearly doubled during the quarter, as its Bath &#38; Body 
Works division delivered stellar returns. Online sales of home fragrances, shampoos, soaps and hand sanitizers 
Bernard Horn's Polaris Global Value Fund 3rd-Quarter Letter
ramped up considerably. Investors also reacted favorably to management's ongoing efforts to separate the 
Victoria's Secret brand, while committing to cost cutting measures. South Korean automaker, Kia Motors 
Corp.(XKRX:000270), beat expectations with strong sales of premium and sport SUVs in the U.S. and Korea, as 
well as auto introductions in India. Climate control and convenience products maker for recreational vehicles (RVs), 
Dometic Group, capitalized on the RV travel craze as consumers sought vacation alternatives in light of COVID-19. 
Dometic's aftermarket sales held up well, while its cost cutting and efficiency measures improved margins. U.K. 
retailer Next PLC (LSE:NXT) noted strong first half results, and raised its outlook on the back of continued online 
sales growth; simultaneously, the company reined in cost controls and warehouse capacity. Darden Restaurants, 
the parent of Capital Grille, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse restaurant chains, noted positive sales trends 
in its takeout/delivery service and slowly began re-opening brick-and-mortar sites with much success; the stock 
gained 28% for the quarter. L Brands, Dometic and Darden were sold at a healthy profit, as each reached Polaris' 
valuation limits. The only sector detractor of note was U.K. homebuilder Taylor Wimpey, which declined after the 
company announced lower housing completions in fiscal year 2020 due to COVID-19 distancing restrictions. This 
short-term headwind is expected to reverse course in the second half of 2021, with Taylor Wimpey's management 
projecting firmer order books as construction resumes. Most of materials sector holdings were in positive territory, 
led by Methanex Corp. (TSX:MX), Linde PLC (LIN) and Yara International ASA (OSL:YAR). Canadian methanol 
producer, Methanex, posted steady gains as methanol prices recovered from second quarter 2020 lows. The 
company referenced improving methanol demand within Europe and Asia, specifically in China. Diversification was 
key for Linde's continued success: the company delivered gases to a worldwide client base, grew its U.S. 
home/hospital oxygen therapy business and signed deals in China to produce green hydrogen. The information 
technology (IT) sector dominated returns for the MSCI World Index, with a 22% weighting. The Fund's underweight 
in IT (and other high -momentum stocks) hampered overall portfolio performance. Nevertheless, there were 
numerous bright spots in the sector, including Infosys Ltd. (INFY), Samsung Electronics (XKRX:005930) and Arrow 
Electronics, Inc. (ARW), all of which advanced in excess of 10% for the quarter. Infosys reported profits above 
expectations, citing good cost controls and flexibility/adaptation in serving clients in a COVID-19 contactless 
environment. Infosys also announced several complementary acquisitions during the quarter. Samsung's DRAM 
chip spot prices turned positive, with major customers placing orders to rebuild inventory before the end of 2020, 
when demand is expected to outstrip supply. Additionally, Samsung's foundry business became the sole provider 
for Qualcomm's application processor for premium 5G smartphones. In contrast, Catcher Technology Co. Ltd. 
(TPE:2474) declined after selling two of its Chinese plants used to manufacture Apple iPhone cases. While this 
business approximated 40% of revenue, it was only 10% of profit as a high-volume, low-margin production. Catcher 
kept the more profitable Apple MacBook business inhouse. With the $1.4 billion plant sale to China's Lens 
Technology, Catcher now has more than $4.4 billion net cash. Investors are in a holding pattern, awaiting Catcher's 
next strategic moves to deploy the cash. Industrial sector returns formed into a barbell, with Bunzl, Wesco 
International Inc. (WCC) and Ryanair Holdings up in excess of 20%, while Babcock International (LSE:BAB) and 
Trevi Finanziaria detracted. Bunzl reinstated dividends after reporting higher pre-tax profits in the first half of 2020, 
as its grocery and cleaning/safety divisions rose. The company also announced two acquisitions. U.S. electrical 
goods distributor, Wesco International Inc., posted a strong quarter where sales, margin, profit and cash generation 
exceeded management's expectations. Trevi, the Italian engineering and foundation driller, underwent a complete 
financial and operational restructuring. The stock jumped more than 150% in the second quarter as one of the 
Fund's top performers, but relinquished some of this gain in the third quarter. Trevi may face some near-term 
headwinds, as governmental infrastructure spending is postponed in deference to immediate COVID-19 related 
needs of citizens. However, the company reaffirmed guidance, pointing to strength of its order book. Babcock 
International, the U.K. engineering services firm that supports local defense, emergency services and civil nuclear 
sectors, noted declining profits due to new distancing requirements on ship repair worksites. The stock price slipped 
further after Babcock announced the end of its long-term contract with Britain's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
to clean up 12 Magnox reactor sites in the U.K. Although the largest sector contributor in 2019, financials detracted 
most from returns in the quarter and year- to-date 2020. Upon reopening the global economy post lockdown, 
financials saw a solid recovery in July and August; by September, this trend reversed course on increased COVID-
19 cases. Many banks also encountered lower net interest margins and slower loan growth, while concerns swirled 
about stimulus running dry, raising the risk of defaults. To counteract these issues, banks have set aside large 
reserves and capital to absorb potential losses. In fact, many of the banks have the highest capital ratios and loan 
loss reserves in more than 20 years. For example, Sweden's Svenska Handelsbanken (OSTO:SHB A) shored up 
Bernard Horn's Polaris Global Value Fund 3rd-Quarter Letter
capital by deferring 2020 dividend payments, closing bank branches and restructuring the employees' profit-sharing 
plan. International Bancshares (IBOC) reported underwhelming quarterly earnings, due to added credit loss 
provisions and lower net interest margins. As one of the largest independent banks in Texas, International 
Bancshares remains in a position of relative strength, with a large capital position, strong liquidity and loyal deposit 
base. Many of these well-capitalized financial institutions are trading at single digit multiples, priced lower than 
assumptions for the industry's worst-case scenario. So, we believe the upside potential is substantial in an 
economic recovery, fits and spurts of which are already underway outside the U.S. The stock price of oil refiner 
Marathon Petroleum trended in line with oil supply/demand volatility, jumping up more than 60% from the first to 
second quarter of 2020, only to lose momentum in the third quarter. Brent crude futures fell and Chinese demand 
lessened. Nevertheless, Marathon made strategic top-line (selling Speedway gas stations) and bottom-line 
(reducing expenses and headcount) decisions which should offer some protection against broader commodity 
market tumult. U.K.'s Cineworld Group (LSE:CINE) declined due to delays in theatre re-openings as a result of 
COVID-19. After the quarter end, Cineworld announced plans to shut down all U.S. and U.K. theaters until movie 
studios release blockbuster movies and theater openings are permitted in New York and Los Angeles, where the 
majority of movie critics reside. INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT AND STRATEGY Polaris added more than a dozen 
new stocks to the Fund portfolio in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking advantage of historic lows as 
an entry point. In the ensuing months, many of these companies rebounded dramatically and Polaris sold Darden, 
Ryanair, Dometic and Delta Airlines (DAL) at hefty profits as they reached Polaris' valuation limits. The timing was 
opportune, as a second wave of COVID-19 infection in the Fall season has cast doubt on the robustness of the 
travel/leisure sector in the short-term. Much discussion has surrounded the manner of the American economic 
recovery, with many pundits pointing to a "K" shape recovery, which is a bifurcated rebound with industries like 
technology, retail and software on the rise, while travel, entertainment, hospitality and food service continue their 
downward slide. There is little debate on the shape of recovery in Europe and Asia, as many of these countries are 
trending back to normal commerce. Germany's economy is improving faster than anticipated, helped by a mild and 
short coronavirus lockdown, large-scale fiscal stimulus and Berlin's close trade links with China. France's gross 
domestic product, which shrunk by a record 13.8% in the second quarter of 2020, was forecasted to grow by 17% in 
the third quarter. China is back up to pre-COVID-19 economic activity levels, as businesses reopen, mobility 
increases and consumer spending rises. On this backdrop, many companies are resuming full operations and are 
catching up with demand and adjusting production as needed based on future orders. Yet, business projections and 
investor optimism might be dampened as a second wave follows into a third wave of infection in late 2020. With 
competing macro trends in mind, we have reconstructed the portfolio to add more defensive names with higher 
return profiles and potential for lower downside risk. Among the new purchases are Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Who the F*&@ Is EGO Airways?

Oct 22, 2020( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Get ready for something weird. 
The latest entry in the 'Who the F*&#38;@ is' series is actually an airline with an idea I don't hate and it's Italian. 
This airline appears to be focused on taking advantage of Alitalia's stupidity, and that's a strategy I can get behind. 
That being said, it could turn ugly quickly if too much, ahem, ego gets involved. According to Airways, EGO is 
finalizing plans to start up[1] next summer from its Milan base using Embraer 190/195 aircraft. How on Earth does 
Italy need ANOTHER airline? Ah, well, that's why this is an interesting one. First aircraft named Martina - Image via 
EGO Milan, as you may well know, has two primary airports. Close-in Linate is about 25 minutes just east of town. 
Malpensa lies about a 50 minute drive or train ride further out to the northwest. Linate's relatively-short runway 
(about 8,000 feet) means it doesn't handle any long-haul flights. Those all go over to Malpensa. Malpensa is also 
more convenient to certain parts of the region, including Lake Como and other tourist spots. Despite that, Linate is 
generally viewed as the more convenient, preferable option. It's kind of like a Washington National vs. Dulles 
situation.Over  the years, Alitalia has had a love-hate relationship with Milan despite it being Italy's business center. 
Alitalia has always had its main hub in Rome, but on occasion it decides it wants a bigger presence in Milan. It has 
regularly had service from restricted Linate throughout Italy and to European capitals, but Malpensa has generally 
only served long-haul and Rome for the airline. In reincarnation plan #8,593, Alitalia is now reported to be leaving 
Malpensa entirely[2]. Even if it does remain, it will be with skeleton service to New York and perhaps Tokyo. Up 
until this year, European service from Malpensa was from a mix of low-cost carriers and Qatar-surrogate Air Italy 
(former Meridiana). The biggest carrier is easyJet with about a third of flights. Wizz and Ryanair have been building 
up as as well, smelling opportunity. Air Italy was the only airline that worked with other airlines in a traditional way, 
but it shut down earlier this year. That's where EGO comes in.With all these longer-haul flights coming into 
Malpensa, EGO wants to target codesharing so it can take passengers beyond into smaller Italian towns. Combine 
that connectivity with a local base that prefers Malpensa for one reason or another, and you might be able to fill up 
a 100-seat airplane, at least during the summer.Of course, to succeed with this, EGO would have to be focused and 
smart. That may be difficult. EGO, shockingly, seems a bit distracted.Here's the logo:Ok, great. No problem there. 
But here is how the logo is described on the airline's website[3]:The logo itself tells the story of EGO's DNA: as the 
sun is at the centre of the solar system, around which all the planets rotate, at EGO the focus is the host from which 
all products and services are based. Each circle represents at the same time, a planet, a colour, a quality, a 
personality, each one unique and different.Orange is the sun that represents energy, dynamism, warmth, masculine 
Who the F*&@ Is EGO Airways?
character.Green is the earth, solid, reliable, fluid, more feminine in characterPink is the mutable, creative moon, 
bearer of changeWE RESPECT THE PERSONALITY OF EVERYONE, EVEN OF OUR PLANES Each aircraft 
represents a personality, and like them, it has a different colour and a PERSON NAME.I could go on, but I'd rather 
not at least, not until I can have some of what they're smoking. This seems like an airline that, shall we say, may not 
have the focus to succeed. 'Focus' may not be the best word to use with this airline. After all, the Airways article 
shows a route map with all kinds of short hops criss-crossing the country with focus cities in Parma, Forli, and 
Florence. Parma and Forli are tiny airports with very little service today. Has every other airline missed some golden 
opportunity here? That seems unlikely. So, it appears we have an airline with a solid opportunity to make money out 
of Malpensa in the summer months. That, unfortunately, is not enough to make an airline work on the whole. It will 
need to find ways to live through the winter. Since Alitalia has shrunk and will continue to shrink AND Air Italy has 
gone bust, you'd think there might be an opportunity for a regional feeder airline with smaller aircraft to make a 
niche work. While its not exactly clear what niche might help the airline to strike gold year-round, Alitalia's inability 
— or even unwilligness - to respond is helpful for a start-up. The bigger concern is the growing presence of Wizz, 
Ryanair, easyJet, and Volotea. Those are formidable low-cost carriers, albeit ones that don't generally work well 
with others. Sliding into that narrow niche to fill the shrinking void is going to take focus and a lot of luck. But for 
EGO to succeed, it's going to need to leave ego out of it. [ 1]: https://airwaysmag.com/airlines/ego-airways-is-ready-

US and Europe jostle over Boeing - Airbus dispute
US and Europe jostle over Boeing-Airbus dispute

The United States and the European Union appear to be strengthening their positions ahead of any future 
negotiations to settle a 16-year-old dispute over state subsidies for Boeing and Airbus. US President Donald Trump 
has reacted strongly to a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling that gives the European Commission (EC) the 
green light to impose around USD4 billion annually in counter-tariffs on imported US goods, including Boeing 
planes. The decision found that illegal subsidies to Boeing cost Airbus USD4 billion dollars in lost sales and market 
share annually. 
This follows a similar WTO decision last year greenlighting US tariffs on USD7.5 billion annually on European 
imports, affecting aircraft parts and luxury goods, over state aid support for Airbus. The trans-Atlantic dispute, which 
started in 2004 when the US asked the WTO to rule on Airbus government subsidies, is the longest-running in the 
organisation's 25-year history and is estimated to have cost USD100 million to date. The WTO decision means 
European airlines that import Boeing jets would have to pay tariffs expected to match 15% US border taxes on the 
import of Airbus jets. Boeing's top European customer, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), has called on the manufacturer to 
pay the tariffs and is expected to use this as leverage in negotiations to buy more of the grounded B737-8, 
according to Reuters. Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary earlier this year said the airline was in "advanced 
discussions" with Boeing over an existing order of 135 of the type and a potential follow-up deal for the larger 
version of the aircraft. Meanwhile, with both sides finding themselves in a "check-mate" position, analysts and 
stakeholders on both sides expressed the hope this could finally set the stage for a negotiated settlement between 
the US and Europe, especially at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was wreaking havoc on the global economy 
with the aviation sector being one of the worst-hit. However, in a posturing move, Trump on October 15, 2020, 
warned of a US backlash should the EU go ahead with the levies. "If they strike back, then we'll strike much harder 
than they'll strike. They don't want to do anything. I can tell you that," he told reporters. EU International Trade 
Committee Chairperson, Bernd Lange, called for a negotiated settlement but warned the EU would go ahead with 
the tariffs in the absence of "constructive" US engagement. Lange, in a statement following the ruling, said: "I 
sincerely hope that this decision will work as an incentive to end these disputes through a negotiated settlement. 
That should remain the absolute priority because, in times like these, we should, more than ever, work together and 
not against each other. Therefore I call on both sides to enter into negotiations to reach a long-term agreement on 
civil aircraft subsidies."

upon arrival before the aircraft continued to Tenerife,"a spokesperson for the airline said in a statement to The 
Echo.[1]Speaking to the outlet, another passenger said as soon as the aircraft landed at the Lisbon airport, five 
police officers entered the flight and took the disruptive passenger away. Other passengers cheered when the man 
was being removed from the flight."Passengers cheered as he left the aircraft and someone shouted 'you're not so 
brave now then are you.'The stewards were fantastic and calmly managed the situation, all thanks to them,"the 
unnamed passenger told the outlet.Anthony Ainsworth, who was on the return flight, told the outlet that the cabin 
crew told them about the fight."One of the cabin crew began speaking to one of the customers on the flight. The air 
steward said he then became erratic and there was an altercation and a lot of blood splattered. They calmed the 
situation down and strapped him at the front where he fell asleep. They then had to land the plane in Portugal,"he 
told the outlet. Investigation into the incident was ongoing.The incident comes months after a fight broke 
outonboard a KLM flight[2] from Amsterdam to Ibiza after two men refused to wear masks. The passengers were 
taken into custody after the flight arrived at the destination. In this representational photo, a Ryanair Boeing 737-

Oct 20, 2020( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Another shocking instance of a 
Covidiot on boardwas reported by the Edinburg News, over the weekend. Things turned untoward on Sunday's 
EasyJet Flight from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to Edinburgh, when a lady passenger refused to wear a face mask 
and rebuked those who cautioned her.'Everybody dies, you know that?
!' said the woman as she hollered at the flight attendant, as per the video footage [1]that went viral. 'Every f-king 
body dies, whether it's corona or not! Everybody dies!' she added. That's not all.The lady in question is seen 
coughing on other passengers before being thrown out of the Scotland-bound flight. The footage, which was shot 
by a fellow passenger, sparked fury online, more so as the unidentified woman is shown repeating how 'Everyone 
dies, that's the only thing that's real!' as she's escorted off the flight, much to the annoyance of those around her. 
The lady was asked to 'get a life' and 'wise up' after things began to spiral out of control.The pesky passenger was 
fussy, and made multiple (inconvenient) requests, right from the get-go. 'The EasyJet staff were really good at 
handling it,' said the man to the media outlet.[2] 'They accommodated her when she asked for a row of seats to 
herself, then they politely asked her to wear a mask. She just started shouting,' he added.It was then reported[3] 
that the lady was arrested by airline cops in Belfast for flouting COVID-19 rules and wreaking havoc on the flight. 
While further developments are awaited, an EasyJet spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the report. The 
airline subsequently released a statement: In line with EASA [European Aviation Safety Agency] guidelines, all 
passengers are currently required to bring their own face covering for their flight which must be worn during 
boarding and onboard, except when eating or drinking. We will not tolerate disruptive behavior towards other 
passengers and crew.The novel coronavirus has affected 40.3 million people globally, while the fatality rate 
currently stands at 1.12 million. The world health organization continues to stress how crucial it is for people to put 
on masks, and maintain social distancing to curb the spread of infection. Ground crew are seen parking an Aer

London IWG, which runs Regus shared offices, shot up after Berenberg raised it from "hold" to "buy" and added the 
FTSE 250 group to its top picks among UK midcaps.
"While the company has been materially affected by the pandemic, management has managed the crisis 
exceptionally well and we see a variety of potential positive catalysts in the near term," they said.
Those catalysts were supported by a quicker than expected recovery and its capital-light franchise strategy, the 
analysts said.
Travel groups Tui, easyJet and Ryanair rose after news that the UK regional airline Flybe was being bought out of 
administration with the hope of flying again by early 2021, bringing some cheer to the beaten-down sector.
Cinema reopenings for AMC in New York made waves across the Atlantic as Cineworld climbed.
Boohoo tumbled after it confirmed that PwC would not participate in the competitive tender process to audit the 
online fashion retailer, meaning that it will step down as its auditor after six years.
The accounting firm held concerns about the risks of continuing to work for the online group, which has come under 
scrutiny for suppliers paying workers below the minimum wage. Harry Dempsey

Heathrow Airport launches optional 80 rapid COVID-19 test for flights to

Oct 20, 2020( Proactive Investors: http://www.proactiveinvestors.com Delivered by Newstex)  Heathrow Airport is 
introducing an optional rapid COVID-19 test for passengers flying to Hong Kong and Italy. It is the first such test 
available in the UK, it costs 80 and gives results in an hour. 
They can be taken at terminals 2 and 5 and are faster than the usual NHS PCR ones because they don't need to be 
processed in a laboratory. The aim is to help travellers going to countries that require negative results on arrival, 
such as Hong Kong and Italy. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said on Monday the government has been 
planning a 'test-and-release' system to reduce the quarantine period for people coming from abroad. Too pricey? 
Analysts at Peel Hunt noted Heathrow's tests have a 'prohibitively high' cost, which is also a significant premium to 
the €10 charge for assaystaken on arrival in Italy. It is also more expensive than a short-haul flight within Europe, 
with British Airwaysflights from Heathrow to Milan available from 74 including all taxes, particularly over the off-
season such as the winter. Ryanair is currently selling flights from Stansted to Milan for 7.99 including all taxes. '80 
would considerably more than double the cost of flying and would make it completely uncompetitive if offered to 
lower-cost airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air at the UK airports that they operate from,' analysts noted. 
'We are also concerned that these rapid tests are likely to be significantly less accurate than the PCR tests with 3-
4% false positives.' 'An error rate this high would mean 6-8 passengers were wrongly denied boarding on an 
average short-haul flight, which if they were travelling as part of a family, would result in 6-8 passenger groups not 
being able to travel,' the broker concluded.
