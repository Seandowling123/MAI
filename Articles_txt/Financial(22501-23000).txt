BRITISH Prime Minister David Cameron was spotted using budget airline Ryanair to take his wife on one of its 
cheap flights to Spain for her 40th birthday.
The couple has not had a foreign holiday since Mr Cameron became PM last summer. Plans to enjoy the pleasures 
of five-star Thailand holidays had to be delayed over Christmas for fear of looking insensitive amid high 
unemployment figures.
Now it appears that he has found a way to tackle this publicity problem by taking one of Ryanair's cheap flights to 
Malaga this week, leaving the kids at home with the au pair.
They were spotted by a passenger who took a photo of them in the departure lounge of London Stansted airport. 
Upon arrival in Malaga, the couple took a car to the historic city of Granada where they visited the incredible 14th-
century Moorish fortress and palace called the Alhambra. Ryanair made another impact in the press this week 
when it used the launch of its new cheap flights to Corfu to attack the "high fare airlines and greedy tour operators" 
who they accused of "strangling" the island's holiday industry. The new route begins in June and Ryanair head of 
communications Steve McNamara claimed that it would provide much-needed competition on the island. He said: 
"Greek tourism has been strangled by high fare airlines and greedy tour operators, who have been making out like 
bandits in the absence of a low fares airline to deliver the competition that Greek tourism needs."

Highlight: Irish shares took a second beating today as the euro soared against sterling
Body
Irish shares this week took a second beating as the euro soared against sterling and AIB posted abysmal results.
The pound slid to the weakest level in six months versus the euro as data showed UK inflation unexpectedly slowed 
and retail sales tumbled. Euro rises against the pound erode Irish exporters' competitiveness.
"The trajectory for the pound is lower, certainly versus the euro, and potentially against the dollar," said Kathleen 
Brooks, London-based research director at Forex.com.
After AIB posted annual losses of E10.2bn and said it would cut 2,000 jobs, shares slumped 3c to E0.22. AIB's loss 
compared with E2.3bn a year earlier. Losses from loan impairments increased to E4.5bn and Nama-related losses 
accounted for E8.5bn. Davy's Stephen Lyons said: "Many of the numbers reported today, like capital, deposits and 
loan losses, were already known because of the extensive detail contained in the stress tests. What we really want 
to know is the health of the continuing business and whether the E13.3bn of capital that is to be injected is sufficient 
to help restructure a bank that is fit for purpose." Bank of Ireland fell 2c to E0.25, while Irish Life and Permanent 
gained 1c to E0.15. C&C remained flat at E3.31 as it reported good results for its Magners cider brand. Magners 
on-trade volumes rose 6pc year-on-year in February, driven by Magners Golden Draught (14pc) and better growth 
from packaged/bottled sales (4pc). Pricing was up 6pc year-on-year in line with overall on-trade pricing. Davy 
analyst Barry Gallagher said: "It is encouraging to see Magners back growing and outperforming in the on-trade. 
The market data suggest that Magners overall volume is up 6-7pc for the full year to end-February against a cider 
market up 3pc." Aer Lingus was up 3c to E0.75 while Ryanair added 8c to reach E3.44 by the close. According to 
Bloxham: "A number of global investment banks are suggesting oil could have a hefty element of speculation in it. If 
so, any unwind would be a straight positive for the western world's economy and would be reflected in rising share 
prices among battered oil related sectors such as airlines. Food groups faired well as Kerry gained 46c to E26.76, 
Fyffes was up 1c to E0.44, Glanbia was also up 1c to E4.34 and Greencore rose 3c to E1.2. Elan fell 15c to E5.21 
and United Drug was down 4c to E2.26.

   Apr. 12, 2011 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
US markets
Investors  retreated from stocks, oil and other risky assets as a worsening  nuclear situation in Japan and a 
lackluster start to the U.S.'s  corporate earnings season cast doubt over the global economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 117.53 points, or 0.95%, to  12263.58, while the Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index lost 10.30  points, or 0.78%, at 1314.16, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 26.72  points, or 0.96%, to 
2744.79. Energy stocks led the selling as crude oil  tumbled to $106.25 a barrel and fell further in after hours trading  
after finishing the previous week at $112.79 a barrel, a two year high.

Metals also fell amid the commodities sell-off, with copper, silver and  gold all down 1% or more on the day. Market 
watchers pointed to a number  of reports that dented confidence in the global economy, including a  growth 
downgrade for the U.S. and Japan from the International Monetary  Fund and an assessment of weaker oil demand 
from the International  Energy Agency. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)  also called this week for a pullback in  
commodity prices. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)  dropped 2.3%, while Chevron slid 3.3%.  Alcoa shares slumped 6% 
to lead the Dow losers after the aluminum  producer late Monday reported earnings that topped expectations but  
revenue that fell short of forecasts. The drop-off in commodity prices  underscored a growing concern among 
investors that geopolitical  uncertainties and a weak start to the first-quarter corporate earnings  season could 
presage a weaker economic outlook. Consumer stocks were the  sole bright spot in the markets, with Wal-Mart 
Stores (NYSE:WMT)  rising 1.3% on  hopes that lower costs at the gas pump would boost the big-box  retailer's 
fortunes.
European markets
World Market Overview 04/13/2011
European  stocks dropped sharply Tuesday after Japan raised the severity level of  its nuclear crisis to the same as 
the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the  first-quarter U.S. earnings season got off to a weak start, with  commodity-
related stocks coming under the heaviest pressure. The Stoxx  Europe 600 index closed down 1.7% at 276.24, with 
a 5% fall for miner  Kazakhmys PLC in London and a 2.5% drop for French oil major Total SA (NYSE:TOT)  as  oil 
and metal prices pulled back. The pullback in oil prices helped  lift travel and airline stocks, however, with shares of 
Air France-KLM (NYSE:AKH WS)  (OOTC:AFLYY)   up 2% in Paris and Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY)  up 2.4% in Dublin. Mining stocks  ranked as the biggest decliners in the U.K., helping pull the 
FTSE 100  index down 1.5% to 5,964.47.
Shares of oil giant BP PLC (NYSE:BP)  dropped 2.8%  after the Financial Times reported that the management of 
TNK-BP is  getting ready to sue BP for up to $10 billion over an alleged breach of  their shareholder agreement. In 
Paris, shares of car maker Renault SA  dropped 3.2%. Patrick Pelata stepped down as chief operating officer  late 
Monday after the group made false accusations of corporate  espionage against three other executives. Renault's 
retreat and a 5%  drop in telecom-equipment firm Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE:ALU)  SA contributed to the  French CAC 
40 index losing 1.5% to 3,976.60. In Germany, chip maker  Infineon Technologies AG (OOTC:IFNNY)  fell 4.7% 
and Volkswagen AG was down 1.8%.  Germany's DAX 30 Index fell 1.4% to 7,102.91. Shares of Allied Irish  Banks 
PLC dropped 12%. The bank reported a 2010 loss that widened to  EUR10.23 billion and said it will cut about 2,000 
jobs in 2011 and 2012.  The Irish ISEQ Overall index slipped 0.9% to 2,904.9. Other peripheral  markets were also 
lower, with Portugal's PSI 20 index falling 1.6% to  7,787.1.
Asian markets
Asian  shares fell Tuesday on selling prompted by Japan declaring its nuclear  crisis a match for the Chernobyl 
disaster in severity and after the  International Monetary Fund said global economic growth should slow this  year 
as new risks emerge. Several materials-sector shares tumbled as  prices of crude oil and some other resources 
pulled back after the IMF's  reported its views in its annual World Economic Outlook and Goldman  Sachs withdrew 
bullish recommendations on some commodities. The day's  sell-off gathered pace after Japan raised the crisis level 
at the  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-plant accident to the worst possible level on  an international scale the same level 
as the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl  in Ukraine. More earthquake aftershocks during the day also rattled  investors.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.7% to 9555.26, South  Korea's Kospi slid 1.6% to 2089.40, Taiwan's Taiex gave 
up 1.7% to  8732.59, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 1.3% to 23976.37 and China's  Shanghai Composite 
slipped 0.1% to 3021.37. Some analysts remained  positive on Japanese stocks for their appeal beyond the 
immediate  crisis. A stronger yen and lingering worries over disruption to  production sent most exporters lower, 
with Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM)  losing 0.6% and  Sony (NYSE:SNE)  falling 2.9%. Shares of Tokyo Electric Power, 
the operator of the  stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant, erased early gains on the  elevated nuclear risk level 
and finished down 10%. Several energy and  commodity stocks sank after analysts at Goldman Sachs said that the  
runup in prices over the past several months meant the potential reward  for being long on commodities such as 
crude oil, copper and platinum no  longer justified the risk. Inpex tumbled 5.2% in Tokyo, while PetroChina  fell 
4.9% and Jiangxi Copper lost 3% in Hong Kong. Aluminum-related  companies were also pressured after aluminum 
giant Alcoa reported  disappointing quarterly sales figures Monday. Aluminum Corp. of  China-Chinalco-fell 1.8% 
and United Co. Rusal slipped 0.5% in Hong Kong.
Base metals
Base  metals closed sharply lower on the London Metal Exchange Tuesday, with  copper tumbling more than 2.4% 
amid a broad pullback in world commodity  markets. LME three-month copper ended the session at $9,622 a metric  
ton, down $233 on Monday's PM kerb close. Other base metals were also  down, as were precious metals, crude 
futures and many agricultural  commodities. LME lead closed down a massive 4.4%, while zinc and nickel  tumbled 
World Market Overview 04/13/2011
3% and 3.6% respectively. Crude futures plummeted Tuesday on  signals from a chorus of forecasters that 
elevated oil prices are  hurting fuel demand and weighing on the global economy.
Light, sweet  crude for May delivery fell $3.67, or 3.3%, to settle at $106.25 a  barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, nearly 6% lower than the two  and a half year highs notched  Friday. Brent crude on the ICE futures 
exchange declined $3.06 to  $120.92 a barrel. Oil prices fell after the Paris-based International  Energy Agency said 
there is already evidence that high oil prices are  denting demand. In its own report Tuesday, the Organization of 
Petroleum  Exporting Countries cut its 2011 oil-demand forecast. Separately, Saudi  Arabia cut 500,000 barrels a 
day of recently added production due to  tepid demand. Gold prices were swept lower amid a market-wide move to  
cash-in recent gains. The most actively traded contract, for June  delivery, settled at $1,453.60 a troy ounce, down 
$14.50, or 1%, on the  Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The April-delivery  contract was down 
1%, or $14.50, at $1,452.90 a troy ounce.

EU launches air passenger law overhaul AVIATION

THE EUROPEAN Union yesterday laid out plans to shake up airline passenger compensation laws, after carriers 
faced massive bills from the Icelandic ash cloud and snow storms.
The EU will discuss wide-reaching changes with aviation stakeholders and present a new law in 2012, European 
Commission vice-president Siim Kallas said yesterday.
The review of Regulation 261 will look at who should shoulder the cost of "extraordinary circumstances" such as 
natural disasters that disrupt air travel - which could mean airports like Heathrow could be forced to pay some costs 
for events like last Christmas's snow chaos.
The EU will also look at how much compensation should be paid to passengers if their flights are cancelled or 
delayed, as well as examining rules on lost luggage and rescheduled flights.
"The next big push will be to step up enforcement - it is not enough to have rights on paper, they must be applied 
on the ground," said Kallas in a statement."[W]e cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the lessons learnt from what 
passengers and industry suffered during the 2010 ash crisis and snow."
The EU said the regulation needs to be strengthened and used in a uniform way across the bloc, and aims to 
produce extra guidelines by the end of the year.
Ryanair called Regulation 261 "unfair" when it introduced a (EURO)2 (£1.77) per passenger levy two weeks ago to 
help pay for compensation doled out to customers caught up in uncontrollable events.
EU launches air passenger law overhaul AVIATION
FAST FACTS | REGULATION 261 ? Under rules introduced in the EU in 2005, passengers are granted rights, such 
as food and shelter if a flight is delayed beyond four hours. ? But uncertainty in the law has caused fighting between 
airlines, customers and airports.

Airlines may no longer face open-ended obligations to feed and lodge stranded passengers after the European 
Commission acknowledged the industry's complaints and said it would revise a key piece of legislation.
Siim Kallas , Europe's transport commissioner, announced on Monday that he would examine ways to limit airlines' 
responsibility to care for stranded travellers as part of a broader revision of passenger rights legislation.
The issue of caring for stranded passengers moved to the top of the agenda during last year's volcanic ash crisis , 
in which governments grounded thousands of flights across Europe for safety reasons.
Under the EU's six-year-old passenger rights law, airlines are required to feed and house passengers in Europe 
until they can be rebooked on other flights. The law was passed to protect consumers amid suspicions that airlines 
were delaying or cancelling partially full flights in order to save money.
But the airlines complained that it was misapplied during the ash cloud crisis - forcing them to shoulder the burden 
for an unforeseen natural disaster that created a week-long public emergency.
They raised similar arguments in December after wintry weather and shortages of de-icing fluid also forced 
widespread flight cancellations.
Ryanair, which has been a strong critic of the EU's passenger right law, said any additional reform of the rules 
"must not impose further unreasonable costs to airlines since these will simply get passed on to passengers in the 
form of higher fares".
Ryanair last week introduced a EUR2 surcharge to offset the EUR100m in expenses it claims to have suffered 
during the past year related to the passenger rights law.
Stephen McNamara, of Ryanair, said at the time: "It is clearly unfair that airlines are obliged to provide meals and 
accommodation for passengers - for days and weeks in some cases - simply because governments close their 
airspace, or air traffic controllers walk off the job, or incompetent airports fail to clear their runways of snow."
Airlines' duty to stranded travellers faces curb
In a review of the law published on Monday, Mr Kallas effectively agreed. He said that the commission would 
examine "limitation of liability" in exceptional circumstances and "compensation thresholds" when it proposes a 
revision to the law in 2012.
A commission official declined to comment on the specific remedies but acknowledged that policymakers had come 
to share the airlines' view that the legislation was never intended to cope with an extended closure of European 
skies.
A key issue to work out, this person said, was at what point the responsibility would pass from the airlines to 
governments.

Only days after Oliver Letwin , David Cameron's policy chief, was accused of saying that "he did not want to see 
more families in Sheffield able to afford cheap holidays", the prime minister and his wife were pictured flying by 
Ryanair from Stansted on a cheap holiday to Spain.
If this were New Labour, one might suspect a swift set-up. Unlikely: surely only love could have got the prime 
minister on the plane to Granada straight after a 36-hour trip to Pakistan. And they were not flying from Robin Hood 
(Doncaster Sheffield) Airport.
Mind you, if the government's policy against airport expansion in south-east England has the effect many predict, 
they soon will be.

Four now two much for Virgin
Remember George Orwell's Animal Farm, where the commandment "Four legs good; two legs bad" was quietly 
forgotten when the pigs started behaving like humans?
Has Sir Richard Branson suffered a similar convenient lapse of memory? Back at Farnborough in 2002, Virgin 
Atlantic was proudly showing off its latest A340-600 with the slogan "4 engines 4 long haul" on the nacelle. The not-
so-subtle message was partly a dig at arch-rival British Airways' largely two-engined widebody fleet with Virgin even 
producing "research" that showed that passengers would "go out of their way" to fly with three spare engines.
Fast forward almost a decade of soaring fuel prices and Virgin is hailing its first A330-300, which has just gone into 
service, as an airliner that is 15% more efficient per seat over its gas-guzzling bigger sister and will help "deliver the 
carrier's commitment to flying a lower carbon fleet".
Oh well, wouldn't be the first virgin that's rewritten the past.
Too early for ski-ing
While enjoying a snowy break in the Alps, one of our scribblers snapped this abrupt stop after a descent through 
spectacular Alpine landscape by a Piper Lance II (reg N-220BK) at Courchevel's altiport on 20 March. The pilot 
forgot a crucial item on the before-landing checklist and arrived with the wheels up on the famous 18.5% sloped 
runway. Both pilot and passenger walked away uninjured, but in all likelihood had to leave the illustrious French 
resort by less exclusive ground-based transport.
Childish prank
Some great aviation April Fools, including our own BA royal wedding commemorative tails, but we're still trying to 
work out if the Ryanair 1 April release about child-free flights from October (in response to a Europe-wide survey of 
customers who want to travel free of other people's brats) was one of them.
No Headline In Original
The trouble is, it's a lot more sensible than half the hot air that passes for Ryanair press announcements.
Whining, seeking attention, being rude and throwing tantrums when they don't get their own way: Ryanair, don't you 
love them?
Fun times at Ford
Still the money flies in for former Boeing Commercial Airplanes boss Alan Mulally who has been awarded a $26.5 
million salary by his employer Ford on top of $56.5 million he received recently for turning the formerly ailing car 
maker around.
At this rate, he won't just be buying back the business jet Ford sold in the midst of the Detroit bail-out scandal in 
2008, but his own personal president-for-life style 747-8I bling palace.

Ianchored CNBC's coverage of the European Central Bank (ECB) Rate Decision Special show last week. This 
involved saying: "Welcome to CNBC. Jean-Claude Trichet is speaking. Let's listen in," then tweeting snippets of the 
proceedings to my Twitter followers, of whom there are literally dozens, including several who think I'm the librarian 
in Massachusetts who happens to share my name.
This is a simple task and I'm faintly embarrassed to admit I get paid to do it. The tougher element is deciphering 
what the devil Trichet is saying. He did say "monitor very closely", but he did not make any mention of being 
"vigilant". Apparently that is code for the ECB might raise rates the month after next.Then Trichet produced a white 
hanky and started dabbing at his nose. My twittersphere friends and I (under the Twitter handle @BeccyMeehan) 
speculated this might be a further layer of code, but it turned out the poor chap does actually have a cold.
Speaking of unfathomable codes, I recently went to RBS to interview chief executive Stephen Hester about his 
results. I was handed a presentation from which I learned "good jaws drive improved profitability".
Hmmm. I thought I was just being dim, until later that day I interviewed a Very Successful City Big Cheese, who 
shall remain nameless.
As he flicked through the slides, he turned to me and said: "I've no idea what all this jaws stuff is about - I don't 
believe anyone can make head nor tail of this lot, there's just so much info."
I'm all for full disclosure, but imagine a world in which we all just speak like normal human beings, get to the point 
and then shut up.
Which brings me back to Twitter.
Businesses should take a lesson from Twitter
Not necessarily the natural habitat of normal human beings, but nevertheless, the most important messages might 
benefit from being pared down into 140 characters.
For instance, Jean-Claude Tweet-chet (sorry) could post: "Inflation is still rising. We might raise rates again, but 
we're not sure. We're happy Portugal asked for help. I have a cold today."
Ryanair's chief Michael O'Leary might also be well-suited to the platform. This wonderful quote from him is clear in 
meaning and would definitely fit into a tweet: "You're not getting a refund so **** off."

Highlight: Racing with the FT: little can distract Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary from his horse at the Cheltenham 
races. By Pilita Clark
Body
Of all the words used to describe Michael O'Leary, the irascible boss of Ireland's Ryanair budget airline, one you 
don't hear too often is "fast". But by God he can be quick when he wants to be. Here at the Cheltenham races, in 
the heart of England's Cotswolds, he is fairly pelting through the crowd to the owners' and trainers' enclosure, 
where one of the 50-odd racehorses he has acquired over the last decade, Mr Cracker, is getting ready for the first 
race of the day.
The pace is striking for a man of average build with a sedentary job a few days from his 50th birthday. It is as if he 
is being chased by a gang of livid Ryanair passengers, of which there rarely seems a shortage. In fact, only two 
people are puffing along behind him: an FT photographer and me. Eventually he stops to let us catch up. "You have 
to be quick," he says semi-apologetically. "Otherwise every gobshite is stopping you to ask, 'What tips have you got 
for us today?'"
At last we make it to the enclosure. No gobshites in here. Just a nervy throng of skittish horses, anxious trainers 
and watchful owners, chatting quietly as their jockeys head out on to one of Europe's most famous racetracks.
Cheltenham is not like Royal Ascot. As O'Leary likes to say, the crowd here doesn't quaff. It slugs. This is the 
mecca of national hunt or jump racing. And because it is dominated by Irish and British-trained horses, there is a 
cheerful undertone of Anglo-Hibernian rivalry. Especially when an Irish horse wins, as one is doing now up on the 
huge video screen O'Leary is watching.
Unfortunately for him, it isn't Mr Cracker. But it is Irish and today is St Patrick's Day, and a huge cheer erupts from 
outside the enclosure. "If you can't enjoy this, you should never go racing," says O'Leary, gazing happily at a crowd 
dotted with the occasional man dressed as a leprechaun in green and orange tights. "This is as good as it gets."
The Irish are on an enormous roll this week. Their horses won six out of seven races the day before. Two were from 
O'Leary's Gigginstown House Stud, part of his estate near the town of Mullingar, west of Dublin. Mullingar is central 
All bets are on
to his attachment to horse racing. The maroon and white that his jockeys wear come from the county football team. 
He grew up on a farm there and his parents still live close by.
The morning's Racing Post reports that after one of O'Leary's wins the previous day, he tearfully paid tribute to his 
father, Ted, who used to own racehorses himself but is now being treated for cancer. "I wouldn't be here if he hadn't 
bred it into me," O'Leary told the paper. He looks more cheerful today as he explains how his father "had a couple 
of good horses", but none that made it to Cheltenham. O'Leary might not have either if it weren't for his brother, 
Eddie bustling around nearby.
O'Leary says the two of them, along with their three sisters and brother, were all packed off to riding school at the 
age of four. O'Leary fell off on about day two and decided that was enough. "I was bright. I realised I could get hurt 
doing this, so I stopped straight away." But Eddie was a "very good rider, did show jumping, all that kind of stuff", 
and now manages the Gigginstown operation. "He runs the stud, buys all the horses, does all that," says O'Leary. "I 
just write the cheques. We have an appropriate division of labour!"
O'Leary is worth millions thanks to his 3.7 per cent stake in Ryanair, which is just as well since one of his winners 
yesterday, First Lieutenant, cost EUR255,000, the most O'Leary says he has ever paid for a horse. It is barely a 
decade since O'Leary bought his first horse, Tuco, which won several races before getting killed in an Irish jumps 
race. "When he got killed we went out and bought another one that week to replace him," O'Leary says matter-of-
factly. The new horse was War of Attrition, which won the Cheltenham gold cup, the Wimbledon of jump racing, in 
2006.
O'Leary once said that "War", as the retired horse is now affectionately known, had given him the best days of his 
life, apart from the birth of his children. This got him into trouble at home, he says with a mock scowl. "My wife 
asked me, 'What about our wedding day?' I said, 'No, that was a bloody nightmare.' Wonderful result, just a pain in 
the arse of a day."
O'Leary can sound sweeter when he talks about his horses. "They're lovely animals," he says. "They're like 
humans: you can't tell which one is going to be a winner from looking at them. Flat racing is much more driven by 
pedigree, whereas with jump racing, almost every top jumps horse isn't related to anything."
They also bring him to a world far from the 24/7 mayhem of running a budget airline. Outside, O'Leary may be the 
voluble boss of Ryanair, forever threatening to charge fat passengers extra when he isn't trying to put coin locks on 
plane toilets. But in here, he is the man. "Hello Michael!" people call. "Well done, Michael!" Everyone wants a chat. 
Trainers. Other owners. Racecourse bosses. Charlie McCreevy, Ireland's former finance minister (now a Ryanair 
board member).
O'Leary doesn't seem to be here to socialise, though: in the winner's enclosure a bit later, we are standing a short 
half-head away from Princess Anne and Zara Phillips. O'Leary doesn't talk to either, not even when Princess Anne 
passes inches from his nose. "Isn't that Princess Anne?" I ask. "Ah yes, she's usually here," he says nonchalantly. 
Finally, it is time for one of the day's biggest races, the Ryanair Chase, which carries a generous prize of £260,000.
O'Leary insists he would sponsor Cheltenham even if he didn't love racing. "We carry an awful lot of people over 
here every year for the races, it's a very good association for us," he says.
But when Ryanair is a sponsor, you need to be ready for a few surprises. Last year, as O'Leary was collecting a 
trophy, a heckler yelled: "Charge him a quid for picking it up!" Another asked how much it would cost him in "excess 
baggage". Today, during the Ryanair Chase, a man gets on to the racetrack to protest against Ryanair's treatment 
of its cabin crew. He is promptly carted away. Afterwards, O'Leary brushes off the incident. "If some idiot wants to 
try and make some publicity for himself, let him."
And then it's time for the next race. O'Leary is gone, tearing off to see his horse in action, leaving the rest of us to 
stand and watch his rapidly disappearing back.

LIKE Nice, Cannes or St Tropez, it's hard to find a slice of Tuscany that's escaped the money and appetites of the 
international set. So for those craving a home in a still-authentic slice of Italy, with budgets below those of the global 
elite, Umbria is the smart choice.
Paul Belcher, director of Ultissimo, a property agent selling in Umbria, Como and Tuscany, maintains that Umbria 
offers something for a different type of buyer - those with families and those seeking a "retreat" rather than a scene. 
Crucially, it's less expensive than Tuscany. Andrew Hawkins, of Chesterton Humberts, says it's roughly 5-10 per 
cent cheaper. But Belcher insists properties are closer to around 20 to 30 per cent less. Either way, Umbria 
represents a sturdy investment, as prime Western Europe has proved relatively resilient throughout the rocky past 
few years. That said, according to Hawkins, the Italian market has stagnated somewhat and with prices certain to 
begin climbing again, it's a good time to buy. "There's a window of opportunity now," he says. "Nobody knows how 
fast or when the market will grow - but it will do."
Umbria's rugged beauty is preserved from the ravages of development in good part because of regulations. "In 
Tuscany there are some places where you wouldn't know you were in Italy - what with new builds and foreign 
voices everywhere," Belcher says. In Umbria you can't add on to properties, you can only restore them. There are 
strict regulations on maintaining original roof lines and colours and window sizes - although you can modernise 
inside unfettered.
Previously Umbrian farmers lived among their fields - but with the advent of cars, many people abandoned their 
rural dwellings and headed towards the towns and cities - the kids certainly didn't want to be stuck out in rural

farmhouses. This left a good deal of derelict farmhouses that have been snapped up and renovated by savvy 
foreign buyers. Now, good stock is harder to come by. But - say both Hawkins and Belcher - if you take care, are 
thoughtful and have your finances ready, you can find a well-placed gem. Umbria is "the epicentre of Renaissance 
Italy" - two hours from Florence, Sienna, Rome and even closer to Perugia. Ryanair flies regularly to Perugia.

ANYONE who thinks a small trolley case is suitable hand luggage for a weekend away or a business trip is 
suffering a failure of imagination. The only thing in an airport less stylish than a Ryanair boarding queue is a 
businessman wheeling around a tiny overnight case - at least pick it up, you weed.
Alternatively, recognise the fact that beautiful holdalls and cary-on bags, made in fine leathers, represent an English 
tradition that's at the epicentre of classy traveling. The latest line from Mayfair luxury store William & Son is a case 
in point - we particularly like the roomy holdall in striking yellow leather pictured far right.

The ISEQ dipped in to the red this morning as investors await the outcome of a crucial meeting of the ECB's policy 
committee on interest rates and after Portugal joined Ireland and Greece in seeking a bailout.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 9.38 points to 2,972.04.
Last night, Portuguese prime minister, Jose Socrates, indicated that the government has made a request for 
financial aid to the EU Commission. Initial reports indicate that the total package sought by the Portuguese 
government may be around E75bn, a little below the E85bn package agreed for Ireland in late 2010. The 
announcements last night followed an auction of Portuguese bonds where yields rose to 5.9pc on one-year 
maturities. This rate is more than Germany pays on 30-year bonds.
The European Central Bank is poised to raise interest rates from a record low 1.0pc today and more is likely to 
follow but, fearful of heaping more pain on the euro zone's stragglers, it will give few clues about when the next 
move will come. ECB policymakers have been out in force in recent weeks flagging a rise that will be their first since 
July 2008. All but four of 80 economists polled last week expected it to raise rates by 25 basis points. Shares in 
Bank of Ireland were flat at E0.31, Irish Life and Permanent was also unmoved at E0.12 and AIB dipped 1c to 
E0.29. Aer Lingus' booked passenger numbers in March 2011 showed a drop of 8.4pc when compared to March 
2010 with 716,000 booked passengers in total. Short haul booked passengers were 653,000, a decrease of 8.4pc 
on March 2010 while long haul booked passengers in March 2011 were 63,000, a decrease of 8.7pc on March 
2010. Aer Lingus said that the year-on-year comparison of booked passenger numbers is impacted by the timing of 
the Easter holiday period, which commenced in the last week of March in 2010. This year, Easter occurs in late 
April. Shares in the former flag carrier fell 3c to E0.74 while Ryanair stocks dipped 1c to E3.39. There were strong 
US/Europe cement production volumes in Q1 2011 (not just due to weather), particularly in Germany, Poland and 
Russia. Volumes remain strong in emerging markets over the past six months - Brazil +13pc, Argentina +16pc. In

most countries where volumes have recovered, price increases are being achieved (e.g. prices are up strongly in 
India, China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil). "April 1st price increases are vital (e.g. US/Germany) - we are optimistic

The ISEQ dipped in to the red this morning as investors await the outcome of a crucial meeting of the ECB's policy 
committee on interest rates and after Portugal joined Ireland and Greece in seeking a bailout.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 9.38 points to 2,972.04.
Last night, Portuguese prime minister, Jose Socrates, indicated that the government has made a request for 
financial aid to the EU Commission. Initial reports indicate that the total package sought by the Portuguese 
government may be around E75bn, a little below the E85bn package agreed for Ireland in late 2010. The 
announcements last night followed an auction of Portuguese bonds where yields rose to 5.9pc on one-year 
maturities. This rate is more than Germany pays on 30-year bonds.
The European Central Bank is poised to raise interest rates from a record low 1.0pc today and more is likely to 
follow but, fearful of heaping more pain on the euro zone's stragglers, it will give few clues about when the next 
move will come. ECB policymakers have been out in force in recent weeks flagging a rise that will be their first since 
July 2008. All but four of 80 economists polled last week expected it to raise rates by 25 basis points. Shares in 
Bank of Ireland were flat at E0.31, Irish Life and Permanent was also unmoved at E0.12 and AIB dipped 1c to 
E0.29. Aer Lingus' booked passenger numbers in March 2011 showed a drop of 8.4pc when compared to March 
2010 with 716,000 booked passengers in total. Short haul booked passengers were 653,000, a decrease of 8.4pc 
on March 2010 while long haul booked passengers in March 2011 were 63,000, a decrease of 8.7pc on March 
2010. Aer Lingus said that the year-on-year comparison of booked passenger numbers is impacted by the timing of 
the Easter holiday period, which commenced in the last week of March in 2010. This year, Easter occurs in late 
April. Shares in the former flag carrier fell 3c to E0.74 while Ryanair stocks dipped 1c to E3.39. There were strong 
US/Europe cement production volumes in Q1 2011 (not just due to weather), particularly in Germany, Poland and 
Russia. Volumes remain strong in emerging markets over the past six months - Brazil +13pc, Argentina +16pc. In

most countries where volumes have recovered, price increases are being achieved (e.g. prices are up strongly in 
India, China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil). "April 1st price increases are vital (e.g. US/Germany) - we are optimistic

EasyJet March Load Factor Falls; Passenger Numbers Rise - Update
EasyJet March Load Factor Falls; Passenger Numbers Rise - Update
RTT News (United States)

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) on Wednesday reported a drop in load factor for the month of 
March, while passenger numbers increased from last year.
Load factor for the month declined 0.6 percentage points to 86.9 percent from last year's 87.5 percent. Load factor 
represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers.
Passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, increased 11.9 percent to 4.44 million.
The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether or not the passenger turns up as 
easyJet is a no-refund airline. When a flight has departed a no-show customer is generally not entitled to change 
flights or seek a refund. Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for business 
travel.
In February, the company had reported a 13.1 percent growth in passengers and 1.1 percentage point increase in 
load factor.
On a rolling 12 months basis, load factor rose 0.7 percentage points to 87.1 percent, while passengers improved 
8.5 percent to 51.23 million.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L ) said Monday that its load factor was unchanged at 79 
percent in March, while passengers grew 8 percent to 5.7 million.
EZJ.L closed Tuesday's regular trade at 325.80 pence, down 0.80 pence or 0.24 percent, on 1.62 million shares.

The ISEQ dipped in to the red for the first time in three days yesterday as investors took profits and as inflation 
fears took hold across the eurozone and in Britain.
The index fell 4.03 points to 2,948.25.
European shares traded flat in choppy trade with inflation concerns intensifying as crude prices hovered around two 
and a half year highs, prompting investors to pause for breath following a three-week rally. The pan-European 
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was flat at 1,141.75 points in a choppy session, with the index having gained 
around 7 percent since hitting three and a half month lows in mid-March. Brent crude prices held at around dollar 
121 a barrel on geopolitical uncertainties in parts of the Middle East and Africa, stoking inflation concerns ahead of 
a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting later this week, when it is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points. "It 
(the strong crude price) is the reason why the ECB is expected to hike rates this week. The worry is whether it's 
going to be generally an influence on higher interest rates," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB 
Stockbrokers in Dublin.
At home and following last week's strong manufacturing purchasing managers index, including the highest reading 
for manufacturing employment since 2000, today's services PMI paints a less optimistic picture, suggesting only a 
marginal rate of expansion on the month in that sector. Together with yesterday's exchequer returns release, the 
PMI numbers indicate that domestic demand remains weak with the Irish economy is still reliant on the export 
sector to drive recovery. Shares in Ryanair fell 2c to E3.32. Ryanair ended its financial year with a robust set of 
traffic figures: March growth of 8pc year-on-year (yoy) on flat loads of 79pc was in line with our expectations. 
Ryanair delivered 73.5m passengers during the fiscal year, including 1.45m passengers whose flights were 
cancelled due to ash-cloud-related disruption in April/May. Ryanair will report full-year results on May 23rd with 
guidance at the upper end of the E380-400m net profit range, pre-exceptionals. It said it has cut its Alicante 
ISEQ dips in to negative territory; ISEQ Dips
services by 80pc over what it claims are unnecessary charges. Shares in Aer Lingus dipped 1c to E0.73. Reports 
from Daft.ie and Myhome.ie confirm that Irish house prices continued their steady decline in Q1. The latest Daft 
survey shows that asking prices fell by a further 3.1pc in Q1, bringing the total decline in asking prices since the 
market peak to 43pc. Daft suggests that the fall in prices may be beginning to slow, but highlights 'a new set of 
problems' that may be on the way. These include rising interest rates, the risk that at some point there could be a 
surge in repossessions and the risk of 'strategic default'. Shares in CRH fell 21c to E16.32, Kingspan was down 7c 
to E6.38 and Grafton climbed 1c to E3.43. HMV has issued a profit warning. "However, it is hard to take any read 
across for DCC Sercom's retail business in the UK given the company specific issues facing HMV at present and 
shifts in market share across products and channels," said Goodbody's. Shares in DCC fell 33c to E2.74.

Ryanair is to slash its services at Alicante Airport in Spain by 80pc this coming Winter with the loss of over 2,000 
jobs over what it says is the airport's attempt to force the Irish airline to use airbridges.
It said it does not need airbridges and that this is just a way by which the airport authority can impose additional 
charges, with Ryanair saying it will cost it E2m a year extra.
"Ryanair has been operating at Alicante Airport for over five years without the use of airbridges and this decision by 
AENA Alicante is an abuse of its monopoly which increases Ryanair's handling costs by over E2m p.a. Ryanair has 
submitted a formal complaint about this monopoly abuse by AENA Alicante to both the Spanish Government and 
the European Commission," it said.
Ryanair will cut the number of aircraft at the airport from 11 to just 2 and cut the routes to and from Alicante from 62 
to 31. It will cut the number of flights from 600 to less than 200 and the number of passengers from 4 million to 1.5 
million with the loss of over 2,000 jobs, including hotel and support jobs. "It is time that the AENA monopoly airports 
in Spain stopped abusing their dominant position to force airlines like Ryanair to use unnecessary (airbridge) 
facilities which we neither want, nor are willing to pay for. Alicante Airport has opened up a new terminal building 
which was not needed, and to pay for it, Alicante expects efficient airlines like Ryanair to now use the same 
inefficient and high cost airbridges that other high fare flag carrier airlines prefer to use," said chief executive, 
Michael O'Leary. "This abusive behaviour by AENA Alicante will now mean that the airport loses over E30m p.a. in 
revenues, more than 2.5m passengers and over 2,000 jobs, as Ryanair's based aircraft and flights are cut by up to 
80pc from October 2011. Ryanair remains committed to serving Alicante Airport, and even with 1.5m passengers 
and 31 routes, will continue to be the largest airline at Alicante. However, AENA Alicante must understand that 
Ryanair is an efficient, low cost carrier, and we have many other low cost airport alternatives across Europe if 
Ryanair cuts Alicante base on airbridges; Ryanair Cuts
Alicante doesn't want to provide low cost facilities. We are not going to be bullied by an abusive airport monopoly,

Brussels veteran appointed to board
Retailer aims at European growth
Body
Charlie McCreevy, the former European Union internal markets commissioner, has joined the board of Sports 
Direct, the retailer founded by Mike Ashley, owner of Newcastle United football club.
The UK's biggest sporting goods retailer by market share said on Friday the former Irish government minister had 
joined as a non-executive director with immediate effect.
He replaces Malcolm Dalgleish, who stepped down from the board in September.
Mr McCreevy, 61, who also serves on the board of Ryanair, the budget airline, had been minister for finance and 
minister for tourism and trade in the Irish Republic.
His experience within the EU is expected to assist Sports Direct in its efforts to expand further into continental 
Europe.
The group has retail interests in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Cyprus and Ireland.
Peter Smedley, retail analyst at Charles Stanley, said: "We know that Sports Direct has material ambitions in 
Europe, which have effectively remained in their infancy since its IPO [in February 2007]. This move will add weight 
to the board."
Keith Hellawell, nonexecutive chairman of Sports Direct, on Friday said of Mr McCreevy: "We are pleased to 
welcome Charles to the board.
McCreevy joins Sports Direct
"His experience in business and as European commissioner for internal markets and services will be a great asset 
to Sports Direct."
As both Irish finance minister and EU commissioner, Mr McCreevy was linked to the era of light-touch regulation, 
though he also championed the extension of copyright for record labels and the introduction of software patents to 
the EU. He also gained notoriety for stating before Ireland's failed 2008 referendum on the Lisbon treaty that he had 
not read the entire document , adding that he doubted any sane person would do so.
Following his departure from the European Commission last year, Mr McCreevy joined the board of a   new banking 
venture , later named NBNK Investments and admitted to Aim.
The venture was headed by high-profile business figures including Sir David Walker, Lord Levene and Lord McFall, 
and targeted government-backed assets such as Northern Rock and a portfolio of Lloyds Banking Group branches.
But in October, Mr McCreevy was forced to step down as a director of NBNK Investments after concerns were 
raised about possible breaches of EU conflict of interest rules, due to his former position as a commissioner.
Sports Direct shares rose 2.2p to close at 183.7p on Friday.

separate airlines.
Body
Lessor RBS Aviation Capital has delivered seven 737-800s to five carriers: Nordstar Airlines, Okay Airways, Izmir 
Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, and Virgin Blue Airlines.
Last month, Nordstar Airlines took delivery of the first of two 737-800s, while privately-owned Chinese carrier, Okay 
Airways, took delivery of the second and third of three 737-800s. All three 2004-vintage aircraft were previously 
leased to Ryanair.
During March and April, Turkish domestic carrier, Izmir Airlines, took delivery of two 2009-vintage 737-800s. Turkish 
low-cost-carrier, Pegasus Airlines, also took delivery of a 2009-vintage 737-800 in February. The aircraft were 
previously operated by Air Berlin.
At the beginning of February RBS Aviation Capital delivered a new 737-800 from its direct order stream to 
Australian carrier, Virgin Blue.
The Dublin-based lessor announced an order for 43 737-800s last July - five have delivered to date.
RBS Aviation Capital also delivered two 2001-vintage CRJ200s on finance lease to Tartarstan carrier, AK Bars 
Aero, in March.
The lessor, which sold 12 aircraft in November and December last year, sold a 1996-vintage 747-400 to Israeli 
flagcarrier, El Al, in February. The ex-Singapore airlines jumbo jet was last operated by Spanish carrier, Pullmantur.
RBS Aviation Capital says that it has profitably sold 170 commercial aircraft worth about $6.4 billion over the past 
seven years. The lessor's aircraft portfolio is worth about $8 billion.

The main Dublin shares index tipped back in to negative territory after the keenly awaited bank stress tests showed 
that E24 billion more is needed to put what's left of the Irish financial system back on a path to normality.
The ISEQ fell 11.93 points to 2,874.71.
Shares in all of the listed banks are in suspension until tomorrow. Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, has 
revealed that banking sector will require a further E24 billion recapitalisation, pushing the total cost of bailing out the 
banks to E70 billion. The figure was determined by the Central Bank's long-awaited stress tests on Bank of Ireland, 
Allied Irish Banks, Irish Life and Permanent and the EBS. The Central Bank says that AIB will need E13.3 billion, 
Bank of Ireland E5.2 billion, EBS E1.5 billion and Irish Life and Permanent E4 billion. Bank of Ireland's new needs 
will make it harder for it to stay out of majority State ownership, analysts say. Central Bank governor Patrick 
Honohan said the intensive nature of the tests were designed to respond to "market scepticism" about the Irish 
banks. He said a pre-requisite for banks to return to normal is that they have capital to meet even the markets 
"gloomy prognostications". "This is what we regard as an adverse and unlikely scenario but we don't expect it to be 
this bad," Prof Honohan said.

Environment to be at heart of aviation policy rethink

Body
A change in night flight times and a range of other aircraft noise measures will be considered as part of the 
government's protracted efforts to forge a fresh aviation policy, it emerged on Wednesday.
But the most striking aspect of a preliminary consultation document on the new policy is its repeated emphasis on 
the need for the aviation industry to face up to the challenges of climate change.
"We are not anti-aviation, we are anti-carbon," said Philip Hammond, transport secretary, explaining the new policy 
would replace a "fundamentally out-of-date" 2003 white paper from the previous Labour government, which had 
"got the balance wrong".
"It failed to adapt its policies to the fact that climate change has become one of the gravest threats we face," he 
said.
The document will seek views by September 30 on ideas such as to change night flight regimes to give more 
respite to residents, and to set a "noise envelope" in which aviation could increase as noise per aircraft was 
reduced.
The coalition government's relations with aviation groups have been mixed since it made a ban on new runways 
around London one of its first policy announcements after last year's election.
Business and aviation groups reacted with a mix of sour resignation and polite dismissal to the so-called scoping 
document Mr Hammond published, which acknowledges "the strong view" of some business leaders about the 
need for extra airport capacity. However, it says: "We want a successful and sustainable UK aviation sector, but we 
need to acknowledge the environmental constraints and explore how aviation can address these challenges in 
order to allow aviation growth to occur."
Environment to be at heart of aviation policy rethink
David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: "The document fails to set out a clear 
plan as to how we can build our aviation capacity in the months and years ahead." Therefore, he warned, the UK's 
growth and prosperity could end up being damaged.
Ian Godden, chairman of the ADS aerospace and defence industries trade group, warned the UK would miss out on 
critical economic benefits "if it [were to be] distracted by the fog of environmentalism and nimbyism from the 
opponents of flying".
Stewart Wingate, Gatwick airport's chief executive, urged the government not to forget that the aviation industry 
generates more than £12bn each year and keeps more than 500,000 people in jobs.
In other moves on Wednesday, the Competition Commission confirmed a 2009 ruling that BAA, Heathrow's owner, 
would have to sell Stansted and either Edinburgh or Gatwick airports. Stansted should be sold first, it said, then one 
of the other Scottish airports after a "small overlap".
Separately, Ryanair announced it was to bring in a EUR2 levy per passenger for all bookings made from Monday 
April 4 to cover costs of EU requirements to cover flight cancellations and delays.
Rival airline Flybe said: "This is a smokescreen to cover their spiralling fuel costs and is a very thinly disguised fuel 
surcharge."

THE Competition Commission yesterday again ruled that BAA should sell Stansted and either its Edinburgh or 
Glasgow airports, in a decision that is sure to spark a bidding war for the airports.
The decision backs one made in March 2009 which BAA successfully appealed on a technicality, but the court of 
appeal yesterday reinstated its original ruling.
BAA, which owns Heathrow, already sold Gatwick in October 2009 for £15bn to investment fund Global 
Infrastructure Partners.
Competition Commission chairman Peter Freeman said: "We remain convinced that the original decision to require 
BAA to divest three airports is the right one for passengers and airlines."
But BAA argued against the ruling saying: "There has been a material change in circumstances" since the 
Commission's report was published in March 2009.
The news about the forced sales came on a bad day for BAA, which is owned by Spanish infrastructure company 
Ferrovial.
Earlier, a confidential international table rating the aviation industry had ranked Heathrow 99 in a league table of the 
world's main airports, behind the likes of hubs in Calcutta, Dublin and Humberside.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, welcomed the Commission's decision.
It said: "Today is a great day for low fares and competition and a bad day for monopolies."
BAA must sell two airports
The airline added: "We welcome the Competition Commission's decision to proceed with the break-up of the BAA 
airport monopoly, and eagerly await the sale of Stansted and Glasgow airports."

Irish shares have made gains for second day this morning, despite market nervousness about the results of bank 
stress tests, due out later today.
Shares of both AIB and Bank of Ireland have been suspected for the day, in the words of the Central Bank, to 
"avoid the possibility of a disorderly market due to the circulation of information or rumours".
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 24.71 points ahead a short time ago at 2,911.35.
DCC was up 9c to 2249, with Ryanair ahead by 3c to 335 and Smurfit Kappa lifting by 11c to 902. It was not all 
upward movement, however. CRH is flat in 1650, with Elan down 7c to 485 and Kerry Group slipping by 8c to 2655.

Ryanair to impose new anti-EU fee on all tickets
Ryanair to impose new anti-EU fee on all tickets

Body
Ryanair, the airline notorious for its array of extra charges, has just launched an unavoidable new fee that will add 
(EURO)2 ($2.80) to every one-way ticket.
Europe's biggest budget carrier announced Wednesday that its new "EU261 levy" has been designed to 
compensate the airline for European consumer laws that hold airlines, rather than airports or governments, liable for 
stranded customers' food and hotel costs whenever a natural calamity or air controllers' strike grounds services.
It promised to lower or abolish the new charge if the European Commission reformed its laws.
Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said the airline has lost more than (EURO)100 million ($140 million) since 
April 2010 because of last summer's volcanic ash scare across Europe, last winter's heavy snowfall, and 
summertime air-traffic-control strikes in Belgium, France, Germany and Spain. He said the disruptions stranded 2.4 
million Ryanair customers and forced 15,000 flights to be canceled.
McNamara said European airport and air-safety authorities needlessly shut down services in all three cases and 
should be the ones held liable to repay the costs of stranded passengers.
"It is clearly unfair that airlines are obliged to provide meals and accommodation for passengers for days and weeks 
in some cases simply because governments close their airspace, or air traffic controllers walk off the job, or 
incompetent airports fail to clear their runways of snow," he said.
However, if Ryanair's figures are taken at face value, its new "compensation" scheme will actually generate the 
airline a profit of around (EURO)55 million ($80 million) annually even presuming that 2010's exceptional volume of 
airport shutdowns repeats itself.
Ryanair says it plans to sell 78 million one-way tickets in the upcoming April-March fiscal year. That means the levy 
being applied on all tickets from Monday onward will produce (EURO)156 million ($220 million) in extra revenue 
over the coming 12 months.
Ryanair expects next month to report a full-year net profit of at least (EURO)380 million ($535 million).
Ryanair to impose new anti-EU fee on all tickets
Those booking tickets on the airline must run a gamut of add-on costs. Some billed as airport taxes and fees are 
unavoidable. So too is Ryanair's policy of adding (EURO)24 ($34) to each round-trip ticket if normal credit or debit 
cards are used for payment.
Traveling with a baby on your lap costs (EURO)40 ($56) round trip. So does a single Ryanair-printed boarding card. 
Checking one bag costs at least (EURO)70 ($100), two bags up to (EURO)280 ($400). The right to stand in the 
fastest boarding line important on an airline with no seat assignments costs (EURO)5 ($7).

Ryanair is to charge an extra E2 on all bookings from April 4 to cover the cost to the airline of flight cancellations, 
delays and its EU261 costs covering events such as the Icelandic volcano plume and the severe snowfall last year.
It said that over the past year it has suffered costs of over E100m arising from flight cancellations, delays and 
providing right to care, compensation and legal expenses arising from more than 15,000 flight cancellations and 
over 2.4 million disrupted passengers.
"Ryanair believes that the unfair and discriminatory elements of the airline EU261 regulations should be amended 
to relieve airlines of the burden of providing care in cases where the cancellations and/or delays are clearly not the 
responsibility or fault of the airlines," it said.
"It is unfair and discriminatory that airlines are made liable for providing refunds, meals, hotels and phonecalls 
during ATC strikes, bad weather airport closures, or (volcanic) airspace closures when even travel insurance 
companies avoid liability during these "force majeure" events, and when competing transport providers (rail, ferries 
and coach operators) have no such "force majeure" liability under their equivalent EU261 regulations," Ryanair 
said.

The ISEQ took back some of the losses sustained earlier this week following a 44pc plunge in Irish Life and 
Permanent's shares, which were suspended today pending today's bank stress tests.
The index rose 9.98 points to 2,886.64.
Irish Life and Permanent suspended trading of its shares after media reports that banking stress tests this week 
might force it into state control. The Central Bank will outline tomorrow how much its lenders will eat into the 35 
billion euros set aside for the troubled sector from last year's 85 billion euro EU-IMF deal, hoping to put a final bill 
on a devastating banking crisis. A banking source confirmed that Irish Life, until now the only domestic lender to 
avoid a state bailout, will be hit hard by the tests, which are honing in on potential losses in Ireland's residential 
mortgage market. The banking source declined to say how large a stake the State may take in Irish Life, but shares 
fell 44pc on Tuesday to E0.40 after media speculated the results would force the bancassurer into state control. 
"Most, if not all, of the Irish banks will either be in full or majority state ownership following the announcements, 
given the scale of the required capital injections," Dermot O'Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers, 
wrote in a note.
Bank of Ireland shares were down 2c to E0.22 and AIB was flat at E0.19. Elsewhere, IFG has reported underlying 
operating profits of E24.4m, up from a restated E18m in 2009. Adjusted earnings of E21.6m compare with a 
restated E14.9m in 2009. Corresponding EPS of 18.77c compares with a restated 19.8c in 2009 and our forecast 
18c. Adjusted earnings/EPS are reported before amortisation of intangible assets, share based compensation, 
exceptional items, salaries of employees laid off and discontinued operations. The outcome is within the guided 
range of 18-20c. Attributable profits of E5.4m after exceptionals etc are broadly in line with the 2009 level. Shares in

Merchants charging artificially high fees to customers using debit or credit cards are facing investigation.
A diverse group including budget airlines, estate agents and taxi and insurance companies are accused of levying 
"excessive" fees to customers paying with cards, often springing the charge at the last point of transaction.
The consumer group Which? is issuing a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading today, asking it to probe "rip-off" 
charges.
Credit card surcharges are standard practice among some retailers, but a growing number, including estate agent 
Foxtons, broadband provider AOL and airline Ryanair, are now charging for debit cards.
Budget airlines came in for particular criticism, with Ryanair charging customers a £6 administration fee per 
passenger per flight with a debit or credit card.
The airline website says fees are charged "to defray substantial costs incurred". It claimed they were not 
surcharges and pointed out that bookings made with a MasterCard Prepaid Debit Card were free.
Use of debit cards now exceeds payment in cash in the UK, driven by the popularity of shopping online.
Retailers say they are passing on fees charged by banks for card use, but untangling such fees is tricky, because 
they vary depending on retailers and cards. Chip and pin payments with bank cards carry a lower fee than online or 
telephone transactions because of the lower risk of fraud.
Which? claims the cost of processing is no more than 20p for a debit card and 2 per cent of the transaction value 
for credit cards.
Admiral Insurance charges a 5.95 per cent fee for credit card use. "All credit card providers charge companies for 
processing card payments and we do not charge the customer this full amount," it said.
'Excessive' debit card fees face inquiry by OFT
Train booking website thetrainline.com said its £3.50 credit card charge "reflects all the costs associated with 
payments which includes the charges levied by credit card companies".
But card providers sought to distance themselves from the retailers. The UK Cards Association said it supported an 
investigation. "It is not good enough for some businesses to generate profit by imposing inflated surcharges when 
their actual card processing costs are substantially lower," said chair Melanie Johnson.
John Holmes, principal economist of Which?, accepted that card payment created a small cost to companies, but 
questioned the discrepancy with what was passed on.
"Large clothing retailers accept a large number of credit and debit card payments and do not charge, yet cab firms 
charge 12.5 per cent for debit or credit card use. We just don't see how that can possibly be a direct pass-on 
charge."

Shares have made early gains in Dublin this morning, recouping most of their losses of yesterday.
The gains were in line with a global trend, but investors around the world expecting good employment figures from 
the US this week.
In Dublin the ISEQ index was 17.91 points ahead a short time ago at 2,894.57.
The big news on the Dublin market was the suspension of trading in IL and P shares, following reports that 
tomorrow's bank stress tests will lead to it being taken over by the state. Among other shares, IFG was unchanged 
at 140 after reporting a rise in revenues but a fall in profits. CRH is up 7c to1672, with Smurfit Kappa ahead by 14c 
to 859 and Tullow adding 25c to 1649. Ryanair has lifted by 2c to 333 and Icon is up 70c to 1520.

Body
The Iseq-listed financial advisory company IFG is reporting its annual results from London and in sterling for the first 
time on Wednesday to emphasise its commitment to the British market.
The change in location and currency puts IFG among dual-listed companies such as Ryanair which prioritise the 
London market.
IFG, which derives more than half its revenue from fee-based pension advisory services in Britain and the North, 
said delivering 2010 results in London was part of a deeper engagement with the investment community there.
The move for the Dublin-based company is the latest effort in a strategy to raise investor awareness of its stock, 
which some analysts believe is massively underpriced, and to access deeper and more liquid sources of capital.
The company appointed London investment bank Macquarie as joint broker with Davy last year.
According to independent investment research firm Edison, IFG is trading at up to a 70 per cent discount, partly 
because it is seen as an Irish financial company, among such companies as AIB and Bank of Ireland.
IFG gets just 14 per cent of its revenue from its Irish operations, with a third coming from international trustee 
services and the remainder from Britain.
The company expects the proportion of its Irish income to shrink to 5 per cent by the end of next year.
Chief executive Mark Bourke has not ruled out an eventual switch to a primary listing in London.

Ryanair today opened its new E25m maintenance facility at Frankfurt Hahn Airport, creating 20 local jobs that, it 
said, could have gone to Dublin.
The airline called on the new Irish Govt to deliver on promised 'change and reform' to ensure that policy decisions 
will not again prevent jobs from being created or retained in Ireland.
"These high paid engineering jobs were the remainder of those lost by the Fianna Fail Govt and the incompetence 
of the Departments of Transport and Enterprise who rejected Ryanair's 2010 offers to create up to 600 jobs in 
Dublin Airport's Hangar 6," its statement said.
It claimed that, rather than support Ryanair's job creation Noel Dempsey (Transport) and Mary Coughlan 
(Enterprise) "stood idly by" while the DAA leased the Hangar 6 facility to Aer Lingus. It said that, over 12 months 
later, Aer Lingus has still not created one new engineering job while Ryanair has created over 500 new engineering 
jobs in Frankfurt Hahn and Glasgow Prestwick Airports. "The opening of Ryanair's new maintenance hangar in 
Frankfurt Hahn is a further significant investment in Ryanair's safety and maintenance. We are delighted to create 
up to 200 new engineering jobs in our new Frankfurt Hahn facility. The tragedy of today's development is that these 
jobs could have been created in an employment black-spot in North County Dublin, where SRT made over 1,000 
engineers redundant when Hangar 6 closed. Hangar 6 is now used by Aer Lingus as their Head Office and no new 
maintenance business or engineering jobs have been created," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara. "We hope the 
new Govt will deliver on their promise of 'change and reform' to ensure that incompetence in government 
departments is weeded out so that all possible jobs, especially high skilled high paid jobs such as those offered by 
Ryanair, remain in Ireland."

Captain James Anderson filed an unfair dismissal claim after he was fired by Ryanair for "gross misconduct"

The case has been settled prior to an employment tribunal hearing in London.
Ryanair claimed that 45-year-old Anderson, who had worked for the airline since 2001, had endangered passenger 
safety by handing the leaflets while the plane was en route from London to Majorca. Anderson's union, the British

The case was expected to last four days.
The dispute underscored bitter relations of Ryanair and Balpa, the pilots' union backing the claim. The Dublin-based

Ryanair's strained relationship with trade unions will come under fresh scrutiny today when a former pilot appears at 
an employment tribunal, alleging he was sacked for handing out a union recruitment leaflet.
Captain James Anderson, joined the low-cost airline in 2001 and was dismissed in 2009 for allegedly distributing 
trade union literature and membership forms to cabin crew during a flight.
The Dublin-based carrier has always refused to negotiate with unions and an attempt by British-based pilots to gain 
recognition for Balpa at the company failed just months before Mr Anderson was dismissed. Gill PlimmerFull

Spitfires for RIAT, 40 years on
Spitfire devotees rejoice: the Battle of Britain icon is back at this year's Royal International Air Tattoo, with the re-
appearance of two of the classic fighters that were at the first RIAT 40 years ago. Mk9 (MH434), owned by the Old 
Flying Machine Company, flew into North Weald airfield on 31 May 1971 for the first air tattoo. It was joined by 
PRXIX (PM631) from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. The pair will set the spirits soaring again at RAF Fairford 
this July.
UK aviation's coming of age
One of the most enthralling eras in UK aviation - 1964 through to deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s - is the 
subject of Guy Halford-Macleod's third in a series of books on the country's airlines. From the boom in long-haul 
travel during the Harold Wilson administration through to the free-market thinking of the Thatcher years, when Open 
Skies was implemented in Europe, Britain's Airlines (The History Press, £19.99) focuses on some of the 
personalities of the times, from Lord King - credited with saving BA - to maverick entrepreneurs Freddie Laker and 
Richard Branson. It also charts the changing political scene and how it led to the liberalised marketplace that helped 
create the likes of EasyJet and Ryanair. The Reginald S Potters among you will relish the many previously 
unpublished colour photographs, an aircraft index and passenger statistics.
Going for a song
Despite all the talk of corporate jets being essential business tools, time machines to transport masters of the 
universe around their global empires, it's nice to see that Airbus recognises that it's not all work, work, work on 
board these flying offices. Its latest Airbus Corporate Jet Phoenix cabin concept, targeted at the Asian market, 
includes an area for karaoke, an activity, it says, "typical of business entertainment and relaxation in much of Asia". 
On the count of four: "Come fly with me, come fly, come fly away"
A3-weighty

We were intrigued by this cutting from the 24 February issue of Plant Engineer. "The Airbus plant at Filton, Bristol is 
reporting improved safety and efficiency since installing Siemens' innovative e-stop emergency stop buttons. The 
site, which builds landing gear for the ground-breaking A380 aircraft". That'll be a strong undercarriage then. Let's 
hope it's only the ground that breaks.
More yuckspeak
A release from BAE's regional jet arm (yes, it still exists) tells us that: "In addition to marketing the aircraft 
internationally, BAE Systems will also use its extensive experience and relationships in aircraft leasing and finance 
to help bring sale opportunities for this aircraft to a conclusion." In other words: we'll find a buyer, Brian.
Mu-lolly
Alan Mulally - remember him? - has picked up $56.5 million in stock as reward for turning round the company he 
now runs, Ford. Maybe he'll now buy back the business jet the car maker disposed of three years ago following the 
storm over Detroit car chiefs flying to Washington on corporate aircraft to beg for a federal bailout (which Ford, of 
course, never took up).

Irish shares have moved ahead on a morning that has seen gains on markets across Europe.
Sentiment has improved on a belief that Japan is getting on top of its nuclear problems.
There are also hopes that this week will see big progress on easing Europe's debt problems.
Both these factors have outweighed concerns about the continuing blitz on Libya. THE ISEQ index was 10.09 
points ahead a short time ago at 2,797.17, having been as much as 24 points ahead earlier. DCC is up 21c to 2260, 
with Kerry Group advancing by 26c to 2666. Kingspan has risen 18c to 658 and Ryanair by 5c to 326. Elan is off by

Credit card company MBNA has written to barristers to inform them that it has ended its exclusive credit card 
partnership with the King's Inns.
In a letter to holders of the King's Inns credit card, MBNA said that it had ''worked successfully'' with the legal 
organisation for a number of years to provide a dedicated credit card for barristers and judges. However, the letter 
said it had ''now been decided to end our current relationship''.
From April 9, MBNA will no longer offer barristers and judges a dedicated credit card bearing the Kings Inns logo.
A spokeswoman for MBNA said that, following a review, it was decided that the ''credit card relationship'' with the 
King's Inns would cease. ''The number of customers with the King's Inns credit card is relatively small. However, we 
have notified them all of our intention to end this relationship," she said. "The terms and conditions for these 
customers do not change as a result," MBNA's spokeswoman added.
''They can continue to use their King's Inns credit card as normal until it expires and, when we come to reissue their 
cards, they will be MBNA-branded."
Affinity credit cards, where a group, company or organisation has a branded or personalised credit card, represents 
a significant part of MBNA's business. Current partners include EBS Building Society, Ryanair and Dublin SPCA.

THERE is no better sight in racing than the best two mile chasers in the world running at full pelt around the unique 
contours of Prestbury Park. The sportingbet.com Queen Mother Champion Chase is a truly mouthwatering contest 
and many punters will be hoping Master Minded can replicate his astonishing performance in 2008.
Then a five-year-old, Master Minded blasted his way into Cheltenham folklore with his display of speed and slick 
jumping.
He has never quite matched that day's feat, but he is unbeaten in three runs this season and a summer breathing 
operation seems to have worked the oracle. That said, he only just managed to hold Somersby at Ascot last time 
and there has to be a worry that he appears to perform better on softer ground.
Henrietta Knight has adopted her usual 'softly softly' approach with Somersby, as she does with all her top chasers. 
He seemed to get a little outpaced in last year's Arkle, but was doing all his best work at the finish and he will be 
staying on up the hill this afternoon. My worry with him is that he often drops back in the crucial middle phase of the 
race and is left with too much to do. The Ryanair would have been his ideal race and I doubt he will have enough 
speed to live with this field on good ground.
Moscow Flyer was Ireland's big hero in the last decade, but they could have another one in last year's winner BIG 
ZEB. Colm Murphy's pride and joy put in an imperious display of jumping 12 months ago, returning an easy six 
length winner at 10/1. The reason he was such a big price that day was that he had fallen in the Queen Mother the 
previous year and had regularly shown jumping frailties.

LOOKS AT THE QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE
However, his trainer seems to have ironed out all those problems and his fencing has become much more 
consistent.
He was beaten by his old rival Golden Silver at Punchestown last time, but that race wasn't run to suit and Barry 
Geraghty admitted that he got to the front too soon. He is a strong fancy at 11/4 with Sportingbet and I'd also be 
happy to buy him in a match bet against Master Minded with Sporting Index.
The Irish aren't just a one-man band this year, though, as both Captain Cee Bee and SIZING EUROPE hold each-
way claims. Captain Cee Bee was an easy winner of the Supreme Novices' Hurdle in 2008 and was sent off 
favourite in last year's Arkle only to finish a distant eighth after bleeding. He is lightly raced and was impressive 
when taking the Novice Chase at Punchestown last April.
Henry De Bromhead has had a strange season with Sizing Europe, experimenting in trip and he has now brought 
him back to two miles. His jumping wasn't as slick over the longer trips and it might be that he just needs to be 
running flat out to really concentrate and put his best foot forward. Arkle winners have a tremendous record in the 
Queen Mother the following season with the last 12 contenders all being placed at least.
Sponsors Sportingbet are refunding any horse that falls, unseats or is brought down in this race, so that really does 
back up my confidence in Big Zeb. Murphy has already said that the horse's biggest danger is himself and he does 
have the propensity to throw in the odd howler.
Finally, you can keep tabs on all of my Cheltenham betting news by following me live from the course on Twitter 
@BillEsdaile.
Big Zeb is the most likely winner for me at 11/4 and it will take a good one to beat him.

Ryanair today called on the new Government to scrap plans to link the City Centre and the Airport with the Metro 
North, saying it is a waste of money given the decline in passenger numbers.
It said the airport doesn't need and the country can't afford to pay for the E5 billion scheme.
Ryanair said, that at a time of rising unemployment and extremely tight Govt finances, there's no justification for 
digging up St Stephen's Green and tunnelling through North Co Dublin, simply to link the airport with the city centre.
It said the declining traffic numbers at Dublin Airport are more than adequately dealt with through the excellent 
motorway (M50) network and competitive bus services from the airport to the city centre. "If the new government is 
committed to 'real change and reform', then it should start by cancelling these grossly excessive white elephant 
building projects, designed by quangos and supported by civil servants, which squander untold sums of money 
providing infrastructure which isn't needed and which the Irish taxpayer cannot afford," said Stephen McNamara. 
"The airport and North County Dublin are already well served with an excellent motorway network and competitive 
bus services. In addition, the DART line connects considerable portions of North County Dublin with the city centre 
and there is no justification for wasting another E5bn on yet another non-integrated Metro from the city centre to 
Dublin Airport. At a time when Ireland's corporation tax is under threat, when as a nation we are spending more 
money that we are earning, we simply can't afford another white elephant infrastructure project like the Dublin 
Airport Metro. We hope the new Government will signal a real change in the failed policies of previous Fianna Fail 
led administrations and cancel this E5bn white elephant before another cent is wasted on it."

What are the main responsibilities of your job?
I am responsible for the financial management of the business, including budgetary forecasts. I develop company 
strategy, implement policies and support our sales team.
What are your professional motivators?
I am driven to be the best and to seek growth, personally and professionally. I believe that I am professional in all of 
my business dealings.
How would you describe your work style?
I am an optimist and I go on my gut instinct.
What rates as your best business decision to date?
In June 2008,when the downturn hit us, we looked at our business model and made vital changes.
As a brand, we realised that we were predominantly viewed as a west of Ireland company. To change this 
perception, we redesigned our logo, brand and website.
We recruited three sales representatives in Dublin and one in Cork, and also created the online shopping site 
www.westernhygiene.ie.
To help fund this, we implemented our credit policy fully, helping us to reduce debtor days, pay suppliers faster and 
improved confidence with our trading partners and banks.
What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned?
Working Week
It was the decision to develop the company in line with a five-year business plan that we drew up in September 
2008.
The move renewed our focus on the future of the business. It prompted us to invest in our employees, by training 
and supporting them, so that they in turn could help the business to grow and develop.
Who do you most admire in Irish business?
I admire Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair.
He broke the 'standard practice' approach to air travel, thought outside the box and built a business empire. In 
doing so, he opened up overseas markets for many SME owners.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
Business conditions will remain tough, given the most recent budget and restricted credit facilities from banks.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
I want Western Hygiene Supplies to become a recognised brand across Ireland and, eventually, overseas.

As an experienced actress, Danielle Ryan isn't normally one for stage fright, but she confesses to being nervous 
when she was asked to make a speech recently.
That may have been because the venue was the UN General Assembly Hall in New York and the audience 
included leading figures in business and charity from around the world.
From the podium ''where Superman made his speech'', Ryan announced that the Cathal Ryan Trust, set up in 
memory of her father, was giving $14 million to help children in Sri Lanka.
The donation is being channelled through Unicef, and is one of the biggest personal donations the UN body has 
ever received. It will fund schools and maternity hospitals in four towns in Sri Lanka, where Cathal Ryan, a co-
founder of Ryanair, trained as a pilot in the late 1970s.
When he died in 2007, aged 48, his  250 million will instructed that  35million should go to charitable purposes, with 
a focus on children and education.
The partnership with Unicef is the trust's second public project, after the creation of the Lir, a new ''academy of 
dramatic art'' in Dublin, in conjunction with Trinity College. Donating to Sri Lanka was an easy decision, said 
Danielle Ryan.
''It was something that was always there for my dad, almost since he was out there.
Then, in the early '80s, civil war broke out, so there was never a time we could get back in. He died in 2007 and the 
war only finished in 2009," she said. ''We wanted to find a way of doing a partnership with Unicef that would remain 
as a legacy for Dad.
We wanted it to be tangible enough that it could be intergenerational, so that our children and my grandchildren can 
return to these places."

Ryan settled on a partnership with Unicef after dealing with the agency's Irish staff, Melanie Verwoerd and Kieran 
O'Brien. ''I got very nervous at the idea of world aid," she said.
''What happens to your money? How much can you can control and where does it go? Is it all going to go towards 
salaries? But from day one, they said 'well, what would you like to do?"'
Already a regular visitor to Sri Lanka, Ryan travelled there with Unicef at the start of last year, to establish the best 
way to spend the money.
''After the first initial trip, we said we'd isolate it down to health and education.
There's loads of things that come out of that, like health and sanitation and children's rights. It also includes things 
like making sure that all the schools and hospitals are wheelchair accessible, because the north of the country is 
still littered with mines," she said.
She has been back to Sri Lanka three times since, leading up to the public announcement of the donation on 
February 28. ''When we were at the UN,I was thinking 'why am I being asked to speak?'.
I realised that the point was to try to talk to other donors, on behalf of my father, and say 'this is not a bad idea', to 
leave something in your will. It's a nice idea, it's a nice thing to allow your next generation to do, because it does put 
things into perspective," she said.
Ryan is going back to Sri Lanka in August, with another trip planned soon after that. She is heavily involved in the 
details of the projects, right down to worrying about the books for the school libraries and sports equipment for the 
children.
''Before each trip, there is a huge amount of work.
We go through everything with a fine-tooth comb. Can we see the floor plans for the schools? How many computers 
do we need? It really is about looking after every part of it."
The Trust's donation also covers the provision of grants to small businesses in Sri Lanka, which is an area Ryan is 
keen to develop.
''This is something Unicef don't tend to do because they are children based, but the way I see it is that it's all 
relevant - these are children's parents and they're going to employ people," said Ryan.
She said that her father would have been ''delighted'' with the project. ''It's exactly what he would have wanted and 
it's actually getting done. I know he would be flattered with the comments in the UN last week and what people 
were saying to us afterwards. It was nice to be part of that in the UN- I don't think they were expecting any 
donations to come from Ireland."
Back home, Ryan is facing into a second round of auditions for the Lir, an academy that will open in September with 
a three-year degree course in acting and other courses for script writers and technical professionals.
Her to-do list also includes interviewing for an artistic director for the academy, which is formally associated with the 
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London, where Ryan gained her own acting credentials.
Like the Sri Lankan project, the idea for the Lir was in gestation for a long time. ''It started off because I was in Rada 
and, in a typical Ryan way, the family were saying: 'How come you have to go to England? We should do 
something here'."
The Ryans, who had built a theatre at their home, hatched a plan for an acting academy ''over the kitchen table'', 
she said. ''While Dad was alive, we looked at doing it in Maynooth.
Ryan Fund at work at home and abroad
After he died, recession hit and it just wasn't viable. It looked like the project might die then, but I was still quite 
adamant [it would go ahead]," she said. She went back and talked to her former lecturers in Rada about the plan, 
and they pointed her in the direction of Brian Singleton, Trinity's head of drama.
The next step was to take the idea to the industry. ''We were very, very nervous at the beginning," said Ryan. ''We 
were thinking: 'they're going to wonder who the hell do they think they are', but they were unbelievably receptive."
She remembers giving a talk about the proposed academy when Alan Rickman and Fiona Shaw came in and sat in 
the front row. ''I thought, 'Oh God, I'm out of my depth here'. I could see all the big casting directors, all the 
playwrights, all these serious, serious names.
But they all gave their opinion and they were really grateful for someone doing something.
''We spent a year-and-a-half listening to the industry and meeting them one-by-one, asking what they would like to 
see done. We took down everyone's opinion and that all went into the course design.
We also went to Rada and said 'if you could do anything, what would you do?' So they designed their ideal course 
and we took exactly what they came up with."
The result is an unconventional institution, where students aren't selected on CAO points, barely put pen to paper 
during the year, and are judged by their peers and the industry.
''It's completely practical based. It's two years of training, 35 hours a week, and then a full year of productions back 
to back that are open to the public.
That's their exam," said Ryan.
About 40 prospective students have already auditioned for the 14 places on the acting course, with another batch of 
auditions taking place this week. ''They really will be trained at an extremely high standard.
Through Trinity and Rada, they will be exposed to agents and casting directors in LA and New York and London, 
you name it."
The trust's donation for the Lir is ''sort of a moving target'', but includes the full cost of the building, paying for 
Rada's involvement for five years ''and a lot of things that come with it'', she said. ''We have to keep the numbers 
small, because it's extremely expensive to train actors.
We'll know the final figure at the end, but it's not cheap."
The Lir will have three theatre spaces, with the biggest holding 250 people.
The top floor will have dance and rehearsal studios, while there will be a small bar and restaurant in the lobby.
Because it's a training academy with free actors, Ryan expects to attract guest directors to stage plays that 
financially wouldn't work in a main theatre.
The hardest part of the project was getting the proper legal structure in place, said Ryan. ''Rada have never given 
their brand to anyone else.
And for Trinity to have a stand-alone college that's not on the campus and has its own governance - that was 
something Trinity had never really done before.
They've all come around, but trying to get this initial concept past the line was the hardest thing to do. It's been a 
tiring one and I'm absolutely shocked that we got everything we wanted."
Ryan Fund at work at home and abroad
The process had its compensations as well. ''I've had a fascinating journey, because I've got to sit down with all my 
hero playwrights and actors," she said, detailing lunch with Pierce Brosnan and phone calls with Daniel Day-Lewis. 
''I got to write letters back and forth with Brian Friel, which is a conversation I never thought I'd have.
''These guys are all our ambassadors now - people like Colm Meaney, Conor McPherson, Sebastian Barry, Saoirse 
Ronan, Garry Hynes and Michael Colgan.
They have agreed to do master classes in the academy, they've agreed to promote it when possible, and give us 
feedback all the time. They will just watch over it lovingly, which is fantastic."
With the Lir and the Unicef project well-advanced, Ryan will be taking a step back, although she is keeping a close 
eye on how they develop. ''Each of these projects is treated very much like a business and we will be scrutinising 
them on figures and everything else.
You do want to make sure that money is being spent well and correctly.
''I think it's important to do things in that much depth, otherwise there's not much point. If we had just signed the 
cheque, we'd have missed out on all the big lessons that it can teach you. Both projects have seriously humbled 
me." There is still money in the Cathal Ryan Trust for other projects, which are likely to fall under the same 
headings of children and the arts.
''I'm saying that's it for the moment, but I really don't know. I'd like to get these two done properly and then we'll see.
There will be other things in the future. It's going to be an interesting few years," Ryan said.
Between her work on the Trust, having a toddler and a second child due in June, Ryan's own acting career is on 
hold for the time being. ''Coming back from London means you're sort of out of the game a little bit, but I don't mind. 
I'm very, very happy. I feel like maybe this is what I was supposed to do with my Rada degree," she said.
''The Lir being put to bed is the first really great step. It gives me a little bit of confidence that having a ridiculous 
ambition like that can sometimes be achieved. It's good to know."

Four in ten Irish people over the age of 50 use the internet regularly, a new survey has found.
The most popular sites for the over-50s are Google, Facebook and Ryanair, while 80 per cent of those who are 
online use e-mail. A surprising one third are on Facebook.
However, just 2 per cent have a blog.
The results were released last week at the Business of Ageing conference and covered 500 adults, who were 
surveyed in the first two months of this year.
There are more than 1.2million over-50s in Ireland, nearly 28 per cent of the population.
Those surveyed showed regional and gender differences in online habits.
Skype account holders tend to be male and from Leinster, while those on Facebook tend to be female and Dublin 
based.
There are twice as many 50plus Facebook users in Dublin (43 per cent of the online over50s) as in Munster (20 per 
cent) or Connaught/Ulster (20 per cent).
And almost 100 per cent of those questioned watch television. The survey was carried out by the Business of 
Ageing Partnership, a not-for-profit group formed to highlight business opportunities in the older consumer market.

Irish shares have slipped again this morning for a third day.
The ISEQ index was down 8.69 points a short time ago at 2,886.19.
Shares on other European markets have also dropped in early trade, following a new downgrade by Moody's of 
Spain's sovereign debt.
The move has fanned fears that the debt crisis in Europe may still be far from a solution. The FTSE 100, the Dax 
index in Frankfurt and the CAC-40 in paris are all down 0.7pc. In Dublin, many of the market's big names shipped 
losses. CRH is down 6c to 1538, with DCC off by 9c to 2320, Ryanair 5c lower at 340 and Smurfit Kappa dropping 
by 23c to 852. Origin jumped by 22c, however, to 405 after an upbeat set of half year figures and a takeover of two 
firms in the UK. Elan has edged up by 9c to 485 and Aryzta is 33c higher at 3410.

Highlight: European shares turned negative in afternoon trade yesterday, mirroring losses on Wall Street
Body
European shares turned negative in afternoon trade yesterday, mirroring losses on Wall Street, as oil prices 
rebounded on the back of intensifying clashes in Libya and a bond auction in Portugal failed to ease concerns the 
country would need a bailout.
Paris was 8.57 points lower at 4007.34 while Frankfurt managed a slight rise, up 7.69 to 7172.44. London's FTSE 
fell 37.46 to close at 5937.3
In Dublin the Iseq fell 29.17 points to 2,894.88.
Greencore edged up 1c to E1.18 after ruling out a new offer for Northern Foods. It will not now make a new bid for 
British counterpart Northern Foods, after failing to reach an agreement that would offer strong returns to its 
shareholders. Davy analyst Aiden O'Donnell said: "The long-running saga of whether there would be a counter-bid 
or not is now over. The focus will now turn to the existing business and how it is currently trading against the 
backdrop of rising input costs and a difficult UK consumer. On our 2011 estimates, the stock trades on an 
undemanding EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.5x with a dividend yield of 6.4 per cent." DCC rose 17c to E23.32 after it 
bought the north of England electronic office supplies company Advent Data for up to E29.4m. The Leeds-based 
company distributes office supplies to resellers, retailers and e-tailers in the UK. It has 111 employees. Advent 
made an adjusted operating profit of E4.5m for its financial year to August lasr on revenues of E150.1m. The deal 
values the company at E24.2m, including net debt of E7.2m. Caren Crowley of Davy said: "The transaction is 
typical of DCC's approach to acquisitions and looks a clever deal for DCC. DCC points out that the acquisition of 
Advent complements its strong market position in reseller distribution in the UK through its Micro-P business." 
Airlines were stronger after good results from Lufthansa, with Aer Lingus adding 6c to E0.90 and Ryanair gaining 6c 
to E3.45. Of the day's fallers, CRH dropped 52c to E15.45 while Kerry fell 18c to E27.01. Providence Resources 
lost 13c to E3.17 and Fyffes slid 3c to E0.41.

European markets were mixed this morning with gains by banking and energy stocks offset by worries over the 
impact of high oil prices on the economic recovery.
London's FTSE was up 38 points (0.65 per cent) to stand at 6,029 by 12.15am, while the Paris CAC was down 13 
points (0.3 per cent) to 4,007 and the Frankfurt DAX eased 15 points (0.2 per cent) to 7,164.
Dublin's ISEQ index inched 5.7 points higher to stand at 2,925 by 12.15am, with shares in Paddy Power up 0.7 per 
cent to E29.60 after it reported an increase in profits in all of its divisions last year.
Other gainers today included Ryanair, up 1.8 per cent to E3.45 and Kerry, which gained 1.3 per cent to stand at 
E27.20. Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei index slumped 189 points (1.7 per cent) to close at 10,505 as fears of more turmoil 
in the Middle East and higher oil prices overshadowed solid US jobs data. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong 
dipped 96 points (0.4 per cent) to finish at 23,313. US stocks on Friday lost nearly half of the ground gained in the 
previous day's surge as Middle East turbulence and the resulting high oil prices trumped positive economic news 
going into the weekend. The Dow Jones was off 88 points (0.7 per cent) at 12,170 at the close, while the Nasdaq 
Composite gave up 14 points (0.5 per cent) to end at 2,785.

A charitable trust set up with funds from the late Cathal Ryan is giving $14 million to help children in Sri Lanka.
The Cathal Ryan Trust, set up after the death of the Ryanair co-founder in 2007, has struck a two-year partnership 
with Unicef to build and equip schools in Sri Lanka and refurbish healthcare facilities for children and mothers. Ryan 
left almost  250 million in his will, including 35 million to charity.
The Sri Lankan project is the trust's first partnership with an international development agency, and is being carried 
out in collaboration with Unicef Ireland.
Cathal Ryan spent time in Sri Lanka in the late 1970s and trained as a pilot there. His first wife, Tess de Cretze, is 
Sri Lankan and their daughter, Danielle, runs the Cathal Ryan Trust.
The donation was announced at a United Nations event on philanthropy and education in New York last week.
Speaking at the event, Danielle Ryan said her father had ''directed in his will that a substantial portion of his fortune 
be donated towards the lives and education of children in Sri Lanka''.

Irish shares went into reverse half way through today's session in line with markets in most other centres.
Reasonable early gains had seen the ISEQ index up by 22 points, or 0.7pc, early on. But the rally did not hold.
The reason? US jobs data that failed to impress investors.
The jobs data is seen as pretty well the key measure on how the US economy is recovering from recession. And 
the importance of the US economy means it is seen as a proxy for the health of the western economy generally. 
The data showed 192,000 jobs were added in February, a number that was short of the most optimistic forecasts. 
Analysts also said February's payrolls data was exaggerated by the hit to January figures from bad weather. They 
added that much of the February increase was already priced into markets, with expectations rising this week after 
earlier reports showed robust private-sector hiring and an unexpectedly sharp decline in jobless claims. US stocks 
slipped back on the news, with shares across Europe shedding gains from morning trade. The FTSE 100 was down 
0.24pc at tonight's close, with the Dax in Frankfurt off by 0.65pc and the CAC-40 in Paris 1pc lower. Back in Dublin 
the ISEQ index shed its gains, going modestly into the red to close 4.22 points down on the day at 2,926.21. Among 
the big names, building materials giant CRH ended 14c down at 1593, with drug maker Elan off by 2c to 461 and 
boxmaker Smurfit Kappa down 12c to 878. Ryanair was up 3c to 343 and Aer Lingus gained 1c to 87 on an 
improving outlook for the sun holiday market. Bloxham Stockbrokers pointed today to buoyancy in travel shares 
after a prediction by Greece's tourism minister that numbers will rise by 11pc this year. The broker said a similar 
prediction was made a couple of weeks ago by tourism agencies in the Canaries. Davy analyst Stephen Furlong 
added that Ryanair was also being helped by a 1pc increase in its load factor to 76pc. Rising prices for dairy goods 
provided some good news for Irish food shares, with Glanbia adding 2c to 440. Davy analyst John O'Reilly said milk 
powder prices in the southern hemisphere, a major determinant of world terends, have risen by 30pc since the end 
of 2010. "As we head into the Irish milk production season, the trading outlook for farmers and processors remains

positive," he says. Shares in the DIY and builders' merchanting group Grafton fell again by 12c to 350 as the 
company struggles to get over the downturn in the construction sector. Davy's Flor O'Donoghue said the shares' fall 
should soon "present an excellent opportunity to buy into an attractive recovery play". Among other movers were 
insulation specialist Kingspan, off by 18c to 662 and energy explorer Providence Resources, 12c lower at 338. On a 
more positive note, distribution group DCC was up by 17c to 2337 and baker Anyzta added 10c to 3390. Medicine

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary  was his usual punchy self as he declined an invitation to the annual black tie 
industry bash hosted by the Airport Operators Association at the Grosvenor House on Tuesday. AOA chairman Ed 
Anderson read out Mr O'Leary's letter in which he said he tried to "avoid supping with the devil wherever possible", 
and "I hope all the monopolists choke on their chicken nuggets".
Virgin Atlantic chief Steve Ridgway , who gave the main speech, was also not shy of having a go at rivals. He 
congratulated BMI for one of the great start-ups of the year: it launched its new service to Tripoli on February 21 
and suspended it the next day. On British Airways, he referred to Superbrands' business top-10 list, saying Virgin 
and BA had fallen out, but making the point BA had fallen to 48th place - and Virgin only to 14th.

News In Brief
## Ulster Bank economist Simon Barry has forecast that the European Central Bank will begin to increase euro 
zone interest rates in the third quarter of this year. He says he expects a series of quarter-point hikes to take rates 
from the current 1pc to 2.5pc by the end of 2012. Mr Barry said the ECB was facing a combination of inflation 
pressures and higher than expected economic activity. He said that while there had been no sign of key phrases 
such as 'strong vigilance', the ECB's rhetoric had become more hawkish on inflation recently.The economist also 
said he expected the Bank of England to become the first major central bank to increase rates, with a quarter-point 
rise in May. - RTE
## Ryanair has announced the resignation of its director of commercial revenue, Sinead Finn. She will now be 
establishing her own consultancy practice. Finn has worked with Ryanair since 1998 in a variety of positions 
including sales manager for Italy, head of sales and marketing and, since 2008, as director of commercial revenue 
in charge of commercial relationships with Ryanair's ancillary partners. "We are sorry to see Sinead leave but 
understand her desire to set up her own business," said Ryanair's Michael Cawley. - Irish Examiner
## The Dublin Airport Authority has rejected a proposal from Ryanair which the airline said would increase traffic at 
Shannon airport by 1m passengers a year by 2016. In a statement, the airport authority said Ryanair's demands 
were "unreasonable" and said the terms would be "financially ruinous" for any airport. The state-owned company 
said Ryanair wanted Shannon to pay it 4.70 euros for every new passenger it brought to the airport. Ryanair also 
proposed that it pay no landing or aircraft charges at Shannon for new passengers and sought free check-in desks, 
offices and communications. In addition, Ryanair wanted the authority to repay 3.7m euros million that it paid the 
airport group in January to settle a High Court case relating to a previous deal. The airport authority said the airline 
wanted this paid up front and described it as "hello money". - Irish Times ## Paddy Power has completed the

acquisition of the remaining 39.2pc shareholding in Australian bookies Sportsbet for Aus Dlr 132.6m (97m euros ). 
As part of the deal, the bookmaker issued 455,535 ordinary shares of 10c each to Sportsbet shareholders. Earlier, 
Power's shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favour of purchasing the stake. - Irish Independent ## Siemens 
Ireland has appointed Paul Lynam as chief executive and Brian Flannery as chief financial officer for Ireland. Mr

News In Brief
## Ulster Bank economist Simon Barry has forecast that the European Central Bank will begin to increase euro 
zone interest rates in the third quarter of this year. He says he expects a series of quarter-point hikes to take rates 
from the current 1pc to 2.5pc by the end of 2012. Mr Barry said the ECB was facing a combination of inflation 
pressures and higher than expected economic activity. He said that while there had been no sign of key phrases 
such as 'strong vigilance', the ECB's rhetoric had become more hawkish on inflation recently.The economist also 
said he expected the Bank of England to become the first major central bank to increase rates, with a quarter-point 
rise in May. - RTE
## Ryanair has announced the resignation of its director of commercial revenue, Sinead Finn. She will now be 
establishing her own consultancy practice. Finn has worked with Ryanair since 1998 in a variety of positions 
including sales manager for Italy, head of sales and marketing and, since 2008, as director of commercial revenue 
in charge of commercial relationships with Ryanair's ancillary partners. "We are sorry to see Sinead leave but 
understand her desire to set up her own business," said Ryanair's Michael Cawley. - Irish Examiner

Investors on the Dublin market largely ignored some strong corporate results today and concentrated instead on 
fears of what prolonged high oil prices may do to the economy and to firms' bottom lines.
The index slid 37.50 points to 2,921.66.
Results from Irish Life and Permanent, Glanbia and Fyffes failed to lift the mood as investors took profits in line with 
peers around Europe amid fears of prolonged high oil prices, fuelled by spreading political unrest in the oil-rich 
Middle East and North Africa, weighed on European shares, with automakers taking the biggest hit. "Oil is 
dampening positive economic signals from China to Germany," Anita Paluch, a trader at ETX Capital in Frankfurt 
said.
Brent crude oil prices rose to USD117 a barrel on international markets with IATA saying that global airlines could 
see a 50pc fall in average profits on cost rises, especially aviation fuel. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 4c to E0.87 and 
Ryanair climbed 2c to E3.37. CRH, a big user of oil, was the biggest faller with stocks down 41c to E15.91. Irish Life 
and Permanent recorded a pre-tax operating loss of E197m for 2010, in line with the 2009 outcome and compared 
with brokers recently revised forecast loss of E199m. The group has confirmed that its attempt to merge permanent 
tsb with EBS has not been successful, but it continues to believe that the logic for consolidation remains compelling. 
"The results are broadly in line with expectations, reflecting the recent statement that impairment losses would be 
E80-100m above earlier expectations due to a change in peak-to-trough Irish property value assumptions. With 
prospects ultimately hinging on a solution for the bank, all eyes will now turn to the PCAR/PLAR results (due at end-
March), which will determine what is required of the bank in terms of de-leveraging and capital adequacy," said 
Davy's Emer Lang. Shares in the bank and assurance firm fell 6c to E0.88. Bank of Ireland stocks were flat at E0.33

billion in junior bonds, figures from the Central Bank show. Food and ingredients group Glanbia has posted 2010 
earnings at the top end of expectations, on strong global demand for dairy goods and its expansion in the US 
market for nutritionals. "Global dairy markets are expected to remain firm, underpinned by robust demand, 
particularly from Asia," managing director John Moloney said this morning. Glanbia's 2010 adjusted earnings per 
share rose 24pc to 38 euro cents, beating a forecast by analysts of 37c. Shares in the group fell 1c to E4.29. 
Shares in Fyffes fell 1c to E0.43 after it reported pre-tax profits of E21.3m for last year, broadly in line with the 
previous year. This figure does not include once-off items and its share of losses at property group Balmoral. Total 
revenue - which included its share of joint ventures - was 2pc higher at E742.1m. Earnings per share rose 6pc to 
5.5 cent and a 9pc higher final dividend of 1.2 cent is proposed.

News In Brief
## US billionaire investor Wilbur Ross yesterday claimed his private equity consortium could take control of EBS 
"within the next few months" after entering into exclusive talks on the deal late last week. But informed sources said 
the Cardinal consortium, which includes Mr Ross, the US-based Carlyle group and Dublin's Cardinal, had been 
given a "window of opportunity" to address "significant issues". Cardinal and Irish Life and Permanent had been 
locked in a two-way bidding war until IL&P was elbowed out of the process late last week. "It's another step 
forward," Mr Ross told CNBC. "It's a step that should hopefully lead to the completion of the deal over the next few 
months." Mr Ross said there would be further negotiation, but he described the process as "fine tuning" so the two 
parties could "get to a definitive agreement". - Irish Independent
## A former personal assistant to U2's Adam Clayton has been sent forward for trial on charges of embezzling 
almost 3m euros from the guitarist. Carol Hawkins, 47, of Crannagh Road Rathfarnham, faces 184 charges under 
the Theft and Fraud Offences Act. Ms Hawkins is accused of theft from accounts in name of Adam Clayton on 
various dates between 2005 and 2008. At Dublin District Court, Detective Sergeant Clodagh White of the Garda 
Bureau of Fraud Investigation served her with the book of evidence in three volumes. - Irish Examiner
## Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller said he would support the sale of Cork and Shannon airports, 
describing the auction of state-owned infrastructure assets as delivering a "moment of truth" in terms of their 
business case. He was speaking as the airline reported its first move into the black since 2007, posting an 
operating profit before exceptional items of 57.6m euros for 2010. However, he conceded that pushing through the 
sale of the airports to the private sector -- a move that is also supported by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary -- would 
be difficult. - Irish Independent ## The Commercial Court has granted judgment of more than 1.5m euros in favour

as he left almost all of his estate to the Catholic Church under various headings. Mr O Suilleabhain left 75,000

Holdings is a major shareholder, after April 2009 when Nama was unveiled. No discounts were imposed on

use. In court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly said he had 'plundered' money bound for charity. He said Donal O Suilleabhain, 
of Bulloch Harbour in Dalkey, who died in July 2006, was clearly a charitable man who was attached to his church, 
as he left almost all of his estate to the Catholic Church under various headings. Mr O Suilleabhain left 75,000 
euros to Archbishop Martin, as well as a further 1.5m euros for the Archbishop to use for charitable purposes, but 
only 55,000 euros was paid. - RTE ## The National Asset Management Agency imposed no haircut on AIB's loan 
on the Montevetro building in Dublin as the loan was provided after the Government announced plans for the 
agency. AIB lent about 30m euros to the developer of the building, Real Estate Opportunities, in which Treasury 
Holdings is a major shareholder, after April 2009 when Nama was unveiled. No discounts were imposed on 
development loans provided after April 2009 following an agreement between the banks and Central Bank governor 
John Hurley. The purpose of the agreement was to prevent the banks from ceasing all development lending amid 
fears that Nama would apply losses on new loans to developers. - Irish Times ## Boeing has delivered the 300th 
version of its 737-800 aircraft to low cost carrier, Ryanair. Chief executive Michael O'Leary signed a post-911 
contract with Boeing at bargain rates for the 737s he's been receiving, and he wants similar bargain prices for 
follow-on orders. However, Boeing has declined to drop its prices as far as O'Leary wants.

The rebound on the ISEQ continued this morning bring the index past the 3,000 level briefly before profit taking took 
some of the shine off the rally.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 6.81 points to 2,983.35.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) released this morning (March 1st) indicates that the strong growth of the 
Irish manufacturing sector continued into 2011. The overall index rose significantly to a reading of 56.7 in February, 
up from 55.8 in January. Encouragingly, the strength of manufacturing output was mainly due to new orders, 
particularly export orders. New export orders expanded by the second-highest rate in the series' history.
CRH reported full-year 2010 results that were broadly in line with guidance issued with the IMS in November at the 
revenue and operating profit levels but ahead in terms of PBT and net income due to lower finance and tax costs. 
"The outlook for 2011 was reasonably positive with management expecting progress this year and "stronger upward 
momentum thereafter," said Davy's Barry Dixon. The building materials group CRH has reported pre-tax profits of 
E534m for last year, down 27pc from 2009. Total sales at the group fell by just 1pc to E17.2 billion, though there 
was a fall of 7pc when acquisitions and currency movements were stripped out. Shares in CRH fell 8c to E16.71. 
Post Aer Lingus results, Davy are lowering estimates and now assume operating profit of E19.4m in 2011 (from 
E62.1m) and E55m for 2012. Analyst, Stephen furlong said he notes the business is expected to be profitable in 
2011 but, even at 2010 fuel prices, the increase in airport charges would have resulted in lower profits in 2011. "Our 
assumption implies oil at c.dollar 950 per tonne (to better align with other airlines under our coverage); each dollar 
50 per tonne has a E6m impact on estimated 2011 fuel costs." Apart from fuel, the biggest impact on 2011 is 
increased airport charges (E45m). "In addition, we expect c.E25m of exceptional costs in 2011 (representing IT 
upgrades) - leaving the net income number just above breakeven." Aer Lingus shares gained 2c to E0.93 while 
Ryanair climbed 4c to E3.41. The IBF/PwC mortgage market profile shows that the demand/supply of new 
ISEQ close to 3,000 as rebound continues ISEQ Up
mortgages hit a new low in Q4 2010. The number of new mortgages issued fell by 43.5pc year-on-year (yoy) in the 
quarter to 5,624 (E982m). This brings full-year issuance to 27,666 (E4.7bn), down by 40pc on 2009. Separately, 
figures released by the Regulator show mortgages 90+ days in arrears stood at 5.7pc at the end of 2010, up from 
5.1pc at end-September. Shares in Bank of Ireland fell 1c to E0.34 while Irish Life and Permanent dropped 3c to 
E0.95.

Body
Barclays Capital has appointed Josh Connor as the new head of global transportation investment banking within the 
bank's global industrials investment group. Connor, who joins from Morgan Stanley, will join in July and be based in 
New York.
In his new role, Connor will be responsible for overseeing and expanding the firm's relationships with transportation 
companies. He will report to John Miller, head of the global industrials group within investment banking.
"His vast experience as a trusted advisor to corporations worldwide will be highly valuable as we partner with our 
clients," Miller says.
While at Morgan Stanley, Conner was managing director and co-head of the transportation and infrastructure 
group. He was also a member of the investment banking management committee and the board of the Morgan 
Stanley Foundation.
During his 15-year tenure, Connor played a leading role in many of the sector's most notable initial public offerings 
(IPOs), equity offerings, convertible and structured financings.
Conner has worked on various mergers and acquisitions, including advising on Continental's merger with United; 
Northwest's merger with Delta; and Canadian Pacific Railway on its purchase of the Dakota, Minnesota and 
Eastern Rail (DM&E).
Some of the IPOs Connor worked on include JetBlue, Ryanair, Copa, Gol and Tiger Airways.
A Barclays spokesperson says that the appointment is part of the bank's effort to bolster its coverage of the 
industrial sector. In June 2010, Miller became head of the global industrials group, in addition to his role as head of 
the global financial sponsors investment banking group in New York.
Also in June 2010, Reid Marsh joined the firm in London as chairman of the global industrials group. Larry Hamdan

Aer Lingus takes wing but warns on fuel
Aer Lingus takes wing but warns on fuel

Body
Aer Lingus overcame industrial tension, volcanic ash and snow disruption to report its first profit in three years on 
Monday but warned of "significant challenges" to its earnings this year if fuel prices remained high.
Ireland's flag-carrier said it had swung to a pre-tax profit of EUR30.4m (£26m) for 2010, against a EUR154.8m pre-
tax loss in the previous year, on revenues barely changed at EUR1.2bn.
The improvements follow a year of cost-cuts and capacity reductions, and a repositioning of Aer Lingus as a 
"professional but affordable" middle choice between full-service carriers such as British Airways and budget airlines 
such as rival Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline by passenger numbers.
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, said the prospect of Middle East unrest, the uncertainty of having a 
home market in one of Europe's most troubled economies, and higher charges at Dublin airport meant "we expect 
significant challenges in 2011".
"We do not expect the improvements in yield performance and ongoing cost-savings can offset these increased 
costs.
"If current fuel prices persist, we expect 2011 operating profit will be significantly below that of 2010."
Aer Lingus, the latest European airline to warn of lower profits, has just over 60 per cent of its fuel hedged for 2011. 
"Clearly if oil stays at $100-plus it's a big headache," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers.
"It was only 12 weeks ago that everybody was bulled up on airlines globally, but now everybody is extremely 
gloomy. It's a manic-depressive industry."
Ryanair is Aer Lingus's largest shareholder with a 29.8 per cent stake, following two thwarted takeover attempts. 
Another 25 per cent is held by the Irish government, which is still being formed after the weekend's elections .
Aer Lingus takes wing but warns on fuel
Mr Mueller said the new government had "an obligation to the taxpayer" not to sell its stake when the share price 
was relatively low, and to ensure any buyer "can guarantee there will be a two-carrier policy on the Irish Sea 
sector".
  FT Comment 
Investors in Ireland's oldest airline could hardly have hoped for a better result than the profits unveiled on Monday, 
having seen Aer Lingus buffeted by global recession, domestic economic crisis and a shareholder register best 
described as tricky. The news came in the same breath as a profit warning amid the familiar uncertainty of rising 
fuel prices. Such is life in the airline industry. A forward p/e ratio of 8.9 times may make Aer Lingus look attractive 
compared with Irish neighbour Ryanair (12.8 times) or the UK's EasyJet (9.6 times), but with so much uncertainty, 
only the brave will be buying into airlines any time soon.

There was little response from the Dublin shares market to Fine Gael's historic win with investors more concerned 
with global events, in particular the continued violence in Libya.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 3.64 points to 2,939.71.
As expected, a Fine Gael/Labour coalition government is the most likely outcome following the weekend's election 
results. The parties' stance on economic policies has been set out well before the election, particularly regarding 
potential re-negotiation of the IMF/EU package, so there should not be a pronounced response from markets to the 
election, according to Davy's Conall Mac Coille.
World stocks rose and were on track to post their third straight month of gains, although traders remained wary that 
sustained high oil prices would hurt global growth. The dollar fell to a three-month low on expectations that the 
uncertain outlook, including firmer oil prices driven by political unrest in the oil-producing Middle East and North 
Africa, would keep U.S. monetary policy loose. Oil prices reversed gains to trade slightly weaker, though they have 
gained sharply this month on concerns over supply disruption from the oil-rich region. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 5c to 
E0.90 despite the airline having posted a return to profit last year as it posted pre-tax profits of E30.4m for the year 
ending December 2010. This compared with a loss of E154.8m in 2009. The airline's transatlantic business also 
returned to profit after what it called a difficult year. Aer Lingus said its 2010 profits had been achieved despite 
adverse economic conditions in its core Irish market and significant challenges caused by volcanic ash and 
weather-related disruptions. Shares in Ryanair fell 2c to E3.37. Kingspan has announced results for 2010. 
Revenues for the year rose 6pc year-on-year (yoy) to E1.19bn while trading profits were up 7pc yoy to E72m. Pre-
tax profits of E55.7m are up 7pc yoy while diluted adjusted EPS of 31.6c (our estimate) is up 12pc yoy. End-2010 
net debt stood at E129m (end-H1 2010: E135m) while Kingspan has also declared a second-half dividend of 6c per

largely challenging conditions. Margin erosion in H2 was not as sharp as had been flagged and this is encouraging. 
Indeed, the performance of the pivotal insulated panels business in H2 is a positive (with its margin up to 6.3pc from 
4.8pc in H1)," said analyst, Flor O'Donoghue. Kingspan's shares jumped 36c to E7.00.

The ISEQ shed early losses today to close the session on a high as oil prices eased but with investors still 
concerned with global events, in particular the continued violence in Libya.
The index rose 33.19 points to 2,976.54.
As expected, a Fine Gael/Labour coalition government is the most likely outcome following the weekend's election 
results. The parties' stance on economic policies has been set out well before the election, particularly regarding 
potential re-negotiation of the IMF/EU package, so there should not be a pronounced response from markets to the 
election, according to Davy's Conall Mac Coille.
European shares rose steadily, gaining for the third straight month after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James 
Bullard gave a bullish U.S. outlook, easing investor fears high oil prices would hurt growth. The pan-European 
FTSEurofirst 300 index provisionally closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,169.28 points, up for the second consecutive 
session after a sell-off last week caused by the political unrest in oil-rich Libya. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 4c to E0.91 
despite the airline having posted a return to profit last year as it posted pre-tax profits of E30.4m for the year ending 
December 2010. This compared with a loss of E154.8m in 2009. The airline's transatlantic business also returned 
to profit after what it called a difficult year. Aer Lingus said its 2010 profits had been achieved despite adverse 
economic conditions in its core Irish market and significant challenges caused by volcanic ash and weather-related 
disruptions. "We believe that Aer Lingus continues to look cheap but, as indicated, a fuel-related downgrade is likely 
(we currently assume E62m operating profit in 2011). However, the company still looks attractive on a valuation 
basis and remains in a significant net cash position (E340m)," said Davy analyst, Stephen Furlong. Shares in 
Ryanair fell 2c to E3.37. Kingspan has announced results for 2010. Revenues for the year rose 6pc year-on-year

News In Brief
## Telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien has increased his shareholding in Aer Lingus to almost 3.3 per cent. He has 
raised his holding to 17.6m shares from 15.6 mm. A spokesman for the billionaire says Mr O'Brien has been "a 
staunch supporter of Aer Lingus for many years". It is understood Mr O'Brien has been a shareholder since the 
airline was first floated in 2006. "He believes in the airline and its importance in the context of the Irish economy," 
the spokesman added. According to Bloomberg data, Mr O'Brien is the fourth biggest named shareholder in Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair, the biggest shareholder, has a 29.82 per cent stake, while the Minister for Finance holds a 25.11 
per cent chunk on behalf of the State. The Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Plan owns 12.47 per cent. - Irish

## David Drumm earned more than 10m euros during his period as chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank but paid less 
than 10,000 euros in income tax. Documents filed in Boston as part of Mr Drumm's bankruptcy application there 
show he received income tax rebates in 2004, 2005 and 2006, when he was one of the most highly paid bankers in 
Ireland. In 2007 Mr Drumm was paid 3.27m euros and was the highest paid chief executive of an Irish bank. 
However, he paid just 2,216.94 euros in income tax, according to a Revenue document filed in Boston. - Irish Times

company Hays, looked at the salaries and terms and conditions across 934 positions in seven sectors - accounting 
and finance, IT, banking, financial services, HR, construction and property, insurance and office support. Salaries in 
nearly all of the sectors have levelled off after falling by as much as 30pc in 2009. The survey found that 
accountancy graduates with more than one language have seen their salaries increase by as much as 15pc on

right to offer renewals to all of 123.ie's customers. RSA said it had grown premium income by 7pc last year, out-

Highlight: Ryanair has said it is "very concerned" at the announcement by Aer Lingus of an exceptional provision 
of 32.5m euros for its redundancy and rehiring programme in 2009.
Body
Ryanair has said it is "very concerned" at the announcement by Aer Lingus of an exceptional provision of 32.5m 
euros for tax, interest and penalties on its redundancy and rehiring programme in 2009.
"This payment comes on the back of a still unexplained 25.3m euro gift to the ESOT on the 22nd December last," 
Ryanair says this morning, "and brings to over 57m euros the quantum of Aer Lingus shareholder funds which have 
been paid out to current and former staff over the past three months."
Ryanair alleges that the provision raises a number of very serious questions, to which it says all Aer Lingus 
shareholders are entitled to receive answers.
It lists them as follows: 1.Who in Aer Lingus negotiated this redundancy and rehire programme with government in 
2008 and 2009? 2.Which Ministers, Departments and officials were involved in these discussion/negotiations? 
3.Why did Aer Lingus believe that it had no tax liabilities for the original deal? 4.Was Aer Lingus Director David 
Begg involved in the negotiations or the conclusion of this redundancy and rehire programme? 5. If Mr Begg was 
involved in the discussion, negotiation or conclusion of this redundancy and rehire programme, is his position on the

Ryanair has said it is "very concerned" at the announcement by Aer Lingus of an exceptional provision of 32.5m 
euros for tax, interest and penalties on its redundancy and rehiring programme in 2009.
"This payment comes on the back of a still unexplained 25.3m euro gift to the ESOT on the 22nd December last," 
Ryanair says this morning, "and brings to over 57m euros the quantum of Aer Lingus shareholder funds which have 
been paid out to current and former staff over the past three months."
Ryanair alleges that the provision raises a number of very serious questions, to which it says all Aer Lingus 
shareholders are entitled to receive answers.
It lists them as follows: 1.Who in Aer Lingus negotiated this redundancy and rehire programme with government in 
2008 and 2009? 2.Which Ministers, Departments and officials were involved in these discussion/negotiations? 
3.Why did Aer Lingus believe that it had no tax liabilities for the original deal? 4.Was Aer Lingus Director David 
Begg involved in the negotiations or the conclusion of this redundancy and rehire programme? 5. If Mr Begg was 
involved in the discussion, negotiation or conclusion of this redundancy and rehire programme, is his position on the 
board of Aer Lingus tenable? 6. Why, if this redundancy and rehire programme was agreed with the Irish

Body
Ryanair today said it has submitted a written proposal to the Dublin Airport Authority offering to raise passenger 
numbers through Shannon from the current 300,000 a year to 1.3 million a year.
It said that Ryanair's written offer to DAA boss Declan Collier offers to grow Ryanair's Shannon traffic if Ryanair are 
granted the same discount scheme presently enjoyed by Aer Lingus for its transfer traffic at Dublin Airport.
"We sent a written offer to Declan Collier, the boss of the DAA monopoly, committing to grow by 1 million additional 
passengers at Shannon over the next five years. Ryanair has already proven that it can deliver dramatic new route 
and traffic growth at Shannon, when it has a low cost base. Eventually even the DAA monopoly, or the 
Government, must realise that the way forward for Shannon is low cost access, and Ryanair. They have tried it the 
DAA way for the last year, and made Shannon the biggest failure among Europe's airports, said Ryanair chief, 
Michael O'Leary.
In response, the DAA said it finds both the timing and content of the letter "to be rather peculiar given that the 
300,000 figure is more than 100,000 passengers below Ryanair's current indicated traffic level at Shannon for this 
year and that the one million extra passengers Ryanair refers to would not arise until 2016. "Ryanair's claim of 
earlier today that the terms it has sought are the same as those currently available to Aer Lingus in Dublin is 
completely untrue. As a commercial organisation, DAA does not pay any airlines for the delivery of passengers and 
is unaware of any airport that operates in this manner. Such a notion would be economically unviable for any 
airport. DAA however provides a range of incentives for the delivery of new passengers at our airport, including 
discounts of up to 100pc for new routes, it said. Passenger traffic at Shannon airport fell sharply in 2010 and that 
trend continued in to this year with levels not seen since the early 1990s, according to the latest DAA figures. In 
January, 92,000 passengers passed through the airport, a 37.4 per cent drop on the same month in 2010. This 
figure comes on top of a similarly poor performance at the airport for the full 12 months of 2010 when 1,755,900 
Ryanair offers Shannon 1.3m passengers Ryanair Shannon
passengers used the airport, 37.2 per cent down on the 2,794,563 passengers that used the facility in 2009. 
Shannon has experienced a 52 per cent drop since its peak in 2006, when 3,639,046 passengers used the airport, 
and 2010 passenger numbers were similar to 1996 levels.

Business chiefs call for Irish bail-out rethink

Ireland's leading business organisation and its best known executive have backed calls for a new government to 
demand a renegotiation of the EUR85bn bail-out deal agreed with the European Union and International Monetary 
Fund.
"Until now we would have been fairly bullish about what is happening in the real economy, but if there are further 
calls for state support to be given to the banks then I think our debt ratios will reach a tipping point," said Fergal 
O'Brien, chief economist with Irish Business and Employers Confederation.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the low-cost airline, said a new government would be "absolutely right 
to seek a renegotiation" of the bail-out programme.
In Friday's general election, the centre-right Fine Gael is on course to become the largest party in parliament and is 
likely to form a government with the centre-left Labour party, its traditional coalition ally.
Both parties are committed to seeking a renegotiation of the bail-out to reduce its crippling cost to the Irish taxpayer, 
even while the bondholders who lent to Ireland's broken banks are repaid in full.
"I don't think the renegotiation should be based on the fact that they're lending to us at 6 per cent and they're 
borrowing at 3," Mr O'Leary told the Financial Times in an interview in his Dublin airport offices.
"I think it should be based on the fact the debt that is being run up now by Ireland, Portugal and Spain is going to 
need a European debt restructuring model. The Irish economy simply can't shoulder additional financing charges of 
EUR5bn a year when we're running a fiscal deficit of EUR10bn- EUR15bn."
The EU-IMF deal was the key issue in the last party leaders' television debate on Tuesday night when Eamon 
Gilmore, Labour leader, said the bail-out had created a "straitjacket" for any incoming government.
The new administration was "going to face the biggest mess that any incoming government will face", he said.
Business chiefs call for Irish bail-out rethink
However, Micheál Martin, leader of Fianna Fáil and foreign minister in the outgoing government, said the deal could 
not be renegotiated unilaterally. He said it would require "intelligent diplomacy" to secure a better deal.
Mr O'Leary also said Ireland was "ripe for fairly radical reform of the public sector" and urged the incoming 
government to take "the tough medicine".
He said: "I don't think the business environment will be changed by a change of government, but I think it's going to 
be changed by what I hope will be the tough restructuring reforms imposed by the IMF."
But the International Bank for Economic Co-operation warned the incoming government against any attempt to sell 
state companies, because of concerns that it would receive only fire-sale prices for the assets. The comments are 
seen as a clear warning to Fine Gael, which says it wants to use the proceeds of asset sales to fund a jobs creation 
plan.
Mr O'Brien said it would "not be in the best national interest" to sell assets "at a time when there is a perception out 
there that Ireland is in fire-sale mode".

Mr Kenny on Wednesday unveiled his plan for his first 100 days in office should he become prime minister, saying 
he would force ministers to concentrate on their immediate tasks and end the "circus" of ministerial attendance at 
ceremonies and other events.
"I have seen the circus around the country for the last number of years where day after day plaques are unveiled at 
pump houses and tapes are cut," Mr Kenny said.
He said he would recall Ireland's ambassadors and also all officials for overseas trade bodies who would be 
"extensively and precisely briefed on the new urgency of our marketing position and strategy".

The Irish Business and Employers Confederation has issued a "jobs manifesto" for the first 100 days of an incoming

Irish shares have fallen again this morning for a fourth straight day.
They have tracked a continuing downward trend in Europe as investors fear that a spread of turmoil in Middle East

The ISEQ dipped deeper in to negative territory this morning adding to a steep decline in the previous session, as 
violence in Libya intensified worries about unrest spreading further across the region and sending oil prices soaring.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 7.38 points to 2,949.21.
"Markets are obviously now reflecting world political uncertainty. It's as simple as that," said Richard Jeffrey, chief 
investment officer at Cazenove Capital Management. "The markets have been looking fully valued, and there are 
concerns about interest rates rises and inflation, and companies are saying their margins are not as good as they 
were."
Shares in Europe's airlines were among the biggest losers, hurt by fears over fuel costs as oil prices surged. In 
Dublin, Aer Lingus dropped 1c to E1.00 and Ryanair lost 1c to E3.50. Kerry has reported pre-tax profits of E392.8m 
for the year ending December 2010, up from the E251.9m reported the previous year. Sales in the year increased 
by 9.7pc to E5 billion and the company reported a 5.5pc increase in continuing business volumes. The company's 
trading profit for the year rose by 11.3pc to E470m. Kerry said that strong business volume growth was achieved 
throughout its established and emerging markets. "These results and the FY 2011 outlook firmly establish Kerry 
Group as a growth company with fine prospects. In absolute terms, the results amply demonstrate the rewards of 
Kerry's 'go-to-market' strategy and the strength of its applications technology portfolio," said Davy's Cathal Kenny. 
Kerry's stocks surged by 85c to E26.25. CRH peer, Wienerberger, has reported preliminary results for the fourth 
quarter of 2010. Revenues for the quarter of E401.5m were unchanged on Q4 2009, while EBITDA of E50.3m was 
up 15pc year-on-year (yoy). For 2010 overall, group revenues of E1.74bn were down 4pc yoy while EBITDA rose 
1pc to E210.8m. CRH shares fell 28c to E16.49. FBD will reports its full-year results on March 8th. The insurance 
business is gaining from rate increases and improving claims trends, although weak domestic demand and 
ISEQ dips on oil but Kerry Group soars ISEQ dips
exceptional weather in 2010 are tempering the benefit. In its mid-November statement, FBD reported that it was 
trading ahead of the prior year and modestly ahead of market expectations, primarily as a result of an improved 
underwriting performance. The group raised guidance for operating earnings from 95-100c to 105-110c. Late 2010 
weather may take some of the gloss off the figures, but the impact is unlikely to be material. Reinsurance caps 
freeze related losses at E5m in a seven-day period, while our comparable operating EPS of 97c (+27pc yoy) 
provides a buffer for some 'exceptional' weather losses. Shares in the group jumped 11c to E7.35.

Kerry's stocks surged by 72c to E26.12. CRH peer, Wienerberger, has reported preliminary results for the fourth 
quarter of 2010. Revenues for the quarter of E401.5m were unchanged on Q4 2009, while EBITDA of E50.3m was 
up 15pc year-on-year (yoy). For 2010 overall, group revenues of E1.74bn were down 4pc yoy while EBITDA rose 
1pc to E210.8m. CRH shares fell 36c to E16.41. FBD will reports its full-year results on March 8th. The insurance 
business is gaining from rate increases and improving claims trends, although weak domestic demand and

exceptional weather in 2010 are tempering the benefit. In its mid-November statement, FBD reported that it was 
trading ahead of the prior year and modestly ahead of market expectations, primarily as a result of an improved 
underwriting performance. The group raised guidance for operating earnings from 95-100c to 105-110c. Late 2010 
weather may take some of the gloss off the figures, but the impact is unlikely to be material. Reinsurance caps 
freeze related losses at E5m in a seven-day period, while our comparable operating EPS of 97c (+27pc yoy) 
provides a buffer for some 'exceptional' weather losses. Shares in the group fell 4c to E7.20. Among the small caps, 
Dragon Oil surged 17c to E6.75 as profit soared 49pc in 2010 on higher oil prices and increased production. And 
the Turkmenistan-focused company says it is to pay its maiden full-year dividend. Pre-tax profit jumped to USD 
514.7m, exceeding a consensus of USD 517m by analysts, from USD 345m a year earlier.

RYANAIR is teaming up with publisher Ink to create customised ads on home-printed boarding passes, which target 
fliers based on their travelling routes.
The budget's in-flight magazine publisher, is developing a system that will customise advertising for travellers, 
according to their route and demographic data.
The ads will be printed on Ryanair boarding cards and will target destination and departure points. A Ryanair 
spokesperson said: "Passengers are required to reference their boarding cards on a number of occasions during a 
trip, providing repeat exposure for advertisers."
The revenue from the ads will be used to keep Ryanair airfares low, the company added.
Ryanair makes around a fifth of its revenue from ancillary operations.
It is understood the ads will be more expensive than web based advertising.

Ryanair today announced its first five Vilnius (Lithuania's Capital) routes to Dublin, Barcelona (Girona), London 
(Stansted), Milan (Bergamo) and Rome (Ciampino) from May of this year.
The Irish no-frills airline said it is expanding in Lithuania following the success of its Kaunas base which opened in 
May 2010.
Ryanair's Barcelona (Girona) and Milan (Bergamo) routes will transfer from Kaunas to make way for Ryanair's first 
Greek routes from Kaunas to Rhodes and Kos which were announced recently.
Ryanair's five new Vilnius routes will deliver 250,000 passengers a year and sustain 250 jobs while its Kaunas base 
delivers over 1million passengers annually sustaining over 1,000 local jobs, it said. "Ryanair is pleased to announce 
five new routes from Lithuanian's Capital City, Vilnius, from May 2011. These follow the success of our Kaunas 
base which opened in May 2010. Lithuanian consumers/visitors can now beat the recession and escape Air Baltic's 
high fares by choosing Ryanair's lowest fares and our no fuel surcharge guarantee from Kaunas and Vilnius to 
exciting destinations all over Europe including Greece, Italy and Spain among others. Ryanair's 250,000 
passengers at Vilnius and over 1m passengers p.a. at Kaunas will sustain over 1,250 jobs in the Lithuanian 
economy as Ryanair continues to offer a mix of exciting low fare routes," Stephen McNamara said.

Business leaders working on a proposal for recovery

Section: IRELAND
Length: 738 words
Body
The country has been crying out for a cure for the malaise smothering it and, before Christmas, some of Ireland's 
most influential people came together to offer remedies.
Before the election was called, more than 20 high-profile people from Ireland's business and political spheres 
agreed to contribute to a discussion on economic recovery.
Angela Kerins, chief executive of not-for-profit organisation Rehab, is believed to be one of the main drivers of the 
initiative.
Some who were approached, such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, declined to become directly involved in the 
project.
But others were happy to offer ideas. Sources said a number of informal meetings have taken place in Rehab 
headquarters in Sandymount, Dublin. A meeting aimed at finalising a proposal document was due to take place 
yesterday.
Contributing to the paper are some of the country's most successful business and political minds, including 
telecoms entrepreneur Denis O'Brien, former taoiseach John Bruton and former European commissioner Peter 
Sutherland.
Former Bank of Ireland chief executive Michael Soden, former president of the European Parliament Pat Cox, 
former EU commissioner Ray MacSharry, Glen Dimplex chief executive Sean O'Driscoll and Denis O'Brien's 
business partner, Leslie Buckley, are also understood to have attended meetings.
Dermot Desmond has also been involved with the group.
The document which will emerge from the process has been dubbed 'Blueprint for Recovery'.
Business leaders working on a proposal for recovery
Although the paper was not specifically intended for consideration by an incoming government, it is likely to be of 
interest to the new leaders of the country.
Whether or not any ideas will be adopted by those at the top remains to be seen, but popular opinion will no doubt 
put stock in proposals drawn from people with such proven track records.
Sources have described the formation of the think tank as an effort to make a positive contribution to the debate on 
what we can do to aid economic and political reform. The steps suggested are designed to lead to job creation and 
the date mentioned throughout the discussion process has been 2016.
''Its aim is to propose real and meaningful change to get the country right and to get people back working," said a 
source familiar with the project.
H e said that at the moment, the only plan on the table seemed to be renegotiating Ireland's deal with the EU and 
IMF.
The paper is around 80 pages long and more than half of it has already been agreed. It is understood that it has 
made suggestions on a wide range of subjects, including measures to clean up the banking system.
Long-term solutions for Ireland's funding through the introduction of 30-year bonds has been suggested, along with 
methods of disposing of the country's surplus property.
Other ideas expected to be put forward include the appointment of a minister for competitiveness to act as a chief 
executive of the government.
This person would closely monitor the workings of the government, and chair secretary general meetings of the 
various departments. Clear jobs targets and benchmarks for the government would also be established.
All this could be monitored by this new minister. The suggestion here seems to be that corporate standards be 
applied to the government. Another proposal is for the establishment of a commission on the constitution within 
three months.
The discussions al so touched on the establishment of an SME bank to stimulate lending to business.
Education, tourism, manufacturing and life sciences have also been discussed. The amalgamation of Dublin's 
universities to create a single, world renowned university has been suggested, it is understood.
Other topics likely to be covered in the final document include critical infrastructure, the food sector and tourism.
Suggestions on the latter include reducing the cost of access to the country and reducing the number of airports.
Restoring competitiveness is a top priority.
The country lost 35 per cent of its competitiveness in the decade up to 2008 and, although we have recovered a 
portion of that, there is a belief that more needs to be done.
It is no surprise that the topic of 'real' public sector reform is covered in the document.
The final document to emerge from the discussions is likely to be circulated shortly.
It will no doubt make for interesting reading, given the growing appetite for answers to Ireland's problems - at a time 
when rebuilding the economy seems some way off.

The ISEQ made gains this morning after yesterday's minor losses but was out of step with global markets, which 
moved lower after hitting fresh 30-month highs.
By 12:30, the index was up 18.28 points to 2,983.24.
World markets fell against a background of rising oil prices and new attempts by China to curb its inflation 
pressures. Wall Street looked set to open flat. Brent crude rose close to dollar 103 a barrel as unrest spreading 
across the Middle East fanned fears of a supply disruption in the major oil-producing region. China underlined 
investor concern about rising global inflation, fuelled now by rising oil prices, by raising lenders' required reserves 
by 50 basis points.
Back home, CRH was the biggest gainer with stocks up 30c to E16.67. Data released this week by ARTBA 
(American Road Transportation Builders Association) shows that contract awards for highway and bridges soared 
in January by 51pc on an annual basis (highways +78pc and bridges 4pc). This follows four consecutive months of 
decline and leaves the rolling six-month figure at +1pc (+4pc highways and -7pc bridges). "However, we will be 
watching the data closely in the coming months, to see whether states are pulling back on projects given 
uncertainty over funding levels, as this underpins our cautious view on the US for CRH," said Goodbody 
Stockbrokers' analyst, Robert Eason. In the latest safety update on Elan's MS treatment, Tysabri, released 
yesterday, ten new PML cases were confirmed during January - bringing the total to 95. Eight of these new cases 
occurred in Europe (now totals 52). There have been 38 PML cases to date in the US and five in the rest of the 
world. Twenty (21pc) with PML have died. Shares in Elan fell 12c to E4.86. Airlines in recent months, intensifying in 
recent weeks, have been pushing through fuel surcharges on ticket prices to deal with the soaring oil price. 
Recently, there have been high profile moves from Qantas, BA and Singapore to name but a few, but the US 
carriers have also been at the same thing. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 1c to E1.01 while Ryanair was flat at E3.63.

Moodys has published mortgage arrears data for the securitsation/covered bond pools that it tracks (about E40bn). 
It shows that 1.65pc of Irish mortgages are over 360 days in arrears at end December, up from 1.62pc in November 
and 0.7pc 12 months ago. Mortgages 90 days in arrears are up 8bps in December from November to 5.74pc and 
up from 3.24pc 12 months earlier. In the 90 days arrears category, the highest arrears were recorded by First

The ISEQ made gains this morning after yesterday's minor losses but was out of step with global markets, which 
moved lower after hitting fresh 30-month highs.
By 12:30, the index was up 18.28 points to 2,983.24.
World markets fell against a background of rising oil prices and new attempts by China to curb its inflation 
pressures. Wall Street looked set to open flat. Brent crude rose close to dollar 103 a barrel as unrest spreading 
across the Middle East fanned fears of a supply disruption in the major oil-producing region. China underlined 
investor concern about rising global inflation, fuelled now by rising oil prices, by raising lenders' required reserves 
by 50 basis points.
Back home, CRH was the biggest gainer with stocks up 30c to E16.67. Data released this week by ARTBA 
(American Road Transportation Builders Association) shows that contract awards for highway and bridges soared 
in January by 51pc on an annual basis (highways +78pc and bridges 4pc). This follows four consecutive months of 
decline and leaves the rolling six-month figure at +1pc (+4pc highways and -7pc bridges). "However, we will be 
watching the data closely in the coming months, to see whether states are pulling back on projects given 
uncertainty over funding levels, as this underpins our cautious view on the US for CRH," said Goodbody 
Stockbrokers' analyst, Robert Eason. In the latest safety update on Elan's MS treatment, Tysabri, released 
yesterday, ten new PML cases were confirmed during January - bringing the total to 95. Eight of these new cases 
occurred in Europe (now totals 52). There have been 38 PML cases to date in the US and five in the rest of the 
world. Twenty (21pc) with PML have died. Shares in Elan fell 12c to E4.86. Airlines in recent months, intensifying in 
recent weeks, have been pushing through fuel surcharges on ticket prices to deal with the soaring oil price. 
Recently, there have been high profile moves from Qantas, BA and Singapore to name but a few, but the US 
carriers have also been at the same thing. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 1c to E1.01 while Ryanair was flat at E3.63.

Moodys has published mortgage arrears data for the securitsation/covered bond pools that it tracks (about E40bn). 
It shows that 1.65pc of Irish mortgages are over 360 days in arrears at end December, up from 1.62pc in November 
and 0.7pc 12 months ago. Mortgages 90 days in arrears are up 8bps in December from November to 5.74pc and 
up from 3.24pc 12 months earlier. In the 90 days arrears category, the highest arrears were recorded by First 
Active, followed by EBS and KBC, with the first two leading the stakes in the 360 days arrears as well. Shares in 
Bank of Ireland fell 1c to E0.37 while Irish Life and Permanent was unmoved at E0.94.

World markets fell against a background of rising oil prices and new attempts by China to curb its inflation

collapse of talks between them on airport fees and charges.
Body
The war of words between Ryanair and the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) continued today following the collapse of 
talks between them on airport fees and charges.
Yesterday, the DAA said it offered Ryanair more than E60 million worth of discounts on airport charges to stimulate 
increased traffic into its three Irish airports.
Negotiations between the two companies ended yesterday after what the DAA says was Ryanair's insistence that it 
be paid more than E100 million in discounts, with no guarantee of any additional traffic.
However, Ryanair this morning said DAA Chief Executive, Declan Collier, refused to extend the DAA's current 
traffic incentive scheme. It said that the DAA offered Ryanair a discount scheme under which the growth discounts 
would be given at Dublin only after traffic losses in Cork and Shannon were made up. The airline said that only 
40pc of the discounts generated by Ryanair's traffic growth would be awarded to Ryanair, whereas 60pc of 
Ryanair's growth discounts would be given to Aer Lingus and other airlines at Dublin, even as they continue to cut 
traffic. "It's extraordinary that the DAA, having presided over two years of traffic collapses during which Dublin 
Airport's traffic has fallen from 23.5m to just 18.5m per annum, has now rejected Ryanair's offer of 4m passenger 
growth which would generate up to 4,000 jobs and more than E2bn for Dublin and Irish tourism. The DAA, which is 
presently giving discounts to Aer Lingus, despite the fact that Aer Lingus' traffic is in decline, but have this morning 
refused to extend these discounts to Ryanair because Mr Collier claims that Ryanair's growth would be 'too 
expensive' for the DAA," said Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. "It is absurd even for the DAA, to propose that if Ryanair 
delivers 4m additional passengers, 60pc of these growth discounts will be allocated to Ryanair's competitor airlines 
at Dublin Airport and even these growth discounts will be further reduced by traffic declines which the DAA preside 
over at Cork and Shannon airports. The DAA want Ryanair's growth to subsidise their traffic falls at Cork and 
DAA/ Ryanair war of words escalates DAA Ryanair
Shannon, and they also want to allocate 60pc of Ryanair's growth discounts at Dublin Airport to Aer Lingus, Aer 
Arann and other non-growth airlines."

Body
A French city has said it is ending the subsidies it pays Ryanair to maintain flights there because the Irish low-cost 
airline's demands are "intolerable" and amount to blackmail.
The chamber of commerce in Pau, which runs the southwestern city's airport, has informed Ryanair of its decision 
"not to pay another penny in fees," said chamber official Christian Cloux.
Ryanair had asked Pau to hike its subsidies from 1.4m euros a year to 1.5m if it wants to maintain flights to Britain, 
Belgium and Paris, he said, calling the demand "financial blackmail."
"The situation had become intolerable," he said. Cloux said it was now up to the airline to decide if it wanted to 
maintain its routes or not, and added that low-cost airlines CityJet and Flybe were starting up routes from Pau 
without being promised any subsidies. He said that if Ryanair services from Pau cease when its contract expires in 
April, this could cause a "small drop in traffic" but this would be "quickly compensated" for by other services and 
would not impact on jobs. Ryanair often pressures regional authorities to provide financial aid in return for its 
continued presence. The airline said earlier this month that it would reopen most of the routes from the French city 
Marseille which it shut in protest at being prosecuted over its employment practices. Ryanair in January abandoned 
its base at Marseille airport in protest over French prosecutors' refusal to drop charges against it for hiring workers 
on Irish contracts, which they said breached labour laws. The company cut 13 routes from Marseille to destinations 
in Europe and Morocco, served by four aircraft based in the French city. But it continued to run 10 routes to and 
from the airport by planes based elsewhere. But Ryanair later said it would reopen routes and get around the court 
ruling by not basing its planes in Marseille on a permanent basis and by regularly changing the pilots and air crew 
working on the reopened routes. (c) Reuters

Body
The ISEQ, after two days of flat trading, slipped back in to negative territory this morning as oil touched USD104 a 
barrel.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 8.47 points to 2,980.61.
European shares were flat after hitting 29-month highs in the previous session, with falls in industrial goods firms 
offset by gains in food stocks after upbeat results from Nestle.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was up just 0.03 percent at 1,186.49 points, after gaining 
for the last four sessions and closing at a 29-month high on Wednesday. "Many people are still optimistic about the 
market because the global economy is doing well, and earnings for large U.S. companies have been quite good," 
said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity markets strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn. London crude prices have 
extended their gains overnight to hold at 2- year highs of more than USD 104 a barrel, as fresh Israel-Iran tension 
fed spreading unrest in the Middle East and stoked fears of a disruption of oil flows in the region. US oil also 
continued its rally, rising above USD 85 a barrel, after industry data showed crude inventories rose less than 
expected last week. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E1.03 while Ryanair stocks fell 3c to E3.70. DCC has agreed 
a deal to buy Pace Fuelcare Ltd, a British oil distribution business, from MRH, for E27.7m. The acquisition is still 
subject to clearance from the UK Office of Fair Trading. In its financial year ended September 2010, Pace sold 515 
million litres of fuel to independent retail petrol stations and a broad range of commercial, industrial, agricultural and 
domestic customers in the UK. DCC's shares dropped 6c to E22.35. Healthcare services company United Drug has 
said it has made a very good start to the financial year with all divisions trading well with especially strong growth in 
its US business. In a trading update, the company said that group revenues and profits for the three months to the 
end of December are ahead of last year and company expectations. It noted continued strong cash flow generation 
and said that over 60pc of profits are being generated outside of Ireland. The firm's shares fell 2c to E2.20.

expected last week. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E1.03 while Ryanair stocks fell 3c to E3.70. DCC has agreed 
a deal to buy Pace Fuelcare Ltd, a British oil distribution business, from MRH, for E27.7m. The acquisition is still 
subject to clearance from the UK Office of Fair Trading. In its financial year ended September 2010, Pace sold 515 
million litres of fuel to independent retail petrol stations and a broad range of commercial, industrial, agricultural and 
domestic customers in the UK. DCC's shares dropped 6c to E22.35. Healthcare services company United Drug has 
said it has made a very good start to the financial year with all divisions trading well with especially strong growth in 
its US business. In a trading update, the company said that group revenues and profits for the three months to the 
end of December are ahead of last year and company expectations. It noted continued strong cash flow generation 
and said that over 60pc of profits are being generated outside of Ireland. The firm's shares fell 2c to E2.20.

The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) claims it has offered Ryanair more than E60 million worth of discounts on airport 
charges to stimulate increased traffic into its three Irish airports.
Negotiations between the two companies ended today after what the DAA says was Ryanair's insistence that it be 
paid more than E100 million in discounts, with no guarantee of any additional traffic.
Ryanair also wanted to be paid more than E10 million in discounts for existing passengers at Dublin Airport, the 
DAA says.
"The Ryanair proposal would have seen the airline potentially being financially rewarded for reducing traffic at Cork 
and Shannon airports and transferring it to Dublin Airport," the DAA statemetn said. "DAA initially tabled a series of 
incentives that would have given Ryanair more than E50 million in discounted airport charges if Ryanair delivered 
incremental growth of four million passengers at Dublin Airport over the next five years. DAA subsequently 
indicated its willingness to improve its offer and to provide Ryanair with more than E60 million in incentives if it 
delivered incremental passenger growth," it said. "Regrettably, Ryanair has refused to accept this proposal and 
instead continues to demand E100 million in subsidies with no guarantee of any extra traffic for the airport or for the 
country." "We have offered Ryanair generous discounts worth more than E60 million if the airline delivers the new 
passengers that it claims it can," said DAA Chief Executive Declan Collier. "Our aim is to encourage additional 
passenger traffic for Dublin Airport and for the country as a whole, but Ryanair was unable to provide any guarantee 
that the traffic it would deliver under its proposal would be additional," Mr Collier added. "Agreeing to the Ryanair 
proposal would mean that DAA could potentially pay Ryanair E100 million in incentives for no overall passenger 
growth and no extra inbound tourists," according to Mr Collier. "DAA was therefore unable to accede to Ryanair's 
unrealistic and unsustainable proposal," he added. "Our incentives are structured to ensure that airlines cannot 
qualify for tens of millions of euro in discounts unless they deliver new passengers. But Ryanair gave no

commitment in relation to how many of its projected four million passengers would be additional traffic or what 
percentage of the traffic would be inbound tourists." Ryanair also wanted to be paid more than E10 million in 
subsidies for existing passengers, despite the fact that DAA's incentive schemes are designed to stimulate traffic 
growth. DAA has a range of generous incentive schemes to stimulate growth at its three Irish airports, which gives 
discounts of up to 100pc on the company's competitive airport charges for incremental growth and new routes. The 
company will continue to consider proposals from any airline that offers incremental growth on a sustainable basis.

Body
Ryanair today officially opened its second engineering hangar at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, saying the 200 new 
jobs would have gone to Dublin only for the "failures" of the outgoing Government.
This facility which was officially opened by Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, has cost over £8m to build and 
will sustain 200 new engineering jobs in the Scottish airport.
"These high paid engineering jobs were more of the jobs that were lost by the Fianna Fail Government, who 
rejected Ryanair's offers in early 2010 to create up to 600 jobs in Dublin Airport's Hangar 6 facility," the airline said.
"Rather than support Ryanair's job creation in North County Dublin, the Fianna Fail Government, led by ministerial 
failures Noel Dempsey (Transport) and Mary Coughlan (Enterprise) stood idly by while the DAA monopoly did a 
deal to lease the Hangar 6 facility to Aer Lingus, for its new Headquarters building." "Over 12 months later, Aer 
Lingus has still not created one new engineering job in Hangar 6, while Ryanair has created over 500 new 
engineering jobs in its new maintenance hangars in Frankfurt Hahn and Glasgow Prestwick airports. Yet again the 
incompetence of the Dept of Transport and the Dept of Enterprise has seen high paid engineering jobs, which were 
offered here at Dublin Airport, exported to Germany and Scotland, because Fianna Fail Ministers would prefer to 
support and protect the high cost DAA airport monopoly, rather than support and protect job creation in North 
County Dublin," Ryanair said in a statement today. "The opening of Ryanair's second maintenance hangar in 
Glasgow Prestwick is a further significant investment by Ryanair in our safety and maintenance, which operate to 
the highest international standards. We are delighted that Ryanair will create up to 200 new engineering jobs in our 
second hangar in Glasgow Prestwick, and we look forward to opening our new hangar facility in Frankfurt Hahn 
Airport shortly. The tragedy of today's development in Scotland is that these jobs could have been allocated to an 
employment blackspot in North County Dublin, where SRT Aviation made over 600 aircraft engineers redundant 
when they closed their Hangar 6 facility. This facility is now used by Aer Lingus for Head Office and no new 
200 Ryanair jobs for Glasgow not Dublin; Ryanair jobs
maintenance business or engineering jobs have been created by Aer Lingus in Hangar 6," said Ryanair's Stephen 
McNamara. "We hope that the electorate of North County Dublin will remember the Hangar 6 controversy, and the 
failure of Fianna Fail Ministers to protect engineering jobs in North County Dublin, during the forthcoming election. 
We also hope the new Government will break up the failed DAA monopoly, which has done untold damage to Irish 
tourism and Irish jobs with its high cost, empty second terminal and its failure to work with Ryanair to win these high 
paid maintenance jobs in North County Dublin."

This facility which was officially opened by Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, has cost over £8m to build and 
will sustain 200 new engineering jobs in the Scottish airport.
"These high paid engineering jobs were more of the jobs that were lost by the Fianna Fail Government, who 
rejected Ryanair's offers in early 2010 to create up to 600 jobs in Dublin Airport's Hangar 6 facility," the airline said.
"Rather than support Ryanair's job creation in North County Dublin, the Fianna Fail Government, led by ministerial 
failures Noel Dempsey (Transport) and Mary Coughlan (Enterprise) stood idly by while the DAA monopoly did a 
deal to lease the Hangar 6 facility to Aer Lingus, for its new Headquarters building." "Over 12 months later, Aer 
Lingus has still not created one new engineering job in Hangar 6, while Ryanair has created over 500 new 
engineering jobs in its new maintenance hangars in Frankfurt Hahn and Glasgow Prestwick airports. Yet again the 
incompetence of the Dept of Transport and the Dept of Enterprise has seen high paid engineering jobs, which were 
offered here at Dublin Airport, exported to Germany and Scotland, because Fianna Fail Ministers would prefer to 
support and protect the high cost DAA airport monopoly, rather than support and protect job creation in North 
County Dublin," Ryanair said in a statement today. "The opening of Ryanair's second maintenance hangar in 
Glasgow Prestwick is a further significant investment by Ryanair in our safety and maintenance, which operate to 
the highest international standards. We are delighted that Ryanair will create up to 200 new engineering jobs in our 
second hangar in Glasgow Prestwick, and we look forward to opening our new hangar facility in Frankfurt Hahn 
Airport shortly. The tragedy of today's development in Scotland is that these jobs could have been allocated to an 
employment blackspot in North County Dublin, where SRT Aviation made over 600 aircraft engineers redundant 
when they closed their Hangar 6 facility. This facility is now used by Aer Lingus for Head Office and no new 
200 Ryanair jobs for Glasgow not Dublin Ryanair jobs
maintenance business or engineering jobs have been created by Aer Lingus in Hangar 6," said Ryanair's Stephen 
McNamara. "We hope that the electorate of North County Dublin will remember the Hangar 6 controversy, and the 
failure of Fianna Fail Ministers to protect engineering jobs in North County Dublin, during the forthcoming election. 
We also hope the new Government will break up the failed DAA monopoly, which has done untold damage to Irish 
tourism and Irish jobs with its high cost, empty second terminal and its failure to work with Ryanair to win these high 
paid maintenance jobs in North County Dublin."

Body
Ryanair today said it will not now go ahead with a major expansion at its Barcelona/Girona base because of what it 
said was the Spanish authorities "backtracking" on a deal between them.
The expansion at the airport was originally announced in December 2010 but Ryanair today said that the new 
Catalan government has refused to honour its agreement.
"In December 2010 Ryanair and the Government of Catalonia reached agreement on a five year extension of its 
base operation at Girona Airport under which Ryanair agreed to base 11 aircraft at Girona, operate 64 routes and 
deliver 4m passengers p.a. which would sustain up to 4,000 jobs in and around Girona Airport," Ryanair said.
"However, the new government has refused to honour the agreement despite being consulted on it by the outgoing 
government." Ryanair is to reduce its operations from the airport by five aircraft, close 18 (of 64) routes and reduce 
frequencies on 17 other routes, the airline said. The move will result in the loss of over 100 weekly flights, which will 
see Ryanair's Girona traffic fall from 4m to 2.3m per annum, which it said will cause the loss of up to 1,700 local 
jobs.

Germany's Federal Court of Justice.
The country's highest court have ruled that Lufthansa and Air Berlin can sue in the German civil courts over what 
the carriers argue are subsidies to Ryanair in the form of lower airport charges at Frankfurt-Hahn and Lubeck.
Lower courts had ruled the airlines could not challenge the airport charges in a civil case.
The European Commission is already investigating allegations that Ryanair enjoys subsidies at the German 
airports. The Federal Court ruled competing airlines could seek repayment of money "if a state-run airport grants 
aid to an airline before it has been cleared under EU rules". Ryanair said it never sought or accepted state aid. (c)

Body
Ryanair today slammed Fianna Fail's election promises on tourism saying that the party that did such damage to 
the industry can't be trusted to fix it.
Ryanair condemned Fianna Fail for presiding over two successive years of collapse in Irish air traffic and tourism. 
Traffic at the three main Irish airports had collapsed from 30m in 2008 to less than 23m in 2010 (down 25pc) and 
continues to fall because Fianna Fail's mismanagement and its monopoly protection policies have made Ireland a 
high cost, uncompetitive tourist destination.
"Fianna Fail can't be trusted with Irish tourism. They welched on their previous election promises to break up the 
DAA monopoly and Fianna Fail ministers have in recent years destroyed Irish tourism by introducing a tourist tax 
and ordering the Regulator to rubberstamp the DAA monopoly's inflation busting price increases, which have

"It is remarkable, at a time when thousands of jobs have been lost in Irish tourism and mass emigration has 
returned, that the DAA monopoly have failed to respond to Ryanair's written offer last December to grow 4m 
passengers annually at Dublin Airport, which would create over 4,000 new jobs in North County Dublin. On the 8th 
February, almost 8 weeks later, Ryanair still haven't had a response from the DAA to the only large volume traffic 
growth offer they've received for summer 2011. The DAA have been protected by successive Fianna Fail ministers 
who don't care about Irish tourism or Irish jobs. We hope that the next Government will break up this failed airport 
monopoly as previous Fianna Fail Governments promised to, but ultimately lied to the Irish people."

Ryanair today slammed Fianna Fail's election promises on tourism saying that the party that did such damage to 
the industry can't be trusted to fix it.
Ryanair condemned Fianna Fail for presiding over two successive years of collapse in Irish air traffic and tourism. 
Traffic at the three main Irish airports had collapsed from 30m in 2008 to less than 23m in 2010 (down 25pc) and 
continues to fall because Fianna Fail's mismanagement and its monopoly protection policies have made Ireland a 
high cost, uncompetitive tourist destination.
"Fianna Fail can't be trusted with Irish tourism. They welched on their previous election promises to break up the 
DAA monopoly and Fianna Fail ministers have in recent years destroyed Irish tourism by introducing a tourist tax 
and ordering the Regulator to rubberstamp the DAA monopoly's inflation busting price increases, which have 
destroyed Irish tourism," said CEO Michael O'Leary.

Highlight: Ryanair paid 3.5m euro last month to the Dublin Airport Authority to settle a legal action relating to the 
breach of a five-year contract with Shannon airport on passenger charges.
Body
News In Brief
## Ryanair paid 3.5m euro last month to the Dublin Airport Authority to settle a legal action relating to the breach of 
a five-year contract with Shannon airport on passenger charges. It is understood that the airport authority had 
sought about 5m euros in damages from Ryanair, but accepted the lower amount in an out of court settlement. 
Ryanair has also agreed to pay the airport authority's legal costs, which are thought to amount to several hundred 
thousand euro. The action related to a five-year discount deal on passenger charges between Ryanair and 
Shannon that was agreed in November 2004. It paid between 1 and 2 euro per person - in return for carrying an 
agreed number of passengers. But it failed to hits its target in year four and announced in February 2009 that it was 
scaling back its operations at Shannon. - Irish Times
## Irish banks are paying an interest rate of less than 3pc on the 51bn euros of 'emergency liquidity assistance' that 
has been sanctioned for them by the Central Bank of Ireland. Several informed sources confirmed the interest rate 
in recent days, and also revealed that the ELA is typically for a maximum term of seven days. There is an "explicit" 
government guarantee surrounding all ELA lending, so if the banks can't repay the cash, the State will have to. It is 
the first time any of the terms of the ELA have been made public. All sources asked to remain anonymous, 
stressing the strict confidentiality surrounding emergency liquidity operations. - Irish Independent
## There are 110 senior managers in the HSE earning more than 100,000 euros a year, according to official 
figures. The new figures relate exclusively to senior administrative and managerial staff in the HSE and do not 
include hospital consultants or other medical personnel who are receiving more than 200,000 euros a year in some 
cases. The figures also take account of the pay cuts of 10-15 per cent introduced by the Government last year for 
senior grades in the public service as well as the pension levy introduced in 2009. - Irish Times ## A Cork company 
which provides online education and entertainment for kids, aged between five and 12 years of age, is planning to 
Roundup: Ryanair in E3.5m payout to DAA Ryanair Payout
increase its number of employees from 16 to 42 by the end of the year. Most of the jobs will be in Cork and Poland. 
Caped Koala Studio has developed an online 3D virtual world called Pora Ora - www.poraora.com - which 
combines games, education and social networking. The firm which is headquartered ion West Cork Technology 
Park also has offices in London and Poland. Its aim is to have as many as 30m users within three years, according 
to company founder Neil Gallagher. - Evening Echo ## Repossession orders granted by the courts have risen 
almost six-fold since the peak of the property boom. Figures released by the Courts Service show that the number 
of orders granted by the High Court and Circuit Courts for the repossession of lands and premises were at their 
highest last year, a figure that is set to rise as lenders increase their interest rates. The vast majority of 
repossession orders granted in the courts are for residential properties, with some 263 of the 306 properties seized 
by the banks in the Circuit Court last year granted on foot of defaults on home loans. Although subprime lenders 
such as Start Mortgages have so far dominated High Court repossession actions, taking up some half of all cases, 
mainstream lenders such as Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Nationwide and EBS are now highly active in both the 
superior courts. - Irish Independent ## The Labour Court has issued a significant ruling on compensation for 
medical laboratory scientists in the public service who are set to lose up to 15,000 euros a year due to reforms 
under the Croke Park Agreement. In future, scientists will receive an overtime rate of time and a sixth between 5pm 
and 8pm - a lower rate than previously. The 'fee per item' system will be abolished and replaced with an hourly 
overtime rate of USD 47.50. In a year's time, staff will receive a compensatory lump sum worth one and a half times 
their actual loss of annual earnings. - RTE ## AIB has announced plans yesterday to adjust the ratio of its US 
shares - known as American Depositary Shares (ADSs) - to ordinary shares in order to comply with the New York 
Stock Exchange's (NYSE's) listing standards. Under the new ratio, one ADS will represent 10 ordinary shares, 
rather than two shares as is currently the case. This follows notification by the NYSE that the bank's ADS line was 
considered "below criteria" under its continued listing standards, as its average closing price was less than dollar 1 
over a 30-day trading period. In a statement to the Irish Stock Exchange, the bank said it was making the change 
"to maintain an appropriate price range. - Irish Times

A bout of profit taking on key stocks sent the ISEQ back below the 3,000 level this morning after a four-day rally on 
the back of renewed global optimism.
By 12:30, the index had fallen by 16.03 points to 2,995.78.
European stocks and oil prices turned lower today after China raised interest rates for the second time in just over a 
month, intensifying its fight against inflation. Recent strong manufacturing and services sector surveys around the 
world and a fall in the U.S. unemployment rate point to sustained momentum in the global recovery, while China's 
latest move is seen as proactively tackling inflation problems.
Back home, shares in Elan surged 23c to E5.29 after it reported operating profits, before other charges and gains, 
for the first time since 2001. Revenues for the 12 months to the end of December rose by 5pc to dollar 1.2 billion, 
led by an 18pc increase in revenues from its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Sales of the MS drug hit dollar 851.5m 
for the full year from dollar 724.3m in 2009. The number of patients using the drug worldwide rose by 17pc to about 
56,000. In response to media speculation, Bank of Ireland (BKIR) has issued a statement confirming that it is 
discussing a number of structures with the state to meet its incremental Core Tier 1 capital requirements of E2.2bn 
by February 28th 2011. The bank has already raised E700m equity towards this target through voluntary debt 
management. A recently announced offer for CAD notes would, assuming a 50pc take-up, generate circa E60m - 
leaving a residual E1.44bn to be raised by the end of the month deadline. Shares in the bank fell 2c to E0.39. Irish 
Life and Permanent dropped 1c to E0.98. Ryanair paid E3.5m last month to the Dublin Airport Authority to settle a 
legal action relating to the breach of a five-year contract with Shannon airport on passenger charges, according to 
reports. It is understood that the airport authority had sought about E5m in damages from Ryanair, but accepted the 
lower amount in an out of court settlement. Shares in the airline fell 1c to E3.71. Kerry will report full-year results on 
February 22nd. Davy forecast revenues of E4.87bn (+7.7pc), EBITA (core profits) of E466m (+10.4pc) and adjusted 
Profit taking sends ISEQ below 3,000; ISEQ Falls
earnings per share of 191.1c (+14.8pc). Year-on-year EBITA growth is evident across both of Kerry's divisions - 
Ingredients and Flavours (+14.4pc) and Consumer Foods (+7pc). Strong cash generation continues to be a key 
feature of the Kerry model with net debt/EBITDA expected to fall to 1.9x (the lowest level since 2003), the broker 
said.

A bout of profit taking on key stocks sent the ISEQ back below the 3,000 level this morning after a four-day rally on 
the back of renewed global optimism.
By 12:30, the index had fallen by 16.03 points to 2,995.78.
European stocks and oil prices turned lower today after China raised interest rates for the second time in just over a 
month, intensifying its fight against inflation. Recent strong manufacturing and services sector surveys around the 
world and a fall in the U.S. unemployment rate point to sustained momentum in the global recovery, while China's 
latest move is seen as proactively tackling inflation problems.
Back home, shares in Elan surged 23c to E5.29 after it reported operating profits, before other charges and gains,

Everyone knows that Ryanair charges ridiculous fees. And finally, some people decided to fight back - though 
literally fighting back probably wasn't a good idea.
This all happened on a Ryanair flight from the Canary Islands to Belgium. The plane was packed with 168 
passengers, 104 of which were students from Belgium.
One of the student tried to board the plane with a piece of carry-on luggage that was oversized. The Ryanair staff 
demanded that the student pay a gate bag fee, but the student refused.
And that's when his classmates started a mutiny. The exact details are sketchy, but what we do know is that a huge 
fight broke out, forcing the police to evacuate the plane. No one was arrested, but since all 104 students weren't 
allowed to re-board their flight, they had to remain on the island of Lanzarote overnight. However, since all the 
students were broke, the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stepped in and demanded Ryanair fly the students 
back. (c) Reuters

Having failed to reach a deal to buy 200 new planes from either Boeing or Airbus, Ryanair has shocked the aircraft 
market by saying it is considering buying cheap Chinese or Russian jets instead.
After Boeing talks broke down over the details of delivery pricing, Ryanair said it would instead focus on maximising 
its profits for distribution to shareholders.
While there is "no detailed engagement at the moment", Ryanair deputy CEO Michael Cawley says: "We're talking 
to everybody - the Russians and the Chinese as well."
Cawley insists that these alternative suppliers could be a viable option for Ryanair: "Why wouldn't we? At the right 
price it makes perfect sense to buy, so long as it is fuel efficient. We are not wedded to any aircraft manufacturer." 
He reiterates that Ryanair will not expand beyond 300 aircraft if it does not find an attractive enough deal. Ryanair 
has a further 25 aircraft due for delivery. Its net fleet after disposals will total 299 aircraft by March 2013. Last 
December, Ryanair announced the breakdown of talks with US aircraft giant Boeing on the mammoth deal involving 
200 new 737-800s. Although both sides appeared to have agreed on price, O'Leary blamed the breakdown on 
Boeing's refusal to ''incorporate some other terms and conditions from our existing agreement into this new aircraft 
order''. ''Ryanair has made clear to Boeing that we will not order aircraft if we believe that either the pricing or the 
other contractual terms and conditions will be inferior to those which we currently enjoy, as this would not be a wise 
or sensible use of shareholders' funds," he said. Instead, he looked set to carry out his threat to use the cash that 
would have gone to Boeing in other ways. He reiterated previous hints that the airline would change its strategy 
from one of adding new planes and more routes to one of focusing on generating cash from existing operations, 
using surplus cash to fund share buybacks or even pay dividends for the first time in Ryanair's history.

Ryanair 's recent bumpy ride does not faze its investors
Ryanair's recent bumpy ride does not faze its investors

Section: THE MARKET

Ryanair reported losses of more than  10 million for its third quarter last week, but investors took the news well, as 
the airline is seen as being well positioned to deliver this year.
The industry has had a bumpy ride lately, with the bad weather in December meaning 3,000 Ryanair flights were 
grounded in the quarter. But consistent fuel hedging by the airline, as well as microscopic cost control, should 
ensure that Ryanair continues on an upward course.
The airline's share price has been seen as taking an unfair hit in recent months due to its Irish connections, as 
investors shy away from stock connected with the troubled economy.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary addressed this in a call with analysts last week, pointing out that traffic originating 
from Ireland had fallen from more than 20 per cent to less than 10 per cent in recent months.
''We have been surprised at the extent to which the negative commentary on the Irish economy has clouded some 
people's judgment of Ryanair's future growth and profitability.
''Ryanair has very little exposure to the Irish economy," he said. ''We do, however, believe that Irish tourism is ripe 
for growth, given the increased competitiveness in the sector over the last 18 months.'' However, O'Leary said the 
new government would have an important role to play in fostering this potential.
Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said that the results illustrated the deliverability of Ryanair's business model, 
including the fact that it was the undoubted cost leader in the sector. ''Consistent hedging now leaves it with one of 
the best fuel-hedging positions in the sector," he said.
He said there was an upside potential on the company's revenue. Potential kickers come from limited competitor 
capacity and competitor fuel surcharge rises, as well as new routes from bases which generate better revenue such 
as Barcelona.
Ryanair 's recent bumpy ride does not faze its investors
Also, the likely absence of a substantial ash cloud this year should boost the comparisons with figures from last 
year.
There is an expectation that very strong future cash generation will allow the possibility of generous cash returns to 
shareholders. ''In summary, we think the stock can deliver returns even in a high fuel price, bumpy recovery 
environment," said Furlong.
Bloxham said that Ryanair's share price could reach 480c as the year progressed because of improving profits, 
hedged fuel protects and good cash flows. The share was trading around 375c last Friday.
''A potential second  500 million special dividend and a 480c share price implies a 40 per cent total shareholder 
return is plausible from current levels," said analyst Joe Gill.

Ryanair ordered to drop misleading ad

Ryanair has been ordered not to repeat an ad offering cheap flights to Legoland in Denmark while the attraction is 
closed for the winter.
The low-fares airline ran a press ad in Britain offering ''family fun in Denmark'' from November to January, and 
suggested visiting Legoland Billund.
But a complainant told the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in Britain that the Legoland resort had limited 
opening between November and January, and the theme park was entirely closed.
The ASA noted that part of Legoland Billund resort was open for three weekends in November and the first 
weekend of December, but after this, the whole resort was closed until March.
Ryanair, which is headed by chief executive Michael O'Leary, said it ran the ad in cooperation with Visit Denmark, 
which supplied the copy, but Visit Denmark said the copy of the ad it approved did not include the text ''travel 
November-January''.
''The text implied that, if consumers visited Denmark during those three months, the attractions listed would be fully 
available to them," said the ASA. ''Because this was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading."

Highlight: Economy Watch
Body
With few official statistics released over the week, Economy Watch had to fall back on anecdotal evidence from 
surveys to get a feel for the nation's direction.
And what a week it was. Two surveys underscored two similar messages; that growth in the last quarter of 2010 
may not have been as weak as official numbers suggest, and that prices are rising so quickly that   monetary 
policymakers may not be able to ignore the flashing lights much longer.
A survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector - which even the official data confirm is seeing strong 
growth - hit a record high in January, with new orders growing at the fastest rate on record. Better still, employment 
is rising smartly and export orders are near their best levels since the survey began in 1995, as the prospects for 
companies with customers abroad outshine those dependent on domestic markets.
J ohnson Matthey would not be surprised. The maker of catalytic converters for vehicles said that demand for new 
cars in China had boosted profits.
Mitie, the outsourcing firm, said bad weather had hit its profits and, incidentally, that it was looking to acquire 
businesses abroad.
Perhaps it is no wonder, then, that UK r etail investors are pumping record amounts into global funds; these now 
account for their largest proportion of retail holdings since the early 1990s.
Growth prospects may look better overseas, even though dividends on UK shares are expected to show double-
digit rises this year. Even then, these will be lower than 2007 and 2008.
Meanwhile, a survey of purchasing managers in the services industry - which official data showed to be weak in the 
fourth quarter - contradicted all expectations and revealed reasonably strong expansion in January.
Activity on the rise, but so are prices
However, both purchasing manager surveys showed that the prices of the goods businesses buy and what they 
charge their customers are rising at practically the fastest rates on record as a raft of companies, from Ryanair to 
Unilever , reported that their profits were being hit by rising commodity prices. The culprits were aircraft fuel and 
food oils, with global food prices hitting a high this week.
British house prices fell a little in January and the Bank of England said that the number of home loans in December 
fell much more than it had expected.
Carpetright said it was the victim of rising prices and a weak housing market when it issued a profits warning.
Car sales in January were down from those in 2010 when the scrappage scheme was operating, but private sales 
fell more sharply, suggesting consumers have little appetite for expensive items.
Sales at John Lewis , emporium for the middle classes, said sales were soft for the second week running.
Overall, Economy Watch is encouraged by signs that activity is rising on many fronts, and is hoping that the 
momentum builds. The problem is that prices are rising, too.

The ISEQ rally took inspiration from a global rebound in stocks today amid renewed evidence of a stronger 
recovery and ahead of key US jobs data.
By 12:30, the index had climbed 41.46 points to 2,979.23.
World share prices rose while bonds fell as investors positioned for the possibility of strong U.S. jobs data, which 
would bolster the view of a recovering global economy and further boost riskier assets. Such speculation boosted 
demand for U.S. shares, which were expected to open higher, while copper prices hovered near a record peak of 
dollar 10,000 hit the day before. Oil prices were poised for a second straight week of gains on concerns over 
political unrest in Egypt, where chaos has underscored volatility in the Middle East and North Africa, which together 
produce more than a third of the world's oil.
Aer Lingus shares rose 3c to E1.06 with flights starting to return to normal following a resolution of the three-week-
old dispute between cabin crew and management. The IMPACT trade union - which represents cabin crew - has 
agreed to suspend industrial action, pending the outcome of a binding Labour Relations Commission arbitration on

The ISEQ rally took inspiration from a global rebound in stocks today amid renewed evidence of a stronger 
recovery and ahead of key US jobs data.
By 12:30, the index had climbed 41.46 points to 2,979.23.
World share prices rose while bonds fell as investors positioned for the possibility of strong U.S. jobs data, which 
would bolster the view of a recovering global economy and further boost riskier assets. Such speculation boosted 
demand for U.S. shares, which were expected to open higher, while copper prices hovered near a record peak of 
dollar 10,000 hit the day before. Oil prices were poised for a second straight week of gains on concerns over 
political unrest in Egypt, where chaos has underscored volatility in the Middle East and North Africa, which together 
produce more than a third of the world's oil.
Aer Lingus shares rose 3c to E1.06 with flights starting to return to normal following a resolution of the three-week-
old dispute between cabin crew and management. The IMPACT trade union - which represents cabin crew - has 
agreed to suspend industrial action, pending the outcome of a binding Labour Relations Commission arbitration on 
two outstanding issues. Ryanair stocks climbed 9c to E3.78. Banks put in a lacklustre performance. The country's

agreed to suspend industrial action, pending the outcome of a binding Labour Relations Commission arbitration on

have been solid volume growth and strong pricing momentum, the broker said. Shares in Smurfit Kappa rose 7c to

The ISEQ rebounded from two days of losses this morning as investors around Europe re-focussed on some strong 
economic figures and good corporate results.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 43.06 points to 2,895.87.
Investors shifted their focus from Middle East turmoil to concentrate on improved economic data and corporate 
results today, lifting global stocks. Wall Street looked set to join in and open higher. Inflation expectations boosted 
the euro, helping drive the dollar to a 12-week low against a group of other currencies. The price of oil, the most 
sensitive indicator of market unease about Egypt, eased, although Brent crude remained a few cents above dollar 
100 a barrel.
"Ryanair's best-in-class model continues to deliver, making it a standout investment amongst the airlines," said 
Davy's Stephen Furlong. "For FY 2012, we assume net income of E454.1m, or 30.5c, which we think is realistic at 
this time of year and given where fuel is currently. This would imply that the airline broadly passing through the fuel 
headwind and allowing for some volume growth. This puts the stock on 12x P/E and 6.4x EV/EBITDAR (our DCF 
comes to E5.60). In summary, we think the stock can deliver returns even in a high fuel price, bumpy recovery 
environment," he said. Shares in the group rose 2c to E3.67.

Despite being sued by French authorities over alleged tax and social insurance infringements, Ryaanir is greatly 
expanding its Marseille service this Summer, adding 11 new routes.
The expansion will see up to two aircraft temporarily overnight at the airport for just over a four month period (14th 
April until 4th Sept) offering 24 routes and delivering 500,000 passengers at Marseille's MP2 terminal.
The 11 summer destinations are Agadir, Brest, Eindhoven, Fez, Gothenburg, Lille, Marrakesh, Nador, Nantes, 
Palermo and Tangier. These are in addition to the 13 existing routes which include Stansted and Edinburgh in the 
UK.
Ryanair closed its Marseille base in January following unjustified legal proceedings which sought to force Ryanair's 
Irish crew to pay tax and social insurance in France, despite European Regulations which allow Ryanair's crews to 
pay taxes and social insurance in Ireland where they were employed, worked and paid. Ryanair continues to 
operate 13 routes to Marseille from other Ryanair bases and has taken a case in the European Courts against the 
French decree. "This summer operation will involve the temporary overnighting of up to two Irish registered aircraft, 
with Irish crews, on Irish contracts, paying their tax and social insurance in Ireland for a four month period. Ryanair 
remains committed to Marseille Airport and we look forward to continuing to work with Marseille Airport and the 
Chamber of Commerce to deliver new routes and new visitors to MP2 from mid-April to early September 2011," 
said CEO, Michael O'Leary.

Just how Irish is Ryanair, an airline headquartered in Dublin and run by one of Ireland's most prominent 
businessmen? Not very, according to the man himself. Chief executive Michael O'Leary used a third-quarter 
earnings announcement to lay into analysts and media that he deemed to have overweighted the importance of 
Ireland to the growth prospects of Europe's biggest airline.
The first sizeable route operated by Ryanair was Dublin to Luton in 1986. But since then the unstoppable expansion 
of the ultimate low-cost carrier has tilted it away from its homeland. Only 10 per cent of its total of 72.7m 
passengers last year were Irish.
Ireland has become the temporary focus of Mr O'Leary's permanent state of irritation because the country's 
economic woes have depressed consumption and the expectations of investors. But it is difficult for the company to 
appear less Irish, short of changing its name to Flyin' Air and its boss's moniker to Michael O. Lowry. Multinational 
businesses remain lumbered with their birthplace identities long after the bulk of their revenues come from 
overseas. BP was thus anachronistically referred to as "British Petroleum" in the US during last year's Macondo oil 
spill furore. UK-based banks such as HSBC must meanwhile cope with UK media assumptions that worldwide 
profits numbered in billions betoken exploitation of modest UK retail customer bases.
However, scrutiny of Ryanair's non-Irish passenger numbers adds little to the confidence already inspired by the 
strength of the airline's no-frills business model. The UK, whose output nosedived last quarter, supplied 30 per cent 
of Ryanair's customers in 2010. Worse, 40 per cent were Spanish or Italian. Germany, the European Union's 
strongest large economy, generated just 12 per cent of business.
Mr O'Leary was on firmer ground in railing against EU regulations that force airlines to meet the cost of 
accommodating and feeding passengers delayed by snowbound runways and striking air traffic controllers. 
Transferring the financial penalties of air transport disruption to infrastructure operators - generally national 
governments and airport companies - would create an incentive for better performance.
Low-cost air travel à la Ryanair is just about bearable, providing you do not have to wait three days for that 
questionable privilege.

Snow, fuel prices and strikes blamed
Chief points to the benefit of new routes
Body
Ryanair has blamed higher fuel costs, industrial action by air traffic controllers and snow-related airport closures for 
the budget carrier's third-quarter loss of more than EUR10m ($13.6m).
The loss comes in spite of passenger numbers at the Irish airline increasing by 1m to 17m in the period, and 
turnover rising by 22 per cent to EUR746m.
The average fare price rose 15 per cent to EUR34, and ancillary revenues - which include baggage fees, travel 
insurance, onboard snacks and other non-ticket items - increased by 12.6 per cent to EUR9.80 per passenger.
Although the EUR10.3m third-quarter loss narrowed slightly from EUR10.9m in the same period in 2009, Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the results were "disappointing". "Earnings were hit by a series of air traffic 
controller strikes/walkouts, compounded by a spate of bad weather airport closures in December," he said in a 
statement on Monday.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline by market capitalisation said that it had cancelled more than 3,000 flights in the 
third quarter to the end of December, compared with about 1,400 during the 2009-10 financial year. Snow forced 
flight cancellations to many European cities in December and runways were closed at airports including Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Edinburgh.
Ryanair also said that the rising price of crude had boosted its fuel costs, with the airline noting "a 37 per cent 
increase in our fuel bill", although Mr O'Leary said the group was 90 per cent hedged for its fourth quarter at $750 a 
tonne.
Ryanair results disappoint O'Leary
"Our outlook for the fourth quarter and the remainder of the financial year 2011 remains largely unchanged," said 
Mr O'Leary. "We expect traffic and average fares to continue to benefit from a better mix of new routes and bases, 
and competitor fuel surcharges. Accordingly, we are now confident that our fourth-quarter and full-year results will 
be towards the upper end of our previously guided range of a net profit after tax of between EUR380m to 
EUR400m."
Last year the Dublin-based group increased its full-year earnings estimates after posting a healthy profit for the six 
months to the end of September.
Mr O'Leary also attempted to distance the carrier from Ireland 's financial difficulties, and asserted that "the 
widespread negative commentary on the Irish economy has been allowed to cloud some analysis of Ryanair's 
future growth and profitability". "Ireland has fallen from over 20 per cent of Ryanair's originating traffic to less than 
10 per cent in the current year. Ryanair has little exposure to the Irish economy," he said.
Analysts at Panmure Gordon held their "buy" recommendation on Ryanair stock, but added a note of caution. "Next 
year will provide some challenges as economic conditions remain uncertain. Fuel prices will be higher, but this is an 
industry-wide issue and we expect this to result in higher yields," they said.

Ryanair and EasyJet might seem much of a muchness to Europe's travellers, but to investors they are a class 
apart. Shares in Ryanair, which is the more profitable and reliable, usually trade at a deserved premium to those of 
its smaller rival.
During the past six months, that premium has narrowed on signs that EasyJet is pulling itself together at last. 
Carolyn McCall and Chris Kennedy, the new chief executive and finance director, promised to fix embarrassing 
operational mishaps, such as cabin crew finding themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. They brokered a 
truce with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet's founder and largest shareholder, who has been agitating for less 
growth and more profit. The pair also came up with a reasonable strategy: buy fewer planes, attract more business 
travellers and lift pre-tax profit per seat from £3.36 last year to £5.
Ryanair also plans to slow down and increase fares after several years of breakneck growth. It is still better at the 
execution, though. In January, EasyJet reported stagnant revenue per passenger in the latest quarter, sounded the 
alarm on oil prices and said its loss in the six months to March would be double that of a year ago. Ryanair, 
meanwhile, reported a 13 per cent rise in revenue per passenger, revealed prudent oil hedges and reaffirmed its 
full-year profit guidance. Ms McCall and Mr Kennedy have not worked at an airline before and could use some 
decent macroeconomic (and meteorological) conditions while they settle in. Instead they face oil prices touching 
$100 a barrel - particularly painful for low-cost airlines. The gap between EasyJet's valuation (about 8 times next 
year's expected earnings) and Ryanair's (about 11 times) should widen again. In difficult times, investors can 
expect to pay extra for an experienced pair of hands.

Snow, fuel costs and strikes blamed
Airline upbeat over full-year outcome
Body
Ryanair blamed higher fuel costs, industrial action by air traffic controllers and snow-related airport closures for its 
third-quarter loss of more than EUR10m (£8.5m).
The loss came in spite of a 1m increase in passenger numbers to 17m in the period and a 22 per cent rise in 
turnover to EUR746m.
The average fare rose 15 per cent to EUR34 and ancillary revenues - which include baggage fees, travel insurance 
and onboard snacks - increased 12.6 per cent to EUR9.80 a passenger.
Although the EUR10.3m third-quarter loss was slightly narrower than the EUR10.9m reported in the same period in 
2009, Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the results were "disappointing".
"Earnings were hit by a series of air traffic controller strikes/walkouts, compounded by a spate of bad weather 
airport closures in December," he said on Monday.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline by market capitalisation said it had cancelled more than 3,000 flights in the three 
months to the end of December, compared with about 1,400 during the 2009-10 financial year.
Ryanair said the rising price of crude oil had increased its fuel costs by 37 per cent, but Mr O'Leary said the group 
was 90 per cent hedged for its fourth-quarter at $750 a tonne.
"Our outlook for the fourth quarter and the remainder of the financial year 2011 remains largely unchanged," said 
Mr O'Leary.

Body
RYANAIR blamed its (EURO)10m (£8.5m) quarterly loss yesterday on strikes, fuel costs and disruption caused by 
the weather yesterday, and pledged to take its fight against flight compensation rules to the European courts.
The budget airline said it still expects to make a net profit for the year to March towards the top of its (EURO)380m 
(£325m) to (EURO)400m target.
Ryanair said it grew total revenue by 22 per cent to (EURO)746m during the quarter benefiting from a six per cent 
increase in passenger numbers to 17m and a 13 per cent rise in revenue per passenger.
The company said it had been on track to break even during the quarter before the snow knocked out many 
services for close to a week.
Ryanair did not reveal how much damage the snow has done to its bottom line, but said it will contest European 
rules on compensation in the courts.
The Irish carrier has previously called the rules requiring airlines to provide food and accommodation for 
passengers waiting for delayed flights as "absurd and discriminatory".
The firm's fuel bill soared 37 per cent to (EURO)283.7m as the price of oil continued to climb, though it has 
insulated itself against further rises by hedging 90 per cent of its fuel needs for 2011 at $750 per tonne.
"Ourselves and easyJet are the only two carriers of any size and shape growing this year and next year. The flag 
carriers have stopped growing and are continuing to retreat," said finance director Howard Millar.
RYANAIR VS COMPENSATION LAW Q.
Ryanair posts quarterly loss due to snow; TRANSPORT
WHAT RULES ARE RYANAIR CHALLENGING? A.
Passengers flying within or into the European Economic Area can claim compensation if their flights are cancelled, 
and are also entitled to meals, two telephone calls and accommodation while awaiting a later flight. The rights also 
apply if a long-haul flight is delayed by more than four hours, or less for shorter journeys, under the EU regulation 
261/2004.
Q.
WHY DOES RYANAIR OBJECT TO THESE RULES? A.
The regulation places the cost or caring for stranded passengers with the airline, which Ryanair argues is unfair 
since the airport has more control over whether flights are delayed or cancelled.
Q.
CAN RYANAIR SUCCEED IN CHALLENGING THIS LAW? A.
EU-261 has been in force for seven years without any successful legal challenges, so it's unlikely that Ryanair can 
persuade the EU to rip up the entire rulebook. In 2005, the European Court of Justice threw out a case brought by a 
group of low cost airlines including Ryanair that claimed the rules discriminated against budget carriers.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RYANAIR'S RESULTS? By Marion Dakers DAVID BUIK | BGC CAPITAL I thought the 
results were good.
"Ryanair is excellent at cutting costs when sales are lower, and the fact that the firm has hedged its fuel costs for 
the next year is pretty smart. The company does what it does very well, and under the circumstances of the snow 
and other disruption the balance sheet looks fairly strong.
GERT ZONNEVELD | PANMURE GORDON "GREG SMITH | FAT PROPHETS " While some of the figures are 
disappointing, the fact that the overall transaction rates have gone up is an advantage for Ryanair. The firm's policy 
of ancilliary charges might not be popular with everyone, but it's a way of pushing up its profit per seat. It has also 
hedged nearly all of its fuel costs next year, avoiding what could have been a huge problem.
"Solid third-quarter numbers. Next year will provide some challenges as economic conditions remain uncertain.
"Over the medium term, the capacity growth deceleration [and eventual standstill] should translate into attractive 
and sustainable profit growth. Cash generation should be strong, possibly around (EURO)1bn [£854m) per annum 
once aircraft deliveries come to an end, making further returns of capital likely in the coming years.

Body
Budget airline Ryanair announced an unexpected third-quarter net loss of (EURO)10.3 million ($14 million) Monday 
and blamed snow-covered runways and air-traffic controller strikes for lost business.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline suffered more than 3,000 flight cancelations during the 
October-December quarter, more than double the number experienced in all of 2009. He called the third-quarter 
losses "disappointing, as we were on track to break even."
However, O'Leary said Ryanair's outlook would remain stable for a full-year profit in a range of (EURO)380 million 
to (EURO)400 million ($517 million to $545 million). He noted that the airline has already hedged most of its fuel 
supply and U.S. dollar needs at advantageous rates through 2012.
Ryanair shares rose 1.7 percent to (EURO)3.68 in midmorning trade on the Irish Stock Exchange. Analysts said 
Ryanair continued to be the European airline most likely to keep growing regardless of wider economic trends.
Investec Asset Management in London said Monday's figures offer "confidence that despite the dire consumer 
backdrop, low-cost carriers can continue to grow, driven by share shift as passengers trade down to low fares."
Ryanair offered no details on its lost business from flight cancelations attributed to strikes and December's snow 
chaos across Europe. Chief financial officer Howard Millar said only "a small percentage" was caused by air traffic 
controllers' unofficial strikes in several European countries.
Revenues grew 22 percent to (EURO)746.3 million ($1.02 billion), partly because average ticket prices rose 15 
percent. Passenger numbers rose 6 percent to 17 million.
Millar said the average one-way fare excluding Ryanair's panoply of added charges was (EURO)34 ($46). He said 
fares were rising chiefly because Ryanair is increasing longer routes to Eastern Europe, the Meditteranean and the 
Canary Islands that incur higher fuel costs.
Ryanair also recorded a (EURO)10.9 million loss in the third quarter of 2009. Typically the airline makes all or most 
of its profits during the heavier-traffic tourist periods in spring and summer.
Ryanair cites snow chaos for quarterly loss
O'Leary denounced European laws that leave airlines, rather than the airports, financially responsible for paying the 
bills of stranded passengers when runways are closed by bad weather or strikes.
"It is inequitable that airports enjoy a boost to their restaurant and retail revenues from stranded passengers when 
their runways close, yet the airlines are obliged to pay for meals, drinks and hotels, when these cancellations are 
outside of our control," O'Leary said.
Ryanair said its work force in the quarter grew 14 percent to 8,121, while its fuel costs rose 37 percent versus 2009 
to (EURO)283.7 million ($386.4 million) because of higher oil prices and longer average routes.

Europe's biggest low-cost airline Ryanair has re-affirmed its full-year profit target after rising passenger numbers 
and average fares helped offset disruption from strike action and bad weather.
The airline said this morning that it is on track to make a full-year net profit towards the upper end of its 380 - 400m 
euro target range.
Ryanair said it made a net loss of 10m euros in its third quarter to the end of December compared with an 11m euro 
loss a year earlier and a forecast for a net loss of 13.4m euros by in-house broker Davy.
"This small Q3 loss is disappointing, as we were on track to break even, but earnings were hit by a series of ATC 
strikes/walkouts, compounded by a spate of bad weather airport closures in December," said chief executive 
Michael O'Leary. Ryanair cancelled over 3,000 flights in the third quarter compared with over 1,400 cancellations in 
the previous year. However, O'Leary said he expected passenger numbers and average fares to continue to benefit 
in the fourth quarter from a better mix of new routes. The airline has offset weakness in the Irish and British 
economies by growing in lower cost markets such as Spain and Italy. Airlines typically lose money in the third 
quarter, which is the quietest period of the year for the industry. Ryanair said its total revenue grew by 22pc to 
746m euros during the quarter, benefiting from a 6pc increase in passenger numbers to 17m and a 15 pc rise in 
average fares.

The ISEQ slipped in to negative territory this morning in line with markets around Europe as on fears that the 
political upheaval in Egypt could spread across the region.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 6.94 points to 2,883.73.
The popular uprising that has spread from Tunisia to Egypt sent the VDAX-NEW volatility index, Europe's main 
barometer of investor anxiety, to a three-week peak. The higher the index, which is based on sell and buy options 
on Frankfurt's top-30 stocks, the lower the desire to take risk. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares 
was down 0.4 percent at 1,138.88 points after touching 1,131.56, the lowest since Jan. 10. Some analysts said that 
despite Monday's weakness in equity prices, the bias was still on the upside.
"People will continue to watch what's happening in Egypt, but I think the market takes this as an excuse after a long 
rally to do some profit taking," said Klaus Wiener, chief economist at Generali Investments. Shares in Ryanair rose 
5c to E3.67 after it said it sees its full-year profit at the upper end of expectations as rising passenger numbers and 
average fares help offset disruption from strikes and bad weather. The Irish airline said it was on track to make net 
profit in the year to March towards the top of a 380 million euro (dollar 517 million) to 400 million euro target range. 
Ryanair, which operates more than 1,500 flights a day, said it made a net loss of 10 million euros in the third quarter 
to the end of December. This compared with an 11 million euro loss a year earlier and a forecast for a net loss of 
13.4 million euros by in-house broker Davy. "This small Q3 loss is disappointing, as we were on track to break 
even, but earnings were hit by a series of air traffic controllers (ATC) strikes compounded by a spate of bad weather 
airport closures in December," said CEO Michael O'Leary. Shares in Aer Lingus, still being hit by its dispute with 
cabin staff, fell 2c to E1.04. Food firm, Origin Enterprises, today said it has completed a deal to establish an all-

The ISEQ slipped steeply in to negative territory today in line with markets around Europe on fears that the political 
upheaval in Egypt could spread across the region.
The index fell 37.86 points to 2,852.81.
The popular uprising that has spread from Tunisia to Egypt sent the VDAX-NEW volatility index, Europe's main 
barometer of investor anxiety, to a three-week peak. The higher the index, which is based on sell and buy options 
on Frankfurt's top-30 stocks, the lower the desire to take risk. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares 
was down 0.4 percent at 1,138.88 points after touching 1,131.56, the lowest since Jan. 10. Some analysts said that 
despite Monday's weakness in equity prices, the bias was still on the upside.
"People will continue to watch what's happening in Egypt, but I think the market takes this as an excuse after a long 
rally to do some profit taking," said Klaus Wiener, chief economist at Generali Investments. Shares in Ryanair rose 
3c to E3.65 after it said it sees its full-year profit at the upper end of expectations as rising passenger numbers and 
average fares help offset disruption from strikes and bad weather. The Irish airline said it was on track to make net 
profit in the year to March towards the top of a E380 million to E400 million target range. Ryanair, which operates 
more than 1,500 flights a day, said it made a net loss of E10 million in the third quarter to the end of December. 
This compared with an E11 million loss a year earlier and a forecast for a net loss of E13.4 million by in-house 
broker Davy. "This small Q3 loss is disappointing, as we were on track to break even, but earnings were hit by a 
series of air traffic controllers (ATC) strikes compounded by a spate of bad weather airport closures in December," 
said CEO Michael O'Leary. Shares in Aer Lingus, still being hit by its dispute with cabin staff, fell 2c to E1.03. Food 
firm, Origin Enterprises, today said it has completed a deal to establish an all-Ireland grain and feed handling, 
logistics and trading business through a merger with its R and H Hall business in the South and the business of 
Origin and Barnett in the Six Counties. Origin's shares were flat at E3.60 while its owners, Aryzta, saw its stocks

plunge 41c to E31.75. Smurfit Kappa's European solid board business announced a E60 a tonne increase from 
March 1st for solid board grades on the back of rising raw material costs. The business will also raised prices for 
solid board packaging. Last year Smurfit Kappa produced just below 600k tonnes of solid board. Shares in Smurfit 
Kappa fell 5c to E8.79. MBL Group, a UK distributor of home entertainment products and peer of DCC Sercom 
(about 20pc of DCC Group profit), has announced that its profits for the year end to March 11, will be "substantially 
behind management's revised expectations". Having pulled back guidance at the beginning of December, the 
Group experienced continued margin and volume pressure resulting in the profit warning. Shares in DCC dropped 
by 23c to E21.80.

Talks are to resume today at the Labour Relations Commission in an effort to end the cabin crew dispute at Aer 
Lingus.
The talks broke up on Friday without agreement, but are to resume after weekend contacts by the LRC's Kevin 
Foley with the airline and the cabin crew union IMPACT.
The dispute is now in its third week and the carrier has warned intending passengers that there is a risk of flights 
being disrupted again today.
Aer Lingus said yesterday that bookings had started to suffer as result of the dispute over working hours that has 
cancelled flights and forced 215 people off the payroll. "Definitely yes," Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington told 
RTE, when asked whether bookings were down as a result of the dispute. "It has had a negative impact on 
bookings ... People hate uncertainty. Last year we had the ash, then the snow in the winter and now this." 
Barrington said it was impossible to know the precise financial cost of the dispute because the airline did not know 
when it would come to an end. Aer Lingus has leased aircraft and crew from other airlines, including domestic rival 
Ryanair, to continue its operations during the strike. However, around 10 percent of its flights are being cancelled. 
Barrington, who is also the chief executive of aircraft leasing company Babcock and Brown Air, said the estimate by 
the IMPACT trade union that the dispute was costing Aer Lingus 400,000 euros a day was "significantly over-
inflated". Separately, Aer Lingus has said all its flights to continental Europe from Dublin will operate from the new 
T2 terminal at Dublin airport from today.

Ryanair reports Q3 loss thanks to strikes and snow, optimistic for FY
Ryanair reports Q3 loss thanks to strikes and snow, optimistic for FY

   Jan. 31, 2011 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
Budget airline Ryanair reported a fall in its losses in the third quarter ended 31 December 2010, and added that it 
expected full year results to be towards the upper end of expectations.
During the period passenger numbers rose six per cent from the previous year to 17 million, while revenue 
increased 22 per cent to 746 million euros.
Adjusted post-tax losses were 10.3 million euros, down from a loss of 10.9 million euros in the same period the 
previous year.
Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, said, "This small Q3 loss of ??10m is disappointing, as we were on track to break 
even, but earnings were hit by a series of ATC strikes/walkouts in Q3, compounded by a spate of bad weather 
airport closures in December.  The scale of these disruptions is evident by the fact that we cancelled over 3,000 
flights in Q3, compared to over 1,400 cancellations during the previous fiscal year.
"We are surprised that the widespread negative commentary on the Irish economy has been allowed to cloud some 
analysis of Ryanair's future growth and profitability.  Some commentators misunderstand that over recent years, 
due to high airport costs at Shannon and Dublin, as well as rapid capacity growth in lower cost markets like Spain 
and Italy, Ireland has fallen from over 20% of Ryanair's originating traffic to less than 10% in the current year.  
 Ryanair has little exposure to the Irish economy
"Our outlook for Q4 and the remainder of FY11 remains largely unchanged.  Easter does not fall in the current Q4, 
which makes the comparatives challenging.  We expect traffic and average fares to continue to benefit from a better 
mix of new routes and bases, and competitor fuel surcharges (which in many cases exceed Ryanair's lowest fares).  
We expect our unit cost performance in Q4 to be marginally better thanks to the launch of new routes in Feb and 
March which will reduce the number of grounded aircraft by comparison with Q3.  Accordingly, we are now 
Ryanair reports Q3 loss thanks to strikes and snow, optimistic for FY
confident that our Q4 and full year results will be towards the upper end of our previously guided range of a Net 
Profit after tax of between ??380m to ??400m after tax."

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported a wider pre-tax loss for the third quarter on 
higher operating expenses, despite growth in traffic and average fares. Meanwhile, net loss for the quarter 
narrowed from the previous year.
For the third quarter, the company's loss before tax widened to 12.7 million euros from 12.5 million in the previous 
year.
Loss attributable to equity holders, on IFRS basis, narrowed to 10.3 million euros or 0.69 cents per share from 10.9 
million euros or 0.74 cents per share in the prior year.
Michael O'Leary, CEO of the company said, "This small Q.3 loss of 10 million euros is disappointing, as we were on 
track to break even, but earnings were hit by a series of ATC strikes/walkouts in Q.3, compounded by a spate of 
bad weather airport closures in December."
Due to disruptions during the period, Ryanair canceled over 3,000 flights, compared to over 1,400 cancellations 
during the prior-year period.
Total operating revenues grew 22 percent to 746.3 million euros from 611.9 million euros in the same quarter last 
year, helped by a 6 percent increase in passenger traffic and a 15 percent rise in average fares. Ancillary revenues 
grew by 20 percent.
Total revenue per passenger increased by 15 percent due to a combination of a 15 increase in average fares and 
13 percent rise in ancillary revenues per passenger.
The company said unit costs were up 15 percent due to a 14 percent increase in flight hours. Fuel costs during the 
period increased 37 percent from last year. Excluding fuel, unit costs increased 8 percent.
Total operating expenses increased to 746.6 million euros from 610.5 million euros a year ago.
Moving ahead, the company said its outlook for fourth quarter and the remainder of FY11 remains largely 
unchanged.
The company also said it expects full-year results to be towards the upper end of its previously guided range of a 
net profit after tax of between 380 million euros to 400 million euros.
Ryanair Q3 Pre-tax Loss Widens - Update
RYAAY closed Friday's regular trading at $30.25 on the Nasdaq.
RYA.L is currently trading at 3.67 pence, up 0.04 pence or 1.35 percent on a volume of 2.55 million shares.

Budget airline Ryanair has announced an unexpected third-quarter net loss of (EURO)10.3 million ($14 million) and 
blamed snow-covered runways and air-traffic controller strikes for lost business.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said Monday that the airline suffered more than 3,000 flight cancelations 
during the October-December quarter, more than double the number experienced in all of 2009.
However, O'Leary says Ryanair's outlook remains stable for a full-year profit falling in a range of (EURO)380 million 
to (EURO)400 million ($517 million to $545 million).
O'Leary called the third-quarter losses "disappointing, as we were on track to break even."
Revenues grew 22 percent to (EURO)746 million ($1.02 billion), partly because average ticket prices rose 15 
percent.

  Rupert Murdoch has much on his plate as he approaches News Corp 's second-quarter earnings announcement, 
writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson .
Investigations into phone hacking allegations at his News of the World UK tabloid have spilt over into a political 
debate about his proposed bid for full control of British Sky Broadcasting.
Investors may not get much of an update on the largest deal in the company's history, which is critical to how it 
spends its cash pile. Instead, they hope for news about MySpace, the lossmaking social networking site for which 
News Corp is looking for buyers; the improving economics of its cable television networks; and the imminent launch 
of The Daily, a "newspaper" for tablets such as Apple's iPad.
The film division will struggle to compete with last year's blockbuster success from Avatar, but analysts note the 
wider group has given guidance for low double-digit growth for the full year.

  Deutsche Bank 's full-year results mark the halfway stage of its plan, outlined in 2009, to increase pre-tax profits 
by almost 100 per cent over two years to EUR10bn, writes James Wilson .
Most analysts are not convinced about the bank's chances. Deutsche concluded a number of deals last year to 
bolster its non-investment banking earnings - buying Deutsche Postbank, Sal Oppenheim and some of the former 
ABN Amro's Dutch business - but remains heavily reliant on revenues from trading. Some rivals' results in this area 
have been disappointing, however, especially in the fixed-income business that is the heart of Deutsche's 
operations.
Higher capital requirements are also likely to cut future returns, and investors will probably want more information 
about the outlook for Postbank.
  CME Group , the world's biggest futures exchange group, will not be short of conversation topics when the 
company reports fourth-quarter earnings, writes Hal Weitzman.
Trading volumes rose 19 per cent last year from 2009 to an average of 12.2m contracts a day - a welcome reversal 
of the previous year's trend, when volumes fell by a fifth.
Corporate diary
The company is also developing, having received approval from the UK Financial Services Authority, its clearing 
house for European over-the-counter derivatives in London. It launched clearing for interest rate swaps in the US in 
October.
But investors remain uncertain, given the political fog shrouding the industry as the final shape of US financial 
regulatory reform slowly emerges.
Lack of clarity has meant that the much-touted shift of OTC trading to the listed market has yet to happen in a 
substantial way.
  Sony is expected to report lower profits for the quarter to December, reflecting falling sales at its Sony Ericsson 
mobile phone venture, weaker demand for video game consoles and slowing growth in flat-screen televisions, 
writes Jonathan Soble  .
The Japanese group last week unveiled a successor to its PlayStation Portable hand-held game player, which 
along with Nintendo's forthcoming 3DS portable could revive flagging consumer demand for specialised gaming 
platforms.
Their popularity has been eroded by smartphones and tablets with enhanced gaming capabilities. This led to 
industry-wide console sales falling 13 per cent in the US last year. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect Sony's 
net profits to have slipped 15 per cent in the October-December period compared with a year earlier, to Y66bn.

  LVMH , the luxury goods group headed by Bernard Arnault, is expected to report strong full-year results after a 
recovery last year for the industry, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu  .
Sales, powered by the Louis Vuitton brand, are expected to reach EUR20.2bn, an increase of 18 per cent on last 
year's turnover, with net profit of between EUR2.5bn and EUR3bn.
The final profit number will depend on the accounting method used by LVMH for its surprise 20 per cent stake in 
Hermès, the silk scarves and bags company, disclosed in October. The Hermès stake has raised many questions, 
not least what Mr Arnault plans to do with it now that the descendants of the founding family, which control Hermès, 
have made clear they do not want to work with him.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported third-quarter loss attributable to equity holders, on 
IFRS basis, of 10.3 million euros or 0.69 cents per share, narrower than 10.9 million euros or 0.74 cents per share 
last year.
Pre-tax loss widened to 12.7 million euros from 12.5 million in the prior-year quarter.
Total operating revenues grew to 746.3 million euros from 611.9 million euros in the same quarter last year.
Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said,

by a series of ATC strikes/walkouts in Q.3, compounded by a spate of bad weather airport closures in December."
Moving ahead, the company said its outlook for fourth quarter and the remainder of FY11 remains largely 
unchanged. The company is now confident that that its full year results will be towards the upper end of its 
previously guided range of a Net Profit after tax of between 380 million euros to 400 million euros after tax.

Ryanair customers can save up to  10 per person per round trip and make a contribution to Barnardos by buying 
the charity's new prepaid chip-and-pin MasterCard.
The Barnardos Rubycard costs  12.95 in any of the six Barnardos shops or online.
For each card bought in a Barnardos shop, Rubycard will donate  1.50 to the children's charity.
A percentage of transaction fees will also be donated to the charity at no cost to the cardholder. The card can be 
used to book flights online with Ryanair without paying a credit card fee.
The card was launched by John Lowe, founder of financial advisory firm The Money Doctor. ''Unlike having a credit 
card, the Barnardos Rubycard helps the user to avoid overspending, as they can only spend the money loaded onto 
their card," Lowe said.
Cardholders can choose from two tariff options. The first, a pay-as-you-go option, has no monthly fee, but charges 
transaction fees. Purchases are charged at 2.95 per cent, subject to a cap of  2. ATM withdrawals are charged at  2 
in Ireland and  3.50 abroad.
The second option charges a flat  6 per month fee.
There are no further transaction fees for purchases, but withdrawal charges still apply.
Web banking hikes mortgage workload
Online banking can increase the workload when applying for a mortgage, according to personal finance website, 
Moneycoach.ie.
Almost all mortgage lenders require at least three months' original bank statements as part of the mortgage 
application process.
Loose Change
This means an official printed statement on bank stationery, as opposed to an electronic statement.
Frank Conway, director of Moneycoach.ie, said electronic Bank statements, printed from home computers, had little 
hard evidence of originality, and banks generally required other evidence by the applicant to verify authenticity.
''It's a real headache for some people, especially those who bought into the whole idea of electronic banking," said 
Conway.
Fuel prices are affecting motorists
Almost half of all motorists are planning to reduce the distance they drive this year because of rising fuel prices, 
according to a survey by the AA.
More than four in five motorists also said they intended to shop around when buying fuel. Only 3 per cent of 
respondents said they did not look at prices when buying fuel.
According to the AA figures, a typical driver doing 12,000 miles per year and getting an average of 30 miles to the 
gallon will use 150 litres of fuel per month.
This translated to a monthly fuel cost of  220.
''People are absolutely livid," said Conor Faughnan, director of policy with the AA.
''It is completely maddening because we know that a large chunk of this price increase is down to extra Irish taxes, 
with nearly 19 cent per litre added in excise duty and carbon tax since 2008."
According to the AA, using a car's air-conditioning system could add up to 10 per cent to your fuel bill.
Three in five drivers said that they tried to avoid or minimise use of the air conditioning while driving, because they 
were conscious of fuel consumption.
Consumers' airline strike worry
Half of all consumers are concerned that airline strikes will affect their travel plans this year. A survey by online 
insurer Multitrip.
com found that 26 per cent of consumers were also worried about how they would be affected if an airline went into 
liquidation or there was a strike.
''With many airlines facing into another year of possible disruption, it is important that customers are aware of what 
they are covered for in the event of strike action," said Ciaran Mulligan, joint managing director ofMultitrip.com.
He said Multitrip's policies provided cover for strikes and travel disruption.
The policies also protect travellers against financial failure or insolvency of airlines and other suppliers up to  2,000 
per person.
ECB banknote requirements introduced
New European Central Bank requirements for banknotes have come into effect in Ireland.
The rules apply to professional cash handlers, banks, building societies, credit unions and post offices. Retailers 
who fill in-store ATMs, cash intransit companies and bureaux de change also have to meet the requirements.
All banknotes intended for circulation have to be checked for authenticity and meet specified fitness standards.
The rules aim to ensure that banknotes are of a consistent quality and standard, so it will be easier to spot 
counterfeit notes.
Loose Change
Avantis launches new service
Avantis Health has launched a new service which effectively allows Irish consumers to 'self-insure' to cover their 
medical costs. ''Self-funded health care is an international norm," said Orla Fahy, director of Avantis Health. ''With 
the cost of health insurance policies rising to unsustainable highs, this is an important alternative for Irish 
consumers and businesses."
Under the terms of the new service, consumers save for their healthcare requirements using health savings 
accounts in mainstream banks.
Additional products, such as a critical illness policy or hospital cash policies, can be added to manage the financial 
risk of serious illness. If a customer requires medical treatment, Avantis will source and pay for required treatments 
on behalf of the patient, obtaining discounts for bulk-buying.
First-time buyer survey
An average working couple who are first-time buyers pay 12.6 per cent of their joint disposable income to fund their 
mortgage, according to the latest affordability index from building society EBS and consultancy firm DKM.
According to the index, housing is more affordable today than at any time in the past 25 years.
At the height of the housing boom, in December 2006, monthly mortgage repayments for the average first-time 
buyer couple were  1,323, or 26.4 per cent of their net income.
This has more than halved, with average monthly repayments now standing at  639.

Aer Lingus is to meet today with the IMPACT trade union to discuss its dispute with cabin crew.
The dispute over working hours has led to cancelled flights and forced 215 people off the payroll.
The carrier says it has accepted an invitation from the employer group IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade 
Unions to meet with the national secretary of IMPACT, which represents the cabine crew.
The airline has sought to operate its schedule going by leasing aircraft and crew from other airlines, including rival 
Ryanair. Despite this, it has had to cancel about 10 pc of flights since the dispute started last week. The company 
has said the financial cost of the strike was not material but warned that if it continued it could hit the group's 
financial performance if bookings started to suffer. IMPACT has said the dispute is costing Aer Lingus 400,000 
euros a day. Aer Lingus has raised the number of annual flight hours to 850 from 830 as part of cost-cutting 
measures to return it to profitability. Talks on the new rosters started in autumn and were introduced last week. 
Shares in Aer Lingus finished up 3pc at 106 last night.

EU blocks Olympic, Aegean airlines merger

The European Union's top competition regulator on Wednesday blocked the merger between Greek airlines 
Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines SA, saying a combined carrier could monopolize Greek air travel.
The merger "would have led to higher fares for four out of six million Greek and European consumers traveling on 
routes to and from Athens each year," the European Commission said.
Together, the two carriers control more than 90 percent of the Greek air transport market, making it impossible for a 
new airline to enter and keep a check on prices and the quality of services through competition, the Commission 
said.
It is the first time the Commission has blocked a deal since it squashed Ryanair Holdings PLC's attempt to take 
over Aer Lingus Group PLC in 2007.
Aegean and Olympic offered to give up takeoff and landing slots at Greek airports, but the Commission said airports 
in the country did not suffer from congestion like travel hubs elsewhere.
"My services and myself did our best to find a solution, but unfortunately the remedies offered by the companies 
would not have adequately protected the interests of the four million consumers that use the routes," Competition 
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
To win EU approval the airlines could have offered to sell part of their fleet to a potential competitor or let another 
airline use one of their brand names, Almunia said.
A combination of the two airlines would have given them a near monopoly for the routes between Athens and 
Thessaloniki, Greece's second-biggest city, and between Athens and some of the country's most popular holiday 
destinations, such as Crete, Rhodes, Santorini, Mytilini, Chios, Kos and Samos, the Commission said.
When they announced the merger in February, Olympic and Aegean cited Greece's dire economic situation as one 
of the reasons for a combination. Greece received a (EURO)110 billion ($151 billion) international bailout in May.
EU blocks Olympic, Aegean airlines merger
On Wednesday, Andreas Vgenopoulos, the chairman of Marfin Investment Group, which owns Olympic, said the 
Commission's decision "will have negative consequences for consumers as well as our country's economy." He 
added the two airlines would review the ruling to decide whether they will challenge it in EU courts.
But Almunia argued that the economic crisis heightened the need for a "competitive and strong airline sector to 
boost its trade and tourism" in Greece. "We cannot afford that companies place the burden of the crisis on 
consumers, charging them higher prices and reducing choice," he said.
Theodore Vassilakis, Aegean's chairman said "an important opportunity for a consolidated representation in the 
European aviation market has been lost."
Over the past two decades, the European Commission has ruled on more than 4,500 mergers and takeovers and 
has so far blocked 21. "Our merger control policy does not change. Prohibition decisions will remain very rare," 
Almunia stressed.

   Jan. 26, 2011 (International Business Times News delivered by Newstex) --
The European Commission said it has blocked a proposed merger between Greeces two major airlines, Olympic Air 
and Aegean Airlines SA, because it would have created a "quasi-monopoly" and lead to "to higher fares for four of 
the six million Greek and European passengers flying to and from Athens each year".
Citing that Olympic and Aegean controlled more than 90 percent of the domestic Greek market, the Commission 
said its investigation showed œno realistic prospects that a new airline of a sufficient size would enter the routes 
and restrain the merged entity's pricing.
The merger between Aegean and Olympic, the Commission added, would have led to a œquasi-monopoly in 
Greece and thus to higher prices and lower quality of service for Greeks and tourists travelling between Athens and 
the islands," said Joaquin Almunia, the Commission's vice-president of competition policy.
The merger of the Greek air carriers was initially announced last February, when the countrys dire economic 
situation was cited as reason for a combination.
"An important opportunity for a consolidated representation in the European aviation market has been lost," said 
Theodore Vassilakis, chairman of Aegean Airlines. "We will adjust and continue. Our track record shows that we 
can succeed through challenging times."
Andreas Vgenopoulos, the chairman of Marfin Investment Group, which owns Olympic, said the Commission's 
decision "will have negative consequences for consumers as well as our country's economy."
The Commission had blocked a similar merger of Irish airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC (OOTC:RYAOF)  
(NASDAQ:RYAAY)  and Aer Lingus Group PLC (OOTC:AELGF)  back in 2007.

First antitrust block in almost four years
Go-ahead likely for Intel to buy McAfee
Body
European antitrust regulators are poised to block a proposed merger for the first time in almost four years.
The decision to give a red light to the planned tie-up between Olympic Airlines and fellow Greek carrier Aegean will 
be announced today by Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner.
Separately, Mr Almunia is expected to give a conditional go-ahead to another contentious takeover deal, the $7.7bn 
purchase of US security software company McAfee by Intel, after the world's biggest chipmaker offered 
concessions.
The Greek airline merger will be the first takeover to face outright opposition from EU competition officials since 
Ryanair was told that it could not acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus in mid-2007.
It has been rare for Brussels to block takeovers recently - although some transactions have been voluntarily 
withdrawn when faced by official scrutiny and many others have offered concessions in order to win approval.
Between 1994 and 2003, for example, the European Commission blocked 23 mergers out of the more than 2,000 
deals notified. But between 2004 and 2010 only two deals were barred.
The Greek airline decision will come seven months after Athens-listed Aegean notified the Commission of its plans 
to acquire local rival Olympic Airlines. Olympic was, for many years, Greece's state-owned carrier, but it was 
privatised and relaunched in 2009 after an earlier tussle with Brussels.
The merger deal was depicted in Athens as a response to the Greek financial crisis and the tough conditions in the 
airline sector. But Commission officials opened a probe into the proposed tie-up last July and said they were 
EU to veto Olympic tie-up with Aegean
worried that the combined entity would have "very high, if not monopolistic, market shares on all domestic routes 
and on a number of international routes where both parties operate". Efforts to resolve those worries through 
concessions by the carriers have not been successful.
By contrast, Intel - another company which has had past problems with competition officials in Brussels - is 
expected to have headed off a full probe into its proposed acquisition of McAfee by offering a set of remedies.
This transaction has already been cleared by US regulators. The concessions which the Commission will accept 
are thought to be designed to reduce Intel's ability to disadvantage security software from other companies from 
running on computers that use Intel chips.

Irish shares have followed international shares marginally higher in early trade this morning.
On what could be a momentous day for the country's political and economic life, the ISEQ index is up 12.31 points 
at 2,922.25.
The modest advance - following three previous rising sessions - appears to show that investors are taking a relaxed 
view of the latest twists in Ireland's budget row.
Eyes are nonetheless on a crucial vote on the Finance Bill at noon. A vote in favour of the Bill is likely to calm 
nerves further. However, a rejection would precipitate a general election and could unleash a new set of 
international jitters about Ireland's condition. Best performers this morning are Ryanair, up 5c to 361, and CRH,

The ISEQ made steady but modest gains this morning, managing to stay above the 2,900 level, but buying was 
held back by the shock news that the UK economy had fallen back in the last quarter.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 14.67 points to 2,908.04.
Britain is Ireland's largest single trading partner. Sterling and British shares fell following a shock contraction in UK 
economic growth in the last three months of 2010, while the euro retreated after hitting a two-month high against 
the dollar. The weak UK growth also fanned concerns over the global economic recovery, hurting oil prices, while 
scepticism over the cost of recapitalising Spanish banks weighed on euro zone peripheral government bonds and 
Spain's stocks. Britain's economy suffered a shock 0.5 percent contraction in the last quarter of 2010, with 
unusually poor winter weather accounting for only part of its first shrinkage in five quarters.
The ongoing eurozone debt crisis also had a dampening effect on stocks after the IMF called on the European 
Union to increase the size of its sovereign bail-out fund, and allow it greater flexibility in tackling the problems of the 
so-called euro zone peripheral states, including Ireland. AIB has made a profit of E1.4bn by buying back debt from 
its own subordinated bondholders. It has paid only 30pc of the nominal price of the bonds in the voluntary buyback. 
The gain will go some way towards funding the massive E6.1bn of capital that the bank needs to raise by the end of 
next month. Today marks the last day of trading for AIB on the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange. The bank 
will also delist from the New York and London Stock Exchanges. The now part-natio9nalised bank has been listed 
on the ISEQ since the middle of 1967. But from tomorrow its shares will be traded on the Enterprise Securities 
Market, which is best known for trading small mining and exploration firms. Shares in the bank fell 2c to E0.25. 
Bank of Ireland stocks were down 1c to E0.34 and Irish Life and Permanent dipped 1c to E0.85. Ryanair is due to 
report Q3 results on Monday January 31st. Ryanair is guiding yields of about 10pc and net profits of E380-400m for 
2011 (after making E451.9m in H1). Each 1pc improvement in yield adds around E27m, or 5pc, to earnings per 
ISEQ gains but held by UK growth fall ISEQ Up
share (EPS). "While sector length is adding to cost, it will help yields. However, the key driver is the mix of new 
bases (Barcelona, Canaries and Malta etc). The airline's key strength has been the ability to move assets from 
high-cost locations (e.g. Ireland, Germany) to lower-cost locations (e.g. Spain). Capacity growth in the Q3 quarter 
has been 6.7pc with 6.5pc traffic growth on loads broadly flat at 82pc. After originally assuming breakeven or better 
in Q3, we assume a net loss of E13.4m including additional E15m costs for snow disruption, EPS -0.9c)," said Davy 
analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair shares fell 1c to E3.60 while Aer Lingus, currently battling the unions in a 
rostering row with crew, saw its shares fall 2c to E1.03.

By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 14.67 points to 2,908.04.
Britain is Ireland's largest single trading partner. Sterling and British shares fell following a shock contraction in UK 
economic growth in the last three months of 2010, while the euro retreated after hitting a two-month high against 
the dollar. The weak UK growth also fanned concerns over the global economic recovery, hurting oil prices, while 
scepticism over the cost of recapitalising Spanish banks weighed on euro zone peripheral government bonds and 
Spain's stocks. Britain's economy suffered a shock 0.5 percent contraction in the last quarter of 2010, with 
unusually poor winter weather accounting for only part of its first shrinkage in five quarters.
The ongoing eurozone debt crisis also had a dampening effect on stocks after the IMF called on the European 
Union to increase the size of its sovereign bail-out fund, and allow it greater flexibility in tackling the problems of the 
so-called euro zone peripheral states, including Ireland. AIB has made a profit of E1.4bn by buying back debt from 
its own subordinated bondholders. It has paid only 30pc of the nominal price of the bonds in the voluntary buyback. 
The gain will go some way towards funding the massive E6.1bn of capital that the bank needs to raise by the end of 
next month. Today marks the last day of trading for AIB on the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange. The bank 
will also delist from the New York and London Stock Exchanges. The now part-natio9nalised bank has been listed 
on the ISEQ since the middle of 1967. But from tomorrow its shares will be traded on the Enterprise Securities 
Market, which is best known for trading small mining and exploration firms. Shares in the bank fell 2c to E0.25. 
Bank of Ireland stocks were down 1c to E0.34 and Irish Life and Permanent dipped 1c to E0.85. Ryanair is due to 
report Q3 results on Monday January 31st. Ryanair is guiding yields of about 10pc and net profits of E380-400m for 
2011 (after making E451.9m in H1). Each 1pc improvement in yield adds around E27m, or 5pc, to earnings per 
ISEQ gains but held by UK growth fall ISEQ Up
share (EPS). "While sector length is adding to cost, it will help yields. However, the key driver is the mix of new 
bases (Barcelona, Canaries and Malta etc). The airline's key strength has been the ability to move assets from 
high-cost locations (e.g. Ireland, Germany) to lower-cost locations (e.g. Spain). Capacity growth in the Q3 quarter 
has been 6.7pc with 6.5pc traffic growth on loads broadly flat at 82pc. After originally assuming breakeven or better 
in Q3, we assume a net loss of E13.4m including additional E15m costs for snow disruption, EPS -0.9c)," said Davy 
analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair shares fell 1c to E3.60 while Aer Lingus, currently battling the unions in a 
rostering row with crew, saw its shares fall 2c to E1.03.

More positive news on German growth could not lift German equities, which, weighed down by falling industrial 
groups, underperformed the European index.
Data released on Monday indicated that the eurozone service sector grew more than expected, with Germany 
showing stronger growth than countries on the periphery of the eurozone. There was positive data on German 
business sentiment on Friday.
The German Xetra Dax index rose just 0.1 per cent to 7,067.77, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 0.3 per 
cent to 1,151.18. The pan-European index had opened on a low note but received a boost from a solid New York 
opening.
Germany's industrial and manufacturing groups dragged on the Dax as data showed accelerating growth in 
services but slowing expansion in manufacturing. ThyssenKrupp , the steelmaker, fell 1.9 per cent to EUR29.39. 
German carmakers lost ground. Daimler fell 0.5 per cent to EUR54.52 and BMW  slipped 0.9 per cent to a two-
month low of EUR55.23.
Consumer groups elsewhere fell, with Philips Electronics the day's worst performer. The Dutch consumer 
electronics company, which had reported weak TV sales and lower-than- expected earnings, lost 5.5 per cent to 
EUR23.23.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 leisure goods sub-index fell 5.5 per cent to 2,322.14. Swiss watchmaker Swatch was one 
of the few groups in the index to jump significantly. It gained 3 per cent to SFr70.05. It hit a three-month low on 
Thursday.
The Irish market showed strong gains, in spite of its political crisis.

Its main index was up 1.7 per cent to 2,893.37. Ryanair rose 4.2 per cent to EUR3.61, and Elan,  the drugs group, 
rose 1.8 per cent to EUR4.81. Irish banks fell. Allied Irish Banks  lost 2.2 per cent to EUR0.26 and Bank of 
Ireland 1.7 per cent to EUR0.35.

Further positive news on German growth could not lift the country's equities, which, weighed down by falling 
industrial groups, underperformed the overall European index.
Data released on Monday indicated that the eurozone service sector grew more than expected, with Germany 
showing stronger growth than countries on the eurozone periphery.
Yet that report, as well as similarly positive data on German business sentiment released on Friday, was not 
reflected in the country's equity market.
The German Xetra Dax index rose just 0.1 per cent to 7,067.77, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 0.3 per 
cent to 1,151.18. The pan-European index had opened on a low note but got a midday boost from a solid New York 
opening.
Germany's industrial and manufacturing groups dragged on the Dax as the data released on Monday indicated 
accelerating growth in services but a slight slowing of expansion in manufacturing.
"The 'flash' January manufacturing and services PMIs suggest ongoing activity strength, with growth momentum 
shifting gradually away from manufacturing towards services," said Barclays Capital.
ThyssenKrupp , the steelmaker, fell 1.9 per cent to EUR29.39. German carmakers also lost ground. Daimler  fell 
0.5 per cent to EUR54.52 and BMW  fell 0.9 per cent to a two-month low of EUR55.23.
Consumer groups elsewhere declined, with Philips Electronics the day's worst performer. The Dutch group, which 
had reported weak television sales and lower than expected earnings, lost 5.5 per cent to EUR23.23. Overall, the 
FTSE Eurofirst 300 leisure goods sub-index fell 5.5 per cent to 2,322.14.
Swatch , the Swiss watchmaker, was one of the few groups in the index to jump significantly as it gained   3 per 
cent to SFr70.05. The group had hit a three-month low on Thursday.

The Irish market was one of the eurozone bourses to show the strongest gains, in spite of the political crisis 
unfolding in Dublin .
The country's main index was up 1.7 per cent to 2,893.37. Ryanair , the discount airline, gained 4.2 per cent to 
EUR3.61, and Elan,  the pharmaceuticals group, gained 1.8 per cent to EUR4.81.
Irish banks fell, however. Allied Irish Banks  lost 2.2 per cent to EUR0.26, and Bank of Ireland fell 1.7 per cent to 
EUR0.35.

Aer Lingus expects to operate a full schedule today, after hiring in nine planes.
The planes have been rented from other airlines, including Ryanair.
The move has come as the row over rosters, which is grounding many of the airlines own planes, continues to 
rumble on.
Two hundred cabin crew met last night with their trade union IMPACT in Dublin and decided that they would report 
for duty en masse this morning. Around 2,700 passengers suffered disruption yesterday when the airline cancelled 
34 flights to the UK and the continent. In newspaper ads this morning, the Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph 
Mueller apologises to travellers for the disruption. He says the airline's cabin crew are among the best in the world, 
but he says the blame for the current row over rosters rests with them and their union IMPACT. Mr Mueller says 
that the airline will make every effort to minimise the disruption to passenger services over the coming days by 
hiring in aircraft from other airlines to end soon. With no steps being taken, at least in public, to end the dispute, 
cabin crew who have been taken off the payroll will march in uniform to Aer Lingus headquarters today. They plan 
to hand in a letter to management giving their side of the argument.

Over 200 Aer Lingus cabin crew are marching to the airline's headquarters at Dublin airport today to tell the 
company they are ready willing and able to work.
The cabin crew staff will give a letter to Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller to say they do not understand 
why they have been turned away from work and taken off the payroll.
Aer Lingus said last night that more than 100 members of cabin crew, who are represented by the trade union 
Impact, had been taken off the payroll by management for refusing to operate controversial new rosters.
In their letter, the cabin crew state that they remain loyal to Aer Lingus but are also loyal to each other and their 
families, "whose quality of life we are trying to protect". Aer Lingus has hired aircraft from Ryanair and other airlines 
in an effort to operate a full flight schedule today as its dispute with cabin crew continues. The workers say they are 
unable to understand why Mr Mueller "preferred to waste scarce company resources to hire in aircraft and crew 
when we are reporting for duty every day". Impact said yesterday that it had submitted 28 discrimination claims to 
the director of the Equality Tribunal on behalf of cabin crew who had been removed from duties and payroll. It said it 
had asked the tribunal to investigate claims that the company's action may breach equality laws that ban 
discrimination on the grounds of family status and gender.

Over 63pc of recent graduates and industry professionals will consider emigrating to find employment in the current 
economic climate, according to new research carried out by Innovo Training and Development and the Institute of 
Technology, Tallaght.
The findings reflect this week's ESRI forecasts which indicate that net outward migration over the next two years 
will surpass the worst emigration levels experienced during the 1980s with 100,000 expected to leave our shores to 
find work over the next two years.
The online survey, which examined attitudes towards starting a business in Ireland and the current employment 
market here, found that Canada (30.3pc), Australia (28.6pc) and New Zealand (13.4pc) are the most attractive 
locations to seek employment.
Declan Byrne, director of Innovo Training and Development, said the Celtic Tiger did not kill off the long-established 
tradition of employment mobility in the Irish. "Unfortunately we have a heritage of emigration in this country, which is 
ever more evident in times of recession. The challenge for Ireland is to foster an environment of entrepreneurship 
and stimulate job creation in order to retain our highly skilled graduates and to position the country for future 
economic growth," he said. On a positive note, almost three quarters of respondents would like to start their own 
business and a majority of 62pc think that now is a good time to do so. When asked about the barriers to starting a 
business, however, half of those surveyed cited a lack of access to finance as a key deterrent. Other barriers 
included a lack of experience (40.3pc), lack of support (32.3pc) and the fear of failure (33.1pc). With regard to the 
current employment market, almost 36pc of people feel that there is too much competition for every role. 30pc think 
that the jobs market has worsened in the last six months while 24pc have seen an improvement during this 
timeframe. 23pc of respondents believe that jobs are available if you market yourself correctly but 23pc also think 
63pc of graduates consider emigration Emigration Rise
that employer expectations are extremely high. "We are losing the graduate and industry talent that we have spent 
millions educating and the only way forward is to create new enterprises that employ people and generate 
economic activity. The people, talent and ideas are here. We just need to foster, harness and support them," said 
Mr Byrne. Meanwhile, Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair is the most admired person in Irish business with 42pc of 
the vote, citing his resilience, fearlessness and outstanding leadership qualities among the reasons. Bobby Kerr, 
Insomnia Coffee and Dragon's Den Investor is the second most inspiring Irish entrepreneur along with Denis 
O'Brien of Digicel Group. "There is a definite appetite for entrepreneurship in this country. The feedback from many 
of our candidates is that they have the motivation and the drive to start their own business, but either cost or a lack 
of support services holds them back. Often all they need is the guidance and encouragement to get their ideas over 
the line. We need to bring our entrepreneurship supports to the fore and encourage our talent to stay in Ireland," 
said Pat O'Donnell, Industrial Liaison Officer at the Synergy Centre in Tallaght.

Italian financials stood out on European equity markets, helping lift the country's main stock index, which 
outperformed most of the region.
Sovereign debt concerns eased as spreads between Italian and German government bond yields narrowed.
Investors were still focused on the potential for deals in the Italian banking sector as bidders for UniCredit 's 
Pioneer asset management unit carried out due diligence.
Meanwhile, a Deutsche Bank note from Wednesday continued to resonate after it promoted stocks that had 
recently been oversold.
"UniCredit among the large caps, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena among the mid-caps and Banca Popolare di 
Milano , which is upgraded to 'buy' among the small caps," were the broker's top picks, said analyst Paola 
Sabbione.
BMPS climbed 3.3 per cent to EUR0.93, while UniCredit added 2.2 per cent to EUR1.82 but BPM slipped 0.5 per 
cent to EUR3.03, having gained 3.5 per cent in the previous session.
Also in Italy's financial sector, Intesa Sanpaolo climbed 3.5 per cent to EUR2.37 while Generali   gained 3.3 per 
cent to EUR15.49.
Overall, the FTSE MIB index of Milan-listed stocks climbed 0.4 per cent. The FTSE Eurofirst 300, however, was 
down 1.1 per cent to 1,139.63.
Dexia , the Franco-Belgian lender, was the top gainer on the Eurofirst, up 5 per cent to EUR2.95, after it said it was

cancelled flights.

Italian financials stood out on European equity markets, helping lift the country's main stock index, which 
outperformed most of the region.
Sovereign debt concerns eased as spreads between Italian and German government bond yields narrowed.
Investors were still focused on the potential for deals in the Italian banking sector as bidders for UniCredit 's 
Pioneer asset management unit carried out due diligence.
Meanwhile, a Deutsche Bank note from Wednesday continued to resonate after it promoted stocks that had 
recently been oversold.
"UniCredit among the large caps, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena among the mid-caps and Banca Popolare di 
Milano , which is upgraded to 'buy' among the small caps," were the broker's top picks, said analyst Paola 
Sabbione.
BMPS climbed 3.3 per cent to EUR0.93 while UniCredit added 2.2 per cent to EUR1.82, but BPM slipped 0.5 per 
cent to EUR3.03, having gained 3.5 per cent in the previous session.
Overall, the FTSE MIB index of Milan-listed stocks climbed 0.4 per cent. The FTSE Eurofirst 300, however, was 
down 1.1 per cent to 1,139.63.
Dexia , the Franco-Belgian lender, was top gainer on the Eurofirst, up 5 per cent to EUR2.95, after it said it was 
finalising a funding deal with La Poste, the French state-owned mail operator. Unconfirmed reports put the figure at 
EUR3bn in covered bonds.
The biggest weight on the MIB index was carmaker Fiat after rating agency Fitch said strong earnings when the 
company reports full-year numbers next week would have no bearing on its rating following the negative impact of 
the company's demerger. Fiat shares were down 3.8 per cent to EUR7.33.
Milan lifted by financials as FTSE Eurofirst slides back
Fiat Industrial , which was spun off at the beginning of the year, fell 5 per cent to EUR9.93. The truckmaker is one 
of a number of companies under investigation by the European Commission alleged to be running a price-fixing 
cartel.
Others include Sweden's Scania , which fell 2.6 per cent to SKr143.30, and Germany's MAN , which lost 3.4 per 
cent to EUR85.02.
Airline shares were lower after Britain's EasyJet said its first-half loss may double due to surging fuel costs and 
cancelled flights. Ryanair   fell 6.5 per cent to EUR3.49, the biggest loss on the Eurofirst.

Body
Aer Lingus has warned 140 members of its cabin crews they could be fired if they keep rejecting new work-
schedule rules.
Friday's threat came on the fifth day of a showdown between the airline and the Irish trade union Impact. The union 
has advised 800 cabin-crew members to refuse to accept the schedules.
Impact complains that the new rules eliminate mid-flight lunch breaks on short-haul flights and require staff to alter 
their work schedules by up to three hours at short notice.
About 200 workers marched Friday to Aer Lingus headquarters in defense of the old, less demanding work rules.
Aer Lingus has been fighting a losing battle with its chief rival, no-frills airline Ryanair. Ryanair refuses to recognize 
unions and is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder.

In line with a trend today across Europe, investors bought back some of the shares they sold in yesterday's scare 
about China overheating.
Those fears sparked fears about a new threat to world recovery.

With speculation surrounding the survival of the Government rife and amid fears for the global recovery, the ISEQ 
fell steeply this morning.
By 12:30, the index had fallen by 34.13 points to 2,859.44.
Rumours are abounding in Leinster House that the Government is about to fall following the resignations of 
ministers today and yesterday. The Taoiseach is believed to be meeting the Green Party ministers now to avert a 
new crisis. Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation Batt O'Keeffe is expected to tender his resignation from 
Cabinet today, becoming the sixth minister to step down in recent days. Mary Harney, Dermot Ahern, Noel 
Dempsey and Tony Killeen gave their letters of resignation to the Taoiseach late last night. Micheal Martin stepped 
down on Tuesday night following his failed challenge to Brian Cowen's leadership of Fianna Fail.
Inflation surged to a two-year high in December, latest official figures show, as mortgage interest and transport 
costs rose. Meanwhile, European shares fell on Thursday after data from China increased worries about further 
monetary tightening and its impact on growth, with miners and carmakers worst hit. Shares in CRH rose 6c to 
E14.79. US housing starts declined 4.3pc in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 units, below 
consensus expectations of 550,000. Building permits rose by 17pc in December to a rate of 635,000 units, the 
strongest pace since March of 2010 and well ahead of consensus estimates of 555,000. British low-cost airline 
easyJet said first-half losses might double due to higher fuel prices and tough economic conditions, after it took a 
31 million pound hit from the big freeze and strikes late last year. "The economic outlook in Europe remains 
uncertain and the higher market price of fuel will inevitably put pressure on margins in the short-term," Chief 
Executive Carolyn McCall said today. The budget carrier said the rising cost of jet fuel could increase first-half 
pretax losses to around 160 million pounds, almost double the 78.7 million pound loss it posted in the same period

last year. Shares in easyJet were 12.6 percent down at a four-month low of 397.8 pence. Shares in its bigger rival,

O'Keeffe tendered his resignation from Cabinet, becoming the sixth minister to step down in recent days. Mary 
Harney, Dermot Ahern, Noel Dempsey and Tony Killeen gave their letters of resignation to the Taoiseach late 
Wednesday night. Micheal Martin stepped down on Tuesday night following his failed challenge to Brian Cowen's 
leadership of Fianna Fail leaving a non-cabinet that Cowen tried - and failed - to fill with a new generation. The 
foreign media reacted with bemusement and some bafflement given Ireland's perilous economic state.
Inflation surged to a two-year high in December, latest official figures show, as mortgage interest and transport 
costs rose. Meanwhile, European shares fell on Thursday after data from China increased worries about further 
monetary tightening and its impact on growth, with miners and carmakers worst hit. Shares in CRH rose 6c to 
E14.79. US housing starts declined 4.3pc in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 units, below 
consensus expectations of 550,000. Building permits rose by 17pc in December to a rate of 635,000 units, the 
strongest pace since March of 2010 and well ahead of consensus estimates of 555,000. British low-cost airline 
easyJet said first-half losses might double due to higher fuel prices and tough economic conditions, after it took a 
31 million pound hit from the big freeze and strikes late last year. "The economic outlook in Europe remains 
uncertain and the higher market price of fuel will inevitably put pressure on margins in the short-term," Chief 
Executive Carolyn McCall said today. The budget carrier said the rising cost of jet fuel could increase first-half 
pretax losses to around 160 million pounds, almost double the 78.7 million pound loss it posted in the same period

last year. Shares in easyJet were 12.6 percent down at a four-month low of 397.8 pence. Shares in its bigger rival, 
Ryanair, fell 24c to E3.49. Goodbody Stockbrokers is upgrading its Glanbia forecasts following this week's 
announcement of its acquisition of Bio-Engineered Supplements and Nutrition (BSN) for dollar 144m (E108m). The 
broker is increasing 2011 earnings per share (EPS) forecast from 41.3c to 42.9c. "This would represent EPS growth 
of 17pc in 2011, some 4pc above Glanbia's own guidance - but this is mainly due to our currency forecast 
assumption of dollar to euro rate of 1.245 on average for 2011. We have re-assessed our valuation for Glanbia with 
regard to improved growth potential after this acquisition," said analyst, Liam Igoe. Glanbia's shares fell 11c to 
E3.97.

Ryanair is to appeal a ruling from a Spanish court that that its policy of charging passengers for printing their 
boarding passes at check-in is illegal.
The Irish airline said this morning that it has instructed its Spanish lawyers to appeal what it believes is a "bizarre 
and unlawful ruling" by the Barcelona Commercial Court No.1 last week that Ryanair's E40/£40 boarding card 
reissue fee is unlawful.
Judge Barbara Maria Cordoba Ardao, sitting at a commercial court in Barcelona last week, said the fines were 
abusive because airlines are obliged to issue boarding passes under aviation law.
She said Ryanair should issue the boarding cards for free. "Ryanair's low fare, low cost services appeal to millions 
of passengers because they are simple, efficient and agreed by each passenger at the time of booking. Without 
these procedures, Ryanair would have to re-employ numerous handling agents at all airports to issue manual 
boarding cards for passengers who simply "forgot" to bring their pre-printed boarding passes or who failed to 
comply with their original agreement to check-in online. We believe that the Barcelona Commercial Court No.1 has 
no basis, as a matter of contract law, for its ruling last week, that there is any obligation upon Ryanair to reissue 
boarding passes to intending passengers who have failed to comply with their agreement to arrive at the airport with 
a pre-printed boarding card, except on payment of the specified reissue fee," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara 
today.

Body
A Spanish judge has ruled that Ryanair is acting illegally by forcing passengers to print their own boarding passes.
Judge Barbara Cordoba has ruled that, under international air travel conventions, Ryanair can't demand 
passengers to arrive at the airport with their boarding pass and charge them 40 euros for failing to do so.
However, Ryanair spokesman Daniel de Carvalho has insisted that the ruling is wrong.
He said the airline would appeal the decision. Speaking in a Barcelona court, the judge said that Ryanair could 
neither demand passengers turn up at the airport with their boarding pass, nor charge them 40 euros if they did not. 
"I declare abusive and, therefore, null, the clause in the contract by which Ryanair obliges the passenger to take a 
boarding pass to the airport," she said. "The customary practice over the years has been that the obligation to 
provide the boarding pass has always fallen on the airline." Mr de Carvalho said the court was wrong, and that 
forgetting a boarding pass was almost the same as forgetting a passport. "You need the boarding card to fly. If a 
passenger arrives without a boarding card, we find an ad hoc solution to their problem," he said. "The 40 euros is a 
penalty for doing that. We serve the boarding card in exactly the same way that the passenger makes the booking, 
by internet." De Carvalho went on: "If the problem is the 40 euros charge for this service, we'll simply stop offering 
the service. That, of course, will mean the passenger who arrives without a boarding card cannot fly." The case was 
brought by Dan Miro, a Spanish lawyer whose online company, retrasos.net, takes legal action against airlines on 
behalf of passengers. Miro, who turned up at the airport in Girona, north-east Spain, in May without a boarding pass 
for his flight to Alghero, in Sardinia, and had to pay 40 euros. In the same case Miro won compensation from 
Ryanair to cover the cost of a train journey from Madrid to Barcelona after his Ryanair flight to Barcelona was 
cancelled because of volcanic ash. "I like Ryanair in some ways, but it seems to believe it can make up all the 
rules," said Miro. "It has to observe the law too. The conventions on air travel are ratified not just by Spain but by 
Ireland and the United Kingdom as well."

The ISEQ's near week-long rally ran out of steam this morning amid profit taking and despite a boost for Europe's 
shares after Spain followed Portugal with a successful debt sale.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 17.90 points to 2,916.33.
Europe's investors showed growing confidence that governments would agree bold new measures to stem the euro 
zone's debt crisis. A day after Portugal surprised many in financial markets by selling 10-year bonds relatively 
easily, Spain sold 5-year debt in the first tests of the year for the countries seen most at risk of joining Greece and 
Ireland in accepting international bailouts. A separate sale of Italian bonds also attracted strong demand. The euro 
pushed up to its highest level in a week and the risk premium investors demand to hold the debt of Spain, Portugal 
and Italy instead of Germany fell, in a sign markets are growing more bullish about the bloc's ability to address its 
economic and financial woes. "The market is seeking a turning point in the peripheral crisis," said Peter Chatwell of 
Credit Agricole CIB in London.
Bank shares were weak with AIB down 1c to E0.30, Bank of Ireland was flat at E0.36 and Irish Life and Permanent 
gained 2c to E0.90. European airline stocks recovered in 2010 (up 31.5pc) and outperformed markets. However, 
the dark cloud of rising oil prices is now on the horizon with predictions that the USD100 a barrel figure will be 
reached soon and that prices could stay at or above this figure for the year or even longer. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 
3c to E1.10 and Ryanair dropped 11c to E3.83. Home Retail Group, which operates the Homebase and Argos 
chains, issued an IMS for the 18 weeks to January 1st. The statement indicates a slight deterioration in like-for-like 
sales at Homebase, while Argos reported some improvement (although still negative). Management reiterated PBT 
guidance of £250-275m. Shares in Grafton were flat at E3.55. Polish cement sales declined by 43pc in December 
due to adverse weather conditions. This leaves full year sales up 2pc and sales in the second half of the year up 
3pc. After a weak, weather-impacted first quarter, Polish cement sales had enjoyed a strong recovery since May

with sales in the five months to end-November up 8pc year-on-year. "Poland is one of the strongest-performing 
construction markets in Europe at the moment, driven by a combination of EU-funded infrastructure and the build-
out of facilities in advance of the Euro 2012 football championship. This should prove to be one of the more positive 
markets for the three main cement producers in Poland - HeidelbergCement, Lafarge and CRH," said Davy's Barry 
Dixon.

shares after Spain followed Portugal with a successful debt sale.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 17.90 points to 2,916.33.
Europe's investors showed growing confidence that governments would agree bold new measures to stem the euro 
zone's debt crisis. A day after Portugal surprised many in financial markets by selling 10-year bonds relatively 
easily, Spain sold 5-year debt in the first tests of the year for the countries seen most at risk of joining Greece and 
Ireland in accepting international bailouts. A separate sale of Italian bonds also attracted strong demand. The euro 
pushed up to its highest level in a week and the risk premium investors demand to hold the debt of Spain, Portugal 
and Italy instead of Germany fell, in a sign markets are growing more bullish about the bloc's ability to address its 
economic and financial woes. "The market is seeking a turning point in the peripheral crisis," said Peter Chatwell of 
Credit Agricole CIB in London.
Bank shares were weak with AIB down 1c to E0.30, Bank of Ireland was flat at E0.36 and Irish Life and Permanent 
gained 2c to E0.90. European airline stocks recovered in 2010 (up 31.5pc) and outperformed markets. However, 
the dark cloud of rising oil prices is now on the horizon with predictions that the USD100 a barrel figure will be 
reached soon and that prices could stay at or above this figure for the year or even longer. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 
3c to E1.10 and Ryanair dropped 11c to E3.83. Home Retail Group, which operates the Homebase and Argos 
chains, issued an IMS for the 18 weeks to January 1st. The statement indicates a slight deterioration in like-for-like 
sales at Homebase, while Argos reported some improvement (although still negative). Management reiterated PBT 
guidance of £250-275m. Shares in Grafton were flat at E3.55. Polish cement sales declined by 43pc in December 
due to adverse weather conditions. This leaves full year sales up 2pc and sales in the second half of the year up 
3pc. After a weak, weather-impacted first quarter, Polish cement sales had enjoyed a strong recovery since May

with sales in the five months to end-November up 8pc year-on-year. "Poland is one of the strongest-performing 
construction markets in Europe at the moment, driven by a combination of EU-funded infrastructure and the build-
out of facilities in advance of the Euro 2012 football championship. This should prove to be one of the more positive 
markets for the three main cement producers in Poland - HeidelbergCement, Lafarge and CRH," said Davy's Barry 
Dixon.

Irish shares have shown some life at last this morning, after weak trading since the start of the year.
The ISEQ index was 22.71 points ahead a short time ago at 2,887.10.
The gains come as markets around the world rally on the back of better than expected results from the aluminium 
giant Alcoa, which kicked off the latest round of US earnings reports last night.
In Dublin, building materials supplier CRH is up 16c to 1465, with distribution group DCC adding 49c to 2352. 
Glanbia is up 4c to 364, Ryanair has lifted by 1c to 391 and Smurfit Kappa is ahead by 3c to 762. Elan failed to join 
the upward trand, posting a 5c fall to 520.

RYANAIR The budget carrier is on track for a showdown with UK regulators over its acquisition of a 29.8% share of 
Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. When the Office of Fair Trading opened an inquiry in October 2010, Ryanair, which had 
hoped to buy Aer Lingus outright but was forced to settle for a minority stake, insisted it had missed its chance to 
examine the deal. But the OFT now says it only delayed action to avoid clashing with a separate EU look at the tie-
up.

A US based bio-fuel company will this month decide whether it will choose Dublin to build one of the world's biggest 
"green" bio-aviation fuel plant in an investment worth a potential E200m that could create more than 1,200 new 
jobs.
According to reports in the international aviation sector, Solena - the biggest producer of bio-aviation fuel, is 
currently in talks with Qantas, easyJet, Ryanair and Aer Lingus about a potential facility in Dublin close to the 
airport.
Early last year, British Airways entered into a deal with Solena on a facility in London to produce biofuel from waste 
biomass.
The initiative is expected to create up to 1,200 jobs and if the new plant gets the go-ahead in Ireland, could have 
the potential for hundreds more jobs. Airlines are trying to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels ahead of their entry 
into the EU's carbon emissions trading scheme in January 2012 and the introduction of other new environmental 
legislation. Under the scheme, any airline flying in or out of the EU must cut emissions or pay a penalty. The

come from food scraps and other household material such as grass and tree cuttings, agricultural and industrial 
waste. It is thought the Qantas plant, to be built in Australia, will be similar. Airlines have been using synthetic fuel 
made in this way from coal for years, but this results in high carbon emissions. The use of biomass - which does not 
produce any extra emissions - as an oil substitute has more recently been pioneered by Solena. The privately

Be prepared for the return of the takeover this year

After a year of apathy towards Irish stocks, 2011 could see a surge of activity with some companies now looking 
cheap, despite their exposure to the Irish economy.
Market observers believe a number of companies could be subject to takeovers or management buyouts during the 
next 12 months as international credit lines open up.
After an unexpected boost due to the air travel problems of the Christmas period, ferry company Irish Continental 
Group (ICG) is once again being tipped for some corporate activity in 2011.
A play was made for ICG in 2007, when chief executive Eamonn Rothwell attempted a management buyout. But 
that plan was scuppered by the involvement of investment vehicle OnEUR 51, which built up a stake in the 
company. Liam Carroll later entered the fray, but the troubled developer's shareholding has since been sold off.
The company is now in a net cash position following the sale of a charter ship for EUR 37.7 million.
In the last couple of years the company has paid down debt, making the refinancing f the balance sheet very 
manageable.
Rothwell has shown that he will not easily part with the company, so a management buyout still looks like the most 
likely outcome, if a deal can be reached with OnEUR 51's Philip Lynch.
Market sources believe that financing for a deal would not be a problem, given the company's resilient performance 
during the recession and the loosening up of international credit for corporates.
Independent News and Media (INM) has also been the subject of a power struggle.
It was all quiet in 2010, as chief executive Gavin O'Reilly focused on paying down debt after a new deal to appease 
bondholders and the banks.
Be prepared for the return of the takeover this year
But shareholder Denis O'Brien has continued to rebuild his diluted stake and there is growing suspicion that he 
might make a move for the newspaper group in 2011. As the government ponders its options for asset sales, its 
stake in Aer Lingus is once again on the table for discussion.
Although Ryanair's bid for the airline was turned down before, some deals have occurred since then which could 
change the position of the EU.
Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller has said the government would only sell its 25 per cent stake to a 
party which guaranteed the independence of Aer Lingus.
C&C continues to be the subject of takeover speculation, although so far there has been little action on this front. 
But the slimmed down cider company would be an attractive add-on for an international drinks company.
The company has certainly been primed for a takeover and rumours about a suitor will persist.
This could be the year C&C finally changes hands.
Tullow Oil, although not listed in the Irish Stock Exchange, is another Irish company seen as a potential takeover 
target by a large international oil company.
As the major international oil companies, such as BP and Total, seek growth opportunities, Tullow would provide a 
ready-made, quality pipeline for the right buyer.
Tullow is one of the few independent players left in this space. On a smaller scale, there could be some 
management buyout attempts at companies such as Fyffes and Total Produce.
Their low share prices and strong cashflow might mean that management teams could easily convince private 
equity partners that it was worth coming on board.
All in all, the Irish Stock Exchange is likely to lose a few quoted companies during2 011, given that several shares 
continue to trade at low levels and not live up to their 'sum of the parts' valuations.
Norris did not publicly name the bank, though he did provide the name to Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan.
When contacted by The Sunday Business Post last year, the bank denied its Irish subsidiary was the one referred 
to by Norris in the Seanad.
A spokesman for the Central Bank of Ireland issued a statement in response to queries from The Sunday Business 
Post, after this newspaper drew transcripts of Graf 's questions in the Austrian parliament to its attention.
''The Central Bank can confirm that an inspection concerning treasury operations did take place which resulted in a 
number of issues being raised with a regulated firm, none of which involved a breach of liquidity standards," it said.
It added that, ''following queries raised by a number of sources, the Financial Regulator commissioned a third party 
report on liquidity issues which at our direction specifically examined allegations of persistent liquidity breaches''.
It went on to say: ''This was concluded in October 2010, and confirmed an earlier supervisory assessment that a 
single overnight breach had occurred.
In light of the most recent reports on this matter, we have initiated a further internal review of the file to determine 
whether any further action is appropriate in light of a risk-based assessment of the August 2007 breach. If any party 
has specific information they wish to draw to our attention in this matter it will be treated on a confidential basis."
Graf also tabled questions about the sale by Anglo Irish Bank of its  600 million Austrian deposit book to Swiss 
Bank Valartis in 2008. The curious decision by Anglo Irish Bank to sell this deposit book at a time when it was in 
dire need of deposits was highlighted in this newspaper last year.
Be prepared for the return of the takeover this year
Graf asked whether the Austrian regulatory authorities approved the 2008 sale, and whether they were at that time 
aware of allegations that Anglo Irish Bank accounts in Austria had been used to launder money for the Italian mafia.
It wasn't until 2010 that Anglo Irish Bank was named publicly in media reports as one of three banks allegedly used 
in a cross-border mafia money laundering operation.
The Italian public prosecutor's office alleged that more than  2 billion was moved from a telecoms firm in Italy to 12 
bank accounts in Vienna in Anglo Irish Bank (Austria), Raiffeisen and Bank Austria between 2005 to 2007.
The reports stated that the three banks had themselves reported their Italian clients' dealings to the Austrian 
authorities.

Spotlight on Aer Lingus as Ryanair stake probed

The decision of the Office of Fair Trading in Britain to take another look at Ryanair's position in Aer Lingus once 
again throws the spotlight on the stake and also on the future shareholding structure of the flag carrier.
It has been suggested that the state's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus could end up being among the assets sold off 
in the short term.
On the one hand, the airline is looking more attractive, with a good cash position and a resurgence in positive 
sentiment towards the airline sector.
On the other, Ryanair continues to be a major shareholder in the company and no doubt the proceedings at the 
OFT will be watched closely by potential strategic Aer Lingus investors.
The outcome of the OFT deliberations and the state's decision on the stake is very uncertain.
However, market insiders believe this is of little harm for ordinary shareholders, as it puts the possibility of corporate 
activity at the airline in centre stage, which should help bolster the share price.
The timing of the OFT investigation has irked Ryanair, which first built up a 29.9 per cent holding in Aer Lingus in 
2006. Ryanair responded to the OFT decision last week by saying it was ''out of time'' for such a review - so it would 
appeal the decision to examine the holding at this late stage.
The OFT said it opened an investigation into Ryanair's minority stake because ''it believes that it potentially raises 
competition concerns''.
The OFT indicated that it awaited the conclusion of appeals of the European Commission before starting its own 
probe. Bloxham analyst Joe Gill said that the OFT decision and Ryanair's response sets the scene for drawn-out 
discussions among various solicitors.
Spotlight on Aer Lingus as Ryanair stake probed
''The wig and gown set will now lather themselves through a variety of court cases that could extend over a number 
of years in an effort to resolve the dispute.
This Punch and Judy show will goon for some time."
But he sees little downside for investors. ''Assume for a minute that the OFT prevails and subsequently orders 
Ryanair out of Aer Lingus shares. Do you really think there would not be a corporate buyer for those?".
There are several reasons that the stake would be very attractive, he argued.
First of these is the fact that consolidation is very much alive among EU airlines.
Second, Aer Lingus's finances are rapidly improving, and third, the Irish government would like an 'Anyone But 
Ryanair' resolution to Aer Lingus's future.
A potential buyer could hoover up Ryanair's stake and if this buyer's credentials were up to scratch, they could also 
hope to acquire the state's holding.
''Conversely, if Ryanair prevails it keeps a large shareholder on the Aer Lingus register with a laser-like interest in 
generating profits. All in all, neither scenario is a major threat to exist ingequity holders," said Gill.
It could be argued that a large investor would be put off by Ryanair's presence on the shareholder register if the 
state decides to offload its holding.
But there seems to be general agreement that Aer Lingus would be appealing to a buyer.
Eamonn Hughes agreed the OFT probe could dragon, but again said it should be of little concern to ordinary 
shareholders.
''It brings back on the radar the whole issue of what Ryanair's ultimate intentions are, given it is prohibited from 
proceeding further, and whether the impasse could be broken in some way."
''So anyone with any intentions in the general direction of Aer Lingus, such as future alliance partners, might be 
watching events unfold with interest, which should be supportive of valuations."
Some in the market also believe that at current share price levels, Michael O'Leary will make another swipe at Aer 
Lingus and use more recent examples of consolidation in the European airlines sector to bolster his case.
In any case, the possibility of corporate activity at Aer Lingus in 2011 looks like a strong possibility.

EasyJet, Europe's second-biggest budget airline in terms of passengers, reported a jump in traffic for December 
just a day after rival British Airways said it expected the severe snow disruption last month to cost it £50m .
The number of seats sold at Luton-based EasyJet rose to 3.6m in December, a 7.6 per cent increase compared 
with the same month a year earlier.
BA's global passenger numbers fell 10.8 per cent over the same period to 2.1m after hundreds of its flights were 
cancelled at its home airport of Heathrow.
Freezing conditions closed a runway there for more than three days, stranding thousands the week before 
Christmas.
EasyJet was helped by the fact that it operates from the smaller London airports of Luton, Gatwick and Stansted, 
which did not suffer as much snow disruption. More broadly, however, the December figures underline the growing 
gap between BA and its budget airline rivals in Europe.
EasyJet and Ryanair, the region's largest no-frills carrier by passenger numbers, sold a combined 8.6m seats in 
December, while BA's figure for the UK and Europe was just 1.17m.
"BA's numbers were undoubtedly affected by snow," said analyst Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin. "But 
there is still a structural shift from legacy carriers to low-cost carriers. The fact that Ryanair and EasyJet combined 
are now seven times larger than BA on short-haul routes in Europe is interesting."
Ryanair also recorded a rise in traffic for December, even though its home airport of Dublin was also hit by heavy 
snow.
Its passenger numbers rose 2 per cent to 5m last month, taking its total for the 12 months to December to 72.7m.
EasyJet bookings take off in spite of snow
That is well above the 49.7m passengers EasyJet reported for 2010, and more than double BA's total.
When traffic volumes are measured by revenue passenger kilometres, which represents the number of fare-paying 
customers multiplied by the distances they fly, BA's larger number of longer international routes have long seen its 
figures dwarf those of both Ryanair and EasyJet .
BA's monthly traffic reports include both passenger numbers and revenue passenger kilometre movements, while 
Ryanair and EasyJet disclose only the more flattering passenger numbers each month.
Shares in EasyJet rose 19p to 474p on Friday, while BA shares added 4.8p to 305p and Ryanair rose 8 cents to 
EUR3.97.

The main Dublin shares index, in line with global markets, treaded water this morning as investors await key jobs 
data from the US this evening.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 3.62 points to 2,862.21.
The euro fell to a four-month low against the dollar on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data and next week's bond issues 
from euro zone peripheral countries, while world stocks and copper eased. A surprise sharp increase in U.S. private 
sector job creation in December have raised expectations of stronger non-farm payrolls for the month, with 
economists now expecting 175,000 jobs were created, up from 140,000 earlier.
Grafton has issued a brief trading update. As expected, it is short and light on detail, with only sales figures 
provided. However, the tone of Grafton's commentary remains positive. There is also the news that Grafton is in the 
process of buying ten branches from Travis Perkins. Grafton's revenues for 2010 came in at circa E2bn, despite 
what is describes as the 'extreme weather in late November and December'. Encouragingly, this is in line with our 
forecast (E2.008bn). The full-year result implies H2 revenues of circa E1.02bn, up from E980m in the first half and 
around 3pc higher than the second half of 2009. Shares in Grafton edged up 1c to E3.32. EU internal markets 
commissioner, Michel Barnier, has published a consultation document outlining draft proposals for senior bond-
holders to share the burden in future bank failures. The draft proposals suggest two possible approaches: either all 
senior bank debt issued after the legislation is enacted could be subject to write-downs, or alternatively banks could 
be compelled to issue a certain amount of debt that would be subject to obligatory 'bail-in' rules in the event of a 
bank failure. The document suggests that the broader the eligible base of liabilities, the smaller any individual write-
down may need to be, but a broad scope may also mean a larger impact on the cost of finance compared with a 
narrower scope. The new regime is unlikely to apply to creditors whose investments are secured, such as covered 
bond-holders, according to Davy Research. Shares in Bank of Ireland fell 1c to E0.33 and Irish Life and Permanent

lost 1c to E0.92 while AIB was also down 1c to E0.27. Ryanair's December passenger growth was 2pc with an 80pc

2pc. Shares in Ryanair gained 2c to E3.92.

The main Dublin shares index, in line with global markets, treaded water this morning as investors await key jobs 
data from the US this evening.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 3.62 points to 2,862.21.
The euro fell to a four-month low against the dollar on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data and next week's bond issues 
from euro zone peripheral countries, while world stocks and copper eased. A surprise sharp increase in U.S. private 
sector job creation in December have raised expectations of stronger non-farm payrolls for the month, with 
economists now expecting 175,000 jobs were created, up from 140,000 earlier.
Grafton has issued a brief trading update. As expected, it is short and light on detail, with only sales figures 
provided. However, the tone of Grafton's commentary remains positive. There is also the news that Grafton is in the 
process of buying ten branches from Travis Perkins. Grafton's revenues for 2010 came in at circa E2bn, despite 
what is describes as the 'extreme weather in late November and December'. Encouragingly, this is in line with our 
forecast (E2.008bn). The full-year result implies H2 revenues of circa E1.02bn, up from E980m in the first half and 
around 3pc higher than the second half of 2009. Shares in Grafton edged up 1c to E3.32. EU internal markets 
commissioner, Michel Barnier, has published a consultation document outlining draft proposals for senior bond-
holders to share the burden in future bank failures. The draft proposals suggest two possible approaches: either all 
senior bank debt issued after the legislation is enacted could be subject to write-downs, or alternatively banks could 
be compelled to issue a certain amount of debt that would be subject to obligatory 'bail-in' rules in the event of a 
bank failure. The document suggests that the broader the eligible base of liabilities, the smaller any individual write-
down may need to be, but a broad scope may also mean a larger impact on the cost of finance compared with a 
narrower scope. The new regime is unlikely to apply to creditors whose investments are secured, such as covered 
bond-holders, according to Davy Research. Shares in Bank of Ireland fell 1c to E0.33 and Irish Life and Permanent

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) Friday announced traffic statistics for the month of December 
2010, reporting passenger growth and higher load factor.
The airline said that December load factor rose 0.4 percentage points to 85.8% from 85.4% reported last year. Load 
factor represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers.
Passengers flown for December grew 7.6% to 3.66 million from 3.40 million in December 2009. The passenger 
count represents the number of earned seats flown, which includes seats that are flown whether or not the 
passenger turns up because easyJet is a no-refund airline. Earned seats also include seats provided for 
promotional purposes and to staff for business travel.
In November 2010, passengers grew 10.2% to 3.69 million from 3.35 million last year. Load factor improved 0.9 
percentage points to 85.7% from 84.8% a year ago.
For the rolling twelve months ended in December 2010, the airline's load factor rose 1.2 percentage points to 87.2% 
from 86.0% last year. Total passengers were 49.72 million, up 7.9% from 46.07 million in the prior-year period.
easyJet's peer Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) has reported a 2% rise in December passengers to 5 million 
from 4.9 million last year. Load factor was 80%, down 1% from 81% in the year-ago month.
Another rival and Europe's third largest airline British Airways Plc (BAY.L, BAIRY.PK) earlier this week said that 
December load factor declined 1.7 percentage points to 71.9%. Total passengers carried by the airline were 2.14 
million, a reduction of 10.8% from the same month last year.
EZJ.L is trading at 458.10 pence on the LSE, down 3.10 pence or 0.68%, on a volume of 23,172 shares.

Airline's traffic volumes fall 8.3%
Ryanair passenger numbers rise
Body
British Airways will take a hit of at least £50m from the snow that caused travel chaos in its home airport of 
Heathrow in the week before Christmas, new figures show.
BA traffic volumes for December fell a hefty 8.3 per cent compared with the same month in 2009, after snow closed 
one of Heathrow's two runways for more than three days.
The disruption stranded thousands of passengers in one of the year's busiest holiday weeks, leading to calls for the 
head of BAA, Heathrow's owner, to resign.
BA said it thought the weather problems would cost it about £50m in the third quarter and there would be "some 
small additional impact" in January because of cancelled return journeys.
The fresh financial hit comes after BA, which has only just started returning to profit after two years of heavy losses, 
suffered extra costs from a series of cabin crew strikes, bad weather and the disruption that followed the eruption of 
Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull in April last year.
Investors had been expecting the poor figures, however, and shares in BA closed up 4 per cent. Analysts noted that 
traffic in the most profitable business and first-class seats fell only 1.6 per cent in December, compared with a 9.6 
per cent slide in economy.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline in terms of revenue, said its passenger numbers rose 2 per cent in 
December, as measured by the number of booked seats, compared with the same month a year earlier.
Heathrow snow disruption set to cost BA £50m
But larger intercontinental airlines such as BA are expected to keep reporting losses as a result of poor winter 
weather on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the US, Delta said on Thursday that December's bad weather in the US and Europe had reduced its net profit for 
the fourth quarter by about $45m (£29m) from previous expectations.
The December figures brought to a sharp halt three months of steady increases in BA's monthly passenger 
numbers, as measured by revenue passenger kilometres, or the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by 
the distances they fly.
Separately on Thursday, BA said it had signed contracts to buy Rolls-Royce engines for up to 61 new wide-body 
passenger jets, including at least 12 A380 superjumbos, in the first deal the UK engine maker has inked since one 
of its engines blew apart on a Qantas A380 in November.
The BA order is worth up to $5bn at advertised prices and the manufacturer's shares rose slightly on what some 
analysts described as reassuring news, given the Qantas incident.
But others said they expected little impact from an order first announced in 2007. "More important would be a new 
win" from an airline that had not chosen an engine for the A380, said Nick Cunningham of Agency Partners.

BA says December snow and ice to cost $78 million
BA says December snow and ice to cost $78 million

Body
British Airways PLC said Thursday that the disruption to air travel caused by heavy snow and icy conditions that 
swept across Britain, Europe and North America in December December will cost the airline at least 50 million 
pounds ($78 million).
BA gave the financial hit estimate from the big freeze as it reported that passenger numbers fell 10.8 percent last 
month to 2.4 million from 2.1 million in December 2009.
BA, which made its first half-year profit for the first time in two years in the six months to Sept. 30, said it will take 
most of the financial hit from the December adverse weather in the third quarter, which ended Dec. 31.
It added there will be some additional impact in January from canceled return journeys, but maintained that 
underlying market conditions remain positive.
BA was hit hard by the adverse weather last month after heavy snowfalls closed its main hub at London's Heathrow 
Airport, stranding thousands of passengers in the run-up to Christmas. Services from other airports were severely 
disrupted.
However, the carrier's shares were trading 3.6 percent higher at 2.98 pence in afternoon trade on the London Stock 
Exchange, a sign that the market considered the impact acceptable.
While the airline reported a 9.6 percent drop in non-premium traffic, the fall in its lucrative premium traffic was 
limited to 1.6 percent. Cargo fell by 10.2 percent.
Capacity fell 7.7 percent, resulting in a small decline of 0.4 percent in the carrier's load factor, a measure of seat 
occupancy, to 76.4 percent.
The BA performance contrasted with a 2 percent rise in passenger numbers at low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings 
PLC to 5 million in December from 4.9 million a year ago. Ryanair's load factor fell 1 percent to 80 percent.

The weather glitch came just as BA was making headway after strikes by cabin crews over the summer and the 
grounding of flights thanks to an Icelandic volcanic ash cloud cost it a total of around 250 million pounds.

* AIG has received offers of up to $3 billion for Nan Shan, its Taiwan insurance unit.
* China is considering merging its two dominant state-owned railway equipment producers - China North 
Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corp and China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corp - to lead a high-speed rail 
export drive.
* Pontin's is likely to be sold soon, administrators of the failed holiday camp operator said, and is expected to be 
snapped up by a buyer keen to revive the business; KPMG said it had received 10 firm offers for the business.
* BCW Group, one of the UK's biggest debt recovery and credit management businesses, has been bought for an

* Piraeus Bank - the cash call will lift its equity tier one capital ratio by 200 basis points to a healthier 9.5%.
* Stock market forecasts - it is easy to make accurate forecasts just avoid putting a number and a date in the same 
sentence. That joke helps make sense of a consensus between a pessimist and Wall Street cheerleaders.
* Company cash - while investment bankers are, as usual, optimistic about the pipeline of mergers and acquisitions,

Irish shares have edged a tad higher this morning in a slack Dublin market.
The ISEQ index was 3.88 points ahead a short time ago at 2,873.72.
The small and uncertain rise is in contrast to more substantial gains on markets elsewhere on the back of positive

The US figures suggest that the recovery is taking hold more firmly there. In Dublin this morning, Ryanair is up by

Body
Britain's Office of Fair Trading has decided to review Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus, the OFT said today.
Ryanair currently owns 29.8pc of Aer Lingus, having initially acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in late-2006.
It then mounted a public bid for the entire shareholding in Aer Lingus in October 2006, but the European 
Commission investigated the bid and decided to prohibit it in June 2007.
"We recognise that this case raises important legal and policy issues in relation to whether competition authorities 
should be able to apply national merger control legislation whilst related appeals are ongoing under the European 
Commission Merger Regulation," Sheldon Mills, director of mergers at the OFT, said in a statement. "We believe 
that an interpretation of the law that could lead to inconsistent outcomes at national and European level risks 
undermining the coherence of merger control in the EU," he added. "We have considered this issue carefully and it 
is appropriate and fair to Ryanair to inform them, at this point, that we believe we are 'in time' to review the minority 
stake," said Mills. Ryanair said it would appeal against the OFT's decision but it was welcomed by Aer Lingus. "Aer 
Lingus welcomes today's announcement by the UK Office of Fair Trading that it is 'in time' to investigate Ryanair's 
minority shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation. Aer Lingus will continue to co-operate 
in full with the OFT in its ongoing investigation," it said.

(RTTNews) - Airline stocks are showing a notable move to the upside during trading on Wednesday, as US Airways 
(LCC) and Alaska Air (ALK) have spurred buying interest in the sector after releasing strong traffic figures for 
December.
The strength in the airline sector is reflected by the 2.3 percent gain currently being shown by the NYSE Arca 
Airline Index. With the advance, the index has risen to its best intraday level in almost a month.
US Airways is turning in one of the sector's best performances, with the airline currently up by 4.6 percent. With the 
gain, shares have risen to their best intraday price in just under a month.
The advance by US Airways comes after the airline reported that its December traffic increased by 5.7 percent to 
4.74 billion revenue passenger miles from 4.49 billion revenue passenger miles in the same month a year ago.
Seattle, Washington-based airline Alaska Air Group is also notably higher, rising by 4 percent and setting a two-
week high after its traffic numbers.
Alaska Airlines reported December traffic of 1.8 billion revenue passenger miles compared to 1.6 billion revenue 
passenger miles in the prior year period. Capacity for the period rose to 2.1 billion available seat miles from 1.9 
billion available seat miles in last year period.
In other action within the sector, American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (AMR) is up by 6.1 percent, rising to a 
monthly high.
Delta Air Lines (DAL), JetBlue Airways (JBLU)and United Continental (UAL) are also seeing gains of over 1 
percent, further boosting the sector.
On the other hand, British airline Ryanair (RYAAY) is posting a loss of 1.5 percent, falling from the two-month 
closing high it set on Tuesday.

EASYJET'S decision to convert options on 15 aircraft is good news for the company. Passenger numbers are still 
growing, up 8.2 per cent in November, while budget airlines are stealing market share from full-service carriers, 
helped by a cabin crew dispute at British Airways.
But the 15 orders represent less than a fifth (17 per cent) of the 88 options and purchase rights that easyJet has 
outstanding with Airbus. The firm should press ahead and convert yet more of these options, which were agreed in 
the downturn and come with a hefty recession discount.
Stelios Haji-Ioannou disagrees. He wants to cap aircraft numbers at 200 (compared to the 211-strong fleet that 
easyJet will fly after yesterday's announcemnt); to operate year-round routes only (rather than grounding some 
planes in winter); and to reduce the annual target for growth in seats to "GDP plus something" (as opposed to the 
current 7.5 per cent).
He is being too cautious. easyJet still has room to grow, especially compared to Ryanair, which will fly a fleet of 299 
planes by 2013. It can win share from regional players, while flying medium-haul routes like the London-Luxor 
service it launched at the end of 2010. Patience isn't always a virtue.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou , the founder of EasyJet, has fired a fresh warning shot at the no-frills airline as it pushed 
ahead with plans to buy 15 new Airbus A320 passenger jets worth $1.1bn (£706m).
Sir Stelios, who remains licenser of the EasyJet brand after settling a two-year legal battle with the Luton-based 
airline last year, said any move that increased turnover should lead to higher royalties, making the jet purchase 
"good news at least in the short term".
But as the biggest shareholder in the airline he founded in 1995, Sir Stelios made it clear he also wanted Carolyn 
McCall, its new chief executive, to ensure that the jets delivered profits.
"As the largest single shareholder in the company, I am not focused on seat capacity numbers but on earnings per 
share," he said.
"The new management team should deliver on the analysts' forecasts of increasing EPS from 28p last year to more 
than 60p by 2013, or profit after tax of more than £250m in 2013.
"We shall see if these 15 incremental aircraft will find deployment on profit-able new routes and earn the 
appropriate return on capital employed. I am still hoping to get greater transparency on which routes these and any 
other new aircraft are to be deployed."
EasyJet, which plans to increase its 193-strong fleet to 220 aircraft by September 2013, is unlikely to give rivals any 
route plan tip-offs, in spite of urgings from Sir Stelios.
Shares in the airline rose 17.6p to close at 457.6p on Tuesday after EasyJet said it would turn 15 existing A320 
aircraft options into firm orders; take options on a further 33 A320s; and convert orders for 20 smaller A319 jets into 
A320 deliveries.
Sir Stelios warns EasyJet over expansion
Analysts were not surprised. "These aircraft orders do not represent any change in strategy," said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, of RBS.
Ms McCall said the purchases would help deliver on the airline's strategy of "profitable growth towards our target of 
12 per cent return on capital employed through the cycle".
EasyJet said that although the total advertised price of the 15 A320 aircraft was about $1.1bn, it had been granted 
"substantial confidential price concessions by Airbus".   UK competition authorities said they were pressing ahead 
with plans to probe Ryanair's 30 per cent holding in Aer Lingus, more than four years after the budget airline first 
took a stake in its Irish rival.
In spite of the length of time that has elapsed, the Office of Fair Trading said on Tuesday that it believed it was still 
legally able to investigate the stake.
The competition watchdog said it did not believe it could have acted earlier because it had to wait for appeals of 
European Commission decisions relating to the shareholding. Aer Lingus has tried to force Ryanair to sell its stake, 
which it took before making a takeover bid that the commission prohibited in 2007.
Ryanair, which insists it exercises no control over Aer Lingus, said on Tuesday that it would appeal the OFT's 
"baseless claim".

A fall in passenger numbers means that Kerry Airport will have to seek 20 redundancies from its total staff of 65, the 
airport's management said today.
Kerry Airport chairman Denis Cregan said the move was necessary to safeguard the business in the medium term 
and to protect the remaining jobs.
He said the decision had been taken due to lower passenger numbers on the Dublin route and Ryanair's decision to 
end its current public service obligation (PSO) contract.
Ryanair cut its daily Kerry to Dublin schedule from three return flights a day to one from October 31 last year. A 
statement from the airport said the lay-offs would be effective from February 4, and talks on its plans were

Britain's Office of Fair Trading has decided to review Ryanair's minority stake in Irish airline Aer Lingus.
"We recognise that this case raises important legal and policy issues in relation to whether competition authorities 
should be able to apply national merger control legislation whilst related appeals are ongoing under the European 
Commission Merger Regulation," Sheldon Mills, director of mergers at the OFT, said in a statement.
"We believe that an interpretation of the law that could lead to inconsistent outcomes at national and European level 
risks undermining the coherence of merger control in the EU," he added.
"We have considered this issue carefully and it is appropriate and fair to Ryanair to inform them, at this point, that 
we believe we are 'in time' to review the minority stake," said Mills. Ryanair currently owns 29.8 pc of Aer Lingus, 
having initially acquired a stake there in late-2006. It then mounted a public bid for the entire shareholding in Aer 
Lingus in October 2006, but the European Commission investigated the bid and decided to prohibit it in June 2007.

## Eighty-five jobs are to go in Galway City with the closure of a number of businesses, all part of the Jona Group. 
The venues, which include a number of pubs, an off-licence and a nightclub, will go into voluntary liquidation. In a 
statement, company director John Grealish blamed the economic downturn and rental costs for their closures. Staff 
at the Cellar Bar, Cuba nightclub, Bar 903, and the Harvest off-licence chain were given the news at the weekend.

Face of Iseq dramatically transformed in five years
Face of Iseq dramatically transformed in five years
Sunday Business Post

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 619 words
Body
The transformation in the Irish economy in the last four years has been painful and dramatic. But nowhere has it 
shown itself more readily than in the performance and shrinkage of the companies listed on the Irish stockmarket.
The destruction of shareholder value, particularly in banking stocks, has been enormous.
But the longer-term structural changes in the make-up of the leading stocks quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange 
have now begun to show.
A number of listed companies have gone under. Others have hung in there. The turnaround in the fortunes of 
construction related shares has been well-documented, as has the collapse in bank stocks.
A comparison of the top ten Iseq stocks four years ago - at the apex of the boom years and close to the all-time 
high of the index - with now, shows that four of the companies have remained in the top ten - CRH, Kerry, Bank of 
Ireland, Elan and Ryanair.
The five new entrants are Dragon Oil, Aryzta, DCC, Smurfit Kappa and Paddy Power. Smurfit Kappa had yet to re-
float four years ago. Aryzta, which is headed by Owen Killian, was formed out of the old IAWS.
Incredibly, one of the five to continue to feature is a bank. Bank of Ireland's continued presence in the top ten has to 
be seen in the context of the government's injection of  3.5 billion in new capital, as well as the fact that, having 
successfully raised a lot of money during the summer to help boost that market capitalisation, investors have seen 
the value of their investment halve.
But AIB, now led by David Hodgkinson, and Irish Life & Permanent have disappeared from the top ten, while Anglo 
Irish Bank is in wind-down mode. AIB is set to leave the main index, as its market capitalisation stands at around  
344 million, down from  19.6 billion four years ago.
Face of Iseq dramatically transformed in five years
Companies which have proven remarkably resilient are in gambling, aviation and food. Paddy Power now makes 
the top ten with a market capitalisation of  1.4 billion, up from  769 million four years ago. On the food side, the 
Kerry Group, now led by Stan McCarthy, has a higher market capitalisation today than it had four years ago, as has 
Aryzta. The same is true of Glanbia, whose market capitalisation was  868 million four years, and now stands at  
1.03 billion.
Greencore is in the opposite situation. Its market capitalisation four years ago was  929 million, greater than 
Glanbia's at the time, but now stands at just  267 million.
Some of that deterioration has to be seen in the context of the massive valuation which the market placed on the 
company's property assets and their future development potential.
And nobody placed a higher value on that than property developer Liam Carroll, whose loans have now gone to 
Nama.
It is a credit to Ryanair that, despite all the bad news to hit the aviation sector (including the international economic 
downturn, volcanic ash, security alerts and fuel price hikes), its market value remains above  5.6 billion. It's a 30 per 
cent fall in four years, but it's only a 30 per cent fall.
The next 12 months are likely to see increased corporate activity among quoted Irish stocks, but not necessarily 
much higher volumes in terms of shares traded. There should be some renewed interest in the stock market, as 
prices for some companies may have bottomed out. But most of the action is likely to be in companies leaving the 
exchange, through buyouts and even hostile takeovers.
AIB will be the first out of the Iseq in 2011, but its shares will still be traded for cosmetic purposes on a smaller 
platform.
The level of dilution to existing shareholders will be so great by the end of February, when the state pumps another  
6 billion into the company, that it is effectively dead as a stock market entity.

Highlight: CFO of Ryanair criticizes the new aircraft sector understanding (ASU) agreement at the European 
Airfinance conference.
Body
Speaking to delegates in Dublin, Howard Millar, CFO, Ryanair, says export credit agencies are essential 
participants in airfinance.
Millar says export credit should be available for all airlines and should not be a state subsidy. "We support genuine 
exports but not as subsidies of state airlines."
Millar has several nicknames for the new Aircraft Sector Understanding (Asu): 'air sector misunderstanding', 
'airlines get screwed again' and 'protect your business'. He told the conference participants that under the new 
rules, export credit agencies will have to wind down their business.
In November Ryanair joined a group of 10 airlines called the Aviation Alliance which submitted a press release 
calling for the overhaul of export credit rules. Specifically, the group called for the removal of home market rule. It 
asked for the existing 2007 Asu rules to remain, which would mean no limit on export credits given to any one 
airline, no increase in the exposure fees, keeping the Cape Town discount and no reduction in the proportion of the 
aircraft that is financed.
Millar says the agreement would be legally challenged in the European court.
The Irish low-cost carrier has taken delivery of more than 100 aircraft during the past two years, with a combination 
of finance, including in particular Ex-Im Bank supported loans and Japanese operating leases.
"It is our view that without strong operational export credit agencies, those planes wouldn't have been delivered 
because there was no money out there."

Highlight: HSBC upgraded Ryanairâ(EURO)(TM)s rating to â(EURO)oeOverweightâ(EURO), while keeping 
easyJetâ(EURO)(TM)s â(EURO)oeOverweightâ(EURO) rating.
Body
HSBC analysts say both Ryanair and easyJet low-cost carriers (LCCs) have the potential to produce robust yields 
and returns in the next four years. The bank upgraded Ryanair's rating to &(EURO)oeOverweight&(EURO) from 
&(EURO)oeNeutral,&(EURO) while maintaining easyJet's &(EURO)oeOverweight&(EURO) rating.
&(EURO)oeWe think our forecast of yield growth of about 3% a year for the next four years may prove 
conservative,&(EURO) the HSBC analysts state in a report.
The optimistic outlook is due to several factors. Reductions in fleet expansions from both budget airlines combined 
with rising yields are expected to drive large increases in returns and cash flows.
Network carriers are also withdrawing their short-haul capacity to focus on their long-haul operations. The 
reductions help support the LCCs' yields and free slots at higher-yielding primary airports. A recovery in leisure 
travel, which is what LCCs focus on, as well as a growth in business traffic, is contributing to improving yields and 
returns, as well as.
Ryanair, Europe's largest short-haul airline, is expected to generate &,&1 billion of free cash per year by March 
2014 as capital expenditure is reduced and profitability grows. HSBC notes that Ryanair's share price performance 
has been weak, due to potential fare volatility and due to investors focusing on the larger earnings of network 
carriers.
Despite this, HSBC says it is a good time to invest in the Dublin-based carrier and has increased its target price to 
&,&5.5 from &,&4.3.The carrier's yields declined 10.6% in fiscal year (FY) 2010. However, HSBC says it is 
optimistic Ryanair will return to pre-recession levels by FY2012-2013.
EasyJet, Europe's second largest short-haul airline, has also experienced volatile share pricing partly due to its 
unsteady management issues. HSBC says it is hopeful the management issues will be resolved and the 40% 
discount on its share price will narrow.
The carrier is also slowing down its rate of capacity growth which should help lift yields and improve cash flow 
performance. &(EURO)oeConsequently, we see a strong financial performance ahead,&(EURO) HSBC says.

Body
European equities retreated in the last full trading session of the year, weighed down by data indicating that 
Chinese economic expansion was slowing.
Purchasing managers' indices showed that growth in China's manufacturing sector had slowed slightly in 
December, although the figures still showed that growth was above the long-term average.
Traders took this as a sign that China's economy might not accelerate in 2011 as fast as they had thought. This, 
partly helped by low volumes, caused export-led stocks to lose ground.
The markets in Germany, Europe's biggest exporter, saw some of the biggest losses. The Xetra Dax index lost 1.2 
per cent to 6,914.19, led by BASF , the world's largest chemicals producer by revenues, which fell 2.7 per cent to 
EUR59.70.
Frankfurt-listed ThyssenKrupp , the steelmaker, fell 1.6 per cent to EUR30.99, weighing on the Eurofirst General 
Industrials index, down 2.1 per cent to 2,659.49.
Germany's Volkswagen  fell 2 per cent to EUR121.40, along with the rest of the auto sector. The Eurofirst Auto & 
Parts index lost 0.6 per cent to 1,185.90.
Overall, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 1.3 per cent to 1,128.55, paring some of the 7.1 per cent gains that 
had been made in December and bringing the index down to its lowest level in nearly two weeks.
The Eurofirst had been on course for the biggest December rally for a decade, but that looked out of reach after the 
session's losses. Volumes were low, with only half the usual number of trades placed in the session.
Airline stocks lost ground as the International Air Transport Association reported that the growth in international air 
traffic had slowed in November, adding that the harsh weather conditions had weighed on many businesses.
Bourses finish on a flat note
Germany's Lufthansa , Europe's biggest airline group, fell 1.9 per cent to EUR16.36 on the news, while Ireland's 
Ryanair was down 1.5 per cent to EUR3.73.

Too much local knowledge can be very dangerous indeed

Section: THE MARKET

Body
The Irish equity market has been caught i n the crossfire of the turmoil afflicting the Ir ish bond market.
All Irish financial assets have been tarred with the same brush by international investors, and there is little 
discrimination between quality assets and those that are genuinely toxic.
In that context there now is, at best, major apathy towards Irish equities from institutional investors, and this 
indifference may well persist for as long as it takes Ireland to regain the confidence of the bond market - which is 
likely to be well along the four year plan to stabilise the public finances.
Consequently, those investors whose interest in equities has predominantly been in Irish stocks may now need to 
internationalise their investment universe.
However, many such investors have shown reluctance over the years to diversify equity holding outside of Ireland.
While this in part was due to the good returns generated by Irish equities in the 1993-2006 period, it also reflects a 
belief that local knowledge was an advantage in Irish equities, and concern that the risks associated with faraway 
hills were not as manageable. Looking at the first of these issues, we would challenge how valuable local 
knowledge has been.
Indeed, sometimes being too close to the ground can be a distinct disadvantage - anyone who bought Irish bank 
shares because they heard someone from one of the banks in the pub at the weekend saying everything was grand 
and there was nothing to worry about can painfully testify to this.
Also, many leading quoted Irish industrial companies, such as CRH, Ryanair, Aryzta, Kerry and DCC, have 
profitably diversified away from Ireland over the years, to the extent that inmost cases, the proportion of their 
business generated in Ireland is 10 per cent or less. In that context, Irish investors are not best placed for getting 
local knowledge about what is happening on the ground for these businesses in the US, Britain or continental 
Europe.
Too much local knowledge can be very dangerous indeed
Risk analysis on potential equity investments is critical, and just because a stock might not be based in Ireland does 
not mean that a sound assessment cannot be made on a stock, particularly if basic principles are applied. Granted, 
it is easy to get excited and bamboozled in equal measures by exotic-sounding opportunities.
For example, emerging markets promise much in terms of economic growth potential, but the valuations of many 
equities in these areas already discount much of that potential, while a lot of potential investors are correct in 
wanting to satisfy themselves on concerns over corporate governance, accounting standards and market 
regulations before jumping into emerging markets.
However, keeping things simple and sticking to basic valuation principles is a sensible way to manage the risk of 
diversifying into overseas equities.
An effective example of keeping it simple that we in Appian like is a portfolio of global franchise stocks - for 
illustration we have chosen the following half-dozen: Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle¤ , 
Unilever and Wal-Mart. These are large blue chip Companies which offer defensive growth characteristics.
They are defensive because they have scale, strong and established brands, reasonable pricing dynamics, low 
costs, and they serve markets which have robust demand characteristics.
The demand for, and the pricing and profitability of, products like Coke, Nescafe and Persil tend to perform better 
than most products during downturns.
These companies also have stronger balance sheets, with an average debt/ equity ratio of 15 per cent, nearly half 
that of the market average.
Not only does this mean that the financial risk within these stocks is lower, it enables them to better sustain dividend 
payouts, growth of dividend and investment back into their businesses.
The global franchises also offer growth characteristics by adding to their product range and expanding 
geographically.
A product acquired or newly developed by a global franchise company can reap the benefits of their massive 
distribution capability - for example, Unilever recently acquired the producerofAlbertoVO5 hair care products which 
were predominantly sold in the US and to a lesser extent in Europe, but Unilever can now use its network to 
develop markets for these products in Latin America and Asia.
Geographic growth is being successfully pursued through the penetration of new markets.
These are mostly emerging markets where the global franchises will not only benefit from fast rates of population 
growth, but will also prosper from growing demand for western and global brands as wealth levels rise.
Indeed, we in Appian would argue that with the global franchises generating significant proportions of their business 
(nearly 50 per cent in the case of Unilever) from emerging markets, they represent a low-risk way for western 
investors to get exposure to those markets. Finally, the financial characteristics of the global franchises compare 
well against the broader market.
The weighted average 2011 price/earnings ratio of the six which we have highlighted is 14.5x, based on consensus 
forecasts.
While this is slightly higher than the market average of 13.2x this premium is more than justified by the superior 
earnings growth record of the six global franchises.
These, over the past decade, have grown earnings per share by 9 per cent per annum on average compared to just 
2 per cent for the market average. The average 2011 dividend yield of the six is an expected 2.9 per cent, higher 
than the market average of 2.5 per cent.
Too much local knowledge can be very dangerous indeed
To put that in context, this 2.9 per cent yield is similar to German 10-year bond yields and just below the US 10-year 
bond yield of 3.3 per cent.
This is attractive, given that these companies have delivered average dividend growth of 13 per cent per annum 
over the last ten years, a period in which the market average has shown a decline of 3 per cent per annum.
Based on these metrics, global franchises offer a relatively low risk opportunity among international equities.
