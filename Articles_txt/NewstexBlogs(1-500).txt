 Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) scaled a 52-week high of $133.34 in the trading session on Dec 19, 2023, 
before closing a tad lower at $133.09. 
The company's shares have gained 78% year to date, significantly higher than 14.9% growth of the industry[1] it 
belongs to.

Let's find out the factors supporting the uptick. 
Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic from the 
pandemic lows. Ryanair's second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023) revenues of $5,361.3 million beat the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,137.7 million. Revenues improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger 
volumes. 
An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. Traffic grew 11% to 105.4 million 
during the first half of fiscal 2024. Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. On the back of 
the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax grew 59% year over year during the first half of fiscal 2024. 
The load factor increased to 95% in the first half of fiscal 2024 from 92% in the year-ago reported quarter. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair recently reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more passengers 
flew than a year ago. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 
2023. The reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 
2023. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in air-travel demand are encouraging. RYAAY's 
total fleet included 536 aircraft as of Sep 30, 2023. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[2] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[3] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[4]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.43% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 26.1% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 38.9% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 209.7% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

The European Union's General Court of Justice has annulled the French state aid package provided to Air France 
in 2020 and 2021. In a complaint filed by Ryanair and its subsidiary Malta Air, theGeneral Court said on 
Wednesday[1] that it can't be ruled out that not just Air France, but also KLM and the holding Air France-KLM have 
benefitted from the French aid under the EU Temporary Framework. The European Commission can appeal today's 
ruling. 
 In April 2020, weeks after the first wave of Covid paralyzed the airline industry, the French government announced 
that it would guarantee 90 percent of a (EURO)4.0 billion loan that was provided by a consortium of banks, plus 
(EURO)3.0 billion as a shareholder loan. At the time, the French State owned 14.3 percent of Air France. The 
package was approved by the European Commission in May, as it qualified for the Temporary Framework for state 
aid measures to support companies during the pandemic.

 The record-breaking traffic during the Thanksgiving period has provided a much-needed boost to the airline stocks 
in the sector after a few tough months due to headwinds like high labor and fuel costs and a slowdown in domestic 
air travel demand. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand for domestic as well as international 
flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk 
of most airlines' top lines. 
Impressive air traffic has led to a 15.6% appreciation in the Zacks Airline[1] industry so far this year. This northward 
movement compares favorably with the 11.6% rise recorded by the broader Zacks Transportation[2] sector in the 
same time frame. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic,Copa Holdings(CPA),Azul S.A.(AZUL) andRyanair 
Holdings(RYAAY) reported impressive traffic numbers for November. CPA, AZUL and RYAAY carry a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' November traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in November on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In 
November, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 11.9% year over year. Revenue passenger miles 
increased 12.4%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by 
passengers) improved to 87.4% from 87.1% in November 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul also reported year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for November 2023. AZUL's 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, 
on a year-over-year basis. The load factor came in at 79.2% in November 2023. 
On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year 
over year, respectively. The load factor came in at 78.2% in November 2023. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.6% and 33.9%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 82.5% from 79.7% in November 2022. 
Ryanair, a European carrier, also reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. 
The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more 
passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was similar in

the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 960 flights 
got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict.

Dec 19, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Boeing Company BA[1] recently received a commitment from aviation finance company Avolon for delivering 
40 of its 737-8 jets. This order remains subject to approval from Avolon's primary shareholders. 
The order, once delivered, will boost Boeing's revenues for its commercial airplane business segment, which 
recorded a solid 25% year-over-year revenue improvement in the third quarter of 2023. 737 MAX, A Solid Revenue 
Earner The 737 MAX caters to the single-aisle market with enhanced efficiency, improved environmental 
performance and increased passenger comfort. In particular, Boeing's 737-8 MAX reduces fuel use and emissions 
by 20% while producing a 50% smaller noise footprint than the airplanes it replaces. The jets also offer increased 
comfort and relaxation for passengers, with modern technologies, greater space and larger pivoting overhead 
storage bins. 
Such remarkable features must have bolstered demand for this jet family over the past few years. The latest order 
for 40 737-8 jets is a bright example of that. 
Notably, Dublin-based Avolon has been a much-valued customer for Boeing's 737 program. It ordered 40 737-8 jets 
in June and, with the latest agreement, has fulfilled its commitment to purchase 80 new airplanes this year. 
Prospects in Commercial Aviation Market With the woes of the pandemic behind us and economies across the 
globe witnessing growth once again, the demand for air travel can be expected to continue to rise in the near future. 
To this end, per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the Commercial Aviation market size is expected to go 
from $218.97 billion in 2023 to $271.96 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 4.43%. 
Such solid market growth prospects should aid Boeing, one of the biggest jet manufacturers in the world. 
Impressively, during third-quarter 2023, Boeing secured 398 net orders for commercial jets, including 150 737 MAX 
10 airplanes for Ryanair, 50 787 airplanes for United Airlines and 39 787 airplanes for Saudi Arabian Airlines. The 
company delivered 105 airplanes and the backlog amounted to $392 billion. Such developments, along with the 
company's latest agreement with Avolon, should increase Boeing's profitability in the coming days. Opportunities for 
Peers Apart from Boeing, aircraft manufacturers in the commercial aviation industry that may gain from the 
flourishing market prospects are as follows: 
Embraer ERJ[2]: The company has a huge portfolio of commercial jets. During third-quarter 2023, Embraer's E195-
E2 jet, the largest in the E-Jet family, received Type Certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. On 
Nov 29, 2023, Embraer received an order for 25 E195-E2 passenger jets from Porter Airlines. 
Boeing ( BA ) Wins Deal to Deliver 40 737 MAX Jets to Avolon
ERJ boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an 
improvement of 21.3% from the 2022 reported figure. 
Airbus EADSY[3]: In the first nine months of 2023, Airbus delivered 488 commercial aircraft comprising 41 A220, 
391 A320 Family, 20 A330 and 36 A350. In December 2023, Airbus received multiple orders - four A330-900 from 
Azul Linhas Aereas, 150 A321s and 70 A350 from Turkish Airlines, 100 A321neo from Avolon and A350F from 
Cathay Group.  
EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies 
an improvement of 12.9% from the 2022 reported figure. 
Textron TXT[4]: Its Textron Aviation business segment's principal market includes general aviation aircraft, 
business jets and commercial transportation. In October 2023, the company announced its agreement with Hahn 
Air, which is set to become the European launch customer for TXT's Cessna Citation CJ3 Gen2. The aircraft is 
expected to be delivered in 2026. 
TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an 
improvement of 6.4% from the 2022 reported figure. Price Performance In the past year, shares of BA have rallied 
38.2% against the industry[5]'s 7.7% decline.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in line for (EURO)100m after shares reach high

 The boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, is inching towards a potential (EURO)100m (86m) bonus that would be 
among the largest in European corporate history, after the no-frills airline's shares reached a record high. 
Ryanair's stock price rose to (EURO)18.99 by the end of last week, taking O'Leary closer to a threshold that could 
trigger the enormous payout. 
 Shares in the airline must either reach (EURO)21 and stay there for 28 days, or the company must report annual 
post-tax profit of (EURO)2.2bn, for O'Leary to collect the bonus, which was agreed in 2019. 
 If the stock hits the watermark, O'Leary would be given share options, the right to buy equity at a discounted price, 
according to the Financial Times, which first reported the possible bonus. 
 O'Leary would be able to buy 10m shares at (EURO)11.12 each, meaning he could pick up $210m worth of stock 
for $111.2m, scoring an instant paper profit of (EURO)98.8m. 
 The share price increase required to yield the bonus would mean the Dublin-based airline's value had more than 
doubled since August 2019, taking the company's stock market value to nearly (EURO)24bn. It is already the 
second most valuable airline in the world by stock market capitalisation, behind the US carrier Delta Air Lines. 
 O'Leary, who took over at Ryanair in 1994, has presided over the carrier's meteoric rise to become Europe's 
largest airline. During that time, he has amassed 3.9% of the company, a stake that has a market value of 
(EURO)907m. 
 The prospective new share bonus is the result of an incentive scheme agreed in 2019 that was originally due to 
expire in 2024 but was extended until 2028 in December last year. At that time, the airline's stock price was below 
(EURO)13. 
 Financial analysts predict an average share price target of (EURO)24 of the next 12 months, according to data 
from Bloomberg, which would easily put O'Leary above the threshold to collect the bonus. 
 He is less likely to achieve it by virtue of the company's profits, which Ryanair has predicted will hit (EURO)2.05bn 
at the highest for the year to the end of March, compared with the bonus target of (EURO)2.2bn. 
 Ryanair has been able to cash in on the resurgence of air travel and boom in average fares after the pandemic. It 
has said it plans to double passenger numbers[1] over the next 10 years. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in line for (EURO)100m after shares reach high
 'As long as we don't do something stupid, which is a daily challenge in this industry, we will continue to wipe the 
floor with every other airline in Europe,' O'Leary told the Financial Times earlier this year. 
 The airline said in November that it would hand shareholders regular payouts for the first time after soaring air 
fares put Ryanair on track to make record profits.

 Themes ETFs recently launched a pureplay airlines ETF, namely Themes Airlines ETF (AIRL). The resurgence of 
consumer demand post-pandemic has encouraged the issuer to launch the fund. Let's delve a little deeper. Inside 
AIRL The Themes Airlines ETF (AIRL) looks to track the Solactive Airlines Index, which identifies the largest 30 
airline companies by market capitalization. The fund AIRL seeks to provide investment results that correspond 
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the SOLAIRN Index. 
The 31-stock fund charges 35 bps in fees. Ryanair Holdings (5.02%), Deutsche Lufthansa (4.98%) and EasyJet 
(4.94%) hold the top three spots in the fund. United States (37.1%) take the top spot in the country allocation, 
followed by United Kingdom (9.4%) and Japan (9.1%). How Does It Fit In a Portfolio? The International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) anticipates a solid surge in traveler numbers and revenues for airlines in 2024. The 
sector is projected to achieve a net profit of $25.7 billion, with a 2.7% net profit margin. This forecast marks a 
modest improvement from the revised estimate of $23.3 billion net profit and a 2.6% margin for the current year,as 
quoted on CNBC[1]. 
Airports Council International too expects a rebound in 2024. The agency believes that the airline travel is projected 
to grow over 25% by 2027 relative to pre-pandemic levels. International travel is expected to contribute to the 
rebound in airline traffic. European travel giant Tui has also issued an optimistic forecast for a 25% rise in EBIT in 
2024 (read: Airlines ETF (JETS) to Surge in 2024 on Solid Travel Forecast?[2]). 
In 2024, the airline industry is set to witness a 7.6% annual increase in total revenues, reaching a historic high of 
$964 billion. The number of travelers is expected to climb to approximately 4.7 billion, surpassing the pre-pandemic 
figure of 4.5 billion in 2019. Competition The expense ratio of the newbie is 50% lower than the category average. 
This is also lower than what the only one pureplay airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS[3] charges, i.e., 60 bps. 
The fund JETS currently has an AUM base of $1.79 billion. 
Apart from this, there are transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF XTN[4] and iShares U.S. 
Transportation ETF IYT[5]. These funds, too, hold airlines stocks. These funds charge 35 bps and 40 bps, 
respectively.

Here's Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Strong Growth Stock

 Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old 
investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both. 
The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks 
#1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, 
more confident investor. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. 
With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better 
chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a 
stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value 
Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of 
upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly 
percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine 
favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks. 
Here's Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Strong Growth Stock
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio. 
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% 
average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large 
number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, 
on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still 
has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RYAAY has a Growth Style Score of A, 
forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 21.7% for the current fiscal year. 
One analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.23 to $8.87 per share. RYAAY also boasts an average earnings surprise of 18%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

 Copa Holdings, S.A.CPA[1] reported solid traffic numbers for November on the back of upbeat air-travel demand. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits in 
November on a year-over-year basis. 
To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In November, available seat miles (a measure of 
capacity) increased 11.9% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 12.4%. With traffic growth 
outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 87.4% from 
87.1% in November 2022. 
Impressive air traffic has led to an 18.5% appreciation in the CPA stock in the past year. This northward movement 
compares favorably with the 10.7% rise recorded by the Zacks Airline[2] industry in the same time frame. 
Copa Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
Given the buoyant traffic scenario, Copa Holdings is not the only airline to report impressive traffic numbers for 
November. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Brazilian carrierAzul S.A. AZUL[4] also reported year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for November 
2023. AZUL's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 8.2% and 8.7%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor came in at 79.2% in November 2023. 
On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year 
over year, respectively. The load factor came in at 78.2% in November 2023. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.6% and 33.9%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 82.5% from 79.7% in November 2022. 
Ryanair HoldingsRYAAY[5], a European carrier, also reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat 
air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 
4% more passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict.

Dec 12, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Azul S.A. AZUL[1] reported solid year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for November 2023. 
In November, the Brazilian carrier's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and 
available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year 
basis. The load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 79.2% in November 2023. 
On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year 
over year, respectively. The load factor came in at 78.2% in November 2023. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.6% and 33.9%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 82.5% from 79.7% in November 2022. 
Azul's chief executive officer, John Rodgerson, stated, 'In November, we continue to see improvements in booking 
trends in a resilient demand environment in both markets, with rational capacity deployment in the domestic and 
surpassing 2019 levels in the international. We continue excited for the strongest period of the year.' 
Impressive air traffic has led to a 58.2% year-to-date appreciation in the AZUL stock. This northward movement 
compares favorably with the 10.9% increase recorded by the Zacks Airline[2] industry in the same time frame.

Given the buoyant traffic scenario, AZUL is not the only airline to report impressive traffic numbers for November. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], a European carrier, also reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat 
air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 
4% more passengers flew than a year ago. 
The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, AZUL carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[4] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[5] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[6]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.02% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
AZUL November Passenger Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 5.1% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 19.4% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 31.5% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 194.8% year to date.

Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY 's Traffic Impresses
Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY's Traffic Impresses

Dec 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, the major news in the airline domain was the inking of Alaska Air Group's ALK[1] deal to buy 
Hawaiian Airlines for $18 per share in cash. The price represents a massive 270% premium to the closing price of 
Hawaiian Holdings HA[2] - Hawaiian Airlines' parent company - on Dec 1 (the last trading day before the deal was 
announced). The transaction is valued at $1.9 billion. This includes $900 million of Hawaiian Airlines' debt. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was also in the news, courtesy of its impressive traffic numbers for November, driven 
by upbeat air travel demand. The antitrust trial, which was debating on JetBlue Airways' JBLU[4] planned 
acquisition of Spirit Airlines SAVE[5], has ended. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Alaska Air's deal to buy 
HA is expected to be accretive to ALK's earnings within two years post-closure, with at least $235 million of 
expected run-rate synergies. In the event of the deal materializing, Alaska Air's fleet will expand to 365 narrow and 
wide-body planes. The transaction has gained approval from the boards of both companies. However, the 
materialization of the buyout is dependent on required regulatory approvals, Hawaiian Holdings shareholders' 
approval (expected to be sought in the first quarter of 2024) and other customary closing conditions. After all these 
steps, the deal is expected to close in 12-18 months. Even after the deal closure, both companies will maintain their 
respective brands[7]. 
In another development, it was announced that ALK will exit the S&P 500 index on Dec 18, 2023. The airline will 
move down to the S&P SmallCap 600. 
2. The number of passengers ferried on Ryanair flights in November was 11.7 million, marking a 4% year-over-year 
rise in passengers. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. 
The reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. 
However, more than 960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. 
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[8]. 
3. The trial in which the U.S. Department of Justice urged a federal judge to block JetBlue's intended $3.8-billion 
acquisition of Spirit Airlines in an effort to preserve competition among the lowest-cost carriers has been wrapped 
up. The federal judge may allow the merger to proceed if JetBlue divests more assets. Per a Reuters report,[9] U.S. 
District Judge William Young told a JetBlue lawyer that he expected airline fares to rise if no-frills, ultra-low-cost 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY 's Traffic Impresses
Spirit no longer was around to "undercut everyone else" and drive down prices. The judge, who will decide the case 
in the non-jury trial in Boston, told both parties that he was having "trouble" with the Justice Department's request 
for a permanent injunction blocking a deal in a "dynamic industry facing unique opportunities and challenges in the 
post-COVID environment." Price Performance The following table shows the price movements of the major airline 
players over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that almost all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. Consequently, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index improved 12.2% to $62.3 over the past week. Over the course of six months, the sector 
tracker has decreased 6.1%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more passengers 
flew than a year ago.

similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got cancelled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 60.7% so far this year compared with 6.6% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. Passenger volume has been 
robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic. The company recently reported 
second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023) revenues of $5,361.3 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $5,137.7 million. 
Revenues improved year over year driven by upbeat passenger volumes. Further, traffic grew 11% to 105.4 million 
during the first half of fiscal 2024. On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax grew 59% 
year over year during the first half of fiscal 2024. Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[4] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[5]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.02% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 5.1% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 17.3% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 31.5% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 181.3% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) November Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's credited with a 'watershed medical breakthrough' and is developing a bustling pipeline of other projects that 
could make a world of difference for patients suffering from diseases involving the liver, lungs, and blood. This is a 
timely investment that you can catch while it emerges from its bear market lows. 
 It could rival or surpass other recent Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in 
little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top Stock And 4

 This is true of booze, of drugs, of tobacco and, yes, jet engine parts[1]:  
Ryanair has found 'fake parts' in two of its aircraft engines during scheduled maintenance checks, becoming the 
latest airline to be impacted by a brewing scandal. 
The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been 
removed from the engines, the low-cost carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary told Bloomberg News. 
It comes as the global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators 
scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment. 
We do not, of course condone this. But we do know quite a bit about it as a result of having been out there in that 
international and global economy for all these decades.  
The difficulty is that the nut, bolt or screw for a jet engine is worth 5x to 10x with the right piece of paper than it is 
without. Let's not make the situation more complicated than that. It's righteous that it should too, traceability of parts 
in something so complex, so horrendous in effects if failure occurs, is a very good idea indeed. 
But, it's always going to happen that people will try to trade across a 5x to 10x price difference. Note that this is not 
a result of markets or capitalism. This isn't neoliberalism run riot - this is just what happens among humans. This 
also doesn't mean that people who do even fake jet engine parts should not be righteously jugged, not that we 
should not investigate allegations of it - as here, allegations only so far. 
What it does mean is that governments simply cannot go around creating 5x and 10x price differences as will be 
true of banning tobacco and so on. Because people simply will trade across those differences. As they do with 
drugs, at large scale, and as currently also does happen with both tobacco and booze.  
With jet engines the consumers - the airlines - absolutely do not want fake parts at any price. For knowing use of 
them would likely violate both their insurances and also their licences. Now switch the model to one where 
consumers do desire the item on offer - drugs, booze, baccy. There is that demand, there is that profit margin, trade 
will happen across it. 
This then being the message for the prohibitionists. Even if it were true that society would be better without these 
things - it wouldn't - it still won't work. And there's absolutely no point at all in implementing a policy that won't work. 
So, don't.

Cullwick: Consumers want to interact on their terms 
Good customer service should be a priority for any business and, if you want to stay ahead of the competition, 
something that's constantly under review. 
According to a recent Salesforce report[2], 80% of customers now consider their experience with a company to be 
as important as its products. This is particularly important if you're not able to compete on price. 
Brands such as Ryanair may have built their business on being cheap, but if you cannot undercut competitors, then 
you need to focus your efforts on making sure that your service stands out. 
Reviews and feedback forms will help you gauge satisfaction levels, but if you want to take a more proactive 
approach, then I'd recommend giving customer journey mapping a try. 
Get connected 
If the process is new to you, then the Salesforce report is a good starting point. Now on its sixth annual edition, the 
global survey of more than 14,000 customers and business buyers provides a useful snapshot of behaviours and 
trends to watch out for. 
It says that 69% of consumers want to talk to a company in real time, for example, while 84% consider it crucial that 
they are treated like a human and not just a number. 
Consumers' number one frustration with organisations is disconnected experiences, it says, so isn't it worth 
reviewing your own offering? 
Customer journey mapping helps you to see your business through a customer's eyes. The idea is that you map out 
the touchpoints and then create user journeys for each type of client, which helps you to see what happens and 
when, and what you are missing. 
There is software for this, but you can also do the mapping manually using a pen, a pack of Post-it notes and as 
much information about your customers as you can find. Google Analytics is a great place to start, but you should 
also gather any other available data, such as from customer reviews, complaints, feedback forms and, crucially, 
colleagues, especially any in customer-facing roles who may have valuable insight to add. 
How a good customer journey can put your business on the map
Identify any pain points - a particular website page with a high drop-off rate, for example - potential solutions to the 
problem and next steps to put them into practice. 
Finally, make sure you follow-up to see if the measures implemented have been effective and repeat the mapping 
exercise regularly as consumer habits can and do change. 
Touchpoints 
What the common touchpoints are has changed significantly in the last few years and particularly since the Covid 
pandemic, which saw more communications move online. 
Consumers want to interact on their terms with live chat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and other social media 
channels increasingly becoming the chosen points of contact rather than traditional email or phone. 
A common disconnect in many companies is that staff who handle new phone or email enquiries do not have 
access to social media accounts so that they can also respond to enquiries through those channels in real time. 
Not only do you need to ensure you are using all your routes to market to attract prospective clients, but that when 
they do get in touch, you are ready to respond via whichever channel they prefer. 
Consumers hold more power now than ever and if you are not backing up your marketing efforts by focusing just as 
much on what happens when people do contact you then you will learn this the hard way.

Nov 15, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Zacks Airline [1]industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand following the easing of COVID-19 
travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand 
for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger 
revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[2], Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes 
GOL[3], Azul S.A. AZUL[4] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported impressive traffic numbers for September 
2023. CPA, GOL and RYAAY each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). AZUL is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' October traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in October on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In October, 
available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 12% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 
10.2%. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 87.6% for October 2023. 
Gol Linhas reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for October 2023. 
In October, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) increased 2.6% on a year-over-
year basis, while available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) fell 1.2%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity 
expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for October 2023 improved to 84.5% from 
81.4% in October 2022. The number of flight departures at GOL in October registered a 3.1% year-over-year 
increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 8.6% year over year. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (4.7%) outpacing available seat kilometers (1%), the load 
factor increased to 84.6% from 81.6% in October 2022. Internationally also, the load factor increased to 83.4% from 
79.7% in October 2022. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 3.5% on a year-
over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 4.7% in October. On the domestic front, 
passengers on board rose 9% year over year. 
Azul reported double-digit year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for October 2023.

In October, the Brazilian carrier's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available 
seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 13.7% and 8.4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With

Nov 10, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and 
revenues for third-quarter 2023. The results were hurt by the year-over-year decline in air traffic apart from the rise 
in fuel costs. Average fuel price per gallon increased 6.5% sequentially in third-quarter 2023. Latin American carrier, 
Gol Linhas GOL[2] reported a loss in the September quarter. 
Fortunes were brighter for European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], which reported better-than-
expected earnings per share and revenues for second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023), driven by upbeat 
passenger volumes. Riding on the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, another Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[4] 
reported rosy traffic numbers for the month of October. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Low-
cost carrier Allegiant reported third-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding $1.53 from non-recurring items) of 9 cents per 
share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents but surged more than 100% year over year. 
Operating revenues of $565.4 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $583.7 million but increased 
marginally on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk (91.3%) of the top line, 
remained flat on a year-over-year basis. Management now expects 2023 earnings per share (airline) in the $7.75-
$8.50 (prior view: $10.50 - $13.00) range. 
Updates on the third-quarter earnings report of another low-cost carrier, JetBlue Airways JBLU[5], are available in 
the previous week's write-up[6]. 
2. Gol Linhas incurred third-quarter 2023 loss of 25 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
earnings per share of 4 cents. In the year-ago quarter, GOL had incurred a loss of 75 cents. Net operating revenues 
of $956 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $974.4 million. Management now expects [7]capacity to 
increase 10%-15% year over year in 2023. 
Currently, Gol Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
3. Ryanair reported second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share of $7.21, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $7.13 and improved year over year. Revenues of $5,361.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
of $5,137.7 million. Average airfare, which rose 24% in the first half of fiscal 2024, is expected to rise year over year 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Q3 Earnings Miss, GOL 's Loss & More
by mid-teens percentage in the fiscal third quarter. Management expects [9]fiscal 2024 traffic to be 183.5 million. 
Profit after tax is anticipated in the range of €1.85 billion and €2.05 billion for fiscal 2024. 
4. For the month of October, Azul's consolidated traffic increased 13.7% year over year. To match the increased 
demand situation, AZUL is expanding its capacity. In the same period, capacity grew 8.4% year over year. Since 
traffic growth was more than capacity expansion, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased 3.9 
percentage points to 81.1% last month. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the

Nov 10, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Azul S.A. AZUL[1] reported double-digit year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for October 2023. 
In October, the Brazilian carrier's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available 
seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 13.7% and 8.4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With 
consolidated passenger traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 81.1% from 77.2% in October 2022. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (7.6%) outpacing available seat kilometers (3.1%), the 
load factor increased to 78.6% from 75.3% in October 2022. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 37.5% and 31.8%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 89.8% from 86.1% in October 2022. 
Azul's chief executive officer, John Rodgerson, stated, In October, passenger demand grew 13.7% outpacing our 
capacity growth as we continue to see a robust demand environment in both domestic and international markets. 
Recent booking trends are strong and we are very excited about the revenue potential for the upcoming months as 
we entered in the seasonally stronger period of the year.' 
Impressive air traffic has led to a 45% year-to-date appreciation in the AZUL stock. This northward movement 
compares favorably with the 4.9% decline recorded by the Zacks Airline[2] industry in the same time frame.

Ryanair HoldingsRYAAY[3], a European carrier, also reported impressive traffic numbers for October 2023, driven 
by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in October was 17.1 million, 
implying that 9% more passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) 
came in at 93% in October 2023. RYAAY operated more than 96,700 flights in October 2023. Zacks Rank and 
Stocks to Consider Azul currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[4] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[5] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[6]. Each stock carries a Zacks 
Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 20.99% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
AZUL October Passenger Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 11.6% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year 
earnings has improved 18.4% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 160% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

Nov 09, 2023( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Airlines are making huge profits from a global travel boom that's keeping airfares at high levels. Travelers are 
asking if the ticket prices will come down. Many others believe they need to be even higher.Life has gotten more 
expensive since the pandemic but few things have risen as much as the price of flying. 
Anyone who has bought a flight in 2023 will know it already but the EU confirmed last month that average airfares 
across Europe were between 20% and 30% higher in summer 2023 compared with 2019. 
It's a global issue that has been building since early 2022. In February 2023, data from aviation analytics company 
Cirium revealed that average ticket prices for hundreds of the world's most popular routes had risen by 27.4% from 
early 2022, when prices were low as pandemic-hit airlines looked to entice travelers back to the skies. 
Although inflation has soared in many countries since then, the increase in airfares when compared with the pre-
pandemic period comfortably exceeds national rates of inflation during that time. 
This week, EU Commissioner for Transport Adina Valean told the Financial Times that Brussels was now looking 
into the issue to find out, "what is exactly going on in the market and why." 
Lots of reasons have been given by airlines, from surging demand for travel, to disrupted supply chains for 
everything from planes themselves to the seats that fill them. 
Yet many say high prices for flights are here to stay and that in itself need not be a bad thing, given the industry's 
major carbon footprint. 
The old price drivers - supply and demand 
There are two major reasons behind the dramatic rise in the price of flights: increased demand and disrupted 
supply. 
For two years, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the industry. With planes grounded around the world, 
the sector's combined losses in 2020 and 2021 were at least $200 billion ((EURO)187 billion) according to the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade body. 
Just as the pandemic brought flights to a dramatic halt, the return to normality has driven a remarkable travel boom. 
Throughout 2023, practically all of the world's major airlines have been posting record profits as they rush to keep 
up with huge demand. 
Ryanair, Europe's biggest carrier by passenger numbers, said this week it expects to make a record profit of up to 
(EURO)2 billion ($2.1 billion) in the current financial year. Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, IAG, Air-France-KLM, 
Emirates and American Airlines are among those who have been posting stellar results this year. 
Airfares are sky-high - is that a good thing?
IATA said in June it expects the airline industry's total revenues to top $800 billion for the first time since 2019.  
Airlines say that while the demand is helping them score record profits, their own lack of capacity has forced them 
to ramp up prices. Supply chain snarls in the sector have led to delays at Airbus and Boeing, who are struggling to 
meet airlines' demands for new planes and parts. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said this week the delays at the two major aircraft makers are a major cause of 
higher prices. He told investors on a call this week that he expected some airlines to be forced to slash capacity in 
2024 due to supply issues. He expects prices to continue to rise as a result. 
It's not just supply chain troubles either. Airlines are grappling with their own increased costs amid staffing problems 
at airports that have also increased since the pandemic, prompting airport operators to cut capacity. 
However, according to Karolina Wojtal from the EU's European Consumer Centres Network, airlines are 
themselves allowing prices to rise higher than the rate of inflation. 
"The airlines are also automatically pushing up prices with their booking systems because people really want to 
travel again after the coronavirus," she told DW. 
The question of price-gouging has been leveled at airlines, with some accusing them of trying to offset the huge 
losses they suffered during the pandemic by overcharging now. Airlines deny it, saying prices are an accurate 
reflection of the current state of the industry. 
Will airfares ever fall? 
With the supply chain problems expected to persist for some time, and the travel boom showing little sign of 
abating, prices are not going to fall any time soon. 
Another issue that could further drive up prices in the years ahead is the potential costs for airlines as they turn to 
costly sustainable aviation fuels. The aviation industry has a major carbon footprint and is under pressure to reduce 
it as soon as possible. 
Willie Walsh, the director-general of IATA, said earlier this year that he expected fares to keep rising over the next 
15 years due to the higher costs of more sustainable fuels. "It will mean higher fares because sustainable aviation 
fuel is more expensive than your traditional jet kerosene. And as we transition to net zero, it is going to cost some 
money," he said. 
Should airfares be regulated? 
Environmental groups have argued that higher air travel costs could help cut the growth of air traffic and would help 
to both fund the green transition and reduce emissions in the shorter term. 
Jon Worth, a railway transport analyst based in Germany, says the travel boom of 2023 has also seen a huge 
increase in people opting for less polluting methods of transport, such as rail, but he says something needs to be 
done with prices to discourage excessive travel by plane. 
"We have to ask what sort of price structure would make sense with regard to trying to discourage those extremely 
frequent flyers who make up an enormous amount of your airline passengers," he told DW.  
For him, that means a range of things, from increased taxes on kerosene fuel for airplanes to a frequent flyer tax 
and from increased landing charges for airlines at airports to less direct government support for the sector. 
"We all have to fly less and flights have got to be more expensive in the medium to long term because that should 
act as a way of discouraging people from flying so much," he said. 
In her interview with the Financial Times, EU Commissioner Valean said she had no plans to intervene in the 
aviation market but would seek a "detailed explanation" from airlines about rising airfares. 
Some governments have sought to intervene though. The Italian government announced plans in early September 
to cap airfares between mainland Italy and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia after prices soared in the summer. 
However, after a fierce backlash from airlines, led by Ryanair, the government pulled back. 
France is looking to set an opposite course. The country's transport minister said recently he is seeking support 
from other EU nations to set minimum prices on flights within the EU, to try and help curb emissions. He says a 
debate is needed on the "social and environmental price of a flight ticket."

Nov 08, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Care to share? Last week, AirInsight published an estimate[1] of the value of Airbus's advantage in the single-aisle 
market.\xC2 There were two key numbers: AirInsight estimated Airbus has an average of $2.7m per aircraft delivery 
and that Airbus has, between January 2021 and the end of October 2023, accrued $27Bn in value. 
The data used for this estimate combined AirInsight's delivery tracker and current market values from ch-Aviation. 
The numbers are eye-popping. 
AviationValues,[2] a London-based values and data provider, collaboratively provided a fresh dataset to work with. 
All AviationValues values and data are updated daily. The values are calculated using a sophisticated algorithm that 
translates real transaction pricing into values, supplying a more accurate and detailed view of the delivery picture. 
AirInsight decided to see if there is any appreciable difference. 
Let's lay out the data. AviationValues provided the following table of values and volumes. 
AviationValues 
In our initial estimate, as seen below, we estimated Airbus had a $2.7m value advantage per aircraft delivery, based 
on generic average market value figures, which summed to over $27Bn over the period. 
AirInsight 
Using the same logic but with AviationValues data and values, here's what we have now. The Airbus advantage 
rises to $5.5m per delivery and sums to nearly $32Bn. 
AirInsight AviationValues 
Notice the number of deliveries varies between the two sources. Also, the difference in approach to the MAX 8: 
AviationValues does not assess a value premium to the MAX 8-200 variant on the basis that it accounts for less 
than 10% of the current MAX 8 fleet and is almost exclusively concentrated with one entity (Ryanair). 
In terms of delivery figures, AviationValues numbers are slightly lower for Airbus and slightly higher for Boeing than 
our initial estimate.\xC2 However, the values are averaged across and aggregated from delivery value figures by 
year of delivery. This specificity results in a total accrued value 17% higher than estimates based on generic 
averages. 
The Implications What are the implications of this data? 
Estimating the value of Airbus Single-Aisle Market Advantage
Airbus has, by either data source, a substantial market and financial advantage. The following chart illustrates the 
point.\xC2 Based on AviationValues' cumulative delivery data, Boeing's MAX 8 delivery volumes are leading.\xC2 
But both Airbus models are not far behind, and the A321neo has started to overtake its smaller sibling. 
The financial advantage is fundamentally due to Airbus' dominance of the higher capacity segment: the A321neo 
clearly outperforms the MAX 9 in terms of deliveries, and its competitor, the MAX 10, has not yet been certificated. 
AviationValues assesses approximately $10 million in incremental value per aircraft between the MAX 8 and MAX 9 
or between the A320neo and A321neo. So, for every A321neo Airbus delivers, the revenue advantage widens. 
AirInsight AviationValues 
AirInsight AviationValues 
The two charts help explain why Boeing is anxious to get the MAX 10 certified. Without the MAX 10, Boeing has no 
competitive product to capture a share of the A321neo's market. 
The MAX 10 is the MAX model with the second highest orders after the MAX 8, so there is apparent demand for a 
competing high-capacity Boeing single-aisle product. But Boeing must bring the MAX 10 to market first before it can 
crystallise that interest. 
And in the meantime, Airbus is not standing still, with the more capable A321neo LR variant in service and the XLR 
nearing certification. At present, the A321neo backlog alone is larger than the backlog for Boeing's entire MAX 
family, which means Boeing has some significant catching up to do. 
The interest in high-capacity single aisles like the MAX 10 and A321neo highlights a potential issue - what happens 
to MAX 9 values and demand? Will it be squeezed on either end? That's going to be one to watch. 
The data suggests that Airbus enjoys a tremendous market advantage in the single-aisle segment.\xC2 
AviationValues' fleet and values data shows this is mainly due to the success of the A321neo: Airbus has been able 
to capitalise on a market need in that segment, and Boeing has not. 
This advantage is already worth about $30Bn.\xC2 To put that number in perspective, $30Bn could fund a new 
aircraft program. At present, the A321neo backlog alone is larger than the backlog for Boeing's entire MAX family, 
so barring some unforeseen event that suddenly tips the scales in Boeing's favour, we would expect this advantage 
to persist for some time even after the MAX 10 enters service.

Despite a number of headwinds,\xC2Ryanair[1] is expecting this financial year 2024 to end with a profit after tax of 
between €1.85 and €2.05 billion, up from €1.43 billion reported over FY23. While forward bookings look good and 
fares are up by a mid-teen percentage, the first months of 2024 offer little visibility. Going into next year, Ryanair is 
concerned the most about\xC2delayed aircraft deliveries[2] and rising fuel costs. 
Ryanair reported a €2.178 billion net profit for its first half year from March to September, up from €1.371 billion in 
the same period last year. Revenues were up to €8.575 billion from €6.616 billion. Passenger revenues grew by 37 
percent to €6.074 billion from €4.425 billion and ancillary revenues by 14 percent to €2.501 billion from €2.191 
billion. Expenses were up by 24 percent to €6.159 billion, with fuel costs up by 29 percent to €2.815 billion. Staffing 
costs were also up, reflecting the pay restoration that Ryanair promised last year, having cut back wages during the 
pandemic. The operating profit was €2.416 billion, up from last year's €1.546 billion.

 Mohammed Shiraz Riaz, aged 42, of West Yorkshire, was jailed for 14 months for drunkenly hurling racist and 
misogynistic abuse towards women on two flights back to Britain. 
The first incident happened on July 15, 2019, when Riaz began drinking Jack Daniels with cola as he sat on board 
a Ryanair flight from Morocco to Liverpool John Lennon airport from Morocco. 
According to stewardess Jelena Zuravska, trouble began when Riaz demanded another drink. 
When she said she was busy, he went to the toilet muttering 'f***ing fat b**** stewardess'. 
Ms Zuravska said: 'I remained professional and suggested that he sat down and have something to eat and at this 
point, I made the decision not to serve him any more alcohol as I didn't want to make the situation any worse. 
'But he started verbally attacking me personally, saying 'who f***ed your mother, you fat stewardess white b****'. 
'He seemed to have a real hatred towards women. He was shouting, he was screaming. He gave me the feeling he 
was going to fight me. 
'As he became more aggressive towards me and more vocal, other passengers stepped in to try and calm the 
situation. One even wanted to punch him on my behalf.' 
Riaz even used the safety announcement she made during the descent as 'an opportunity to further humiliate' her 
as he shouted 'look at that fat f***ing b****' and blew raspberries shouting 'look she's farted'. 
The crew were eventually forced to move other passengers from seats near Riaz. Related Reads 
Police at Liverpool were faced by a 'clearly upset' Ms Zurvaska with Riaz standing behind her holding a black 
holdall. 
As other passengers applauded his removal from the plane, Riaz presented his wrists to officers and said: 
'You may as well handcuff me now. I've done f*** all wrong. That fat b**** has called you to make me look stupid. 
F***ing fat b****.' 
Riaz later bit a policeman, leaving him with teeth marks on his arm. 
In the police interview, Riaz said he had taken Tramadol and two ibuprofen tablets with alcohol and claimed the 
allegations against him had been exaggerated. 
The second incident occurred on January 2, 2021, when Riaz was returning from Istanbul to Manchester. 
During the flight, Riaz drunkenly shadow-boxed in the aisles and punched the seats. 
Plane Passenger jailed for Drunken Tirade of Misogynistic Abuse
He hurled a torrent of sexist and racist abuse towards cabin crew, fellow passengers, police and female airport 
officials. 
When he was subsequently thrown off the plane, he unleashed a tirade of abuse at a female Border Force official, 
saying: 
'You f***ing b**** I bet you didn't get your leg over last night. You need a good s**g.' 
And as he was led away to the cells, Riaz shouted: 
'F*** you slag - I'll punch your f***ing head in.' 
As he was placed into a police van, Riaz continued: 
'No wonder it's so easy for us to rape your white children - you're all a bunch of p******. 
'You f***ing s***s, fat-a*** c****. White women are easy to rape. White children are easy to rape because white men 
are p******.' 
Police bodycam footage showed Riaz squaring up to another passenger at passport control before being told to 
stop swearing as children were nearby. 
One officer told Riaz: 'You might not like us but these children do not deserve this - you stink of booze.' 
Riaz replied: 'I won't shut the f*** up. You're a fat mother f***er. Why should I f***ing shut up?' 
Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard Riaz had 30 offences for drink-related thuggery, including assault 
on police and being drunk and disorderly. 
In 2019, Riaz was convicted of criminal damage after he smashed up a camper van and two hotel rooms but he 
was freed with a community order. 
He admitted being drunk on an aircraft, assaulting an emergency worker and four charges of using threatening 
behaviour. 
Riaz was not charged with any racially aggravated offences. 
In mitigation for Riaz, Ella Embleton said: 
'He recognises there is no excuse for his behaviour and describes himself as behaving like a 'Dog'.' 
'He is very embarrassed by his actions on these two days. 
'His underlying problem is alcohol. When he has one drink he goes on to binge drink and he gets carried away. The 
behaviour he displays when he is intoxicated is not reflective of the man he is when sober.' 
Judge Joanne Woodward told Riaz: 
'This was a sustained course of highly abusive conduct causing distress to others. 
'The level of verbal abuse in the presence of families and young children was at the highest end.' 
Riaz was jailed for 14 months.

This forms part of the MoU agreement between the companies, providing Ryanair with unique access to purchase 
up to 160,000 metric tons of SAF from OMV up to 2030. 
For OMV, the agreement represents another step towards raising the production of sustainable fuels and chemical 
feedstock to 1.5 million metric tons per year by 2030. 
Martijn van Koten, OMV executive vice president Fuels & Feedstock, said: 'We are building a growth business for 
SAF to support the industry's journey towards a more sustainable future. We are proud of our partnership with 
Ryanair that allows both companies to leverage their expertise in promoting the use of SAF. This facilitates the 
transition towards the application of more sustainable forms of energy and helps reduce the climate impact of 
aviation.'

 In Ireland, Ryanair purchased 500 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from OMV. This agreement will 
save over 1,250 tons in CO2 emissions (equivalent to c.100 Ryanair flights from Dublin to Vienna). 
This purchase follows on from the MoU agreement made between the companies last year, providing Ryanair with 
unique access to purchase up to 160,000 metric tons of SAF from OMV up to 2030. 
Ryanair has committed to its 12.5% SAF use by 2030 target, as well as the airline and OMV's ambition to achieve 
net-zero emissions by 2050. Ryanair has already significantly advanced these commitments by partnering with 
Trinity College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, investing $22bn in its 
'Gamechanger' fleet, which reduce CO2 emissions by 16% and a further $40bn investment for 300 Boeing 737 
MAX-10 aircraft which reduce CO2 emissions by 20% while carrying 21% more passengers.

 The Zacks Airline[1] industry has been benefiting from buoyant air-travel demand, following the easing of COVID-
19 travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in 
demand for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher 
passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[2], Azul S.A. AZUL[3], Gol Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes GOL[4] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported impressive traffic numbers for September. 
Each of these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks 
#1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Let's Take an In-depth Look at These Companies' September Traffic Reports 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in September on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In 
September, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 13.6% year over year. Revenue passenger 
miles increased 14.1%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 87.3% from 86.9% in September 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul reported double-digit year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for September 2023.

kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 18.7% and 15%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With 
consolidated passenger traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 81.7% from 79.1% in September 2022. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (10.6%) outpacing available seat kilometers (7.4%), the 
load factor increased to 79.4% from 77.1% in September 2022. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 51.1% and 49.7%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 89.1% from 88.3% in September 2022.

How to Find Strong Transportation Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises

Surprises

Oct 11, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the 
latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. 
Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while 
falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by 
finding positive earnings surprises. 
Now that we know how important earnings and earnings surprises are, it's time to show investors how to take 
advantage of these events to boost their returns by utilizing the Zacks Earnings ESP filter. 
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained 
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings 
revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release 
date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to 
have more information. 
The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the 
resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The Zacks Rank is also 
factored into the ESP metric to better help find companies that appear poised to top their next bottom-line 
consensus estimate, which will hopefully help lift the stock price. 
When we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-
line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, 
according to our 10 year backtest. 
Stocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line 
with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of 
stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank. 
Should You Consider Ryanair? 
How to Find Strong Transportation Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the 
bill. Ryanair (RYAAY) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.23 a share, just 26 days 
from its upcoming earnings release on November 6, 2023. 
By taking the percentage difference between the $7.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.13 Zacks Consensus 
Estimate, Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of +1.29%. Investors should also know that RYAAY is one of a large group 
of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter[1] to uncover the best stocks to buy or 
sell before they've reported. 
RYAAY is one of just a large database of Transportation stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is 
Alaska Air Group (ALK). 
Slated to report earnings on October 19, 2023, Alaska Air Group holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and 
it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.90 a share eight days from its next quarterly update. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alaska Air Group is $1.88, and when you take the percentage difference 
between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +0.66%. 
RYAAY and ALK's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations 
in their next earnings report. 
Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported 
Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, 
surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here  > >[1]

Why airlines are perfect targets for anti-greenwashing legal action

Oct 09, 2023( Climate Home News: http://www.climatechangenews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 A wave of anti-'greenwashing' litigation[1] is seeking to hold major players in the aviation industry to account for 
sensational claims of being sustainable, low-carbon or contributing to net zero. 
While the industry has faced legal backlash in the past, the dramatic proliferation of these cases may spell disaster 
for major airlines. 
It's not hard to see why the aviation industry has provoked the ire of climate activists. Flying is responsible for a 
staggering 5% or so of human-induced global warming[2] and its climate impact is still growing at a rate far greater 
than almost any other sector. 
In this context, a profusion of 'green flying' and 'sustainability' advertising campaigns has turned the industry into an 
emblematic example of the debate between growth and sustainability. 
Why greenwashing? 
The rise in greenwashing litigation can in part be attributed to the relative ease with which cases can be brought. It's 
simply a lot easier to attack an airline's advertising compared to other activities that might be targeted by strategic 
climate litigation. 
Consumers can use legal mechanisms such as commercial practice or consumer protection regulations, as 
happened in a recent greenwashing complaint to the European Commission[3] filed by consumer groups in 19 
countries against 17 airlines. 
It's an effective form of climate action due to the power exerted by advertising on public perception and social 
norms. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[4] (IPCC) has underscored the importance of 
reducing demand for flying in the first place, something significantly hindered by adverts that downplay its 
environmental impact. 
Exposed: carbon offsets linked to high forest loss still on sale[5] 
A report[6] by Greenpeace and think tank the New Weather Institute[7] claimed that in 2019 airline advertisements 
influenced 34 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent emissions worldwide. 
This litigation is also buoyed by the demonstrable falsehoods that riddle the sustainability strategies of these 
companies. The pillars upon which their net-zero strategies rest vary from the broadly ineffective[8] to the 
dangerously fraudulent[9] and facilitate growth in a sector in dire need of reduction. 
Why airlines are perfect targets for anti-greenwashing legal action
Airlines all rely on some form of carbon offsetting - planting trees, for instance, to 'offset' the carbon emitted by the 
planes - or sustainable aviation fuel or carbon capture and storage, in order to 'mitigate' their climate impacts. 
Common litigation strategies 
Thus far, there have been six climate change-related cases brought against major airlines (four in Europe, one in 
the US and one in Brazil). These cases are buttressed by numerous legal complaints taken through the European 
Commission or the UK and US advertising standards boards which have already successfully ordered Ryanair[10], 
Lufthansa[11] and Etihad[12] to pull ad campaigns. 
In each of these three cases, authorities found that terminology like 'protecting the future', 'sustainable aviation' or 
'low-emissions airline' amounted to wilful misleading of consumers and breached advertising regulations. 
A recent case taken by Dutch campaigners against airline giant KLM[13] is the most daring example yet. Climate 
action group FossielVrij[14](Fossil-free) argues that KLM's 'Fly Responsibly' campaign constitutes misleading 
advertising under EU consumer law. 
Following coup, Gabon climate officials face corruption allegations[15] 
The group asserts that flying responsibly is impossible at present, and that KLM seeks company growth and 
increased flight sales, when it should be reducing emissions by reducing the number of flights. KLM said[16] its 
'communications comply with the applicable legislation and regulations', but has dropped the Fly Responsibly 
campaign. 
Interestingly, this case builds upon a ruling of the Dutch Advertisement Code Commission[17] and indicates the 
'snowballing' trend inherent in anti-greenwashing litigation, wherein cases rely upon precedent set by previous 
authorities. With this borne in mind, the recent 19-country complaint by the European Consumer Organisation could 
provide the strongest foundation to date for future litigation. 
Delta Airlines is also facing a class action suit in the US[18], brought by a California resident who alleges that by 
marketing itself as a 'carbon-neutral' Delta has grossly misrepresented its environmental impact. This points to a 
growing understanding of the ineffectiveness of carbon offsetting[19], a net-zero tactic adopted by almost every 
major airline. 
A Delta spokesperson[20] said the case is 'without legal merit' as the airline has 'transitioned its focus away from 
carbon offsets' towards decarbonising its own activities. European companies should follow this case closely as 
American-style 'class action' litigation will soon be made possible in the EU[21]. 
Does this litigation have teeth? 
These cases might result in companies simply pulling their green campaign while maintaining their existing 
corporate framework and growth models. More promisingly, recent research[22] suggests that any climate-related 
case taken against a major emitting company will affect the firm's value (on average by 0.057% following the filing 
of a case, and by 1.5% following an unfavourable decision). 
In reality, these early cases are merely scratching the surface of what's possible. Once these cases enter the public 
conversation, a growing understanding of consumer protection is bound to follow. 
Green Climate Fund ambition at risk after 'disappointing' pledges[23] 
In many jurisdictions, such as my home country of Ireland, significant damages can be awarded against companies 
for misleading advertisement. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which is currently investigating claims 
of greenwashing in other sectors, will soon be able to fine companies 10% of their global turnover[24] for non-
compliance. 
While anti-greenwashing litigation might not halt the growth of this industry altogether, it is no doubt an invaluable 
tool. At its most effective, it can stop blatant profiteering from the climate crisis and force the aviation sector to 
confront the chimera that is green growth.

Oct 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Air Canada's ACDVF[1] pilots demonstrated at Toronto's Pearson Airport, demanding higher pay, 
job security and better working conditions. Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] featured in the news following 
its bearish guidance for the third quarter of 2023. 
Joby Aviation JOBY[3] took a step toward fulfilling its goal of commercial operations when it expanded the scope of 
its flight test program to include flying with a pilot onboard. European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] 
September traffic declined sequentially mainly due to air traffic control strikes Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. JetBlue's management announced that adverse weather and air traffic control issues in the 
Northeast hurt operations during the third quarter. Additionally, leisure travel bookings during the September quarter 
were lower than expected. For third-quarter 2023, JetBlue now anticipates revenues to be near the low end of its 
prior guidance (earlier estimate was a decline of 4-8%). 
Non-fuel unit cost for the September quarter is now expected to be near the high end of the prior view (the earlier 
estimate was a 2.5-5.5% increase). With oil prices moving north, JetBlue raised its fuel cost per gallon guidance for 
the third quarter and now anticipates[5] fuel price per gallon to be around $2.95 (prior view: $2.75-$2.90 band). 
JBLU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. Air Canada's pilots have received a 2% wage increase per year since 2014. The contract ended on Sep 29. The 
union believes that the ongoing talks, which have been going on since June 2023, will continue throughout October, 
leaving them without a contract. With no breakthrough yet, pilots of ACDVF are naturally pressing for a new pay-
related contract. The recent lucrative deals inked by its counterparts in the United States also acted as a catalyst[7] 
behind their decision to protest. 
Air Canada has also been in the news recently due to its fleet upgrade efforts. The news was covered in detail in 
the previous week's write-up[8]. 
3. In September, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights was 17.4 million, reflecting a 9% year-over-
year increase. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 94% in September 2023. The 
reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 97,350 flights in September 2023. 
Airline Stock Roundup: ACDVF 's Pilot Unrest, JBLU's Bleak Q3 Guidance & More
4. Most of Joby Aviation's testing has been completed remotely from a ground control station by using modern 
communications technology and software. This remote testing allowed JOBY to generate a large amount of data on 
the performance of the aircraft through a variety of flight conditions. The pilot-on-board campaign was led by its 
Chief Test Pilot, James Denham. The campaign was designed to collect information[9] on the aircraft's handling 
qualities and pilot control interfaces. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major 
airline players over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red in the past week. As a result, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index declined 3.2% over the period to $52.58. Over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker 
declined 6.9%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? 
Delta Air Lines DAL[10] is scheduled to kickstart the third-quarter earnings season for airlines on Oct 12. While 
passenger revenues are likely to have been impressive, high fuel costs are expected[11] to have dented DAL's 
bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

 It's a small airline with just eight aircraft and that is to remain the same, but a lot is about to change for Air Malta[1], 
the national carrier of the island of Malta in the Mediterranean. After many years of struggling and failed rescue 
attempts, the current airline will be dissolved on March 30, only to be succeeded the next day by a new airline that 
will likely continue to operate under the same Air Malta brand. 
The Maltese government announced the plans for the new national airline earlier this week. This follows two difficult 
years for Air Malta, in which it not only felt the effects of the pandemic but faced fierce competition from Ryanair 
subsidiary Malta Air and other low-cost airlines like Wizz Air and easyJet. Wizz Air[2] but also Lufthansa have 
established subsidiaries in Malta.

Teesside Airport is UK's 'most recovered' as passenger numbers take off
Teesside Airport is UK's 'most recovered' as passenger numbers take off

 A surge in holiday demand has helped award-winning Teesside International Airport enjoy the biggest recovery in 
passenger numbers of any UK airport. 
The airport has seen passenger numbers soar by 96 per cent since 2019. It is by far the biggest increase by a UK 
airport in a period which the industry suffered the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The official figures show major progress being made in the long-term turnaround plan and come as the airport 
celebrates being named UK and Irish Airport of the Year. 
Civil Aviation Authority data showed 25,369 passengers passed through the airport in July, compared with fewer 
than 13,000 in 2019. Teesside was one of just six of 35 UK airports to exceed its pre-pandemic figures and bucked 
the national trend which has seen a 6 per cent drop in overall air travel. 
Separately, the airport also enjoyed its best month since 2010 in September beating the previous record set only in 
June, as the total exceeded 27,000. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: 'These figures show that our turnaround plan is working by delivering the 
flights and services that people want from their local airport. We have worked incredibly hard to recover from the 
impact of the pandemic and it's fantastic that we've achieved by far the biggest bounce-back of any airport in the 
country. 
'This is only the start. We want more great destinations to make sure we grow these numbers. This growth - 
alongside our development as a great location for businesses - will help us deliver on our plan to return the airport 
to profit.' 
The rise in passenger numbers has been fuelled by an enhanced package of holiday flights, with thousands of 
families jetting off to the sun. This summer has seen the airport enjoy its busiest period since returning to public 
ownership in 2019 and is on course to record its busiest year since 2011. 
Holiday hotspots with airline Ryanair to Alicante, Faro in Portugal, Majorca, and Corfu have proved popular. TUI 
has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity 
of the route last year and a service to Antalya, Turkey. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are using KLM's three-times daily 
service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Teesside Airport is UK's 'most recovered' as passenger numbers take off
Phil Forster, Teesside International airport managing director, said: 'These figures confirm how Teesside is moving 
firmly in the right direction. We are confident that we can now build on this success by adding more flights so 
passengers will make Teesside their first choice thanks to the fantastic experience of flying from our airport.' 
Teesside was named UK and Irish Airport of the Year at the TTG Travel Industry Awards in London after winning 
recognition for its growth in flights and delivering a great passenger experience. 
It is also in the running for the British Travel Awards for Best UK Airport, and is the only national airport going up 
against global competition in the International Airport Review's Airport Experience Award. Major progress has been 
made in developing the airport as a key location for businesses as part of the ten-year plan to return to profit. 
Work is now almost complete on the link road and first unit on the 200m Business Park South on the airport's 
southside, which is set to create 4,400 jobs when fully operational while new hangars are also being developed on 
the northside of the airport.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported solid traffic numbers for September, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 17.4 million, implying that 9% more passengers 
flew than a year ago. 
Although RYAAY's traffic has shown year-over-year growth, it has declined sequentially, mainly due to air traffic 
control strikes. The September figure compares unfavorably with the August 2023 figure of 18.9 million and the July 
figure of 18.7 million. The figure came in line with the June 2023 figure of 17.4 million. 
The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 94% in September 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 97,350 flights in September 2023. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 29.2% so far this year compared with 0.6% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry.

Ryanair expects its traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. In spite of upbeat passenger volumes, RYAAY 
continues to be hurt due to headwinds like air traffic control strikes and further probable Boeing delivery delays. 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are GATX Corporation (GATX), Westinghouse 
Air Brake Technologies Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation (WAB) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW). Each of 
these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[4]. 
GATX has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.33% for the current year. GATX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 17.30%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX's current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the past 90 days. 
Shares of GATX have gained 1.3% year to date. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 16.87% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 3.42%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 5.5% year to date. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) September Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable.A fall in operating expenses is a tailwind for SkyWest. In 
second-quarter 2023, the metric dipped 2.4% to $693.8 million due to a decline in operating costs. Low operating 
expenses boost bottom-line results. Shares of SKYW have surged 149.8% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31.51%, on average. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's credited with a 'watershed medical breakthrough' and is developing a bustling pipeline of other projects that 
could make a world of difference for patients suffering from diseases involving the liver, lungs, and blood. This is a 
timely investment that you can catch while it emerges from its bear market lows. 
 It could rival or surpass other recent Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in 
little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top Stock And 4

Sep 29, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and 
were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose 
securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. 
With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better 
chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what 
value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, 
Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, 
and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into 
account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of 
upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly 
Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Top Growth Stock for the Long-Term
percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine 
favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks. 
VGM Score 
What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it 
one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined 
weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and 
most promising momentum. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier. 
#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more 
than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of 
stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, 
on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to 
pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 
(Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RYAAY has a Growth Style Score of A, 
forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 23.3% for the current fiscal year. 
For fiscal 2024, one analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.26 to $8.99 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

 It's game on for another round of airline consolidation in Europe. The PortugueseCouncil of Ministers[1] has 
approved the plan to privatize TAP Air Portugal[2] and sell 51 percent. At least five percent will be reserved for the 
airline's employees, the government announced on Thursday. The state currently is the sole shareholder. 
During a press conference, Minister of Finance Fernando Medina said that the privatization has five targets. The 
first is to ensure that TAP Air Portugal can continue to grow under a new minority owner. The second is that Lisbon 
can be developed and grow as the main hub beyond the 53 percent market share it has there now. TAP should also 
grow end-to-end operations and operate to what Media referred to as untapped capacity at domestic airports. The 
priority is Porto, where low-cost carriers like easyJet and Ryanair have gained market share.

 Delivery delays of the Boeing MAX 8200 forceRyanair[1] to make adjustments in its original winter 2023/2024 
schedule. The low-cost carrier said on Thursday that it is expecting thirteen fewer aircraft deliveries until the end of 
December.  
Ryanair had expected 27 MAX 8200s between September and the end of December but is now anticipating only 
fourteen between October and December. The carrier cites production delays at Boeing's supplierSpirit 
AeroSystems[2] as one of the reasons. Spirit is down on its production target after employees went on strike in July 
and are unable to recover from this.

 For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common 
goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. 
The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and 
so on. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what 
value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, 
Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, 
and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into 
account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings 
outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint 
Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Value Stock
good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage 
change in earnings estimates. 
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or 
changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are 
right for you and your investing journey. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also 
have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
It also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 10.74; value 
investors should take notice. 
One analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.31 to $9.04 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

 The Zacks Airline[1]industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-19 
travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand 
for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger 
revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Notably, the Zacks Airline[1]industry has risen 6.4% so far this year, outperforming 5.9% growth of the broader 
Zacks Transportation[2]sector.

 H2Fly, acquired by Joby Aviation JOBY[1] in 2021, created a buzz in the aviation space by achieving a milestone 
that no other company has accomplished so far. H2Fly announced that it has completed a series of liquid hydrogen-
powered piloted flights of its four-seater HY4 demonstrator. 
One of the flights lasted for more than three hours. Previously, H2Fly had completed flights powered by pressurized 
gaseous hydrogen. 
The successful completion of these flights demonstrates the utility of employing cryogenically-stored liquid 
hydrogen instead of gaseous hydrogen. The usage leads to significantly lower tank weights and volume, which, in 
turn, leads to longer range. 
The success of flights with liquid hydrogen is expected to increase the range of H2FLY's HY4 demonstrator aircraft 
from 750 km to 1500 km. This is in-line with the achievement of the long-term goal of decarbonization of mid-to-long 
range aviation. 
The achievement of this milestone implies the ending of Project HEAVEN, a European government-backed 
consortium led by H2FLY, on a happy note. The consortium was created to explore the use of cryogenic liquid 
hydrogen in planes. Following this achievement, JOBY's wholly-owned subsidiary will now shift its focus on the path 
to commercialization. 
Expressing delight on this accomplishment Joby Aviation's founder and CEO, JoeBen Bevirt, said, 'H2FLY are 
pioneers in their field, and we're proud of them achieving this watershed moment in the use of liquid hydrogen to 
power aircraft." Zacks Rank & Key Picks Joby Aviation currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation [2]sector may consider stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] and 
Air Transport Services Group ATSG[4]. Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
Ryanair Holdings' growth prospects are being supported by an upbeat in air-travel-demand scenario. An uptick in 
passenger volumes is leading the company to post impressive traffic numbers over the past few months. 
Measures for expanding its fleet to cater to the rising travel demand are encouraging as well. Riding on the buoyant 
air-traffic scenario, RYAAY shares have gained 28.5% year to date. RYAAY surpassed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by 21.4%, on average. 
JOBY 's Unit Completes Liquid H2-Powered Piloted Flights
An uptrend with respect to e-commerce, even in the post-pandemic scenario, is a huge positive for Air Transport 
Services. It is the primary driver behind an uptick in demand for midsize air freighters. 
Driven by the upbeat demand, ATSG delivered a record six converted freighters under lease in a month to its 
customers worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ATSG's current-year earnings has been revised 11.2% 
upward over the past 60 days. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's credited with a 'watershed medical breakthrough' and is developing a bustling pipeline of other projects that 
could make a world of difference for patients suffering from diseases involving the liver, lungs, and blood. This is a 
timely investment that you can catch while it emerges from its bear market lows. 
 It could rival or surpass other recent Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in 
little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top Stock And 4

Sep 08, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL) recently reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and 
capacity for August 2023. 
In August, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a 
measure of capacity) increased 11.6% and 7.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With traffic growth 
outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for August 2023 improved 
to 84.4% from 81.5% in August 2022. The number of flight departures at GOL in August registered a 17.8% year-
over-year increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 22.4% year over year. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (13.7%) outpacing available seat kilometers (9.4%), the 
load factor increased to 84.6% from 81.4% in August 2022. 
Internationally, the load factor increased to 82.7% from 82.3% in August 2022. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 18.1% on a year-
over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 21.8% in August. International departures 
increased 11.7% in August on a year-over-year basis. The number of seats rose 17.4% internationally. 
On the domestic front, passengers on board rose 22.7% year over year. Internationally, the metric increased 13% 
year over year. 
Given the buoyant traffic scenario, Gol Linhas is not the only airline to report impressive traffic numbers for August. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], a European carrier, also reported impressive traffic numbers for August 2023, driven 
by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August was 18.9 million, 
implying an increase of 12% from a year ago. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor was as high as 96% in August. 
The reading was similar in the year-ago period. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Gol Linhas currently carries a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[2] sector are GATX Corporation (GATX) and SkyWest, 
Inc. (SKYW). Each of these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
GATX has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.33% for the current year. GATX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 17.30%, on average. 
Gol Linhas (GOL) August Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX's current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the past 90 days.

Sep 08, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, management of airline heavyweights --- United Airlines UAL[1], Alaska Air Group ALK[2] and 
Southwest Airlines LUV[3] increased their respective projections for third-quarter 2023 fuel price per gallon. 
Hawaiian Holdings HA[4], meanwhile, revised its projections downward for key metrics for third-quarter as well as 
full-year 2023. 
The devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui resulted in dull projections. Also, issues with 
RTX's Pratt & Whitney engines that power Airbus' popular A320neo jets added to the woes. We note that HA's fleet 
includes A320neo jets with engines, which need to be inspected following problems identified by Pratt & Whitney. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5], grabbed headlines by virtue of its stellar traffic numbers for the 
month of August. 
Read the Last Airline Roundup here[6] Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. United Airlines' 
management stated that 'since mid-July 2023, jet fuel prices have climbed over 20%'. United Airlinesnow expects 
the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range). Southwest 
Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.7-$2.8 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 
range). Operating revenue per available seat milefor the third quarter of 2023 is now expected to decline in the 5-
7% band from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 3-7% decline). 
Alaska Air now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $3.15-$3.25 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.7-$2.8 
range). Due to high costs, the third-quarter adjusted pre-tax margin is now expected in the 10-12% range (earlier 
guidance was 14-16%). Total revenues are now expected to increase in the 1-2% range from third-quarter 2022 
actuals (the earlier projection was for a 0-3% increase). Non-fuel unit costs are now expected to be down 1-2% 
(earlier guidance: down 0-2%). Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are now expected to be up 
approximately 13% in third-quarter 2023 from the third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier guidance: up 10-13%) 
2. Ryanair, currently sporting a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the 
month of August, driven by upbeat air travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in 
August was 18.9 million, implying that 12% more passengers flew than a year ago. This was an all-time monthly 
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL , ALK & LUV 's Q3 Fuel Cost Warning, HA's Dull View
high traffic number. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high 
as 96%[7] in August. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. 
3. For the third quarter of 2023, available seat miles or ASM are now projected by HA to increase 4-5.5% from third-
quarter 2022 levels (earlier guidance: 4.5-7.5% rise). Total revenues per available seat miles are now anticipated to 
decrease 4-7% from third-quarter 2022 levels (prior projection: 2-5% decline). Fuel price per gallon is now expected 
at $2.91 in third-quarter 2023 (the earlier view was $2.67). The effective tax rate is still anticipated to be 21% in the 
third quarter. ASMs are now projected[9] to climb in the 8-10% band for full-year 2023 (earlier guidance: 8.5-10.5% 
jump). Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red in the past week. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 5% over the period to $58.66. Over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker has 
decreased 7.7%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

Sep 07, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
Zacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and 
were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose 
securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. 
Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the 
better chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what 
value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, 
Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking 
advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week 
Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Top Value Stock for the Long-Term
price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate 
favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks. 
VGM Score 
If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, 
and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared 
weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most 
promising momentum. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier. 
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% 
average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large 
number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, 
on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a 
declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B. 
It also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 10.75; value 
investors should take notice. 
Four analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $1.51 to $9.04 per share. RYAAY also boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list. 
 Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock  
 It's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is 
still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom. 
 With strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for 
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to 
explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028. See This Stock Now for Free  > >[1] Want the latest

These Were Archegos Capital Founder Bill Hwang's Favorite Hedge Funds

 Most hedge fund managers rake in millions of dollars every year, and many give back by donating large sums of 
money to charity on a regular basis, including through their own foundations. Archegos Capital founder Bill Hwang, 
who founded Tiger Asia Management and managed it until it was shut down in 2012, is one of those who uses their 
own foundation to dole out their fortunes. 
His legal problems and upcoming trial on fraud charges notwithstanding, we can get an idea about Hwang's favorite 
fund managers by reviewing his foundation's annual filing. According to the 990 for its 2021 fiscal year[1], which 
was filed in November 2022, The Grace and Mercy Foundation had $662 million in assets at the end of the year. 
Q2 2023 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] 
Capital Gains And Losses 
Of course, Hwang is a Tiger cub, meaning he learned the finer points of hedge fund management at Julian 
Robertson's Tiger Management. His foundation recorded capital gains and losses on several funds in fiscal 2021, 
including funds operated by several other Tiger cubs: 
Tiger Veda Global - Founded by fellow Tiger cub Manish Chopra, Tiger Veda announced plans to shut down in 
2015, citing the "needle-in-a-haystack process" that was making it difficult to find a new "value" long investment. 
Given that this fund planned to return all of its investor capital by early 2016, it's unclear why The Grace and Mercy 
Foundation listed its holdings in the fund as being sold in April 2021. Tiger Global - Founded by fellow Tiger cub 
Chase Coleman III, Tiger Global now stands in the midst of a major controversy over an alleged memo that the firm 
said came from a disgruntled former employee bent on spreading misinformation[3]. Aside from that bit of recent 
news, Tiger Global fell on hard times during the most recent crash in tech stocks, although it remains open, unlike 
many other Tiger-cub funds. Teng Yue Partners - This China-focused fund was founded by Tao Li in 2011 and 
focuses on public and private equity investments using fundamental analysis with a global perspective and local 
expertise. Teng Yue also targets companies outside China "where core research informs the investment ideas." 
Woodson Capital Partners - Woodson Capital Management is a Tiger seed fund, meaning Robertson's Tiger 
Management gave the firm some starting-out funds to get things going. Woodson generated triple-digit gains on its 
big bet on pandemic-era winner Peloton Interactive and then turned to homebuilding stocks in 2022. Currently, the 
firm's top holdings include Ryanair Holdings, Deckers Outdoor, Mister Car Wash, Suncor Energy and Callaway 
These Were Archegos Capital Founder Bill Hwang's Favorite Hedge Funds
Golf. Falcon Edge Global - Founded in 2012 by Rick Gerson, Ryan Khoury and Navroz Udwadia, Falcon Edge 
rebranded to Alpha Wave Global in late 2021. The Tiger "grandcub" firm invests across asset classes and counts 
some well-known names among its portfolio companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX and The Boring Company, 
Alibaba and its fintech arm, Ant Group, and Asian ridesharing firm DiDi and its competitor Lyft. Alpha Wave's top 
holdings during the second quarter included PNM Resources, which accounted for over 20% of its portfolio, Amylyx 
Pharmaceuticals, BWX Technologies, NextGen Energy, and Mister Car Wash. Miura Global Partners - Founded by 
Francisco Alfaro and Richard Turnure in 2004, Miura Global is a Tiger seed fund that utilizes a long/ short equity 
strategy with a global focus. As of the second quarter, the firm's top holdings included put options in the Invesco 
QQQ Trust, which accounted for over 38% of its portfolio, Microsoft, Boston Scientific, Inmode and Arthur J. 
Gallagher. Totem Point Offshore Fund - Totem Point Management, another Tiger cub, launched its long/ short 
equity fund in 2013, followed by its long-only fund in 2018 and private investments in 2021. As of the second 
quarter, the firm's top holdings included Analog Devices, S&P Global, NVIDIA, MSCI and ON Semiconductor. Tiger

Coleman's Tiger Global that invests in the U.S., China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India. Further Global Capital 
Partners A - Further Global Capital Management invests in the financial services industry providing "creative, 
bespoke solutions" within its target universe. The firm targets equity investments of $75 million to $200 million, 
although it can execute significantly larger co-investment transactions. Further Global usually seeks controlling 
interests, although it is also comfortable operating as a minority owner in certain situations. Ascend Capital Partners 
Co-Invest (Blocker) - This firm describes itself as "business starters and operators who have worked across Eastern 
and Western cultures." Ascend Capital seeks early-stage disruptive tech companies with commercial potential in 
the U.S., Europe and China, especially those that complement its existing portfolio to create "holistic solutions." The 
firm especially focuses on the medtech and mobility industries.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the month of August, driven by upbeat 
air travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August was 18.9 million, implying that 
12% more passengers flew than a year ago. 
Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 96% in August. 
This, however, remained flat from its year-ago figure. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 34.7% over the past year compared with the 
12.1% growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair has been benefiting from a stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows. 
While passenger volumes continue to be strong, what is all the more encouraging is the strong bounce back of 
international travel. 
Ryanair expects its traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. In spite of upbeat passenger volumes, RYAAY 
continues to be hurt due to headwinds like air traffic control strikes and further probable Boeing delivery delays. Due 
to the challenges, management trimmed its fiscal 2024 traffic forecast from 185 million. Zacks Rank & Key Picks 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are GATX Corporation 
GATX[4] and Triton International Limited TRTN[5]. 
GATX, which presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has strengthened its railcar leasing operations. You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
For third-quarter and full-year 2023, GATX's earnings are expected to register 36.6% and 14.3% growth, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. 
Triton, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, is benefiting from its consistent efforts to reward shareholders 
through dividends and share repurchases. 
Triton has an impressive liquidity position. Its current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 3.83 at the end of second-
quarter 2023. A current ratio of more than 1 often indicates that the company will be easily paying off its short-term 
obligations.

Aug 30, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - August 30, 2023 - Stocks in this week's article are Medpace Holdings, Inc. 
MEDP[1], Invitation Home Inc. INVH[2] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3]. 3 Top Stocks Exhibiting Superb 
Earnings Growth Earnings growth is the main priority for any organization. This is because if the company doesn't 
make money, it won't last sooner or later. 
So, what's earnings growth? Study a company's revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and 
you have earnings. Incidentally, this is also considered the most important variable manipulating the share price. 
But, expectations of earnings play a significant role. Earnings Estimates & Share Price Movements Frequently, we 
have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. 
This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations. 
Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive 
industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while 
making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair 
value of a firm. 
Thus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks 
with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. 
The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only six. Here are the top three stocks 
that stand out: 
Medpace Holdings, Inc. is a scientifically driven, global, full-service clinical contract research organization. Medpace 
has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MEDP's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 15.3%. You can 
see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[4]. 
Invitation Home Inc. provides real estate services. It focuses on owning, renovating, leasing and operating single-
family residential properties. Invitation Home has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). INVH's expected earnings growth rate for 
the current year is 7.2%. 
Ryanair Holdings plc provides scheduled passenger airline services. Ryanair has a Zacks Rank #1. RYAAY's 
expected earnings growth rate for the current year is almost 25%.

 An air traffic control glitch that left thousands of passengers stranded has caused knock-on effects that are set to 
last for days. The government on Tuesday vowed to investigate the "rare" incident.The British government has 
ordered a review into the country's air traffic control system on Tuesday after a glitch stranded thousands of 
passengers and caused delays that are set to last for days. 
More than 1,500 flights were cancelled on Monday, which was a public holiday and one of the year's busiest travel 
dates as school holidays draw to a close. 
Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the incident was the worst of its kind for "nearly a decade" and ordered an 
independent review. 
"This was a technical fault," he told GB News. "We do not think this was a cybersecurity incident." 
Delays for days 
Although the system was brought back online within hours, the United Kingdom's National Air Traffic Services said 
the backlog of flights would last for "several days." 
That's because airline schedules have been disrupted, and many flight crews are still out of place. 
"I know people will be enormously frustrated by the disruption that's impacting them," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 
said in a broadcast statement. 
"Thankfully things like this are rare and the issue itself was fixed in a matter of hours, but the disruption obviously is 
continuing and will last for a little while longer." 
Airlines battle travel chaos 
British Airways was the worst-affected airline. 
It said it was working "to get back on track" and offered short-haul passengers the option to change their flight dates 
for free. 
Meanwhile, budget carrier Ryanair said on Tuesday that it expected "considerable flight delays" plus some further 
flight cancellations. 
The UK's busiest airport, London Heathrow, told passengers to contact their airline before travelling to the airport on 
Tuesday.

 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. 
Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the 
better chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a 
stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value 
Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, 
and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into 
account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking 
advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week 
Here's Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Strong Growth Stock
price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate 
favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks. 
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or 
changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are 
right for you and your investing journey. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate 
revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RYAAY has a Growth Style Score of A, 
forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 25% for the current fiscal year. 
Four analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $1.58 to $9.11 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

 For those looking to find strong Transportation stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are 
outperforming their peers. Ryanair (RYAAY) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but 
do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date 
performance in comparison to the rest of the Transportation sector should help us answer this question. 
Ryanair is a member of our Transportation group, which includes 131 different companies and currently sits at #13 
in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to 
worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a 
variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. 
Ryanair is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's full-year earnings has moved 23.3% higher within the past quarter. 
This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend. 
According to our latest data, RYAAY has moved about 33.2% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, stocks in the 
Transportation group have gained about 8.6% on average. This shows that Ryanair is outperforming its peers so far 
this year. 
United Airlines (UAL) is another Transportation stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year. Since the 
beginning of the year, the stock has returned 31.7%. 
The consensus estimate for United Airlines' current year EPS has increased 21% over the past three months. The 
stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
Looking more specifically, Ryanair belongs to the Transportation - Airline industry, a group that includes 30 
individual stocks and currently sits at #73 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 13.5% 
so far this year, so RYAAY is performing better in this area. United Airlines is also part of the same industry. 
Going forward, investors interested in Transportation stocks should continue to pay close attention to Ryanair and 
United Airlines as they could maintain their solid performance.

Aug 18, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - August 18, 2023 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Southwest Airlines LUV[1], Copa Holdings' 
CPA[2], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Delta Air Lines DAL[4] and American Airlines AAL[5]. 
Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup: Labor Deals, Traffic Reports & More In 
the past week, Southwest Airlines received encouraging news on the labor front when it reached a provisional 
agreement with the union that represents more than 17,000 of its ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo 
employees. 
Meanwhile, Copa Holdings' traffic report for July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air travel 
demand. Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes, European carrier Ryanair Holdings anticipates carrying a 
higher number of passengers in the current month than in July. If the expectation materializes, RYAAY would 
establish a new monthly traffic record. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. The provisional deal 
inked between LUV's management and the Transport Workers Union Local 555 or TWU 555 provides substantial 
wage increase, better retirement and other benefits to the concerned employees. The deal will materialize only if it 
is approved through the ratification voting process. The details of LUV's current agreement and voting timeline will 
be directly communicated to Southwest Airlines' members by TWU 555. 
2. In July, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits, i.e., 12.5% on a year-over-year 
basis at CPA. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In July, available seat miles (a measure 
of capacity) increased 9.9% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 89% from 87% in July 2022. 
Copa Holdings was also in the news when it reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for 
second-quarter 2023. The news was covered in the previous week's write up[6]. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Southwest Airlines , Copa Holdings , Ryanair Holdings , Delta Air Lines and 
American Airlines
3. According to aReuters report[7], Irish carrierRyanair Holdingsexpects to carry more passengers in August than 
the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, which itself is a 
record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%. 
Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, "It should be slightly more (than July) ... 
people are still travelling." Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. Ryanair has been 
benefiting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows. 
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[8]. 
4. In a bid to meet the strong recovery in international travel in the post-pandemic scenario, Delta Air Lines has 
decided to expand its flight schedule to China. To this end, this Atlanta-based carrier has decided to operate 10 
weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its hubs in Seattle and Detroit hubs this winter. 
From Oct 29, the airline will operate daily flights from Shanghai and three-times-a-week flights from Detroit. 
Moreover, Delta intends to resume four-times-weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from Los 
Angeles. DAL has not operated on the route since early 2020. 
According to a Reuters report[9], American Airlines has also decided to expand its China operations. The carrier 
has decided to commence daily flights from Dallas-Fort Worth to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from 
January 2024. Price Performance All airline stocks traded in the red in the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 5.9% over the period to $63.51. Over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker has 
increased 3.8%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

Aug 17, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Southwest Airlines LUV[1] received encouraging news on the labor front when it reached a 
provisional agreement with the union that represents more than 17,000 of its ramp, operations, provisioning and 
cargo employees. 
Meanwhile, Copa Holdings' CPA[2] traffic report for July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air 
travel demand. Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] anticipates 
carrying a higher number of passengers in the current month than in July. If the expectation materializes, RYAAY 
would establish a new monthly traffic record. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. The provisional 
deal inked between LUV's management and the Transport Workers Union Local 555 or TWU 555 provides 
substantial wage increase, better retirement and other benefits to the concerned employees. The deal will 
materialize only if it is approved through the ratification voting process. The details of LUV's current agreement and 
voting timeline will be directly communicated to Southwest Airlines' members by TWU 555. 
2. In July, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits, i.e., 12.5% on a year-over-year 
basis at CPA. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In July, available seat miles (a measure 
of capacity) increased 9.9% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 89% from 87% in July 2022. 
Copa Holdings was also in the news when it reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for 
second-quarter 2023. The news was covered in the previous week's write up[4]. 
3. According to aReuters report[5], Irish carrierRyanair Holdingsexpects to carry more passengers in August than 
the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, which itself is a 
record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%. 
Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, "It should be slightly more (than July) ... 
people are still travelling." Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. Ryanair has been 
benefiting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows. 
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6].

4. In a bid to meet the strong recovery in international travel in the post-pandemic scenario, Delta Air Lines DAL[7] 
has decided to expand its flight schedule to China. To this end, this Atlanta-based carrier has decided to operate 10 
weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its hubs in Seattle and Detroit hubs this winter. 
From Oct 29, the airline will operate daily flights from Shanghai and three-times-a-week flights from Detroit. 
Moreover, Delta intends to resume four-times-weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from Los 
Angeles. DAL has not operated on the route since early 2020. 
According to a Reuters report[8], American Airlines AAL[9] has also decided to expand its China operations. The 
carrier has decided to commence daily flights from Dallas-Fort Worth to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from 
January 2024.

 Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) is benefiting from the improvement in traffic from the pandemic-led slump. 
Measures to expand its fleet and bring down debt levels are encouraging too. 
Against this backdrop, let's look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick. What Makes RYAAY an 
Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an 
impressive run on the bourse year to date. Shares of RYAAY have gained 31.4% so far this year compared with the 
16.5% rise of the industry[1]it belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Solid Rank & VGM Score: RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score[2]of A. Our research shows 
that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best 
investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment proposition at the moment. 
Northward Estimate Revisions:The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to 
the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's second-quarter fiscal 2024 
earnings has moved up 28.72% year over year. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: RYAAY has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an 
earnings surprise of 17.16% in the last four quarters, on average. 
Earnings Expectations: Earnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company's prospects. For second-
quarter fiscal 2024, RYAAY's earnings are expected to grow 39.85% year over year. 
Growth Factors:An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. The number of 
passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in July was 18.7 million, up 11% year over year. This compared favorably with 
the June 2023 figure of 17.4 million and the May 2023 figure of 17 million. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor 
was high at 96% in July 2023. The reading was similar to that reported a year ago. RYAAY operated more than 
102,000 flights in July 2023. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €663 million in first-quarter fiscal 2024, up 
more than 100% year over year. Average fares in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were up 42%. Ryanair expects its 
traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. Other Stocks to Consider Investors interested in the Zacks Airline[1] 
industry may also consider some top-ranked stocks likeUnited AirlinesUAL[3] andDelta Air LinesDAL[4]. UAL 
6 Reasons Why Ryanair (RYAAY) Should be in Your Portfolio
presently sports a Zacks Rank #1, while DAL carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
United Airlines is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to this, UAL 
expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our third-quarter total revenue 
estimate hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year. 
For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL's current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days. 
Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Due to the positive, DAL reported 
better-than-expected earnings per share (EPS) and revenues in the second quarter of 2023. For third-quarter 2023, 
the company expects EPS in the range of $2.2-$2.5. 
Management also raised its EPS outlook for the current year. The company now anticipates 2023 EPS (on an 
adjusted basis) in the band of $6-$7 (previous view: $6 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL's 
current-year earnings has been revised 23.5% upward over the past 60 days.

Aug 15, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 According to a Reuters report[1], Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] expects to carry more passengers in 
August than the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, 
which itself is a record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%. 
Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, "It should be slightly more (than July) ... 
people are still travelling". Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. 
Ryanair has been benefitting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic 
lows. While passenger volumes continue to be strong, what is all the more encouraging is the strong bounce back 
of international travel. 
Ryanair expects its traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. In spite of upbeat passenger volumes, RYAAY 
continues to be hurt due to headwinds like air traffic control strikes and potential further Boeing delivery delays. Due 
to the challenges, management trimmed its fiscal 2024 traffic forecast to 183.5 million from 185 million. Zacks Rank 
& Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors interested in the Zacks Airline[3] 
industry may also consider stocks likeUnited AirlinesUAL[4] andDelta Air LinesDAL[5].While UAL sports a Zacks 
Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DAL carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank stocks here[6]. 
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to this, UAL 
expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our third-quarter total revenue 
estimate hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year. 
For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL's current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days. 
Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Due to the positive, DAL reported 
better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in second-quarter 2023. Third-quarter earnings are forecast 
in the range of $2.2-$2. 5 per share. 
Management raised its earnings per share outlook for the current year. The company now estimates 2023 earnings 
(on an adjusted basis) in the band of $6-$7 per share (previous view: $6 per share). The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for DAL's current-year earnings has been revised 23.5% upward over the past 60 days.

 Teesside Airport has seen its busiest month in more than a decade. June saw a total of 25,666 passengers pass 
through the terminal, the highest figure since September 2010. 
July was also a bumper month, with 24,781 people choosing Teesside. An enhanced package of holiday flights has 
bolstered the airport's summer programme. 
Hundreds of families have jetted off for some 'much-needed sun' with the airport enjoying its busiest day since 
returning to public ownership in late July. It means Teesside is on course to record its highest annual passenger 
numbers since 2011. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'These figures show we are well and truly heading in the right 
direction when it comes to making our airport a success. But we know there is still a very long way to go. Breaching 
the 25,000 figure is good, but we have ambitions to be hitting that every single week. 
'The people of Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool have supported us - and we couldn't have achieved what we 
have without them. Our airport is a sleeping giant awaking from its slumber. We know what people are crying out 
for, and we will continue to strain every sinew to attract new holiday flights and routes. 
'Our new business park, freight facility and Freeport status will all have their roles to play in returning our airport to 
profit. The ten-year plan is working and we've an exciting future ahead.' 
Holiday hotspots with airline Ryanair to Alicante, Faro in Portugal, Majorca, and Corfu have proved popular. TUI 
has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity 
of the route last year and a service to Antalya, Turkey. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are using KLM's three-times daily 
service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Phil Forster, Teesside Airport managing director, added: 'These figures are a big boost and it's been a real pleasure 
to hear the great feedback from passengers about their experiences. We're really making Teesside an airport to be 
proud of. 
Teesside International Airport celebrates busiest month in 'more than a decade'
'Our staff are second to none, and I'd like to thank them for all their hard work in helping us hit this new high. I've 
heard so many positive things about how our teams have offered a great service, even when passenger numbers 
and demand have risen quickly.'

 Boeing's[1] aim to stabilize 737/MAX production and deliveries (and that of other models) hasn't quite worked out in 
July. At 43 deliveries, the number was lower than that of June, when the airframer dispatched 60 aircraft to lessors 
and airlines. Boeing deliveries are still far from stable. 
The focus is mainly of the two models that have been plagued by recent delivery delays: the 737/MAX and the 787. 
July saw one 737 P-8A and 32 MAX deliveries, with United Airlines taking nine, Southwest seven, and Ryanair four 
aircraft for the majority of deliveries. India's Akasa Air became the second airline after Ryanair to take a (leased) 
MAX 8200 (main picture). 
The July number compares to one P-8A and 48 MAX in June, one P-8A and 35 MAX in May, and one P-8A and 
seventeen MAX in April. April and May's deliveries were impacted by rework required on correcting tailfin fittings on 
aircraft in inventory and production. For March, February, and January, the delivery split between 737 P-8s and 
MAX was 1/52, 1/24, and 35 (MAX only). 
The numbers confirm that deliveries are well off the stable pattern of on average 35 per month that Boeing hoped to 
achieve by now before accelerating to a production rate of 38 per month. But as Chief Financial Officer Brian West 
said during theQ2/HY1 earnings call[2] on July 26: 'It will take some months before we will see a stable 38 aircraft 
coming off the line.' 
Fuselage supplierSpirit AeroSystems[3] said last week that it is producing 38 frames a month this August and will 
remain at this level until early 2024. This might include delivering frames from its Wichita inventory as the company 
is trying to catch up from the effects of the eleven-day strike in June/July over a new labor contract. Spirit said full-
year deliveries to Boeing will fall behind by a margin of -20 to -50 frames compared to the planned schedule of 
between 370-390 in total. 
Dreamliner 
Dreamliner deliveries were also much lower than in previous months and stood at just four in July compared to six 
in June, eight in May, six in April, seven in March, three in February, and three in January. So there is no stability 
either here yet, with Boeing still having joint verification rework to do on multiple areas of the aircraft on in inventory. 
There were 85 of them by the end of June, so this must have come down to 81 by the end of July. 
Boeing deliveries are still far from stable
The 767-300F/KC-46 and 777F saw three deliveries of each family member in July compared to 4/1 in June, 3/3 in 
May, 1/1 in April, 1/3 in March, and 0/0 in February and January. 
Through July, Boeing has delivered 309 aircraft, of which 249 737/MAX. The full-year target is 400-450 737/MAX 
and 70-80 Dreamliners. 
Orders 
Boeing reported 52 gross orders for July, including a confirmation of the previously announced Dreamliner order 
from Saudia. The carrier ordered eighteen 787-9s and 21 -10s. There were twelve MAX orders, four from Luxair 
and eight from undisclosed customers. July saw no cancelations. 
Forty aircraft previously listed under ASC606 Adjustments as deliveries were uncertain have moved to the 
confirmed backlog, including 42 MAX. Two Dreamliners entered ASC606. Year to date, Boeing has won 659 net 
orders, of which 467 are new and 192 re-entered the backlog from ASC606. The total backlog stands at 4.928 
aircraft.

 As reported by Mint[1], as part of its strategy to rival tech giants Microsoft and Google, E-commerce giant Amazon 
has been conducting tests of its artificial intelligence services on thousands of customers. In addition, Amazon has 
recently unveiled a new AI tool designed for building conversational customer service agents and healthcare 
technology, specifically for generating notes after patient visits. Also, Amazon teamed upwith Meta and Microsoft[2] 
to challenge Google and Apple's map dominance. 
The company is making a significant push into the healthcare industry with the launch of AWS Healthscribe, a 
service aimed at developing apps that can transcribe and analyze conversations between doctors and patients. 
According to a report from Reuters, one major customer, a 3M unit, plans to utilize this technology for clinical 
documentation. 
Amazon's Bedrock service, introduced in April, targets its cloud customers and enables them to create apps using 
various AI models. This move is in response to the investment made by competitors like Microsoft and Google in 
generative AI technology. Microsoft has its AI chatbot, Bing Chat, and it is a major investor in OpenAI, known for its 
viral sensation, ChatGPT. Conversely, Google has its own generative AI-based chatbot called Bard, with plans to 
integrate it into different levels of its services. 
To leverage its status as the leading cloud provider in revenue, Amazon seeks to offer businesses a wider selection 
of AI models compared to its rivals. The company plans to make Amazon Bedrock available to all customers soon, 
although no specific date has been provided. 
Amazon's vice president of databases, machine learning, and analytics mentioned that several companies, 
including Sony, Ryanair, and Sun Life, have already tested the Amazon Bedrock service. Additionally, Amazon is 
working closely with Nvidia to secure key chips and understand their ramp-up schedule amid the fierce competition 
among AI companies.

CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran
CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran

Jul 27, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Aftermarket sales of spare parts for CFM LEAP and CFM56 engines have recovered to well over 2019 levels, the 
first time this happened since the pandemic. Sales were up 36.5 percent in HY1. As this trend is expected to 
continue this year,Safran Group[1] has raised its full-year guidance and now expects a €3.1 billion operating profit, 
up from €3.0 billion in the February guidance. CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran. 
Civil aftermarket revenues are guided to increase by mid to high-twenties in dollars compared to the low twenties in 
the previous guidance, Safran CEO Olivier Andris said on Thursday during the HY1 results earnings call. 
Aftermarket sales were already up 38.1 percent year on year in Q1 and again by 35 percent in Q2. This reflects 
higher part prices since November last year but mostly the recovery of global air travel in the past months. In July, 
worldwide CFM flight cycles increased to 103 percent of 2019 levels. Only Europe, which is affected by the closure 
of Russian airspace, and the Asia Pacific region are behind. 
Increased flight cycles mean that there is more demand for spare parts and MRO work for the new-generation 
LEAP engines, but also for the CFM56. Because of the delivery delays at Airbus[2] and Boeing, older-generation 
A320ceo's and 737NGs continue to fly. Andris pointed to the low retirement level of the CFM56-powered aircraft of 
just 94 in the past six months. 
2.000 shop visits this year 
CFM says it is on track for shop visits of 2.000 CFM56 engines this year. As CFM CEO Gal Mheust explained 
during a pre-Paris Airshow presentation, of the 24.000+ CFM56-5B and -7B engines that are in service, some 
11.000 have yet to do their first shop visit. This gives aftermarket sales plenty of opportunities to grow in the coming 
years. CFM will provide spare parts for the CFM56 until at least 2040. 
Andris confirmed that CFM delivered 785 LEAP engines in HY1, in line with what GE Aerospace[3] said on 
Tuesday. This is up 69 percent versus the same period of last year and up fourteen percent on Q1. CFM is on 
target to deliver 1.700 LEAPs this year. The engine maker has a backlog of some 9.600 engines, thanks to recent 
orders from Ryanair, Avolon, and Jet2. This excludes the 800 engines announced this month as part of the large Air 
India order. 
While its rival Pratt & Whitney is suffering from a range of issues with its Geared Turbofan and has only a limited 
number of spare engines available, Andris is proud that CFM has sufficient spare engines. 'We have a policy of 
CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran
keeping our customers flying. This is a real difference to our competitor. We keep our airlines flying all the time. 
There is no disruption, never.'As reported today, the Safran CEO confirmed that CFM has been confronted with a 
similar powder metal contamination problem[4] as P&W, but the problem seems to be on a lower scale. 
HY1 results 
Safran Group, which includes Propulsion, Equipment & Defense, and Aircraft Interiors, posted a net profit in HY1 of 
€1.085 billion compared to €551 million in the same period of last year. Consolidated adjusted revenues increased 
to €10.945 billion from €8.560 billion. The recurring operating income was €1.397 billion, up from €1.047 billion. 
Free cash flow was €1.463 billion, thanks to advanced payments for Rafale fighter aircraft. 
Aerospace Propulsion, which includes civil, military, and helicopter engines, contributed €5.677 billion to this result 
and produced a €1.046 billion profit from operations. Equipment & Defense generated €4.1 billion in revenues and 
reported a €459 million operating profit. 
Aircraft Interiors including cabins and seats recorded €1.163 billion in revenues, which is still 41 percent below 2019 
levels. The unit was loss-making at €-100 million and subject to €38 million in impairments. This is attributed to 
lower Business Class seat deliveries, notably to Boeing for the 787. Safran is also waiting for certification of other 
new cabin products, so was confronted with development costs and cost overruns. Aftermarket sales were back at 
2019 levels in June. 
Aircraft Interiors should reach break-even by the end of this year, thanks to further cost optimizations that include 
the transfer of activities from the US to Mexico and from Germany to Tunisia. Safran has a market share of 35 
percent in cabins and seats and sees strong demand for its products, which makes it confident about the future. 
Safran continues to be affected by high inflation and supply chain[5] issues, notably in the production of landing 
gears. On the positive side, the weaker US dollar has a positive effect on sales. During HY1, Safran, Airbus, and 
Tikehau Ace Capital completed the acquisition of Aubert & Duval, a key supplier of metallic parts to the engine and 
aircraft maker. The three shareholders will invest €300 million in the company over the next four years.

Quote[2] 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €663 million in first-quarter fiscal 2024, up 
more than 100% year over year. Total operating costs grew 23% to €2.94 billion, owing to higher fuel (+30% to 
€1.34bn), staff costs and higher air traffic control fees. 
The load factor increased to 95% in the reported quarter from 92% in the year-ago quarter. 
Average fares in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were up 42%. 
Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. 
Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong

second-quarter 2023 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 and 
declined 25.2% year over year. 
JBHT's total operating revenues of $3,132.6 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,347.5 million 
and fell 18.4% year over year. The downfall was due to a decline in revenue per load of 24% in Integrated Capacity 
Solutions, 13% in Intermodal, 21% in Truckload and a 4% decline in productivity in Dedicated Capacity Solutions on 
the back of changes in customer rate, freight mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. 
Total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased 14% year over year. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[5] reported better-than-expected revenues and EPS, driven by strong air-travel demand. DAL's 
second-quarter 2023 EPS (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.68 comfortably beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $2.42. DAL reported EPS of $1.44 a year ago, dull compared to the current scenario, as air-
travel demand was not so buoyant then. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Up Y/Y
DAL's total revenues of $15,578 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,991.6 million. Total revenues 
increased 12.69% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher air-travel demand. 
United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) reported second-quarter 2023 EPS of $5.03, which outpaced the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $3.99 and improved more than 100% year over year. 
Operating revenues of $14,178 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,927.1 million. UAL's revenues 
increased 17.1% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. The year-over-year increase in the top line was 
driven by a 20.1% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 91.7% of the top line) to $13,002 million. Nearly 42 
million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the second quarter.

 Strong leisure traffic helpedAlaska Airlines[1] to produce a solid Q2 net profit of $240 million, up 74 percent over 
the same period last year. High fares contributed to the result, but the airline is expecting them to drop in the current 
third quarter and coming months, a trend also noticed by Ryanair earlier this week. 
The $240 million net profit compares to $139 million in Q2 last year. Excluding special items and fuel hedge 
accounting adjustments, the profit is $387 million. The pre-tax margin reached 18.3 percent, which must be a 
record-high for the industry, said CEO Ben Minicucci in Tuesday's earnings call. This compares to a $-142 million 
net lossin the first quarter.[2] 
Total revenues were $2.838 billion, up from $2.658 billion in Q2 2022. Of this, passenger revenues were $2.598 
billion (2022: $2.418 billion), $170 million from the Mileage loyalty program and other revenues, and $70 million 
from cargo ($65 million). Departures were down 1.3 percent this quarter, but thanks to more Boeing[3] MAX 9s in 
the fleet, higher gauge and higher utilization exceeded 2019 levels by four percent. Capacity was up 9.9 percent 
year on year. 
Unit revenues were down 2.9 percent compared to 2022, but Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Harrison blamed 
this on a 'noisy' year due to volatile pricing and capacity. Other airlines have stated too that Q2 2022 was 
exceptionally strong, which makes a direct comparison difficult. Compared to Q2 2019, unit revenues were up 23 
percent in the quarter and even 25 percent in June. Premium cabins continued to sell strong and were up twelve 
percent over last year. They contributed 31 percent to all revenues in Q2. 
Surge in international demand hurts Alaska 
Harrison also noted another trend seen by Alaska: an unprecedented surge in international demand. 'We believe 
that pent-up international demand has had the effect of a larger pull from would-be domestic travelers than has 
historically been the case. Long-haul international seats off the West Coast are up 31 percent year over year this 
June.' He added that enough Alaska customers have been redeeming Mileage miles to fly internationally to fill 
eighteen Boeing 787s. 
'While we believe this will eventually normalize, there is a disproportional impact on our domestic fares in the third 
quarter, which we estimate could impact our revenue performance by a half to one percent,' Harrison said. He 
Alaska Airlines: high air fares have reached their peak
noted that Business travel is still down at 75 percent of 2019 levels, blaming it on the weakened technology sector 
in California. The West Coast is the least recovered area anyway. 
Expenses were up to $2.501 billion from $2.471 billion. Thanks to a hedging benefit, the fuel bill was lower this 
quarter to $573 million versus $776 million last year. Noticeably higher were landing fees, catering, and aircraft 
maintenance. The operating result was $337 million, up from $187 million. 
For HY1, Alaska Airlines Group including Horizon Air reported a $98 million net profit, up from a $-4 million loss last 
year. Revenues grew to $5.034 billion from $4.339 billion, of which $4.582 billion came from passenger tickets. 
Cargo revenues were up by $5 million to $128 million. Total expenses increased to $4.883 billion ($4.354 billion), 
with the fuel bill ten percent higher year on year to $1.238 billion. The operating profit for the period was $151 
million ($-15 million). 
The Alaska Group ended June with $2.4 billion in unrestricted cash and marketable securities. Long-term debt 
stood at $1.9 billion. 
Leisure fares are coming off their peaks 
Alaska is still seeing very strong demand and record-high yields. But things are changing, as Minicucci remarked. 
'Leisure fares have recently started to come down from their peaks. Delivering on our targets will not be without 
challenges, but we remain focused on restoring the tendance of our resilient business model, driving improvements 
in efficiency and productivity, and controlling unit costs to deliver strong financial performance.' 
Another trend seen in June is that customers book very close in. They did even more than in 2022 and in 2019. 'If 
this trend persists, this represents an additional 100 bases points of revenue upside to our current third quarter 
guide.'  
The airline expects Q3 revenues to be between zero and three percent up at a ten to thirteen percent higher 
capacity. This will bring unit results by nine percent, as a six-point deceleration on Q2 performance, said Harrison. 
Half of this can be attributed to lower fares, while the other half comes from domestic industry capacity growth, 
stage-length growth, and holiday timing shifts. 
Investors not convinced 
Alaska is confident that it will hit its financial targets this year, counting on a revenue growth of eight to ten percent 
year on year, a one to three percent reduction in costs, a pre-tax margin of nine to twelve percent, and earnings per 
share of $5.50 to $7.50. Full-year capacity should be up eleven to thirteen percent and that for Q3 by ten to thirteen 
percent, thanks to a higher completion rate and more operational resilience, and higher productivity. 
This outlook didn't convince investors on Tuesday. After Alaska released its results, stock prices tumbled down 
from $50.36 to close at $46.45 as investors think that the airline might be adding too much capacity during Q3. 
Minicucci praised Boeing for being able to consistently deliver new aircraft to Alaska Airlines, despite the various 
production issues. The airline took delivery of eight MAX 9s during the quarter, which brought the fleet to 51. It also 
inducted six Embraer[4] E175s for Horizon Air to grow the fleet to 39. As announced before, Alaska will phase out 
the last Airbus[5] A321neo by the end of September to become an all-Boeing operator.

 Ryanair[1] expects that aircraft delivery delays will affect the number of passengers carried for the full financial year 
2024 by 1.5 million compared to the original target. The airline counts on carrying 183.5 million passengers in FY24 
now compared to the previously planned 185 million, it said on July 24 in its Q1 FY24 release. The shortfall is 
slightly higher compared to what Ryanairsaid in May[2] when it anticipated it to be one million passengers. Aircraft 
delays cost Ryanair 1.5 million passengers in FY24. 
Delivery delays caused by the tailfin fitting issues on the Boeing MAX already affected the planned capacity in the 
airline's first quarter, which runs from May to June. This coincided with Boeing needing extra time for inspections 
and repairs of the aircraft that were either in production or awaiting delivery. 
Boeing is three months late on deliveries to Ryanair. The airline took delivery of 21 MAX 8200s in its Q1, bringing 
the fleet to 119 aircraft by the end of June. In July, five 'Gamechangers' were supposed to be delivered to grow the 
fleet to 124. Until the closing of FY24 in March 2024, the carrier counts on 51 deliveries to bring the fleet to 173 
aircraft. However, it has indications that two deliveries will slip from April to May or June 2024 and affect capacity 
for the 2024 summer period, which is Ryanair's Q1/Q2 FY25. 
Adding to the well-known supply chain issues that affect Boeing and the tailfin issues, another issue could hurt 
deliveries of 86 deliveries that are scheduled for summer 2024 and summer 2025. The collapse of a railway bridge 
over the Yellowstone River (Montana) has severed a lifeline of Boeing's 737/MAX fuselage supplies going into 
Renton, forcing the airframer to use trucks to carry them by road and then load them on train cars again. Ryanair 
said it is unable to quantify the effect this will have on deliveries in HY2 of FY24. 
With the first of150 MAX 10s[3] (plus 150 options) that were ordered in May not coming until 2027, these aircraft 
deliveries are unaffected by the current issues. Including MAX 8200 and MAX 10 deposits, Ryanair expects capital 
expenditures of €2.8 billion in FY24 and €1.3 billion in FY25.

Strong Q1 profit 
Ryanair reported a strong Q1 net profit of €662.9 million compared to €170 million in April-June 2022. Michael 
O'Leary attributed the result to Easter and a second bank holiday in May for the coronation of King Charles falling 
into its Q1. He noted that last year's Q1 had been very weak and heavily distorted by the effects of the war in 
Aircraft delays cost Ryanair 1.5 million passengers in FY24
Ukraine. The parent airline and subsidiaries Buzz, Malta Air, and Lauda carried 50.4 million passengers versus 45.5 
million last year. The load factor increased by three percentage points to 95 percent. 
Total revenues were €3.649 billion, up from €2.601 billion. Ticket revenues grew to €2.474 billion from €1.576 billion 
and ancillary revenues to €1.176 billion from €1.025 billion. Per passenger, revenues were up by 27 percent thanks 
to fares that were up 42 percent to €49. 
Operating expenses increased by 23 percent to €2.938 billion, primarily due to 30 percent higher fuel costs at 
€1.338 billion. Staffing costs were up 31 percent to €360 million, reflecting the restoration of pay cuts, pay 
increases, and higher crewing ratios as Ryanair invested in more operational resilience. It doubled operations 
centers in Dublin and Warsaw. Excluding fuel, unit costs ended at €31, which according to Ryanair is well ahead of 
its next competitor Wizz Air at €47. 
The operating profit was €711.2 million, up from €219.6 million in Q1 last year. Ryanair ended June with €980 
million in net cash and €4.8 billion in gross cash. In August, the carrier will repay a second €750 million bond, using 
internal cash resources. Debt will be fully repaid over the next three years.  
Operations were significantly affected by French ATC strikes, which add up to sixty days since January. O'Leary 
once again called on the European Commission to act and protect overflying flights of France during strikes instead 
of forcing airlines to cancel or reroute flights. A petition that was signed by 1.1 million customers was presented to 
the EC in May, but nothing seems to have happened since then to improve the situation. 
Q2 bookings are good but a little softer 
In its outlook, Ryanair expects Q2 traffic to be up by another eleven percent, but O'Leary warned that fares will be 
notably weaker compared to the very strong same quarter of last year. 'Because of price stimulation, we had a very 
strong snap-up in Q2 last year. Because we had a very strong Q2, our performance this Q2 will not be as strong as 
it was in Q1. We expect fares to be above the prior year but at a low double-digit figure.'  
Q2 bookings have been strong but are a little bit softer in the past weeks, so the outcome of HY1 will depend on 
bookings in August and September. Ryanair and its subsidiaries will carry 3.200 flights and almost 600.000 
passengers every day this summer, its largest-ever summer schedule. It opened three new bases in Tenerife, 
Lanzarote, and Belfast and added 190 new routes. This brings summer capacity to 125 percent of 2019 levels. 
Continued high inflation might affect bookings in HY2 and may require more price stimulation through lowering 
fares. Together with higher fuel costs, this gives Ryanair almost no visibility for the second half of the year, although 
O'Leary is cautiously optimistic that profit after tax will be around the €1.4 billion level of FY23. The airline has 
hedged fuel costs for FY24 at 83 percent and at 27 percent for FY25.

 Hundreds of families have headed off to the sun as Teesside International Airport enjoyed its busiest day since 
returning to public ownership. 
Around 2,000 passengers packed the airport on Saturday to board sold-out flights to destinations including Faro in 
Portugal, Spain's Alicante and Palma in Majorca. The first Saturday of the school holidays, known as the Summer 
Getaway, is always one of the busiest in the summer vacation calendar and Teesside is no exception. 
Holidaymakers were at the busy airport terminal early as flights to Amsterdam and Corfu were the first to take to the 
skies. The airport is now on course to record its highest annual passenger numbers since 2011. It is likely to beat 
the 173,000 traveller total in 2022, with numbers currently up by around 20 per cent year-on-year. 
Teesside Airport returned to public ownership in 2019 and has expanded its list of destinations, with airport bosses 
now looking to add further routes. The expansion follows 3m of investment in the terminal building which has seen 
the return of Duty Free and the opening of the Bannatyne Airport Spa. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'When we took the airport back into public ownership we faced a 
huge task in turning around its fortunes. Since then, we have steadily grown and are now on course for our best 
year yet by delivering the flights and destinations the people of Teesside, Hartlepool and Darlington want. 
'We have much more yet to do however and are working hard to further grow passenger numbers and bring in new 
businesses in our drive to return the airport to profitability as part of our business plan.' 
Teesside, named the UK's second most punctual airport in 2022, has now grown to enjoy its largest selection of 
airlines, schedules and destinations since being brought back into public ownership. Passengers jetted off to 
holiday hotspots with airline Ryanair, which runs year-round flights to Alicante, alongside Faro in Portugal, Majorca 
and Corfu. 
TUI, one of the UK's biggest holiday companies, has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-
weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity of the route last year. It is also offering a service to Antalya, 
Turkey, ahead of introducing flights to the country's popular Dalaman destination in 2024. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating its service to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are going further afield easier 
than ever with KLM's three-times daily service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Teesside International Airport celebrates 'busiest day' following 3m investment
Work has also recently started on the new Business Park South on the airport's southside, which is set to create 
4,400 jobs when fully operational. This week also saw the airport's 2.5m cargo handling facility enjoy its best week 
for business since it was officially launched just under a year ago.

 Irish low-cost airline group Ryanair [1]is committing heavily to the Ukrainian aviation sector by promising to base 30 
aircraft in the country when the war is over and Ukraine is declared safe to fly to and from by EASA. Ryanair 
commits to five-year growth plan for Ukraine. 
Top management, including Group CEO Michael O'Leary, made this commitment during a visit to Kyiv and Boryspil 
International Airport on Thursday. 
The airport has been closed for commercial services since February 24 last year, when Russia launched attacks on 
Ukraine and its 'special military operation'.  
While Kyiv has come under frequent attacks from rockets and drones, Boryspil has remained largely unscathed. 
O'Leary and CEO Eddie Wilson were shown around the airport by CEO Olyksiy Dubrevskyy and Oleksandr 
Kubrakov, Ukrainian Minister of Transportation amongst others. 
This confirmed that the terminal building, check-in area, bagage and boarding areas, and apron are in a good 
condition. They could become operational relatively quickly once the airport reopens. 
First services to start after eight weeks 
O'Leary said that Ryanair is committed to return to Ukraine within eight weeks after hostilities have ended. The 
carrier intends to operate 600 weekly flights to and from Kyiv, Odesa, and Lviv as soon as the airports are 
reopened. Other airlines, notably airBaltic, have also said before that they will be the first to operate to Ukraine after 
the war. 
The Ukrainian government and Ryanair said today that under a five-year plan, the airline will grow seat capacity to 
five million in the first twelve months. After five years, this should have doubled to ten million seats. The airline 
intends to base thirty aircraft at the three main airports, which equals a $3.0 billion fleet investment. Once it is safe, 
Kharkiv and Cherson will be added to the network. 
In a media statement, O'Leary says: 'Ryanair was Ukraine's second largest airline before the unlawful Russian 
invasion in Feb 2022. Once the skies over Ukraine have reopened for commercial aviation, Ryanair will charge 
back into Ukraine linking the main Ukraine airports with over 20 EU capitals, and we are working closely with the 
Ukrainian Government to rebuild Ukraine's aviation, industry and its economy.' 
Ryanair commits to five-year growth plan for Ukraine
Dubrevskyy said: 'The visit of Ryanair senior management to Boryspil Airport is a powerful signal that the largest 
airline in Europe sees huge potential in the Ukrainian air transport market. We, meanwhile, are ready to move from 
strategic planning to specific operational actions when the airspace becomes open and safe for civil aviation. I 
strongly believe that Boryspil Airport will remain the main air gate for the return of our citizens to Ukraine and will 
continue to play a leading role in the recovery of the Ukrainian economy.'

Jul 20, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Transportation group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are 
outperforming their peers. Is Matson (MATX) one of those stocks right now? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-
date performance in comparison to its Transportation peers, we might be able to answer that question. 
Matson is one of 131 companies in the Transportation group. The Transportation group currently sits at #13 within 
the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst 
in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings 
outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over 
the next one to three months. Matson is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MATX's full-year earnings has moved 6.2% higher within the past quarter. This 
means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving. 
Based on the most recent data, MATX has returned 31.9% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Transportation 
group have gained about 15% on average. As we can see, Matson is performing better than its sector in the

 * The company secures 4th place in Romania, by market share HiSky continues to break records in the growth rate 
of passenger numbers. 
537 thousand people flew with HiSky in 2023, according to the traffic data, reported after the first two quarters. By 
comparison, in the first six months of the previous year, the company recorded 194 thousand passengers. 
According to estimates based on the scheduled flights this season, the number of one million transported 
passengers, this year, will be reached in September. The report consolidates HiSky's position as the fourth largest 
airline operator in the Romanian market, after Wizzair, Ryanair, and Tarom, and the second most important airline 
registered in our Romania. The most significant traffic volume was recorded in June, with 160 thousand 
passengers, double compared to 2022, followed, in order, by the months of May and April with 110, respectively 
107 thousand. The growth trend is expected to remain constant, with August predicted to be the busiest month in 
the company's history. "We anticipated that this year's summer season would get close to 2019 values in terms of 
demand for passenger air transport services. Our company started operating in 2020, so this is the first season 
where we have the opportunity to demonstrate our capacity in a well-performing market. The pandemic years, 
although extremely complicated, gave us time to prepare for this growth. We purchased new aircraft and managed 
to build a fleet that we can rely on, so as not to have to cancel flights due to technical issues. We operate on regular 
routes to the most sought-after destinations and have concluded partnerships with the largest tour operators. This 
series of good decisions that we managed to make is fully reflected in the figures." says Iulian Scorpan, CEO of 
HiSky. In terms of traffic by operational base, Otopeni remains the airport with the most significant contribution to 
recorded volumes, with 252 thousand passengers, followed by Chisinau airport, with 152 thousand, and Cluj, with 
92 thousand. The spectacular increase in the number of passengers, this spring and the first month of the summer 
season, is also due to the addition of operational capacity, up to eight aircraft. Along with the two Airbus A321LRs, 
included in the fleet at the beginning of April, another aircraft was contracted, leased from a foreign company. Thus, 
HiSky reaches a capacity of nearly 1500 seats. HiSky operates direct international flights from Romania departing 
from the airports of Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, Ia?i, and Baia Mare to Barcelona, Malaga, Tel Aviv, 
Brussels, Paris, and Dublin. From the Republic of Moldova, passengers can travel with HiSky to nine foreign 
destinations: Milan, Paris, Dublin, Frankfurt, Tel Aviv, Rome, Bologna, London and Venice. (PHoto:HiSky)

Gatwick Airport staff to strike at start of summer holidays

 Almost 1,000 workers at Gatwick Airport, including baggage handlers and check-in staff, will stage eight days of 
strikes from later this month. 
Staff will strike in a dispute over pay, the union Unite announced, at the start of the school summer holidays. 
Significant disruption, delays and cancellations are 'inevitable', the union said. 
The workers will strike initially for four days beginning on Friday 28 July and ending on Tuesday 1 August. 
A further four days of strikes are scheduled to take place from Friday 4 August until Tuesday 8 August. 
Hundreds of thousands of flights across Europe this summer are already in jeopardy following a vote by air traffic 
controllers to take strike action. 
Up to 12,600 flights every day - around a third of the journeys made across the continent during the peak summer 
holiday period - could be delayed or cancelled as a result of the industrial action. 
Workers at Eurocontrol, which manages European airspace, have said they will walk out in a dispute over pay, 
working hours and staffing issues. 
An industry source told The Times newspaper: 'In a full-blown strike, 20 to 30% of flights would be at least delayed.' 
Budget airline easyJet announced earlier this month that it had been forced to cancel 1,700 flights during the peak 
summer holiday season in response to the impact of air traffic control strikes in Europe and knock-on effects of the 
closure of airspace due to the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The airline said it would mostly consolidate some services to and from Gatwick Airport, its busiest operation, 
between July and September in a bid to eradicate the threat of disruption to its customers' holiday plans. 
It said that Gatwick flights had been most exposed to strikes in France. 
Ryanair, which has blamed the air traffic controllers' action for disruption to 1.1 million passengers, has previously 
called for the European Commission to intervene to protect services. 
A Eurocontrol spokesperson said earlier this month that a trade union 'announced a period of six months during 
which industrial action could take place' in its network manager operations centre. 
'No specific dates for industrial action have been announced; this was a pre-warning,' they said. 
The company is 'actively engaging with all social partners' and is 'committed to finding solutions through social 
dialogue', the spokesperson added. 
Gatwick Airport staff to strike at start of summer holidays
Last month, security staff at Heathrow Airport called off all strikes and voted in favour of a pay deal. 
Members of the Unite union had been due to walk out across nearly every weekend from mid-June until the end of 
August. 
The pay deal included a 10% pay increase backdated to 1 January, effective from workers' July payslip; a further 
pay rise of 1.5% from October; and a guaranteed inflation-linked pay increase for 2024. 
Unite said the agreement was equivalent to an increase of between 15.5% and 17.5 %, depending on staff pay 
bands. 
The deal also promised improved maternity and paternity pay, the end of switching staff between terminals without 
warning and the end of placing agency workers in security roles, as soon as Heathrow can make the changes. 
Meanwhile, at Birmingham Airport, around 100 security officers and terminal technicians will begin continuous strike 
action from 18 July. 
The strikes will severely impact the airport's security and terminal maintenance, leading to flight delays, the Unite 
union said.

 The Zacks Airline[1] industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-
19 travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in 
demand for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher 
passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Notably, the Zacks Airline[1] industry has risen 37.7% so far this year, outperforming 12.6% growth of the broader 
Zacks Transportation[2] sector and the 17.4% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

The buoyancy in the industry is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank[3] #45, which places it in the top 18% 
of more than 250 Zacks industries. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa HoldingsCPA[4], Azul S.A. AZUL[5], Gol Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes GOL[6] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[7] reported impressive traffic numbers for May. CPA

June on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In June, available seat 
miles (a measure of capacity) increased 10.7% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, 
the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.8% from 83.7% in June 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul, reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for June 2023. AZUL's 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of 
capacity) increased 15% and 12.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With consolidated passenger traffic 
growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor improved to 80.9% from 79.3% in June 2022.

factor increased to 79.1% from 78% in June 2022. Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat 
kilometers increased 92.8% and 94.2%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 87.3%.

demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in June was 17.4 million. This compared favorably 
with the May 2023 figure of 17 million and 15.9 million in June 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor was

 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

Jul 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, JetBlue Airways JBLU[1] management announced that it has commenced operating non-stop 
daily flights to Paris from New York's John F. Kennedy International or JFK Airport. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[2] was also in the news, courtesy of its deal with El Al Israel Airlines in an attempt to boost 
connectivity between the United States and Israel. European carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] grabbed 
headlines by virtue of its stellar traffic numbers for the month of June despite multiple flight cancellations. Recap of 
the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. DAL's agreement with El Al Israel Airlines involves reciprocal codeshare 
and frequent flyer benefits, allowing passengers to earn and redeem miles on both carriers. Initially, customers will 
be able to check in for their entire journey and have their boarding passes issued and bags checked through to their 
destination. We believe that the decision to ink a deal with El Al is a prudent move by Delta's management. By 
expanding its network and improving connectivity, this Atlanta-based carrier can attract more customers and 
generate additional revenues. The ability to earn and redeem miles on both carriers will also appeal to frequent 
flyers, potentially increasing customer loyalty[4]. Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
Delta was also in the news recently courtesy of its bullish guidance for the second quarter of 2023, owing to the 
highly impressive air travel demand scenario. That news was covered in detail in the previous week[6]'s writeup. 
2. The launch of flights to Paris marks JetBlue's expansion into continental Europe, filling a gap in its network and 
meeting the demands of its customer base. With daily flights connecting New York to Paris, the success of its 
London service and upcoming routes to Amsterdam, JetBlue is disrupting the dominance of high-fare legacy 
carriers in the transatlantic market. The airline's decision to expand its presence in the transatlantic market is a 
prudent one given the upbeat air travel demand scenario. The routes should generate significant traffic, in turn 
boosting[7] JetBlue's top line. 
3. Despite having to cancel over 900 flights in June due to air traffic control strikes, Ryanair carried the maximum 
passengers ever in a month. The low-cost carrier transported 17.4 million passengers, compared with 15.9 million 
in June 2022. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) was an impressive 95% for the month.

4. According to a Reuters report[8], JetBlue Airways' management has decided not to appeal against the federal 
judge's ruling in May to terminate the alliance with American Airlines AAL[9] in the Northeast as it was anti-
competitive. JetBlue's management, however, strongly disagrees with the court ruling. Despite that, JBLU will not 
appeal against the decision to save its impending $3.8 billion buyout of Spirit Airlines SAVE[10]. Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index gaining 2.1% to $79.14. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
appreciated 41.3%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Delta is scheduled to kickstart the second-quarter earnings 
season for airlines on Jul 13. Investors will keenly await DAL's performance amid this bullish air-travel demand 
scenario.

Jul 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Werner Enterprises, Inc. WERN[1] is benefiting from its shareholder-friendly initiatives. The company's efforts to 
boost its shareholder value via dividend payouts and share repurchases are commendable. 
WERN has a consistent record of paying out dividends since 1987. The latest dividend hike was in May 2023, when 
it raised the quarterly dividend by 7.7% to 14 cents per share (56 cents annually). 
WERN has been consistently making efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, 
which are encouraging. In May 2022, WERN announced an 8.3% hike in the dividend to 13 cents per share 
(annualized 52 cents). 
In first-quarter 2023, Werner paid out $8.22 million in dividends but did not repurchase any shares. As of Mar 31, 
2023, WERN had 2.3 million shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization. In 2022, Werner paid out 
$32.2 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $110.40 million. In 2021, Werner paid out $29.08 million in 
dividends and repurchased shares worth $104.44 million. 
We believe that such shareholder-friendly initiatives boost investors' confidence and positively impact the stock's 
bottom line. So far this past year, shares of Werner have gained 8% compared with the 21.3% rise of the industry[2] 
it belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
On the flip side, rising operating expenses pose a threat to Werner's bottom line. The company's total operating 
expenses rose 14.4% to $779.3 million in the March-end quarter. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair currently carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Copa Holdings CPA[4] 
and CSX Corporation CSX[5]. Copa Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and CSX carries a Zacks Rank 
#2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Copa Holdings has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.42% for the current year. CPA delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 14.60%, on average. 
Werner ( WERN ) Rides on Dividends & Buybacks Despite Expenses
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CPA's current-year earnings has improved 25.5% over the past 90 days. 
Shares of CPA have soared 32.5% over the past six months. 
CSX has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.09% for the current year. CSX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.76%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX's current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of CSX have risen 6.6% over the past six months.

Jul 05, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair HoldingsRYAAY[1] benefits from improved traffic growth, which implies increased passenger volume. 
Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic from the 
pandemic lows. Ryanair has raised its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 185 million (prior view: 168 million). Ryanair's 
fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1,908.7 million and improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair recently reported highly impressive traffic numbers for June 2023, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in June was 17.4 million. This compared favorably 
with the May 2023 figure of 17 million and 15.9 million in June 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 95% in June 2023. The reading was similar a year ago. 
RYAAY operated more than 96,250 flights in June 2023. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in air-travel demand are encouraging. RYAAY's 
total fleet included 537 aircraft as of Mar 31, 2023. 
Due to buoyant air-travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 48.5% so far this year compared with 37.1% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
On the flip side, more than 900 flights (almost 160,000 guests) were canceled due to air traffic controllers strikes in 
June 2023. 
Rising fuel prices pose a threat to Ryanair's bottom line. The airline's fuel costs increased 113% in fiscal 2023. 
Apart from higher fuel prices, the ramp-up in the airline's operations is pushing up total costs. Operating costs were 
up 75% in fiscal 2023. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Copa Holdings CPA[4] 
and CSX Corporation CSX[5]. Copa Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while CSX carries a Zacks 
Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Copa Holdings has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.42% for the current year. CPA delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 14.60%, on average.

 While "the trend is your friend" when it comes to short-term investing or trading, timing entries into the trend is a 
key determinant of success. And increasing the odds of success by making sure the sustainability of a trend isn't 
easy. 
The trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a 
profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. 
that could keep the momentum in the stock alive. 
Our "Recent Price Strength" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful 
in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental 
strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper 
portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. 
There are several stocks that passed through the screen and Ryanair (RYAAY) is one of them. Here are the key 
reasons why this stock is a solid choice for "trend" investing. 
A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the 
potential upside in a stock. RYAAY is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 18.1% over this period. 
However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal 
that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A 
price increase of 4% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this airline. 
Moreover, RYAAY is currently trading at 98.6% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge 
of a breakout. 
Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of 
more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the 
key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. 
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into 
five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive 
externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 
1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here  > > > >[1] 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Is a Great Choice for 'Trend' Investors, Here's Why
Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 
(Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price 
performance. 
So, the price trend in RYAAY may not reverse anytime soon. 
In addition to RYAAY, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our "Recent Price Strength" 
screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. 
This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing 
style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens[2] that are strategically created to beat the market. 
However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable 
results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard. In addition to allowing you

European Commission positive SAS aid package will stand

Jul 04, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 TheEuropean Commission[1] (EC) has launched an in-depth investigation into the recapitalization of Scandinavian 
airlineSAS[2] during the Covid crisis in 2020. Brussels has no other option but to review the SEK 11 billion state aid 
package after the European Court of Justice annulled the original approval in May. However, the commission is 
positive that the aid package conforms with EU regulations. 
After the first Covid wave in early 2020, SAS immediately launched a restructuring to reduce costs by laying off 
4.000 staff, outsourcing some ground operations, and renegotiating contracts. This would eventually lead to theSAS 
FORWARD[3] transformation plan in February 2022, which SAS hopes to successfully complete after exiting 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection[4]later this year. 
But in 2020, the Swedish and Danish governments as stakeholders of SAS offered SEK 11 billion ($1.0 billion) as 
part of the recapitalization plan[5]. This included SEK 2.0 billion in equity participation through new shares, a rights 
issue of SEK 3.0 billion through the subscription and underwriting of new shares, and SEK 6.0 billion in state hybrid 
notes. The Danish government would participate with SEK 3.5 billion and the Swedish government with SEK 2.5 
billion. 
The two countries notified the European Commission of the package on August 11, 2020. Within a week, on August 
17, the EC approved the state aid under the terms and conditions of the Covid Temporary Framework Plan (TFEU). 
Complaint from Ryanair 
In a complaint submitted to the European General Court of Justice in Luxemburg, Ryanair stated that the aid to both 
SAS and Lufthansa Group was illegal and discriminatory. As reported[6], the Court largely agreed with Ryanair on 
May 10, which means it annulled the approval for the June and August 2020 state aid packages to Lufthansa and 
SAS. 
In the case of Lufthansa, the General Court considered that the EC had based its approval on incomplete and 
wrong considerations. In the SAS ruling, it said that the recapitalization measure granted to SAS did not meet one 
of the conditions set out in the Covid Temporary Framework.  
'In particular, it ruled that the Commission failed to require the inclusion of a step-up mechanism (or an alternative 
mechanism with the same effect as a step-up mechanism) to ensure that Denmark and Sweden would receive a 
European Commission positive SAS aid package will stand
sufficient remuneration for their investment and that SAS would have incentives to buy back the shares acquired by 
Denmark and Sweden as soon as possible,' the Commission said today in a media statement. 
Vestager is confident 
The EC will now have to review its decisions on Lufthansa and SAS, which is expected to take months to reach a 
final decision. While this includes an in-depth investigation, the Commission is confident that the recapitalization aid 
has been justified after all. In the press statement, Executive Vice President for Competition, Margrethe Verstager, 
says: 
'Today's opening decision confirms, on a preliminary basis, that the recapitalization measure is largely in line with 
the conditions set out in the COVID Temporary Framework. The opening addresses the General Court's judgment 
on the absence of a step-up mechanism. If this aspect satisfactorily is addressed, the concerns as expressed by the 
General Court would be resolved. On process, it should be possible to conclude the analysis by the end of the 
year.' 
The Commission notes that the opening of the investigation gives Denmark and Sweden and third parties the 
opportunity to submit comments. 'It does not prejudge in any way the outcome of the investigation.' 
In response to the decision of the Commission, SAS says that it 'welcomes the EU Commission's decision to open 
a formal investigation following the General Court's ruling on 10 May 2023. It is important to reach a robust solution 
to the issue identified by the General Court as quickly as possible.SAS will continue to assist the states of Sweden 
and Denmark as well as the EU Commission in this process.' 
Equity procedure 
Meanwhile, SAS is currently in an advanced stage of its equity solicitation procedure[7] that was launched in May. 
The airline wants to secure some SEK 9.0 billion in fresh equity to restructure debts. SAS said last month that it has 
seen 'substantial interest from potential financial and strategic investors to participate in the process.'  
With final bids now expected four weeks later until September 18, SAS said it hopes to complete the Chapter 11 
procedure a little later now by year-end.

3 Airline Stocks That Appear to be Solid Bets for 2H23

Jul 04, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Airline stocks have been flying high, primarily owing to the uptick in passenger volumes. Air travel demand has 
bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows and is particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more 
encouraging is that international demand is also bouncing back nicely. 
The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil price declined roughly 12% 
in the first six months of 2023. This bodes well for the bottom-line growth of industry participants. This is because 
fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. 
Driven by these positives, the Zacks Airline [1]industry surged 36% in the first six months of 2023 despite economic 
uncertainties, way ahead of the S&P 500's 16.9% rise in the same time period. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
We expect industry participants to continue their good performance in the second half of the year. Given the 
positivity surrounding the industry, we believe that betting on airline stocks like Copa Holdings CPA[2], Allegiant 
Travel Company ALGT[3] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] is a prudent move. Airlines Likely to Continue Flying 
High in 2H: Here's Why Multiple flight cancellations and delays due to unfavorable weather conditions have not 
been able to dampen the demand for travel. Per data provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), 
nearly 2.9 million[5] people moved through checkpoints across the United States on Jun 30, which is higher than 
the corresponding 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels. TSA expects passenger volumes to hit a record in the 
Independence Day holiday period, with 17.7 million people likely to be screened in the Jun 29-Jul 5 time frame. 
With passenger volumes anticipated to remain high throughout the year, air travel is expected to soar over the 
Labor Day holiday period later this year as well. It is also anticipated to be high during winter, thereby keeping 
airlines in good shape. 
This optimism regarding air travel is not limited to the United States only. In June, the International Air Transport 
Association or IATA doubled [6]its current-year profitability (net) forecast for the industry to $9.8 billion from $4.7 
billion. Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of this rosy projection. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are 
now anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue 
forecast indicates a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals. 
3 Airline Stocks That Appear to be Solid Bets for 2H23
The anticipated decline in oil price is corroborated by the fact that average jet fuel cost is expected to be $98.5 per 
barrel in 2023 per IATA, much lower than the earlier forecast of $111.9 per barrel. 
Given the encouraging projections, we have picked three airline stocks, which investors can bet on. These stocks 
carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) presently and have a VGM Score[7] of A. Moreover, the companies 
have witnessed favorable earnings estimate revisions for the current year. Our research shows that stocks with a 
VGM Score of A, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. Price Performance: 1H23 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Our Choices Copa Holdings, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, is 
benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, passenger revenues increased 28.5% 
from first-quarter 2019 levels due to higher yields. 
Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 25.1% upward over the past 60 days. 
Allegiant is seeing a steady recovery in leisure air travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, this Las Vegas, NV-based 
company's operating revenues grew 29.9% on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, accounting for 93.7% 
of the top line, increased 31.3% on a year-over-year basis. 
Allegiant's fleet modernization efforts are encouraging. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALGT's current-year 
earnings has been revised 41% upward in the past 60 days. ALGT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. 
Ryanair Holdings is based in Ireland. Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months 
owing to the rebound in air traffic from COVID-19 lows. The latest upbeat traffic result came in June when the low-
cost carrier transported 17.4 million passengers, compared with 15.9 million in Jun 2022. Load factor (% of seats 
filled with passengers) was an impressive 95% for the month. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are also very encouraging. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's current-year earnings has been revised 7.4% upward in the past 60 days. 
RYAAY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Jun 29, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) scaled a 52-week high of $110.17 in the trading session on Jun 28, 2023, 
before closing a tad lower at $109.48. 
The company's shares have gained 46.5% year to date, significantly higher than 33.7% growth of the industry[1] it 
belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Let's find out the factors supporting the uptick. 
Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic from the 
pandemic lows. Ryanair has raised its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 185 million (prior view: 168 million). Ryanair's 
fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1,908.7 million and improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair recently reported highly impressive traffic numbers for May, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in May was 17 million. This compared favorably with 
the April 2023 figure of 16 million and 15.4 million in May 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage 
of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in May compared with 92% a year ago. The company operated 
more than 94,400 flights in May. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in air-travel demand are encouraging. RYAAY's 
total fleet included 537 aircraft as of Mar 31, 2023. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[2] sector are Copa Holdings CPA[3] 
and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[4]. Each of these companies presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
Copa Holdings has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.42% for the current year. CPA delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 14.60%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CPA's current-year earnings has improved 25.5% over the past 90 days.

 Amazon[1]'s cloud unit, commonly known as AWS, is building a $100 million solution to catch up with Microsoft and 
Google[2] in the market for generative artificial intelligence. 
According[3] to Bloomberg, the upcoming AWS Generative AI Innovation Center will connect Amazon[1] experts in 
AI and machine learning with clients seeking to build applications based on the latest technologies. In generative AI, 
algorithms are used to create new content, such as audio, code, images, texts, simulations, and videos. 
Amazon[1] said Highspot, Twilio, Ryanair and Lonely Planet will be among the first users of the innovation center. 
With the new center, the company expects to sell more cloud services amidst an increasing competition in the cloud 
infrastructure market.  
A recent analysis from Synergy Research Group comparing the biggest cloud services providers shows[4] that 
enterprise spending on cloud solutions reached $63 billion worldwide in the first quarter of 2023, up 20% from the 
same quarter last year. 
Microsoft and Google[2] had the strongest year-over-year growth rates, gaining 23% and 10% in worldwide market 
share, respectively. Amazon[1], the leader in cloud infrastructure, kept its 32% market share in Q1.

'We will bring our internal AWS experts free-of-charge to a whole bunch of AWS customers, focusing on folks with 
significant AWS presence, and go help them turbocharge their efforts to get real with generative AI, get beyond the 
talk,' AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said at Bloomberg's Tech Summit.  
As part of its strategy to stand up against big tech competitors, Amazon[1] recently debuted Bedrock[5], an AI 
solution that allows customers to build out their own ChatGPT-like models. The company also announced the 
upcoming Titan, which includes two new foundational models developed by Amazon[1] Machine Learning. 
On LinkedIn, recent opening positions for AI engineers show Amazon[1] is also preparing to implement a new 
'search' functionality[6] powered by AI for its online web store, with a ChatGPT-like interface.

Why the era of low-cost flights in Europe may be over

Jun 21, 2023( Deutsche Welle Visit Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/visit-germany/s-7550 Delivered by 
Newstex)  
 Environmental concerns are one of several factors driving up airfares. DW explores what's behind the price 
hikes.The days of cheap air fares are over in Europe. In most places, a return to pre-pandemic flight pricing seems 
to be nowhere in sight. This is confirmed, for example, by figures from the German Federal Statistical Office, which 
reported that the average price of an international flight in April 2023 was 33.4% higher than a year prior. 
"Just as we are all currently experiencing huge cost increases, driven particularly by high fuel and energy prices, 
costs are going up for airlines, airports, maintenance companies and service providers," says aviation expert Cord 
Schellenberg. In addition, demand for air travel in Europe has been very high since travel became more affordable. 
But flight capacities are not as high as they were in 2019. "So high demand is meeting tight supply." 
According to figures from the German Aviation Association (BDL), air traffic in Germany last year was 70% of what 
it was in 2019. "This means that the recovery in Germany is slower than in other European countries where in 2022, 
flight offers were at 84% of what they were in 2019," the BDL said in its latest industry report. 
Pricey summer flights  
The online price comparison website Idealo recently reported that summer flight fares were up 20% from last year. 
"At the moment, passengers are willing to pay the higher prices," says Schellenberg. "It remains to be seen whether 
this is due to the catch-up effect — that people can finally travel again after the pandemic — or a general change in 
attitude. Air travel may simply cost more because it used to be too cheap." 
Yet Christoph Brützel, a professor of air traffic management at the International University of Applied Sciences in 
Bad Honnef, Germany, expects prices to drop, at least in the short term. "Next year, they will likely fall again," he 
suspects. Brützel says price drops will result from airlines starting to increase their capacity. 
No more super cheap fares 
Nevertheless, there is much to suggest there will be no return to the sometimes extremely low plane fares of the 
past. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, for example, recently admitted that the days of €10 ($10.80) bargain tickets 
are over. The airline's average ticket prices will rise €40 to €50 ($43-$57) over the next few years, he told the BBC. 
The main reason, he said, is high jet fuel prices. This is confirmed by Harald Zeiss, a professor at Harz University of 
Applied Sciences in Wernigerode, Germany, whose research focuses on sustainability in tourism. "Fossil fuels will 
become very expensive," he says. "If you rely on kerosene, you will have no choice but to pass on the rising costs 
to customers," he told DW. 
Why the era of low-cost flights in Europe may be over
This is especially true as the aviation industry comes under increasing pressure to answer for the environmental 
damage it causes. "The environmental costs of flying should be reflected much more strongly in airfares," says 
Werner Reh, a spokesman for the transport working group at the environmental protection association BUND. "One 
ton of CO2 causes climate damage amounting to €180 ($195)," he says. The simplest way to price this in, he says, 
is with a kerosene tax. An economy flight from Germany to the Dominican Republic would be about €180 ($195) 
more expensive, he calculates. However, Reh says implementing such a tax at the international level would be 
"extremely difficult." 
Sustainable fuels drive up costs 
The increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is more likely to drive up costs for airlines in the coming 
years. The EU's "Fit for 55" measures, for example, which aim to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 
2030, stipulates that moresustainable aviation fuels are used, including mixed fuels. For airlines, this means fuel 
cost increases of up to 16% per ton compared to pure fossil kerosene, according to a recently presented study by 
auditing firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers Germany. "Those who want to fly more sustainably in the future will have to 
pay more for it," says Jan Wille, co-author of the study. 
Meanwhile, the economic research institute SEO Amsterdam Economics has calculated that the "Fit for 55" 
package will increase the price of a return flight within Europe over a distance of 3,000 kilometers by €45 ($49) by 
2030 and by €65 ($71) by 2035. Meanwhile, in another study, researchers found that eliminating greenhouse gas 
emissions from European aviation by 2050, as targeted, will cost a total of €820 billion ($897 billion). One 
consequence of this, researchers say, will be higher ticket prices.

 The Zacks Airline[1] industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-
19 travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in 
demand for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher 
passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[2], Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes 
GOL[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Azul AZUL[5] reported impressive traffic numbers for the month of May. 
While CPA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), GOL, RYAAY and AZUL carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) 
each. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[6] 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' May traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose 15.8% in 
May on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing capacity. In May, available seat 
miles (a measure of capacity) increased 15.3% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, 
the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.1% from 85.7% in May 2022. 
Gol Linhas also reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity. In May 2023, consolidated 
revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) 
increased 13.1% and 14.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 76.1%. The number of 
flight departures at GOL in May registered a 20.7% year-over-year increase. Consolidated passenger on board rose 
20.1% year over year. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 19.3% on a year-
over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 19.5% in May. International departures 
surged 66.9% in May on a year-over-year basis. The number of seats surged 68.9% internationally. 
On the domestic front, passenger on board rose 19.7% year over year. Internationally, the metric surged 28.9% 
year over year. 
Ryanair Holdings, a European carrier, also reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the month of May, driven 
by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in May was 17 million. This 
compared favorably with the April 2023 figure of 16 million and 15.4 million in May 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the 
Airlines Post Impressive May Traffic Numbers: An Analysis
load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in May compared with 92% a year ago 
operated more than 94,400[7] flights in May. 
Azul, a Brazilian carrier, also reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for the month of 
May 2023. With consolidated passenger traffic growth (8.3%) outpacing capacity expansion (5%), the load factor 
increased to 79.8% from 77.3% in May 2022. 
On the domestic front, load factor increased to 78.2% from 76.3% in May 2022. Internationally, the metric surged to 
85.7% from 85.1% in May 2022. Year-to-date Price Performance In fact, air traffic has been buoyant throughout the 
year leading to significant year-to-date price appreciation in the above stocks. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bullish Projections Confirm Airlines' Buoyancy The impressive traffic 
reports of the above carriers highlight the positivity surrounding the industry. We believe that the current summer 
season is likely to see a further surge in passenger revenues, in turn, aiding airlines' top lines. Per Airlines for 
America, U.S. airlines areanticipated[8]to carry 257 million passengers from Jun 1 to Aug 31, 2023. The projection 
marks an all-time high. 
Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes coupled with the decline in fuel costs the International Air Transport 
Association or IATA doubled[9] its current-year forecast for net profits. Despite economic uncertainties. Passenger 
revenues are the biggest driver of the rosy projection for 2023. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are now 
anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue forecast 
indicates a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals.

Notes: 
At current rates, Boeing might not deliver much more than it did last year. The Paris show is undoubtedly going to 
produce some juicy orders. Same for Airbus and Embraer[1]. Among 2023 YTD deliveries, 48% have gone to three 
customers: Southwest, United, and Ryanair (in that order) Over 55% of Boeing's YTD deliveries are in North 
America.

 In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] and Latin Americas' Gol Linhas' GOL[2] reported 
May traffic. The numbers were aided by an upbeat scenario with respect to air travel demand. Also, owing to the 
buoyant air travel demand scenario, International Air Transport Association or IATA doubled [3]its 2023 net profit 
projection for airlines across the globe. 
American Airlines AAL[4] was another news-maker courtesy of management's decision to introduce an additional 
bag fee on transpacific flights. JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] made an expansion-related update in the past week. Recap 
of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. In May, 17 million passengers availed Ryanair flights. This compared 
favorably with the April figure of 16 million and the May 2022 figure of 15.4 million. Owing to upbeat traffic, load 
factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in May compared with 92% a year ago. 
RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), operated more than 94,400[6] flights in May.You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
AAL was also in the news recently, courtesy of management's decision to lift the second-quarter 2023 earnings per 
share forecast.That update was covered in detail in our previous week's write-up[8]. 
2. In May, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a 
measure of capacity) increased 13.1% and 14.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Load factor was 76.1%. 
The number of flight departures at GOL in May registered a 20.7% year-over-year increase. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 19.3% on a year-
over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 19.5% in May. International departures 
surged 66.9% in May on a year-over-year basis. The consolidated passenger on board metric rose 20.1% year over 
year. 
3. Owing to the buoyant air travel demand scenario, IATA now expects the industry to generate a net profit of $9.8 
billion in 2023 compared with $4.7 billion estimated in December last year. The top line in 2023 is now anticipated 
to be $803 billion compared with the previous estimate of $779 billion. The revised revenue forecast indicates a 
9.7% increase from the 2022 actuals. In the event of the revenue forecast coming true, 2023 would be the first year 
Airline Stock Roundup: IATA 's Bullish Forecast for 2023 Profit, GOL , RYAAY in Focus
since 2019 (pre-pandemic) when total revenues for airlines across the globe would exceed $800 billion. Notably, 
revenues were $838 billion in 2019. 
Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of the rosy projection for 2023. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 
are now anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue 
forecast indicates[9] a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals. 
4. American Airlines has decided to charge $75 for the first checked bag for passengers who booked the cheapest 
tickets (Basic Economy) on several long-distance flights, including those flying to Israel, Australia and India, among 
others. Passengers will be charged $100 for the second bag, $200 for the third bag and so on. This change has 
come into effect from Jun 7. 
5 JetBlue has decided to serve two more destinations, Belize and St. Kitts, as part of the attempt to expand its 
network in the Caribbean. JetBlue will offer nonstop flights (thrice a week: Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays) from 
New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw International Airport in St. 
Kitts from Nov 2. Non-stop flights from JFK to Belize City will take to the skies (on Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
Saturdays) from Dec 6. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index gaining 4.2% to $69.37. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
appreciated 17.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

 Teesside Airport's 2023 summer season is now flying high after the launch of its final route the Greek island of 
Corfu. The packed flight took off on Saturday 3 June, marking the start of the full slate of holiday flights. 
Passengers have been jetting off to holiday hotspots thanks to airline Ryanair, which runs year-round flights to 
Alicante, alongside Faro in Portugal and Majorca, with Corfu their last destination to take off. 
TUI, one of the UK's biggest holiday companies, has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-
weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity of the route last year. It is also offering a service to Antalya, 
Turkey, ahead of introducing flights to the country's popular Dalaman destination in 2024. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating its service to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are going further afield easier 
than ever with KLM's three-times daily service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Teesside was named the UK's second most punctual airport in 2022, with delays of just 11 minutes and nearly half 
of all flights taking off early. This was despite seeing the highest passenger numbers since 2011, with more than 
173,000 people passing through the terminal. 
Passengers have recently taken to social media praising the airport for being 'stress free', the 'excellent customer 
service', a 'great start to the holiday' with one commenter even branding it 'the most pleasurable airport I have ever 
experienced'. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: 'With the 2023 season now entirely up and running, we're continuing to 
welcome our all-important holidaymakers through the terminal to give them the best possible start to their summer 
breaks. Corfu was very popular last year and passengers are just as excited this summer. 
'We had the best holiday period for years in 2022 and I'm sure, thanks to extra flights to Majorca and thanks to 
scrapping the 100ml liquid limit in security, we'll have just as great a year now. 
'We're not resting on our laurels, though, and we're continuing our talks with established airline partners and 
potential new ones to secure even more routes local people are crying out for. This is all the while ensuring the 
airport goes from strength to strength by working to welcome new businesses on-site, help expand existing firms 
and boost our new cargo facility.'

phones. The kiosks allow the customers to check in and print tags in three minutes. 
The bag tags cannot be used to check in — they are for the customer's records. 
Ryanair plans to expand the kiosks to the Shannon and Cork airports.

May 26, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2023. Revenues also beat the consensus mark and increased year over year, owing to upbeat traffic 
volumes. 
American Airlines AAL[2] was also in the news, courtesy of its agreement in principle with its pilot union, Allied 
Pilots Association. Meanwhile, AAL's Northeast Alliance with JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] ran into rough weather 
following a court ruling to end the partnership. Delta Air Lines DAL[4] also grabbed headlines courtesy of its 
decision to appoint a new chief operating officer. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair 
reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) loss of 73 cents per share (excluding a penny from non-
recurring items), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents. In the year-ago reported 
quarter, RYAAY had incurred a loss of 98 cents per share. Revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $1,908.7 million. Revenues improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1.42 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 
against a net loss of €355 million incurred a year ago. Ryanair expects[5] traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 185 million. 
Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents 15,000 plus pilots at AAL, reached an agreement in principle with 
the company. If the collective bargaining agreement materializes, American Airlines pilots would be eligible for a 
21% pay raise this year. Further details will be available shortly. 
3. American Airlines and JetBlue received a major setback when a federal judge ordered the companies to 
terminate their alliance in the Northeast as it was anti-competitive. The verdict is in line with the Justice 
Department's opinion. The Justice Department's antitrust suit, filed more than a year ago, accused the alliance of 
stifling competition. The judge ordered the companies to end the alliance within 30 days of the ruling. Both carriers 
are likely to challenge the decision. In fact, AAL's management said that the ruling will not impact its earnings 
performance. 
4. Delta announced that it will get a new chief operating officer from Jun 12. This Atlanta-based carrier appointed 
Mike Spanos for the new role. Spanos has more than two decades of work experience and has been associated 
with many big companies. Most recently, he was with Six Flags Entertainment SIX[7] as its president and CEO.

gains were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained marginally over the past week. Over

May 23, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) loss of 73 cents per share 
(excluding a penny from non-recurring items), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents. 
In the year-ago reported quarter, RYAAY had reported a loss of 98 cents per share. 
Revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,908.7 million. Revenues improved year 
over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1.42 Billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 
against the net loss of €355 million incurred a year ago. In the same period, operating costs climbed 75% to €9.20 
billion, driven by a 113% increase in fuel expenses to €3.90 billion. 
Average fares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 were up 10% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. Net debt at 
RYAAY declined to €0.56 billion at the fiscal fourth-quarter end from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2022. 
Ryanair raised its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to 185 million (prior view: 165 million). 
Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[1]. Performances of Other Transportation Companies J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.'s JBHT[2] 
first-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.89 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 and declined 17.5% 
year over year. 
JBHT's total operating revenues of $3,229.58 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,434.4 million 
and fell 7.4% year over year. The downfall was due to declines in the volume of 25% in Integrated Capacity 
Solutions (ICS), 5% in Intermodal (JBI) and 17% in Final Mile Services (FMS), and a 17% decline in revenue per 
load in Truckload (JBT). Revenue declines in ICS, JBI, FMS and JBT were partially offset by Dedicated Contract 
Services revenue growth of 13%. 
JBHT's total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased 10.2% year over year. 
Delta Air Lines' DAL[3] first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 82 cents from non-recurring items) of 25 cents per 
share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Volatile fuel prices and unfavorable weather conditions 
led to this downtick. DAL reported a loss of $1.23 per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, 
as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Q4 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Rise Y/Y
DAL reported revenues of $12,759 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,767.4 million.

ALK's operating revenues of $ 2,196 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,202.5 million. The top line 
jumped 31% year over year, with passenger revenues accounting for 90.3% of the top line and increasing 31% 
owing to continued recovery in air-travel demand.

Ryanair could miss out on FY24 target if Boeing deliveries are late

May 22, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair[1] hopes to grow passenger numbers in Financial Year 2024 by ten percent to around 185 million, up from 
168.6 million in FY23. But this will largely depend on new Boeing MAX 8200 deliveries being on time for the peak 
season. With the airframer expecting lower deliveries as it deals with the tailfin quality issue, Ryanair could receive 
aircraft outside the peak season, which could impact total passenger numbers by about one million. Ryanair could 
miss out on FY24 target if Boeing deliveries are late. 
The low-cost airline group that includes Ryanair, Buzz Air, Malta Air, and Lauda reported a €1.428 billion net profit 
attributable to shareholders compared to €-355 million net loss in FY22. The profit excludes a €114 million 
exceptional market-to-market loss on fuel caps. Ryanair's financial year covers March to March. 
While Q4 (January-March) produced a €-154 million net loss and Q1 was also 'disappointing' following a slump in 
air travel after the war in Ukraine, overall, FY23 was a strong year for Ryanair. Total revenues grew to €10.775 
billion from €4.801 billion. Passenger revenues were €6.930 billion, up from €2.653 billion. Ancillary revenues 
increased to €3.845 billion from €2.148 billion, or €23 per passenger. 
The airline group benefitted from 74 percent higher traffic and fares that were up by ten percent. Ryanair says that 
saw particularly strong growth in Italy, where it grew thirteen percent market share to forty percent. Poland jumped 
by ten percent to 36 percent, while Ireland was up by nine percent to 58 percent. The group operated at 116 
percent of pre-pandemic capacity. The load factor reached 93 percent, up from 82 percent in FY22. 
Fuel costs hedged eighty percent 
Operating expenses grew to €9.202 billion from €5.271 billion, with €130.5 million in exceptional fuel costs in FY23 
that in FY22 lowered the fuel bill by the same amount. Ex-fuel unit costs were €31. Fuel costs were 113 percent 
higher to €3.9 billion, the result of 52 percent more sectors flown and higher prices. Costs were offset by the better 
fuel efficiency of the MAX 8200s. The biggest gain of €1.4 billion came from hedging, which was eighty percent in 
FY23. The airline is already hedged 85 percent for FY24, but the bill is still expected to be €1.0 billion higher year 
on year. 
Staffing costs were 73 percent higher to €1.19 billion, also caused by ramping up capacity and the effect of the 
accelerated pay restoration that Ryanair promised it would do after the pandemic. The pre-exceptional operating 
profit was €1.573 billion, up from €-470.1 million in the previous year. 
Largest-ever summer schedule 
Ryanair could miss out on FY24 target if Boeing deliveries are late
Ryanair will operate its largest-ever schedule this summer, with 2.500 routes and 3.000 daily flights with over half a 
million passengers per day. Demand is expected to be still below pre-pandemic levels, but forward bookings are 
strong but remain close in. It repeated its forecast that travel in Europe will benefit from the return of passengers 
from North America and China[2]. Europe will continue to be affected by air traffic control issues, be it strikes are 
capacity constraints. With low visibility for HY2, Michael O'Leary said he expects only a modest growth of profit after 
tax for FY24. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-22.png?ssl=1 
Ryanair is expecting more modest growth from FY27, the year when it will introduce the Boeing MAX 10 into the 
fleet. (Ryanair) 
'The only cloud on our short-term horizon' is the Boeing delivery delays this summer. Ryanair is expecting to be ten 
aircraft short in May, June, and July as Boeing has to do rework on the tailfin fittings[3] of aircraft in production and 
inventory. This could cost Ryanair some 250.000 passengers each month. Boeing said that rework will affect Q2 
2023 deliveries, with aircraft pushed out into Q3. Ryanair has accepted that it will take new aircraft deliveries in July 
and possibly August too. The group grew the MAX 8200-fleet to 98 in FY23, which complements 411 737-800s and 
28 Airbus A320ceo's at Lauda. Lower deliveries reduced Capex by €450 million. The group has unfilled orders for 
112 MAX 8200s that will be delivered over the next three summers. 
MAX 10 order secures controlled growth 
As announced on May 9, Ryanairordered 150 MAX 10s[4] plus 150 options, with the first deliveries starting in 2027. 
This is subject to shareholder approval on September 14, but this is a formality. O'Leary said this huge order 
uniquely positions Ryanair for 'controlled growth in an environment in Europe when capacity will be constrained. () 
The order secures Ryanair's growth for the next decade while many of our competitors will be constrained not just 
by OEM delivery constraints but also by the very full order books.' He is counting on just two percent annual growth 
for some three years from FY27 instead of ten percent this year. 
As the first MAX 10 will join two years after the last MAX 8200 currently on order is delivered, Michael O'Leary 
expects them to be funded primarily from internal sources. However, the airline remains opportunistic in its 
financing options. 
Ryanair ended FY23 with €4.7 billion in cash. It repaid an €850 million bond in March and in May converted an 
unsecured €750 million syndicated term loan into a revolving credit facility at a lower margin that matures in 2028.

 The opposition blogger was arrested in 2021 after his Ryanair flight was diverted and forced to land in Minsk. He 
was sentenced to eight years in prison earlier this month on charges including inciting terrorism.Raman 
Protasevich, the Belarusian opposition blogger arrested two years ago after the plane was on was forced to land in 
Minsk, was pardoned on Monday, the Belarusian state news agency Belta reported. 
"I have literally just signed all the relevant documents stating that I have been pardoned," Belta cited the blogger as 
telling reporters. "This is, of course, great news." 
Protasevich had been sentenced to eight years in a penal colony earlier this month for offenses including inciting 
terrorism, organizing mass disturbances and slandering Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. 
Blogger charged after reporting on anti-government protests 
Protasevich had worked as a journalist at the news outlet Nexta, which reported extensively on mass protests 
across Belarus against Lukashenko in 2020 following a presidential election that the opposition and Western 
governments denounced as rigged. 
The protests, which lasted for months, were the longest and largest demonstration of opposition to Lukashenko 
since he took power in 1994. 
Belarusian authorities responded with a brutal crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested, thousands 
beaten by police and dozens of media outlets and nongovernmental organizations shut. 
Viasna, a Belarusian human rights organization, says nearly 1,500 people have been put behind bars in connection 
with opposition activities. 
Under duress, Protasevich pleaded 'fully guilty' 
After his arrest, Protasevich was believed to have been coerced by authorities into issuing apologetic statements on 
state television.  
When his trial began in February, he said in a video published by Belta that he was "fully guilty." 
Some in the exiled Belarusian opposition have accused him of collaborating with authorities.  
Little is known about how Protasevich was treated by security services.  
Ryanair flight diversion alarmed Europe, world 
Protasevich's arrest shocked law enforcement agencies and aviation authorities around the world 
A Belarusian fighter jet forced his Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk, where he was taken off 
the plane.

Nexta, a popular channel on YouTube and Telegram, played an active role in the 2020 protests, which erupted after 
Lukashenko was accused of rigging an election. 
The platform was banned and declared a "terrorist organization."

 Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old 
investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both. 
Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity 
Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-
assured investor. 
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. 
Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the 
better chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a 
stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value 
Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking 
advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week 
price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate 
favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks. 
Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Momentum Stock
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's 
earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy. 
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still 
has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B. 
Momentum investors should take note of this Transportation stock. RYAAY has a Momentum Style Score of A, and 
shares are up 5.8% over the past four weeks. 
Two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.12 to $6.29 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.5%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

 Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up 
quite nicely for their report. 
That is because Ryanair is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a 
precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date 
information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RYAAY in this 
report. 
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 94 cents per share for RYAAY, 
narrower than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents per share. This suggests that analysts 
have very recently bumped up their estimates for RYAAY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +5.05% 
heading 
into 
earnings 
season.

https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price-eps-surprise?icid=chart-RYAAY-price-eps-surprise 
Ryanair Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] Why is this Important? A positive 
reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and 
outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on 
average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here[4]). 
Given that RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock 
ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ryanair, and that a beat might 
be in the cards for the upcoming report.

 In the past week, Copa Holdings CPA[1] reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for first-
quarter 2023, driven by the upbeat air-travel demand scenario. First-quarter earnings-related updates were 
discussed in theprevious write-up[2]as well. 
Driven by the buoyant passenger-volume scenario, another Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[3] reported rosy 
traffic numbers for the month of February. European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] April traffic report was 
impressive as well. An update on fleet modernization was also available from Ryanair. Meanwhile, United Airlines 
UAL[5] expanded its code-sharing agreement with Azul AZUL[6] in a customer-friendly move. Recap of the Latest 
Top Stories 1 Copa Holdings' first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.99 per 
share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 androse more than 100% year over year. Revenues of 
$867.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.1 million and improved 51.7% year over year on the 
back of passenger revenues. 
Passenger revenues (contributed 96.2% to the top line) increased 28.5% from first-quarter 2019 levels, owing to 
higher yields (up 20%). Cargo and mail revenues jumped 51.8% from first-quarter 2019 actuals to $23.25 million, 
owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Other operating revenues improved 24% to $10 million, owing to 
revenues from non-air ConnectMiles partners. 
For 2023, CPA, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), expects consolidated capacity to grow in the 12-
13% band from 2022 actuals. CPA expects the current-year operating margin to be between 22% and 24%. Load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is expected to be approximately 85%. Fuel price per gallon of $2.85 is 
expected for the current year. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7] 
2. United Airlines widened the scope of its code-sharing partnership with Azul. Under the expanded deal, 
passengers can fly to six new destinations after connecting from the designated Brazilian airports to Orlando or Fort 
Lauderdale on UAL flights. The six new destinations are Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, San Francisco, Washington 
DC, and Los Angeles. The customer-friendly move will allow them to travel using a single ticket for both UAL and 
Azul-operated flights. From May 10, passengers will be able to make easy one-stop connections to the above

destinations with a single ticket. The expanded [8]partnership between the two airline companies was built on their 
existing codeshare routesfromHoustonand Newark. 
3. Ryanair placed a huge order for 150 new 737 MAX-10 planes from Boeing. These planes, expected to be 
delivered between 2027 and 2033, will reportedly [9]replace the aging 737 jets in the airline's fleet. 
On a separate note, 16 million passengers were ferried on RYAAY flights in April. This compared favorably with the 
March figure of 12.6 million and the year-ago number of 14.2 million. Owing to the upbeat traffic, load factor was as 
high as 94% in April compared with 91% a year ago. 
4. For April, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) at Gol Linhas increased 13.6% year 
over year. To match the upbeat demand situation, the company is simultaneously expanding its capacity (measured 
in available seat kilometers). During the same month, capacity grew 12.5% year over year. GOL carried 19% more 
passengers in April compared with the year-ago figure. Consolidated load factor improved to 78.9% in April from 
78.2% a year ago. 
Domestic departures, which accounted for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 17.8% on a 
year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 15.8%. Performance The following 
table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the last five trading days. The NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index increased 3.9% to $59.14. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
declined 3%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for first-quarter 2023 earnings report of Azul on May 15.

 Ryanair has agreed a $40bn (31bn) deal with Boeing that will see it purchase up to 300 new aircraft over the next 
decade. 
Half of the 737-MAX-10 order has been described as firm, with the remaining being options. 
The airline claims this is the largest order ever placed by an Irish company for US manufactured goods. 
Phased deliveries will start in 2027 and run until 2033, with half of the new purchases set to replace older aircraft in 
the Ryanair fleet, boosting efficiency and cutting emissions. 
The new aircraft, which have 228 seats, are to be used to meet Ryanair's traffic which it forecasts will grow by 80% 
and reach 300m passengers a year by 2034. 
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary described the deal as 'the ideal growth aircraft order for Ryanair, our 
passengers, our people and our shareholders'. 
'These new, fuel efficient, greener technology aircraft offer 21% more seats, burn 20% less fuel and are 50% 
quieter than our B737-NGs,' he said. 
He added that the deal would enable Ryanair to create more than 10,000 new high-paid jobs for pilots, cabin crew 
and engineers. 
Given the size and scale of the transaction, it will be subject to shareholder approval at Ryanair's next annual 
general meeting. 
'Landmark deal' 
Boeing's president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said the Boeing-Ryanair partnership is 'one of the most 
productive in commercial aviation history'. 
He said it enabled both companies to succeed and expanded affordable travel for the public. 
'Nearly a quarter century after our companies signed our first direct airplane purchase, this landmark deal will 
further strengthen our partnership,' he added. 
'We are committed to delivering for Ryanair and helping Europe's largest airline group achieve its goals by offering 
its customers the lowest fares in Europe.'

 Can and willLufthansa[1] be forced to repay thestate aid that the airline received as part of the recapitalization plan 
during the Covid crisis in June 2020? That's the question now that the Court of Justice of the European Union[2] 
ruled on Wednesday that the European Commission made mistakes when approving that aid package of the 
German government. The case was filed by Ryanair and Condor Airlines. Will Lufthansa once more have to repay 
the German state aid? 
'The Commission committed several errors, in particular, by considering that Lufthansa was unable to obtain 
financing on the markets for the entirety of its needs, by failing to require a mechanism incentivizing Lufthansa to 
buy back Germany's shareholding as quickly as possible, by denying that Lufthansa held significant market power 
at certain airports, and by accepting various commitments that do not ensure that effective competition on the 
market is preserved,' the General Court says in a media statement.

EU court annuls approval of €6 billion in state aid for Lufthansa

 A European Union court has annulled Brussels' approval for German state aid granted to Lufthansa worth €6 billion 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.The European Commission should not have approved the German government's 
decision to provide Lufthansa with billions of euros in state aid during the coronavirus pandemic, the EU General 
Court ruled on Wednesday. 
Strict EU guidelines against government bailouts of companies were loosened during the pandemic and the 
Commission approved the €6 billion ($6.6 billion) package in June 2020. 
The case against the aid was brought by Ryanair and Condor, which called the state support unfair. 
In its ruling, the court said, "The Commission committed several errors, in particular, by considering that Lufthansa 
was unable to obtain financing on the markets for the entirety of its needs." 
The Commission also misjudged the German airline's market power at certain airports and agreed to conditions that 
did not ensure effective competition between airlines, the EU court found. 
Lufthansa to analyze ruling 
Lufthansa noted that the "stabilization measures" were "already fully terminated before today's court ruling." 
This means it has already paid back the bailout money, making it unclear what effect the ruling will have. 
The airline can appeal the ruling to the European Court of Justice.

MAX10 vs A321 in the European market

 Mr. O'Leary got a deal he could live with, while Mr. Calhoun got a deal he could live with. Does it matter what the 
strike price is? The key number is the operating cost difference between a Ryanair MAX10 and a Wizz Air A321. 
What might the MAX10 vs. A321 in the European market look like? 
As we usually do, we turn to skailark[1]'s excellent cost model to get some ideas. We are starting with a few metrics 
for January 2023. On a broad brush look, Wizz has five areas of advantage over Ryanair, and Ryanair has two 
areas better than Wizz. Wizz only has a 1.3% cost advantage concerning cost per block hour. So the competition is 
tight. 
Source: skailark 
Digging into the data, we discover this when making metrics comparable. 'Burden,' the sum of overhead and fuel, 
accounts for over half the two airline operating expenses. While Ryanair has lower-cost fuel, Wizz has a big 
advantage in overhead. Confirming the table above, the difference between the two is marginal. 
Source: skailark 
Where is the difference, then? Why does Ryanair's O'Leary want the MAX 10? Here is where we think the answer 
becomes clearer. The aircraft shown below are flown by these two airlines; fortunately, there's no crossover to 
muddle the data. Since fuel is the biggest input, we will focus on that. 
Source: skailark 
The MAX8-200 deployed by Ryanair shows a sharp improvement in fuel burn over -800NG (35.4%). Meanwhile, at 
Wizz, the A320neo shows a 23% improved fuel burn over the A320ceo. In these segments, the two are running 
neck and neck. 
When you get to the A321neo, note it burns 12.5% more fuel per seat but seats 230 compared to 200 for the Max 
8-200. At such tight margins, the 15% more capacity means, all things being equal, 15% more revenue. Ryanair 
wants that revenue, and Mr. O'Leary pointedly spoke about the ancillary revenue potential the MAX 10 offers. The 
larger airplane should fly further; therefore, ancillary revenue potential rises - passengers will get thirsty and hungry. 
They likely run out of snacks in their pockets on longer flights. 
The MAX 8-200 does not compete effectively with the A321neo. But the MAX 10 does. The MAX 10 will take longer 
to load and unload. But the comparison with the MAX 8-200 is the wrong one. It should take as long as the 
A321neo, which is the appropriate yardstick. 
MAX10 vs A321 in the European market
If Wizz is Ryanair's most effective competitor in Europe, then the MAX 10 is what Ryanair needs to ensure it 
remains competitive. The final table lists new deliveries for these two airlines from 2021 through 5/8/23. 
Wizz bet on the A321neo, which was a smart move. That model is in very high demand. Ryanair bet on the MAX 8-
200 and was the launch customer - which was a smart move then. But the market shifted. Ryanair can't get the 
MAX 10s soon enough. Although it is a far larger airline, Ryanair does not want Wizz to grow faster because of 
model size. This is going to be a fascinating race to watch.

Ryanair and Boeing finally get a MAX 10 deal done

 Months earlier than anticipated by Michael O'Leary himself,Ryanair[1] has agreed withBoeing[2] on an order for 
150 MAX 10s plus 150 options. In March, the Group CEO of the Irish low-cost airline said that he anticipated 
discussions to take six months or up to a year, but he noticed there had been a willingness on both sides to get the 
deal done, he said during a press conference on Tuesday. Ryanair and Boeing finally get a MAX 10 deal done. 
Remember where this deal is coming from. In September 2021, Ryanairunilaterally ended discussions[3] with 
Boeing as the airframer was to move even an inch to offer the carrier a discount. O'Leary kept saying for months[4] 
last year that there was nothing to report but added that he wasn't in a hurry either as Ryanair had sufficient MAX 
8200s in its unfilled orders list. 
Coming January 2023, things changed and both parties approached each other again, resuming discussions in 
early March. Today O'Leary said that he was surprised about how negotiations with Boeing had gone since then. 
'We wanted to get an order done. We have to recognize what is happening in the industry: both Boeing and Airbus 
see a dramatic rebound in orders. I think Airbus' order book is longer than Boeing's, but Boeing's order book is 
filling up rapidly. On our side, if we didn't move quickly, we might have been looking at later deliveries in 2028 and 
2029 instead of 2027. From Boeing's point, it was in their interest to have a large order from their largest customer 
in Europe. Good things happen when people can move quickly.'  
Getting a discount 
 O'Learytold AirInsight in late March[5] in Brussels that talks focused on more MAX 8200s, but that Boeing was 
pressing on the MAX 10. The CEO said that he would want a significant discount for the MAX 10s if he would buy 
them because at 228 seats the yields per seat would be less favorable than those of the -8200s. 
In today's press conference, O'Leary said that 'there is a big challenge for us in stepping up (from the 189-seat 
737NGs and 197-seat MAX 8200s), in particular when you are delivering six to eight sectors per day (per aircraft) in 
a 228-seat aircraft. We said we would step up to the MAX 10 if we would get a modest discount on the additional 
seats. I am pleased to say we got a very modest discount.' 
He added that with the MAX 10, 'we will have to sell seats at lower prices in the next decade. We have to recognize 
that we have to operate across Europe in a marketplace where many of our so-called competitors are operating the 
230-seat A321neo. I believe the MAX is the better aircraft. We will continue to beat all of our competitors in Europe. 
Ryanair and Boeing finally get a MAX 10 deal done
But it would be very difficult to compete for us going forward in the next decade if we were trying to compete with a 
230-seat Airbus aircraft with a 197-seat Boeing, even how great that aircraft is.' 
A question will be if Ryanair will be able to do 25-minute turnarounds with a 228-seat aircraft. 'We will have special 
training programs for our customers for the next ten years on how to move faster.' 
For replacement and growth 
About half of the 150 aircraft on firm order will replace existing Boeing 737-800s, but the 150 MAX 10s on option will 
be for future growth. Ryanair and its subsidiaries Malta Air, Buzz, and (Airbus operator) Lauda want to carry 225 
million passengers in 2026. The new aircraft should get them to just over 300 million by 2034. 
The group has no interest in opening new, transatlantic markets with the MAX 10, but has planned an expansion 
outside Europe like Morocco, Israel, Egypt, or Jordan. And it is waiting for the day that it can re-enter Ukraine, 
where it was the biggest airline before the war started in February 2022. 
First deliveries in 2027 
Ryanair expects the first deliveries of the MAX 10s in 2027, so it should not be affected by any delays in the 
certification if they will happen this year. 'I know that the FAA is working closely with Boeing and that relationship 
has improved dramatically over the last twelve to eighteen months. We have no fear about the MAX 10s getting 
certified, whether that's in later 2024 or early 2025. It will be well ahead of our first deliveries in 2027. We will work 
with the European regulator EASA to have the aircraft certified in Europe as soon as possible.' 
Boeing will build the MAX 10 on the new, fourth assembly line in Renton in 2024. Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
President and CEO Stan Deal said that the airframer is currently targeting 50 aircraft a month in 2025, but that is 
supply-constrained. A fifth line will only be opened if the constraints will go away.

May 09, 2023( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Teesside Airport has been named the second most punctual in the UK, new figures from the Civil Aviation Authority 
have revealed. 
2022 was the busiest year for more than a decade at Teesside, welcoming more than 173,000 passengers through 
its terminal, up more than 200 per cent on the previous year. At the height of the summer season in July, it was 
named the most punctual, with delays of just 11 minutes and nearly half of all flights taking off early. 
Data on flight delays during 2022 showed that the average delay per departing flight at Teesside was just 14 
minutes, more than half that of the airport with the longest delays (30 minutes) and just one minute off grabbing the 
top spot. 
These figures will be great news for holidaymakers jetting out of the airport as TUI today ( May 9) launches its first 
flights of 2023 to Majorca. From May 27, the airline will double the number of services to the popular destination 
thanks to its successful season last summer. 
Fairs-Lloyds Travel is also reintroducing its travel packages to Jersey on Saturday, ahead of TUI's service to 
Antalya, Turkey, beginning on May 25 and Balkan Holidays' Bulgaria trips on May 27. Ryanair will start its season 
on June 3 with Corfu. 
It will also be 'easier and smoother than ever' for passengers to pass through security to departures after the airport 
became the UK's first to scrap the 100ml liquid requirement, meaning you can carry up to two litres of liquid per 
item. There is now also no need to remove liquid and electronics from bags thanks to its new security scanners. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'These fantastic figures show just how quick, easy and convenient it 
is for people to fly from their local airport this summer. They can get from their car, through check-in and security 
and be relaxing in departures in just minutes, and we're always looking at ways to cut this time even more. 
'Some delays will always be inevitable and outside of our control. But thanks to the investments we've made in our 
terminal and equipment, our staff and by bringing teams in-house, we're almost at the top of the table, even while 
seeing the most passengers since 2011. 
'Last July we were named the most punctual for that month, and our dedicated airport team will do everything they 
can to claw back that minute as we ramp up our 2023 holiday flights to make us the best we can be.'

May 09, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It's a busy time on the investment calendar, for sure: Q1 earnings season is still barely halfway over, economic 
prints on our present inflation situation, political brinksmanship (playing chicken with the debt ceiling) in Washington 
DC and continuing drama over regional banks destabilizing are all vying for attention. Yet this morning, we're a little 
quiet here in the office. 
Mostly, that's because the biggest news items scheduled for this week — tomorrow morning's Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) tomorrow afternoon's Walt Disney Co. (DIS[1]) earnings report — haven't happened yet. There are no 
major economic prints hitting the tape before today's opening bell. After the bell, we will hear from Fed Governor 
Philip Jefferson and New York Fed President John Williams. And after today's close, we'll see new earnings reports 
from Airbnb (ABNB[2]), Twilio (TWLO[3]) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN[4]), among others. 
This morning, UnderArmour (UAA[5]) put out fiscal Q4 earnings results ahead of today's open, improving over 
estimates on both top and bottom lines for the quarter. Earnings of 18 cents per share outpaced the 15 cents in the 
Zacks consensus (and vastly improved from the year-ago -$0.01 per share), for its third positive earnings surprise 
in the past four quarters. Revenues of $1.4 billion surpassed expectations on the top line by +1.23%, and beat the 
year-ago quarter by +7.7%. 
Yet inventory issues — clearing out excessive glut of merchandise by way of offering additional promotions for 
longer — is expected to hit gross margins at UnderArmour going forward. Thus, fiscal year EPS for the company 
has been lowered to 47-51 cents; the Zacks consensus had previously been for 54 cents per share. This has led 
shares to come down -5% in today's pre-market session. For more on UAA's earnings, click here. 
Also this morning, 150 new 737 MAX-10 planes have been ordered from Boeing (BA[6]) by its long-time partner 
Ryanair (RYAAY[7]) for a list price of $40.2 billion. (This is not the price Ryanair will ultimately pay for these planes; 
this would be the price you or I would be expected to pay if we were to try and buy them.) Assembly is expected to 
begin in 2024 and deliveries to begin in 2027. Both companies are up roughly +1% in pre-market trading on the 
news. 
Otherwise, early market traders are in a giving mood this morning — the Dow is -80 points at this hour, the Nasdaq 
is -70 and the S&P 500 -15 points — from yesterday's flat trading day overall. Perhaps we'll see some market 
moves on the Fed officials' take about interest rates, the debt ceiling, etc., but much more likely we'll need to wait 
for tomorrow's sub-5% (hopefully) CPI headline, year over year.

 In Spain, Repsol said it has signed an agreement with Ryanair to promote the use of renewable fuels in Spain and 
Portugal. 
With this agreement, Repsol said it will provide Ryanair with access to a maximum of 155,000 tons of SAF between 
2025 and 2030, equivalent to the fuel used on more than 28,000 flights between Dublin and Madrid, which will 
enable an approximate reduction of 490,000 tons of CO2 emissions. 
Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson said: 'SAF plays a key role in Ryanair's Pathway to Net Zero strategy and our goal of 
using 12.5% SAF by 2030. Achieving this requires multiple different feedstocks and production methods, and we're 
encouraged that Repsol are looking at different solutions. This agreement helps Ryanair secure access to 
approximately 15% of this goal. Repsol is a key sustainability partner for Ryanair, and we look forward to building 
on this collaboration as our Group grows to carry 225 million passengers annually by 2026.'

 In Spain, Repsol and Ryanair have signed a strategic agreement to promote the use of renewable fuels in Spain 
and Portugal[1]. Thanks to this alliance, both companies reinforce their role as relevant players in the 
decarbonization of the aviation industry and establish a collaboration framework for the coming years to move 
towards a sustainable air transport. 
In addition, at the end of the year, the multi-energy company will start operations at the first advanced biofuels plant 
in Spain, in Cartagena (Region of Murcia). This plant will produce 250,000 tons of renewable fuels from waste, as 
part of the company's ambition to reach a production capacity of 1.3 million tons of renewable fuels by 2025 and 
more than 2 million tons by 2030, thus leading this market in the IberianPeninsula and making decisive progress 
towards the company's goal of reaching zero net emissions by 2050.

 Opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich has been sentenced to eight years in prison. His arrest shocked the world 
when Belarus forced his Ryanair flight to land.Raman Pratasevich, the opposition journalist who was arrested after 
his Ryanair flight was forced to land in Belarus almost two years ago, was sentenced to eight years in prison on 
Wednesday. 
The 27-year-old was arrested in May 2021 after the plane he was on — flying from Greece to Lithuania — was told 
to land in Minsk as it flew over Belarus, Pratasevich's home country. The incident sparked international outrage. 
He was charged with over 1,500 crimes including organizing unrest and plotting to seize power. The blogger had 
maintained a Telegram channel, Nexta, that was used to organize the large-scale protests that broke out after the 
August 2020 elections that were widely condemned as fraudulent. 
"The Minsk regional court has sentenced Roman Protasevich to eight years in a prison colony," Belarusian state 
news agency Belta said. 
Pratasevich's outrage-sparking arrest 
Belarus grounded the Ryanair flight by declaring a false bomb alert. When the plane landed, authorities took 
Pratasevich, his girlfriend and two others. The plane then left without them. 
Pratasevich had been placed on the Belarusian secret service's terror list in November 2020. 
Two others involved in the Nexta Telegram channel, Stepan Putilo and Yan Rudnik, were also sentenced to 20 and 
19 years in prison respectively. 
Following Pratasevich's arrest in 2021, he was shown several times on Belarusian state television where he gave 
apologetic statements. He said he was "fully guilty" at the beginning of his trial in February, according to a video 
published by Belta. 
Pratasevich's confessions are believed to have been coerced. 
Belarus-EU tensions 
The arrest marked one of the high points of Belarus's crackdown on dissent following the disputed election which 
gave President Alexander Lukashenko — who has been in power since 1994 — another term in office. 
It also further stoked tensions with the EU, three members of which — Poland, Latvia and Lithuania — share a 
border with Belarus. 
The situation deteriorated amid a series of sanctions and a so-called "hybrid war" in which Belarusian authorities 
flew in migrants and sent them to cross the border into the EU. 
Belarusian journalist taken from plane sentenced to 8 years
Minsk's closeness to Moscow, upon which Lukashenko's power is entirely reliant, has further isolated the former 
Soviet republic, especially since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, using Belarus as a 
launching pad.

Belarus : Blogger Raman Pratasevich sentenced to prison

 In May 2021, Raman Pratasevich was arrested after a forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk. He publicly 
regretted his pro-opposition work but has been sentenced to prison on charges of conspiring against the state.Eight 
years in a prison colony — that is the sentence handed down to Raman Pratasevich by a court in Minsk on May 3. 
The blogger was charged with organizing riots, incitement to hatred, founding an extremist group, conspiracy to 
seize power and publicly slandering President Alexander Lukashenko. Pratasevich, who turns 28 two days after the 
verdict, was under house arrest in Belarus for almost two years. 
Pratasevich was arrested on May 23, 2021, while on a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius with his girlfriend at the 
time, Sofia Sapega. When the plane entered Belarusian airspace, controllers in Minsk warned the pilots that there 
was a bomb on board. 
A Belarusian fighter jet escorted the plane until its forced landing in Minsk — where the blogger was immediately 
detained. The International Civil Aviation Organization later determined that it was an intentional false bomb alert. 
Who is Raman Pratasevich? 
 Pratasevich was a freelance journalist in Belarus for Radio Liberty and Euroradio until 2020, followed by a position 
as editor-in-chief for the Telegram channel Nexta. Nexta had more than 2.1 million followers. It broadcast reports 
about the mass protests against Lukashenko and the rigged presidential election and police violence in August 
2020. Demonstrations were announced on Nexta, too. 
From the end of September 2020, Pratasevich directed the Belarus Golovnogo Mosga (Belarus in the Brain) 
Telegram channel. Both channels were listed as "extremist" by Belarusian authorities. Pratasevich lived in exile, 
first in Poland, then in Lithuania. 
After Pratasevich's arrest, the Belarus ONT state broadcaster aired two interviews with him. In the first, bruises and 
traces of handcuffs were visible on his wrists, and in the second, Pratasevich said he felt "great." He made 
controversial statements and mentioned the names of people who joined chats where protest actions were 
discussed — some of them were in Belarus at the time. It is unclear under what circumstances the conversations 
were recorded. Pratasevich's lawyer unsuccessfully demanded a medical examination to rule out the use of 
physical force and torture. 
'Voluntary cooperation' with investigators 
In June 2021, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry held a briefing designed to convince journalists and diplomats that 
the forced landing of the Ryanair plane was "lawful." Surprisingly, Raman Pratasevich was present for the briefing 
Belarus : Blogger Raman Pratasevich sentenced to prison
after spending weeks in a KGB investigative prison. Pratasevich told the journalists that he was cooperating 
voluntarily with the investigators, but made it clear that he did not support Lukashenko. 
Tatyana Korovenkova, a reporter for the BelaPAN non-state news agency, addressed Pratasevich: "Raman, I have 
sincere sympathy with you, as do many of your colleagues in Belarus. I can imagine what was done to you. I don't 
believe a single word you say. Hang in there." 
Interviews and a wedding under house arrest 
Despite the serious charges, Pratasevich was moved to house arrest, and had access to social networks and 
messenger services. In January 2022, he announced that he was cooperating with the so-called human rights 
center Sistemnaya Pravozashchita, an organization created by a pro-Russian activist during the migration crisis on 
the border between Belarus and the EU. 
Pratasevich gave interviews and hosted streams. He told his followers that "only the authorities in question can give 
an assessment of certain events." He said he was "an ideological fool" in the summer and fall of 2020. He criticized 
the democratic forces and called the 2020 protests a mistake. 
He said he regretted that Sofia Sapega happened to get involved, too. In May 2022, just three days after Sapega 
was sentenced to six years in prison, he announced he had married someone else. 
Hostage turns supporter of the regime? 
His trial started on February 16, 2023 in Minsk. Pratasevich was allowed to attend without handcuffs. He was not 
confined to a cage, which is unusual in Belarus. During the hearings, Pratasevich testified against his former 
colleagues, Nexta editors Stepan Putilo and Jan Rudnik, as well as against blogger Eduard Palchis and political 
scientist Valerya Kostyugova, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in March. 
In public, Pratasevich denied pressure from the Belarusian authorities. He said he regrets everything, and that his 
views have changed. Some of his statements prompted controversial reactions. 
"Many condemn Pratasevich, but I can't," says Tatyana Korovenkova, the reporter who addressed him at the 
briefing two years ago. "I will not cast stones at him because I was not in his position. I don't know how I would have 
acted myself in such a situation," she says, adding that people who have not experienced such pressure have no 
moral right to condemn him. The prison conditions for political prisoners are appalling, she says, "hard to bear for 
someone who has not spent years getting ready to fight the regime." 
"The main thing is to save yourself and get out of there as soon as possible with minimal damage to your health, 
mind and body," she argues. 
People are of two minds about Pratasevich after his "confessions" and "expressions of remorse," says Grigory 
Nizhinkov, a political scientist. He says people should not forget his current situation, arguing the blogger's public 
behavior is due to the fact that he is a hostage in Belarus. "His behavior is the strategy he has chosen. It is difficult 
to condemn him or judge him in any way. After all, everyone knows what the Belarusian regime is all about," says 
Nizhinkov.

May 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the month of April driven by upbeat air-
travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in April was 16 million. This compared 
favorably with the March figure of 12.6 million and the year-ago number of 14.2 million. 
Per a Reuters report[2], it was only the third time ever that Ryanair had carried 16 million or more passengers on its 
flights in a month. In July and August 2021, 16.8 million and 16.9 million people were transported on RYAAY flights, 
respectively. 
Owing to the upbeat traffic, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in April 
compared with 91% a year ago. Passenger volume in April was high despite the French air traffic control strikes 
that resulted in the cancellation of more than 650 flights. 
Owing to buoyant air-travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 41.6% over the past six months compared with 
the 1% uptick of the Zacks Airline[3] industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair expects to cut some flights in July and August due to delivery delays from Boeing. Zacks Rank & Key Picks 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry are Alaska Air Group ALK[4] and 
United Airlines UAL[5], each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here[6]. 
On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, Alaska Air's top line increased 31% year over year 
in the March quarter. The company expects to boost its fleet and workforce in 2023 to meet the anticipated high 
demand. ALK expects second-quarter 2023 total revenues to increase 2.5-5.5% from the second-quarter 2022 
actuals. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alaska Air's current-year earnings has been revised upward by 6.9% in the past 
60 days. 
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel 
demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. 
For 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to be in the high teens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year 
earnings has been revised upward by more than 8% in the past 60 days.

Southwest's slowing MAX deliveries

Apr 27, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Today's news[1] from Southwest Airlines generated a lot of reactions across the trade and news media to slowing 
MAX deliveries. We want to offer some context. 
Here's the big picture from January 2021. The grounding of the MAX was awful for the airline's fleet planning. 
Moreover, Southwest is focused on one aircraft type - the Boeing[2] 737. This is not unique; Ryanair is the same 
way, for example. But this choice puts the airline at risk when the OEM goes wobbly. And the MAX has seen a few 
of those. In 2023 (through today), Southwest has been getting a new MAX delivery, on average, every three days. 
That is an incredible pace and reflects how badly the airline needs these new aircraft. 
Using data from ch-Aviation, here is Southwest's current fleet. The aircraft to be delivered is 43% of the current 
fleet. Another data point to note: Over half the active fleet is the -700. This 140-seater is the core of Southwest's 
business, and that is what they need to replace. 
Among active aircraft, the -700s average 18.1 years old. This compares to 7.7 for -800s and 2.2 for the MAX. 
Besides the newer aircraft delivering better economics, they are much more fuel efficient. Older 737s have run into 
challenges with fuselage cracks[3]. It has been a while since this news has been repeated. But there was news in 
November last year cracking[4] again. We are aware that internally there is concern about the MAX7 certification 
process because the airline does not want to spend money on fixing their -700s which they cannot recoup before 
MAX7 deliveries. Many of the MAX8s being delivered should be MAX7s. 
Instead of the 100 new MAXs Southwest expected in 2023, they now expect to receive 70. This sounds rough - but 
that is still a new MAX every five days! Which is still an incredible rate. Even at a rate of 100 deliveries this year, the 
aging -700s problem would not be solved. 
So who's at fault here? Boeing owns some of this, for sure. But they don't own all of it. Southwest doubled down on 
the 737 when they could have de-risked their business[5].

Apr 18, 2023( evo: http://www.evo.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 Is the road trip making a comeback? Some of you will say it never went away. On an emotional and aspirational 
level you'd be right, but on a practical level I think we all know that the advent of cheap short-haul flights lured us 
away from our cars as the promise of quick, convenient, affordable forays into Europe became a reality. Even the 
pain of Ryanair was worth it if you could get to Milan for 20. 
Flying has never been the same since 9/11, but thanks to Covid and spiralling fuel costs, air travel is now a hateful 
process from beginning to end. Expensive tickets, understaffed airports, ridiculous three-hour check-in times, the 
joy of sitting in close proximity to several hundred mouth-breathing passengers or the spectre of cancelled flights 
are traumas we can all do without. 
This was highlighted to me when planning a short four-night stay in Switzerland to visit my in-laws. In the past, 
MrsM and I would have booked EasyJet flights to Geneva and then jumped on the train for a two-hour journey to 
Sion (the closest city to our final destination in the mountains). This time I decided to compare the cost and journey 
time of making the same trip by car. 
 > 'I can envisage a time where the best drivers are squabbling over the worst cars'[1] 
Okay, so there was an ulterior motive - I really wanted to complete a long drive in my long-term-test F-type[2] before 
it goes back to Jaguar[3]. But whereas in the past it would have been hard to justify the extra time and expense of 
driving, this time around not only was it marginally cheaper (even allowing for a Flexiplus tunnel ticket to try and 
avoid potential delays), but the call of the road felt infinitely more appealing. 
What is it about a road trip that's so pleasing? Normally I hate packing to go away, but when you're heading off in 
the car it's part of the enjoyment. Especially if you're in a car with limited luggage space. Likewise making sure the 
car is fuelled, fresh and clean inside and out the night before you leave. It's the same with an early start. Setting 
your alarm for ohmigawd o'clock is something to resent if all it does is give you a fighting chance of checking in with 
more than 30 seconds to spare, but when you're hitting the road to make good early progress at the start of a full 
day's driving I'm almost glad to hear the alarm go off. 
The 700-mile run to and from Switzerland was perfect. Almost exactly 12 hours door-to-door, including time spent 
waiting for and riding on the Eurotunnel and with two brief stops each way to fill up with fuel and grab a handful of 
road snacks. Our round-trip stats were pretty remarkable, a total of 1537 miles covered at an average speed of 
73mph and 32.2mpg. Not bad for a supercharged 5-litre 450bhp V8. 
'Driving connects you to your journey. Flying feels like an awkward stasis to be endured'
It was as effortless and enjoyable as we could have wished. I always take a few hours to really settle into a long 
drive, the kilometres dragging until something clicks and the cadence of your internal trip meter shifts from 
measuring everything in blocks of five or ten miles to 50 or even 100 miles. Having been largely confined to the UK 
for years, seeing signs pointing to destinations in France, Switzerland and Italy seemed impossibly exotic, to the 
point where it was tempting to just keep going as tendrils of wanderlust began to take hold. 
Just as it's rewarding to make such imperious progress, so there's something enormously satisfying about seeing 
the scenery slowly morph as the miles pile on. As the autoroute began to cling to the mountains and Lake Geneva 
shimmered below us, there was no way I would have traded my place for a seat on any plane. Feeling your mind 
dial out the white noise that pollutes our daily lives is deeply therapeutic and offers further proof - if any were 
needed - that driving connects you to your journey while flying feels like an awkward stasis to be endured rather 
than enjoyed. 
Given my profession, I feel embarrassed and slightly ashamed of all those times I opted to fly to places instead of 
drive. In hindsight how could it have ever been sustainable to have millions of people using airliners like buses, 
often paying less to fly to Prague than catch the Number 47 into your local town? Bluntly, just because we could 
doesn't mean we should. 
Still I'd be lying if I said some of those quick and dirty flights didn't take me on memorable trips, but the good bits 
unfailingly happened on terra firma while those hours in the air were all instantly forgettable; at best something to 
sleep through. When you drive somewhere, every mile contributes towards the overall experience and a boundless 
sense of freedom. Despite the doom-mongering and anti-car media agenda, when you put a car to good use 
(ideally one powered by an internal combustion engine) there is no better way to travel. All of which reaffirms my 
belief that if a long journey's worth doing, it's worth doing by car.

Watts Up With That?

Apr 19, 2023( Watts Up With That?: http://wattsupwiththat.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 From NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT[1] 
by Paul Homewood 
Would somebody like to tell me when anybody actually voted for any of this? 
Jetting off to the Mediterranean this summer? I hope you got a good deal, because cheap flights are becoming 
increasingly hard to find. 
You probably had an inkling that the era of absurdly cheap short-haul flights in Europe was coming to an end. After 
all, according to travel search engine Kayak, summer flights between the UK and the continent are currently one-
third more expensive than last year. But two new reports make it clear that this isn't just temporary turbulence. 
It's the new reality for flying as airlines face a huge decarbonization challenge and tightening climate-compliance 
laws 
The first headwind stems from two big changes in the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). 
Airlines must have enough emissions allowances to cover every metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the 
atmosphere on flights starting and ending in the European Economic Area, the UK and Switzerland. Right now, they 
get about half of those allowances for free. But thatdeal comes to an end in 2026[2], as the share of allowances 
they have to pay for starts to rise from 2024. That is effectively going to double their carbon costs over just three 
years. 
The unit price of carbon emissions has also soared recently, topping €100 ($111) for the first time in late February, 
and it doesn't seem to be on its way back down. A report by Alex Irving, European transport analyst at Bernstein, 
puts the resulting cost from these changes for European airlines at about €5 billion in 2027. 
That's just the thin end of the wedge. Over the next three decades, aviation has to transform itself from a polluting 
industry — planes are responsible for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions — to a net-zero one. Under Destination 2050, 
the European sector's plan to reduce emissions, it'll do that by investing in future aircraft and infrastructure, making 
operations more efficient, and using alternative fuels and carbon-removal technologies. 
Areport[3]by research groups SEO Amsterdam Economics and the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre, 
commissioned by airline industry bodies, has put the cost of reaching net zero by 2050 at a whopping €820 billion. 
The End of CheapFlights
Both reports conclude the sector won't be able to absorb these costs itself. The changes to the EU ETS alone will 
slash the operating profit of the continent's six largest point-to-point airlines (Ryanair Holdings Plc, EasyJet Plc, 
Wizz Air Holdings Plc, Vueling, Eurowings and Transavia) by an estimated 77%. That means ticket prices will have 
to be higher, which in turn means that demand destruction is inevitable. As Irving writes: 'If it were possible to 
charge more without spoiling demand, airlines would have already been doing so.' 
Demand growth is atouchy subject for airlines[4], as a recent battle over proposed flight caps between the Dutch 
government and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport illustrates. The forecasts are strong: TheInternational Air Transport 
Association suggested that passenger numbers[5]would nearly double to just under 8 billion by 2040 from 2017 
levels. Time will tell if rising ticket prices dampen that, but the question remains whether growth is even compatible 
with ambitions for carbon-neutrality. 
The answer might be hard to swallow. Decarbonizing flying is hard enough without the extra passengers. A briefing 
from the Royal Society, for example, outlined that even meeting existing UK aviation demand with biofuels would 
require about half of the country's agricultural land. 
Fewer flights is, naturally, the easiest way to slice carbon emissions, and so a demand drop would come with its 
own climate benefits. The aviation industry's report calculates that, in 2050, the drop in demand from raising prices 
to pay for sustainable airplane fuel would reduce emissions by 12%, and economic measures — such as 
emissions-trading obligations and CO2 removal investments — would lead to a further2% reduction, compared with 
a business-as-usual scenario.

Apr 14, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - April 14, 2023 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines' AAL[1], Gol Linhas 
GOL[2], Azul AZUL[3], Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5]. 
Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup: Q1 Earnings Forecasts and Expansion 
Updates In the past week, American Airlines' management gave an updated outlook for first-quarter 2023. AAL's 
results are likely to be hurt by higher costs. Latin American carriers, Gol Linhas and Azul also grabbed headlines, 
courtesy of their respective March traffic numbers. Upbeat air travel demand aided the traffic reports. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' March traffic numbers were also aided by the rise in air travel demand. 
Meanwhile, an expansion-related update was available from JetBlue Airways in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Driven by soaring demand on healthy 
bookings, AAL's management expects first-quarter 2023 TRASM to be 25.5% higher than the first-quarter 2022 
actuals. This is at the mid-point of the 24-27% uptick expected previously. AAL, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy), expects system capacity for the March-end quarter to increase 9.2% from the figure reported in first-
quarter 2022, which again is at the mid-point of the 8-10% uptick expected previously. 
Fuel cost per gallon in first-quarter 2023 is now expected to be in the $3.27-$3.32 range (earlier guidance: $3.33-
$3.38). Fuel gallon consumption is now expected to be $970 million in first-quarter 2023, higher than $955 million 
expected previously. The company continues to expect total non-operating expenses of $415 million for the March-
end quarter. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is now expected to decrease 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 
from the figure reported in first-quarter 2022 (earlier guidance: flat to down 3%). 
The adjusted operating margin in the March-end quarter is anticipated to be 3.5% (earlier guidance: 2.5-4.5%). AAL 
now expects the March-end quarter's earnings per share (excluding net special items) to be in the 1-5 cents range 
(earlier guidance called for breakeven earnings). The mid-point of the revised guidance is in line with the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank tocks here[7] 
2. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in March was an impressive 12.6 million. This compared 
favorably with the year-ago figure of 11.2 million. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 93% in March 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights American Airlines , Gol Linhas, Azul, Ryanair Holdings and JetBlue Airways
2023 compared with 87% a year ago. Ryanair expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 168 million, indicating 13% 
growth from pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
3. Driven by the improvement in air travel demand, Gol Linhas reported healthy traffic data for March. The number 
of passengers ferried on Gol flights in March registered a 22.3% year-over-year increase. The consolidated load 
factor was 82.3% in March 2023 compared with 29.5% a year ago. Load factor increased as consolidated traffic 
growth of 17.2% in the month was more than the capacity expansion (also on a consolidated basis) of 13.3%. 
Domestic departures, which accounted for more than 95% of total departures during the month, have grown 17.4% 
on a year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 17.1% in March. 
4. At Azul, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers, a measure of air traffic, showed an increase of 8.1% for 
March 2023 compared with the year-ago reported figure. The company's various codeshare agreements have 
helped increase international air traffic by 89.7% compared with the year-ago figure. A 9.4% increase in capacity 
has resulted in the load factor being at 77.8% for the reported period. 
5. JetBlue, in coordination with Massachusetts Port Authority, announced two new routes from Worcester Regional 
Airport in Massachusetts to attract additional traffic. One of these is a seasonal service from Worcester, MA, to 
Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, FL. Flights (non-stop) on this route will be operational from 
Jan 4, 2024. The other route will be operating from Worcester, MA to Orlando Sanford International Airport. Flights 
to Orlando, which stopped during the pandemic, will resume[8] operation from Jun 15. Performance Most airline 
stocks have traded in the green over the last five trading days. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 3.6% 
to $58.47, led by a double-digit gain at Gol Linhas. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has gained 12.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for first-quarter 2023 earnings reports of

Apr 13, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, American Airlines' AAL[1] management gave an updated outlook for first-quarter 2023. AAL's 
results are likely to be hurt by higher costs. Latin American carriers, Gol Linhas GOL[2] and Azul AZUL[3] also 
grabbed headlines, courtesy of their respective March traffic numbers. Upbeat air travel demand aided the traffic 
reports. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] March traffic numbers were also aided by the rise in air travel 
demand. Meanwhile, an expansion-related update was availablefrom JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Driven by soaring demand on healthy 
bookings, AAL's management expects first-quarter 2023 TRASM to be 25.5% higher than the first-quarter 2022 
actuals. This is at the mid-point of the 24-27% uptick expected previously. AAL, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy), expects system capacity for the March-end quarter to increase 9.2% from the figure reported in first-
quarter 2022, which again is at the mid-point of the 8-10% uptick expected previously. 
Fuel cost per gallon in first-quarter 2023 is now expected to be in the $3.27-$3.32 range (earlier guidance: $3.33-
$3.38). Fuel gallon consumption is now expected to be $970 million in first-quarter 2023, higher than $955 million 
expected previously. The company continues to expect total non-operating expenses of $415 million for the March-
end quarter. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is now expected to decrease 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 
from the figure reported in first-quarter 2022 (earlier guidance: flat to down 3%). The adjusted operating margin in 
the March-end quarter is anticipated to be 3.5% (earlier guidance: 2.5-4.5%). AAL now expects the March-end 
quarter's earnings per share (excluding net special items) to be in the 1-5 cents range (earlier guidance called for 
breakeven earnings). The mid-point of the revised guidance is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 
cents. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank tocks here[7] 
2. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in March was an impressive 12.6 million. This compared 
favorably with the year-ago figure of 11.2 million. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 93% in March 
2023 compared with 87% a year ago. Ryanair expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 168 million, indicating 13% 
growth from pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
3. Driven by the improvement in air travel demand, Gol Linhas reported healthy traffic data for March. The number 
of passengers ferried on Gol flights in March registered a 22.3% year-over-year increase. The consolidated load 
Airline Stock Roundup: AAL 's Revised Q1 Forecast, JBLU 's Expansion Update & More
factor was 82.3% in March 2023 compared with 29.5% a year ago. Load factor increased as consolidated traffic 
growth of 17.2% in the month was more than the capacity expansion (also on a consolidated basis) of 13.3%. 
Domestic departures, which accounted for more than 95% of total departures during the month, have grown 17.4% 
on a year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 17.1% in March. 
4. At Azul, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers, a measure of air traffic, showed an increase of 8.1% for 
March 2023 compared with the year-ago reported figure. The company's various codeshare agreements have 
helped increase international air traffic by 89.7% compared with the year-ago figure. A 9.4% increase in capacity 
has resulted in the load factor being at 77.8% for the reported period. 
5. JetBlue, in coordination with Massachusetts Port Authority, announced two new routes from Worcester Regional 
Airport in Massachusetts to attract additional traffic. One of these is a seasonal service from Worcester, MA, to 
Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, FL. Flights (non-stop) on this route will be operational from 
Jan 4, 2024. The other route will be operating from Worcester, MA to Orlando Sanford International Airport. Flights 
to Orlando, which stopped during the pandemic, will resume[8] operation from Jun 15. Performance The following 
table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the last five trading days. The NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index has increased 3.6% to $58.47, led by a double-digit gain at Gol Linhas. Over the course of the 
past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 12.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for 
first-quarter 2023 earnings reports of various airlines. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

 In the Netherlands, Neste and Ryanair have expanded their collaboration to enable Ryanair to power its full 
schedule of flights from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol with a 40% blend of Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel from 
April 1 onwards[1]. 
This significant increase in SAF usage represents the latest milestone towards Ryanair's ambitious goal of 
operating 12.5% of flights with SAF by 2030 and further supports Ryanair's 'Pathway to Net Zero by 2050' 
decarbonisation goals, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Ryanair's flights from the Amsterdam Airport by 
32%.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is benefiting from buoyant air-travel demand (particularly on the leisure front). The 
company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
However, escalated fuel costs are limiting the bottom-line growth. Factors Favoring RYAAY The gradual 
improvement in air-travel demand is a huge boon for Ryanair. Owing to this tailwind, the company reported healthy 
traffic data for March. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in March was an impressive 12.6 million. 
This compared favorably with the year-ago figure of 11.2 million. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 93% in March 2023 compared with 87% a year ago. Ryanair 
expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 168 million, indicating 13% growth from the pre-COVID-19 traffic numbers. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. The 
company's efforts to bring down its debt levels are commendable as well. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.96 
billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2022. Key Risks Rising fuel prices thanks to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war pose a threat to 
Ryanair's bottom line. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more than 200% year over year in the first 
half of fiscal 2023 due to a rise in sectors flown and high jet fuel prices. Fuel costs increased 52% in the fiscal third 
quarter. 
Apart from higher fuel prices, the ramp-up in the airline's operations is pushing up total costs. Operating costs were 
up 36% in the fiscal third quarter. Labor-related tensions also do not bode well. Stocks to Consider Some better-
ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation [2]sector are Copa Holdings CPA[3] and GATX Corporation GATX[4]. 
Copa Holdings' focus on its cargo segment is very encouraging. In fourth-quarter 2022, cargo and mail revenues 
jumped 69% to $27.09 million, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Currently, CPA sports a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[5] 
For first-quarter and full-year 2023, CPA's earnings are expected to register 485% and 40.5% growth, respectively, 
on a year-over-year basis. 
GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. The gradual improvement in the North American railcar leasing 
market is a huge positive for the company. Management expects a recovery in the North American railcar leasing 
market to continue in 2023. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Rides on Buoyant Air Traffic Despite Cost Woes
We are also impressed by GATX's measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks despite 
the economic uncertainty. For full-year 2023, its earnings are expected to register 10.5% growth on a year-over-
year basis. 
 Infrastructure Stock Boom to Sweep America

 European airlines are concerned that Europe is losing its advantage over the United States when it comes to the 
production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and e-fuels, which are produced from green electricity and hydrogen. 
The concerns were voiced by airline associationAirlines 4 Europe[1] (A4E) during its Aviation Summit in Brussels on 
Wednesday. A4E concerned that Europe loses out on sustainable fuels. 
Since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of the Biden Administration was passed, this is already resulting in energy 
companies postponing investments in European facilities or moving them to the US, where they can benefit from 
incentives. The European Commission has responded to IRA with its own Net Zero Industry Act, but A4E member 
airlines want Europe to move away from the current mandate policy that is part of theFit for 55 program[2] to 
incentive schemes that are working very well in the US. 
'The US may be a little behind Europe when it comes to promoting SAF, but their system of incentives is starting to 
become very effective. They create tax advantages for users and buyers to use these fuels and increase the 
production volumes of these fuels in order to decarbonize our industry. That's something we are missing in Europe, 
we are missing any support in this regard,' said Carsten Spohr, outgoing Chair of A4E. 'Europe, through mandates, 
is forcing us to buy non-existing volumes of SAF at crazy prices that are five times higher than kerosene. () 
Governments, airlines, our industry but also society need to show commitment to the investments to scale up SAFs 
and bring down the price quickly because there is already a race going on about where these investments are going 
to build up volumes.' 
Spohr warned that Europe could be losing its advantage. 'We already lost the race on batteries, we lost the race on 
solar panels. We now also risk losing the race for synthetic fuels, which once again shows that Europe is not 
competing where it should be.' A4E voiced its concerns not just during the press conference on Wednesday, but 
also the previous day when Commissioner Frans Timmermans was invited to the CEO table. 
'We ask the question: where are those billions of environmental taxes going? We as an industry accept to pay those 
taxes, but we rightfully ask the question what the hell has happened with them? Europe should at least subsidize or 
incentivize the rapid production of SAF,' Group CEO Michael O'Leary of Ryanair said. 
Same concerns 
During the Summit, A4E called on the European Union and policymakers to strengthen and secure the 
competitiveness of European aviation. The airlines note that essential reforms have stalled for a number of years on 
A4E concerned that Europe loses out on sustainable fuels
key topics like the airport charges directive, taxes, the reform of passenger rights under the EU261 rule, and the 
Single European Sky[3] (SES). 
Aspointed out here[4] by AirInsight already in 2021, the problem is that the airlines and A4E have not had any 
success in pushing these points, which have been on the agenda of each A4E Aviation Summit for the past seven 
years now. It made moderator Richard Quest of the CEO panel wonder why the lobby of A4E with the European 
Commission has not been effective and if it shouldn't start getting tough and make a strong message to politicians 
and the public. 
Carsten Spohr said: 'I agree with you, but I pointed out already this morning that there is a new currency in town: 
CO2. Historically, we as airlines complain about money and passenger comfort, which, obviously, didn't get very 
far. But now it is different. This important thing about CO2 will change the debate. But I agree we have privately to 
be tough with politicians for revoking ideas that are expensive.' 
The problem with the reforms, notably those on air space, is that national governments are unwilling to take action 
and the European Commission fails to have the power to impose an EU-wide policy. Spohr agreed: 'Where is their 
power, really? Is it just a question of willingness? The fact is that if Germany or France because of the pressure of 
the unions doesn't agree to do it, any Commissioner in the world can try but will be unsuccessful. It is nave to think 
that someone in Brussels wakes up in the morning and takes up the phone to call Paris or Berlin and tell them 'the 
Single European Sky will happen.' 
'The Commission has to drive it true, the Commission is a transnational body. The problem is we have a 
Commission that doesn't want to take action,' added O'Leary. He referred to the Commission's failure to address 
the problem of the closure of French air space for overflying traffic during the multiple strikes in recent weeks and 
days, which are set to continue in April. Ryanair has launched a petition[5] to get the flying public behind it and force 
Brussels to act. 'Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen was given a roadmap by Eurocontrol three months ago to 
prioritize overflights, but she didn't do anything. They need to take action!' 
A4E discusses its concerns and worries twice a year but has to conclude that each time little or no progress has 
been made. 'As long as it is necessary, we will tell the Commission the same thing,' O'Leary said. Spohr added: 
'This conference today is more than just pressing the EU Commission. It is the reflection event of European 
aviation, which is one of the few industries where Europe is still trading on a par with other parts of the world.'  
easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said: 'We need to be crystal sharp on the narrative and message and there is a new 
currency. There is something about the carbon saving and sustainability agenda that we can get some wins from. I 
am talking about the air space reforms. We can be better at bringing that story and also make it clear to the public 
and consumers. It becomes technical when you talk about the air space reform, but you have to make sure that 
people understand that we could reduce emissions by ten percent but can't because we can't fly in an optimum 
way.'

 Ryanair [1]is in no hurry to sign a new order for more Boeing MAX aircraft. The airline and airframer are back at the 
negotiation table, but Group CEO Michael O'Leary said on the sidelines of the Airline ls 4 Europe Aviation Summit 
in Brussels on Wednesday that it could take six months to a year before an order could be signed. 
The Irish low-cost carrier walked away from negotiations after it found Boeing unwilling to discuss a significant 
discount. For months, nothing happened. Last week, The Financial Times reported that negotiations are on again. 
'They approached us some two months ago, we started those discussions. We are still at the possibility for an order 
for the MAX 8200 or the MAX 10. It could be either, I am agnostic,' O'Leary told AirInsight. 
He added: 'I would like to have more -8200s, because that's what we have. But if they want us to buy a bigger 
aircraft with thirty extra seats, I want a discount for those seats because if I fill the volume of those extra seats 
lowers my yields.' 
It seems illogical that Boeing[2] would lower the price now that the MAX has won several orders over the past 
months, including from Qatar Airways, Alaska, WestJet, United, and Japan Airlines last week, plus a few smaller 
ones. 'There is no doubt that Airbus[3] is selling more. I suspect that Boeing had so many delivery problems with 
the MAX and 787 that now that they are getting out of the way, they are back on the sales path again.' 
'I am not under any particular pressure to sign a deal. We are getting fifty aircraft in the summer of 2023, fifty in 
2024, and thirty in 2025. But I do recognize we do need more aircraft in 2026 through 2030. I have to retire some 
older aircraft, and at the same time, I want to grow.'

 Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] is benefiting from the improvement in traffic from the pandemic-led slump. 
Measures to expand its fleet and bring down debt levels are encouraging too. 
Against this backdrop, let's look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick. What Makes RYAAY an 
Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an 
impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. Shares of RYAAY have gained 38.7% over the past six 
months compared with the 6% rise of the industry[2] it belongs to.

Solid Zacks Rank: RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank 
#1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company is a compelling investment proposition at 
the moment. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[3] 
Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to 
the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's 2023 and 2024 earnings 
has moved up 20.8% and 15.6%, year over year, respectively. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: RYAAY has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an 
earnings surprise of 7.51% in the last four quarters, on average. 
Earnings Expectations: Earnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company's prospects. For 2023 and 
2024, RYAAY's earnings are expected to grow more than 100% and 1.93% year over year, respectively. 
Growth Factors: An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. In February 
2023, RYAAY flew 10.6 million passengers, higher than the 8.7 million flown a year ago. The load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) was 92% in February 2023 compared with 86% a year ago. 
Ryanair now aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 168 million, indicating 13% growth from the pre-COVID 
traffic numbers. The prior view was 165 million. Riding on the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY lifted its forecast for 
fiscal 2023 profitability. 
Measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. In fiscal 2022, the 
airline took delivery of 61 B737-8200 jets. It expects to have more than 70 of these jets in its fleet for the peak 
summer season. The remaining jets are expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2025. Efforts to bring down 
debt levels are encouraging too. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader

Ryanair has had enough of continuous French ATC strikes

 Irish low-cost airlineRyanair[1] is trying to get one million people to sign a petition to force the European 
Commission to take action against France and the countless strikes at air traffic control (ATC). The airline is fed up 
with the strikes, which are seriously disrupting air travel across Europe. Even today, French ATC is on strike to 
protest the pension reforms that have been imposed by President Macron. Ryanair has had enough of continuous 
French ATC strikes. 
Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said at a media conference in Brussels that this year, French ATC strikes have 
disrupted air travel for thirteen days in the last eight weeks. Another four have been announced for this week, 
including the one today. 'In thirteen days of ATC strikes, over a million of our passengers have been affected 
unnecessarily, 300 Ryanair flights had to be canceled and another 6.000 suffered delays, much to the frustration of 
our customers.' 
The problem is that the French strike affects overflying traffic, while domestic flights are protected and can continue. 
'Overflights are allowed in many other countries, but not in France. So while we are bearing the consequences of 
the strike in Dublin, Berlin, Madrid, or wherever, French flights are protected. That's outrageous and the European 
Commission needs to do something about it,' said Wilson. 
Eighty percent of the flights that are affected by strikes are flights crossing France. Hit the hardest in the past eight 
weeks were those to Spain, with 1.750 flights and 320.000 passengers. The UK is next with 700 flights and 120.000 
passengers, with Italy in third place with 600 flights and 115.000 affected customers. When not canceled, flights 
had to make long detours to circumvent French airspace instead of taking the direct and shorter route. This has 
cost 1.1 million kilograms in extra fuel and resulted in 4.000 tonnes in carbon dioxide emissions. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-20-1.png?ssl=1 
'If they are on strike in France over pension reforms, why should that affect people in Germany, Italy or Spain? 
They have the right to strike, but not the right to needlessly disrupt people's business or holidays. This denies 
people the freedom of movement, one of the four freedoms within the European Union, but the Commission has 
done nothing about this. If this was happening at ports or roads, it would be sorted out straight away,' Wilson 
said.Punctuality in Europe[2] already suffered in 2022 because of airline, airport, and ATC disruptions. 
What annoys Ryanair the most is that the French way of striking is different from the rest of Europe. 'The Spanish, 
Italians, and Greek agreed that when their ATC goes on strike, they allow overflying traffic to continue. That 
Ryanair has had enough of continuous French ATC strikes
happened in Greece last Friday and it can be done in France too. We need Eurocontrol to manage ATC when the 
French go on strike. It is important that France mandates overflights so Eurocontrol can take over, and a mandate 
for arbitration instead of going on strike.' Director of Operations Neal McMahon said that in September, only nine 
ATC staff went on strike but caused chaos across the European system. 
Instead of having lobby organization Airlines 4 Europe running a campaign, Ryanair calls upon the flying public to 
protest against the problem, although Wilson said that other airlines are welcome to join. 'easyJet is affected, all the 
Spanish airlines flying North are affected.' Once one million people have signed the 'Keep EU skies open'-petition, 
Ryanair intends to present the signatures to Ursula von der Leyen, Chair of the European Commission. 
'We have been calling on Von der Leyen for many months now but nothing has happened. Now we are facing a 
summer of chaos just because of a local dispute about the retirement age. I would love to bring the French air traffic 
controllers of President Von der Leyen to the middle of an airport where there are 20.000 people, sitting around on 
the floors because they can't take off from a country unrelated to what is happening in France.'

 Airlines including Wizz Air and Ryanair owe millions of pounds to passengers from unpaid refunds and expenses, 
according to an investigation by the consumer group Which?. 
It called on the government and regulators to take urgent action over the 4.5m it calculates carriers owe in county 
court judgments (CCJs), describing the current enforcement of air passenger protections as 'fundamentally flawed'. 
Which? criticised 'weak regulations' and a 'dysfunctional dispute resolution system' for failing to help passengers 
enforce their rights. 
Consumers can pursue payments through county courts if they believe that an airline has failed to meet their legal 
obligations. CCJs can then be issued to the company requiring them to pay the passenger. 
Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'The scale of court judgments piling up against major 
airlines is a result of a system where the odds are stacked against passengers and airlines feel empowered to 
routinely ignore their legal obligations to pay out refunds and compensation.' 
Wizz Air accounts for almost half of the total amount owed, according to the consumer group's analysis of the 
Registry Trust, a log of court documents and fines in England and Wales. 
In December, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) raised 'significant concerns' with Wizz Air over its high numbers of 
complaints and delays in paying passengers what they are owed. The airline blamed the 'unprecedented level of 
disruption' during the pandemic and said it was 'putting measures in place to ensure we are better prepared, 
including more customer services resources and revised processes'. 
It has settled more than 400 CCJs since December, it said, adding that the outstanding cases were mostly related 
to not receiving judgments from courts 'due to problems receiving post'. 
A spokesperson said: 'Online registers do not provide us with the information required to settle a case. We must, 
therefore, write to individual courts to apply for information about each case when we are made aware of it, and 
then wait to receive that information. This all makes for a complicated and time-consuming process. 
'We are taking this matter extremely seriously, doing all we can to fix these issues and settle all outstanding cases 
as quickly as possible. Customers can contact us directly using our website or app to provide information about an 
outstanding judgment.' 
Which? called on the CAA to be more 'transparent about its enforcement activities'. 
UK passengers owed millions by airlines in unpaid refunds and expenses
Anna Bowles, head of consumer policy and enforcement at the CAA, said: 'Airline passengers should rightfully 
expect to be treated fairly by airlines, and to have their complaints and claims resolved in a quick and efficient 
manner. 
'We're already reviewing Wizz Air's performance and have expressed significant concern with them over high 
volumes of complaints and delays in paying passengers what they are owed, and made clear that it is not providing 
an acceptable level of service.' 
She added: 'Our latest data on airline complaints will be published shortly, along with any further steps we plan to 
take if service has not improved.' 
The Registry Trust dataset shows that Ryanair has 840 outstanding CCJs, totalling 549,892, and Tui Airways has 
yet to settle 313 CCJs, worth 1.26m. British Airways has 82 outstanding CCJs adding up to 96,042 while Jet2 has 
four, totalling 1,434. 
EasyJet owes 611,436 on 884 outstanding CCJs while Tui Airways owes 1.26m, on 313 CCJs, according to the 
data. EasyJet told Which? it had paid the money but the register has not been updated. 
A Tui spokesperson also said the figures listed were not necessarily still owed. 'In most cases it is indicative only of 
the record not having been updated to show payment,' they said. 'Tui Airways will be taking steps to address the 
record.' 
The airlines are members of the AviationADR resolution scheme, except for BA, which is a member of the Centre 
for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), and Jet2, which is not signed up to a scheme. 
A spokesperson for the CEDR said: 'We take our duty to provide independent and impartial ADR to consumers and 
companies alike very seriously.' 
AviationADR, Ryanair, Jet2 and BA were approached for comment.

 Sam Jones, the founder of Gener8, a London based company that lets people take back control and earn from 
their online data, has launched a mobile app that allows people to see what data a company holds on them, then 
gives them the choice to earn from it themselves. 
In academia and government there has been a concept called PIMS (personal information management systems). 
This is essentially the idea that in the future there will be systems created that enable people to centralise their data 
into one location. Gener8 is now doing that today. 
Gener8's founder, Sam Jones, commented: 'We believe Gener8 is the first company in the world to enable people 
to centralise their data into one location and earn from it. We've built something that, until now, has only been 
theoretical in the world of academia. Think about it. Isn't it crazy that we don't even know which companies buy and 
sell our data?' 
'In fact, we don't even know what data company's hold on us. What do Facebook and Google know about you? 
Why do spam emails keep landing in your inbox? Well, with the Gener8 app you can connect to different apps and 
we'll show the data that these apps hold on you. 
'So, if for example you connect to Google, we can show you all the data that Google holds on you - every search 
you've ever made, every YouTube video you've watched, every ad that you've clicked on. It's mind boggling. We 
can then enable you to delete this data from Google. Or should you choose, you can anonymise your data and can 
earn from it.' 
Gener8 has also closed a 5.1m funding round. The investment values the company at 30m. A consortium of 
investors participated in the round, including ex-cricket captain of the West Indies, Chris Gayle, former chief 
executive of the British Olympic Association, Simon Clegg CBE and Shane Ryan, son of RyanAir founder, Tony 
Ryan. 
They join musician Tinie Tempah, football manager Harry Redknapp, and Dragons' Den stars Peter Jones, Touker 
Suleyman and Tej Lalvani who have also invested in the company. 
Sam said: 'It's been a crazy 18 months, and what a way to kick off 2023! We're building technology at Gener8 that 
has the ability to change an industry. It's mad that so many companies are making money from our data, except us! 
This has to change. 
London based data platform surpasses 5m investment via Dragons' Den stars and more
'I believe that in the same way we trust banks to keep our money safe and put it to work for us, there will be 
companies that we put our faith in to keep our data safe and even help us earn from it. Gener8 is creating this 
future. 
'As part of this fundraise we've brought onboard some fantastic investors with a wealth of expertise. I'm looking 
forward to working with them as we grow the business and execute on our mission.'

Mar 07, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is being affected by high fuel costs. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by 
more than 50% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022). Also, a ramp-up in RYAAY's 
operations is pushing up total costs. 
Total operating expenses rose more than 35% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023, with a substantial 
increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. Labor-related woes are also hurting operations at 
Ryanair. 
Total operating expenses rose more than 35% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023, with a substantial 
increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. Labor-related woes are also hurting operations at 
Ryanair. 
However, a rebound in air-travel demand following the easing of COVID-related restrictions is a huge boon for 
Ryanair. On the back of buoyant traffic scenario in the Christmas/New Year period, RYAAY's profit after tax in third-
quarter fiscal 2023 was €211 million against a net loss of €96 million incurred a year ago. 
Continuing the trend, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in February registered an impressive 
figure of 10.6 million. This compared favorably with the year-ago figure of 8.7 million. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 92% in February 2023 compared with 86% a year ago. Ryanair 
expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the pre-COVID-19 traffic numbers. 
Below we present the fourth-quarter 2022 results of some other Zacks Airline[2] industry stocks that too benefited 
from buoyant air traffic. 
Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, operating revenues at American Airlines AAL[3] in fourth-quarter 2022 
increased 39.3% year over year. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected by the total operating revenue increase 
of 16.6% from the fourth-quarter 2019 (pre- COVID-19) levels despite 6.1% lower capacity. 
In the December quarter, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (92%), increased to $12,131 
million from $8,382 million a year ago, driven by strong air-travel demand, mainly on the domestic front. Driven by 
soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total unit revenues in the first quarter of 2023 to be 
roughly 24-27% higher than the level recorded in first-quarter 2022. 
Bullish Air Traffic Cushions Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Against Cost Woes
Owing to buoyant air-travel demand, United Airlines UAL[4] posted a significant year over year increase (about 
51.37%) in fourth-quarter 2022 revenues. The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by 62.9% 
rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 90.3% of the top line) to $11,202 million. 
Moreover, passenger revenues increased 12.8% from fourth-quarter 2019 reading. Nearly 39 million passengers 
traveled on UAL flights in the December quarter. 
Driven by solid demand, UAL's management expects total revenue per available seat mile to grow almost 25% year 
over year for the first quarter of 2023. Total revenues are anticipated to grow almost 50% year over year. United 
Airlines expects first-quarter 2023 earnings per share in the $0.5-$1.00 band.

Mar 07, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - March 7, 2023 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights United 
Airlines UAL[1], American Airlines AAL[2], Southwest Airlines LUV[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Copa 
Airlines CPA[5]. Breaking Down 3 Airline Segments (Avoid 1)The Resurgence of Air Travel Since the COVID-19 
fallout in 2020, airlines have been on the runway to recovery. In 2022, air traffic numbers finally recovered fully to 
2019 pre-pandemic numbers, according to the FAA. Thus far in March, TSA checkpoint numbers are showing 2023 
not only surpassing 2022, but also taking out 2019 numbers. As more employees enjoy flexible remote work, 
business travel recovers, and vacationers make up for lost time, the airline industry's turbulent times may be in the 
rearview mirror, and years of growth may be ahead. With that said, not all airlines are created equally. Today, we 
will break down three segments of the airline industry: Large Domestic Carriers In January, Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) 
United Airlines handily beat earnings estimates. Zacks Consensus Estimates expected EPS of 2.07, and UAL 
delivered EPS of $2.46. 
UAL's revenue also jumped by a healthy 51% as air traffic picked up. UAL's healthy top-line growth can also be 
attributed to its fast growing cargo operations business. Cargo revenues increased an impressive 84.1% in 2022 
versus pre pandemic levels. 
Judging by UAL's historical earnings price and earnings relationship, the stock has a lot left in the tank. If UAL's 
earnings trajectory follows consensus estimates for the next year, a conservative price target would be $80 a share 
by year-end based on the chart below: 
Fellow Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock American Airlines is on a similar growth path as United. Like United, American 
Airlines benefits from the continued recovery in air travel demand, a growing offering of travel destinations, and 
management's debt reduction efforts. However, from an estimate perspective, UAL remains the most attractive 
name in this segment. Small Domestic Carriers Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Southwest Airlines has been 
drastically underperforming its peers. While United Airlines is up 70% over the past year, Southwest's stock is lower 
by 8%. 
Southwest's performance has been negatively impacted by rising fuel costs, massive flight cancellations, and a rise 
in labor costs (and a labor dispute). These issues have led to a return on equity (ROE) of just 6.7% - well below that 
Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: United Airlines , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines , Ryanair 
and Copa Airlines
of the S&P 500 Index and a signal that the company is poorly managed and inefficient. While the larger carriers 
have to contend with these same issues, the impact is being felt more by the smaller carriers. Small Foreign 
Carriers Thus far in 2023, foreign carriers such as Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Ryanair Holdings have 
outperformed. Ryanair, known for its cheap flights around Europe, is experiencing robust demand. Despite the 
strong price action in the stock, management does not seem content. RYAAY is purchasing more than 200 
BoeingMax jets to expand its fleet. Shares of RYAAY are attempting to break out over $100. If the stock can clear 
the psychologically important level, it opens the door to $120 by year end. 
Perhaps no other airline has handled the many challenges thrown at the industry as well as Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy) Copa Airlines. For example, while most airlines were unprofitable in 2020 and 2021 after the pandemic shock, 
Copa was back in the green by 2021. While rising fuel costs remain a headwind, CPA's prudent cost-management 
efforts are paying off. In the most recent reported quarter, passenger servicing and maintenance costs each 
dropped by more than 20%. CPA shares continue to ride the rising 50-day moving average and are set to move 
higher. Takeaway The Zacks Transportation - Airline Industry is one of the strongest industries tracked by Zacks. 
The strength in airlines can be attributed to a resurgence in air traffic which is driving earnings higher. Because the 
industry is in the top 26% of all industries, investors should expect airlines to outperform over the next 12 months. 
However, not all airline stocks deserve your attention. Stick to large U.S.-based carriers or smaller foreign carriers 
as opposed to small domestic carriers, which are feeling the impact of rising fuel costs. Why Haven't You Looked at 
Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per 
year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access

 Turkish Airlines[1] surprised with a $2.7 billion net profit for 2022, one of the highest seen within the industry so far 
and not even matched by the three US carriers. The carrier is citing strong revenue development that saw last year 
outpace 2019 at every level. 
The net profit of $2.725 billion compares to $959 million in 2021[2]. Revenues grew to $18.246 billion from $10.686 
billion, of which $14.291 was from passengers and $3.735 billion came from cargo. It carried 71.8 million 
passengers with a domestic load factor of 85.8 percent and an international load factor of 80.1 percent. 
Expenses increased to $15.710 billion from $9.411 billion in the previous year. The fuel bill hit $6.467 billion, up 
from $2.756 billion as it was hedged for 36 percent. EBITDAR was $5.377 billion (2021: $3.744 billion), and the 
operating profit was $3.193 billion ($1.689 billion). Net debt stood at $9.124 billion. 
'In spite of the inflation pressures on the global scale, the flag carrier maintained its effective cost management in 
2022 by lowering its unit expenses excluding fuel by two percent compared to 2019. As a result, EBITAR, which 
demonstrates the cash generation potential of the company, realized as $5.4 billion,' the airline says in a media 
statement. 
Unit revenues  
Passenger unit revenues were back in the green for all geographic regions to on average $7.08 from $5.00 in 2021. 
Those to Europe were the highest ahead of the Middle East and Africa. Those to the Far East were even higher 
than to the Americas, despite capacity in available seat kilometers being 16.5 percent down to Asia compared to 
2019 whereas the capacity to the Americas was up 65.1 percent. 
Turkish Airlines likes to compare its 2022 results with those of 2019, the last year before the Covid-crisis. Back 
then, the net profit was $788 million, total revenues $13.229 billion, expenses $10.928 billion, EBITDAR $3.107 
billion, and the operating profit $1.047 billion. Passenger revenues were up 28 percent, and cargo revenues by 121 
percent. 
The fourth quarter paints another picture. Turkish reported a $473 million net profit, which is more than double that 
of the same quarter in 2021 but down on the $1.515 billion produced in Q3[3]. Revenues totaled $4.772 billion in 
Q4 2022, $3.309 billion the year before, and $6.068 billion in Q3. The operating profit of $615 million compares to 
$554 million in Q 2021 and to $1.437 billion in Q3. 
Market share 
Turkish Airlines surprises with $2.7 billion profit
Turkish notes that together with Ryanair and Qatar Airways, it is one of the few airlines that has consistently grown 
global market share over the past decade. It now stands at 2.7 percent, up 1.7 percent since 2010 and on par with 
Qatar. While American Airlines sets the benchmark at 4.9 percent, Turkish says it has some big names in the 
rearview mirror like Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, and British Airways. Subsidiary AnadoluJet has also grown its 
market share, from 13.3 percent in 2019 to 64.5 percent last year. Market share in cargo has quadrupled in the last 
ten years. 
Turkish Airlines ended 2022 with a fleet of 394 aircraft, up twenty year on year. It took delivery of thirteen Airbus 
A321neo's and three A320neo's, six (ex-Aeroflot) A350-900s, eight Boeing MAX 8s, and one 787-9. AnadoluJet's 
fleet stood at 64. The airline will take fifteen new aircraft in 2023. Turkish has contracts for eighty aircraft to be 
delivered this year through 2028 plus five options. 
The presentation was overshadowed by the grief for the victims of the devastating earthquakes that hit the East of 
Turkey on February 6. Since then, Turkish has flown over 2.400 flights to ferry rescue workers and materials to the 
affected area.

 A former boyfriend of Ruja Ignatova, the mastermind of the Ponzi scheme Onecoin, has received five years in 
prison. The sentence is for the laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of proceeds from the notorious 
crypto scam which defrauded investors around the world. 
Ruja's Former Boyfriend Sentenced for Money Laundering Linked to Onecoin 
Gilbert Armenta, the ex-boyfriend of crypto pyramid Onecoin's founder Ruja Ignatova, has been sentenced in the 
United States, Bloomberg Law reported[1]. According to court documents, he helped launder $300 million of 
proceeds from one of the largest Ponzi schemes in crypto history. 
In 2018, Armenta[2], now 59, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud, money laundering and extortion, all 
in connection with Onecoin. He cooperated with prosecutors in the investigation into the scam for about two years 
but later committed other crimes, violating the agreement. 
Founded in 2014, Onecoin operated as a global multi-level-marketing network, which was based on a 
cryptocurrency that never really existed as such, despite being advertised as the 'Bitcoin[3] killer.' According to 
Onecoin's own documents, more than 3 million people invested over $4 billion in Onecoin since 2016. 
Bulgarian-born German national Ruja Ignatova[4] disappeared in October 2017, when she boarded a Ryanair flight 
in Sofia bound for Athens. Still, at large[5], she is wanted by Interpol, Europol[6], and the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI[7]). 
Her brother and co-founder, Konstantin, who was detained in Los Angeles in 2019, pleaded guilty to charges 
related to Onecoin and sought witness protection in the U.S. In December 2022, another co-founder, British and 
Swedish citizen Karl Sebastian Greenwood, also pleaded guilty[8] to his part in the scam. 
Crypto Pyramid Mastermind Ruja Ignatova Still Missing 
Information about Ignatova's whereabouts and activities has periodically surfaced in media reports. Last July, the 
leading Greek daily Kathimerini unveiled[5] that the Hellenic Police had tried to locate and arrest her, acting on 
intelligence indicating she was in the country and holding meetings with unidentified persons. 
In January of this year, British media uncovered that a $15-million apartment bought by the 'missing Cryptoqueen' 
through a company based on the island of Guernsey had been offered for sale. A BBC report on the matter 
revealed[9] that the Kensington penthouse had been listed with the approval of authorities in Germany. 
Onecoin Cryptoqueen's Ex-boyfriend Gets 5 Years in Prison
Prosecutors in the city of Bielefeld have accused a German lawyer who worked for Ignatova, Martin Breidenbach, of 
money laundering for the transfer of €20 million (over $21 million) for the purchase of the four-bedroom apartment. 
In October, he appeared[10] in court, along with two Onecoin associates, to face charges of fraud and other crimes. 
Do you think law enforcement authorities will eventually find Onecoin's founder Ruja Ignatova? Share your thoughts 
on the case in the comments section below.

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - February 8, 2023 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights United 
Airlines UAL[1], Copa Holdings CPA[2], American Airlines AAL[3], Ryanair RYAAY[4] and Delta DAL[5]. 5 Reasons 
Airlines Are Set for a Turbulence-Free 2023Turbulent Times for Airlines It turns out that transporting thousands of 
passengers around the world in a metal tube is no easy task. The airline industry is one of the most complicated 
industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have inputs and outputs, the sum of which 
ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines have had to contend with the 
following: 
 A Global Pandemic: Shrank demand to nearly zero and decreased the number of employees. 
 Complex Geopolitical Circumstances: The War in Ukraine drove crude oil prices to near triple digits before pulling 
back last year. 
 Lack of Skilled Employees: Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the 
pandemic. 
 Outdated Airplanes: Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturersled to a 
lack of airplanes. 
Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life. Clear Skies Ahead? 
Below I will lay out 5 reasons why the tough times experienced by airlines in recent years may finally be over: 
1. A Return to Profitability: International airlines survived massive losses during the pandemic and are now back to 
earning healthy profits. For example, United Airlines lost $28 per share in 2020. In 2022, UAL made $2.50 per 
share. 
Panamanian airline Copa Holdings and other international airlines show a similar EPS trajectory. 
2. Rising EPS Estimates: Airline providers such as American Airlines, Ryanair and United have rising consensus 
estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting 
that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. Delta is one of the few airline stocks 
with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster quarter where EPS rocketed 573%. 
Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: United Airlines , Copa , American Airlines , Ryanair and Delta
4. Recovery to Pre-pandemic Levels: Recently, Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun confirmed his aspirations to return to 
pre-pandemic aircraft production levels. Airline giants like United are planning to hire thousands of pilots in 2023 to 
increase staff - with no training capacity constraints. Meanwhile, air travel occupancy levels have recovered fully. 
5. Drastically Improving Technical Picture:  
Uptrend Resumed: After five failed attempts to re-take the 200-day moving average in the past two years, the JETS 
ETF decisively broke above the line in 2023 - signaling a distinct change in character. 
Post Earnings Drift Potential / Bull Flags: Because markets are inefficient, stocks tend to trend after reporting stellar 
earnings like most airlines just did. Stocks like UAL rocketed higher in early 2023 and have been consolidating and 
digesting gains in a bullish manner since. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top 
stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with

It turns out that transporting thousands of passengers around the world in a metal tube is no easy task. The airline 
industry is one of the most complicated industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have 
inputs and outputs, the sum of which ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines

 Lack of Skilled Employees:Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the 
pandemic. 
 Outdated Airplanes:Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturing giant 
Boeing (BA) led to a lack of airplanes. 
Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life. The U.S. Global Jets 
ETF JETS[1] is used by investors as a proxy for the industry:

Airlines have rising consensus estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise 
Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. 
5 Reasons Airlines are Set for a Turbulent-Free 2023
Delta DAL[6] is one of the few airline stocks with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster 
quarter where EPS rocketed 573%. 
3. Oil Showing Signs of Lagging:The longer oil prices lag, the larger the headwind for the airline industry. Crude oil 
and oil-related stocks are beginning to exhibit relative weakness. For instance, over the past month, the S&P 500 
Index is +9.40% while Exxon Mobil XOM[7] is slightly lower.

Feb 06, 2023( DESIblitz: http://www.desiblitz.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Galentine's Day is a new celebration that is growing in popularity, especially amongst millennials who are 
constantly on the lookout for ways to commemorate it. 
Whilst many individuals will be aware of Valentine's Day as February 14th, the day to celebrate love, they will not 
have heard of Galentine's Day which is celebrated the day prior. 
Galentine's Day is an unofficial holiday to celebrate female friendships and honour a different type of love that you 
may have in your life, like the one that exists between friends. 
Valentine's day doesn't have to just be about romantic love it can be a day to celebrate all forms of love and 
Galentine's Day aims to do just that whether it's between friends or family. 
DESIblitz has put together a list of 10 of the best ways you can celebrate Galentine's Day this February 13th. 
Bottomless Brunch 
Going out for bottomless brunch has rapidly grown in popularity whereby groups are able to go out for a meal and 
get an unlimited number of drinks for the duration of their meal at a selected price. 
The concept has been a hit, especially with larger groups of people who are looking for a fun way to celebrate 
occasions whilst eating and drinking. 
There are many chain restaurants across the UK that now offer a bottomless brunch service. 
One of the most popular spots is Turtle Bay. Related Reads 
The Caribbean restaurant has been a major go-to brunch place for many as it is priced affordably at 31.50pp and 
offers two hours of unlimited cocktails, mocktails, red stripe and prosecco. 
Other popular bottomless brunch spots across the UK include Slug and Lettuce, Banyan and Manahatta. 
So, be sure to check them out this Galentine's Day. 
Pamper Night 
What better way to celebrate the love and respect in female friendships than a pamper night filled with fun, 
relaxation, and self-care? 
Spend the evening pampering yourself and your friends with a spa-inspired day filled with facemasks, mani-pedis, 
and massages. 
If you're struggling with where to get pamper evening essentials for you and the girls then be sure to check out the 
pamper and spa boxes sold by Beauty in the Box[1], Cult Beauty[2] and Sanctuary Spa[3]. 
10 Best Things to do for Galentine's Day
A pamper night will definitely boost spirits and create an evening of relaxation for you and the girls. 
Girls Getaway 
Galentine's Day is a perfect excuse to plan a girl's trip either abroad or even a staycation in a different part of the 
country. 
There are so many airlines like RyanAir and EasyJet that offer affordable flights across the world, especially in 
February as it is not a peak travel time. 
If going abroad isn't practical, but you would still like a weekend away, try booking a staycation in the country. 
The UK boasts beautiful cities like Edinburgh and York that have gorgeous sights, restaurants, and activities. 
Websites such as Booking.com, Loveholidays, and Lastminute.com, all offer last-second escapes within the country 
and outside of it. 
So, get planning your girl's getaway this Galentine's Day. 
Afternoon Tea 
If a more sophisticated outing is on your mind this Galentine's Day then plan afternoon tea for you and the girls. 
There are plenty of cafes and restaurants that offer an amazing afternoon tea service in the UK. 
For example, there is Betty's Afternoon Tea[4] in various locations across Yorkshire, Fortnum & Mason in London, 
and Malmaison in Birmingham. 
You could also plan your own afternoon tea and set it up from the comfort of your own home complete with finger 
sandwiches, scones, teacakes, and of course a big Victoria sponge. 
Movie Night 
A relaxing movie marathon with your best pals couldn't be a better way to enjoy and celebrate love in friendships. 
Many Galentine's films celebrate female friendships that you could choose from. 
Pick from Girls Trip, Thelma and Louise, 50 first dates, and Breakfast at Tiffany's, to name but a few. 
Alternatively, you could blitz through a box set and spend the day enjoying your favourite binge-worthy shows and 
films like Harry Potter or Friends. 
So warm up the popcorn and get your favourite movie snacks to celebrate Galentine's Day. 
Order a Takeaway 
You can't go wrong with a takeaway and a good movie so why not order a big takeaway for you and the girls to 
share this Galentine's Day? 
The cuisine options are endless when it comes to takeaways, and you can choose from Indian, Chinese, Mexican, 
Italian, and much more. 
There are enough varieties of food to please everyone. 
With food delivery apps like Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, ordering food for large groups has never been 
easier. 
A takeaway and a chilled evening with girls is the perfect option for those wanting a lowkey Galentine's on a budget. 
Exchange Gifts 
Most people buy gifts for their significant other on Valentine's Day, so why not buy a gift for your friends too? 
Exchanging gifts doesn't have to be limited to Christmas or for romantic couples on Valentine's. 
Gifts can also be exchanged between friends to honour platonic love as well. 
There are plenty of gifts you can get a friend this Galentine's including a spa treatment, flowers, chocolates or even 
a nice bottle of wine. 
If you're feeling extra lovey this Galentine's Day, why not get your best gal pals Galentine's Day cards too? 
You can customise your own special message to your girlfriends using Moonpig or Funky Pigeon to show your 
appreciation for them. 
Pottery Experience

Pottery is an artistic and stimulating outlet that has become extremely popular in recent years. 
New businesses have cropped up across the UK offering pottery-making sessions and classes for anyone and 
everyone.

are all businesses across the UK that offer package pottery experiences for groups of people. 
Or you can even buy a special someone a pottery experience voucher for Galentine's that they can use at a later

Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Top Momentum Stock for the Long-Term

Feb 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks 
#1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, 
more confident investor. 
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. 
With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better 
chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading 
under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, 
Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted 
stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings 
outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint 
Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Top Momentum Stock for the Long-Term
good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage 
change in earnings estimates. 
VGM Score 
What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it 
one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined 
weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and 
most promising momentum. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are 
right for you and your investing journey. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to 
pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 
(Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible. 
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate 
revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B. 
Momentum investors should take note of this Transportation stock. RYAAY has a Momentum Style Score of B, and 
shares are up 12.5% over the past four weeks. 
Three analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023, while the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.59 to $5.88 per share. RYAAY also boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.5%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

Why Ryanair (RYAAY) Stock Is Up 3.6% Since Q3 Earnings Release
Why Ryanair (RYAAY) Stock Is Up 3.6% Since Q3 Earnings Release

Feb 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] are performing well following the release of its third-quarter 
fiscal 2023 earnings report on Jan 30. Shares have gained 3.6% since then. The upside was due to the earnings 
beat reported by RYAAY. 
Lets delve deep into the earnings report and the guidance. 
Ryanair's third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) earnings of 95 cents per share (excluding 4 cents from 
non-recurring items) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. Revenues of $2,630.9 million missed the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,606.2 million. Revenues surged 40.4% year over year, driven by upbeat 
passenger volumes. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario in the Christmas/New Year period, RYAAY's profit after tax was €211 
million in third-quarter fiscal 2023 against a net loss of €96 million incurred a year ago. In the same time period, 
operating costs climbed 36% to €2.15 billion, driven by a 52% increase in fuel expenses to €0.90 billion. 
Average fares in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 were up 14% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. Net debt at 
RYAAY declined to €0.96 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Ryanair maintained its traffic forecast for fiscal 2023 of 168 million. Riding on a strong fiscal third quarter, profit after 
tax for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be in the €1.325 billion-€1.425 billion range. 
We remind investors that the current forecast was announced early last month owing to the surge in traffic 
witnessed during the peak Christmas/New Year period. The earlier guidance for profit after tax in fiscal 2023 was in 
the €1 billion-€1.20 billion band. 
Continuing the traffic strength in January, Ryanair flew 11.8 million passengers in the month, higher than the 7 
million flown a year-ago. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in January 2023 was 91%, compared with 
79% a year-ago. Zacks Rank Ryanair currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[2] 
Below we present some stocks from the Zacks Airline [3]industry, that have reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings 
beat. 
Why Ryanair (RYAAY) Stock Is Up 3.6% Since Q3 Earnings Release
Delta Air Lines' DAL[4] fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.48 per 
share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share. DAL reported earnings of 22 cents per share a year 
ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. 
Delta reported revenues of $13,435 million, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,030.3 
million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 41.87% on a year-over-year 
basis. Managementexpectsfirst-quarter 2023 earnings per share in the band of 15-40 cents. 
Alaska Air Group ALK[5] reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Quarterly earnings of 92 cents per share beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. The bottom line surged more than 100% year over year. 
Reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 14% to 
12.85 billion. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased 6.1 percentage points to 
85.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Economic fuel price per gallon climbed 57.1% to $3.55.

Ryanair expects to benefit from Asian and transatlantic traffic

 The return of Asian traffic to Europe and a particularly strong transatlantic market will likely see robust demand for 
Ryanair[1] from Easter in its Q1 FY24 through the summer period. With other airlines still at lower capacity 
compared to pre-pandemic levels and Ryanair up, the Irish airline group thinks it is well-positioned to benefit from 
demand “and hopefully from higher fares”, CEO Michael O’Leary said during today’s Q3 FY23 earnings call. 
Ryanair expects to benefit from Asian and transatlantic traffic. 
Ryanair already saw strong demand in the third quarter, which runs from October through December. October and 
Christmas traffic was good and in a quarter with almost no disruptions, it helped push total revenues up to €2.312 
billion from €1.470 billion. Revenues from 38.4 million passengers (previous year: 31.1 million) were up to €1.447 
billion from €788.1 million. Ancillary revenues like priority boarding, preferred seating, and onboard spending rose to 
€866 million from €682 million or €22.50 per passenger. Load factors were at 93 percent, up from 84. 
Operating costs were up 36 percent to €2.2 billion from €1.6 billion, with fuel costs up 52 percent to €908 million 
and staff costs up by an identical level to €293 million due to pay restoration of staff salaries. Ex-fuel, costs were up 
by 26 percent to €30 per passenger. The result was an operating profit of €161.7 million compared to €-116.7 
million last year. Profit after tax was €211.1 million or €202.1 million if a market-to-market loss on jet fuel caps was 
included, but was way better than the €-95.8 million reported in Q3 FY22. 
After many quarters of stimulating traffic with low fares, airfares were up by fourteen percent over the pre-Covid 
period in Q3. It all helped to grow market share in some key markets, with Italy now at over forty percent from 26, 
Poland at 38 from 27 percent, Ireland at 58 from 49 percent, and Spain at 23 from 21 percent. Forward bookings 
are still close-in, although demand for Easter in April is robust. Ryanair, Malta Air, Buzz, and Lauda plan to operate 
230 new routes, bringing the total to 2.450. Ryanair opened new basis in Belfast, Lanzarote, and Tenerife, but 
closed one at Brussels Charleroi after the airport announced significant cost increases. 
Providing there are no headwinds or adverse news coming from the war in Ukraine or Covid, Ryanair expects a full-
year profit after tax of between €1.325 and €1.425 billion as it said in its latest update on January 4. This is up from 
theNovember guidance[2] of €1.0 and €1.2 billion. It reiterates its guidance to carry 168 million passengers in FY23, 
growing to 185 million in FY24. It is too early to provide guidance for the next financial year. 
MAX deliveries might be pushed out 
Ryanair expects to benefit from Asian and transatlantic traffic
That growth is subject to deliveries from Boeing. The MAX 8200 fleet grew by eleven aircraft in Q3 to 84, providing 
a net fuel consumption benefit over the 737-800 fleet. The first NGs have received the MAX scimitar winglets that 
should reduce fuel burn per aircraft by 1.5 percent. Michael O’Leary counts on the delivery of forty MAX until this 
summer to bring the fleet to 124, but production issues at Boeing could slip some deliveries beyond the summer: 
“Boeing have recently improved in the rate and flow of deliveries but we still think they are facing challenges. We 
aren’t sure if we will get to the 124 aircraft by the end of April. At the moment, we are planning for about 114 
through the peak-summer months. If we can get more of those aircraft before the end of May, we will take them, but 
if they dribble into late June or July, we won’t take those deliveries and dispose of them until the winter.”  
Ryanair ended the quarter with €4.1 billion in liquidity and net debt of €0.96 billion, up from €0.5 billion at the end of 
Q2 thanks to €1.3 billion in capital expenditures. The group reaffirmed it will repay €1.6 billion in bonds in March 
and August. Capex will increase to €2.0 billion in FY23 and to €2.5 billion in FY24, which will be financed from its 
cash position. The carrier is 88 percent hedged for fuel for Q4 at $71 per barrel, sixty percent for HY1 at $90, and 
53 percent for HY2 of FY24. The lower costs per barrel give it a cost advantage this winter and next summer.  
In order to be prepared for the summer growth of ten percent, Ryanair has enrolled over 1.000 cadets in its pilot 
schools and continues training new cabin crew. It will create some 6.000 new jobs. That also includes non-aviation 
positions, including 150 IT specialists.

https://t.co/XcemXjNcRJ[1] — Utrust (@UTRUST) October 6, 2022[2] 
Everyone's got their hot takes on the US CPI number and what it will mean for markets. Here's another (better) way 
to think of it  
Via Morgan Stanley's Iliana Bouzali[3] "You can't prove (a) hard landing right now... but it might be easier to prove 
falling inflation" There's a massive disconnect between where we are right now and where 'everyone' thinks (and 
history suggests) we're heading.  
But you can't get to a hard landing without first passing though the 'soft landing' phase. Or maybe neither of those 
apply. Aircraft analogies are tricky.  
Imagine yourself sat on a plane. Doesn't matter if you're uncomfortable on a Ryanair flight with your knees up round 
your ears or living it up in first class luxury.  
Just imagine yourself in that big metal tube 30,000 feet in the air...  
Suddenly, the plane starts plummeting towards the ground. Everyone's screaming, your life flashes before your 
eyes, call your family, say your goodbyes, it's over. That's a crash landing. (Like March 2020) 
There's only one bet to make in that scenario. Back the pilot to pull off a last minute miracle and regain control of 
the plane before it 'lands'.  
The plane might not pick up speed any time soon, but death is avoided (and betting on the end of the world is 
negative EV[4] in any case).  
So that's one scenario. Then you've got your soft or hard landings.  
Thinking The Right Way About CPI
Which is where the analogy falls apart. Because nobody really wants to 'land' an economy. It's supposed to remain 
in perpetual motion, more like the common swift[5] (airborne 99.5% of a 10 month migration, insane!) than a 
passenger plane.  
So, we don't actually want to land, we just want to stay in this Goldilocks zone for as long as possible.  
At some point later in the year, we'll probably trade the hard-landing fears (the overshoot). However, all that matters 
right now is the dominant theme.  
It's often said that markets can only focus on one thing at a time, and inflation is that theme right now. Back to Iliana 
and... The better way to think about it 
"This is not an email to forecast the exact CPI but rather to say, in the short term, it is easier to trade inflation falling 
than it is to trade growth falling""Inflation expectations are coming down faster than growth expectations. This 
sequencing matters for risk. The market got giddy on signs that inflation is moderating - over the last 12 months the 
SPX has rallied 2.8% on average on CPI misses versus sold off 1.3% on CPI beats."So are we supposed to buy the 
market here? No...A  low CPI might lull people into a lazy long. But I think to a large extent it's been pre-traded. We 
can agree on that... More importantly, as Mike Wilson pointed out, the recent CPI prints trapped people in bad 
trades. In October you got your face ripped off on a higher CPI and in December you got smoked on a weaker 
number. Couldn't agree more with the above. More detail here  
A savvy take on CPI by Iliana Bouzali at MS - she's among the very best. My 2c: the feeling that stocks are going 
higher is hard to shake. Being short is so tough with CTA buying and inflation moderating. But scarcity is what can 
give value to a short and why I think she's right. pic.twitter.com/xtBRNzICN0[6] — boaz weinstein (@boazweinstein) 
January 12, 2023[7]; 
There's so much nuance to the inflation data too. Is the service sector still strong? What about core services ex 
shelter? Is the recent 'Goldilocks' jobs report a sign of things to come? More workers return to the labour force sees 
wage pressures declining, but a resilient economy continues to grow and keeps hiring? 
That last one doesn't seem like the best bet...  
For now, it's all about inflation and wages. Another soft print today could see a continued risk rally. But how much is 
already in the price?  
My read is that we're not done with this Goldilocks theme just yet, but who really knows? Volatility around the event 
is assured. Beyond that, anything can happen, and it probably will.

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - January 9, 2023 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], Gol Linhas 
GOL[2], Delta Air Lines DAL[3] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[4]. Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Airline 
Stock Roundup: DAL, GOL, RYAAY and More In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings lifted its profit 
after tax view for fiscal 2023 (ending Mar 31, 2023), owing to upbeat traffic in the Christmas season. Latin American 
carrier, Gol Linhas expects net revenues to be around R$20 billion for 2023, higher than the 2022 expectation of 
R$15.2 billion. 
Delta Air Lines was also in the news when it announced free Wi-Fi service on quite a few of DAL's domestic routes. 
JetBlue Airways was also a newsmaker in the past week, courtesy of the decision to tweak its New York-to-London 
flight schedule. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 For the fourth quarter of 2022, Gol Linhas anticipates[5] the 
EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, while it expects the EBIT margin to be 11%. GOL estimates the average 
fuel price per liter to be R$ 6.05. GOL anticipates a loss per share of $1.20 for the fourth quarter. The Zacks 
Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. The unfavorable forecast is mainly due to high fuel 
costs. 
Fuel unit costs are anticipated to grow almost 42% year over year, backed by a 45% increase in the average jet fuel 
price, partially offset by a reduction of nearly 2% in fuel consumption per flight hour due to the higher number of 
737-MAXs in the fleet. For 2023, GOL anticipates earnings of 20 cents per share. 
To meet the expected domestic air-travel demand of nearly 100 billion revenue passenger kilometers for 2023, GOL 
aims to operate 120 aircraft on average during the year. GOL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), 
anticipates[6] to end 2023 with 53 Boeing MAX aircraft in its fleet. These Boeing MAX jets should boost productivity, 
reduce unit costs and lower carbon emissions.

results will be out on Jan 30. Riding on a strong Q3, profit after tax for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be in the 
€1.325 billion - €1.425 billion range (earlier guidance was in the €1 billion to €1.20 billion band). 
RYAAY was also in the news recently regarding an enquiry by antitrust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-
fixing. That story was covered in theprevious week's write-up[8]. 
3. In a bid to make air-travel more attractive, Delta's management announced that free Wi-Fi will be available on 
more than 500 DAL planes operating on its most popular routes from February. This facility is expected to be 
available on all DAL flights across the globe by 2024-end in partnership with T-Mobile. 
4. JetBlue's management has reportedly[9] decided to add a new flight departing in the mornings from John F. 
Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow Airport from Mar 25. The new flight was added as JBLU 
got access to an additional pair of slots. JBLU has also decided to trim its schedule on the JFK - Gatwick Airport 
route. Only one flight will operate daily on the route from Mar 25, instead of the current two. The current daily 
schedule of three flights from JFK and London's two airports will remain unchanged. Performance All airline stocks 
traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased 7.1% to $56.02 over the past 
week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0.8%. What's Next in the

German air travel slow to recover from COVID-19 pandemic
German air travel slow to recover from COVID-19 pandemic

Jan 07, 2023( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Germany is lagging behind other EU countries in terms of seats sold on flights to and from the country, figures 
show. Domestic air travel is showing the slowest recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Air travel to 
and from Germany in the first half of 2023 is likely to reach just 78% of the rate before the COVID pandemic broke 
out in 2020, according to figures released by the German Aviation Association (BDL) on Saturday. 
This means Germany is lagging behind its EU peers in the sector, with air travel in other European countries at 94% 
of the pre-pandemic level. 
The figure does, however, represent 20% growth compared with the first half of 2022. 
What are the reasons for the slow recovery? 
The BDL said the lower level of domestic air travel, which has reached only 56% of the pre-pandemic rate, is largely 
responsible for the slow recovery. 
"Here, a shift in traffic to road and rail is noticeable, among other things" it said. 
However, the drop in domestic flying can also be attributed to the fact that low-cost airlines are avoiding most 
German airports, while increasing their services elsewhere. 
This is reflected by statistics showing that the number of connections from German airports are more than a third 
lower than before the pandemic. 
Only four of Germany's larger airports — Dortmund, Hahn, Karlsruhe and Memmingen — will be offering more 
flights in the first half of 2023 than in the same period in 2019, largely owing to the presence of lower-cost airlines. 
The boss of the economy airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has in the past criticized German airports for their high 
fees. His carrier and the cut-price airline Wizz have raised the number of flights they are offering outside of 
Germany. 
Long-haul flights, on the other hand, have made a better post-pandemic recovery, with trips to and from North 
America as the biggest factor.

Jan 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 After reaching an important support level, Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) could be a good stock pick from a 
technical perspective. RYAAY recently experienced a "golden cross" event, which saw its 50-day simple moving 
average breaking out above its 200-day simple moving average. 
Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed 
when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common 
crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts. 
Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that 
eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average 
and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices. 
This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish 
price movement. 
Shares of RYAAY have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 11%. Plus, the company is currently a #3 
(Hold) on the Zacks Rank, suggesting that RYAAY could be poised for a breakout. 
Looking at RYAAY's earnings expectations, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. For the 
current quarter, there have been 1 changes higher compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate has moved up as well. 
Given this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on 
RYAAY for more gains in the near future. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Jan 02, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Air travel in Europe recovered to 83 percent of 2019 levels by the end of last year or to 9.3 million flights. This is 
3.1 million flights up on 2021, but still 1.9 million down on 2019, Eurocontrol says in its 2022 analysis paper[1]. The 
organization sees further recovery in 2023, but that won't come without issues. Air travel Europe recovers but 
punctuality suffers. 
Eurocontrol[2] notes that the recovery of the number of flights from 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 to on 
average 83 percent at the end is in some way remarkable, given that the first months were dominated by the 
downturn caused by the Omicron virus. And then, at the end of February, Russia started the war in Ukraine, which 
affected airspace in some parts of Europe. But the effects of both crises were rather limited and traffic already hit 86 
percent in May and remained between 86-88 percent for the rest of the year. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-02.png?ssl=1 
European airlines carried a combined two billion passengers last year. The busiest carrier by the umber of daily 
departures and arrivals was, as in 2019, Ryanair, with 2.536 daily flights. This is up nine percent on 2019 or 77.000 
flights over the full year. easyJet was runner-up with 1.335 flights, but this is twenty percent down on 2019. Turkish 
Airlines came third with 1.245 flights (-7 percent) and outpaced Lufthansa, which operated 158.000 fewer flights 
largely due to strikes last summer. Air France is in the fifth spot, ahead of KLM, whereas British Airways dropped 
two places in the listing, behind Wizz Air ahead of subsidiary Vueling and SAS. Wizz saw a fourteen percent 
increase in the number of flights, or 30.000 extra. 
'Lufthansa, Air France, and KLM, as traditional mainline carriers reliant on a hub model, have recovered slower than 
their low-cost counterparts. In particular, Lufthansa (-29 percent versus 2019) has seen a very weak recovery in 
German internal demand, with a rise in alternative methods of travel or reduced business travel by air', the 
Eurocontrol report notes. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-02-2.png?ssl=1 
Delays 
But as the year progressed, the more serious became staffing issues at airports and air navigation services 
providers across Europe. Flights departed on average 17.6 minutes late by the end of the year, up from 13.1 
minutes in 2019. 'Arrival schedule delay (actual arrival time compared with scheduled arrival time) increased to 16.9 
Air travel Europe recovers but punctuality suffers
min/flight from 12.7 min/flight in 2019 (+33 percent). Departure schedule delay was also up to 19.6 min/flight in 
2022, rising from 15.3 min/flight in 2019.' 
As a result, punctuality suffered: arrival punctuality was on average 71.7 percent, down 6.4 percent from 2019. 
Departure punctuality dripped by even 6.8 percent to 65.9 percent. During the summer peak, punctuality dropped to 
between 50-60 percent. Of the delay, on average 2.17 minutes was caused by air traffic management issues 
andATM inefficiencies.[3] 
In the top ten of most punctual European airlines, Vueling is in the top spot, followed by SAS (despite or maybe 
even thanks to the long summer strike), KLM, and Ryanair, while Wizz Air is in the top ten position with punctuality 
between 50 and 60 percent. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-02-4.png?ssl=1 
The busiest airport in Europe was Istanbul, which saw 1.156 daily flights. Despite the capacity cap that has been in 
place since June, Amsterdam Schiphol is closely behind with on average of 1.140 daily flights, which is just 
eighteen flights more than Paris Charles de Gaulle. 
Eurocontrol also looked at the status of carbon dioxide emissions. Between January and November 2022, these 
were 19.6 percent lower compared to 2019 at 15.1 percent fewer departures. Excess fuel burn was between 3.1 
and 6.1 percent, well below the seven to eight percent in 2019. The report notes that long-haul flights, which 
account for 5.5 percent of all flights, are responsible for 43.9 percent of all emissions. Short- to medium-haul flights 
(share 43 percent) cause 23.2 percent of emissions. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-02-3.png?ssl=1 
Outlook 
In its outlook for 2023, Eurocontrol expects air travel in Europe to further recover to 92 percent but not return to full 
pre-Covid levels until 2025. This is one year later than it the June forecast and takes the weak economic growth, 
inflation, and the continuation of the war in Ukraine into account. 
'However, 2023 is set to be the most challenging year of the last decade. Keeping summer delays down will be an 
immense task for all actors, with airspace issues due to the Ukraine war, new aircraft delivered, possible industrial 
action, system changes and the progressive reopening of Asian markets all asking real questions of the system.'

Dec 29, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Southwest Airlines LUV[1]was the chief newsmaker, albeit for wrong reasons. The Dallas-based 
carrier was the worst affected U.S. airline in terms of flight cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions 
during the Christmas holiday weekend. Meanwhile, United Airlines UAL[2] management decided to resume 
operations to Tokyo from Denver. This route was suspended when the pandemic was wreaking havoc. Recap of 
the Latest Top Stories 1Southwest Airlines canceled 62% of its flights on Dec 27. What is worse is that LUV's rivals 
have seen their operations being disrupted at a much lower scale. We note that LUV is the biggest carrier serving 
Buffalo, NY, the hardest-hit urban area by this natural catastrophe. Management has apologized to passengers for 
the harassment they had to face due to the disruption in operations. The disruption is likely to hit LUV's fourth-
quarter 2022 performance. Many market watchers believe that it will take around a week for LUV to recover from 
this fiasco of gigantic proportions. 
LUV was also in the news recently when the union, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 
covering its customer service employees, ratified a pay-related deal. That story was covered in the previous week's 
write-up[3]. 
2. UAL will resume operating non-stop flights from Denver to Tokyo from Mar 4, 2023. Return flights from Tokyo's 
Narita International Airport to Denver International Airport will start taking to the skies from Mar 5, 2023. Initially, the 
service will be available three times a week. Flights will depart from Denver to Tokyo on Monday, Thursday and 
Saturday. Return flights to Denver will take to the skies on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Flights on the route will 
operate daily from Mar 25, 2023[4]. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5] 
3. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] along with the likes of Wizz Air and easyJet, will reportedly[7] face an inquiry by anti-
trust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-fixing. The allegations surfaced for flights operated by the airlines in 
and out of Sicily. The enquiry is expected to be completed by 2023-end.A complaint of price-fixing lodged by 
consumer group Codacons has led to the investigation. 
4. With COVID-19 cases on the rise in China, the United States has announced that passengers coming to the 
country from China, Hong Kong or Macau are required[8] to show negative COVID-19 test reports. The requirement 
will come into force from Jan 5, 2023 and is applicable to passengers above two years. Per the new rule announced 
by the Biden administration, passengers traveling to the United States directly from China and also those who were

in thecountry 10 days beforetheir departure to the United States will have to take a COVID-19 test (no more than 
two days before travel) and furnish a negative report before boarding the flight. Performance The following table 
shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
inched down 3.1% to $51.16 over the past week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 10.3%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual updates in the space. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

 Here's the updated model with Boeing's November 2022 Orders & Deliveries. 
Notes: 
November saw two big orders - Alaska 32; IAG 50. (December looks to be even better) As the map on the left 
indicates, Boeing remains USA focused for orders this year (53.5%) 
We will identify the MAX deliveries by model in our daily tracker 
Boeing is (like Airbus) coming out of the Covid slump 
Page 3 of the model clearly shows this 
Southwest (45) and Ryanair (38) are the top two delivery customers Among deliveries, 74% are CFM powered, and 
20% are GE powered We estimate 260 MAX deliveries YTD through November  
Of these, over 80% are MAX8s

 A meeting between Germany's and Britain's top diplomats was canceled after a build-up of ice prevented Annalena 
Baerbock's plane from taking off on time.Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock had to cancel a meeting 
with her British counterpart after her airplane was grounded in Ireland due to ice. 
Baerbock said she was "very sad," she could not meet British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly. 
"But you can't do anything about force majeure — and certainly not about unexpected ice and snow in Dublin," the 
minister said. 
She was due to fly back to Berlin after the aircraft was de-iced. 
Baerbock met her Irish counterpart Simon Coveney in Dublin on Thursday. 
She was keen to travel to the UK too to underline the importance of Germany's partnership with Britain despite the 
problems caused by Brexit. 
"We are close partners and friends," the minister said in Berlin before departing for a visit to Ireland and Britain on 
Thursday. 
The meeting has been postponed twice before, once for the crisis when British prime minister Boris Johnson 
resigned and the second time due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September. 
German government officials stranded before 
It's not the first time problems with planes have derailed German diplomacy. 
In 2018, then Chancellor Angela Merkel famously missed the opening of the G20 summit in Argentina after her 
plane was forced to land shortly after leaving Berlin. 
A year later the Foreign Minister at the time, Heiko Maas, was stranded in Mali after his airplane was unable to 
depart due to a problem. 
Ice not mechanics the problem 
Germany's Air Force has since purchased three new Airbus A350s for VIP transport to replace the ageing fleet of 
government planes. 
The issue on Friday, however, seemed to have been caused by the weather at Dublin airport rather than with the 
plane. 
Several frustrated passengers took to social media to complain about long delays. 
Dublin Airport and Ryanair, which uses it as a hub, wrote on Twitter that severe ice had caused flight delays and 
cancelations.

pandemic-induced hiatus of more than two years. With air-travel demand buoyant in Brazil, Gol Linhas GOL[2] 
reported a 28.5% year-over-year increase in November traffic. European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] 
reported a 9.8% year-over-year increase in passenger volume for the month of November. JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] 
was also in the news owing to its environmentally-friendly attitude. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[5]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. In November, RYAAY flew 11.2 million 
passengers, higher than 10.2 million flown a year-ago. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in November 
2022 was 92%, compared with 87% a year-ago. Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Ryanair was also in the news when it inked an environmentally-friendly deal with oil company Shell SHEL[6] for 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The MoU will see Shell supply SAF to more than 200 Ryanair airports across 
Europe, with the primary focus on the airline's major hubs in Dublin and London Stansted. Per the agreement, 
Ryanair will be able to access 360,000 tons (120 million gallons) of Shell's SAF between 2025 and 2030. This will 
help the airline cut its carbon emissions by about 900,000 tons.

2. At Gol Linhas, consolidated traffic for November increased 28.5% year over year. To match the increased 
demand situation, the company is expanding its capacity. During the same month, capacity grew 29.7% year over 
year. GOL carried 26% more passengers in November from the year-ago levels. Upbeat traffic in its domestic 
markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In November, domestic traffic and capacity improved 
18.7% and 19.6%, respectively. On the domestic front, 21.7% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in November 
2022. 
3. Following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act, which prohibited airlines from paying dividends till Sep 
30, 2022, Southwest Airlines' management reinstated its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier 
returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was 
hugely-expected. The dividend will be paid on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on 
Jan 10.

On its investor day, LUV also gave projections for some items for first-quarter and full-year 2023. Capacity 
(measured in available seat miles) is expected to increase 10% and 15% year over year, in first-quarter and full-
year 2023, respectively. Fuel cost per gallon is expected in the $3-$3.10 range in the March quarter. The same is 
expected in the $2.85-$2.95 range for full-year 2023. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be either flat or increase 
up to 2% year over year in first-quarter 2023. The metric is expected to be down in the 1-3% range for the full year. 
Interest expense is expected to be roughly $65 million and $250 million in first-quarter and full-year 2023, 
respectively. Capital spending for full-year 2023 is anticipated in the $4- $4.5 billion range. LUV expects to end the 
next year with 841 planes in its fleet. 
4. JetBlue's management stated that it aims to reduce emissions pertaining to jet fuel by 50% per revenue tonne 
kilometer by 2035 from 2019 levels. In accordance with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, JBLU aims to 
boost investments in lower-carbon solutions within its operation and evaluate future sustainability investments. 
JBLU aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040,10 years ahead of broader airline industry targets.

The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
has decreased 4.4% to $58.18 over the past week. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
declined 17.8%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Delta Air Lines' DAL[8] management is scheduled to provide a 
financial outlook and provide a strategic update at an event in New York on Dec 14. With air-travel demand soaring, 
we believe that this Atlanta-based carrier's management will present a rosy picture with respect to the top line. 
With oil price still high the bottom-line growth is being restricted. As a result, market watchers will keenly await the 
steps outlined to reduce costs and dive growth. Stay tuned for other usual updates in the space.

Dec 07, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shell plc SHEL[1], the oil supermajor, entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Irish airline 
Ryanair RYAAY[2]. The MoU will see Shell supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to more than 200 Ryanair airports 
across Europe, with the primary focus on the airline's major hubs at Dublin and London Stansted.  
Per the agreement, Ryanair will be able to access 360,000 tons (120 million gallons) of Shell's SAF between 2025 
and 2030. This will help the airline cut its carbon emissions by about 900,000 tons. 
SAF, which is considered the key facilitator of aviation decarbonization, accounts for a trivial portion of worldwide jet 
fuel usage. Both parties resolved to advance the supply and use of SAF, with Ryanair committing to powering 
12.5% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and Shell aiming for renewable fuel to account for 10% of its global jet sales 
by the end of the decade. 
The MoU was signed at Aviation Sustainability Day, an event held at Trinity College Dublin's Sustainable Aviation 
Research Centre. 
Shell Aviation's president, Jan Toschka, stated that the prospect of building on Shell's existing relationship with 
Ryanair is fantastic. He further said that the initial agreement demonstrates that both firms recognize that SAF is the 
key to unlocking a net-zero future for the aviation industry. 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company Ryanair, which commenced its 
flight operations in 1985 and is based in Swords, Ireland. This ultra-low-fare carrier offers scheduled-passenger 
airline service in Ireland, the UK, Continental Europe, Morocco and Israel. 
Shell is one of the primary oil supermajors, a group of U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with 
operations spanning worldwide. The company is fully integrated as it participates in every aspect related to energy, 
from oil production to refining and marketing. SHEL operates as an energy and petrochemical company. 
Shell currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the energy space that warrant a look 
include Murphy USA MUSA[3] and Liberty Energy LBRT[4], each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[5] 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Murphy USA's 2022 earnings stands at $25.34 per share, which suggests an 
increase of 69.8% from the year-ago earnings of $14.92. 
MUSA beat the consensus mark for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average being approximately 51%. 
Shell ( SHEL ), Ryanair Collaborate for Sustainable Aviation Fuel
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Liberty's 2022 earnings is pegged at $2.02 per share, which implies an increase 
of about 298% from the year-ago loss of $1.02. 
LBRT beat the consensus mark for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being around 58.4%. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double" 
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

 British Airways[1] can finally realize its low-cost aspirations after its subsidiary BA Euroflyer has received its own 
Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) and Operating Licence (OL). BA Euroflyer will now gradually take over the parent 
airline's international short-haul network at London Gatwick. BA Euroflyer gets ready to stand on its own feet. 
BA announced in 2021 that it intended to establish BA Euroflyer as a separate entity with a lower cost structure[2], 
in its quest to fight competition at Gatwick from easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. Since it stopped international short-
haul services from Gatwick at the beginning of the pandemic, BA had left this market share unprotected. easyJet in 
particular has been strengthening its base at Gatwick, while Wizz entered the market by basing five aircraft there. 
Although officially just a paper airline until it would receive the AOC in the autumn of this year, BA launched 
Euroflyer on March 29, 2022 by operating under the British Airways AOC. Now that the CAA has approved the 
certificate and license, BA will transfer twenty Airbus aircraft to Euroflyer in the coming six months. One A320 is 
already registered with BA Euroflyer, but ten more will join as well as nine A321s. Crew will be (re)trained to comply 
with the airline's AOC requirements. 
BA Euroflyer will operate under the same principles as BA Cityflyer, the regional subsidiary that is based at London 
City Airport with a fleet of Embraer aircraft. But it has a different cost structure to make it more competitive with rival 
airlines. It took BA many rounds of negotiations to secure union support for its low-cost initiative. Cabin crew union 
Unite initially strongly opposed the plan, but approved the terms and conditions in November last year. This was a 
few weeks after the pilot union BALPA had agreed. In both cases, keeping as many jobs as possible at a time when 
BA had slashed some 10.000 positions during the pandemic was the main reason for the union's support. 
Euroflyer operated on over thirty routes this summer, including Amsterdam, Marrakech, and Santorini. The 2023 
summer schedule includes 29 destinations, many in the Mediterranean region like Italy, France, Croatia, Greece, 
Spain, Portugal, but also Turkey.

Dec 02, 2022( Biofuels Digest: http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In Ireland, Ryanair and Shell signed a Memo of Understanding (MOU) to advance the supply of sustainable 
aviation fuel (SAF) at over 200 Ryanair airports across Europe, with particular focus on SAF supply at RYR's 
largest bases like Dublin and London Stansted[1]. 
While SAF is a key enabler of aviation decarbonisation, it currently accounts for just a small fraction of worldwide jet 
fuel usage. This agreement with Shell gives Ryanair potential access to 360,000 metric tons (120 million gallons) of 
SAF between 2025 and 2030, saving over approx. 900,000 tons in CO2 emissions (equiv. to over 70,000 flights 
from Dublin to Milan). The SAF that is covered by this MoU could potentially be produced from multiple different 
technology pathways and a broad range of sustainable feedstocks. 
This agreement, which was signed at the Sustainable Aviation Research Centre in Trinity College Dublin (TCD) this 
morning (where Ryanair and TCD held an Aviation Sustainability Day), demonstrates both Ryanair and Shell's 
commitment to work together to invest in SAF supply fuels. Ryanair has set itself ambitious targets of 12.5% SAF 
by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

 EasyJet is to increase fares by more than 20 per cent and even higher at peak Christmas holiday times as the 
airline attempts to claw back losses totalling more than 2 billion. 
The bid to repair the fortunes of Britain's busiest short-haul airline and avoid big seasonal losses will mean easyJet 
flying 17 per cent fewer seats this winter and 11 per cent fewer as a whole for its financial year through to next 
September. 
While the airline expects to return to profitability next year, at this stage forecasts are for about 250 million, which is 
less than half that reported before the pandemic. The uncertainty surrounding the fortunes of the airline industry in 
general during this winter's expected recession in the UK and Europe, and the impact on easyJet in particular, sent 
the stock lower again in trading yesterday. 
After a four-week, 40 per cent rally from a ten-year low of 285p last month, the shares fell 2.6 per cent, or 10p, 
yesterday to close at 383p. 
The pan-European airline, which does half its business in and out of the UK, reported a summer trading quarter 
better than any other in its 27-year history with profits of 674 million. But after a heavily lossmaking winter last year 
and a chaotic post-pandemic restart to business last spring hampered by staff shortages, easyJet still managed to 
make losses in its financial year to the end of September of 178 million. 
Analysts believe that a recovery to profitability will be slow, with profits of no more than 250 million in its current 
financial year. That is in stark contrast to Ryanair, its big rival in the European short-haul market, which is on track 
to report profits back above 1 billion. 
EasyJet expects to fly 94 million seats this year[1] on which it might reasonably expect to carry 85 million 
passengers, down 11 per cent on pre-pandemic levels. For comparison, next year Ryanair expects to carry 186 
million passengers, 24 per cent above its pre-pandemic levels. 
EasyJet's capacity, as in the number of seats it will be flying over the next year, as a percentage of its pre-
pandemic flying schedule will sequentially be 84 per cent in the current Christmas quarter, 82 per cent in the 
traditionally slow months of January to March, 93 per cent in the Easter and spring quarter, and 99 per cent in the 
high summer peak season. 
The airline is deliberately targeting near-term capacity at Christmas and new year and the half-term skiing holidays, 
while paring back its schedules in between. 
EasyJet bumps up its ticket prices by 20 per cent as losses soar to 2bn
It reported that with two months gone of this quarter and Christmas holiday season bookings in place, revenues per 
seat — a reasonable proxy for ticket prices — are on average up 20 per cent on top of the 33 per cent increase 
over the past year. 
Asked if rising fares were sustainable during a cost of living crunch, Johan Lundgren, chief executive, said: 'We are 
seeing strong demand at peak times, and that is reflected in these numbers. But outside the peak we are having to 
stimulate the market.' 
That indicates that with having to cut fares to get people flying during the slow weeks this winter, peak fares are 
rising well in excess of 20 per cent. 
Asked about the City's forecasts of profitability of just 250 million in the current year, Lundgren, 56, said: 'If we were 
not comfortable [with the forecasts] we would have to say so. 
'There is uncertainty around macroeconomic factors and we respect that people need to see more clarity around 
those factors. But we are making progress on productivity and our transformation of the business, and demand 
remains strong for people wanting to go on holiday.'

Nov 28, 2022( Legal Futures: https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/EasyJet.jpg EasyJet: Airline could pay compensation without 
requiring claims 
EasyJet's latest effort to cut out solicitors from flight delay claims has failed, after the Court of Appeal found 
shortcomings in its automated system. 
Though the court upheld[1] the role of automated systems for flight claims in principle, it said EasyJet's failure to 
allow a customer to see what data had been entered so they could correct errors put a material obstacle in their 
way, in breach of the relevant regulation. 
Lord Justice Males also observed how EasyJet could pay flight delay compensation without needing passengers to 
claim but chose not to in the hope that some would not. 
The two claimants had valid claims for €250 each subject to the question of whether they first applied for the 
compensation directly to Easyjet, using its online dispute resolution system. 
EasyJet's terms and conditions required passengers to submit claims 'directly' and give it 28 days to respond to 
them before engaging third parties to claim on their behalf. 
In July 2019, the claimants' solicitors, Surrey law firm Lovetts. wrote a letter before action to EasyJet. The airline 
replied by taking the point that no claim had been submitted via the online portal. 
This was finally done in April 2021 by an employee of claims business Flightright and the system generated an 
automatic email response which stated that the airline had been unable to find the booking and asked the 
passengers to resubmit their claim. 
Giving the lead judgment, Lord Justice Birss observed that the email did not identify any particular error in what had 
been entered or set out what had been entered; it simply asked them to start again. The system did not allow 
customers to see what information had been entered previously. 
Only after the decisions at first instance and on first appeal - which went in favour of the airline - did it became clear 
that the booking references of the two passengers had been erroneously transposed, meaning the names entered 
did not match the booking references. 
Birss LJ agreed with the ruling in Bott v Ryanair that 'airlines are entitled to require the use of a well-designed online 
dispute resolution portal for those passengers who are capable of using them'. 
Court of Appeal rules against EasyJet again on flight delay claims
He continued: 'However, this dispute has shown that even people who are experienced in using such systems can 
make mistakes, and the automatic email response in this case was not helpful because it did not spell out what data 
had actually been entered in the first place. 
'Had it done so, the submitter could have rechecked and correctly entered the data, and this litigation would likely 
have been avoided. No doubt the airline would rather not go to the effort of coding the system to do that, but I 
cannot imagine that it would be difficult to do.' 
The system here risked 'itself amounting to a material obstacle in the way of passengers making claims', contrary to 
the regulation. 
Snowden and Males LJJ both agreed, with the latter saying 'we need not have too much sympathy for EasyJet'. 
He explained: 'Its computer knows which flights have been subject to delay and knows the identities of the 
passengers on those flights. 
'Although there was no evidence about this, it ought not to be difficult for it to contact passengers (or at any rate, 
those who have made the booking for passengers) who are entitled to compensation, but no doubt it suits EasyJet 
that a certain percentage of passengers will never bother to claim. 
'So, although EasyJet is not required to contact passengers in this way, in a sense any costs incurred in handling 
the claims of those passengers who do claim can be set against the savings achieved as a result of deciding not to 
pay compensation unless a claim is made.' 
But he accepted that easy-to-use automated online systems for handling flight delay claims was 'strongly' in the 
interests of passengers so they could receive 'prompt payment without incurring legal fees or needing to pay claims 
companies'. 
They were also in the public interest 'because such claims should be capable of resolution in this way and court 
proceedings should only be necessary where there is some issue which only a court can decide'. 
He laid out four conditions for such a system: 
The airline's terms and conditions must make clear to the passenger that the use of the online system is 
compulsory, and must be used before court proceedings are commenced; The passenger should have the ability - 
and be strongly encouraged - to save the submitted claim; The system should explain that certain details incorrectly 
entered lead to the claim being rejected; and If a claim is rejected on the ground that the claim details have not 
been correctly entered, the automated response sent by the airline must make this clear. EasyJet's system 'did not 
satisfy any of these requirements', Males LJ said. 
He agreed with Birss LJ's comment that costs should not necessarily follow the event in this case. 
'I would urge the parties, in this low-value claim where the costs far exceed the amount claimed, to reach some 
sensible agreement about costs in order to avoid yet further expense,' Males LJ said. 
The court also rejected EasyJet's complaint that, as the claimants had not made their online claims themselves, 
they had breached its terms and conditions. 
Birss LJ: 'Even if the matter was free from authority, I would hold that passengers are entitled to have someone else 
access the online portal on their behalf and thereby make a claim in their name. 
'That other person could be a friend or family member, or it could be a claims handling company or solicitor 
engaged for that purpose. A claim made that way would be 'direct' as that word is used in the conditions of carriage. 
'Furthermore if the true construction of the word 'direct' would not permit this activity, then it would be a material 
obstacle in passenger's path and would be unlawful and ineffective. 
'The fact that an airline may prefer it for passengers not to engage a claims handling company at that early stage to 
use the online portal is irrelevant.'

ITA Airways' future now seems to depend on Lufthansa and Italian railway company FS
ITA Airways' future now seems to depend on Lufthansa and Italian railway

 Italian media speculate thatLufthansa[1] is looking for a new partner to acquire a majority stake in ITA Airways. The 
name that is mentioned most often is that of the Italian railway company Ferrovie Dello State Italiane[2], or FS for 
short. ITA Airways' future now seems to depend on Lufthansa and Italian railway company FS. 
The privatization ofITA Airways[3] continues to surprise observers as potential buyers are constantly changing. 
After the initial interest of Lufthansa Group at the beginning of this year following a joint offer from Lufthansa and 
shipping company MSC Group. They seemed in pole position until a consortium led by US investor Certares, Delta 
Air Lines, and Air France-KLM entered the scene. 
The Italian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance entered exclusive negotiations with Certares that were 
expected to result in a firm agreement. But the new Meloni Administration opted not to extend the period of 
exclusivity after October, which reopened options for Lufthansa and MSC for new negotiations. The German/Swiss 
consortium was given exclusive access to ITA's data room until MSC Group caught many by surprise by 
announcing early this week that it would withdraw from the bidding process. MSC stated it did no longer recognize 
conditions in the current bidding process, an indication that things have become blurred. 
The MSC decision has left privatization in turmoil. Certares seems out of the picture altogether now, which would 
make Lufthansa the sole candidate. The German airline group is keeping its lips tight and isn't sharing its cards with 
the media. Italian newspapers report that Lufthansa might have three options now: go it alone and make an all-out 
bid for ITA Airways, forgo the opportunity and close the book on ITA, or find a partner. 
This is where FS comes into the picture again. The Italian rail company has been touted as the buyer of ITA's 
predecessor Alitalia in 2019, when it teamed up with Atlantia, Delta Air Lines, the Ministry of Economic Affair and 
Finance, and initially easyJet to acquire eighty percent of the ailing airline. Although this bid failed, some, including 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, have always believed that Fs would eventually buy ITA Airways. 
La Corriere Della Sera[4]reports that a joint offer could leave Lufthansa with a 51 percent share of ITA for €250 
million, with FS buying 29 percent for an undisclosed amount. The Italian state would retain twenty percent of the 
airline. This compares to just twenty percent for Lufthansa in the offer with MSC, in which the shipping group would 
take a sixty percent share. The Certares consortium was offered a 50.01 percent share, with the Italian state 
retaining 49.99 percent. 
ITA Airways' future now seems to depend on Lufthansa and Italian railway company FS
For the government, it is key that ITA Airways finds itself 'a solid industrial partner to guarantee a certain future for 
the airline', Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Giancarlo Giorgetti, reportedly saidin a press conference[5] 
on Tuesday. And this needs to be done quickly, as according to media reports in Italia, ITA is running out of cash 
quickly. Despite securing another €400 million in state support recently, its cash is set to be reduced to just €100 
million in the coming months. The carrier can count on a final €250 million installment of the original €1.35 billion 
that was provided in 2021. Earlier this month, ITA said that it had secured the finance for theacquisition of 39 new 
aircraft[6] in 2023.

 We've already seen how handy it's been in all the usual places you'd use a digital wallet — plus some others, like 
attending concerts with friends. Let's look at four different ways you can use Google Wallet around the world. 
Make quick, secure payments from your watch: Last month we added Wallet to the Google Pixel Watch[1] so you 
can easily make contactless payments. And starting today, anyone with a Fitbit Sense 2 or Versa 4[2] can pay with 
just a tap of their wrist. Tap and pay on public transit: If you're one of the millions of people who commute by public 
transportation, you can use Wallet to tap and pay in hundreds of cities around the world. In Japan, we recently 
added support for PASMO[3] on mobile devices and launched Suica[4] on the Google Pixel Watch. Save mobile 
tickets for events and shows: We're partnering with many companies — including Ticketmaster, Thaiticketmajor in 
Thailand, Cinemaxx in Germany and Ticketek, Humanitix and Oztix in Australia — so Android users can add mobile 
event tickets to their Wallet. My daughters are big Taylor Swift fans, so I'll be trying out this feature for her tour next 
year. Access boarding passes: There's so much to keep track of before a flight. So we partner with airlines like 
AirAsia, Air France, China Air, Ryanair and United Airlines to help travelers easily save and access their mobile 
boarding passes in Wallet. You can even save multiple boarding passes if you're traveling with family or friends. Pro 
tip: To quickly add your boarding pass, just take a screenshot of it on your Pixel phone and tap 'Add to Google 
Wallet.' 
These are just some ways you can use Google Wallet throughout your day. As Wallet expands to more places 
around the world, look out for even more features to easily access what you need.

Nov 11, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - November 11, 2022 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], Gol Linhas 
GOL[2], Frontier Group ULCC[3], American Airlines AAL[4] and Copa Holdings CPA[5]. Here are highlights from 
Thursday's Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: Earnings, Traffic and More In the past week, Ryanair Holdings 
reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for second-quarter fiscal 2023 due to high costs. 
Gol Linhas posted a 40.9% year-over-year increase in consolidated traffic, reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand. 
Hurricane Nicole was the latest weather-related disruption to hurt airline operations. An expansion-related update 
was also available at Frontier Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Frontier Group, in the past week. Recap of 
the Latest Top Stories 1, Ryanair's second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Sep 30, 2022), earnings of $5.32 per share 
(excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.43. Revenues of 
$4,046.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,023.8. Revenues surged 92.3% year over year driven by 
upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of a buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1371 million in first-half fiscal 2023 against 
a net loss of €48 million incurred a year ago. In the same time period, operating costs surged 126% to €4.98 billion, 
due to a 205% increase in fuel expenses to €1 billion. 
Average fares in the first half of fiscal 2023 were up 7% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. The same was up 
14% in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second 
quarter from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
In first-half fiscal 2023, RYAAY's revenues surged 207% year over year to €2.15 billion on the back of buoyant 
traffic. Scheduled revenues in the same period increased 250% to €4.42 billion. 
The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 95.1 million in the first half, up 143% from the same 
period's level in the last fiscal year. The traffic was 11% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-half 
fiscal 2023 was 94% compared with 39% in the previous fiscal year's comparable period. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Ryanair , Gol Linhas, Frontier Group , American Airlines and Copa Holdings
Ryanair upped its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 168 million from 165 million. The new guidance indicates a 13% 
growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. Management expects profit after tax in fiscal 2023 in a range of €1 
billion to €1.20 billion. The guidance is dependent on RYAAY not experiencing any adverse events this winter. In 
fact, management has warned that recovery for the remainder of fiscal 2023 may be impacted by new Covid 
variants or adverse geopolitical events. 
RYAAY was also in the news recently, when it reported upbeat traffic results for October. The story was reported in 
detail in the last week's write-up[6]. 
2. In October, Gol Linhas' consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 2.9 percentage points 
to 81.4% with traffic growth (40.9%) lagging the capacity expansion of 46% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its 
domestic markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In October, domestic traffic and capacity 
improved 30.2% and 26%, respectively. On the domestic front, 26% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in 
October 2022. Domestic load factor was 81.6%. The volume of departures and seats on the domestic front 
increased 30.9% and 31.1%, respectively. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
.3. To expand its network, Frontier Airlines reportedly[8] announced new routes serving Phoenix and Dallas-Fort 
Worth. Last Friday, Frontier launched its base at Phoenix. Following the launch, the carrier is operating daily flights 
connecting Phoenix with Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Detroit and Orange County, California. Frontier will operate 
flights to Cincinnati four times a week.ULCC also aims to expand its presence in Dallas-Fort Worth this spring. 
4. With Nicole strengthening from a tropical storm to a hurricane, American Airlines has decided to waive change 
fees for flights connected to 20 airports in Florida, Georgia, the Bahamas and Providenciales in the Turks and 
Caicos Islands. Due to hurricane Nicole, multiple flights connecting the Charlotte Douglas international airport and 
the airports mainly in Florida and Georgia were cancelled. This is causing untold harassment to passengers and 
deals a blow to airlines, already suffering labor woes. Performance Even though most airline stocks have traded in 
the red over the five trading days, the losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
increased, albeit marginally, to $58.79 over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index has plummeted 20%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 
2022 earnings report of the Latin American carrier Copa Holdings, scheduled to be out on Nov 16. 
We expect CPA's performance to have been aided by the improving air-travel demand in Latin America. However, 
high fuel costs are likely to have impeded the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Why Haven't

Nov 10, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported lower-than-expected earnings per sharefor second-quarter 
fiscal 2023 due to high costs. Gol Linhas GOL[2] posted a 40.9% year-over-year increase in consolidated traffic, 
reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand. Hurricane Nicole was the latest weather-related disruption to hurt airline 
operations. An expansion-related update was also available at Frontier Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Frontier Group ULCC[3], in the past week. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1, Ryanair's second-quarter fiscal 2023 
(ended Sep 30, 2022), earnings of $5.32 per share (excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) missed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $5.43. Revenues of $4,046.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,023.8. 
Revenues surged 92.3% year over year driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of a buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1371 million in first-half fiscal 2023 against 
a net loss of €48 million incurred a year ago. In the same time period, operating costs surged 126% to €4.98 billion, 
due to a 205% increase in fuel expenses to €1 billion. 
Average fares in the first half of fiscal 2023 were up 7% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. The same was up 
14% in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second 
quarter from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 
In first-half fiscal 2023, RYAAY's revenues surged 207% year over year to €2.15 billion on the back of buoyant 
traffic. Scheduled revenues in the same period increased 250% to €4.42 billion. 
The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 95.1 million in the first half, up 143% from the same 
period's level in the last fiscal year. The traffic was 11% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-half 
fiscal 2023 was 94% compared with 39% in the previous fiscal year's comparable period. 
Ryanair upped its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 168 million from 165 million. The new guidance indicates a 13% 
growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. Management expects profit after tax in fiscal 2023 in a range of €1 
billion to €1.20 billion. The guidance is dependent on RYAAY not experiencing any adverse events this winter. In 
fact, management has warned that recovery for the remainder of fiscal 2023 may impacted by new Covid variants 
or adverse geopolitical events. 
RYAAY was also in the news recently, when it reported upbeat traffic results for October. The story was reported in 
detail in the last week's write-up[4]. 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Q2 Earnings Miss, GOL 's October Traffic
2. In October, Gol Linhas' consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 2.9 percentage points 
to 81.4% with traffic growth (40.9%) lagging the capacity expansion of 46% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its 
domestic markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In October, domestic traffic and capacity 
improved 30.2% and 26%, respectively. On the domestic front, 26% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in 
October 2022. Domestic load factor was 81.6%. The volume of departures and seats on the domestic front 
increased 30.9% and 31.1%, respectively. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
.3. To expand its network, Frontier Airlines reportedly[6] announced new routes serving Phoenix and Dallas-Fort 
Worth. Last Friday, Frontier launched its base at Phoenix. Following the launch, the carrier is operating daily flights 
connecting Phoenix with Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Detroit and Orange County, California. Frontier will operate 
flights to Cincinnati four times a week.ULCC also aims to expand its presence in Dallas-Fort Worth this spring. 
4. With Nicole strengthening from a tropical storm to a hurricane, American Airlines AAL[7] has decided to waive 
change fees for flights connected to 20 airports in Florida, Georgia, the Bahamas and Providenciales in the Turks 
and Caicos Islands. Due to hurricane Nicole, multiple flights connecting the Charlotte Douglas international airport 
and the airports mainly in Florida and Georgia were cancelled. This is causing untold harassment to passengers 
and deals a blow to airlines, already suffering labor woes. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that even though most airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the 
losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased, albeit marginally, to $58.79 
over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 20%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await the third-quarter 2022 earnings report of the Latin 
American carrier Copa Holdings CPA[8], scheduled to be out on Nov 16. 
We expect CPA's performance to have been aided by the improving air-travel demand in Latin America. However, 
high fuel costs are likely to have impeded the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Ryanair 's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing
Ryanair's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing

Nov 07, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair[1]is buoyant that its total number of passengers carried in FY23 will reach a record-high 168 million and 
net profit reach between €1.0 and €1.2 billion. The airline expects to build on a strong HY1, although it takes a 
cautious eye to what happens with Covid and Ukraine this winter. And if Boeing is able to deliver on its promises 
Ryanair's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing. 
In the March-September period, Ryanair produced a pre-exceptional net profit of €1.263 billion compared to €-47.6 
million in the same period of FY22. The result includes a €-107.4 million loss on jet fuel caps. The carrier generated 
€4.424 billion in passenger revenues and €2.191 billion in ancillary revenues or €23 per passenger. The combined 
€6.616 billion in revenues compares to €2.155 billion last year. Ryanair, Malta Air, Buzz, and Lauda carried a 
combined 95.1 million passengers, up from 39.1 million last year. The load factor was 94 percent, nearing 96 
percent of FY20. 
Looking at HY1 revenues, Italy continues to be the strongest single market, with €1.5 billion earned there, ahead of 
Spain with €1.2 billion and the UK at €980 million. Ireland contributed €377 million and other markets with €2.7 
billion. Total expenses of €5.1 billion include €2.3 billion in fuel costs compared to €713.1 million last year, but as it 
flew more, all other costs were also higher. Costs per passenger were €31. The net profit was €1.515 billion, up 
from €-50.5 million last year. 
In Q2 (June-September), Ryanair benefitted from higher fares, up fourteen percent of FY20, and more than 
offsetting the weak Easter period in Q1 that was affected by lower bookings after the war in Ukraine started. 
Operating at 115 percent capacity over the summer, Q2 revenues jumped to €4.015 billion €1.784 billion in the 
same period last year. Expenses were up by over a billion euros this quarter to €2.739 billion, producing an 
operating profit of €1.276 billion (2021: €254 million) and a net profit of €1.076 billion (€225 million). 
CEO Michael O'Leary was keen to stress that Ryanair didn't suffer from operational or staffing issues of its own 
during the summer, although it suffered from ATC problems and a number of strikes. He claimed a cancelation rate 
of just 0.02 percent of all flights, but these were for the UK flights only. That Ryanair escaped problems has to do 
with crewing up early for this summer and not cutting on crew training and recruitment, 'as we knew there would be 
a recovery.' It caused huge gains in market share, up fourteen percentage points to forty percent now in Italy and to 
thirty percent on Wizz Air's home ground in Hungary (up thirteen percent). For its future growth, the airline needs 
6.000 new staff and is already training over 1.000 pilot cadets right now and recruiting new maintenance staff. 
Ryanair 's FY23 guidance depends on Covid and Boeing
'Impact inflation is exaggerated' 
O'Leary repeated that the coming winter season will be loss-making, as it is its weakest season and another 
Omicron situation or effects from the war in Ukraine could be on their way. However, he isn't somber about the 
economic outlook and downplayed the effects of inflation on his airline. 'Concerns about the impact of recession 
and rising consumer price inflation on Ryanair's business model have been greatly exaggerated in recent months. 
As the lowest-cost producer in Europe, we expect to grow strongly in a recession as consumers won't stop flying, 
but rather they will become more price sensitive. Like (supermarket discounters) Aldi, Lidl, Ikea, and other price 
leaders our very strong post Covid recovery shows that price will continue to drive market share gains as we add 
low-cost, more fuel efficient, aircraft to our fleet over the next four years.' 
O'Leary thinks that Ryanair will benefit more than others from the contraction in short-haul capacity that has 
happened in Europe since the pandemic. 'Most of our EU competitors have cut capacity by up to twenty percent 
this winter while Ryanair will offer ten percent more seats than pre-Covid.' Based on strong bookings in October 
and for the upcoming Christmas period, the airline is optimistic about the current Q3 but says it has 'zero visibility 
into Q4' (January-March) when it trims back capacity to 110 percent. Yet, Ryanair has modestly raised its guidance 
for FY23 and now expects to carry 168 million passengers, up from 166.5 million in its previous guidance and 165 
million in July. Reaching 168 million would be up thirteen percent over pre-pandemic levels.

Worries about MAX deliveries 
If Ryanair succeeds, depends on the arrival of 51 more Boeing MAX 8200 aircraft until next summer. The airline 
currently operates 73 of them but expects only ten or twelve more before the end of the year instead of the planned 
twenty. 'Boeing assures us that they will deliver all scheduled 51 Gamechangers ahead of peak S.23, although 
there is a risk that some of these deliveries could slip,' said O'Leary. This could affect deliveries in Q4 and Q1 in 
FY24, which is the first quarter of the upcoming summer season.  
There is uncertainty if five to ten aircraft are being delivered on time, which would leave Ryanair at 41-45 MAX 
8200s by next summer. 'We are planning FY24 growth based on 51 extra aircraft for peak S.23 and we continue to 
recruit and train substantial numbers of pilots, cabin crew and engineers.' He added: 'Even if Boeing leaves us 
slightly short of aircraft, we have a reasonable chance of getting to 185 million passengers in FY24.' 
Reaching 225 million in FY26 remains the target and is possible without extra aircraft, so there is no pressure the 
order the MAX 10 that Ryanair is keen to have. O'Leary said that he thinks it is vital that US Congress gives Boeing 
an exemption on the December 31 deadline and have it certified without the need for a cockpit systems update: 
'There are thousands and thousands of jobs across North America relying on that extension. We also think it is a 
critical safety issue: we don't want to see two different cockpit types on the MAX.' 
Ryanair's current 409 737-800s will be looking a bit more like the MAX as they will be fitted with identical scimitar 
winglets from the coming winter period. The airline will invest €200 million in a wingtip retrofit as the new version will 
give a 1.5 percent fuel burn improvement per aircraft. In September, Ryanair signed an uptake agreement with 
OMV for 160.000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at airports in Austria, Germany, and Central Europe. This 
complements the uptake agreement with Neste at Amsterdam Schiphol. 
Long-term labor agreements 
The airline says that it has now reached new long-term agreements about pay and rosters that cover ninety percent 
of pilots and cabin crew through 2026-2027. The pay restoration, which was brought forward from 2025 to April next 
year, has been further advanced to the coming December on the back of the strong HY1 results. This restores the 
pay cuts that were agreed upon in 2020 following the Covid crisis. O'Leary called on the remaining ten percent of its 
pilots in Belgium and Ireland to resume negotiations and sign the new agreements. 
Ryanair ended September with €4.6 billion in cash, up one billion from March. Net debt was reduced by a billion to 
€0.5 billion. 'Our focus over the next year is the repayment of €1.6 billion of maturing bonds (in March and August) 
while returning our balance sheet to a broadly zero net debt position' by March 2024. Over ninety percent of its 
current fleet is unencumbered. Capital expenditures for FY24 will be around €2.2 billion, with aircraft purchases 
financed from its own resources and hedged through 2026. The airline has hedged 81 percent of fuel this FY23 and 
currently fifty percent for FY24, with currencies hedged at eighty percent this financial year and twenty percent next 
year.

 In the classic marketing book, The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding, authors Al Ries and Laura Ries state that a 
successful branding program is based on the concept of a singularity.  
It creates in the mind of the prospect the perception that there is no product on the market quite like yours. 
Furthermore they argue that you should strive to own one word in the mind of the consumer - a word that defines 
your brand and what is special about it. 
For example Volvo built its reputation and brand positioning on one word; safety. Volvo became successful first in 
Europe and then in the USA by owning the word 'safety' in the mind of the car buyer. Similarly Mercedes 
represented 'prestige' and BMW, 'The ultimate driving machine.' Once these brands became successful they made 
the common mistake of expanding the brand and therefore weakening its single differentiating property. Volvo 
introduced a sports car. Mercedes launched cheaper models and BMW brought out a staid station wagon. 
Broadening the base and moving into other markets can look attractive but it can fatally weaken the brand. It is 
better to introduce a new brand than to damage the perception of your winner. 
People associated the word Xerox with copiers. They even said 'take a xerox copy of this.' When Xerox launched a 
range of Xerox computers it flopped. The brand is not what the people in the marketing department want it to be. It 
is the perception that exists in the mind of the customer - and once that is established it is hard to change and 
dangerous to meddle with. 
Fedex focused on a single message - overnight delivery. Ryanair positions itself as the cheapest airline. Apple 
represents cool design. Once the positioning is established each new product or line extension should support and 
reinforce the message. If not it is better to start with a separate brand name. Holiday Inn was clearly positioned as 
an inexpensive, value for money hotel chain. It wanted to move upmarket so it launched a range of more expensive 
hotels under the banner, Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza hotels. Expanding the brand with sub-brands is a common 
tactic and is often a mistake. In this case the market was confused. Were the new hotels expensive or were they 
Holiday Inns? Eventually the company got the message and changed the brand name to simply Crowne Plaza. 
By all means innovate but any new product or service which deviates from the single key message of your 
established brand should have a different name or else it might do more harm than good.

 Climate change is a subject that few needan introduction[1] to. The world is continuing to seelong-term changes in 
temperature and weather patterns, some of which are being driven by humans. The prevalent use of non-renewable 
energy has increased this shift in climate, forming new issues in other markets. One industry that is seeingnew 
obstacles due to climate change is thetravel industry[2].  
Specifically in Europe, rising temperatures make traveling to specific areas in the summer less appealing[2]. Europe 
is home to many of the most visited travel destinations[3] in the world, accounting for two-thirds[4] oftotal 
international arrivals with bothLondon and Paris in the top-ten[3] most visited cities. Travel is also important for the 
European Union's (EU)economy, making up10% of its GDP[5]. In 2021, travel and tourism were responsiblefor 
around 34.65 million jobs[6] in Europe. As the world is reopeningand the pandemic diminishes, the number of 
people traveling to Europe is increasing annually[7], indicating a bright future for this important sector of Europe's 
economy. 
Western Central Europe is one of theregions in the Northern Hemisphere that has faced extreme heat, water 
shortages, and dry soil conditions in thesummer of 2022[8]. Forest fires[9] in France[10], the worst droughts[11] the 
EU has seen in centuries, and record-breaking temperatures are all signalingclimate change in the area. While 
Europe is working through an energy crisis[12], amenities such as air conditioning[13] are regulated by the EU. 
Some popular European destinations such as London do nothave air conditioning[14] due to the historic 
architecture not needing it in the past, making it difficult to support travelers in need of this amenity.European flight 
companies including easyJet[15], Wizz Air[16], and Ryanair[17] are all having to cancel flights due to runways being 
too hot at the London Luton Airport[18]. As the temperatures in the continent continue to get harsher, tourists and 
the companies serving them have started to shift their ways of thinking about international travel. 
Shifts in the travel industry can be seen at many levels. For one, the period when people are traveling is becoming 
wider[2]. Theshoulder season[19] is the month right outside the main window for travel that is becoming more 
stretched every year, and this used to consist ofMay and September. As people are planning their vacations for less 
intense temperatures, the shoulder of the usual tourism season[19] is shifting towards April and October. When the 
temperatures rise, research shows[2] that people do less retail shopping while traveling, adding yet another 
consequence for the local businesses depending on these shoppers. 
While some people are choosingto travel at different times of the year, others are seeking different countries[19]to 
visit.One example is Iceland[20], which has seen a steady increase in tourism[21] in the past 20 years. Jóhannes ór 
Skúlasyn, the director of the Icelandic Tourism Association, says thatmore large hotels[22] are needed to match the 
European Travel is Being Held Back by Climate Change
tourism growth. Iceland's hotel industry is a mix[23] of independent and chain hotels, making a change like this 
have varying impacts on these hotel operations. Companies like Keahotels[24] have received American investment 
during Iceland's tourism boom[25], assisting the brand in keeping up with capital and construction necessary to 
serve this tourism sector.Other countries are also following Iceland's path, withSweden[26], Norway[27], and 
Ireland[28]also seeing increased tourism over the last decade[29]. 
While Europe is working on becoming carbon neutral, climate change will not stop without drastic change. Although 
the patterns in the European travel market are small at the moment, they are predicted to continue increasingover 
the coming years[19]. Whether it is Iceland creating more hotels or England working around the unusual 
temperature increases, the changes in European travel will be more prevalent[19] as the years and changing 
weather goes on.

 In the past week, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] reported a wider-than-expected loss per share for third-
quarter 2022 due to high costs. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] posted upbeat traffic data for October, driven by the 
buoyant air-travel demand scenario. Mirroring the labor woes for U.S. airlines, United Airlines' UAL[3] pilots voted 
down the tentative deal that its union had inked with the airline. 
Read the last Airline roundup here[4]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Allegiant Travel reported a third-quarter 
2022 loss (excluding $2.04 from non-recurring items) of 54 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of a loss of 47 cents. Operating revenues of $560.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $556.6 
million and increased 21.9% on a year-over-year basis. 
Passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk (92.2%) of the top line, rose 21.9% on a year-over-year basis. The 
upside can be attributed to improved air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs) 
for scheduled service climbed 15.7% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat miles or 
ASMs) inched up 0.1% year over year. Load factor increased 1190 basis points to 88.5% in the reported quarter as 
traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion. 
Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel and effects of Hurricane Ian, for the total system 
escalated to 7.81 cents from 6.18 cents a year ago. Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up in excess of 
75% to $3.84 in the quarter. Total scheduled service passenger revenue per available seat miles rose 21.2% to 
12.60 cents. ALGT exited the September quarter with 116 planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2022 is 
expected to be 123. 
For fourth-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon is expected to be $3.75. Total operating revenues are likely to increase 
in the 26.5-28.5% band from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to increase in the 13-15% 
range. Capacity for scheduled service and total system are likely to increase 13.5% and 15%, respectively, from 
respective fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. 
2. In October, RYAAY flew 15.7 million passengers, the highest-ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. 
Last October, only 11.4 million passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor increased to 94% from 84% in 
October 2021. The number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in October 2022 was 14% higher than the 13.1 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Q3 Loss, RYAAY 's Rosy Traffic in October & More
million passengers flown in October 2019 (pre-coronavirus era). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
.3. Pilots at United Airlines, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, voted against a pay-related tentative deal 
inked a few months ago. 9,980 UAL pilots participated in the voting procedure with an overwhelming 94% casting 
votes against the deal. They believed that the terms fell short of their expectations. Pilots will now commence a 
series of informational picketing events to convince UAL to resume talks to finalize an agreement. 
4. In a similar development, American Airlines' AAL[6] pilots reportedly[7] voted down an offer by the company as 
they believe, the current offer does not match their expectations. Per the Allied Pilots Association, the union 
representing the pilots, its board voted down the offer 15-5. The turned-down proposal included pay raises of 19% 
in three steps over a two-year duration. The rejection highlights labor problems for U.S. airlines as they grapple with 
pilot shortage in the face of a strong rebound in air-travel demand. 
 Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

The table above shows that even though most airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the 
losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased, albeit marginally, to $58.35 
over the past five trading days. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 23.2%..

 A new month and an opportunity to look back. What do we see for new delivery estimates through October 2022? 
Here are some notes from our delivery tracker. Official OEM numbers will be published around the 10th of 
November.  
The duopoly remains out of balance. This is a concern for the entire commercial aviation sector.  
Airbus is out delivering Boeing by 1.3 to 1 and Airbus has hardly any freighter business YTD Airbus has a 53.3% 
delivery market share to Boeing's 39.3% 
This is despite the top delivery customers for Boeing being Southwest, Ryanair, Alaska, and United, respectively 
The most delivered new aircraft are MAX8 (216), A321neo (193), A320neo (159), and MAX9 (45) - 33 new MAX8-
200s have been delivered through YTD October  
The disparity between Airbus and Boeing is writ large - Boeing needs the MAX10 ASAP The threat of cancellation 
is a double-edged sword for Boeing - Boeing needs the MAX10 and cancellation weakens the MAX family where it 
needs the most support 
In terms of twin aisles, Airbus delivered 40 A350-900s, 8 A350-1000s, 16 A330-900s, and 2 A330-800s. Boeing 
delivered 19 777Fs, 13 767Fs, 11 787-8s, 4 747Fs 3 777s, 2 787-10s and one 787-9 
Airbus is coming to the freight business late. The freighter (and military) business has been a savior for Boeing. 
Embraer remains primarily a regional-focused OEM. It delivered three times as many E-175s and E2s.

Got bitten by the aviation bug and ended up an Avgeek. Then the data bug got me, making me a curious Avgeek

 by Kieran McCarthy[1] 
When the Supreme Court decided Van Buren v. United States last summer, many Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
experts[2] felt that the decision avoided the worst interpretations of the CFAA, while consciously leaving most of its 
practical applications for lower courts to decide later. Sixteen months later, we're starting to see those practical 
applications get decided. 
Unlike most CFAA cases, RyanAir DAC v. Booking Holdings[3], 2022 WL 13946243 (D. Del. Oct. 24, 2022), 
presents a fact-pattern that just about anyone can understand. Booking Holdings is the parent company for 
Kayak.com, Priceline, Booking.com, and other prominent online travel agents ('OTAs'). It is the largest OTA in the 
world. 
Ryanair is Europe's largest discount airline. Its business model is to sell highly discounted flights at, near, or below 
cost and then to make additional profits by selling ancillary services such as food, drinks, rental cars, hotels, and 
insurance on their site and on their flights. But much of this business model is contingent on being able to sell flights 
directly through Ryanair's site to control the market for ancillary services. 
Ryanair has a long history of litigating against OTAs in Europe and the United States. It has previously litigated 
against OTAs in Spain, France, Ireland, and Switzerland, with mixed results. It previously litigated against Expedia 
in Washington.[4] 
The facts of the case are relatively simple, with a couple of twists. Booking Holdings is the parent company of 
multiple OTAs that publish fare data and sell Ryanair flights in purported violation of Ryanair's terms of service. As 
usual in these types of cases, Ryanair sent cease-and-desist letters to Booking telling it to stop. Needless to say, it 
didn't stop. When Booking didn't stop, Ryanair sued for five different violations of the CFAA. 
One twist is that Ryanair cannot sue Booking in the United States for breach of its terms of service, because 
Ryanair's terms of service are governed by Irish law and require the jurisdiction of Irish courts. Because Ryanair 
cannot invoke its terms of service in the United States, it must resort to unique causes of action for which there is 
not a comparable remedy in Ireland. In this instance, the CFAA. 
The other twist is that Booking did not scrape or access Ryanair's data directly from Ryanair's site. Rather, it hired a 
few different third-party sites to collect the data and provide it to them. Booking was hoping this might forestall any 
Does the CFAA Help Airlines Control Their Distribution Channels?-RyanAir v. Booking (Guest Blog Post)
CFAA liability. According to Booking's briefing for this motion, the CFAA is fundamentally a computer access 
statute. Without access, there can be no violation of the CFAA. 
With that background, Booking filed a motion to dismiss the CFAA claims based on two primary arguments: 1) 
Booking is using publicly available data obtained from a third party to sell Ryanair flights. Based on the holdings of 
Van Buren and hiQ Labs II, this conduct does not trigger CFAA liability; 2) Even if this conduct were sufficient to 
trigger direct CFAA liability, the CFAA does not provide for vicarious liability. 
The District Court of Delaware mostly denied Booking's motion to dismiss. 
With respect to the 'publicly available data' argument, the court decided that these facts were more akin to the facts 
of Power Ventures than those of hiQ Labs. Power Ventures was a 2016 case involving Facebook (back when the 
company itself was still known as Facebook). Power Ventures was a platform that attempted to enable users to 
manage all their social media accounts from one platform. To do so, they had to take users' log-in credentials on 
the various platforms and collect users' data from those platforms to aggregate it within the Power Ventures 
platform. 
The key issue in that case was whether Facebook had the authority to invoke the CFAA against a third-party 
company (in that case, Power Ventures) that had allegedly violated Facebook's terms of use using the valid log-in 
credentials that it had consensually received from Facebook's users. The Ninth Circuit panel said that while users 
have the right to grant a third-party access to their Facebook accounts, that Facebook had a right to revoke access 
to those credentials at its discretion, even though the credentials were still valid for the users themselves and 
consensually given by the users to Power Ventures. 
I thought this was wrongly decided then, and I still think this is wrong now. The proper remedy for Facebook in this 
situation should be simple—if it doesn't like that a user has shared their credentials, terminate or suspend their 
account. But allowing a private company to invoke a criminal statute for violating its terms of use against a third 
party because of consensual password sharing gives private companies far too much power and is beyond the 
scope of the statute. 
The CFAA is an anti-hacking statute; password sharing isn't hacking. Indeed, this would seem to contradict the 
(needlessly opaque) instructions from the text of Van Buren itself, which said, '[a]n interpretation that stakes so 
much on a fine distinction controlled by the drafting practices of private parties is hard to sell as the most plausible 
[interpretation of the CFAA].' Van Buren at 20. 
That said, hiQ Labs I and hiQ Labs II both distinguished Power Ventures; those cases did not repudiate it. And so 
the Delaware court found it dispositive here. 
If you want to buy a ticket on Ryanair, you must create an account with a username and password. According to 
Power Ventures in the Ninth Circuit and now this case in Delaware, that step likely allows you to invoke the CFAA 
against a third party for violating your terms of service and for continuing to access a website after receiving a 
cease-and-desist letter—even though the exact same conduct in the absence of a username and password 'risks 
the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest.' hiQ Labs II at 43. 
The court was also not persuaded by Booking's arguments that vicarious liability is unavailable under the CFAA, 
even though many cases seemed to suggest as much. For example, consider this language from Koninklijke Philips 
N.V. v. Elec-Tech International Co., Ltd.: 
Plaintiffs here make no allegation that either Mr. Wang or Ms. Chan was given Dr. Chen's password and then ran 
searches, nor do they allege that either individual Defendant in any way accessed or downloaded information from 
Lumileds' network. By the Complaint's own allegations, none of the CFAA Defendants accessed Lumileds' 
information-Dr. Chen did, at a time when he was authorized to download this information. Even if he 
misappropriated the information, and gave it to the CFAA Defendants, Nosal forecloses a claim against those 
Defendants under the CFAA because they themselves did not hack Lumileds' system. Plaintiffs' argument that Dr. 
Chen and the CFAA Defendants were essentially 'acting as one' for purposes of accessing the files does not save 
Plaintiffs' CFAA claim. Rather, it shows that this case is factually quite similar to Nosal: it is alleged that outsiders 
convinced an insider to access information the insider was authorized to access, then hand that information over to 
the outsiders. While such allegations could possibly state a claim for misappropriation, they cannot state a claim 
under the CFAA after Nosal. Reading the CFAA in its context as an anti-hacking statute, 'access' means something 
more than persuading someone to procure information you desire. Instead, as described by the district court in 
Nosal II, '[t]he common definition of the word 'access' encompasses not only the moment of entry, but also the 
ongoing use of a computer system.' Nosal II, 930 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1063 (N.D. Cal.2013). None of the CFAA 
Defendants entered or used Lumileds' network. At most, they encouraged Dr. Chen to do so, and stood to benefit 
Does the CFAA Help Airlines Control Their Distribution Channels?-RyanAir v. Booking (Guest Blog Post)
from the alleged misappropriation. This action may give rise to a number of claims, but it does not support a theory 
of liability under the CFAA. (emphasis mine) 
Koninklijke Philips N.V. v. Elec-Tech International Co., Ltd. 2015 WL 1289984 at 4 (N.D. Cal. March 20, 2015). 
It wasn't a total loss for Booking, though. It scored a minor victory when the judge granted its motion to dismiss with 
respect to RyanAir's Section 1030(a)(5) allegations, which prohibits 'knowingly caus[ing] the transmission of a 
program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally caus[ing] damage without 
authorization, to a protected computer.' 
For me, any CFAA decision that makes it illegal to aggregate price information that anyone can access online is a 
bad one. Price comparison services benefit everyone except for companies looking to obfuscate prices and 
eliminate competition. Every human being—including the executives of Booking Holdings—can go to Ryanair's web 
site today and look at how much it costs to fly from Dublin to Barcelona (or Girona, since Ryanair is too cheap to fly 
directly to Barcelona). According to Van Buren, '[CFAA] liability [] stems from a gates-up-or-down inquiry—one 
either can or cannot access a computer system, and one either can or cannot access certain areas within the 
system.' Ryanair permits anyone to view its price and flight data. Everyone can access the system—except those 
whose technology and services threaten their business model. 
I understand why Ryanair wants to control or redirect traffic to its site. Every for-profit company is in the business of 
making money. I just don't think that a federal anti-hacking statute should be the legal mechanism that allows them 
to do that. There are a panoply of state-law claims that have been litigated in similar cases with similar facts. And 
however that might play out in state or federal court would depend on the nuances of the relevant state, federal, 
and international legal precedents. But to make this a CFAA issue just seems wrong to me. 
This decision allows Ryanair to selectively invoke the CFAA against a company that harms its business model for 
the mere act of harming its business model. That's not what the statute is designed to prevent. But that is precisely 
what courts are allowing it to be used for.

UK and US 
The biggest alternative legal services provider (ALSP) in Ireland is heading to London and the US next year after 
closing a €10.5m (9.1m) funding round. 
Dan Fox, chief executive of Johnson Hana, said staff numbers at the firm could double by the end of next year from 
240, including 200 lawyers, to almost 500. 
The funding round was led by AIB plc and backed by 'a host of angel investors'. 
Johnson Hana, founded by Mr Fox and his brother Alex in 2017, provides its clients, many of whom are multi-
national companies, with two main services - legal process outsourcing and contract lawyers. 
Mr Fox said most of Johnson Hana's lawyers worked on a part-time basis, often for around 20 hours a week. 
'We want to inject some flexibility into the lives of the lawyers, which we believe have been prejudiced for too long.' 
He said Johnson Hana had successfully 'developed momentum' with multi-nationals and 'grown with them'. The firm 
works for Ryanair, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. Around 5% of its work is for law firms, such as Linklaters. 
Mr Fox said he had 'grand ambitions' for Johnson Hana. 'We believe we could become the world's best ALSP. 
Nobody has really quite identified yet the true potential scale of legal work that is process rather than legal advice.' 
He said it was important to get 'boots on the ground' in the UK and US next year, and by the summer new offices 
should be in place in London and San Francisco. This would bring the staff total by the end of 2023 to somewhere 
around 500. 
Mr Fox said Johnson Hana was also looking to 'double down' on the growth in the Republic of Ireland, which he 
described as 'probably the most antiquated market that there is'. 
He went on: 'There must be a better way. Legal work and process must be carved up so that businesses can pay 
for value. There has been an absence of management and technology tools here, to ensure the right lawyer is 
undertaking the right task.' 
However, government agencies and the Irish government had led the way with outsourcing. 
Another advantage of Ireland lay in the multi-nationals that had relocated since Brexit, along with the talent pool of 
'English-speaking, highly educated lawyers, who want to work in more flexible ways'. 
Ireland 's biggest ALSP heads to London after 9m funding boost
In a separate development, Manchester-based contract management specialist Summize has secured 5m funding 
to expand into the US. 
The funding was raised through YFM Equity Partners' British smaller companies venture capital trusts (VCTs) and 
the Maven VCTs. 
Tom Dunlop, co-founder and CEO at Summize, said the company, launched in 2018, helped clients secure greater 
value from business contracts by speeding up and automating processes, from creating a contract through to 
analytics and summaries. 
'Unlike many of our competitors, our system integrates directly with existing collaboration tools, which is vital for 
adoption across the business.' 
Mr Dunlop, a solicitor and former in-house lawyer, said: 'The Series A funding will enable us to build out our sales 
and marketing capabilities and accelerate expansion with a presence in the US, which is a huge potential market for 
us.' 
Summize said it had more than 100 businesses on its platform, including Fujifilm, Everton FC, Moonpig and The 
Modern Milkman. 
Speaking to Legal Futures[1] in the summer, Mr Dunlop predicted that embracing change and innovation would 
separate winners from losers among law firms.

 Ruja Ignatova, founder of the notorious crypto pyramid Onecoin, was reportedly alerted about police investigations 
into the scam before she disappeared. The 'Cryptoqueen' has been on the run for several years, wanted by law 
enforcement agencies around the world. 
Onecoin Mastermind Learned About Arrest Efforts From Leaked Police Documents, Podcast Reveals 
A media report has shed light on how Onecoin's founder Ruja Ignatova may have been warned about the plans to 
detain her months before she disappeared almost five years ago. That's according to files seen by the BBC, which 
airs a podcast devoted to the story of the infamous fugitive called 'The Missing Cryptoqueen.' 
The documents were shown by Frank Schneider, a former intelligence officer from Luxembourg and once trusted 
adviser to Ignatova who is facing extradition to the U.S. for his alleged role in the Ponzi scheme. Schneider denies 
obtaining the files himself and claims he received them on a flash drive from Ruja while the metadata suggests she 
got them through her own contacts in Bulgaria. 
The 42-year-old Bulgarian-born Ignatova, also a German national, is wanted by Interpol, Europol[1], and the FBI[2] 
for misappropriating $4 billion from defrauded investors. She was last seen on Oct. 25, 2017, when she boarded a 
Ryanair flight bound for Athens. Media reports unveiled[3] this summer that the Greek police tried to locate her, 
acting on information about her recent meetings in the country. 
According to the BBC, the police files contain presentations made during a meeting on 'Operation Satellite' at 
Europol's headquarters in The Hague held on March 15, 2017. It was attended by representatives of the FBI, the 
U.S. Department of Justice, and the New York District Attorney. Officers from the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, 
Dubai, and Bulgaria were also present. 
The participants discussed details of the investigation into the crypto pyramid, including unsuccessful attempts by 
the City of London Police to interview Ignatova. The FBI did not comment on the Europol documents but Special 
Agent Paul Roberts told the podcast: 
There were investigations all around the world into her, and into Onecoin generally, many of which she had become 
aware of due to actions by law enforcement in other countries. 
Cryptoqueen Ruja Ignatova Tipped Off About Onecoin Investigations Before She Vanished, Report
In 2019, U.S. prosecutors alleged that Schneider was the one who provided the Cryptoqueen with confidential 
police information. However, he insists that 'when the Bulgarians participated at certain Europol meetings, it only 
took hours for her to get a complete rundown and get the minutes of what was said in those meetings.' 
The Bulgarian Ministry of Interior, U.S. law enforcement bodies that took part in the March 2017 meeting, and the 
Dubai Police refrained from commenting. Europol, which said it's looking into the matter, stated that 'This complex 
scenario with many stakeholders makes it difficult to assess where and how such an incident might have occurred.'

 Three people are facing trial in Germany for their roles in one of the crypto world's most infamous scams, Onecoin. 
The defendants are accused of fraud, among other crimes, allegedly committed as they assisted the pyramid 
scheme's mastermind, 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova, who is still on the run.  
Lawyer and Couple Face Criminal Allegations in Germany Over Roles in Onecoin Scam 
A husband and wife as well as an attorney from Munich are now among the first people in Europe to face criminal 
charges over their participation in the Onecoin crypto scam. On Tuesday, they appeared in a German court, 
Bloomberg reported. 
The three have been accused of money laundering, fraud, and banking crimes linked to the multibillion-dollar fraud 
scheme. The pyramid was founded and managed by Bulgarian-born German national Ruja Ignatova, dubbed the 
'Cryptoqueen.' 
The lawyer allegedly transferred €20 million ($19.7 million) to the Cayman Islands on behalf of Ignatova for the 
purchase of two London apartments for €75 million euros. The couple are charged with handling €320 million in 
payments from Onecoin customers within a year. 
The German indictment points out that the pyramid defrauded people by falsely claiming that Onecoin was a 
cryptocurrency with market-determined value. Investors were also told that it could be mined at a rate of 50,000 
coins per minute. In the court room, prosecutors explained: 
In reality, the ever-growing value was a fake and the mining process was only simulated by the software. 
Cryptoqueen Ruja Still Missing, Wanted by Europe and America 
Onecoin was established in 2014 and had an office in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, which was raided[1] by law 
enforcement after Ruja Ignatova's disappearance. The Cryptoqueen was last seen boarding a Ryanair flight bound 
for Athens on Oct. 25, 2017. 
Ignatova is now wanted by Interpol, Europol[2], and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI[3]) for 
misappropriating at least $4 billion from Onecoin clients. In July, Greek media revealed[4] that the Hellenic Police 
had unsuccessfully tried to locate and arrest her this year, acting on information that she met with specific persons. 
After Ignatova vanished from the public eye in late 2017, her brother Konstantin Ignatov took over, but he was later 
arrested in Los Angeles in 2019. Konstantin pleaded guilty and sought witness protection. In the U.S., Ignatova has 
been charged with wire and securities fraud as well as money laundering. 
Onecoin Cryptoqueen Associates Appear in German Court
In August, news came out that a British national accused of money laundering and wire fraud related to the Onecoin 
scam, Christopher Hamilton, had lost his bid to avoid extradition to the United States and would be handed over to 
U.S. authorities. 
At some point, the crypto pyramid claimed to have more than 3 million members around the world, generating some 
€3.4 billion euros in revenue in less than two years of operation as a multilevel marketing network, between late 
2014 and the third quarter of 2016.

Oct 14, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair (RYAAY) shares soared 5% in the last trading session to close at $59.76. The move was backed by solid 
volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 17.2% loss 
over the past four weeks. 
The uptick in RYAAY shares was part of a broader rally by European airline stocks on Oct 13. The rally was owing 
to encouraging forecasts from Intercontinental Consolidated Airline Group and easyJet plc as air-travel demand 
bounces back strongly from the pandemic lows. Per easyJet's CEO Johan Lundgren "easyJet achieved a record 
bounce back this summer with Q4 operating profit expected to be between 525m and 545m and passenger 
numbers almost doubling versus last summer to 24 million with a load factor of 92%, as demand for our leading 
network and services remains strong,' Intercontinental Consolidated Airline Group expects operating profit for the 
third quarter to be around EUR1.2 billion driven by high passenger revenues. 
RYAAY is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-
over-year change of +394%. Revenues are expected to be $4.02 billion, up 91.3% from the year-ago quarter. 
While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, 
empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock 
price movements. 
For Ryanair, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a 
stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, 
make sure to keep an eye on RYAAY going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the 
road. 
The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy) stocks here  > > > >[1] 
Ryanair is a member of the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry. One other stock in the same industry, Frontier 
Group Holdings (ULCC), finished the last trading session 2.2% lower at $9.25. ULCC has returned -25.7% over the 
past month. 
For Frontier Group, the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed +29% over the past month 
to $0.10. This represents a change of +190.9% from what the company reported a year ago. Frontier Group 
currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

 Part 3 - Costs Under Pre-Action Protocols/Portals and The Digital Justice System 
Here is my response. 
RESPONSE TO CIVIL JUSTICE COUNCIL COSTS WORKING GROUP CONSULTATION PAPER - JUNE 2022 
Part 3 - Costs Under Pre-Action Protocols/Portals and The Digital Justice System 
3.1 What are the implications for costs associated with civil justice of the digitisation of dispute resolution? 
Digitisation always leads to an increase in costs, as effectively the work has to be done twice, that is taking the 
information and then uploading it. 
There are also significant extra costs in terms of maintaining the relevant software etc. 
3.2 What is the impact on costs of pre-action protocols and portals? 
3.3 Is there a need to reform the processes of assessing costs when a claim settles before issue, including both 
solicitor own client costs, and party and party costs? 
3.4 What purpose(s) does the current distinction between contentious business and non-contentious business 
serve? Should it be retained? 
I can deal with these together. 
A key issue concerns assessing costs before court proceedings begin, and a recognition that in an age of portals, 
protocols and digital justice, whatever that means, there is not such an obvious point where the Rubicon is crossed, 
and proceedings are issued. 
For example, in the existing portal system for personal injury work, do proceedings begin when: 
i. The Claim Notification Form is lodged on the portal; or 
ii. when Stage 3 is engaged, and a court fee paid; or 
iii. only when the matter drops out of the process and substantive Part 7 proceedings are issued? 
Pre-issue work is non-contentious, but becomes retrospectively contentious once proceedings are issued, which is 
why in a matter settled pre-issue there needs to be a contractual provision for costs, e.g.: 
'The defendant will pay the claimant's reasonable costs to be assessed if not agreed.' 
CIVIL JUSTICE COUNCIL COSTS WORKING GROUP CONSULTATION PAPER - JUNE 2022 - DEADLINE 
12 NOON TODAY
What is, or is not, contentious, or a dispute, was considered recently by the Supreme Court in 
Bott & Co Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2022] UKSC 8 (16 March 2022)[1] 
and remains to be ruled upon by the Court of Appeal in the seemingly endless saga of 
Belsner v Cam Legal Services Ltd [2020] EWHC 2755 (QB)[2]  
In the absence of an entitlement to costs pre-issue, there is an incentive to issue, which goes against current 
Government and Judicial thinking, partly, or even mainly, because of the shortage of judges and resources. 
That is a different issue from the desirability of certainty in relation to costs where matters are resolved through a 
quasi-Judicial pre-issue portal process. 
Both the existing personal injury pre-action process, and the general civil litigation fixed recoverable costs scheme 
from April 2023, provide an entitlement to fixed costs where the matter is settled pre-issue. 
However, there is a fundamental difference between personal injury work and other civil litigation, in that Qualified 
One-Way Costs Shifting means that an unsuccessful personal injury claimant generally does not pay the successful 
defendant's costs. 
In general civil litigation they do. Creating that liability pre-issue means that a putative claimant who does not go 
ahead with the claim is liable for the un-sued defendant's costs. 
Let us take an example. 
It is April 2023. Charlie Claimant writes the email from hell to Denise Defendant claiming 100,000 and saying that it 
is a Band 4 case with maximum fixed recoverable costs. 
Denise Defendant politely tells Charlie Claimant to go away and no further action is taken. 
Under the new system the putative claimant has to pay the un-sued defendant 16,000 (see page 106 of Lord 
Justice Jackson's Supplemental Report: Fixed Recoverable Costs). 
That will come as a shock to some of the more aggressive litigators and their clients, and it throws up many issues. 
When does liability crystalize? 
In issued proceedings it would be on defeat, or on Notice of Discontinuance. Is there to be a form of pre-action 
strike out, so that if no action is taken for three months or whatever, then the inactive claimant becomes liable for 
costs? 
Can a claimant keep it jogging along - at no extra costs as they are fixed - for the six-year limitation period? 
What about a Litigant in Person who writes an email with it never occurring to them that they are thus engaging in a 
cost bearing litigation process? 
Where does the system draw a line between, at one end, a mild Letter of Complaint, and at the other a full-blown 
Letter before Action? 
The risk is that a digital process will be seen as a form of litigation and have the consequences of deterring parties 
from engaging and thus have exactly the opposite of the intended effect. 
Small businesses in particular are concerned about this. 
At the Civil Justice Council meeting there was a general view that there should be pre-issue costs liability, but no 
consensus on where to draw the line. 
Whatever happens, it is hard now to justify the distinction between contentious and non-contentious business, and 
surely it is time that these terms were scrapped. 
Likewise, the indemnity principle, which in any event has no application in fixed recoverable costs cases - see 
Butt v Nizami [2006] EWHC 159 (QB)[3] 
The related matters of costs under pre-action protocols and portals and the digital justice system on the one hand, 
and fixed recoverable costs for pre-issue work whether the matter becomes issued or not, are of great importance if 
the desire is to have matters settled pre-issue. 
At present there are more questions than answers.

 'Even the tyrant never rules by force alone,' wrote G. K. Chesterton, 'but mostly by fairy tales.' 
Alexander Lukashenko meets Chesterton's description perfectly. Since 1994, he has kept himself in power as 
President of Belarus by stealing elections, mugging the press, and serving as Vladimir Putin's most loyal stooge in 
Eastern Europe. In May 2021, he even forced a Ryanair jet en route from Greece to Lithuania to land in his capital 
of Minsk[1] so he could arrest a leading dissident on board, Roman Protasevich. The least free nation in all of 
Europe, Belarus is cursed with a horrific human rights record thanks to the blood-soaked hands of its maniacal 
dictator. 
The fairy tale side of Lukashenko is legendary. He boasts a fondness for the old Soviet Union, whose collapse he 
labeled 'a disaster.' He champions state ownership of industry because he says it's efficient, which not even the 
most moronic fairy tale would dare claim. 
Last week brought news from Minsk that Lukashenko fancies himself a sort of economic sorcerer. Facing an annual 
rate of price inflation of nearly 20 percent, he angrily declared at a meeting of top officials, 'All price increases are 
forbidden. Forbidden! From today [October 6]. Not from tomorrow, from today!' 
At least for a moment, every dictator who prints paper money, stifles wealth creation, and wonders why prices 
subsequently rise must have thought, 'Now why didn't I think of that?' 
A year from now, you can bet your life that no headline in the world will read, 'Lukashenko's Decree Miraculously 
Ends Inflation, All is Well in the Belarusian Economy.' The 9.5 million people of Belarus are about to experience the 
same painful outcome that price controls produce always and everywhere. Lukashenko's fairy tale will be their 
nightmare. 
If I could place just one book in the hands of every Belarusian today, it would be a classic from 1979 by Robert L. 
Schuettinger and Eamonn F. Butler titled Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls: How Not to Fight Inflation[2]. 
In his Foreword to the book, David I. Meiselman underscores the verdict that Schuettinger and Butler definitively 
provide in chapter after chapter: 
The experience under price controls is as vast as essentially all recorded history, which gives us an unparalleled 
opportunity to explore what price controls do and do not accomplish. I know of no other economic and public policy 
Lukashenko's Mad Attempt to 'Forbid' Prices From Rising Is a Movie We've Seen Before
measure whose efforts have been tested over such diverse historical experience in different times, places, peoples, 
modes of government and systems of economic organization 
The historical record is a grimly uniform sequence of repeated failure. Indeed, there is not a single episode where 
price controls have worked to stop inflation or cure shortages 
Many of the results of price controls, such as black and gray markets, are predictable and have the inevitability of 
mathematics and of many of the laws of the physical sciences. Nations that ignore them are no less periled than 
those that decree that two plus two must equal three. 
Market prices are what they are because of a confluence of factors, chief of which are the supply of and demand for 
goods on the one hand, and the supply of and demand for money on the other. Prices send signals to both 
consumers and producers, telling them what and how much to produce as well as what and how much to consume. 
When prices are free to move, they act to bring supply and demand together so surpluses and shortages are 
ephemeral. When a tyrant simply decrees what prices will be, and enforces his order at gunpoint, it's mindless to 
think that everyone will live happily ever after. 
According to Schuettinger and Butler, the Babylonian king Hammurabi 'smothered economic progress' with wage 
and price controls in 1750 B.C. Trade declined, and 'the very people who were supposed to benefit' from the 
restrictions 'were driven out of the market.' 
For a time in ancient Greece, merchants were put to death for violating price controls, a fact which prevented them 
permanently from ever moderating price increases by adding to the supply of goods. 'The Athenian government,' 
reported Schuettinger and Butler, even 'went so far as to execute its own inspectors when their price-enforcing zeal 
flagged.' Inflation didn't disappear as effectively as either the merchants or inspectors did. 
Similar results occurred later in the Roman Empire. Diocletian's famous price-fixing Edict of 301 ended in 
unmitigated disaster and the emperor's abdication. Quoting Livy, the authors of Forty Centuries note that 'State 
intervention and a crushing fiscal policy made the whole empire groan under the yoke; more than once, both poor 
men and rich prayed that the barbarians would deliver them from it.' 
Printing paper money while declaring it to be 'backed' by confiscated Catholic Church properties didn't save the 
French Revolution in the 1790s. Even with the guillotine working overtime to enforce the 'Law of the Maximum,' 
inflation raged, shortages and black markets mushroomed, and the French economy shriveled until Napoleon came 
to power and burned the printing presses. 
The historical examples of price control failure are almost endless, and Belarus will soon join the sorry list. 
Why is knowing economics and history important? Because without the knowledge these disciplines give us, we 
can be as stupid and as destructive as a Belarusian despot. And that's no fairy tale.

 In the past week, Allegiant Travel ALGT[1] updated its projections for the September quarter, taking into account 
the likely impact of Hurricane Ian. With air-travel demand rebounding from the pandemic lows, Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[2] transported 13% more passengers in September than three years ago. 
Again, owing to the favorable air-travel demand scenario, consolidated traffic at Gol Linhas GOL[3] increased 
41.4% in September from the year-ago level. The proposed merger between JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] and Spirit 
Airlines SAVE[5] got the support of two prominent proxy firms. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6] Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. ALGT now expects third-quarter 2022 
operating revenues to increase 27.5% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier outlook hinted at growth of 29%). 
Per Drew Wells, senior vice president, revenues at Allegiant, 'The impacts from Hurricane Ian have resulted in the 
cancellation of the majority of our flights touching Florida over the course of the next few days. Although the 
situation is still developing, we believe the impacts from Ian will bring down our revenue guide by 1.5 percentage 
points." Total system capacity (measured in available seat miles) for the September quarter is anticipated to rise 
14.5% from the level reported three years ago (earlier outlook hinted at 16% approximate growth). Scheduled 
service capacity for the September quarter is now anticipated to rise roughly 17% from the third-quarter 2019 
actuals (earlier outlook hinted at growth of nearly 18%). 
Cost per available seat miles (excluding fuel) is now expected to increase in the 13-14% range from the third-
quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance called for a 10% increase). Fuel cost per gallon is now expected to be $3.87 
per gallon[7] (earlier guidance: $3.80). 
2. In September, RYAAY's passenger volume was a robust 15.9 million compared with 10.6 million a year ago. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 94% in September 2022 compared with 81% a year ago. Ryanair 
aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
3. In September, Gol Linhas' consolidated load factor improved 2.6 percentage points to 81.7% with traffic growth 
outpacing the capacity expansion of 36.9% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to a 
rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In September, domestic traffic and capacity improved 27% and 23%, 
respectively. On the domestic front, 27.9% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in September 2022. Domestic 
load factor was 81.7%. The volume of departures and seats increased 24.5% and 24%, respectively. 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Q3 Revenue View Down, Sep Traffic Upbeat at RYAAY
4. JetBlue's impending $3.8-billion takeover of Spirit Airlines was backed by two independent proxy advisory firms, 
namely Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Company. The firms recommended that shareholders 
of SAVE vote in favor of the deal at its special meeting on Oct 19. Expressing delight at winning their backing, 
SAVE's president and CEO Ted Christie said, 'We appreciate that both of the leading proxy advisory firms 
recognize the merger agreement with JetBlue is the best path forward for Spirit, creating significant value for our 
stockholders and enhancing our ability to grow and compete with the dominant U.S. carriers.' Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that almost all airline stocks have traded in the green over the five trading days. The NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index has increased 8.6% to $54.53. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
plummeted 27.7%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors would keenly await the third-quarter 2022 results of 
Delta Air Lines DAL[8], scheduled to be out on Oct 13. We expect strong air-travel demand to have aided the top-
line performance of DAL. However, high fuel costs are likely to have dented its bottom line. 
Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Delta this time around. The combination of a positive 
Earnings ESP[9] and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. 
However, this is not the case here. Delta presently has an Earnings ESP of -2.50% (the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
is pegged at $1.57 while the Most Accurate Estimate is currently 4 cents lower) and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[10].

 This Little-Known Semiconductor Stock Could Be Your Portfolio's Hedge Against Inflation 
 Everyone uses semiconductors. But only a small number of people know what they are and what they do. If you 
use a smartphone, computer, microwave, digital camera or refrigerator (and that's just the tip of the iceberg), you 
have a need for semiconductors. That's why their importance can't be overstated and their disruption in the supply 
chain has such a global effect. But every cloud has a silver lining. Shockwaves to the international supply chain 
from the global pandemic have unearthed a tremendous opportunity for investors. And today, Zacks' leading stock 
strategist is revealing the one semiconductor stock that stands to gain the most in a new FREE report. It's yours at 
no cost and with no obligation.  > >Yes, I Want to Help Protect My Portfolio During the Recession[12]

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is being hurt by high fuel costs. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more 
than 500% year over year in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Apart from higher fuel prices, a ramp-up in RYAAY's 
operations is pushing up total costs. Total operating expenses rose more than 100% year over year in first-quarter 
fiscal 2023, with a substantial increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. 
Labor-related woes are also hurting operations at Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Lower 
average fares also represent a headwind. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, average fares declined 4% year 
over year due to coronavirus-led woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
However, a rebound in air-travel demand following the easing of COVID-related restrictions is a huge boon for 
Ryanair. In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2022), the number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes 
were 45.5 million, up 461% year over year. Air traffic in the quarter was 9% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 92% compared with 73% a year ago. 
Continuing the trend, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August registered a record figure. In 
September too, passenger volume was a robust 15.9 million compared with 10.6 million a year ago. The traffic 
volume was 13% above the September 2019 figure (pre-coronavirus era). 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 94% in September 2022 compared with 81% a year ago. Ryanair 
aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the ZacksTransportation [2]sector areAir Lease HoldingsAL[3] 
andForward Air Corporation FWRD[4]. 
Steady growth in fleet is driving Air Lease's top line. Strong freight and cargo markets as well as improving air-travel 
demand bode well for AL. AL's efforts to reward its shareholders are encouraging. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Air Lease's 2022 earnings has been revised 9.9% upward in the past 60 days. 
AL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 29.1%. 
FWRD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
Higher volumes owing to a better freight market environment bolster Forward Air's top line. Thanks to its operational 
growth, FWRD is committed to rewarding its shareholders with dividends and share buybacks. In February, 
FWRD's board approved a 14% hike in its quarterly dividend payment, taking the total to 24 cents per share. 
High Fuel Costs Hit Ryanair ( RYAAY ), Air-Travel Demand Aids
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Forward Air's 2022 earnings has been revised 3% upward in the past 60 days. 
FWRD's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 5.6%. 
FWRD currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double" 
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

 In Austria, OMV and Ryanair have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to supply sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) at Ryanair airports across Austria, Germany, and Romania[1]. While the limited production of SAF remains a 
global aviation issue, this MoU agreement gives Ryanair unique access to purchase up to 160,000 tons (53 million 
gallons) of SAF from OMV over the next 8 years (starting in 2023). This would account for a total CO2 reduction of 
over 400,000 tons, equivalent to approx. 25,000 Ryanair flights from Dublin to Vienna.

Sep 08, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has posted buoyant traffic data for August, driven by a strong air-
travel demand scenario. Latin-American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[2] also reported August traffic numbers. Load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved at Gol, with traffic increase outpacing capacity growth. 
With air-travel demand upbeat in the United States as well, United Airlines UAL[3] upped its revenue growth 
guidance for third-quarter 2022. The carrier was also in the news after reportedly [4]threatening to end its 
operations at the New York's John F. Kennedy Airport from October if the Federal Aviation Administration does not 
approve its request to operate more flights at JFK. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.Owing to buoyant air-travel 
demand, United Airlines now anticipates total operating revenues to grow almost 12% from the September-quarter 
level of 2019. The estimate is higher than the prior expected growth rate of about 11%. UAL is seeing a steady 
recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. Recovery in business travel demand also picked up the pace. 
Against this rosy backdrop, UAL expects to be profitable in the third quarter alike the second quarter of 2022. 
United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) 
to increase around 25% in the third quarter from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (previous view: up in 24-26% band). 
Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-
sharing and special charges, is anticipated to increase roughly 16% in the September quarter from the 
corresponding 2019 levels (previous view: 16-17%). Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 
10.5% in the September quarter, higher than the prior guidance of 10%. Capacity is now expected to decrease in 
the 10-11% range (earlier guidance was for an 11% decrease). UAL now forecasts the average fuel price per gallon 
to be $3.83 in the third quarter (previous view: $3.81). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
2. In August, RYAAY flew 16.9 million passengers, the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last 
August, only 11.1 million passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor increased to 96% from 82% in 
August 2021. The number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in August 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.9 
million passengers flown in August 2019 (pre-coronavirus era).

3. In August, Gol Linhas' consolidated traffic increased 46.3% year over year. To match the increased demand 
situation, GOL is expanding its capacity. In the same month, capacity grew 43.9% year over year. Since traffic 
growth was more than capacity expansion, load factor improved 1.3 percentage points (p.p) to 81.5% last month. 
Upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to a bullish scenario on a consolidated basis. In August, domestic 
traffic and capacity improved 31.7% and 29.7%, respectively. On the domestic front, 45.1% more passengers 
boarded GOL's flights last month. 
4. Delta Air Lines DAL[6] entered into an agreement with hydrogen and biogenic-based fuel developer DG Fuels in 
an environmentally-friendly move. The deal is aimed at accelerating the production of sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF), which is currently at a nascent stage. 
Per the agreement, DG Fuels will supply Delta with 385 million gallons of unblended sustainable aviation fuel from 
2027-end. The amount will be spread equally over seven years i.e., 55 million is expected to be delivered annually 
over seven years. The usage of SAF by Delta is expected to bring down lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 75-
85% compared to the emission-reduction level of conventional jet fuel[7]. 
Delta was also in the news recently when its management announced that it will operate additional flights for CES 
2023 to Las Vegas (host of the tech event, scheduled to be held from Jan 5 to Jan 8) from 16 cities in the United 
States apart from three of its international hubs. The news was reported in detail in the previous week's write-up[8].

Sep 05, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The uptick in air-travel demand bodes well for Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1]. However, escalated fuel costs, a 
primary headwind, are limiting its bottom-line growth. Factors Favoring RYAAY The improvement in air-travel 
demand following the easing of COVID-related restrictions is a huge boon for Ryanair, which currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2022), the number of passengers who flew on 
RYAAY planes were 45.5 million, up 461% year over year. Air traffic in the quarter was 9% more than the pre-
COVID levels. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 92% compared with 73% a year ago. 
Continuing the trend, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August registered a record figure. In 
fact, this was the fourth successive month wherein passenger volume touched the maximum at RYAAY. 
In August 2022, RYAAY flew 16.9 million passengers compared with 11.1 million passengers transported by 
RYAAY last August. Load factor increased to 96% from 82% in August 2021. The number of passengers attracted 
by RYAAY in August 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.9 million passengers flown in August 2019 (pre-
coronavirus era). Ryanair aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the 
pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. Efforts to 
lower its debt levels are commendable too. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.4 billion at the end of the first quarter 
of fiscal 2023 from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Key Risks Escalating fuel costs pose 
a threat to Ryan Air's bottom line. In the fiscal first quarter, operating costs surged 250% year over year, induced by 
a 560% increase in fuel expenses. Moreover, low average fares amid coronavirus concerns might hurt the airline's 
top line. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, average fares at RYAAY declined 4% year over year due to 
coronavirus-led woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the 
ZacksTransportation [2]sector areSkyWestSKYW[3],GATX CorporationGATX[4] andC.H. RobinsonCHRW[5] . 
Continued recovery in air-travel demand bodes well for SkyWest. With better air-travel demand, SKYW carried 
32.7% more passengers in first-half 2022 than the year-ago level. As a result, the passenger load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) expanded 1450 basis points to 82.1% in first-half 2022. 
SKYW's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable as well. The bullishness surrounding the stock is evident 
from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised above 100% upward over the past 60 
days. SkyWest has aMomentum Style Score[6]of B. SKYW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
Here's Why You Should Keep Ryanair ( RYAAY ) in Your Portfolio
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7]. 
Based in Chicago, IL, GATX is a global railcar lessor with owned fleets in North America, Europe and Asia. 
Improvement in the North American railcar leasing market is expected to continue driving its growth. 
Shares of GATX have gained 6% in a year's time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX's 2022 earnings has 
been revised 2.1% upward in the past 60 days. GATX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
C.H. Robinson is being aided by an improving freight scenario in the United States. Efforts to control costs also 
bode well. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill confidence in the stock further. 
CHRW has a pleasant earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of 
the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining one). The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 17.6% upward over the past 60 days. C.H. Robinson currently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2.

 Sibiu International Airport will open six new routes in the next period, with state aid worth over 2.2 million euros, the 
contribution being over 370,000 euros per route, over a period of three years, according to a decision adopted 
unanimously by the county councilors on Thursday."The maximum budget of the state aid scheme is EUR 
2,234,485.44, and the maximum contribution is EUR 372,414.24 per route for a period of three years. 
The state aid scheme will be valid until December 31, 2025, the date by which the Sibiu County Council and the 
Sibiu International Airport Autonomous Corporation will conclude financial aid contracts with the beneficiaries, 
based on a bid selection procedure to select the beneficiaries, until the scheme's budget is exhausted, and the 
subsidy can be paid until the end of 2028. The maximum number of potential beneficiaries of the scheme is six, 
considering the fact that the budget of the scheme was estimated taking as a reference a number of six new 
routes," the decision reads.Currently, the network of routes available from Sibiu International Airport directly 
connects the city of Sibiu with 18 destinations: Munich (flights operated by Lufthansa), Vienna (flights operated by 
Austrian Airlines), Stuttgart (flights operated by Blue Air), Dortmund, Frankfurt Hahn, Karlsruhe Baden-Baden, 
London Luton, Madrid, Memmingen, Nurnberg (flights operated by Wizz Air), Billund, Bologna, Brussels Charleroi, 
Corfu, Dublin, Liverpool, Milan Malpensa, Venice Treviso and Vienna (flights operated by Ryanair)."It is estimated 
that a number of 2,875,000 people live in the extended catchment area of the Sibiu airport, located at a maximum of 
120 minutes from the Sibiu airport, the market share that can be attracted by it is 1,311,000 inhabitants, 46% of the 
maximum potential," it is shown in the specialist report on the grounds of which the state aid for opening new routes 
at the Sibiu International Airport was granted.

Spanish strikes affect Iberia Express, easyJet , and Ryanair
Spanish strikes affect Iberia Express, easyJet, and Ryanair

 Air passengers in Spain are being tested as they have to accommodate strikes from easyJet and Iberia Express 
since this weekend, while Ryanair will be affected (again) next week. All strikes are organized by unions that call for 
higher salaries in the new collective agreements that are currently being negotiated. Spanish strikes affect Iberia 
Express, easyJet, and Ryanair. 
easyJet[1] has been affected by multiple strikes from pilot union Sepla, which has been demanding that the airline 
restores their working conditions and salaries to pre-pandemic levels, especially as the carrier benefits from a 
strong recovery. Talks have been ongoing for six months without success, resulting in the first strikes in July. From 
August 12-14, the pilot union also went on strike and again from August 27 until today, August 29. Affected are 
easyJet's bases in Barcelona, Malaga, and Palma de Mallorca. In July, the cabin crew also threatened to go on 
strike, but this was averted afterunion USO[2] reached an agreement. 
Iberia Express strike until September 6 
The same Union Sindical Obrera is now organizing a cabin crew strike at Iberia Express[3], which started on 
Sunday and will last until and including Tuesday, September 6. 'We demand decent wage conditions because we 
have frozen wages since 2015. We have parked the bulk of the demands for later and we have asked the company 
to update wages by 6.5 percent, in accordance with the CPI of 2021, to call off the strike. But Iberia Express does 
not agree and has asked us to call off in exchange for nothing', USO delegate Rubn Ramos said on Sunday in a 
media statement of the union. 
The strike led to the cancelation of eight flights on Sunday from Madrid to Gran Canaria, Palma de Mallorca, 
Sevilla, and Santiago. Iberia Express said that most passengers had been booked on other flights or given a 
voucher or a refund. Today, the strike affects ten flights, six on Tuesday, and eight each day from Wednesday until 
the final day on Tuesday next week. The airline said that it would be able to operate 94 flights or 90.4 percent of all 
flights today. 
The list of canceled flights includes only services that aren't protected by so-called Minimum Services by the 
Ministry of Transport. This sparked outrage in the union, with Ruben Ramos saying: 'The company is playing a dirty 
strategy, it is canceling all flights not protected by the minimum services, preventing crews from exercising their 
right to strike.'  
Spanish strikes affect Iberia Express, easyJet , and Ryanair
USO said it has filed a complaint against Iberia Express with the Spanish labor inspectorate for coercing cabin crew 
and asking them by email if they support the strike. The union also complains about the deprogramming of Express 
cabin crew on services out of London to European destinations, replacing Spanish crew with those of partner airline 
British Airways. 'This is yet another case of scabbing as striking workers are replaced for fear that they will decide 
to exercise their right and some of these flights will be canceled', USO says in its statement. 
In its own media statement, Iberia Express called on 'the responsibility of USO, the union that called for the strike, 
to call off the strikes and bet on dialogue and not on the social confrontation, which does so much damage to the 
workers of Iberia Express, its customers and the future of the company.'Parent airline Iberia[4] has scheduled 
negotiations on a new, multi-year collective agreement for September 15. The airline says that after two years of 
Covid crisis, it has incurred significant losses of €1.8 billion and has to repay €1.0 billion in debt. While 
acknowledging that all workers have also been hit hard by the effects of the pandemic and action must be taken, it 
calls on unions to take responsibility. 
Ryanair 
From September 5, USO has scheduled another four-day strike withRyanair[5] in Spain. This follows a strike in mid-
August. The union said in an August 19 media release that at the time eighteen workers had been dismissed by 
Ryanair, while disciplinary action had been taken against some 150 staff. USO has filed lawsuits against the Irish 
low-cost airline to fight the dismissal, which it says is against the constitutional right to strike.  
The airline also flew in crew from Ireland to take over from their Spanish colleagues, which are left on duty. 'Ryanair 
is using totally illegal techniques and weapons such as scabbing to make it seem that this strike is not supported by 
the workers, sanctioning and dismissing crew members for exercising this constitutional right,' USO delegate Lidia 
Arasanz is quoted. It has filed complaints over scabbing with the Spanish labor inspectorate.

 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] was the chief newsmaker following its decision to increase the 
projection for the number of passengers to be transported in fiscal 2023 (ending Mar 31, 2023). American Airlines 
AAL[2] was also in the news, courtesy of its management's decision to expand its regional operations. To this end, 
AAL inked a five-year deal with Air Wisconsin. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] reportedly[4] announced some 
route cuts to ensure operational efficiency. 
AAL also grabbed the headlines recently when it inked a deal with Boom Supersonic to purchase up to 20 Overture 
planes from the latter. The story was reported in detail in the previous week's write-up[5]. Recap of the Latest Top 
Stories 1. Ryanair now expects passenger volumes for fiscal 2023 to be 166.5 million. The previous expectation 
was 165 million. Ryanair augmented its UK capacity by adding one million plus seats to/from 20 airports in the UK. 
The raised forecast is owing to management's decision to boost the airline's UK winter schedule following a 
reduction in the winter schedule capacity of its rival British Airways[6]. RYAAY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
2. With an eye on maintaining its operations to small markets, American Airlines announced that Air Wisconsin will 
be part of the American Eagle family by March 2023 in the face of acute pilot crisis. Air Wisconsin's fleet will start 
operating for American Eagle within next March. American Eagle is a network of multiple regional carriers that 
operate under a codeshare and service pact with AAL. 
Per the terms of the deal, Air Wisconsin will be responsible for operating up to 60 aircraft of its fleet of 50-seat CRJ-
200s, primarily from AAL's hub at the Chicago - O'Hare International. Currently, Air Wisconsin operates flights for 
United Airlines UAL[8] from the latter's (Chicago-based carrier) hubs at O'Hare and Dulles International Airports. Air 
Wisconsin's partnership with UAL is likely to come to an end, in accordance with its terms.[9] 
3. Management at JetBlue decided to trim its network by terminating services to some destinations. To this end, 
JBLU decided to stop its nonstop flights from San Francisco International Airport to Newark after Sep 6, 2022. Per a 
statement issued by the management, 'To ensure continued operational reliability, we're planning a schedule 
change for this fall and into 2023 that will extend some of the market suspensions we put in place earlier this year,' 
4. Per a CNBC report[10], the U.S. administration decided to suspend 26 flights to China from the United States by 
four Chinese carriers, namely Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. The decision, 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Solid FY23 Traffic View, AAL 's Deal & More
which will impact flights from Sep 5 to Sep 28, follows a similar ruling from the Chinese government, whereby 26 
U.S.-bound flights by Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines were suspended due to COVID-19 cases.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] expects to fly more passengers than previously estimated in fiscal 2023 (endingMar 
31, 2023). The raised forecast is owing to the management's decision to boost the airline's UK winter schedule 
following a reduction in the winter schedule capacity of its rival British Airways. 
Per a Reuters report[2], Ryanair now expects passenger volumes for fiscal 2023 to be 166.5 million. The previous 
expectation was 165 million. Ryanair augmented its UK capacity by adding above one million seats to/from 20 
airports in the UK. 
Management of British Airways decided to cancel some flights until Oct 31, 2022. This came after the 
announcement that Heathrow airport will slash capacity to combat widespread operational disruption. Ryanair, 
however, does not fly from Heathrow. 
Many European carriers, like their U.S. counterparts, have been struggling for a while to tackle the buoyant air-
travel demand scenario in the post-lockdown era due to staff shortage. 
Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been aided by upbeat air traffic. In July, RYAAY flew 16.8 
million passengers, the highest ever traffic volume at the carrier in the said month. Last July, only 9.3 million 
passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased to 96% from 80% 
in July 2021. The number of passengers ferried by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million 
passengers flown in July 2019 (pre-coronavirus era).

 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] posted upbeat traffic data for the month of July, driven by the 
buoyant air-travel demand scenario. Latin-American carrier, Gol Linhas GOL[2] also reported July traffic numbers. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined at Gol with capacity growth outpacing traffic increase. 
Another Latin American carrier Copa Holdings CPA[3] reported better-than-expected earnings per share for 
second-quarter 2022 driven by higher revenues.With the earnings season in full swing, second-quarter results of 
many airline companies were reported in detail in the previous week's write up[4]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 
In July, RYAAY flew 16.8 million passengers, the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last July, 
only 9.3 million passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor increased to 96% from 80% in July 2021. The 
number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million passengers flown 
in July 2019 (pre-coronavirus era). July performance was recorded despite some of Ryanair's cabin crew staff in 
certain European countries being on strike. RYAAY operated more than 92,000 flights in July[5]. The stock currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. In July, Gol Linhas' consolidated traffic increased 36.3% year over year. To match the increased demand 
situation, GOL is expanding its capacity. In the same month, capacity grew 42.6% year over year. Since traffic 
growth was less than capacity expansion, load factor declined 3.7 percentage points (p.p) to 80.8% last month. 
Upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to arosyscenario on a consolidated basis. In July, domestic traffic 
and capacity improved 24.1% and 31%, respectively. On the domestic front, 29.9% more passengers boarded 
GOL's flights in July 2022. 
3. Copa Holdings reported second-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding $2.69 from non-recurring items) of 32 cents 
per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. In the year-ago quarter, CPA had incurred 
a loss of 38 cents per share due to coronavirus-led depressed air-travel demand. Quarterly revenues of $693.4 
million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674.5 million and rose significantly year over year , courtesy 
ofimproved air-travel demand. 
Below, we present all comparisons (in % terms) with second-quarter 2019 levels (pre-coronavirus). 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Solid July Traffic, CPA's Q2 Earnings Beat & More
Passenger revenues (contributed 94.7% to the top line) increased 5.9% owing to higher yields (up 10.1%). Cargo 
and mail revenues jumped 62.4% to $26.7 million, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Total revenues 
improved 20% in the reported quarter. On a consolidated basis, traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or 
RPMs) fell 3.8%. As traffic decline was more than the amount of capacity contraction (3.4%), load factor contracted 
0.4 percentage points to 84.8% in the reported quarter. Passenger revenue per available seat miles increased 9.6% 
to 11 cents. Additionally, revenue per available seat mile (RASM) increased 11. 3% to 11.6 cents. Cost per 
available seat mile (CASM) increased 19.9%. Excluding fuel, the metric dipped 4.6%. Average fuel price per liter 
soared 86.1% to $4.14. 
Total operating expenses increased 15.8% to $651.1 million due to the 67% increase in fuel costs. Expenses on 
wages, salaries and other employee benefits fell 17.9% on reduced headcount. Sales and distribution costs 
increased 9.6% due to higher sales. Passenger servicing costs dropped 37%. Flight operation costs decreased 
5.4%. 
Copa Holdings exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $134.1 million compared with $211.08 
million at the end of December 2021. Total debt, including lease liabilities, was $1.6 billion at the end of the second 
quarter.CPA exited the second quarter with a consolidated fleet of 94 aircraft comprising68 Boeing 737-800s, 17 
Boeing 737 MAX 9s,and nine Boeing 737-700s. During the second quarter, the carrier took delivery of one Boeing 
737 MAX 9 aircraft. 
Due to escalating fuel prices, among other factors, Copa Holdings expects third-quarter operating margin in the 16-
18% range. CPA expects capacity to be 6.4 billion, equivalent to 100% of the third-quarter 2019 capacity. Load 
factor is estimated to be around 86% in the September quarter. Fuel price is estimated to be $3.80 per gallon. 
For the full year, CPA expects capacity to reach approximately 98% of the 2019 level.CASM, excluding fuel, is 
anticipated to be 5.9 cents in 2022. 
4. Allegiant Travel ALGT[7] reported second-quarter 2022 loss (excluding 38 cents from non-recurring items) of 62 
cents per share, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Operating revenues of $629.8 million beat the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $629.2 million and increased 33.2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk (94.1%) of the top line, soared 33.5% on a year-over-year basis. 
The upside can be attributed to improvement in air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles 
or RPMs) for scheduled service surged 33.9% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat 
miles or ASMs) also increased 8.5% year over year. Load factor increased 1650 basis points to 87.3% in the 
reported quarter, as traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion.  
Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, escalated 42.2% year over year to 6.94 cents. 
Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up in excess of 100% to $4.33 in the quarter. Total scheduled service 
passenger revenue per available seat miles rose 22.5% to 12.69 cents. ALGT exited the June quarter with 115 
planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2022 is expected to be 124. 
For third-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon is expected to be $3.80. Total operating revenues are likely to increase 
29% from third-quarter 2019 actuals. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to increase approximately 10%. Capacity for 
scheduled service and total system are likely to increase 18% and 16%, respectively, from third-quarter 2019 
actuals. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] had a good run on the bourses on Aug 3, gaining 2.9% from Aug 2's 
closing. As a result of this uptick, the stock closed yesterday's trading at $73.60. Why the Uptick? The highly 
impressive July traffic numbers led to the stock price gain on Aug 3. The carrier flew 16.8 million passengers in the 
month, the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last July, only 9.3 million passengers were 
transported by RYAAY. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased to 96% from 80% in July 2021. The number of passengers 
attracted by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million passengers flown in July 2019 (pre-
coronavirus era). July performance was recorded despite some of Ryanair's cabin crew staff in certain European 
countries being on strike. RYAAY operated more than 92,000 flights in July. 
Ryanair has been benefiting from improved traffic owing to upbeat air-travel demand for quite some time as COVID-
19 restrictions are relaxed. In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2022), RYAAY's revenues surged 602% year 
over year to €2.6 billion on the back of buoyant traffic. Scheduled revenues in the fiscal first quarter increased 720% 
to €1.58 billion. 
The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 45.5 million in the quarter, up 461% year over year. 
The traffic was 9% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-quarter fiscal 2023 was 92% compared with 
73% a year ago. Zacks Rank Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the 
broader Zacks Transportation [2]sector are Star Bulk Carriers SBLK[3] and C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[4] , 
each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here.[5] 
Star Bulk's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and 
missed once, the average surprise being 7.1%. 
Shares of Star Bulk have gained more than 27% in a year's time. Improvement in economic activities is aiding the 
SBLK stock. 
C.H. Robinson has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.9% for the current year. CHRW delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 24.2%, on average. 
C.H. Robinson has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. Shares of CHRW have gained 21% over the past 
year.

 Bucharest Aurel Vlaicu International Airport (Baneasa) reopened on Monday, August 1, on the occasion of the 
110th anniversary of its inauguration, manager of Bucharest Airports Company, George Dorobantu said. 
The airport has gone through a program of modernization of airport buildings and equipment in recent years. Three 
airline companies are already ready to start scheduled and charter flights on Baneasa. 'We already have three 
advanced discussions at the stage of signing contracts to operate from Baneasa. It is about Ryanair which is 
looking for solutions to increase its aircraft base in Romania, they will operate two flights from the autumn or winter 
season, Air Connect which announced its intention to operate also from Baneasa, currently they are authorized for 
Otopeni but will also operate at Baneasa, for flights with short distance ATR aircraft. There is another company 
registered in the Republic of Moldova, Fly One for charter flights, Baneasa-Chisinau,' said Dorobantu, who resigned 
from the position of manager of Bucharest Airports Company. Unlike Otopeni Airport where passengers must arrive 
at least two hours before boarding, at Baneasa the time will be less than an hour. Also on Monday, August 1, 2022, 
an event is scheduled to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the establishment of B?neasa Airport, considered the 
third oldest airport in the world still in operation. Baneasa Airport was inaugurated in 1920, but its history begins on 
August 1, 1912, when the Romanian Air League, led by Prince George Valentin Bibescu, established a piloting 
school for military pilots in Baneasa.

 Ukrainian activists have criticised aviation companies for buying billions of pounds worth of jet fuel from Russia 
since Vladimir Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea. 
Last year, British Airways owner IAG spent an estimated 13.4 million on Russian-sourced kerosene, according to a 
new analysis[1] of Europe's ten largest airline companies. 
IAG - which also owns Spanish and Irish carriers Iberia and Aer Lingus - used 586 barrels of Russian jet fuel per 
day in 2021, spending the equivalent of 36,903 per day. 
The sum was nearly double the next biggest spender, Scandinavian airline SAS, which spent an estimated 7.1 
million, according to calculations by data specialists Zero Carbon Analytics.. 
In total, the ten airline companies spent an estimated 4.1 billion on Russian jet fuel since Putin's 2014 annexation of 
Crimea. This includes 850 million in 2019 alone, before sales dropped during the Covid pandemic. 
Russia's escalation of its war on Ukraine in February has contributed to a spike in energy prices and sparked efforts 
to move away from Russian fossil fuels across Europe. 
The analysis does not cover purchasing in 2022. No airline companies responded when asked by DeSmog whether 
they still source from Russia. 
Svitlana Romanko, coordinator of Stand With Ukraine[2], which campaigns against Russian fossil fuel imports to 
Europe, said: 'The research has made clear that as of the end of 2021, British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines and 
other air flight providers were still buying aviation fuel from Russia.' 
She called on airlines to disclose where they are currently sourcing their jet fuel, adding: 'No one should buy 
Russian oil, gas and coal and feed Putin's war machine, otherwise the whole world will face a bleak, dictatorial 
future devoid of freedom, security and choice.' 
Ukrainian Boycott Call 
The UK has pledged[3] to stop all imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022, while the EU - where countries are 
typically more reliant on Russian energy - have agreed[4] to ban 90 percent of oil from Russia by the same 
deadline. 
There are concerns, however, that Russian oil refined in other countries, such as India, could continue to make its 
way to Europe. 
Top European Airlines Have Spent 4bn on Russian Jet Fuel Since Crimea Invasion
In March 2022, soon after the Russian invasion, Oleg Ustenko, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky, called[5] on Europeans to boycott airlines that use Russian jet fuel. 
To calculate the estimates, Zero Carbon Analytics used official national statistics on European demand for Russian 
jet fuel, average prices for each year, and the number of barrels used by each airline. 
Others in the top five for 2021 were Hungarian airline Wizz Air with 3.9 million, Swiss airline EasyJet with 3.8 
million, and Ireland's Ryanair with 3.4 million. 
In the years since the annexation of Crimea, European airlines have increased how much they spend on Russian 
jet fuel, according to the research, from 375.5 million in 2014 to nearly 850 million in 2019, the last year before the 
Covid pandemic hit the aviation industry. 
British supermarkets have also been criticised[6] for continuing to sell Russian-sourced diesel at their petrol stations 
ahead of the government-imposed deadline of the end of this year. 
UK Airports Top List 
Zero Carbon Analytics also found that London's Heathrow Airport was the biggest site of Russian jet fuel 
consumption out of any European airport in 2021, using 874 barrels per day at a cost of nearly 55,000. London's 
Gatwick Airport came fourth with 126 barrels per day. 
Between 2011 and 2021, Heathrow and Gatwick were by far the largest consumers of Russian jet fuel, accounting 
for 92 percent of European use of Russian jet fuel on average across that period, the analysis found. 
Gatwick told DeSmog that the airport doesn't use or run the fuel supply, which is managed by a consortium of fuel 
providers called GASCo - Gatwick Airport Storage Company. 
A Heathrow spokesperson said: 'We do not purchase jet fuel. Airlines source their own fuel for their aircraft. At 
Heathrow there are a number of different suppliers who provide this service to airlines.'

 Ryanair[1] ended the first quarter of its financial year 2023 with a profit, the first one since Q1 FY2020. Revenues 
soared, but the Irish low-cost isn't comfortable about how the rest of FY23 could be panning out as new Covid 
variants could push it back into a loss for the autumn and winter. Ryanair back to profit but future remains uncertain. 
Ryanair reported a €170 million net profit after tax compared to a €-272.6 million loss for the same April-June period 
last year. The operating profit was €219.6 million versus €-304.5 million last year. Total revenues soared from 
€370.5 million to €2.6 billion, of which €1.6 billion is from tickets and the rest from ancillary revenues. Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine in February damaged Ryanair's Easter bookings and has resulted in a four percent drop in 
ticket prices over Q1 2019. The group carried 45.5 million passengers, up from 8.1 million in the same period last 
year, and plans to grow to 165 million for the full year. 
Also soaring were the carrier's operating expenses, which were up to €2.4 billion from €675 million. Fuel costs were 
up to €1.0 billion from €156.6 million in Q1 FY22, but route charges, staff costs, and airport and handling costs were 
also up as Ryanair operated at higher capacity compared to last year. Actually, Ryanair and its subsidies Malta Air, 
Buzz, and Lauda Air operated at 115 percent capacity over pre-pandemic levels. 
Its business and customers suffered from 'unprecedented air traffic control and airport handling delays', affecting 
punctuality. Q2 will certainly include more about disruptions, as Ryanair suffered the effects of multiple strikes of 
cockpit and cabin crew in Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium in July. Michael O'Leary referred to the strikes as 'PR 
noise from minority unions in Spain, they are not supported by our cabin crews and pilots. In Belgium, they were 
supported by them, but remember that these strikes affected never more than one percent of our 3.000 daily flights.' 
He said that Ryanair has negotiated new agreements with unions that will restore previously agreed pay cuts. 'To 
date, accelerated pay restoration agreements have been agreed with unions representing over eighty percent of our 
pilots and approximately seventy percent of our cabin crews across Europe. We hope to conclude agreements with 
the small remaining balance in the near future.' 
Blurred visibility 
That near future has blurred visibility for the low-cost carrier. 'While there are clear signs of pent-up demand, 
bookings remain closer-in than was the norm (pre-Covid) at this time of year. We have limited visibility into the 
second half of Q2 and almost zero visibility into H2, when we are typically loss-making,' Michael O'Leary says, who 
Ryanair back to profit but future remains uncertain
warned earlier of another full-year loss. This means that even as we are already in the final week of July, the 
situation for September is unclear. In March, the carrier said that it expected reasonable profitability for FY23.[2] 
Ryanair is worried about the effects of new Covid variants and rising infections in the coming autumn and describes 
the current situation of the industry as 'fragile': 'The strength of any recovery will be hugely dependent upon there 
being no adverse or unexpected developments over the remainder of FY23.' It, therefore, is unable to give 
guidance on the rest of FY23. 
Fuel costs have been hedged this year at eighty percent, but that still leaves the airline exposed to twenty percent 
of the volatile fuel and oil costs. Still, it says it is in a significantly stronger position compared to competitors. For 
FY24, Ryanair has so far hedged thirty percent. 
Fleet 
Ryanair has taken delivery of 32 Boeing MAX 8200s this year until the end of June, bringing the fleet to 73. Another 
fifty MAX of the 210 on order are scheduled for delivery until the summer of 2023. Already last March, O'Leary said 
that he might extend the operating leases of some 737-800s to make up for the delayed MAX deliveries. He said 
today that Ryanair has reviewed the 737NG leasing options, but only announced that it has extended the lease of 
twenty Airbus A320ceo's with Lauda by four years until 2028. 
Ryanair ended the quarter with €4.6 billion in liquidity, up €1.0 billion from March, or €17 billion including assets. 
Total debt was reduced by €0.1 billion to €5.0 billion, with net debt down from €1.5 to €0.4 billion.

 BMW has quietly started selling subscriptions for heated seats[1] in a number of countries, including the UK, 
Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa. The subscription-based model for features has been available on 
BMW[2] cars for some time in countries like the UK, but the heated seat option has been added this month. In 
addition to the UK, several online publications spotted its launch in South Korea earlier this month. Customers can 
pay a monthly fee of roughly $18 to use heated seats, while the German automaker has also provided options to 
subscribe for a year at $180, three years at $300, or pay $415 for 'unlimited' access. As expected, the roll-out of the 
feature by BMW has not been publicized much fearing widespread criticism and stiff resistance from customers and 
automotive enthusiasts. 
https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-seat-2.jpg 
It was back in 2020 when BMW[3] announced its plans to launch a subscription model for many of its features. All 
those features are available via BMW's ConnectedDrive online store and can be remotely activated by the 
automaker by paying a monthly fee. Some of them can be bought permanently for a one-time cost or trialed for a 
month before purchasing on subscription. The features locked behind a paywall include the heated steering wheel 
feature that starts at $12 a month; use footage from the car's cameras with a one-time fee of $235 for 'unlimited' 
use; and the $117 'IconicSounds Sport package' that emulates different engine sounds in your car. The Bavarian 
manufacturer has argued that the subscription model can be helpful for owners who change their minds after 
purchase and want to add more features. Furthermore, BMW claims that it could prove to be very useful for those 
buying used cars 'as they now have the opportunity to add features the original owner did not choose.' 
https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-seat-3.jpg 
The likely comparison However, the idea of offering car features as a subscription has drawn severe criticism. As 
pointed out by Daily Mail[4], many irked customers have voiced their displeasure on the internet and compared 
BMW with budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet that charge an extra fee for 'everything from baggage to 
food and the right to sit with family members.' One of the dissenters wrote: 'This is the most annoying thing I have 
ever heard. If you buy a car with heated seats, you shouldn't have to pay a subscription fee to use them.' while 
another one said: 'How utterly ridiculous. Pay to have hardware installed, then pay monthly to have the software

block removed that stops you operating it!' https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-
seat-4.jpgImage - Youtube Its not just BMW BMW is not the only automaker that has rolled out or is in the process 
of launching a subscription model for certain features. Audi, Cadillac, Porsche, and Tesla are all trying out this new 
business technique to make billions of dollars. Taking a leaf from the tech world's playbook, automakers have 
recognized the subscription model as a great way to get a stream of recurring revenue for years after an initial 
purchase. And as automobiles continue to become increasingly connected to the internet, expect more 
manufacturers to jump on the bandwagon. While this will be great for the bottom line of automobile manufacturers 
that have been financially struggling due to the transition towards electrification, be prepared to shell out hundreds 
of dollars in subscription fees to use the most basic features of your car.  
https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-seat-5.jpg 
BMW stands down - BMW finally issued a clarification Friday in an attempt to pacify dissenting owners and fans. 
The statement released by the Bavarian manufacturer is addressed exclusively to its US customers. 'If a vehicle is 
initially ordered with heated seats, that option will remain fully operational for the life of the vehicle,' BMW clarified. 
'BMW Functions on Demand on the other hand is designed to offer premium features through software upload that 
use data and sensors from factory option hardware already built into BMW vehicles.' It is important to remember 
that BMW's in-vehicle subscription service, called 'Functions on Demand,' is not currently available in the US.

Jul 15, 2022( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Next week will see the official break up for all schools in the UK for the long awaited six-week summer holiday. 
However, whilst many are hoping to head abroad for their first foreign summer break since the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic, the looming summer of discontent may have other ideas. 
With airline strikes, flight cancellations, missing luggage, staff shortages and queues at nearly every UK airport, the 
summer of travel chaos will hit the UK hard, and it now seems almost impossible to avoid. Alberto Lopez 
Valenzuela, Founder & CEO, alva asks how has the UK's transport sector seemingly imploded and where will it 
end? 
Union boom 
2022 has become the year of the union boom, and nowhere does this seem truer than the UK transport sector. With 
the threat of more tube and rail strikes still rumbling on, Ryanair, easyJet and BA staff are predominantly striking 
over working conditions and pay cuts that were ordered during the height of the pandemic. 
Yet with weeks of travel chaos about to hit the UK population, it is clear at this stage that public sentiment towards 
the strikes will continue to descend as the array of different union actions continue. The knock-on effect is already 
significant damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole - damage that may take years to rebuild. 
Additionally, the travel sector will lose vital revenue, making it even harder to afford pay increases, and travellers 
and businesses will become increasingly aggravated as they take the brunt of it all. The sector is already battling 
with what seems like a different daily crisis as it struggles to stay afloat of the demands of the peak summer 
season. Heathrow has just announced a daily cap of 100,000 passengers until September 11th and up to 1,000 
more flight cancellations. It is likely other airports will follow with their own heavy-handed restrictions. 
But will the vast level of strike action that will impact almost every airport in the UK be successful or cause further 
reputational damage for all involved? There is no denying that a company's brand is tainted by issues surrounding 
workers' pay structures and working conditions. It harms corporate reputations, employee engagement and the 
crucial recruitment drive. Additionally social media will ensure that everything is played out in real life and at 
lightning speed. But with the threat of more strike action throughout the summer months, is the transport sector at 
risk of causing more reputational damage that could set it back decades? 
Communicating with passion 
Summer of travel chaos: what next?
The strike action levied by staff at the major airlines has had the major benefit of being on the front foot with 
consistent and dramatic messaging. easyJet staff in Spain want the same pay as their European counterparts - 
their strike action will still impact UK consumers as a vast majority of easyJet flights in the summer head to Spain 
daily. Meanwhile, BA's ground staff are striking over their 10% pay cut from the pandemic which has never been 
reinstated, as well as BA's controversial 'fire and rehire policy' which they say is rife. 
GMB has been scathing in the language they have used, accusing the airline of offering 'crumbs' of the money that 
was 'stolen' from hard working employees. Ryanair staff want a 'change of attitude from the airline' alongside 
guarantees of better working conditions, they have also specifically called on the Spanish government to ensure 
Ryanair does not violate labour legislation or staff's constitutional rights. 
Meanwhile, it seems the airlines have struggled to communicate with the same force and passion that their staff 
and union reps have. They have made it clear that they are against strike action and are trying to solve the issues, 
but this is a line that has lost impact as the inevitability of strike action and airport chaos has grown. 
Underlying the strike action is a wider movement created by the pandemic that has seemingly impacted the UK 
transport sector the most. The Great Resignation has created a significant shift in the employee / employer 
relationship that has left employers scrambling to retain and attract talent, not aided by the sector laying off 30,000 
skilled staff at the height of the COVID-19 crisis. 
The jobs market has been overhauled and now employee confidence is at an all-time high. New job openings have 
meant that if employees are unhappy where they work, there may be more options to move elsewhere to gain the 
pay and conditions they might expect. For this reason, employee engagement has never been more important 
within a corporate structure. 
What became clear earlier this year is that this is exactly what employees in the UK transport sector, particularly the 
aviation division, have been doing. Many were lured away by better pay, better conditions, and less stress, not just 
by rival firms but also by completely different sectors all together. The inability to compete against this backdrop has 
created a huge staff shortage not seen in modern times, and training requirements that simply couldn't be met by 
the hectic summer schedule because they couldn't persuade employees to sign on the dotted line. 
Roadmap to stability 
The UK public needs to see decisive visibility from its transport leaders, with the same passion the union reps are 
showing. They need to see communication that shows them that everything is being done to stop more strike action 
and travel upheaval - what is the roadmap out of this? More visibility is needed by the industry's leaders in coming 
forward to reassure the public that they are doing everything they can to find a solution to head off the travel chaos. 
To survive the summer of union action, the different players involved will need to adopt a secure strategy to 
manage losses, maintain productivity, crucially uphold reputation and retain the employer-employee dynamic. 
Reputationally, it's clear now that for the UK's aviation sector things could not be worse. 
The stakes are high, and the onus is on travel leaders to show that they are doing absolutely everything that they 
can to stop this continued disruption throughout 2022 - or they will face severe reputational impact for any 
indecisiveness.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] announced its plans to restart operating flights from the Belfast International Airport. 
The European carrier will be resuming operations with 12 new routes from next summer, operating 115 flights per 
week. The routes include Alicante, Faro, Barcelona Girona, Milan Bergamo and Malaga, coupled with domestic 
services to East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted and Manchester. 
Ryanair's Belfast-based fleet will include two aircraft, generating 60 aviation jobs apart from creating multiple other 
indirect vacancies at Belfast International. The move also increases the number of destinations available from the 
airport to more than 70 domestic and international ones. As a result, passengers will get more traveling choices. 
Further, George Best Belfast City Airport has announced new services to Cardiff and Southampton with Aer Lingus 
Regional, operated by Emerald Airlines. Michelle Hatfield, Corporate Services director at Belfast City Airport, said: 
'As one of the largest airline partners at Belfast City Airport, the addition of more Aer Lingus Regional services is 
fantastic for both business and leisure passengers wishing to travel to the UK." 
Per Ryanair's Management, reduced aviation taxes and competitive airport charges have encouraged them in their 
latest move to launch close to 80 weekly domestic flights to/from East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted and 
Manchester. Notably, declining aviation taxes boost traffic growth and increase connectivity. 
The latest move reflects Ryanair's growth-oriented plans over the upcoming years and should boost traffic at the 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) European carrier. Notably, shares of RYAAY have lost 33.4% year to date compared with 
23.8% loss of the industry[2] it belongs to.

Jul 08, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With labor problems hurting the U.S. airline industry, there was an encouraging update from American Airlines' 
AAL[1] CEO Robert Isom. Per the new proposal made to the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing the 
pilots, pilot pay is likely to be boosted 17% by 2024 end. European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] also 
received impressive tidings on the labor front when it reached a pay-related agreement with the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (BALPA). 
Latin American carrier Gol Linhas' GOL[3] June traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometers declined 5.5% 
from the May reading, reflecting the slowdown in air-travel demand in the country. In the latest update on the 
takeover saga of Spirit Airlines SAVE[4], management delayed its shareholders' vote on the buyout offer put 
forward by Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[5] by a week to Jul 15. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.Per the 
proposal put forward by AAL's CEO, pilots will be eligible for a pay hike of 6% on commencement of the contract 
followed by 5% raises at the start of 2023 and 2024. Moreover, if the deal gets ratified by Sep 30, 2022, there will 
be other lucrative incentives like retroactive pay. The new offer[6] is being reviewed by the union. American Airlines 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Updates on labor deals at other U.S.-based carriers were mentioned in 
the previous week's writeup[7]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. At Ryanair, the labor deal will accelerate pay restoration of pilots and ensure pay hikes post restoration through 
2026. The restoration of pay is necessary as RYAAY intends to expand capacity as much as 115% of the pre-
coronavirus levels in the current year itself to meet the demand swell. 
Per Ryanair's people director Darrell Hughes, 'While 100% of our pilots across our European network are covered 
by 2020 Emergency Agreements, we continue to work with our pilots and their unions on new deals, similar to this 
one concluded with BALPA, and have successfully re-negotiated improved long-term agreements with 70% of our 
pilots, running until 2026 or 2027 as we prioritize pay restoration.' Naturally, for this capacity expansion, it is 
imperative to keep RYAAY's group of pilots satisfied. The pay increments apart, pilots at RYAAY become eligible 
for other benefits[9]. 
3. At Gol Linhas, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat kilometers) expanded 68.6% year over year in 
June, much higher than the traffic increase of 54%. As a result of capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth, 
Airline Stock Roundup: Pay Hike Likely for AAL Pilots, GOL 's June Traffic & More
load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 7.2 percentage points to 76.7%. The domestic operations 
accounted for most of the data as international operations are still minimal. 
In the first half of the year, consolidated load factor decreased 2.5 percentage points year over year to 79.3% with 
capacity expansion (73.2%) outweighing traffic growth (67.9%). 
4. To continue talks with Frontier and another bidder JetBlue Airways JBLU[10], Spirit Airlines postponed its 
shareholders' vote, which was scheduled for today. Management at SAVE stated that the shareholders of record as 
of the close of trading on May 6, 2022, are eligible to vote at the special meeting. Both JetBlue and Frontier are 
aiming to acquire Spirit Airlines to expand their network and take advantage of the continued improvement in air-
travel demand. The takeover battle comes at a time when the airline industry is struggling with staffing and aircraft 
shortages. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that almost all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past five trading days. The 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 1.3% to $56.46. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
has plummeted 32.5%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will await further updates on the ongoing 
takeover tussle surrounding Spirit Airlines in the coming days.

Jul 07, 2022( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: https://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Society is changing rapidly, every day. We don't see it but, if you take a dip into the worlds of 1982, 1992, 2002, 
2012 and 2022, you can see the massive changes in how we live, work, relate, talk and transact. 
Back in the 1980s, no one had computers; we had rotary telephones; the main networks offered us three or four TV 
channels. The world was less connected and less informed. Travelling overseas was unusual, and travelling long-
haul unlikely for most. Most people dealt with banking in branches with passbooks and cheque books. 
In the 1990s, this changed. Many people started getting a computer in the home, a vision driven by Bill Gates. TV 
was still limited, unless you spent money on getting a chunky satellite on the top of your house. The world became 
more accessible as budget airlines launched. And the first call centre banks and, by the end of the decade, internet 
banks launched. 
In the 2000s, people were networked, the world had globalised and the world was at peace. The internet became 
the backbone of how society connected. Mobile telephones became prolific and, by the end of the decade, 
smartphones. YouTube was rapidly becoming more popular than the BBC and NBC. Hopping on and off an 
aeroplane became a no-brainer thanks to the likes of Ryanair and Southwest Airlines. And banking collapsed 
thanks to complex derivatives. Trust in banks went through the floor, laying the seeds for the rise of FinTech. 
In the 2010s, society changed again. People connected globally, but the world went back to behaving locally. Black 
Lives Matter, Greta Thunberg, David Attenborough and discussions of climate emergency, civil unrest and 
economic issues seemed to fill the news every day. Internet was now a human right, and creating your own media 
rather than consuming government media is the rage of the day. More photographs are taken every day than were 
ever taken in all of human history and jumping on a flight was like jumping on a train. FinTech and new digital 
currencies were the mainstream discussions, and banks? What's a bank? 
Now we are in the 2020s. A pandemic, runaway inflation, recessions, massive losses on investments and another 
decade of trials, struggles and consternation. Small businesses have never been challenged more, but then most 
people have never been more challenged. The threats of bad things - the world ending, going bankrupt, wars and 
the use of nuclear weapons - have never been more real. And yet things for the average Joe and Jane - or should I 
say they, he or her - goes on, as does technology. 
Society in the 2020s is developing into a more local and protective vision. The lockdowns have made us home 
buddies, and the idea of globalisation is disappearing. We still want to travel, but we are nervous about travelling. 
FinTech Forces of the Future, Part Three: People and Society
We are a nervous species. Wars have been happening throughout the last fifty years, but they're getting bigger and 
nearer. Suddenly, thanks to the conflict in the Ukraine, America and Europe's battle lines are being redrawn. China 
has become a visible threat to the Europe and American alliance, whilst Russia is a pariah. 
Society is worried, but continues to behave differently. Activism is far more rife than ever before. Activist 
movements like Extinction Rebellion are rife, because people no longer believe in politicians - they believe in the 
power of the network. 
This conflict between the power of the people through the network versus the power of the politicians through the 
government is the biggest social battle of the 2020s. It is evidenced by activist consumer movements, 
demonstrations, cryptocurrencies, cyberattacks, the rejection of traditional institutions and the growth of new 
institutions. 
The main street is dying, the malls are empty, the physical is dead. Consumers have doubled-down to become all 
digital. This has been driven by lockdown. You can't have much fun if you can't go out, but you can still watch 
Netflix and buy stuff from Amazon. 
All of this has culminated in a massive social change from physical to digital. In banking, it has created a mass 
move or has it? Not really. Banking is a strong and stable market. Consumers and businesses want reliability and 
resilience. In fact, in the 2020s, consumers and small businesses are better served than ever before but, primarily, 
by traditional banks who are integrating FinTech ideas. 
Society is becoming truly digital. 
You can work wherever you want to work, travel to where you want to go, eat whatever you want to eat and find 
love wherever love can be found. We are truly global, but very local. 
The future? The future society? 
The future society will take this one step beyond. We are about to become a multiplanetary society. Space tourism 
is already a thing, and a space hotel that is a bit like the International Space Station is already being built. Balloon 
flights to space and back in a few hours are possible, and the idea of humans settling on Mars is becoming more 
and more of a reality every day. 
The future society will be one where any human, anywhere in any part of our universe, can sit and chat, and trade 
and transact, because they're connected. The biggest issue is going to be if the connection breaks down. 
Nevertheless, when I think about generations before us, they had no idea. Just think, two centuries ago, most 
people were not educated. They couldn't read or write. Today, most countries encourage a basic level of education. 
Some countries ensure it. 
The more people who can read and write and communicate, the better the world becomes? The more the world 
progresses. The more we know, the better we get? I ask this as a question, as our globally connected world of 
social media and networking allows all of us to find out everything, everywhere. Does this make our world better? I 
don't have the answers, just raising the questions, but if I did try to answer I would say,yes.Our world is better 
because our ability to read, write and communicate, allows us to understand each other better. The more we talk, 
the better we become. 
As the eternal optimist, the future society feels like it will be one globally connected, globally communicated and 
with a global currency based upon a global network. We will all be assimilated and spend our holidays on Mars and 
our birthdays on Venus. Well, the men may go to Mars and the women to Venus at the very least[1].

Newstex)  
 Flight cancellations and long queues have become the norm at Germany's understaffed airports. The hospitality 
sector is desperately looking to hire personnel, too.Amelie and her sister Amrei Quincke, from Essen in western 
Germany, were looking forward to a relaxing holiday in Budapest this summer. Two days before they were due to 
depart for Hungary, however, Eurowings cancelled their flight. So instead, they were forced to catch a train to 
Budapest, as no alternative flights were available. These days, many holidaymakers are experiencing similar 
ordeals. 
One reason for these flight cancellations are staff shortages at German airports. Some 7,200 vacant positions need 
to be filled, according to a study by the German Economic Institute (IW). This is a result of many airport workers 
leaving the aviation industry during the pandemic and finding employment elsewhere. With understaffed airports, 
holidaymakers are now facing countless flight cancellations and long queues at check-in and security. Germany's 
biggest carrier, Lufthansa, scrapped over 2,000 connections from Munich and Frankfurt airports this holiday 
season. An additional 900 bank holiday and weekend flights have been cancelled this July. 
No staff shortages at Deutsche Bahn 
Fortunately for Deutsche Bahn (DB), Germany's national railway company, staffing is not an issue. Last year, DB 
hired 22,000 new people nationwide. 
Frankfurt airport, one of Germany's major aviation hubs, is not so fortunate. It is seeing a high volume of inbound 
and outgoing flights, almost on par with pre-pandemic levels. But it is struggling to cope. Authorities have begun 
recruiting additional staff, especially for ground handling. But even if this recruitment drive proves successful, many 
believe travelers will have to prepare for long waits at Frankfurt airport over the next few months. 
Poor working conditions are another reason for staff shortages. The airline Ryanair, for instance, does not comply 
with labor laws and court rulings to respect workers' rights, say Spanish trade union USO. It has joined Sitcpla 
union is calling for strikes, which will affect all of Europe. 
Foreign workers to the rescue? 
The German government is thinking about bringing in scores of foreign workers to compensate for these protracted 
staff shortages. So far, recruiting foreigners, or hiring Ukrainian refugees, involved of a lot of paperwork in 
Germany. The general manager of the German Airports Association (ADV), Ralph Beisel, welcomes the plan to 
bring in workers from abroad, saying talks are being held with individual businesses in the aviation industry so that 
German tourist and hospitality industry mired by staff shortages
baggage handling companies and airports can start hiring soon. Airline Lufthansa, however, does not expect 
operations to normalize until 2023.  
Labor shortages predate the pandemic 
Germany's hospitality and catering industry, meanwhile, is even more short-staffed. Andrea Belegante, director of 
Germany's Catering Association (BdS), says this problem was already clearly noticeable before the COVID 
pandemic. The number of trainees in this industry has been steadily falling. To attract new staff, the industry 
organization has sought to establish standardized wages, additional work benefits and training deals. 
Germany's Institute for Employment Research (IAB) says the food-service industry has always been subject to staff 
fluctuations. If, however, companies fail to find people to fill these vacancies, these companies are left facing 
serious staff shortages. 
Hospitality sector under pressure 
The German Hotel and Restaurants Association (DEHOGA) says recruiting new staff is currently the biggest 
challenge facing the industry. It says over 60% of businesses in the industry are looking to hire. On top of this, the 
sector lost some €75billion ($77 billion) in revenue between March 2020 and 2022, due to pandemic-related 
restrictions. The last thing hotels and restaurants now need is more uncertainty. "Many companies will not survive a 
new round of restrictions and closures," says DEHOGA head Guido Zöllick. "Protecting companies and jobs must 
be a priority now." 
Amelie and her sister Amrei Quincke eventually reached Budapest by rail, and they enjoyed themselves a lot in the 
Hungarian capital. Their return flight with Eurowings, however, posed a new set of challenges. Heading to the 
airport, they received a text message informing them their flight would be delayed by an hour. Soon after, they 
received a second message, saying the flight would be two hours late. Yet at the airport, they were told nothing 
about delays. Suddenly, the sisters learned the flight was due to depart as scheduled, forcing them to sprint to their 
gate to catch the plane. 
Following further organizational chaos and delays, the two finally touched down in Germany. They hope their future 
travels won't be as exhausting and stressful.

 Labor trouble has emerged as a major pain point for the Airline industry of late. Amid this problem, European 
carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] received some encouraging tidings when it reached a pay-related agreement 
with the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA). 
The deal will accelerate pay restoration of pilots at RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and 
ensure pay hikes post restoration through 2026. The restoration of pay is necessary as RYAAY intends to expand 
capacity as much as 115% of the pre-coronavirus levels in the current year itself to meet the demand swell. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[2] 
Per Ryanair's people director Darrell Hughes 'While 100% of our pilots across our European network are covered 
by 2020 Emergency Agreements, we continue to work with our pilots and their unions on new deals, similar to this 
one concluded with BALPA, and have successfully re-negotiated improved long-term agreements with 70% of our 
pilots, running until 2026 or 2027 as we prioritize pay restoration.' Naturally, for this capacity expansion, it is 
imperative to keep RYAAY's group of pilots satisfied. The pay increments apart, pilots at RYAAY also become 
eligible for other benefits. 
That air-travel demand is northbound can be gauged from Ryanair's traffic report for June, where it operated more 
than 8,500 flights. RYAAY attracted 15.9 million passengers in the month, up 203% year over year. Load factor (% 
of seats filled with passengers) touched 95% in June from 72% a year ago. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked 
stocks in the broader ZacksTransportation[3]sector areKirbyKEX[4] and C.H. Robinson WorldwideCHRW[5]. 
Kirby has an expected earnings growth rate of 278.6% for the current year. KEX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.7%, on average. 
Kirby has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%. Shares of KEX have gained 2.3% so far this year. Gradual 
recovery in economic conditions is benefiting Kirby. 
C.H. Robinson has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.9% for the current year. CHRW delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 17.1%, on average. 
C.H. Robinson has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9%. Shares of CHRW have gained 8.8% over the past year. 
Uptick in freight conditions in the United States aids C.H. Robinson. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) Inks Deal With UK Pilots' Union
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Faces Strike Action by Cabin Crew in Spain

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] staff across various parts of Europe have been on strike lately as they demand 
improved pay and better working conditions. To this end, per a Reuters report[2], Ryanair's Spain-based cabin crew 
announced its plans to strike for 12 days this month. The dates are Jul 12-15, 18-21 and 25-28 across 10 Spanish 
airports. This latest announcement came on the final day of the crew's current strike, leading to the cancellation of 
10 flights in Spain on Jul 2. 
A Spain-based cabin crew at easyJet are striking for nine days this month for higher pay. easyJet canceled five 
flights from Spain on Jul 2. Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport workers were on strike on Jul 1 and Jul 2, leading to the 
cancellation of almost 10% of flights. 
Meanwhile, a popular holiday destination in Portugal (despite facing no ongoing strikes) is expected to suffer from 
65 flight cancellations to and from Lisbon on Jul 2, backed by a combined impact of flight disruptions at multiple 
European airports. 
So far, despite facing strikes in recent days by cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy, 
Ryanair claims to have witnessed minimal impact on its operations over the Jun 24-26 weekend. 
RYAAY continues to hope that impending strikes may not affect its operations. However, Air Traffic Control strikes 
and airport staff shortages across Europe are some factors that can cause minor travel chaos. 
Such flight disruptions due to staff shortage during the peak summer travel period seem to be a hindrance for this 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) European carrier. Notably, shares of RYAAY have lost 32.9% year to date compared with 
23.1% loss of the industry[3] it belongs to.

The negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being 
revised 11.6% downward over the past 90 days. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the broader 
ZacksTransportation[4]sector are Kirby KEX[5], C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[6] andDiana Shipping Inc.

Newstex)  
 Airlines hoping to cash in on renewed demand are facing labor agitation after firing swathes of workers during the 
pandemic.Hundreds of flights from various European airports were cancelled or delayed on Saturday as the 
industry struggles with ongoing worker strikes. 
Labor action by cabin crews at the two low-cost airlines EasyJet and Ryanair as well as by airport workers in 
Europe's second-busiest airport — Roissy-Charles de Gaulle in Paris — are causing major headaches for airlines 
just as the first school summer holidays begin after two years of pandemic restrictions. 
One in five flights from the main Paris airport were cancelled on Saturday morning, while the EasyJet and Ryanair 
strike led to the cancellation of 15 flights to and from Spain with another 175 delayed. 
Ryanair's cabin crew also announced another 12 days of work stoppages. Paris airport workers said they will walk 
out again on July 8 to 10. 
Low-cast airlines facing further strike disruptions 
The striking cabin crews are demanding improvements to their working conditions and pay to put them in line with 
other European airlines. 
Ryanair employees have been striking since June 24, with the aim of bringing the company to the negotiation table, 
while EasyJet cabin crews joined the strike on Friday. 
"After six days of strike and in view of the unwillingness of the company to listen to its staff and its preference for 
leaving thousands of passengers grounded rather than sitting down to negotiate an agreement under Spanish law, 
we have been forced to call new strike days," said Lidia Arasanz from the USO union that has organized the 
Ryanair workers. 
Arasanz said that the initial strike had seen a total so far of "more than 200 flights cancelled and almost 1,000 
delays," adding that the new strike could cause even more disruptions. 
Strike action in France and Scandinavia 
Airport workers at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle are fighting for a wage hike to balance out rising costs from inflation. 
They had been offered a 4% pay increase on the condition that they end the strike on Friday, but this was rejected. 
"A majority of workers think the offer is not good enough," said Daniel Bertone, who represents the CGT union. 
"They don't trust management and they don't accept the 'it's this or nothing' blackmail." 
The industry slashed thousands of jobs during the pandemic when people were unable or unwilling to fly, but they 
have been unable to refill positions as the new post-restrictions demand has soared. 
European flights cancelled and delayed amid ongoing strikes
Airports in the UK and the Netherlands struggled to deal with the surge in traffic earlier in the year, while France 
was largely spared. 
Pilots for the Scandinavian SAS airline delayed a planned strike on Saturday after negotiations with company 
management showed some progress. If the 900 pilots go ahead with their strike, hundreds of flights per day will 
likely be cancelled.

 Long-haul flights are a necessary evil[1] and I was intrigued this week to see Air New Zealand is launching the 
world's first sleep pods for economy class travellers. 
This is a rare bit of good news for aviation[2] design. I'm still smarting from Ryanair's idea to remove toilets from 
planes[3] and its Skyrider[4] concept, a 'standing seat' from the pits of hell. 
It's baaaaaack! The AvioInteriors Skyrider saddle seat is returning to #AIX18[5] after its controversial reception. Will 
the fact that 28' is normal on low-cost carriers mean that a 23' squat for a (very) short flight seems more #PaxEx[6] 
palatable? #avgeek[7] pic.twitter.com/zLylr91NiT[8]

Hi there, EV nerd! Subscribe now for a weekly recap of our favorite mobility stories 
Fortunately, it's not all bad. There are plenty of people designing airplane interiors with passenger comfort in mind. 
Here are some of the latest (and greatest) ideas: 
Sleep pods https://thenextweb.com /news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-design#Fly Air 
New Zealand and you get to lie flat in a pod. Image: Air New Zealand[10]; 
When you fly long-haul, all you want to do is lie flat. And now you can — all without shelling out for tickets you need 
a mortgage for. 
Yes, I'm talking about Air New Zealand's sleep pods. Each bunk-bed unit has its own mattress, sheets, privacy 
curtain, USB charging, and ventilation. 
However, the pods are communal, and the passengers can only book a pod for four hours. 
Worse, there are only six pods per plane. A plane flies about 200 passengers, so assuming they service about 24 
over several four-hour shifts, there will be 176 other passengers who are mightily pissed off that they didn't get a 
booking. 
Just wait for the air rage, people.

6 bizarre airplane interior designs that could change flying forever

The cloud capsule is designed to increase passenger comfort while making the airline more money. 
The pay-extra capsules sit above the outboard aisles and can be used to sleep, relax, or focus on work in a private 
setting.

So it's a bit like having people sleeping in an overhead locker. Or you can just lie there and feel the burning 
resentment of those unfortunate enough to be sitting underneath you. A touch creepy, but it's not like I'd say no. 
SpaceChiller 
https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-
design#SpaceChiller gives you your very own mini bar. Image credit: Collins Aerospace[12] 
SpaceChiller by Collins Aerospace[12] is a personal mini-bar requiring half the power of traditional designs. 
SpaceChiller uses advanced heat sinks, initially developed by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency 
(DARPA), reducing power consumption by up to 50% over alternate thermoelectric systems and can be leveraged 
across multiple service areas and passenger seats. 
I love the idea of not having to ask for a drink at 3 AM when I'm deep into bingeing whatever nonsense the airline 
has decided I must watch. Bring it on. 
Elevate 
cabins 
https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-
design#Luxury you don't even have at home. Image credit: Teague[13]  
Imagine a cabin with natural materials and 'floating furniture' attached to wall braces so you can easily store stuff 
under it. Designed by Teague[13] and NORDAM, the design gets thumbs up space without removing seat capacity. 
The downside, of course, is that you likely need some serious coin to be able to afford to use it, but I can dream. 
Chaise Longue Airplane Seat https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-
aircraft-design#This prototype design looks a bit like a torture chamber, sorry. Credit: Crystal Cabin Award [14] 
You can blame Delft Technical University for this design. It's the brainchild of graduate student Alejandro Núñez 
Vicente who told CNN Travel[15] of his goal to 'change the economy class seats for the better of humanity, or for all 
the people that cannot afford to pay for more expensive tickets.' 
Lofty ambition or masochistic design? 
I like the under-storage for those seated above, and I'm short enough that being that close to the ceiling in an upper 
seat wouldn't bother me. But I dislike my chance of staying upright when stepping down — especially after a few gin 
and tonics. 
But while some marvel at Núñez Vicente's innovation, the internet is divided, with posters on Reddit[16] concerned 
about ease of evacuation, the risk of breaking your knees, and claustrophobia for the lower passenger. One 
commenter declared: 'just sedate me and put me in a drawer already' 
Vincente is apparently in talks with investors and airlines. 
The Coffee House Cabin https://thenextweb.com/news/air-new-zealand-sleep-pod-weird-and-wonderful-aircraft-
design#When airplane meets workspace. Credit: Crystal Cabin awards[14]  
This design is a winner from last year's Crystal Cabin awards[14] in the University student category, but I dig it, so I 
decided to share it with you. 
A long table runs down the center of the cabin, creating a handy space for remote work, meetings, and coffee 
drinking. Imagine it. You can open your laptop without fear that the moron in front of you will push their seat back 
and break it. 
While most of these ideas are more in the design than the commercial phase, what's clear is that flying[17] - 
especially luxury aviation[18] - is still incredibly popular. As we create new aircraft modes, we need new cabin 
interiors, and these designs might be the start of something amazing.

Jun 28, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, both Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[1] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] as interested parties 
sweetened their respective offers for buying Spirit Airlines SAVE[3]. The moves made just ahead of SAVE's 
shareholder vote on Jun 30, are aimed at wooing its shareholders. 
Per Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] management, strikes by its cabin crew members in certain European countries 
over the weekend did not have any meaningful impact on its operations. In all probability, pilots of Chicago-based 
United Airlines UAL[5] will get significant pay hikes over the next 18 months. 
With labor problems hurting the U.S. airline industry, the approval of a tentative two-year agreement covering about 
14,000 pilots at UAL is certainly a huge positive. Like UAL, Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska 
Air Group ALK[6], too received encouraging tidings on the labor front when it reached a provisional pay-related 
agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Recap of the Latest Top 
Stories 1.Per the latest offer from Frontier, ULCC increased its per-share cash consideration by $2 to $4.13, 
payable to Spirit Airlines' shareholders. This is in addition to 1.9126 Frontier shares that ULCC had agreed to pay 
previously. ULCC will also prepay $2.22 per share to SAVE's shareholders as cash dividend upon approval of the 
transaction. Frontier also increased its reverse termination fee by $100 million to $350 million, payable to Spirit 
Airlines in case the deal fails to materialize due to antitrust concerns[7]. 
Not to be left behind, JetBlue, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),came up with an improved offer to buy 
SAVE. Per the enhanced offer, JetBlue will prepay $2.50 per share as cash dividend to SAVE's shareholders soon 
after they vote in favor of the deal. This is higher than the prepayment of $1.50 per share agreed upon previously. 
JBLU has also increased the reverse break-up fee to $400 million from the previous $350 million, payable to Spirit 
Airlines in case the deal falls through due to antitrust concerns. JetBlue's improved proposal also includes a ticking 
fee to provide Spirit Airlines shareholders with a monthly prepayment of 10 cents per share between January 2023 
and the closing or termination of the deal. This increases the transaction value to $34.15 per share. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. UAL's pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, Int'l (ALPA), approved a tentative agreement on 
modified terms for their collective bargaining deal. The United Master Executive Council represents 14,000 
professional pilots at UAL. The provisional agreement will now be sent for ratification. The voting procedure must be 
Airline Stock Roundup: Pay Hike Likely for UAL Pilots, SAVE Takeover Saga & More
complete by Jul 15. The provisional deal will be valid only if the voting result is favorable. On successful ratification, 
the TA will generate an additional value of $1.3 billion for the United Airlines pilots over the two-year long 
agreement. 
Under the terms of the agreement, pilots will get three pay-rate raises totaling more than 14.5% within 18 months, 
retroactive to the commencement of the current year. The deal also includes a new eight-week paid maternity leave 
benefit, better overtime and premium pay, a new retirement plan and improved scheduling provisions, among other 
benefits.[9] 
3. At Alaska Airlines, the tentative deal covers 5,300 employees, including those who work at the ramp, stores, 
clerical, office and passenger service for the Seattle, WA-based airline. However, the deal does not cover roughly 
2,000 ramp workers, also represented by IAM, who work for the McGee Air Services subsidiary and handle 
baggage on passenger flights. The four-year deal, on materialization, will make the 5,300 employees eligible for a 
substantial pay raise. Salient features of the contract include higher base wage rates for all classifications in the 
8.9-17.4% band, effective Aug 10, 2022. The employees will be eligible for a further 2.5% hike in all base wage 
rates for all classifications from the same date of 2023. Base wage rate will also increase 2.5% for the following two 
years. The existing job security clause (amendable on Sep 27, 2026) is extended to Sep 27, 2028[10]. 
4. Per aReuters report[11], strikes by RYAAY's cabin crew in various European nations did not leave much impact 
on the airline's operations. Per management, "Less than 2% of Ryanair's 9,000 flights operating this weekend 
(24/25/26 June) have been affected by minor and poorly supported crew strikes". Cabin crew members in Spain are 
scheduled to go on a strike again for three days starting Jun 30. That RYAAY would face strikes by its cabin crew 
over the weekend was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[12]. Performance The following table shows the 
price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that almost all the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index has increased 2.6% to $57.74. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
plummeted 29.1%. What's Next in the Airline Space? All eyes will be on Spirit Airlines shareholders' vote scheduled 
for Jun 30. The outcome of Thursday's vote should bring down the curtains on the bidding war for SAVE.

Cabin Crew Strikes Have Minimal Effect on Ryanair ( RYAAY )

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] have declined 27.6% year to date as the stock is mired in multiple 
headwinds. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Apart from high fuel costs, labor woes are plaguing this European carrier, which currently carries a Zacks Rank # 5 
(Strong Sell). The negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year 
earnings being revised 10.1% downward over the past 60 days. 
Highlighting the labor woes, RYAAY's cabin crew in some European countries like Belgium, Spain and Italy went on 
strike over the weekend. The cabin crew unions accused the Irish carrier of being insensitive toward local labor 
laws pertaining to minimum wage and working conditions. 
However, per a Reuters report[2], the strikes in various European nations did not leave much impact on the airline's 
operations. Per management, "Less than 2% of Ryanair's 9,000 flights operating this weekend (24/25/26 June) 
have been affected by minor and poorly supported crew strikes". Cabin crew members in Spain are scheduled to go 
on a strike again for three days starting Jun 30. 
RYAAY will be hoping that the impending strikes may also not affect its operations as was the case this weekend. 
This is because if the strikes work, then RYAAY's plans of attracting a significant traffic during the summer may 
take a hit. 
Driven by elevated traffic, RYAAY expects load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) readings to be impressive 
this summer. Watch this space for further updates on this key issue. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks 
in the broader ZacksTransportation[3]sector are Ryder System R[4],C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[5] andGATX 
Corporation GATX[6]. 
Ryderhas a trailing-four quarter surprise of 48.2%, on average, with its earnings having surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters.R is benefiting from improving economic and freight conditions in 
the United States. 
Revenues in all segments grew (on higher rental revenues, new business and favorable pricing) in first-quarter 
2022. R currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here.[7] 
Cabin Crew Strikes Have Minimal Effect on Ryanair ( RYAAY )
The expected long-term (three-to-five years) earnings per share growth rate forC.H. Robinsonis pegged at 
9%.Better freight market conditions are aiding CHRW. 
In first-quarter 2022, the top line improved 41.8% owing to favorable truckload pricing for customers and handsome 
profits in ocean freight. CHRW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. 
GATXhas a trailing-four quarter surprise of 40.1%, on average, with its earnings having surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters. 
The gradual improvement in the North American railcar leasing market is a boon for GATX. GATX currently has a 
Zacks Rank of 2.

 Following thechaotic scenes[2]witnessed at US airports over the last several weeks, travel chaos has spread to 
Europe as airlines canceled thousands of flights this summer.  
 Bloomberg[3]reports Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the second-largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger volume, 
canceled 3,100 flights for July and August as COVID-19 infections exacerbated staffing shortages.  
 Germany's top airline slashed 2,200 domestic flights on Friday, adding to the 900 announced weeks ago at 
Frankfurt and Munich hubs.  
 "In order to inform the passengers as early as possible, Lufthansa will now take another 2,200 of a total of around 
80,000 flights at the hubs in Frankfurt and Munich out of the system for the summer - also on the others, so far less 
affected days of the week. The cancellations relate in particular to domestic German and intra-European flights, but 
not to the classic holiday destinations, which are well occupied during the holiday season. In addition, there may 
also be changes in flight times," Lufthansa spokesman told German newspaperBILD[4].  
 Besides Lufthansa, labor strikes are emerging among Ryanair Holdings Plc, IAG SA's British Airways, and 
Brussels Airlines (Belgian subsidiary of Lufthansa) employees.  
 Cabin crew at Ryanair went on strike across Belgium, Spain, and Portugal on Friday over lack of pay amid surging 
inflation. British Airways check-in staff are set to strike at Heathrow Airport in London. And Brussels Airlines workers 
began strikes on Thursday.

 BREAKING: British Airways workers at Heathrow have voted to strike during the school summer holidays in a 
move set to cause more travel chaos as the industry struggles to recover from the pandemic.

 "Airports have had to adjust their schedules as a result of the chaos. London Gatwick last week announced it 
would scrap hundreds of flights over the peak summer travel period — hours after Amsterdam's Schiphol hub took 
a similar step — because of the deepening staffing crisis," Bloomberg said.  
 Have you got European travel plans this summer? Be prepared for delays and canceled flights, similar to what's 
happening in the US because of apilot shortage[2].

Jun 22, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the latest development pertaining to the takeover of the Miramar, FL-based Spirit Airlines SAVE[1], JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[2] raised its offer to purchase SAVE. The move, made just ahead of Spirit's shareholder vote on Jun 
30, is aimed at winning this buyout race from rival bidder Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[3]. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] labor problems deepened with its cabin crew planning to go on strike 
shortly in certain European countries. On the other hand, U.S. based low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines LUV[5] 
raised its view for June quarter's load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) driven by upbeat air-travel demand. 
Again, owing to increased passenger traffic, Allegiant Travel's ALGT[6] load factor of 86.6% recorded in May was 
the highest in a month since the onset of the pandemic. Load factor for June is estimated to be roughly 90% Recap 
of the Latest Top Stories 1.Per the latest offer, JetBlue is offering $33.50 per share to Spirit Airlines' shareholders, 
up from the previous proposal of $31.50. This represents a premium of 68% to Frontier Group Holdings' proposal to 
acquire Spirit Airlines. JetBlue's enhanced proposal continues to offer a reverse break-up fee of $350 million (or 
$3.20 per Spirit Airlines share) payable to Spirit Airlines in case the deal fails to materialize due to antitrust 
concerns. The company had initially offered a reverse break-up fee of $200 million. Frontier's proposal consists of a 
reverse termination fee of $250 million. 
JBLU would prepay $1.50 per share in cash to Spirit Airlines' shareholders as soon as they vote in favor of the 
merger deal. With this, SAVE's shareholders will receive $33.50 per share in cash, consisting of $32 per share in 
cash at the time of closing of the transaction and the prepayment of $1.50 per share of the reverse break-up fee. 
Spirit Airlines confirmed the receipt of JetBlue's updated proposal and said that the board would evaluate it. In 
February, Frontier first offered to acquire Spirit Airlines in a $2.9-billion deal. Per the terms of the merger 
agreement, Spirit Airlines' shareholders will receive $25.83 per share. SAVE will own approximately 48.5% of the 
combined airline, while the remaining will be owned by ULCC[7]. 
2. Per a Reuters report[8], unions representing Ryanair's cabin crew are planning to go on strike in Belgium and 
Portugal from Jun 24 to Jun 26, in their quest for improved pay and working conditions. In France, they plan a strike 
from Jun 25 to Jun 26 and in Italy on Jun 25. Unions are also planning to go on strike in Spain on Jun 24, Jun 25, 
Jun 26, Jun 30, and Jul 1-Jul 2. The strikes, on materialization, may act as a spoiler as far as its plans of generating 
Airline Stock Roundup: JBLU Ups Bid for SAVE , RYAAY 's Labor Woes & More
high load factor readings in the summer months are concerned. That load factor is expected to be high in summer 
was discussed in the previous week's write-up[9]. 
3. Riding on the healthy booking trend, Southwest Airlines, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), upped 
its forecast for second-quarter 2022 load factor. The Dallas-based low-cost carrier now expects load factor in the 
85-87% range compared with the earlier estimate of 85%. Capacity forecast is being kept same (down 7% from 
second-quarter 2019 actuals). That means that the upped load factor forecast implies a higher level of traffic. Even 
though total operating revenues are likely to improve 12-15% from second-quarter 2019 actuals, the uptick is owing 
to the improvement in leisure travel. LUV expects second-quarter 2022 managed business revenues to be down in 
the 20-25% range, compared with second-quarter 2019 levels. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[10]. 
4. In May, Allegiant carried 40% more passengers, system-wide, than a year ago. Available seat miles (a measure 
of capacity) increased 17.1% year over year for the total system as ALGT expands capacity to meet increased 
demand. In sync with ALGT's capacity-expansion efforts, capacity for scheduled operations increased 15.5% in 
May 2022 from the May 2019 actuals (pre-coronavirus era). Due to the increase in oil price, ALGT now expects the 
average fuel price per gallon for the June quarter to be $4.30 (earlier estimate was $4). Due to increased flight 
cancellations as a result of labor crunch and a spike in COVID-19 cases, ALGT expects[11] second-quarter 2022 
operating revenues to increase roughly 28% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals, which matches the lowest end 
of the previous estimate of an increase in the 28-32% range. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
declined 1.7% to $56.26, despite the 6% uptick in SAVE shares following the upgraded takeover offer from JBLU. 
Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index plummeted 31.9%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? Air-travel in the United States is being currently hampered due to the labor-crunch induced flight 
cancellations. With the labor unrest continuing, further updates on the issue are expected in the coming days.

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] staff across various parts of Europe are planning to go on strike in late June as they 
seek improved pay and working conditions. This disruption during the peak summer travel period is a major blow to 
RYAAY, which has been seeing strengthening bookings and expects high summer fares and strong load factor[2]. 
Unions representing Ryanair's cabin crew are planning to go on strike in Belgium and Portugal from Jun 24 to Jun 
26, according to a Reuters report[3]. In France, they plan a strike from Jun 25 to Jun 26 and in Italy on Jun 25. 
Unions are also planning to go on strike in Spain on Jun 24, Jun 25, Jun 26, Jun 30, and Jul 1-Jul 2. Ryanair

A Ryanair spokesperson said that unions should try to negotiate for yielding improvements rather than disrupt 
Belgian customers' travel plans, the Reuters report stated. RYAAY CEO, Michael O'Leary, said that the union 
allegations were "complete rubbish." "We fully comply with Belgian law, we have labor agreements here with both 
the pilot unions and the cabin crew unions," O'Leary said at a news conference. During a strike in April, less than 
40% of Ryanair's Belgian flights were affected, O'Leary added. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks 
Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation[6] sector are as follows: 
Star Bulk Carriers SBLK[7] carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 7.1%. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
Shares of Star Bulk have gained more than 19% in a year. 
Golar LNG Limited GLNG[9] carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, 
having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed once, the 
average surprise being 42.1%. 
Shares of Golar LNG have rallied more than 64% in a year.

 When the 5th largest Economy in the World can spend 133 billion on nuclear weapons whilst NHS figures showed 
illnesses linked to Victorian poverty and lack of food were making a comeback, with cases of scurvy and 
malnutrition doubling since the Conservatives came to power, you know the people making the decisions are not 
doing the best job they can. 
The same people who told NHS staff that a 1% payrise was all they could afford while just writing off 11 billion of 
illegitimate Covid loans and burning 4 billion of PPE which they purchased but was unusable are now trying to say 
that the Train Staff who are striking next week are 'hurting the nations workers'. Not as much as you spaffing our 
money away it won't says every UK taxpayer. As much as they want to keep the focus on how much a train driver 
earns compared to everyone else, therefore pitting workers against each other, the strike is also about safety as job 
cuts hit and the reduction of the terms and conditions in their contracts but it isn't just getting on a train which will be 
tougher this summer, so will travelling on a bus or plane and getting your bins emptied as the UK Summer of 
Discontent takes hold. The list includes rail strikes along with tube and tram services and British Airways airport 
staff are being balloted on industrial action with Ryanair and easyJet already agreeing to walk outs as have Arriva 
buses which affects most of the northern half of the country. Post Office staff have firmed up their dates for 
upcoming strike action and waste is piling up on some streets as Bin workers across the country are set to continue 
their strike in what they are calling the 'summer of stink'. Civil Service Union, PCS, is balloting members on a 
striking for three days over job cuts as are the unions for BT, Openreach and EE staff so things could be about to 
get very uncomfortable, and smelly, very quickly.

 Per a Reuters report[1], Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[2] CEO, Michael O'Leary, said that with strengthening bookings, 
the company is expecting summer fares to increase 7-9% from the pre-pandemic levels. 
O'Leary said that it expects load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) to nearly reach pre-pandemic 
levels, to around 94%, in June. "And July, August, and September look very strong with higher load factors and also 
higher fares," he added. 
Ryanair expects airport management groups to "iron out" staffing shortages through recruitments, as a result of 
which travelers should have an improved experience over the summer. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

While RYAAY seems optimistic about attracting substantial traffic during the summer travel period, its Spanish 
cabin crew recently warned of strike actions[5] between late June and early July, potentially jeopardizing its summer 
travel plans. 
O'Leary, however, said that any disruption caused by industrial action is likely to be "tiny and inconsequential". 
While saying that the proposed strike has "no support", he gave a heads up that there could be a small number of 
cancellations or delays. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 With U.S. airlines grappling with pilot shortage, American Airlines AAL[1] has received encouraging tidings on the 
labor front, in the past week. Two regional carriers, Piedmont Airlines and Envoy Air, owned by AAL will hike the 
pay of their pilots by 50% through the August end. Latin American carrier Copa Holdings CPA[2] reported a decline 
in May traffic from the comparable period's level in 2019. 
With air fares moving north as airlines try to cover the increasing fuel expenses, European carrier Ryanair Holdings' 
RYAAY[3] CEO expects ticket prices this summer to increase in the 7- 9% range from the pre-pandemic levels. An 
expansion update was also available from JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[5]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.Following the pay hike, hourly wages at 
Piedmont Airlines for first officers in their first year wil be increased to $90 an hour from $51. For first-year captains, 
pay will be raised to $146 an hour from $78. Piedmont's CEO said that the airline could even extend temporary 
hikes if needed. Piedmont's pilots are moving to American Airlines' mainline operations, leaving the carrier with a 
shortage of 25 pilots each month. Envoy Air reached a similar agreement with its pilots' union to offer a 50% 
premium to pilots' hourly rates through the end of August 2024. Envoy continues seeing about 80 of its pilots 
quitting every year to take up work in other airlines. The regional carrier has been hiring about 60 pilots a year for a 
while. On materialization, the increased remuneration will make the pilots of these two airlines the highest paid staff 
among the U.S. regional airlines[6]. 
2. Copa Holdings' traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), declined 4.2% to 1.72 billion in May 2022 
from the comparable period's level in 2019. The downside was primarily due to coronavirus-induced lower air-travel 
demand than the pre-pandemic levels (2019). Due to tepid demand, capacity — measured in available seat miles 
(ASMs) — fell 3.7% from the 2019 level to 2 billion. With traffic declining more than the amount of capacity 
contraction, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) deteriorated 40 basis points (bps) to 85.7% in 
May. 
3. To cater to the increasing air-travel demand, JetBlue launched operations in Canada with daily nonstop flights 
from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Vancouver International Airport. With international 
travel demand recovering, the service is expected to attract substantial traffic this summer. This expansion is part of 
JetBlue's Northeast Alliance with American Airlines. JBLU is also expected to launch service to Vancouver from 
Airline Stock Roundup: CPA's May Traffic, RYAAY's Air-Fare Update, AAL in Focus
Boston, MA as part of this partnership. JBLU, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is operating this new 
Vancouver service on an Airbus A320 aircraft featuring more legroom in coach, free broadband internet, and 
complimentary snacks and soft drinks[7]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
4. Per a Reuters report[9], Ryanair's CEOMichael O'Leary said that with strengthening bookings, management 
expects summer fares to increase 7-9% from the pre-pandemic levels. O'Leary said that it expects load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) to nearly reach the pre-pandemic levels of around 94% in June. "And 
July, August, and September look very strong with higher load factors and also higher fares," he added. Ryanair 
expects airport management groups to "iron out" staffing crisis through recruitment to enhance travelers' experience 
over the summer. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the 
past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks have traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has declined 13.6% to $57.01. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 26%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel demand increasing, more expansion-related updates from carriers 
may be available in the coming days.

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] have declined 25.4% year to date, underperforming its industry[2]'s 16.2% 
fall. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The stock may face further hiccups as RYAAY's cabin crew may possibly call a strike in many European nations 
during the summer season. Per a Bloomberg report[3], pay-related talks with two Spanish unions (SITCPLA and 
USO) failed. 
Following Ryanair's walkout from negotiations, the unions accused RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 
(Strong Sell), of acting in bad faith. The unions intend to return for further negotiations. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[4] 
A representative of the SITCPLA labor group said, 'We're coordinating our actions with European counterparts.' The 
two unions apart, workers' organizations in countries like Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal are also in favor of 
taking drastic actions if Ryanair does not agree to resume a dialogue. 
As a matter of fact, if this impasse continues and the strike threat materializes, Ryanair's plans to generate 
substantial traffic and revenues during the usually busy summer season may take a hit. 
Last month, RYAAY's management had projected the load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) to 
reach the pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in June-August. RYAAY CEO Michael O'Leary had said at that time, 
"Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen - both the numbers are strengthening and 
average fares being paid through the summer are rising." 
It will be interesting to see if the above labor problem hampers these plans. Stay tuned for further updates on this 
burning issue. Stocks to Consider Better-ranked stocks within the broaderTransportation[5]sector include the 
following: 
Golar LNG LimitedGLNG[6] currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GLNG has a decent surprise history, as its 
earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed the mark 
once, the average surprise being 42.1%. 
Shares of Golar LNG have rallied more than 100% in a year. A strong LNG market boosted the stock.The 
staggering inflation flared up the oil and natural gas prices. Moreover, amid the Russia-Ukraine war, Europe is likely 
Strike Specter Looms on Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Due to Labor Woes
to look for gas supplies outside Russia. This is expected to drive demand for the LNG vessels, which bodes well for 
GLNG. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[7]: Continued recovery in air-travel demand bodes well for Southwest Airlines. Anticipating 
a steady improvement in bookings, the carrier expects to reap profits in the remaining three quarters of 2022 as well 
as during the full year. LUV's management predicts operating revenues to increase 12-15% in the second quarter of 
2022 from the comparable period's level in 2019. LUV is seeing strong bookings for the spring and summer trips. 
The positivity surrounding the Southwest Airlines stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-
year earnings being revised in excess of 100% upward over the past 60 days. LUV has a Growth Style Score of B.

Jun 07, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - June 7, 2022 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst 
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United Airlines UAL[1], Delta Air Lines DAL[2], 
Southwest Airlines LUV[3], American Airlines AAL[4], and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). Here are highlights from 
Monday's Analyst Blog:Airlines Looking Good Despite Steep Fuel Costs - Here's Why: The steep oil price increase 
(up 33% in first-quarter 2022) does not bode well for the ZacksAirline[5]industry players as far as their bottom-line 
growth is concerned. This is because fuel expenses form a chunk of the input costs borne by the aviation space. 
That the oil price will be high at least in the near term can be gauged from the forecast given by the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA). Per EIA, the average Brent crude oil spot price will be $107 a barrel in second-
quarter 2022 and $103 in the second half of 2022. Akin to the first quarter, high fuel costs are likely to dent the 
airlines' bottom-line growth in the June quarter. The spike in a major input cost is likely to shoot up the airfares, thus 
making air-travel costlier. 
Despite the exorbitant air fares, stocks in the industry have gained 17% over the past three months. 
Let's delve deep to unearth the reasons for the upbeat stock price performance despite the sharp rally in the bulk 
input cost for the industry participants. 
The sole reason behind this upward stock movement is the buoyancy in demand for air-travel. That the fuel cost-
induced hike in air-ticket price is not dampening demand can be figured out from the assertion of United Airlines' 
CEO Scott Kirby. Per Kirby, there is "not a hint of evidence" that the rising ticket prices are hurting consumer 
demand. 
In response to the bullish demand scenario as highlighted by the healthy trend witnessed with respect to air-travel 
(mainly for leisure) bookings, the UAL management raised its current-quarter outlook for unit revenues. In an SEC 
filing dated May 16, UAL's management projected total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of 
unit revenue) for second-quarter 2022 to increase in the 23-25% band from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Per 
the previous TRASM forecast, given last month while releasing first-quarter 2022 results, the metric was expected 
to improve roughly 17% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights United Airlines , Delta Air Lines , Southwest Airlines , American Airlines , 
and Ryanair Holdings
United Airlines apart, other U.S. carriers, including the likes of Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines 
and others lifted their respective second-quarter views for revenues. 
Delta expects June quarter's adjusted total revenues to be fully restored to the 2019 level. Previously, the airline 
had expected the same to have recovered 93-97% from the 2019 level. DAL anticipates total unit revenues to rise 
seven to eight points from its initial expectations. 
Operating margin is predicted to be 13-14% compared with the previous guidance of 12-14%. Fuel price per gallon 
is now estimated to be $3.60-$3.70 in the second quarter, higher than the previous guidance of $3.20-$3.35. 
Driven by the continued strength witnessed with respect to passenger yield, Southwest Airlines' management 
expects second-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 12-15% band from the earlier estimate of an 8-
12% rise. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now forecast in the $3.30-$3.40 range (earlier forecast was in the 
$3.05-$3.15 band). Management at LUV, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), said that the yield 
strength, driven by upbeat demand, more than offset the fuel price increase. You can seethe complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Alaska Air currently expects total revenues to increase 12-14% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Earlier 
expectation was for a 5-8% increase. Driven by upbeat demand, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) is 
anticipated in the 87-88% range (earlier expectation was in the 85-88% band). Due to high oil price, the current-
quarter economic fuel cost per gallon forecast is raised to the $3.65-$3.68 range from the $3.25-$3.30 band 
expected earlier. However, like LUV, ALK's management is of the view that the revenue strength is offsetting 
increases in oil prices. 
American Airlines also increased its second-quarter revenue guidance owing to upbeat air-travel demand. AAL 
expects total revenues to rise between 11% and 13% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation 
was an increase in the 6- 8% range). 
TRASM is now anticipated to be 20-22% higher than the second-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 14-
16% rise). Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated in the 4-6% 
range compared with the 3-5% band expected earlier. Due to high oil price, the current-quarter average fuel cost 
per gallon forecast is raised to the $3.92-$3.97 range from the $3.59-$3.64 band expected earlier. 
The upbeat demand scenario is aiding not only the U.S. carriers. In May, the European carrier Ryanair Holdings 
stated that load factor is expected to reach the pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in the months of June-August. The 
rosy forecast comes on the back of healthy bookings for summer travel. 
Per CEO Michael O'Leary, "Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen - both the 
numbers are strengthening and average fares being paid through the summer are rising." O'Leary added that 
bookings are especially strong to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. Wrapping Up This optimistic air-
travel demand scenario, driven by wide-spread vaccination against COVID-19 and the easing of travel restrictions, 
is a huge positive for the airlines. As highlighted by the sunny top-line forecasts, passenger revenues, accounting 
for bulk of an airline's top line, are likely to be strong in the second quarter of 2022. In fact, we expect this favorable 
top-line scenario to aid the aviation space throughout the ongoing year.

 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

Jun 03, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With air-travel demand increasing by the day as reflected in the northbound trend in bookings, Delta Air Lines 
DAL[1] and Hawaiian Holdings HA[2] provided an improved view for their respective second-quarter 2022 revenues. 
Meanwhile, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] turned down Dublin Airport Authority's (DAA) application 
for an 88% increase in airport charges at Dublin, terming it 'unjustified and unwarranted' in the current scenario. 
Frontier Group Holdings ULCC[4], the parent company of Frontier Airlines, decided to sweeten its pot regarding its 
buyout offer to Spirit Airlines SAVE[5]. The move to introduce a clause pertaining to a reverse termination fee 
comes ahead of the SAVE shareholders' vote on the Frontier deal, scheduled to be held on Jun 10. Recap of the 
Latest Top Stories 1.On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, Delta, currently sporting a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), expects June quarter's adjusted total revenues to be fully restored to the 2019 level. 
Previously, the airline had expected the same to have recovered 93-97% from the 2019 level. DAL anticipates total 
unit revenues to increase seven to eight points from its initial expectations. However, the carrier now expects 
second-quarter 2022 capacity to be 82-83% of the second-quarter 2019 actuals. The earlier expectation was 84%. 
The operating margin is predicted to be 13-14% compared with the previous guidance of 12-14%. The guided range 
is less than the 2019 level by three to four points due to lower capacity and higher fuel prices. Fuel price per gallon 
is now estimated[6] to be $3.60-$3.70 in the second quarter of 2022, higher than the previous guidance of $3.20-
$3.35. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7]. 
2. Hawaiian Holdings now expects total revenues to decline 4.5-7.5% from the second-quarter 2019 level compared 
with the previous estimation of a decrease of around 8-12%. The improved guidance is due to an uptick in domestic 
yields. HA now anticipates second-quarter 2022 capacity to decline 11.5-13.5% from the comparable period's level 
in 2019. The previous view was a decrease of about 11.5-14.5%. With rising oil prices, HA now estimates[8] fuel 
price per gallon to be $3.76 compared with the previous view of $3.59. 
3. Per Ryanair's Eddie Wilson, "At a time when Irish air travel and tourism are struggling to recover from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, this application by the DAA for an 88% price increase is unjustified and unwarranted'. Per 
RYAAY's management, Dublin Airport traffic is recovering only due to the government-funded Traffic Recovery 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL , HA's Upbeat Q2 Revenue View, SAVE , RYAAY in Focus
Scheme, which lowers charges at Dublin Airport until March 2023-end. Hence, the 88% price increase from 2023 
onward would be an exploitation of this Government Traffic Recovery Scheme.[9] 
Meanwhile, on the back of improved air-travel demand, RYAAY carried 15.4 million passengers in May 2022, up 
756% year over. The actual figure is in line with the expectation mentioned in the previous week's write-up[10], 
which had indicated that May traffic will exceed 15 million. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) climbed to 
92% in the month from 79% a year ago. 
4. In a move that provides regulatory protection to the shareholders of SAVE, ULCC agreed to pay a $250-million 
reverse breakup fee to Spirit. Such a payment will be made only if the regulators turn down ULCC's proposed 
takeover of SAVE on the grounds of antitrust concerns. We believe that the introduction of the new clause to their 
previously announced merger agreement dated Feb 5, 2022, is a prudent move and may find favor with Spirit 
Airlines' shareholders as they vote on the deal next week. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that almost all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 3.7% to $70.44. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index plummeted 
14.6%.

May 31, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has rejected Dublin Airport Authority's ('DAA') application for an 88% price increase in 
airport charges, citing that the DAA mismanaged COVID-19 recovery, which caused thousands of passengers to be 
stranded in long security queues that wound outside the terminal building. The company feels that Irish air traffic 
and tourism's recovery from the pandemic is possible only through lower airport charges and airfares. Thus, there 
'is no justification for an 88% increase in DAA's already high airport charges'. 
Ryanair further added that Dublin Airport traffic is recovering only due to the government-funded Traffic Recovery 
Scheme, which lowers charges at Dublin Airport until March 2023-end. Hence, the 88% price increase from 2023 
onward would be an exploitation of this Government Traffic Recovery Scheme, feels RYAAY management. 
The DAA is seeking to hike prices because of its higher capital spending on "tunnelling" under existing runways. 
Ryanair CEO, Eddie Wilson, said that instead of 'unnecessary gold-plated facilities', the DAA should focus on 'fixing 
recruitment to deliver an efficient customer service through security'. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price 
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-fundamental/price 
Ryanair 
Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] 
Wilson called on the minister for finance, Paschal Donohoe, to issue a shareholder direction to the DAA to abandon 
any application for cost increases at Dublin Airport so that the Irish aviation, Irish tourism and the DAA can be 
protected from a traffic collapse. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation[4] sector are as follows: 
Golar LNG Limited GLNG[5] flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a stellar earnings surprise 
history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed 
once, the average surprise being 42.1%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Shares of Golar LNG have rallied more than 100% in a year. 
Star Bulk Carriers SBLK[7] carries a Zacks Rank #1. The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 7.1%. 
Shares of Star Bulk have gained more than 96% in a year. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Rejects DAA's Proposal for 88% Price Increase
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

May 27, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With air-travel demand increasing by the day as reflected in the northbound trend in bookings, Southwest Airlines 
LUV[1] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] raised their respective forecasts for second-quarter 2022 revenues. Also 
driven by strong bookings, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] anticipates load factor (percentage of 
seats occupied by passengers) to reach pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in June-August. Ryanair was also recently 
in the news when it reported narrower-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. That story 
was reported in details in the previous week's write-up.[4] 
Alaska Air Group ALK[5] also grabbed the headlines, thanks to its labor problems that saw its pilots voting to 
authorize a strike in case the ongoing negotiations with the management on a new contract (the deadlock persists 
for more than three years) ultimately fizzle out. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines DAL[6] decided to trim its summer 
schedule to dodge travel disruptions during the busy season. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 On the back of 
upbeat air-travel demand, Ryanair expects traffic for the month of May to exceed 15 million passengers. The 
reading in April was14.24 million. Load factor is expected to be 92% in May, indicating growth from 91% in April. 
Per CEO, Michael O'Leary, "Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen - both the 
numbers are strengthening and average fares being paid through the summer are rising." O'Leary added that 
bookings are especially strong for travel to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece[7]. 
2.. Highlighting the labor trouble, which has been hurting the U.S. Airline industry of late, Alaska Air's pilots voted 
overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if an agreement on a new employment contract fails to materialize. This 
development was confirmed by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). ALPA represents the 3,000 plus pilots at 
Alaska Air, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 96% of pilots participated in the voting procedure with 99% 
supporting the call of a strike by union leaders if the talks with the airline, which have been prolonged for more than 
three years, eventually falls through. However, the vote to authorize a strike does not imply that passengers of 
Alaska Air will be inconvenienced. The pilots can halt work and go on a strike only if the National Mediation Board 
allows them to take this drastic step. So, ALK's operations are currently in no way impacted[8] 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9]. 
3. Driven by the continued strength witnessed with respect to passenger yield, Southwest Airlines' management 
expects second-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 12-15% band from the earlier estimate of an 8-
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV , JBLU 's Rosy Q2 Revenue Views, ALK 's Labor Woes & More
12% increase. The same is compared with the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Capacity is still expected to decline 
around 7% in the current quarter from the second-quarter 2019 level. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now 
forecast in the $3.30-$3.40 range (earlier forecast was in the $3.05-$3.15 band). Management said that the yield 
strength, driven by upbeat demand, more than offset the fuel price increase. LUV still expects cost per available 
seat miles or CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 14-18% in the 
ongoing quarter from the comparable period's level in 2019. 
4. Driven by a strong demand environment, JetBlue Airways' management expects revenues for second-quarter 
2022 to be 'at or above high-end' of the earlier expectation of an 11-16% increase. The metric is also compared 
with the second-quarter 2019 actuals. On the back of a healthy completion factor so far this quarter, capacity is now 
expected to increase in the 2-3% band (earlier expectation for the second-quarter 2022 capacity was either flat or 
an increase up to 3% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals). JBLU still expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and 
profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 15-17% in the ongoing quarter from the comparable period's 
level in 2019. Fuel price per gallon is now expected to be $4.08 compared with the earlier estimate of $3.79. 
5. To improve operational reliability as air-travel demand bounces back from the pandemic lows, Delta's 
management confirmed that in the Jul 1-Aug 7 time frame, it will reduce services by roughly 100 daily departures. 
The cuts will be primarily in the US and Latin America markets. Highlighting the buoyant air-travel demand scenario, 
DAL anticipates to carry 2.5 million customers this Memorial Day weekend. The projection, if comes true, would 
mean a 25% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Performance The following table shows the price 
movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, driven by the optimistic 
revenue forecasts for the June quarter as air-travel demand soars. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 3.8% 
to $70.98. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 11%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? With Delta scheduled to be present at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Jun 1, all eyes will 
be on whether DAL ups its second-quarter 2022 revenue forecast like LUV and JBLU.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is witnessing strong bookings for the summer, with load factor (percentage of seats 
occupied by passengers) expected to reach pre-pandemic levels at 94-95% in June-August a Reuters report[2] 
stated. 
RYAAY CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters, "Bookings over the last number of weeks have continued to strengthen 
- both the numbers are strengthening and average fares being paid through the summer are rising." O'Leary added 
that bookings are especially strong to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. 
The European carrier expects its traffic to be more than 15 million passengers in May, up from 14.24 million in April.

Ryanair did not raise concerns about the impact of the European Central Bank's expected rate hikes on travel 
demand in the near term. 
Regarding worries over rising fuel costs, O'Leary said that Ryanair has "80% of its fuel needs hedged out to March 
of 2023 at $70 a barrel." 
RYAAY recently reported its fiscal 2022 results[5], wherein its traffic soared more than 200% year over year to 97.1 
million. Load factor in the period was 82%, reflecting an improvement of 11 percentage points from the year-ago 
period. The company expects fiscal 2023 traffic to be 165 million, higher than the fiscal 2022 figure, as well as 149 
million registered in fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). It expects to return to profitability in fiscal 2023. Zacks Rank & Key

Here's Why Investors Should Give Ryanair (RYAAY) a Miss Now

May 24, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is currently mired in multiple headwinds, which we believe, have made it an 
unimpressive investment option. 
Let's delve deeper. 
An Underperformer: The Ryanair stock has declined 15.1% year to date compared with itsindustry[2]'s 9.3% fall in 
the same time frame. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Moreover, RYAAY's 
current Momentum Style Score [3]of F shows its short-term unattractiveness. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[4] 
Southward Earnings Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has been 
revised 41.9% downward over the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 
12.9% south in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers' lack of confidence in the 
stock. 
Bearish Industry Rank:Theindustryto which Ryanair belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 154 (of 250 
plus groups). Such an unfavorable rank places RYAAY in the bottom 39% of the Zacks industries. Studies show 
that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to. 
A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, reckoning 
the industry's performance becomes imperative. 
Other Headwinds: Ryanair is being hit by lower average fares (down 27% year over year in fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 
31, 2022) due to coronavirus concerns and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is limiting top-line growth. RYAAY 
expects fares to continue to be suppressed over the near term. 
Additionally, escalating fuel prices (up more than 200% year over year in fiscal 2022) pose a threat to Ryanair's 
bottom line. Total operating expenses rose more than 100% year over year in fiscal 2022, with a substantial 
increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. Airline Stocks to Consider Investors interested in the 
ZacksAirline industry may consider stocks like Delta Air Lines DAL[5], Southwest Airlines LUV[6] and Alaska Air 
Group ALK[7]. 
Here's Why Investors Should Give Ryanair (RYAAY) a Miss Now
Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Anticipating travel-demand to 
increase further, DAL provided a bullish outlook for the second quarter. DAL expects revenue recovery to 
accelerate to 93-97% in the second quarter, with unit revenues likely to rise in double digits from the second-quarter 
2019 tally. 
Delta expects to generate a strong free cash flow in the June quarter. DAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The 
positivity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being 
revised 71.6% upward over the past 60 days. DAL has a Growth Style Score[8] of B. 
Continued recovery in air-travel demand bodes well for Southwest Airlines. Anticipating a steady improvement in 
bookings, the carrier expects to reap profits in the remaining three quarters of 2022 as well as for the full year. 
LUV's management predicts operating revenues to increase 8-12% in the second quarter of 2022 from the 
comparable period's level in 2019. LUV is seeing strong bookings for spring and summer travel. 
Southwest Airlines currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The positivity surrounding the stock is evident from the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised more than 100% upward over the past 60 days. 
Like DAL, LUV too has a Growth Style Score of B. 
Like DAL and LUV, Alaska Air expects the air-travel demand scene to get brighter with the summer fast 
approaching. ALK's management predicts a double-digit percentage increase in yield, unit revenues and the pre-tax 
margin in the June quarter from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Moreover, driven by high passenger revenues, 
ALK expects to reap profits from the second quarter onward through 2022. 
Alaska Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The air of optimism surrounding the stock is evident from the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 38% upward over the past 60 days. ALK has a 
Growth Style Score of A. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

May 23, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - May 23, 2022 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:Spirit Airlines SAVE[1], JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[2], United Airlines UAL[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentes GOL[5]. Here are 
highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: JetBlue-Spirit Saga Continues, and More In the past 
week, there were quite a few updates on the impending takeover of Spirit Airlines. On May 16, JetBlue Airways, 
after being rejected initially on May 2, refused to give up and launched a hostile all-cash unsolicited tender offer to 
acquire all the outstanding shares of SAVE's common stock. However, the latter's management stuck to its stance 
and turned down the offer put forth by the former yet again. 
United Airlines'management gave an improved revenue guidance for the June quarter as bookings continue to get 
healthier. In another encouraging update, UAL received the green signal from the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) to operate its fleet of 52 Boeing 777s again. The jets are powered with Pratt & Whitney engines. 
The planes have been grounded since February 2021 after a Honolulu-bound flight suffered an engine failure and 
made an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport. On the earnings front, Ryanair Holdingsreported 
narrower-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022). 
Also, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentesannounced that there will be a change at its helm with a 
new CEO in place from July this year. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.In an SEC filing dated May 16, United 
Airlines' management projected total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) for 
second-quarter 2022 to increase in the 23-25% band from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Per the previous 
TRASM forecast, given last month while releasing first-quarter 2022 results, the metric was expected to increase 
roughly 17% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. 
However, due to rising oil prices, UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), increased its average aircraft fuel 
price per gallon forecast for the June quarter. Management now expects[6]the metric to be $4.02, higher than the 
previous estimate of $3.43.

2. In a letter addressed directly to the Spirit Airlines shareholders, JetBlue on May 16 tweaked its purchase price to 
$30 per share (without interest and less any required withholding taxes). At that time, SAVE's board of directors 
advised its shareholders against taking any rash action at the moment and decided that the board will first carefully 
review JetBlue's tender offer[8]. After reviewing, SAVE's board urged its shareholders to reject the $30 per share 
cash tender offer, citing regulatory concerns. 
3. Ryanair incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. However, the amount of loss 
narrowed significantly year over year. 
Quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356.3 million but improved 
significantly year over year with higher traffic despite lower average fares (down 27% year over year due to 
Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Ryanair expects summer 2022 average fares to be 
higher than the summer 2019 level. 
RYAAY expects fiscal 2023 traffic to be 165 million, higher than the fiscal 2022 figure as well as 149 million 
registered in fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). RYAAY anticipates a return to profitability in fiscal 2023[9]. 
4. Gol Linhas announced that its President and CEO Paulo Kakinoff is set to shift from his current position to 
become a member of the board of directors. Kakinoff will be succeeded by Celso Ferrer, the vice president of 
operations. This transition will be effective Jul 1, 2022. Celso joined GOL in 2003 and has served the carrier in 
various capacities ever since[10]. 
GOL was also in the news recently when it reported impressive traffic numbers for April, driven by the improving air-
travel demand scenario in Brazil. That story was covered in detail in last week's write-up[11]. Performance The 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 3.8% to $69.37. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
declined 19.5%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With the first-quarter 2022 earnings season over for the airlines,

 NOW HIRING: Multiple Positions Available![1] Get the latest creative news from FooBar about art, design and 
business. It was seen recently on Twitter that Magic Eden was being 'sassy' to OpenSea and mocking them on 
Twitter after the primarily Ethereum-based marketplace, OpenSea, Tweeted about Solana projects. 
Magic Eden seemingly still thinks that they're still the Solana leaders, and don't want to hand that title to OpenSea. 
In the past while, major companies' social media managers have taken a funny stance on their content strategy, 
from Ryanair to Duolingo just to name a few. Now, Magic Eden is the next on this, as they have mocked their new 
competitor OpenSea on the Twitter platform. OpenSea's original Tweet simply said: 'A Solana project thread' which 
was followed by many Solana projects that they liked. Then, Magic Eden savagely replied[2]: 'a sOlAnA pRojEcT 
tHrEaD. This is what happens when you don't DYOR' in a clearly sarcastic tone. This response Tweet has 'ratioed' 
OpenSea's original Tweet as it sits on 3,032 likes at the time of writing, with OpenSea's sitting at only 2,217. This 
sarcastic response makes it clear that Magic Eden still feels that they're the leader in the Solana space. This is 
despite the fact that OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace all in, has just stepped into the blockchain. Magic Eden 
is the established brand in the Solana space, whereas OpenSea is the established brand in the Ethereum space. 
Should they just stay in their own lane? That's the question. After OpenSea has only ever really worked within 
Ethereum (and Polygon) based NFTs, they have lately stepped into the Solana ecosystem. Solana is certainly one 
of Ethereum's biggest competitors for blockchains. Now, OpenSea is in a Solana beta stage, allowing users to buy 
and sell Solana NFTs on their marketplace in beta. The move to Solana, alongside Ethereum, makes sense for 
OpenSea. Not only does it broaden their audience, but it also allows them to have support for an eco-friendly 
blockchain. Further, it can allow its users to buy and sell certain NFTs with lower gas fees, and fast transactions. 
However, Magic Eden is still the clear leader in Solana. In the past few weeks, as Ethereum has seen a decrease, 
Solana has increased drastically in sales. Solana has always been around, with Magic Eden and Solanart being the 
leading marketplaces. However, Ethereum fans have often looked down upon the Solana blockchain, naming it a 
worse blockchain. Magic Eden is a Solana NFT marketplace and is the market leader in the space. It allows users 
to create, buy and sell NFTs on the Solana blockchain. They have a general marketplace, and also have a minting 
launchpad built into the platform. Here, certain projects, chosen by the company, can mint their NFTs if Magic Eden 
Magic Eden Gets Sassy To Opensea On Twitter About Solana NFTs - NFTevening.com
feels that they're good enough. Sadly, through this minting launchpad, some projects including Balloonsville turned 
out to be rug pulls[3]. Magic Eden was criticised massively for the things that you needed to get into it. In the case 
of Balloonsville, they apparently weren't even asked for ID. Are you tired of missing important NFT drops? Just

May 20, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Euroseas Ltd. ESEA[1] is slated to release first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers on May 23, after market close. 
The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, 
while missing the same in the other two. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for Euroseas this earnings season. Factors to Note With economic activities 
gaining momentum, strength in the shipping market is expected to have boosted Euroseas' first-quarter

performance. 
However, high operating expenses due to increased crewing costs for vessels, thanks to coronavirus-related

May 20, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, there were quite a few updates on the impending takeover of Spirit Airlines SAVE[1]. On May 16, 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[2], after being rejected initially on May 2, refused to give up and launched a hostile all-cash 
unsolicited tender offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of SAVE's common stock. However, the latter's 
management stuck to its stance and turned down the offer put forth by the former yet again. 
United Airlines' UAL[3] management gave an improved revenue guidance for the June quarter as bookings 
continue to get healthier. In another encouraging update, UAL received the green signal from the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to operate its fleet of 52 Boeing 777s again. The jets are powered with Pratt & Whitney 
engines. The planes have been grounded since February 2021 after a Honolulu-bound flight suffered an engine 
failure and made an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport. On the earnings front, Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[4] reported narrower-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 
2022). 
Also, Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentes GOL[5] announced that there will be a change at its helm 
with a new CEO in place from July this year. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.In an SEC filing dated May 16, 
United Airlines' management projected total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) 
for second-quarter 2022 to increase in the 23-25% band from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. Per the previous 
TRASM forecast, given last month while releasing first-quarter 2022 results, the metric was expected to increase 
roughly 17% from the second-quarter 2019 actuals. However, due to rising oil price, UAL, currently carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold), increased its average aircraft fuel price per gallon forecast for the June quarter. Management now 
expects[6] the metric to be $4.02, higher than the previous estimate of $3.43. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
2. In a letter addressed directly to the Spirit Airlines shareholders, JetBlue on May 16 tweaked its purchase price to 
$30 per share (without interest and less any required withholding taxes). At that time, SAVE's board of directors 
advised its shareholders against taking any rash action at the moment and decided that the board will first carefully 
review JetBlue's tender offer[8]. After reviewing, SAVE's board urged its shareholders to reject the $30 per share 
cash tender offer, citing regulatory concerns.

3. Ryanair incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. However, the amount of loss 
narrowed significantly year over year. Quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $1,356.3 million but improved significantly year over year with higher traffic despite lower average fares 
(down 27% year over year due to Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Ryanair expects 
summer 2022 average fares to be higher than the summer 2019 level. RYAAY expects fiscal 2023 traffic to be 165 
million, higher than the fiscal 2022 figure as well as 149 million registered in fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). RYAAY 
anticipates a return to profitability in fiscal 2023[9]. 
4. Gol Linhas announced that its President and CEO Paulo Kakinoff is set to shift from his current position to 
become a member of the board of directors. Kakinoff will be succeeded by Celso Ferrer, the vice president of 
operations. This transition will be effective Jul 1, 2022. Celso joined GOL in 2003 and has served the carrier in 
various capacities ever since[10]. 
GOL was also in the news recently when it reported impressive traffic numbers for April, driven by the improving air-
travel demand scenario in Brazil. That story was covered in detail in last week's write-up[11]. Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, led by the upsurge in 
the Spirit Airlines stock. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 3.8% to $69.37. Over the past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 19.5%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With the first-quarter 2022 
earnings season over for the airlines, watch this space for the usual news updates.

 Golar LNG Limited GLNG[1] is slated to release first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers on May 26[2]. 
The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 
three of the preceding four quarters while missing the same in one. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for Golar LNG this earnings season: Factors to Note European countries 
looking for gas outside Russia amid the war tensions are likely to have driven demand for LNG vessels. This is 
expected to have aided Golar LNG's first-quarter performance. Golar LNG Limited Price and EPS Surprise

Improved performance of the shipping unit is expected to have aided the company's top line. Upbeat operations at 
FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas) Hilli Episeyo are likely to have driven GLNG's first-quarter performance. 
Reduced vessel operating expenses are likely to have aided Golar LNG's bottom line in the first quarter. However,

100% year over year. Adjusted revenues of $115.4 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $114 million. The

 Reallocating a significant part of its capacity to the strongest markets and radically optimizing the network has been 
instrumental in reducingeasyJet's[1] losses in its first half-year of FY22. The European airline reported a 545 million 
headline loss before tax for the period, an improvement of some 150 million. easyJet benefits from capacity 
reallocation. 
In HY1, easyJet reallocated 1.5 million seats from weaker markets to stronger (leisure) markets, launching 48 new 
routes since January. It continues to build on this by adding capacity at Manchester (plus two aircraft to twenty), 
Milan Linate (plus three to 25), and Paris (plus one to 22) while doubling the fleet at destinations bases from nine to 
nineteen. This includes Greece and Portugal. The carrier will add domestic capacity in the UK and France as well 
as capacity at slot-constrained airports like Gatwick, Porto, Lisbon, and Linate. 
Chief Commercial Officer Sophie Dekker noted that together with Ryanair, easyJet is the only airline to actually add 
capacity for the summer. All legacy airlines in Europe (its main competitors on two-thirds of easyJet's network) and 
even Wizz Air have cut capacity in Q4 by high single-digit to double-digit teen numbers. Compared to 2019 levels, 
there are 46 million fewer seats in the European market. After securing more slots, easyJet will strengthen capacity 
at London Gatwick. As it capitalizes on the reduced size of British Airways at Gatwick, easyJet is now the biggest 
airline in the London area for the first time ever. 
Leisure capacity around Easter was 115 percent of 2019 levels, with load factors up to ninety percent again. Since 
the lifting of Covid restriction in the UK, bookings have been strong: in the last ten weeks, they were up six percent 
on pre-Covid levels. easyJet expects capacity in the current third quarter (April-June) to reach ninety percent op 
2019 and 97 percent in Q4. CEO Johan Lundgren is particularly happy with the strong bookings at easyJet 
Holidays, which are up by 530 percent from 2019. Holidays should contribute to FY22 passenger numbers by some 
1.1 million, adding 100 million in incremental mid-term profit to the Group. 
Ancillary revenues up by 44 percent 
easyJet reported a headline loss before tax was 545 million versus -701 million, in line with itsguidance from 
April.[2] Group EBITDAR was -208 million versus -469 million. Fuel costs increased to 362 million, up from 97 
million, although effective fuel costs per metric tonne were lower. Headline costs excluding fuel were also 
significantly higher to 1.344 billion from 612 million, reflecting higher operating costs from more flying compared to 
the weak 2020-2021 period offset by lower crew, maintenance, and ownership costs. 
easyJet benefits from capacity reallocation
The airline carried 23.4 million passengers, up from 4.1 million the previous year, with Q1 and Q2 about even at 
some 11.6 million. Total revenues increased to 1.498 billion from 240 million, of which 985 million from passenger 
revenues. Revenues per seat were up by 29 percent to 47.61 as load factors increased to on average 77.3 percent 
and even 81 percent in February and March. Ancillary revenues per seat from seat and baggage reservations 
increased by 44 percent to 15.12 or 513 million in total. The airline is seeing benefits from new ancillary products 
that in introduced a year ago. It plans another 'step change' in ancillary revenues. 
The Group ended the year with 3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and money deposits. It repaid 300 million in 
commercial paper and has no maturities until FY23. Net debt stood at 596 million, down from 2.098 billion the year 
before. Net cash generation in HY1 was 109 million and a cash outflow of 159 million.

easyJet has various options to grow or reduce its fleet by adding new aircraft and/or terminating leases. (easyJet) 
Flexibility to grow or reduce the fleet 
easyJet ended the first half-year with a fleet of 322 aircraft, which will grow to 324 by year-end. It projects deliveries 
of nine aircraft in FY22, six in FY23, eighteen in FY24, and 26 in FY25. At the same time, it will start phasing out its 
99 Airbus A319s until 2027 and replace them with higher-capacity A320neo's and A321neo's, of which another 115 
remain on backlog plus 59 purchase options and purchase rights. How it will split deliveries between the two 
variants is still subject to confirmation, but by adding the Neo's, easyjet can upgauge capacity without adding more 
aircraft. Chief Financial Officer Kenton Jarvis said that the fleet could grow to 337 aircraft by FY25, but the carrier 
could also reduce the number to 276 by not extending current lease contracts. Following the sanctions on Russia, 
easyJet returned six aircraft that were sourced from lessors that had ties with Russia.  
Lundgren said that easyJet will keep a strict eye on labor costs by improving productivity and through seasonal 
contracts. Like other airlines, it has been confronted with labor market issues that forced it to cancel many flights in 
April. In response, the airline has taken the odd decision to leave one seat row per aircraft unused to reduce the 
number of cancelations if it would be forced to do so. With new recruitment programs in place, Lundrgen says 'we 
believe we have the right amount of crew for the summer period.' The airline is prepared to pay extra to staff in 
crucial positions like ground handling and airport operations to secure adequate staffing. 
Given the continued short-term uncertainties, easyJet isn't giving guidance on the full year. Forward bookings might 
be positive but remain close in. The airline is not so worried about fuel costs as it has hedged 71 percent of its fuel 
for HY2 at an average of $619 per metric tonne, 49 percent for HY1 2023, and twenty percent for HY2 2023. 
It is also hedged by eighty percent for dollar fluctuations this year and 100 percent on offsetting carbon credits. The 
airline said today that it has updated its interim target of emission reductions, targeting now a 35 percent 
improvement by 2035 compared to an FY2020 baseline. The revised target is based on its Science-Based Targets 
Initiative tool. Since 2000, easyJet claims to have reduced carbon emissions per passenger by 33 percent. 
Improvements must come from fleet renewal, operational efficiencies, improvements in air traffic management, and 
scaling up the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Earlier this week, we discusses easyJet's sustainability 
strategy with Director of Flight Operations, David Morgan[3].

IAG finally confirms MAX deal but for fewer aircraft

May 19, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 After two years, eleven months, and one day,International Airlines Group[1] (IAG) finally confirmed its intention to 
buy the Boeing MAX. The airline group said on May 19 that it will purchase 25 MAX 8200s and 25 MAX 10s, plus 
100 options. IAG finally confirms MAX deal but for fewer aircraft. 
On the second day of the 2019 Paris Airshow on June 18, IAG announced a Letter of Intent[2] for up to 200 MAX 8 
and -10 aircraft. That was in the early days of the MAX crisis following the grounding in March after the two fatal 
accidents. The LoI was seen as a morale boost for Boeing from one of the world's leading airline groups, who still 
had confidence in the type despite having no clue how the MAX troubles would be solved. 
Even after the MAX 8 and -9 were recertified again at the end of 2020, IAG failed to confirm its LoI and only said 
that negotiations were ongoing. It made Ryanair's Michael O'Leary question if the IAG order was still on at all or if 
the group was having the same troubles as he had in getting the aircraft at a good price. 
IAG says today in a brief media statement that it has negotiated 'a substantial discount from the list price', which it 
provides at being $120 million for the MAX 8200 and $130 million for the MAX 10. It expects to take delivery of the 
fifty aircraft on firm order between 2023 and 2027 and of the options between 2025 and 2028. If IAG will take only 
newly-built aircraft or gets MAX 8s that have been canceled by other customers isn't known. The order is subject to 
approval from IAG's shareholders. 
Original LoI included the MAX 8 and -10 
In the original LoI, IAG wanted the MAX 8 with around 178 seats and the MAX 10 with 230 seats. The firm order 
sees a preference for the MAX 8200 with up to 200 seats, bringing both versions closer together. The situation of 
the MAX 10 is unclear: if the type fails to be certified this year, Boeing risks being forced to do anextensive systems 
update[3] under new US legislation. This could result in significant delays on entry into service. 
The MAX will be placed with any airline within IAG, so British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia, or Vueling. This is in line 
with what then-CEO Willie Walsh said in June 2019, when he stated that by acquiring the MAX, IAG would diversify 
its fleet to spur competition. When Walsh made his remark, IAG was not happy at all with thelate Airbus 
deliveries[4] and used Boeing as a stick to lever his position. 
IAG has been a loyal customer of Airbus and operates a huge fleet of A320ceo and A320neo family aircraft. Most of 
the deliveries to Aer Lingus and BA have been completed, but Iberia and Vueling recently added or swapped orders 
IAG finally confirms MAX deal but for fewer aircraft
for A321neo's. In the distant past, BA, Aer Lingus, and Iberia used to operate the 737-200, 737 Classic, and an odd 
737-800. 
'The addition of new Boeing 737s is an important part of IAGs short-haul fleet renewal. These latest-generation 
aircraft are more fuel-efficient than those they will replace and in line with our commitment to achieving net-zero 
carbon emissions by 2050', Group CEO Luis Gallego says in a media statement.Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
CEO Stan Deal said: 'Today's agreement for up to 150 airplanes, including 100 options, is a welcome addition of 
the 737 to IAGs short-haul fleets and reflects our commitment to support the Group's continued network recovery 
and future growth with Boeing's unrivaled family of airplanes.'

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] incurred a loss (excluding 50 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share in 
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 
$1.11. However, the amount of loss narrowed significantly year over year. Results were hurt by the impact of 
Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine war on travel demand. 
Quarterly revenues of $1,319.6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356.3 million but improved 
significantly year over year with increase in traffic despite lower average fares (down 27% year over year due to 
Omicron-induced woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Fiscal 2022 Results Ryanair's net loss came in at 
€355 million in fiscal 2022 compared with the year-ago period's loss of €1,015 million. Traffic soared more than 
200% year over year to 97.1 million (but still down 35% from pre-pandemic levels). Load factor in the period was

 Wizz Air [1]plans to launch operations in October with a new subsidiary based in Malta. The launch date is subject 
to regulatory approval from the Maltese Civil Aviation Directorate (CAD) and Europe's EASA. Wizz Air plans to 
launch Maltese subsidiary in October. 
Wizz announced on May 17 that it has signed a document with both agencies, with the intention to file for an Air 
Operator Certificate with EASA and an Operating Licence with the CAD. The airline already operates under an 
EASA license with multiple AOCs in different member states, including Hungary, Bosnia, and Ukraine. Wizz also 
has independent certificates for its operations in the UK and Abu Dhabi. It said last week that it is exploring options 
for a new subsidiary in Saudi Arabia[2]. 
On its plans for the Maltese airline, CEO Joszef Varadi says in a media statement: 'The successful establishment of 
Wizz Air Malta later this year will help to reinforce our strong position and support our expansion plans in Europe.' 
Until now, the airline has no base on Malta but has grown its presence in nearby Italy, with 22 aircraft based at 
seven different airports. The airline hasn't shared further details of its plans in Malta. If the new subsidiary is in 
some ways a substitute for Wizz' paused operations in Ukraine isn't confirmed. Wizz reported a €-213.6 million 
operating loss in Q3 of FY22.[3]  
Entering the Maltese market brings Wizz Air is direct competition with its main low-cost rival in Europe, Ryanair[4]. 
Through Malta Air, which became operational in June 2019, Ryanair has based 145 Boeing 737-800s and MAX 
8200s on the island to cover markets around the Mediterranean. Since September 2020, the 29 Airbus A320s for 
Lauda Europe also operate with a Maltese AOC. Previously, they were based in Vienna.

May 16, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 The recovery of air travel remains so fragile and financial headwinds are so strong thatRyanair[1] only can say that 
it hopes to return to 'reasonable profitability' in the current FY23. Close-in bookings, low fares, high fuel prices, and 
significant risks from the war in Ukraine and Covid are all disclaimers in its guidance for the new financial year, 
Ryanair said on May 16 in its FY22 results presentation. 
The fragility was confirmed with the emergence of Omicron in December 2021 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
in February, which had an immediate effect on bookings and yields, notably around Easter. The high fuel prices 
forced Ryanair to reduce fares to stimulate travel. Fares are expected to remain under pressure, as has happened 
in previous quarters[2]. While Ryanair is optimistic that it will recover passenger numbers to 165 million from 97.1 
million last year, visibility is too limited right now to provide accurate profit guidance for FY23. 
'There is no doubt that traffic is recovering. We have seen in recent months stronger traffic and higher load factors 
but most of that has been driven by lower fares. In the current first quarter, fares will be below 2019 levels. There is 
a prospect that fares in the September quarter could be ahead of 2019 but that recovery is fragile and could be 
subject to damage quite significantly by adverse news flows', said Michael O'Leary in a prepared presentation. 'But 
we expect Ryanair to grow faster in a recession, as has happened before after 9/11, the Gulf war, and in previous 
economic crises.' 
Full-year loss reduced to 355 million 
Ryanair reduced its FY22 net loss to €-355 million from €-1.015 billion in FY21. The operating loss was €470.1 
million versus €839.4 million. Operating expenses soared to €5.3 billion from €2.5 billion, with fuel costs up by 237 
percent to €1.8 billion and airport handling charges also much higher as traffic increased. 
Total revenues tripled to €4.8 billion from €1.6 billion, of which €2.652 billion is from passenger revenues (FY21: 
€1.036 billion) and €2.148 billion from ancillary revenues (€599.8 million). To stimulate travel, Ryanair lowered its 
fares by an average of 27 percent to €27. The carrier earned on average €22 from ancillary revenues from priority 
boarding and seat reservation. Load factors were up to 82 percent from 71 percent last year. 
Ryanair bolstered its liquidity to €3.6 billion by the end of March compared to €3.2 billion a year earlier. Including its 
assets/fleet, total liquidity stood at €15.2 billion. Net debt was reduced to €1.45 billion from €2.28 billion, with a 
target to get to net-zero debt in FY25 despite the high level of capital expenditure on the fleet. The carrier remains 
committed to restoring in the next three years the five to twenty percent pay cuts for its staff that were imposed at 
Ryanair projects modest profitability in difficult market
the start of the Covid crisis, but negotiations with unions and workforce representatives have yet to produce 
agreements on certain markets. The quicker Ryanair returns to profitability, the quicker the airline will restore the 
pay cuts. The airline says it has no staff shortages but is worried by labor issues at airports and at air navigation 
service providers. 
Ryanair seeking up to fifty second-hand Boeing and Airbus aircraft 
The airline group expects to grow the number of Boeing MAX 8200s for Ryanair, Buzz, and Malta Air from 61 by the 
end of March to seventy this summer, up five from its previous schedule. This has been at Boeing's request. 
Another 55 should join until the coming winter, although Ryanair - like other customers - is struggling to get the 
aircraft on time over supply chain issues. Reliability and fuel consumption of the MAX has exceeded expectations 
while passenger and crews offer positive feedback 
To cope with short and medium-term growth between 2026-2030, Ryanair has submitted requests for proposals for 
up to fifty second-hand, O'Leary said. The airline is in 'advanced discussions with a number of lessors on both 
Airbus and Boeing second-hand aircraft.' But Ryanair prefers to add more MAX to the fleet, especially the MAX 10. 
O'Leary said that he hopes that Boeing 'can finally return to the table' after Ryanair terminated the talks last year 
when Boeing was asking too high prices for the aircraft. O'Leary said in March that he wasin no hurry to get a 
deal[3]. Boeing needs to 'up its game' and win more new orders or risk that Airbus will have it for lunch.

Ryanair claims to have grown its market share in various key markets. (Ryanair) 
The MAX fleet with its high-density cabin should contribute to a capacity increase to 115 percent of 2019 levels this 
summer, with 770 new routes added and fifteen new bases opened. Ryanair expects to gain a forty percent market 
share in Italy, twenty percent in Austria (Vienna), and improve further on the thirty percent in Hungary, 'the home of 
our so-called low-cost competitor.' (Wizz Air). Its share in Ireland is currently at 55 percent, that in Poland at 35 
percent. 
For all airlines, high fuel prices are a big concern, but less so for Ryanair. For FY23, the airline is in a good position 
as it has hedged eighty percent of fuel for mid-sixty to a mid-seventy dollars per barrel with swaps and caps. 'This 
gives us a huge competitive advantage', said O'Leary, who added that the remaining twenty percent still needs to 
be sourced at current high prices. For FY24, ten percent of fuel costs are hedged. The airline has hedged 85 
percent of its carbon credits for FY23.

May 13, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022) financial 
numbers on May 16[2]. 
The company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one 
of the preceding four quarters while missing the same in the other three. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for Ryanair this earnings season. Factors to Note Improved air-travel demand 
in Europe is likely to have driven Ryanair's top line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Uptick in traffic is expected to 
have boosted scheduled revenues in the quarter. Ancillary revenues are also expected to reflect significant year-
over-year improvement owing to strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating. 
However, with air-travel demand continuing to be below the pre-pandemic levels, Ryanair's fiscal fourth-quarter 
performance is likely to reflect softness compared with the 2019 level. 
Additionally, escalating fuel prices amid the Russia-Ukraine war are likely to have dented the carrier's bottom line in 
the 
to-be-reported 
quarter.

Ryanair 
Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4] What the Zacks Model Unveils The proven 
Zacks model predicts an earnings beat for Ryanair this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP[5] 
and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Earnings ESP: Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at a loss of 
$1.08, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or 
sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter[7]. 
Zacks Rank: Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q3 Earnings Ryanair incurred a loss of 48 cents per 
share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Dec 31, 2021), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a 
penny. Results were hurt by Omicron-induced travel restrictions in December. Quarterly revenues of $1,681.1 
million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,792.2 million but increased more than 400% from the year-
ago period, with significant improvement in traffic owing to strong bookings in October and November. Earnings 
Snapshots Within the Zacks Airline[8] industry, Copa Holdings CPA[9], Azul AZUL[10] and Gol Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes GOL[11] recently reported first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?
Copa Holdings, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, reported first-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 23 cents from non-
recurring items) of 70 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. In the year-ago 
quarter, the company had incurred a loss of $2.23 per share due to coronavirus-led depressed air-travel demand. 
Copa Holdings' quarterly revenues of $571.6 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $566.1 million 
and rose significantly year over year, thanks to an improvement in air-travel demand. 
Azul, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding $4.89 from non-recurring items) of $1.14 per share 
in the first quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.21. The amount of loss 
narrowed year over year as well. 
Azul's total revenues of $610.9 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $638.5 million but increased 
82.9% year over year as air-travel demand improved, courtesy of widespread vaccination programs in Brazil.  
Gol Linhas, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding $3.15 from non-recurring items) of 63 cents per 
share in the first quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The amount of 
loss has narrowed year over year. 
Gol Linhas' net operating revenues of $616.2 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $603.2 million. 
The top line not only surged more than 100% year over year, but also came in above the first quarter of 2019.

May 13, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Golden Ocean GroupGOGL[1] is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 [2]results on May 19. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has been steady at 35 cents over the past 60 days. The 
consensus mark for revenues is currently pegged at $192.7 million. 
Against this backdrop, let's discuss the factors that might have impacted Golden Ocean's performance in the March 
quarter. 
We expect GOGL's first-quarter performance to have been driven by the gradual uptick in economic activities. This, 
in turn, might have perked up its revenues from the year-ago quarter's reported figure despite the Omicron-induced 
woes in the early part of the quarter. 
The optimism surrounding the Drybulk market is likely to have boosted Golden Ocean's top line in the to-be-
reported quarter. Revenues are likely to have increased owing to favorable Drybulk freight rates. Efforts to expand 
its fleet size also point to the increasing demand-scenario. 
However, we expect GOGL's first-quarter bottom-line performance to have been hurt by an escalated time charter 
and voyage expenses. Moreover, steep oil price is flaring up fuel costs. This, in turn, is likely to have pushed up the 
operating costs in the to-be-reported quarter. What Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model does not 
conclusively predict an earnings beat for Golden Ocean this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings 
ESP[3] and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, 
that is not the case here as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[4]. 
Earnings ESP:Golden Ocean has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate Estimate is in line with the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with 
ourEarnings ESP Filter[5]. 
Zacks Rank:Golden Ocean currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Highlights of Q4 Earnings Golden Ocean's fourth-
quarter 2021 earnings (excluding a couple of cents from non-recurring items) of 99 cents per share beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. Total revenues of $312.9 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$284.3 million. Stocks to Consider Investors interested in the broaderTransportation[6]sector may considerRyanair 
Holdings (RYAAY) andStar Bulk CarriersSBLK[7] as these stocks possess the right combination of elements to beat 
on earnings this reporting cycle. 
Golden Ocean ( GOGL ) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?
Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #3. RYAAY will announce thefourth-quarter fiscal 2022 
resultson May 16. 
Improving air-travel demand is serving RYAAY well. However, high fuel costs are denting Ryanair's bottom line. 
Star Bulk Carriers has an Earnings ESP of +1.77% and a Zacks Rank #2. SBLK will announce first-quarter 2022 
results on May 24. 
Improvement in travel demand is likely to have boosted Star Bulk's voyage revenues in the March quarter. 
Continued fleet expansion initiatives are also expected to have contributed to SBLK's performance in the to-be-
reported quarter. However, high fuel costs are likely to have stressed SBLK's bottom line.

 Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up 
quite nicely for their report. 
That is because Ryanair is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a 
precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date 
information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RYAAY in this 
report. 
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of $1.08 per share for RYAAY, 
compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11 per share. This suggests that analysts have 
very recently bumped up their estimates for RYAAY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.70% heading into 
earnings season. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price and EPS Surprise https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price-
eps-surprise?icid=chart-RYAAY-price-eps-surprise Ryanair Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[2] | Ryanair Holdings 
PLC Quote[3] Why is this Important? A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful 
in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks 
that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the 
time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here[4]). 
Given that RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock 
ahead of earnings. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5].s 
Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ryanair, and that a beat might 
be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Facemasks scrapped on European flights

 Compulsory wearing of facemasks on flights to and within Europe is to be scrapped. 
The move, under which masks will also no longer be required at airports, was welcomed as 'a big step forward in 
the normalisation of air travel', by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa). 
The policy, announced by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, takes effect on Monday and is 
expected to boost demand for summer holidays. It is also hoped that the change will end the confusion about which 
flights require masks. 
Ryanair, which is Europe's biggest airline, said it would scrap masks on all its flights[1]. All the main British airlines, 
including BA and easyJet, have already eased mask rules on flights to the UK. However, where a destination 
requires masks, passengers are still being told to cover their faces. 
The safety agency and disease control centre are continuing to advise passengers that masks offer 'one of the best 
protections' against Covid. 
Patrick Ky, the Easa executive director, said: 'It is a relief to all of us that we are finally reaching a stage in the 
pandemic where we can start to relax the health safety measures.' 
At least 15 European countries, including Greece and Italy, still require masks on public transport, although the 
number is expected to fall rapidly, according to Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's chief executive. 
Virtually all European countries have ditched passenger locator forms, but Spain, Austria and Germany still require 
unvaccinated passengers to complete one. 
Tests for fully vaccinated passengers have all but been abolished, although some countries require a booster jab. 
The UK scrapped tests for all arrivals and discontinued its passenger locator form in March, one of the first in 
Europe to do so. 
From Monday France will drop its requirement to wear face coverings on public transport, Olivier Vran, the health 
minister has announced. 
Airlines and airports are lobbying officials in the US to drop pre-departure tests for vaccinated passengers, a move 
that would be expected to boost tourism and ease delays at airports. 
Fears of disruption at airports this summer remain after long queues were reported at Manchester and Birmingham 
airports this week, although officials insist that they are working hard to solve the problems. 
Facemasks scrapped on European flights
Speaking at the Airport Operators Association annual dinner in London on Tuesday, Karen Dee, the chief 
executive, said: 'While the majority of people will have travelled without any problem, we do acknowledge that it's 
not always been possible to deliver the kind of smooth experience that passengers have come to expect from us.' 
She insisted that airports were working 'really hard' to recruit and vet staff before the peak summer holidays, 
adding: 'While UK restrictions have thankfully fallen away, a significant proportion of our long-haul flights have not 
yet returned and, in other places, Covid-related additional checks continue prior to departure. This has been a 
contributory factor in some of the disruption in airports particularly over the Easter school holidays.' 
Heathrow announced that five million passengers travelled through its terminals in April, a 848 per cent rise on last 
year when there were tight restrictions.

 In the past week, Spirit Airlines SAVE[1] took a vital decision to reject JetBlue Airways' JBLU[2] enhanced offer to 
get acquired by the latter. Spirit's management cited regulatory risks while rebuffing the offer. Instead, SAVE 
announced that it was sticking to the takeover bid worth $2.9-billion ($6.6 billion when the assumption of net debt 
and operating lease liabilities are considered), put forward by Frontier Group HoldingsULCC[3], the parent company 
of Frontier Airlines, in February. 
Spirit was also in the news on the earnings front as it released s first-quarter 2022 earnings report. Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[4] too released first-quarter 2022 earnings results in the past five trading days. 
With the first-quarter earnings season underway, a plethora of airline releases was also discussed in the previous 
week's write-up[5]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.After consulting legal experts, Spirit's board of directors 
decided that the unsolicited offer worth of $33 per share in cash along with a number of deal sweeteners, received 
from JetBlue, is by no means a 'Superior Proposal' as defined in SAVE's merger agreement with Frontier. 
Per Spirit's chairman of board of directors, Mac Gardner, 'Spirit continues to believe in the strategic rationale of the 
proposed merger with Frontier and is confident that it represents the best opportunity to maximize long-term 
shareholder value. After a thorough review and extensive dialogue with JetBlue, the Board determined that the 
JetBlue proposal involves an unacceptable level of closing risk that would be assumed by Spirit stockholders. We 
believe that our pending merger with Frontier will start an exciting new chapter for Spirit and will deliver many 
benefits to Spirit shareholders, Team Members and Guests." Sprit Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 
(Sell), expects the deal with Frontier to close in the second half of 2022.

2. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] load factor (percentage of seats occupied by passengers) exceeded 90% (91% to 
be exact) in April 2022. This is the first time that the reading attained an astronomical figure ever since the 
pandemic had begun in 2020. In April, Ryanair carried 14.2 million passengers, well above the 11.2 million 
headcount transported in March. The month was the second in a row wherein Ryanair carried more passengers 
than in the corresponding pre-pandemic period. In April, Ryanair operated more than 82,600 flights.

3. Spirit Airlines' loss (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.60 per share was wider than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.54 but narrower than the year-ago quarter's loss of $2.48. In first-quarter 2019 
(pre-coronavirus era), the carrier had reported earnings of 84 cents per share. 
In first-quarter 2022, operating revenues of $967.3 million increased in excess of 100% year over year. The upside 
reflects improving air-travel demand. Revenues were also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $951.3 
million. In first-quarter 2022, passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk of the top line (98.2%), increased 
110.9% year over year (when the impact of coronavirus on air-travel demand was severe) to $949.7 million. 
Passenger revenues were up 13.3% from the first-quarter 2019 actuals. Other revenues surged 60.6% year over 
year to $17.57 million. 
All comparisons (in %) are presented below on a year-over-year basis. 
Reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand, consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) at Spirit 
soared 57.5% in the reported quarter. To cater to this increased demand, capacity (measured in available seat 
miles) expanded to 46.9%. Load factor increased 5.1 points to 77.2% in the first quarter of 2022. Total operating 
revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) jumped 42.7% to 8.25 cents in the reported quarter. The average yield 
surged 33.1% to 10.69 cents. 
Adjusted operating expenses (excluding fuel) escalated 34.5% to $751.1 million. Average fuel cost per gallon in the 
reported quarter rose to $2.41 from $1.32 as oil prices shot up. Fuel gallons consumed skyrocketed 57.6% to 
$123.3 million, reflecting the usage of more planes to cater to upbeat air-travel demand. Adjusted cost per available 
seat miles (CASM) excluding fuel decreased 10.5% in the reported quarter, reflecting the expanded capacity. Spirit 
took the delivery of three new A320neo aircraft during first-quarter 2022. The total number of aircraft in its fleet at 
the end of the quarter was 176. SAVE expects to end 2022 with 197 planes in its fleet. It exited the quarter with 
unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and the liquidity available under the carrier's 
revolving credit facility of $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to the 
purchase of spare parts. 
SAVE expected adjusted operating expenses for the June quarter in the range of $1,335-$1,365 million. Adjusted 
pre-tax margin is expected in the -3 to -5% range. Fuel gallons consumed are expected to be $130.7 million in the 
second quarter. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated in the $3.85-$3.90 range. Effective tax rate is expected to be 
21%. Available seat miles are anticipated to increase roughly 10.5% from second-quarter 2019 actuals. 
4. Allegiant Travel reported first-quarter 2022 loss (excluding 32 cents from non-recurring items) of 12 cents per 
share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at earnings of 10 cents per share. Operating revenues of 
$500.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $494.7 million and increased 79.2% on a year-over-year 
basis. 
Passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk (92.7%) of the top line, soared 80.7% on a year-over-year basis. 
The upside can be attributed to improvement in air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles 
or RPMs) for scheduled service surged 64.2% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat 
miles or ASMs) also increased 15.1% year over year. Load factor widened 2360 basis points to 78.9% in the 
reported quarter, as traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion.  
Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, escalated 66.4% year over year to 7.12 cents. 
Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up 65.4% to $3.01 in the quarter. Total scheduled service passenger 
revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) rose 56.5% to 10.78 cents. ALGT exited the March quarter with 112 
planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2022 is expected to be 124. For second-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon 
is expected to be at $4. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows majority of the airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. The NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index inched up 0.8% to $76.74. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
declined 20%. What's Next in the Airline Space? First-quarter 2022 earnings reports of some Latin American 
carriers are expected in the coming days. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

 In the Netherlands, Ryanair announced a partnership with Neste to power approximately a third of its flights at 
Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend[1]. 
This blend will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%, supporting Ryanair's Pathway to Net Zero by 2050 
decarbonization goals. Ryanair has already significantly advanced this commitment by partnering with Trinity 
College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre and investing $22 billion in its 
'Gamechanger' fleet, which offers 4% more seats but are 16% more fuel & CO2 efficient and reduce noise 
emissions by 40%.

Apr 09, 2022( Dale & Co.: http://www.iaindale.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 From a listener to my LBC show... 
I'm a big fan, I listen to your show every day. This is about a Passport disappointment (I can't say passport hell 
because there's so much going on in this world). BUT, I think people need to be warned about this because lots of 
family's getting caught out at airports and sent home. I was travelling to Italy yesterday with my wife and four young 
boys, already checked in and ready to travel, only to be stopped at passport control and told I couldn't travel on my 
fully valid British/EU Passport because although it has 1-year until expiry, the EU no longer accept passports older 
than ten years (mine was ten years and a few days). 
Furthermore, we were sent to Ryanair Customer services to be told by their Italian representative that 'it's our own 
fault for leaving the EU' and that it's also our fault for lying when completing the online checkin. LYING just what you 
need at a time like this. They said we were lying because I put in the expiry date printed on my passport and not the 
expiry date I should have calculated from the issue dateso the passport expiry date for EU countries is irrelevant! 
Thepassport has to be within 9-years and 9 months or six depending on which European country. 
So, Iphoned the passport office and left my number, they promptly called me back and suggested I go to the 
passport office in Eccleston Square in Londonand get a same day emergency passport. 
Great I thought. So I insisted my wife kids travel without me, I'd go to London, update my passport and catch them 
up Monday latest. Off they went sobbing. One of my little boys had a panick attack on the flight but need to say he's 
okay now. 
Get to the passport office and join the queue. WOWso much pushing and shoving and shouting from other people. 
It was awful. Every time I got to the front, someone who'd already been chased off jumped back in front. Everyone 
with their own issue. 
Well the UK's idea of an emergency passport is earliest appointment 18-days later. I would imagine it's no longer an 
emergency three weeks later!?! 
And I was not the only one caught out like this. There were four other people in my queue traveling with young kids, 
only to be told the same thing. 
There is nothing I can see on the UK passport website which warns you about this, it just states that so long as you 
have more than six months on your passport it is valid. But EU countries no longer accept this. 
Iain, Please warn people about this so they don't turn up at the airport and get turned away.It would be so helpful if 
you could help spread the message to warn people that the expiry date on their British passport doesn't matter. EU 
If You're Going to Italy (or the Rest of the EU): A Warning
countries are deciding if a passport is valid or not and their criteria is sometimes different from country to country. 
Lots of people getting caught out on this. 
You have been warned. And it seems this isn't just concerning Italy, it's the whole of the EU. I always thought as 
long as you had 6 months left on your passport you were OK to travel. Not to the EU, it seems, any longer. The 
date of expiration on my listener's passport was 1 December 2022.

Apr 07, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, JetBlue Airways JBLU[1] offered $3.6 billion to buy Spirit Airlines SAVE[2]. JetBlue's $3.6-billion 
bid, equivalent to $33 per share in cash, represents a premium of 50% to its closing share price on Apr 4, 2022. 
European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was also in the news owing to its upbeat traffic. Owing to the sunny 
scenario with respect to passenger traffic, RYAAY narrowed its forecast for fiscal 2022 net loss. Delta Air Lines 
DAL[4] was another newsmaker, courtesy of its fleet-modernization exercise. Gol Linhas' GOL[5] March traffic 
report was impressive, reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand in Brazil. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. 
JetBlue's all-cash offer, on materialization, would create the fifth-largest domestic airline, giving tough competition 
to the big four U.S. carriers. The Spirit Airlines deal is expected to help JetBlue expand its footprint in New York and 
Florida. The merger will help JBLU expand across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America. The 
combined entity would offer more than 1,700 daily flights to over 130 destinations in 27 countries. The transaction is 
expected to generate $600-700 million in net annual synergies upon completion of integration. The combined 
company is predicted to generate annual revenues of approximately $11.9 billion (based on 2019 revenues). 
Excluding integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to JetBlue's earnings per share in the first 
full year.[6] 
JetBlue was also in the news recently when it decided to add 5,000 jobs in the New York City this year to meet the 
uptick in air-travel demand. The story was covered in the previous week's write-up[7]. 
2. To modernize its fleet, Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), announced that it will start operating its 
first of 155 new Airbus A321neo aircraft from May 20, 2022. The debut flight using a new aircraft will take off from 
Delta's Boston hub and head for San Fransisco. In the coming months, Delta will further expand flight services on 
the Airbus A321neo plane to include destinations like Denver, San Diego and Seattle. While flights to Seattle will 
begin operating on Aug 11, services to San Diego and Denver will commence from Aug 20[8]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9]. 
3. Owing to expanded passenger volumes, Ryanair now expects a loss in fiscal 2022 in the €350-€400 million 
range. The earlier outlook was of a loss in the €250-€450 million band. The forecast of a narrower loss comes on 
the back of an uptick in air traffic at Ryanair for the month of March, which exceeded the pre-pandemic levels. 
Airline Stock Roundup: JBLU 's $3.6 B Bid to Buy SAVE , RYAAY's Better View & More
Evidently, in March 2022, RYAAY transported 11.2 million passengers[10], above the 0.5 million carried in March 
2021, 5.5 million in March 2020 and 10.9 million in the pre-pandemic era of March 2019. 
4. In March, Gol Linhas' consolidated traffic jumped 113.9% year over year. To match the increased demand 
situation, GOL is expanding its capacity. In the same month, capacity grew 93% year over year. Since traffic growth 
was more than capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 7.7 percentage 
points (p.p) to 79.5% last month. 
Upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to the rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In March, domestic 
traffic and capacity improved 106.4% and 86.1%, respectively. On the domestic front, 119.3% more passengers 
boarded GOL's flights in March 2022. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major 
airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Spirit Airlines, traded in the red over the past week. The 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index decreased 3.73% to $77.52. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index declined 19.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keep an eye on the first-quarter 2022 
earnings report of Delta, scheduled to be released on Apr 13.

Apr 04, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Betterment of air-travel demand led Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] to give an improved outlook for fiscal 2022 (ended 
Mar 31). Detailed results will be out on May 16. 
Owing to expanded passenger volumes, the European carrier, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects a 
loss in fiscal 2022 in the €350-€400 million range. The earlier outlook was of a loss in the €250-€450 million band. 
The forecast of a narrower loss comes on the back of an uptick in air traffic at Ryanair for the month of March, 
which exceeded the pre-pandemic levels. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2]. 
Evidently, in March 2022, RYAAY transported 11.2 million passengers, above the 0.5 million carried in March 2021, 
5.5 million in March 2020 and 10.9 million in the pre-pandemic era of March 2019. 
Due to increased traffic, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) rose to 87% in the month compared with 77% 
year ago. In February 2022, RYAAY attracted a traffic of 8.7 million passengers. The buoyant traffic data ahead of 
the Easter holidays certainly bodes well. The presence of these holidays this month is likely to boost traffic further. 
The improvement in air-travel demand despite headwinds like the Russia-Ukraine crisis is evident from the fact that 
air traffic at Ryanair exceeded 97 million in fiscal 2022, way above 27.5 million recorded in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 
2022 figure is, however, below the pre-pandemic peak level of 149 million. 
Some better-ranked stocks within the broaderTransportation[3]sector are as follows: 
USA TruckUSAK[4] currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. USAK's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
in three of the preceding four quarters (in line in one), the average surprise being 64.4%. 
Shares of USA Truck have increased 12% in the past six months. Improving freight conditions are aiding USAK. 
GATX CorporationGATX[5] currently flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1. GATX has an impressive surprise history, with its 
earnings having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average 
being 27.7%. 
Shares of GATX have also appreciated more than 32% in the past six months. Efforts to reward its shareholders 
through dividends and buybacks are very encouraging.

 Shares ofRyanair HoldingsRYAAY[1] have been displaying a downtrend on the bourses for a while now, declining 
24.3% in a year's time, better than itsindustry[2]'s 28.6% fall. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Let's delve into the reasons for this unimpressive price performance and examine if the stock's fortunes will rise 
going forward. 
Despite improvement, air-travel demand in the European Union continues to be below the pre-pandemic levels. The 
carrier's February traffic of 8.7 million, though well above the year-ago levels, was below the comparable figure of 
2019. The spike in coronavirus cases in Europe due to the omicron variant contributed to this weakness. 
Per Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, net loss at RYAAY for fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31) is likely to be in the middle of 
the forecast range of €250-€450 million[3]. Moreover, RYAAY's operating expenses are escalating, primarily due to 
increase in fuel and oil costs, and airport and handling charges. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, the carrier's 
operating expenses surged 87% year over year to €3,792 million. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[4]. 
With oil prices surging, operating expenses will continue to be steep. This is likely to dent bottom-line growth at 
RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, on a brighter note, O'Leary believes, RYAAY's 
performance might be better in fiscal 2023. This, however, depends on the pickup in air traffic and air fares. The 
CEO believes that pre-pandemic profits of 1.5 billion euros might be achieved in fiscal 2023. He was quoted saying: 
"There's a chance but it all depends on pricing'. 
However, following the resurgence of new coronavirus cases recently in some parts of the world, investors will now 
wait and see if this spreads to Europe and hurts Ryanair's improving traffic scenario. Disruptions due to the Russia-
Ukraine war may also affect the air-traffic pickup. 
Some better-ranked stocks within the broaderTransportation[5]sector are as follows: 
USA TruckUSAK[6] currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). USAK's earnings surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (in line in one), the average surprise being 64.4%. 
Shares of USA Truck have rallied more than 35% in the past six months. Improving freight conditions are aiding 
USAK. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Stock Down 24.3% in a Year's Time: Here's Why
GATX CorporationGATX[7] currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GATX has an impressive surprise history, with 
its earnings having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average 
being 27.7%. 
Shares of GATX have also appreciated more than 33% in the past six months. Efforts to reward its shareholders 
through dividends and buybacks are very encouraging.

Airlines 4 Europe: liberalization can optimize air traffic management

Mar 31, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 If the countries in the European Unie are unable to implement efficiency improvements in air traffic management 
with the Single European Sky (SES) program, then the alternative should be that air traffic management is 
liberalized. It's then up to competition between air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to improve the situation. 
This was one of the main topics at the Airlines 4 Europe[1] (A4E) Aviation Summit in Brussels on March 31. Airlines 
4 Europe: liberalization can optimize air traffic management. 
It was with some hesitation and embarrassment that Managing Director Thomas Reynaert raised the subject of the 
Single European Sky again. Making better use of air traffic management can optimize routes and reduce carbon 
emissions by at least ten percent, all stakeholders in the project agree. But SES has been on the table since its 
invention in 1999 and 23 years later is still waiting to be introduced, although experiments under the SESAR 
program are currently being tested. 
A4E hasraised the subject[2] at each of its Aviation Summits since the lobby group was formed in 2017. Reynaert 
and airline bosses like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, Lufthansa's Carsten Spohr, easyjet's Johan Lundgren, and IAG's 
Luis Gallego had to confess that the lobby hasn't been successful. O'Leary, who has voiced their opinion and 
frustrations on behalf of A4E before, blamed the lack of progress on individual countries. 'Which ones?', moderator 
Richard Quest wanted to know at a later panel session. 'France, Germany, but others too', the Irish airline boss 
replied. He thinks that ATM improvements and the use of new-technology aircraft can reduce emissions by even 32 
percent, as Ryanair outlines in its recent sustainability roadmap until 2050. 
Even Transport Commissioner is amazed by the lack of progress 
Interestingly, even European Transport Commissioner, Adina Valea, confessed she is surprised by the lack of 
progress made with SES. 'When I entered office, SES was the first file I concentrated on and put forward because it 
makes so much sense. Indeed, I am still amazed that the transport ministers of the EU countries don't recognize 
that.' She too blamed individual countries for the situation.  
Carsten Spohr criticized politicians for failing to act: 'Those who ask us to do more (about the environment) are the 
same who fail to do anything to get us those ten percent in emission savings.' The result is that the aviation industry 
is consistently being criticized for being the biggest polluter. O'Leary thinks the industry hasn't robustly enough 
communicated what it is doing, like investing billions in fleet renewal or pushing for more sustainable aviation fuels 
Airlines 4 Europe: liberalization can optimize air traffic management
(SAF). He also blames France, which as the current president of the European Council hasn't done anything to 
move forward with the Single European Sky.  
With no immediate solution in sight, A4E thinks a different approach is needed: 'For twenty years we have made no 
progress whatsoever on the Single European Sky. Our passengers, our business, our people are entitled to expect 
efficient airspace. Ninety percent of the delays in the past twelve months were caused by air traffic control', said 
O'Leary. 'We cannot, with record-high fuel prices, continue to waste fuel as a result from this fragmented ATM. We 
need Single European Sky and we need European governments to deliver.' 'If we can't have the SES, then let's 
liberalize air traffic management. Let's allow national ATC providers to compete against each other to provide more 
efficient services at lower prices,' O'Leary said. 
Reynaert blames the lack of progress on the very strong positions that unions have in some countries. 'If you want 
to digitalize, which is crucial in this sector, you are instantly meeting opposition. People are afraid to change. It's a 
lack of political willingness.' He thinks that changing the system to a cross-border ATC will result in more 
efficiencies.' Eurocontrol could have a role in this. 
Protection against strikes 
A4E also calls for the protection against national ATC strikes. Too often, controllers in notably France and Italy are 
calling out strikes that hurt international overflights. 'The French, cleverly, use national legislation to protect 
domestic flights but it are all the overflights that take the cancelations and delays. If we have a truly single market, 
Europe can and must these overflights', O'Leary said on behalf of A4E. 'When the French want to go on strike, let 
the French bear the consequences. But we shouldn't delay flights from Italy to Ireland or from Scandinavia to Spain 
simply because the French are on strike.' 
Like IATA before, A4E also opposed the initiative by ANSPs to pass the €5.4 billion bill for missed revenues in 2020 
and 2021 due to fewer flights during the pandemic on to airlines, who pass it on to their passengers. 'We shouldn't 
be obliged to pay for services that we didn't use', said Michael O'Leary. As government-owned organizations, the 
service providers should refer to their states for bailouts and financial aid. IATA Director General Willie Walsh said 
last year that ANSPs should either be helped by government-backed loans or seek commercial loans on the 
market. 
An interview with Thomas Reynaert on thefailed lobby[3] for the Single European Sky and the proposal for 
liberalization will follow later.

Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Increased Q1 Fuel Cost View, DAL 's Deal With Gevo

With Gevo

 In the past week, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] increased its fuel cost per gallon view for first-quarter 2022 
due to the recent upsurge in oil price. By doing so, ALGT joined a host of other airlines that took similar actions, as 
reported in the previous week's write up[2]. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[3] was another primary news maker in the past week, courtesy of its environmentally-friendly 
deal with the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) maker Gevo. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] was also in news for its eco-
friendly stance as it aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. RYAAY intends to achieve one-third of its 
decarbonization target through the use of sustainable jet fuels. An expansion-related update has also been 
available from Spirit Airlines SAVE[5] in the past week. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. Delta signed a 'take-or-
pay' agreement with Gevo for 75 million gallons of SAF per year for a seven-year term. The agreement replaces 
Delta's existing deal with Gevo, signed in 2019, to purchase 10 million gallons of SAF per year. It advances DAL's 
goal of achieving net-zero aviation. DAL has a target to replace 10% of its conventional jet fuel consumption with 
SAF by the end of 2030.  
2. In line with its objective to use more SAF, Ryanair is trying to accelerate the supply of SAF by working with the 
European Union and fuel suppliers. RYAAY anticipates 32% of the decarbonization to happen via technological and 
operational improvements. RYAAY intends to continue investing in new technology and aircraft. 
Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects to reduce emissions by offsetting measures. Carbon-
capture offset projects plus government policies and reforms, such as the introduction of the Single European Sky 
ATM Research (SESAR), are expected to help RYAAY meet 24% of its decarbonation target[6]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
3. Allegiant now expects fuel price per gallon to be $3.05 in the first quarter of 2022 (earlier guidance was $2.67). 
Allegiant lowered its capacity growth forecast for the first quarter due to the oil price rise. Available seat miles (a 
measure of capacity), both for scheduled service and system wide, are expected to increase in the 17-19% range 
from the first-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance was for an increase in the 19-23% range). 
Due to the cut in the capacity growth forecast, ALGT increased the lower limit of its first-quarter 2022 non-fuel unit 
cost growth projection. The metric is now expected to rise in the 3-5% range from the first-quarter 2019 actuals[8] 
(earlier guidance was an increase of 1-5%).

4. In response to the uptick in air-travel demand, Spirit Airlines is widening its network. To this end, SAVE is 
expanding its presence in Las Vegas, NV, with nonstop flights to Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ), Boise 
Airport (BOI) and Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO). Daily nonstop service between Harry Reid International 
Airport in Las Vegas and ABQ is set to begin Aug 3, 2022, onward. The same between Las Vegas and BOI is 
expected to commence Aug 5 onward. The service between Las Vegas and RNO will be operational twice daily 
from Aug 10. Following these new services, Spirit Airlines will operate flights to 41 nonstop destinations and offer up 
to 75 peak-day departures. This indicates a 30% increase in SAVE's service to Las Vegas[9] from the year-ago 
reported figure. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the 
past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week. However, the gains 
were muted in nature. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 1.3% to $75.86. Over the past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 23%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Watch this space for the usual

 After a clean sweep of 6 election referendums in 5 states, pot is now legal in 36 states plus D.C. Federal 
legalization is expected soon and that could kick start an even greater bonanza for investors. Zacks Investment

 As the outrage over the P&O scandal reaches the point of inertia, here's my (slightly disheartening) take: We all 
saw the disturbing news of P&O Ferries sacking 800 people with no notice last week and the justifiable outrage it 
caused.We have seen protests from unions on the docks, captains refusing to leave their ships or let new crews (of 
underpaid foreign agency workers) onboard against a backdrop of unified condemnation from media, social 
mediaand across the political spectrum. But will this abhorrent treatment of workers impact P&O Ferries' brand and 
profit?
 Sadly,I suspect not. Time and again we see big businesses bully workers and customers and get away with it. This 
is particularly true where a brand dominates a certain market; condemnation alone is not enough. Are consumers 
likely to wait for the next ferry rather than take a P&O one?Will freight companies endanger their already over-
pressured supply lines?I suspect the answer to both these questions is 'no'. The government seemsreluctant 
toclose these loopholes ('fire and rehire' is one of many) which begs the question; can consumers, media or 
campaigners have a real influence on brand behaviour? We've witnessed Wetherspoons' mass sackings,Amazon's 
mass-exploitation of workers,RyanAir's decades of customer service horror stories, Google slyly but - perhaps- 
fittinglydisavow its promise not to be evil, and Brewdog allegedly mistreat its own staff, undercut its supporters, and 
mislead the public,among a series of misdemeanours. Even Facebook, perhaps the most scandal-riven of Big 
Tech's oligopoly, could ride out its bad PR with a simple rebrand. History is littered with examples,but even in the 
age of 'cancel culture' a PR scandal does not lastingly and damagingly impact brands that dominate their respective 
markets. We are all complicit. A company does something dreadful and we say'I will never give XXXXX my 
business again' but within weeks or months, sometimes days - whether through necessity or convenience- we're 
drawn back. And brands know this: in factthey rely on it. We joke that P&O's PR department were first to go,but 
more accurately they probably took the view that, as long as their ferries are running, people have too few other 
options stop to using them. So, in pursuit of cost cuts and long-term financial salvation, they deemed the short-term 
outrage worth the bad PR. And soit will prove. In the corporate world, just as in the political, rhetoric and righteous 
outrage isn't enough to make dominant brands behave. If things are ever going to change, then activism need to be 
channelled into a very clear purpose, whether that's pressure on governments to change the law, intervene, or 
suffer at the ballot box.

Ryanair targets use of one-third of SAF by 2050
Ryanair targets use of one-third of SAF by 2050

Mar 21, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Increasing its uptake of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) to slightly over one-third (34 percent) is one of the means 
how Irish low-cost carrierRyanair[1] wants to become carbon neutral by 2050. The use of more SAF is part of its 
'Pathway to Net Zero' that was presented on March 21. Ryanair targets use of one-third of SAF by 2050. 
Ryanair is claiming to be one of the greenest airlines, with pre-Covid carbon dioxide emissions of 66 grams per 
passenger and per kilometer. That's fifty percent less than many European flag carriers, Ryanair said in its 2021 
annual report. It reached this number thanks to a modern 'green' fleet, voluntary offsetting programs for customers 
since April 2020, and smarter operations. 
The latest plan builds on the earlier strategy and is outlined in the 2021 sustainability report[2]. Ryanair said earlier 
that it wanted to increase the use of SAFs to 12.5 percent in 2030 but now intends to make another jump to 34 
percent by 2050. With SAF still very much in short supply in Europe (and elsewhere), Ryanair calls on the 
European Union and suppliers to stimulate the production. It will use its partnership with Trinity College in Dublin to 
further determine the sustainability of SAF and accelerate the certification of new blends. Ryanair welcomes the 
RefuelEU initiative of the European Commission's Fit for 55 packages to mandate the use of five percent SAF by 
2030, although it says it is well below its own initiative. 
MAX 8200 and more efficient operations should save another 32 percent in emissions 
Another third (32 percent) of its net-zero plan must come from technological and operational improvements. The 
technological jump must come by introducing more fuel-efficient Boeing MAX 8200[3] into the fleet, of which it now 
has 55 with another 155 on order. They reduce fuel burn per seat by sixteen percent and operate at forty percent 
lower noise levels. Combined with the use of SAF, the MAX 8200 should help reduces CO2 emissions from the 
current 66 grams per passenger/km to sixty grams in 2030. 
On the operational side, Ryanair sees improvements thanks to using more optimized flight plans that save fuel, the 
use of auxiliary power units and single-engine ground taxi operations wherever possible, plus more continuous 
descent approaches into airports. This is also part of Ryanair's quest to improve air traffic management with the 
Single European Sky SESAR program, which has been tested since last year and should bring ten percent fuel 
savings. Together withAirlines 4 Europe[4] and in his previous role as its chairman, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary 
has been pushing for the swift introduction of SES for years. Under the current European Commission, there finally 
seems to be some movement on the subject. 
Ryanair targets use of one-third of SAF by 2050
The final quarter (24 percent) of Ryanair's carbon zero targets in 2050 must come from offsetting and other 
economic measures. The airline sees options for carbon capture offsetting programs as well as other offsetting 
schemes, but opposes additional kerosene taxes that have been proposed by theFit for 55[5] plan for intra-
European flights. The carriers said that in 2020, it already paid €630 million inenvironmental taxes[6] but delivered 
no benefits as the proceeds hardly ever are applied to sustainability initiatives for aviation. The EU-tax scheme will 
do nothing for the 'highest polluters', which are the long-haul, intercontinental flights. 
Offsetting schemes should be refined 
Ryanair is more in favor of improving the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the worldwide CORSIA 
offsetting scheme, which should help reduce emissions in 2035 by some 2.5 billion tonnes. The airline calls on 
refining existing carbon-pricing mechanisms before creating new ones. It also wants to 'earmark any revenue raised 
from auctioning emission allowances to finance the high-tech transition towards lower-emitting aircraft that carry a 
higher load factor.' This would fit its own fleet of high-capacity MAX 8200s. 
Part of the offsetting plan also is offering the option to passengers. Ryanair launched its Carbon Calculator in July 
2021, offering passengers a choice to partially offset their flight for €2 of in full for €4.20. The scheme has been 
used by three percent of its customers, raising €3.5 million, but Ryanair wants to grow this. In all, the Irish carrier 
hopes to achieve the A-climate protection score next year from CDP, up from the already high current B-score.

Bott urges solicitors to put all defendants on notice of equitable lien

 Bott: Fantastic day for access to justice 
Litigators should now put defendants on notice at the start of any matter that they will enforce an equitable lien if 
necessary, the senior partner of Bott & Co has advised. 
David Bott also described Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling was a 'fantastic day' for access to justice and meant 
solicitors could innovate and process claims using technology as his firm had done. 
'The court accepted the fact that the law isn't people with quills anymore,' he said. 
The Supreme Court ruled by majority[1] that Bott & Co did have a lien over compensation that Ryanair paid directly 
to its flight delay clients, even if the claims were uncontested. 
The defendant needs to be on notice if a solicitor wants to enforce an equitable lien and Bott & Co now does so 
from the start, Mr Bott said. 
All claimant solicitors should do the same, he said. 'It's like insurance - most of the time you won't need it, but it's 
there if you do.' 
The next step in the case will be for Bott & Co to seek an order requiring the airline to list every client it had paid - 
while some told the law firm, not all did. And of those that did, 30% did not then hand over the 95 fee from the 
compensation that they owed the firm. 
Coby Benson, the solicitor who leads the flight delay compensation team at Bott & Co, said there had been a 
widespread misunderstanding that such claims were simple and uncontested - in fact, the firm has had to issue 
proceedings in 45% of the 226,000 successful claims it has brought since 2013. 
The business model worked on the swings and roundabouts of volume. 'The advantage of our service is that client 
commits to paying the same 95 fee and that's regardless of how far the case goes,' he said. 
He explained that this misunderstanding came from the inclusion in the defendant's trial bundle of a screenshot of 
the Bott & Co website that claimed a 99% success rate. 
This actually related to personal injury work that went to trial but was not commented on by the High Court. 
However, it was picked up by the Court of Appeal, by which time Bott & Co could not adduce any new evidence on 
the point, and 'nearly led to the demise of our case', Mr Benson said. 
However, Lord Briggs in the Supreme Court commended the firm's service for dealing with 'impediments to access 
to justice'. 
Bott urges solicitors to put all defendants on notice of equitable lien
Mr Bott said the policy underlying the decision recognised the growth in types of litigation where compensation was 
awarded on a fixed or tariff basis and through systems that discouraged litigation, like the new whiplash portal - and 
against the background of a push for more alternative dispute resolution to reduce pressure on the courts. 
'If the lien only existed in certain circumstances, the expansion of these regimes would be thwarted,' he said. 'It is a 
very pragmatic, modern judgment.' 
'You don't need proceedings, you don't need a dispute but you need a significant contribution' - a bar the Supreme 
Court said was low. 
Mr Bott added: 'It is reassuring that the courts acknowledge that access to justice is well served by our activities 
and that airlines - or any potential defendant - should not interfere in matters where the claimant has chosen legal 
representation. 
'As far as access to justice is concerned, it's a fantastic day.' 
In its statement, Ryanair said it welcomed the Supreme Court's 'recognition that solicitors should advise passengers 
to claim directly using Ryanair's simple online claims procedure without incurring legal fees'. 
It went on: 'These Supreme Court findings compliment the Court of Appeal's 2019 final ruling regarding Ryanair's 
online claims procedure which upheld Ryanair's policy of requiring consumers to use that straightforward procedure 
before engaging third parties 
'Ryanair urges customers with valid EU261 compensation claims to submit their claims directly to Ryanair and 
avoid 'claims chaser' firms such as Bott & Co, Fairplane, Hayward Baker, Sky Legal and Flightright, who can deduct 
over 40% of a 220 claim in fees.' 
It said a claims team 'processes all valid claims within an industry-leading period of 10 working days'.

 Supreme Court: 3:2 majority 
A law firm handling uncontested flight delay claims did have an equitable lien over the compensation, the Supreme 
Court has ruled, overturning the Court of Appeal. 
Lord Burrows said a solicitor could claim an equitable lien when they provided services in relation to making a 
client's claim - with or without legal proceedings - 'which significantly contribute to the successful recovery of a fund 
by the client'. 
Bott & Co Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2022] UKSC 8[1] concerned the airline dealing directly with the Cheshire 
law firm's flight delay clients, including paying them compensation. 
The Court of Appeal ruled in 2019 that the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, 
and so did not have an equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees 
due to Bott. 
The Supreme Court overturned this by a majority of three to two, with the majority - Lords Burrows and Briggs and 
Lady Arden - each reaching the same conclusion by different jurisprudential routes. Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose 
gave a joint dissenting judgment. 
Lord Briggs described the issue which divided the court as 'whether it matters that there is an 'actual or reasonably 
anticipated dispute' about the claim, at the time when the solicitors agree to act'. 
He said: 'For Lady Arden and Lord Burrows what matters is that the solicitors agree to act in furtherance of a claim. 
They point out that neither the client nor (a fortiori) the solicitors may know whether the claim will be disputed when 
the solicitors are asked to act 
'For Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose, the automatic conferral of the lien whenever solicitors are pursuing a claim fails 
adequately to reflect the animating principle, that it should serve access to justice. 
'If all that a solicitor does is write a letter on behalf of a client asking for payment of a sum of money about which 
there can be no reasonable possibility of a dispute, or likelihood of refusal to pay once demanded, then that activity 
is unconnected with access to justice.' 
The Supreme Court reviewed its 2018 decision in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co, which 
Lord Burrows said was 'best interpreted as supporting a clear, principled and easy-to-apply test' on the equitable 
lien 'that does not turn on whether there was a dispute'. 
Supreme Court upholds solicitors' lien in 'uncontested' cases
This case could not be distinguished from Gavin Edmondson, he went on. The test for a solicitor's equitable lien 
was 'whether a solicitor provides services (within the scope of the retainer with its client) in relation to the making of 
a client's claim (with or without legal proceedings) which significantly contribute to the successful recovery of a fund 
by the client'. 
He explained: 'That seems to me to be the best interpretation of what Gavin Edmondson laid down. It is a clear and 
simple test to apply. Solicitors (and potential defendants) will know exactly where they stand.' 
This approach promoted access to justice: 'The vindication of a client's legal rights, through the making of claims, is 
more likely to be effective if solicitors know that they have the security of a lien to recover their costs.' 
A year after Bott & Co launched its largely automated flight compensation system in 2013, Ryanair developed its 
own system for its customers to use. 
The question, Lord Burrows said, was whether Bott's service then provided 'no added value to what a reasonably 
competent customer of Ryanair can sort out for himself or herself without incurring any legal costs'. 
He decided: 'However, if one looks at this question in the context of Bott's services generally in relation to flight 
compensation claims, it can fairly be said that Bott has made a significant contribution to the recovery of 
compensation by its clients.' 
This linked to the question of whether it was acceptable for solicitors to charge fees where a person could very 
easily make a claim and recover compensation without incurring any legal fees. 
Lord Burrows said: 'Clearly it is important that people are not misled by solicitors and, in certain situations, it may be 
strongly argued that any reputable solicitor would first advise a prospective client that he or she should utilise an 
online claims procedure without incurring any legal costs. 
'In so far as it is thought that a system of online compensation is being abused by solicitors to charge unnecessary 
fees, this would be a matter for the Solicitors' Regulation Authority to investigate. 
'In relation to an equitable lien, there is a well-established equitable doctrine that could be invoked to prevent any 
abuse, namely that the solicitor asserting the lien would need 'to come to equity with clean hands'.' 
Lady Arden said the equitable lien needed to be extended to cover costs incurred in the wider range of processes 
now available to resolve complaints and claims. 
'Accordingly, it seems to me that the equitable lien can and should be held to arise where there is no dispute as 
such, but the client has a claim which has not been admitted and which must be formulated and communicated to 
the service provider or other prospective defendant in order to elicit whether there is a dispute.' 
The justice observed that trying to keep a client out of court was 'an important aspect of the role of the solicitor 
these days in contentious matters'. 
She agreed with Lord Burrows that the solicitors' services must have significantly contributed to the recovery of 
money or property: 'The paying party is protected by the rule that he will not have to pay twice if he did not have the 
requisite notice and did not collude with the client.' 
Lady Arden added: 'I have borne in mind the concern that solicitors should not be in a privileged position as regards 
other professionals providing legal services, but on the information available at this time I take the view that that is 
probably a matter for Parliament perhaps when reviewing the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974 in relation to 
costs.' 
Lord Briggs, who gave the lead judgment in Gavin Edmondson, admitted that he had changed his mind about the 
present case 'more than once'. 
But he noted that any methods by which solicitors could reduce the disproportionate cost of taking action to pursue 
a small claim 'are in principle likely to serve the cause of access to justice', while 'the need for reasonable certainty 
as to the existence of the lien' was important. 
'I recognise that the simple test proposed by Lady Arden and Lord Burrows may occasionally involve the 
recognition of the equitable lien in wider circumstances than is strictly justified by its animating access to justice 
principle. 
'It may also confer upon solicitors a proprietary security for payment for services with no very sophisticated legal 
content which other providers of the same services do not enjoy, simply because they are not solicitors. The facts of 
this case illustrate both those concerns 
'But it by no means follows that a lien which in most cases will continue to promote access to justice should now be 
withdrawn or restricted in its scope merely because there are others who do the same in competition with solicitors. 
'An obvious alternative might be to extend the lien to them as well. But that is not a matter capable of being 
addressed in this case. It would in all probability best be left to legislation.' 
Supreme Court upholds solicitors' lien in 'uncontested' cases
The dissenting judgment argued that 'for a lien to arise, there must be a dispute, existing or reasonably anticipated, 
in connection with which the services of the solicitor are sought' - which was not the case in the vast majority of 
claims handled by Bott. 
But the majority warned that this would place solicitors in a very difficult position. Lord Burrows said: 'The solicitor 
needs to know in advance of providing particular services (or developing a business model) whether or not it will be 
entitled to an equitable lien if there is a successful outcome. The solicitor cannot know whether claims will or will not 
be disputed by the other side.'

Mar 16, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 We have recently updated a report on Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1]. 
Ryanair has an impressive Growth Score[2] of B. This style score condenses all the essential metrics from the 
company's financial statements to get a true sense of quality and sustainability of growth. 
Improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. The carrier's January traffic surged 
more than 400% year over year. Ryanair's traffic in February 2022 increased more than 100% year over year to 8.7 
million. Traffic has been consistently improving on a year-over-year basis in the past several months. The carrier 
raised its five-year traffic growth forecast to 50% from 33% expected earlier. Ryanair now expects traffic to grow to 
more than 225 million guests per year by March 2026 compared with the 200 million predicted earlier. 
Ryanair's liquidity position is encouraging. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company's cash and 
cash equivalents stood at $3,924 million, higher than the current debt of $434 million. This indicates that the 
company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. 
With ramp up in operations, Ryanair's operating expenses are escalating primarily due to an increase in fuel and oil 
costs and airport and handling charges. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, the carrier's operating expenses 
surged 87% year over year to €3,792 million. High operating costs have the potential to hurt the carrier's bottom 
line. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [3]sector are Expeditors International of 
Washington, Inc. EXPD[4], Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ODFL[5] and Triton International Limited TRTN[6] 
Expeditors has an earnings surprise of 34.2%, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past 
four quarters. Expeditors is being aided by the uptick in airfreight revenues. We are optimistic about the company's 
buyout of Fleet Logistics' Digital Platform. The acquisition has boosted Expeditors' online LTL shipping platform, 
Koho. The move is in line with the company's focus on Digital Solutions. 
EXPD currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
stocks here.[7] 
The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Old Dominion is pegged at 16%. Old Dominion is 
benefiting from strong performance in the LTL segment, owing to improved freight conditions. In 2021, revenues 
from the LTL services segment increased 30.7% on a year-over-year basis. 
Solid Liquidity Boosts Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Amid High Expenses
Driven by the tailwinds, the stock has increased 35% in the past year. ODFL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy). 
The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Triton is pegged at 10%. Gradual increases in 
trade volumes and container demand bode well for the company. With easing coronavirus-led restrictions in the 
United States and Europe, the company saw a strong rebound in its business in the third, the fourth of 2020 as well

 [Mateusz Piątkowski is an Assistant Professor at the University of Łódź, Poland (Faculty of Law and Administration, 
International Law Department), Attorney-at-law, and Member of the Polish Society of the Military Law and the Law 
of War. The author thanks Dr Tomasz Lachowski from University of Łódź, Poland and LtnCol. Dr Wojciech Mendel 
from the Polish Society of Military Law and the Law of War for their valuable commentaries.] 
In August 2020, major civil unrest erupted in Belarus in response to the rigged presidential election. Despite the 
mass protest, president Alyaksandr Lukashenko holds effective control of the state[1], and in brutal crackdowns, 
suppresses the democratic opposition, forcing the projected winner of the 2020 election, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, 
to flee the country. Poland and Lithuania offered significant support for the oppressed Belarusians, granting them 
asylum (Tischanovskaya herself was granted asylum in Lithuania). Lukashenko's actions were condemned by the 
EU and NATO and new sanctions were imposed on the regime, as international isolation of Lukashenko 
progressed, with their only ally being the Russian Federation. 
In spring 2021 Lukashenko started to highlight in his public speeches that the actions of Lithuania, Poland and the 
EU, which in his opinion sponsored the coup d`etat in Belarus, had to be punished in a radical way. Known for his 
unchecked temperament, the dictator emphasized[2] that 'Poland will receive a huge blow'. The first warning was 
sent in May 2021, when the Polish-registered Ryanair FR4978 flying from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in 
Minsk in order to arrest the Belarusian journalist, Raman Pratasevich. The incidents also sparked a dispute[3] 
regarding the circumstances in which an aircraft flying over a state could be forced to land in order to exercise that 
state's criminal jurisdiction. As a response[4], the EU closed its airspace to Belarusian air carriers and EU state 
member state's aircraft were banned from flying over the airspace of Belarus. 
In early summer 2021, Belarus adopted significant changes in migration policies, such as a 'tourist visa' for 
nationals of the Middle East and African countries. Belarusian state-controlled tourist agencies offered affordable 
trips to Minsk or 'hunting escapades'. At the same time, Belarus expanded flights connecting to countries such as 
Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Dubai for no apparent reasons. Shortly after arriving in Minsk, migrants were provided with 
transportation to the border area with Lithuania. In place, Belarusian border guard agents served as 'point men'[5], 
providing details about the border, the best places to cross, and further instruction to avoid eventual control. On 17 
August 2021 Lithuania reported that Belarusian border guards crossed the border[6]. In 2020, the number of illegal 
Polish - Lithuanian - Belarusian Border Crisis and Ius ad Bellum Part I: Background and Key Findings
entries from Belarus into Lithuania was 74, while in the first eight months of 2021 Lithuania identified 3 836 
arrivals[7]. In October 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that it processed approximately 1289 
international protection applications with only two applicants receiving refugee status[8].  
Simultaneously in August 2021, the number of intercepted crossings skyrocketed at the Polish-Belarusian border. 
From 1 January 2021 to 11 November 2021, Poland reported 33 000 illegal crossings[9]. Poland responded by 
declaring a state of emergency at the frontier zone, the construction of barbed wire, and the redeployment of law 
enforcement and military forces. The most intense incident was reported on 8 November 2021, when a column of 
approximately 4 000 migrants marched to the Bruzhi-Kunica border crossing. The Belarusian military and police 
provided cutting tools, wooden logs, and stones[10]. Belarusian soldiers and border guards created a cordon 
around temporary camps of immigrants, firing in the air from time to time to force the migrants to cross the border. 
People gathered near the border of Belarus were not allowed to return to Belarus and there were reports of abuse if 
they tried to do so[11].  
By analyzing the above-mentioned facts, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1. The migrant crisis on the border between Lithauania-Belarus and Poland-Belarus is artificially created and fully 
orchestrated by the Lukaschenko regime, which conceals international migrant smuggling under the false pretext of 
'tourist activities'. The actions of Belarus could be classified as 'coercive engineered migrations'[12]. 
2. International law rigorously combats human trafficking. In 2000, alongside the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children[13]. The Protocol establishes an overall duty on 
the state parties to prevent trafficking (Art. 9). Under the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, 
and Air[14], supplementing the above-mentioned UN Convention, the state of Belarus must effectively prevent the 
smuggling of migrants (art. 2), including by criminalization of smuggling (art. 6), cooperation between states with 
common borders (art. 10) and other border measures (art. 11). Belarus has been a party to these treaties since 
2003. However, the Protocols are silent in regard to state-sponsored activities. The main 'purpose and objective' of 
these treaties is 'to prevent and combat' smuggling or trafficking. In order to achieve this goal, states must 
criminalize human trafficking or smuggling by correspondingly amending the state's national law. By default, the 
Protocols link the offences to individuals, not states per se. To put it simply, the Protocols do not directly address 
the activities of the state, which by actions conducted by its agents is involved in human trafficking or smuggling. 
Nevertheless, the obligations towards other states, especially to those which have a common border, might be 
deduced by invoking the provisions which are creating preventive duties, such as the commitment to exchange 
information (art. 10 of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air). Both Protocols contain 
a provision regarding the settlement of disputes, establishing a procedure with ultimately could trigger the 
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Poland and Belarus did not submit reservations to this provision. 
3. There are two goals of the operation[15]. The first one is retaliation: individually against Poland and Lithuania, 
collectively against the EU and NATO. The second is political: to force the West to recognize Lukashenko as the 
lawful ruler of Belarus and to end the sanctions imposed after the unrest in August 2020. Furthermore, on the 
suggestion of Sergei Lavror, the Russian Federation Foreign Minister, the EU 'could provide financial 
assistance[16]' to Belarus to stop illegal immigration, just as Turkey is receiving financial support under the 
agreement with the EU. 
4. On the ground, the operation is being directed by Belarusian secret services, border guards, soldiers, and 
policeman[17]. The agents of the Belarusian state provide the migrants with the tools for forced entry, 
transportation, instructions on how and when cross the border, intelligence and smuggling technics[18]. They also 
pressured the migrants to make an attempt to cross and denied them the possibility of returning. In November 
2021, there was also news regarding direct shipment of migrants between the Polish and Lithuanian borders[19], 
organized by the Belarusian military. 
5. On some occasions, there is the probability that Belarusian agents have crossed the international border. During 
the night between 1 and 2 November 2021, armed masked persons were spotted on the Polish side of the border. 
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested[20] against this intrusion. Also, as revealed in the news, there are 
reports stating that the Belarusian border guard special forces (OSAM) had infiltrated[21] the Polish territory as far 
back as 2020.  
6. Recently, it has been reported that Belarusian border guards directly demolished a section of the barbed wire 
fence (already installed in the Polish territory) and Polish troops were blinded by laser and stroboscope lights[22].

Mar 15, 2022( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 By Mauldin Economics. Originally published at ValueWalk[1]. 
Are you scared? 
If so, you're not alone. Many investors are freaking out right now. 
The S&P 500 recently dropped to its lowest levels since September 2020. Many tech stocks have been cut in half 
over the past few months. 
I regularly chat with dozens of investors. From conversations I've had in the past week, I sense folks haven't been 
this worried since the onset of COVID-19[2]. 
  
  
Q4 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] 
But while much of the world panics, I see an opportunity to buy a specific group of stocks—a group that's still hated 
after last year's 'fakeout' 
I'll tell you all about it in a moment. First, let's rewind the clock 
Think back to the last time folks were this panicked 
Two years ago, COVID shut the world down. 
The pandemic decimated many industries. Among the worst-hit were travel[4] and tourism. 
Prior to COVID, roughly 2.5 million travelers passed through TSA checkpoints on any given day. That plunged 95% 
to 90,000 in April 2020. 
The Reopening Trade 
Remember the 'reopening trade' hype last summer? 
Last summer, the world wassupposedto reopen. With the arrival of vaccines[5], COVID was expected to go away 
quickly. 
We all know how that played out. 
The vaccine rollout in most countries took longer than expected. And new variants of COVID emerged—Delta and 
Omnicron—forcing people indoors once again. 
Canada didn't open its borders until last fall. America was closed to international travelers until November. 
Is It Time To Buy Travel Stocks?
You needed a vaccine passport to fly overseas yet most people didn't get their shots immediately. 
Even during the height of summer, tourist numbers only reached two-thirds of pre-COVID levels. 
Now, things are finally starting to turn around 
According to theNew York Times, more than 4.99 billion people have gotten at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. 
That's 65.1% of the world's population. 
And all across America, mask mandates are being lifted for vaccinated people. 
The world is truly opening up this time. 
Australia and New Zealand opened their borders last month. 
Ireland, where I live, just scrapped mask mandates[6]. Vaccine passports are a thing of the past in several 
European countries. 
Flown in the past few weeks? If so, you likely noticed airports are packed. TSA data shows passenger numbers are 
now 90%+ of pre-COVID levels. 
The number of Americans flying overseas jumped 130% compared to last year. 
Europe's largest airline, Ryanair, said it expects passenger numbers this summer to be 15% higher than 2019. 
On its latest earnings call, online travel agent Expedia forecasted something bolder:'Summer 2022 will be the 
busiest travel season ever.' 
Home-sharing pioneer Airbnb[7] revealed the number of nights booked on its platform jumped 25% compared to 
2019, ride-hailing giant Uber saw airport pickups triple year-over-year, and American Express achieved record 
earnings of the back of'stronger consumer travel spending.' 
Opportunity In Travel Stocks 
I know a boom when I see one 
It's not only one or two travel-related businesses putting up great numbers. 
Airlines, travel agents, hotels[8], taxis, and credit card firms are all telling you the same thing: travel is back in a big 
way. 
And this is just a taste of what's to come. Tourism won't just hit its pre-COVID 2019 peak 
It will surge to new highs.I'm 100% sure of this. 
Think about what makes you truly happy. 
I doubt it's that new car smell or a crisp $5,000 suit. It's experiences, like vacations with your family. Those are the 
things you remember for a lifetime. 
Most folks have been deprived of this joy for two years. I know people who haven't vacationed since 2019! They 
can't wait to hop on a plane this summer. 
Folks are sitting on thousands of dollars' worth of travel vouchers, and they're determined to make up for lost time. 
Mark my words, we'll see the strongest demand ever for vacations this year. 
Okay, Stephen what does this mean for my money? 
As I mentioned, many investors are panicking right now. 
US stocks dropped 14% this year to their lowest levels since September 2020. And despite the coming tourist 
boom, travel-related companies have gotten rocked too. 
Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG)collapsed 30% in just 13 trading days. It's now trading at the same levels it did 
when borders were shut, and nobody had a vaccine. 
Ditto for theUS Airline ETF (NYMARKET:JETS). Airline stocks have plunged to levels last seen in the summer of 
2020. 
This is a great buying opportunity.[9] 
Travel-related stocks have been hit by fears over a slowing economy and rising inflation. The thinking goes if folks 
are short on cash, they'll cancel their vacations. 
This is the big risk to investing in travel-related stocks, but it's a risk worth taking. 
Firstly, the market has already 'priced in' these risks. Many travel-related stocks have plunged 20%-30% in the past 
two weeks. They didn't even fall this hard when COVID hit! 
The market has jumped ahead of itself. A recession, no matter how bad, won't hurt travel as bad as COVID. 
Also, many folks aren't prepared to miss out on a vacation three years running. People will do anything they can to 
get away this year. 
Some are sitting on thousands of dollars' worth of travel vouchers, so vacations are essentially already paid for. 
I'll leave you with a final tip 
Sometimes in markets,it pays to be brave and make big calls[10]. This is one of those times. 
Is It Time To Buy Travel Stocks?
We're on the cusp of a travel boom. Nearly every travel business is showing us this. Yet, many of these stocks[11] 
are trading like we're still in the middle of the pandemic. 
This is your opportunity to scoop up shares in quality travel-related companies for a big discount.

Bot calls out firms over gender pay gap
Bot calls out firms over gender pay gap

 British companies posting messages for International Women's Day are having their gender pay gaps exposed by 
a Twitter bot, leading some to delete their posts. 
Companies such as Ryanair, Barclays and outsourcer Capita, as well as universities and government departments, 
have been called out by the Gender Pay Gap Bot, which states in its Twitter biography: 'Employers, if you tweet 
about International Women's Day, I'll retweet your gender pay gap.' 
The cover photograph on the account reads: 'Deeds not words. Stop posting platitudes. Start fixing the problem.' 
When a firm posts a tweet that contains any International Women's Day hashtags, the bot automatically responds 
with its median gender pay gap, which is calculated using openly available data from the government. The worst 
offenders include Young's pubs and Ryanair, where women are paid a median of 73.2 and 68.6 per cent less than 
men, respectively. 
Other British organisations mentioned are travel group Tui UK, with a gap of 41.7 per cent; the government agency 
Innovate UK, with a pay gap of 36 per cent; Barclays Bank with 34.5 per cent; and Capita at 33.2 per cent. 
Some companies outed by the bot use messages of female empowerment in their marketing, including the fashion 
retailer Missguided, which pays women 40 per cent less than men. HM Revenue & Customs, the Department for 
Environment and the House of Lords - with pay gaps of 8.8, 6.8 and 5.1 per cent - were also exposed by the bot, 
whose data caused many organisations, such as Innovate UK, HMRC and Exeter University, to delete their initial 
posts — with many reposting later in the day. 
Innovate UK's now-deleted post also spotlighted '38 inspiring women and their ideas', yet featured a photo of its 
chief executive, Indro Mukerjee, who is a man. 
While many companies fell short of expectations, a handful did pay employees equally. Those leading the way 
include the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, St John's Ambulance and Registers of Scotland. 
The London Fire Brigade even pays women 2.7 per cent more than men. 
The account was created last year by social media manager Francesca Lawson and software developer Ali 
Fensome.

Mar 03, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, the ban imposed by the U.S. government on Russian carriers by closing down its airspace 
following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia dominated headlines. However, even before the announcement was 
made on Mar 1, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] and American Airlines AAL[2] had already suspended their partnerships with 
the respective Russian carriers. United Airlines UAL[3] too followed suit by temporarily suspending flights over the 
Russian airspace. 
In other news, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] reported impressive traffic numbers for February on the back of upbeat 
air-travel demand. Expansion-related updates were available from United Airlines and Spirit Airlines SAVE[5] in the 
previous week. 
Read the last Airline roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold),is set to resume San Francisco-Melbourne (Australia) flights on May 7. The service remained 
suspended for long due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. 
Throughout the pandemic, United Airlines had maintained its passenger service to Australia. UAL offers the 
maximum number of flights to Australia among all U.S. carriers, management had said earlier[7]. You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. Spirit Airlines launched a service from Orlando International Airport (MCO) to Mercedita International Airport 
(PSE) in Ponce. The move expands its presence in Puerto Rico. This daily nonstop service complements Spirit 
Airlines' existing operations in San Juan (SJU) and Aguadilla (BQN) in Puerto Rico. From Orlando, FL, SAVE 
operates around 80 flights each day, providing one-stop options between PSE and 28 cities across its route map[9]. 
3. Despite omicron-led woes, Ryanair's traffic in February 2022 surged more than 100% year over year to 8.7 
million. Traffic in February 2021 was only 0.5 million at RYAAY. Last month's traffic was also higher than the 
previous month's reading of 7 million, reflecting the gradual improvement in air-travel demand. Load factor 
(percentage of seats filled with passengers) in February 2021 was 86% higher than 78% recorded in February 2021 
and 79% in January 2022.  
4. Following the eruption of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Delta suspended its codeshare agreement with the Russian-
carrier Aeroflot. To severe ties with Russia, American Airlines suspended its agreements with Aeroflot and another 
Russian carrier S7 Airlines. United Airlines, which uses the Russian airspace for flights from Delhi (India) is

reportedly[10] evaluating options as to how it can continue operating such flights using different routes. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

The table above shows that almost airline stocks traded in the red over the past week mainly due to the upsurge in 
oil price. We note that even before the Russia-Ukraine crisis emanated, oil price was witnessing a spike. Russia's 
launch of military operations in Ukraine skyrocketed the commodity price further (currently trading above $100 a 
barrel). 
The upsurge is reflective of the concerns about oil supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest 
producers of the commodity. Such escalation in oil price does not bode well for airlines' bottom line as fuel 
expenses represent one of the largest input costs for these operators. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
decreased 6.2% to $78.49 over the past week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 15%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for further updates on the impact on airlines as 
the Russia-Ukraine tension increases.

Feb 21, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 With tensions between Russia and Ukraine, what might be the impact if a conflict should break out in the region? 
Looking at the largest western airline groups, the percentage of operations into Ukraine is relatively low, under one 
percent for each of the major airline groups with the exception of Wizz Air, which has roughly three percent of its 
flights into Ukraine.  
The direct results of a potential conflict are already being felt, as several carriers, including KLM, Lufthansa, 
SWISS, Austrian, Vueling, and Emirates have suspended flights to and from Ukraine, with additional suspensions of 
service likely. Other than Ukrainian operators, who are based in the country, the remaining carriers have little 
exposure. 
Given that direct impacts from schedules are not particularly significant, the question then turns to other impacts. 
Ukraine is directly on the main route utilized for Europe- Asian flights and was the site of the shoot-down of 
Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in July 2014 at the start of the conflict over the Eastern regions of Ukraine. Further 
hostilities or outright war will likely cause severe disruptions with routing for aircraft away from Ukrainian and 
Russian airspace near the conflict zone, extending both the time and costs for long-haul flights. It could even result 
in total blocking, hence the suspension of civil air traffic via Russia. But given the current restrictions in Japan and 
China, frequencies on many of those routes have been temporarily reduced, although other Asian carriers use 
Russian airspace to and from Europe. Given Covid restrictions, the impact of route restrictions seems to be 
minimal. 
A conflict in the region, which could spread into Europe, could significantly destabilize the continent and have a far-
reaching impact on the world's economy. In the build-up to the conflict, global oil prices have already gone up. They 
could increase from 10-25 percent, depending on the length and severity of a conflict. Fuel costs account for nearly 
50 percent of costs for ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air, and about 35 percent for network carriers 
like IAG (British Airways, Iberia), Lufthansa Group, and Air France-KLM. While most of the airlines in Europe have 
fuel hedges[1] for on average about 50 percent of their needs, it is notable that Wizz Air has not yet hedged fuel in 
2022, and could be negatively impacted by the rise in fuel prices. 
Overall, the impact of a Ukrainian conflict should be relatively mild for European carriers and limited to the 
economic impact of higher fuel prices. Unless an extended conflict spreads to other regions and into Europe and 
the safety of air travel becomes a factor.

Feb 08, 2022( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 The news broke early yesterday, and people couldn't stop talking about it Maury Gallagher is retiring as CEO of 
Allegiant[1]! Oh wait, not that bit of news, though a hearty congratulations to Maury. Of course, the biggest news of 
the day was that Frontier and Spirit will merge[2]. Finally. This has been rumored and suggested for so long that it's 
almost anti-climactic. 
Spirit and Frontier will come together to form the 5th largest airline in the US and become a clear leader among 
ultra low cost carriers (ULCC). This may sound like an enormous airline, but put it in context. According to Cirium 
data[3], in March 2022, Ryanair will still be almost twice as large in terms of seats. 
Original photos via Spirit and Frontier 
The two airlines' paths have crossed time and time again over the years. Spirit was the original ULCC in the US, but 
Frontier got there eventually. And when Indigo Partners saw what Frontier was doing and how cheap it could buy 
the airline from wayward owner Republic, Indigo dumped its holdings in Spirit and bought up Frontier instead. 
Frontier's CEO, Barry Biffle, learned his ULCC chops at Spirit. 
Now, the two airlines will come together in a surprising way. Frontier shareholders will own 51.5 percent of the new 
company while Spirit shareholders will own only 48.5 percent. This control doesn't come cheap as Frontier will pay 
Spirit shareholders 1.9126 shares in the new company plus $2.13 for each Spirit share they own today. Spirit, after 
all, is the larger airline. Its full year 2021 revenues were $3.175 billion while Frontier's were $2.060 billion. Spirit 
ended 2021 with 173 airplanes while Frontier had only 110. But why does Frontier care about having control? This 
is the Bill Franke show. 
Bill Franke runs the Indigo Partners private equity group which has been behind all sorts of ULCCs around the 
world, most of them successes like Wizz Air and Volaris but some not so much. (Look up Avianova in Russia[4].) 
Indigo has been wildly successful in the US, both when it bought and eventually sold its stake in Spirit and with its 
cheap acquisition and subsequent IPO at Frontier. The assumption was that Indigo would eventually bring these 
two airlines together, and that is what's happening here. 
The new airline will have Bill Franke as the Chairman of the Board, and he will lead the search for the management 
team, but that's about all we know. The surviving name hasn't been chosen, nor has the headquarters city or 
anyone on the management team. There is very likely a good reason for this. 
Money. 
Spirit and Frontier: Together At Last
There is plenty in the investor presentation[5] about how this will be good for consumers and will create 
opportunities and all that, but let's remember that when Frontier went public, it took the ULCC ticker symbol. Low 
costs are the key to everything for this airline, because that's what enables low fares. There will clearly be an effort 
to get costs even lower than they already are through — and I hate the word — synergies. 
Spirit's unit cost stage-length adjusted ex-fuel and special items for 2021 was .41 cents higher than Frontier's, and 
both are very low in comparison to others. These are higher than they should be, and they will come down once 
pandemic-related issues are further behind the airline, but the fact that Frontier is lower than Spirit shows just how 
serious that airline is about costs. 
I have little doubt that Indigo will use every opportunity it can to bring down those costs. A headquarters competition 
between South Florida and Denver? Oh yeah, that's a great way to squeeze out every penny from the locals. The 
name can be used as a bargaining chip if any one area cares about it, kind of like how Dallas/Fort Worth would 
have freaked out if US Airways survived. Presumably all else being equal, Indigo would go with Spirit as the name 
since that means there are fewer airplanes to paint. But I imagine everything is on the table if there is money to be 
made. 
As for the management team, well, I'll be curious to see where that goes. I have little doubt that some of the current 
people running the airlines will just want to leave. They've been through a lot, and a merger is not easy. But 
otherwise, Bill will pick and choose those who he thinks can best create the ultimate ULCC. What exactly that 
means isn't yet clear since both airlines have come to different conclusions in some areas despite having the same 
goals. 
Yes, both airlines have a similar basic model. They use Airbus narrowbodies to serve mostly big cities to appeal to 
the leisure traveler. They both have an unbundled model that has a low base fare along with the option to either buy 
a la carte or add bundles to get to the product each traveler wants. Spirit is based in Florida while Frontier is based 
in Denver, and the networks are largely complementary with the main overlap being in Florida itself, a good place to 
be in these days of heavy leisure demand. 
In fact, looking at March, Spirit has nearly 62 percent of its departures touching Florida on one end while Frontier 
has more than 52 percent. If we look at the route map, these are the airports that have more than 3 percent of 
departures for each airline. 
Frontier and Spirit Largest Airports March 2022 
Frontier and Spirit are large and will get larger in Florida and Las Vegas, the two biggest leisure destinations in the 
Continental US and also — not coincidentally — the largest places in Allegiant's operation. Spirit brings its legacy 
presence in Detroit along with Houston and Atlanta to the mix while Frontier adds Denver, of course, and Philly. 
Chicago is big for both, though Frontier has been shifting its service to Midway. 
This will help both airlines to increase coverage, but the differences go much deeper than this. There is a 
philosophical difference in how the airlines build their networks. 
Frequencies by Route March 2022 
Spirit has long had a focus on serving routes at least once a day. Sure, it has some that go less, but for Frontier, 
sub-daily is the airline's bread and butter. Now, you bring them together, and do the philosophies change? Does 
one win out? Or does it truly just become a combination of both, serving cities big and small with varying 
frequencies as needed? 
These are all questions that will be answered over time. We'll also see whether the Big Front Seat (domestic First 
Class with no extra service) survives or if Stretch seating (extra legroom coach) will win out. I find myself assuming 
that we'll see Stretch win if it pays for itself, which it probably does or Frontier would have given it up long ago. But 
we won't have any idea of the actual direction until we learn the management team's makeup. 
In the meantime, it's all about presenting sunshine and rainbows and convincing the feds to allow the merger to go 
through without a challenge. It's hard to see how a challenge would be successful here. What would they want the 
airline to give up? Gates in Orlando? Then again, this DOJ is doing odd things with the whole challenge of the 
American-JetBlue Northeast Alliance, so who knows what will happen. 
Overall, I like this merger, and I think it's been a long time coming. That being said, I should reserve my full 
judgment until we get more details than the sparse information we learned yesterday.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of 48 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Dec 31, 
2021), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the amount of loss narrowed by 70.4% 
year over year. Results were hurt by Omicron-induced travel restrictions in December, which weakened close-in 
bookings and fares for the Christmas and New Year travel period. 
Quarterly revenues of $1,681.1 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,792.2 million but improved 
more than 400% from the year-ago period with significant improvement in traffic owing to strong bookings in 
October and November. 
Ryanair's net loss for the quarter came in at €96 million compared with the year-ago quarter's loss of €321 million. 
Traffic soared more than 200% year over year to 31.1 million. Load factor in the period was 84%, reflecting an 
improvement of 14 percentage points from the year-ago period. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price, Consensus and EPS

 Geographically, total revenues from Italy (comprised of 24.5% of the top line) climbed more than 200% year over 
year, while the same from Spain (17.6%) jumped more than 300%. Revenues from United Kingdom (12.7%) and 
Ireland (5.3%) soared nearly 300% and more than 400% year over year, respectively. Revenues from other 
European countries (39.9%) skyrocketed more than 300% year over year. 
Scheduled revenues climbed more than 300% year over year due to increase in traffic and average fares. Ancillary 
revenues also jumped more than 300% year over year in the reported quarter due to strong performance in priority 
boarding and reserved seating, apart from robust traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more than 
200% year over year due to rise in sectors flown and high jet fuel prices. Total operating expenses rose more than 
100% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), had cash of nearly €3 billion as of Dec 31, 2021, 
higher than €3.15 billion as of Mar 31, 2021.

United Airlines' operating revenues of $8,192 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,930.9 
million. Both the top and bottom lines improved significantly year over year, thanks to strong holiday travel demand. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[6], carrying a Zacks Rank #5, reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 3 cents 
from non-recurring items) of 14 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. This

Southwest Airlines' operating revenues of $5,051 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,029

agreement, aided LUV's fourth-quarter performance.

non-recurring items) of 22 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. Earnings came

skyrocketing more than 100% from the year-ago figure as people resorted to air travel during the holidays.

Feb 02, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week,Southwest Airlines LUV[1] reported earnings for fourth-quarter 2021. This was LUV's first 
profitable quarter after seven consecutive losses since the pandemic began in 2020. Alaska Air Group ALK[2] also 
delivered earnings for fourth-quarter 2021. Strong holiday travel demand and favorable pricing aided the December 
quarter's results. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[3], however, continued incurring a quarterly loss, its eighth successive setback. Omicron-
induced turbulence induced Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] to incur a wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter of 
fiscal 2022 (ended Dec 31, 2021). An expansion-related update from Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[5] was also 
available in the past week. 
Read the last Airline stock Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Alaska Air Group's fourth-quarter 
2021 earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of 24 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of 17 cents. In the year-ago period, ALK incurred a loss of $2.55. Operating revenues of $1,899 million 
outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,841.8 million. 
Alaska Air, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), expects first-quarter 2022 revenues to drop in the 14-
17% range. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 15-18%. The unfavorable guidance 
includes a 7-point headwind due to the trimming of capacity. ALK estimates economic fuel cost per gallon in the 
band of $2.45-$2.50.[7] 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. Southwest Airlines reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 14 
cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. In the year-ago period, LUV had 
incurred a loss of $1.29 per share. Strong holiday travel demand during November and December, as well as 
incremental revenues generated from the company's new co-brand credit card agreement, aided LUV's fourth-
quarter performance. 
Operating revenues of $5,051 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,029 million and also 
jumped more than 100% year over year. Due to Omicron-induced staffing issues and bad weather conditions, 
Southwest Airlines expects to incur a loss in the first quarter of 2022[9].

3. JetBlue incurred a fourth-quarter 2021 loss (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 36 cents per share, 
comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 40 cents. 
JetBlue expects first-quarter 2022capacity in the range of (1)-2% compared with the figure reported in the first 
quarter of 2019. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 13-15%. Total revenues are forecast to 
drop in the 11-16% range. Average fuel cost per gallon in the March quarter is estimated to be $2.59. Management 
expects the Omicron impact to be short term[10]. 
4. Ryanair Holdings incurred a loss of 48 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, wider than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate by a penny. Results were hurt by Omicron-induced travel restrictions in December, which 
weakened close-in bookings and fares for Christmas and the New Year travel period. Quarterly revenues of 
$1,681.1 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,792.2 million but improved more than 400% from 
the year-ago period's actuals with a significant improvement in traffic owing to strong bookings in October and 
November. 
Ryanair's net loss for the quarter came in at €96 million compared with the year-ago quarter's loss of €321 million. 
Traffic soared more than 200% year over year to 31.1 million. Geographically, total revenues from Italy (comprised 
24.5% of the top line) climbed more than 200% year over year, while the same from Spain (17.6%) jumped more 
than 300%. Revenues from the United Kingdom (12.7%) and Ireland (5.3%) soared nearly 300% and more than 
400% year over year, respectively. Revenues from other European countries (39.9%) skyrocketed more than 300% 
year over year. 
5. With air-travel demand improving in the United States as more people get vaccinated every day, Allegiant Travel 
intends to increase options for its passengers this spring with its latest network expansion to vacation destinations 
like Nashville, Savannah, Roanoke and San Diego. ALGT announced nine new non-stop routes from its bases in 
the United States, offering more options for leisure travelers. 
This move comes when Allegiant Travel prepares for a busy spring season. Drew Wells, Allegiant's senior vice 
president of revenue and planning stated, 'We're thrilled to kick off 2022 with a network expansion in twelve of our 
markets'. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past

Ryanair prepares price cuts as it warns of 'hugely uncertain' financial outlook
Ryanair prepares price cuts as it warns of 'hugely uncertain' financial

 Ryanair is preparing to slash prices to lure customers back on to its planes before the spring, as it warned of a 
'hugely uncertain' financial outlook. 
The Irish-listed carrier said 'media hysteria' over the Omicron variant had worsened its losses in the last quarter of 
2021 and shareholders could expect further disruption from Covid, although it was gearing up to run more flights 
overall this summer than before the coronavirus pandemic struck. 
 Ryanair made a loss of €96m (80m) in the last three months of last year - despite revenues four times higher than 
the autumn of 2020, when stricter international travel restrictions were still in place. 
 Its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said the first three months of 2022 would require 'significant price stimulation 
at lower prices' to attract customers. The airline cut its capacity for January by a third after December passenger 
numbers dropped 1.5 million below forecast after Omicron hit travel. 
 O'Leary said recent bookings had improved after the easing of travel restrictions but passengers were still booking 
later and nearer departure. The airline did not change its forecast for a full-year loss to March of €250m-€450m - a 
wider than usual range. 
 O'Leary added: 'This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we 
would caution all shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the 
world can finally declare that the Covid crisis is behind us.' 
 The chief financial officer said the legacy of the pandemic could mean a long-term change to airline practices, 
including wearing masks on board. 
 Neil Sorahan told the Telegraph: 'Masks will be something that will be with us for a while longer to come. It's a bit 
like after 9/11, we ended up with our toiletries in plastic bags, maybe we'll have to live with masks for a while 
longer.' 
 The current high price of fuel was not a concern, Sorahan said: 'We're the best-hedged airline in Europe at the 
moment - fuel trading over $91 a barrel this morning we've locked in our fuel requirements at $60 a barrel so we're 
in very good position on that over the next 15 months.' 
Ryanair prepares price cuts as it warns of 'hugely uncertain' financial outlook
 Ryanair meanwhile retained ambitions to open bases in Ukraine, should tensions with its neighbour recede, 
O'Leary said: 'If it is not invaded by Russia, it is a country where we would expect to open a couple of bases Some 
time in the next two or three years subject to agreements on costs.' 
 Route planners had visited Ukraine again this month but the authorities were not in a position to discuss Ryanair's 
expansion plans, O'Leary said, 'as they were somewhat otherwise distracted'. 
 The airline is targeting growth to 225 million passengers a year by 2026, and has taken delivery of 41 Boeing 737 
Max aircraft, after years of delays after design flaws caused two fatal crashes. 
 O'Leary has repeatedly described the Boeing 737 Max as a 'game-changer' for the airline, offering lower costs and 
lower carbon emissions per flight. 
 However, its overall footprint will grow: the planned 50% growth over the next five years would be accompanied by 
only a 16% reduction in fuel use per new plane. It hopes to cut fuel use per passenger by another 10% over the 
next decade by using synthetic fuels, which are not currently available at scale. 
 Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, a stockbroker, said Ryanair was positioned for a strong recovery, adding: 
'There is growing industry optimism that summer 2022 could represent a near-normal trading period, with strong 
pent-up demand exceeding restrained industry capacity, so long as international travel restrictions continue to 
ease.'

 Ryanair[1] is being 'wary and cautious' on new Covid-variants popping up in the next three to six months. Without 
them, the Irish carrier should have a strong end of its FY22 and start of FY23, which begins in April. Omicron has 
spoiled December, January, and part of February, but the low-cost carrier expects a strong recovery from mid-
February. This should lead to 114-115 percent capacity in the coming summer, it said on January 31 in its Q3 
results. Price stimulation continues to eat into Ryanair's yields. 
 The October-December quarter started strong, but after the emergence of Omicron and the 'media hysteria' that 
caused governments to go into new restrictions, the crucial Christmas season partly collapsed. Instead of the 
projected eleven million passengers, Ryanair carried 9.5 million in December. It responded with a 33 percent 
capacity reduction for January. It now expects to carry around seven million passengers this quarter, the high-end 
of its previous guidance[2] of six to seven million. 
 During Q3, Ryanair reported a €96 million net loss compared to €321 million in the same quarter in 2020. 
Revenues were up to €1.47 billion from €340 million, with ancillary revenues eight percent higher to €22 per 
passenger. The airline carried 31.1 million passengers this quarter, up from 8.1 million in Q3 FY2021. The load 
factor was 84 percent, the highest of all European carriers. Operating costs increased 136 percent to €1.59 billion, 
mainly due to higher variable costs like fuel, operating and handling, and route charges, offset by fuel efficiencies by 
flying more Boeing MAX aircraft. 
 The Irish carrier said in 2020 that it would no longer fully hedge fuel. It has hedged over sixty percent of fuel for the 
current fourth quarter with jet swaps and caps. In the first six months of FY23 (April-September), fuel has been 
hedged eighty percent and the second half at seventy percent. It also has fully hedged carbon credits for the full 
FY22 and eighty percent of FY23. 
Ryanair bussy recruiting pilots and cabin staff 
Despite the capacity reduction for this month, Ryanair keeps all its staff current. It has agreed on new and extended 
pay deals with employees. Currently, some 1.000 pilots and up to 2.000 cabin crew are being recruited and trained, 
with up to 6.000 new staff to be recruited in the five next years. The carrier says it has no staffing issues right now, 
but labor flexibility in the post-Brexit UK is causing some concerns. It also negotiated new long-term contracts with 
various airports and will open fifteen new bases and 720 new routes, although it ended its contract with Frankfurt 
Price stimulation continues to eat into Ryanair 's yields
Airport as it thought its fares are too high. The airline will base some 21 aircraft in Vienna to strengthen its position 
here and grow capacity in Ireland and Portugal too.  
 At the end of December, Ryanair had just under €3.0 billion in cash plus €10 billion in assets, including ninety 
percent as an unencumbered fleet. Total debt stood at €5.1 billion, of which €2.1 billion in net debt, down from €2.3 
billion in March. The airline plans to reduce its debt as quickly as possible. It already repaid 600 million it received in 
payroll support under the UK's CCFF facility in October, five months earlier than was scheduled. 
MAX 8200 fleet to grow to 65 this summer  
On the fleet, Ryanair has grown its MAX 8200 'Gamechanger' fleet to 41 until December 31, thanks to higher 
deliveries from Boeing. It expects another 24 aircraft until this summer to bring the total to 65 MAX 8200s, a year 
later than originally planned. The carrier has210 high-capacity MAX[3] on order, which will be distributed over 
Ryanair, Malta Air, and Buzz. Fuel burn of the MAX is better than the advertised sixteen percent. Buzz currently has 
55 Boeing 737-800s and MAX 8200s, Malta Air some 140, Lauda 29 Airbus A320ceo's, and Ryanair UK operates 
with just under ten aircraft. CEO Michael O'Leary said that he currently isn't in negotiations with Boeing or Airbus for 
more aircraft. He still regretted that he and Boeing have beenunable to clinch a deal[4] on the MAX 10 after they 
couldn't agree on the price. 
 The recovery that Ryanair is seeing with close-in bookings from mid-February comes at a price. It continues price 
stimulation with low fares to keep load factors up, but this eats into its revenues and yields. 'Pricing remains very 
sensitive to new flow In our build-up, we are aggressively selling low fares than we would have before', said 
O'Leary. It maintains its FY22 guidance for a €250 to €450 million full-year loss and 100 million passengers carried. 
But if the recovery continues, Ryanair should be on track to grow to 225 million passengers in FY26. For this, it will 
need a fleet of 620-630 aircraft, so it has decided to keep some of its Boeing 737-800s on for longer instead of 
selling them off.

 EasyJet plunged 213 million into the red in the Christmas quarter and is still burning through 150 million in cash 
each month, putting its Covid-19 losses at 2.2 billion. 
The short-haul European airline, the second largest behind Ryanair with more than 300 aircraft in its fleet, said 
yesterday that it was still operating at only 50 per cent of normal capacity but that an increase through Easter and 
the spring should bring it back near to pre-pandemic levels for the key summer holiday season. 
 With deep losses expected again in the January-to-March quarter, traditionally its toughest, City analysts are not 
expecting a summer recovery to return the airline to profit this year. 
 EasyJet's losses in the three months to the end of December, the first quarter of its financial year, were half the 
deficit it recorded in the same period a year earlier, but even after flying much-reduced schedules to fit demand, the 
losses were still deep compared with more normal times. Before the pandemic, the Christmas trading quarter 
typically might have been expected to operate at about break-even. 
 The airline's shares have suffered during the pandemic. Shares in Ryanair and Wizz Air, the ambitious budget 
carrier snapping at its tailfins, have been brought back up to roughly pre-pandemic levels, but easyJet's stock more 
than halved and pretty much stayed there. Investors have been worried about whether it would be able to stay the 
course and the airline eventually undertook a 1.2 billion fundraising with its shareholders last autumn to shore up its 
balance sheet. 
 EasyJet's shares edged up p, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 635p yesterday. That is up from the 500p level they hit 
as the Omicron coronavirus variant spread across Europe before Christmas, but below from the 10 level at which 
they were trading during a rally last spring. Before the pandemic hit Europe, the shares were above 15. 
 An end to travel restrictions around Europe, hopes that Omicron infections would recede and a belief in strong 
pent-up demand from holidaymakers led Johan Lundgren, 55, the chief executive, to strike a bullish note. 'Booking 
volumes jumped in the UK following the welcome reduction of travel restrictions announced on January 5, which 
have been sustained and given a further boost from the UK government's decision this week to remove all testing 
requirements,' he said. 
 'We believe testing for travel across our network should soon become a thing of the past. We see a strong summer 
ahead, with pent-up demand that will see easyJet returning to near-2019 levels of capacity, with UK beach and 
EasyJet lands 2.2bn Covid loss after Christmas in red
leisure routes performing particularly well.' EasyJet is the dominant airline at Gatwick, Britain's second largest 
airport, where with British Airways, its main rival there, cutting its operations, it will account for half of all flights. 
 The airline's more immediate outlook remains cautious and it is selling tickets for only 67 per cent of its normal 
capacity this quarter. That is not much higher than in the previous quarter, which came in at 64 per cent. 
 It also conceded that it had not achieved its guidance of expecting to fly its aircraft at 80 per cent full. Gerald Khoo, 
analyst at Liberum, the stockbroker, thinks that easyJet will eventually be a winner in the aviation recovery but is 
pencilling in a 25 million loss for this financial year before it returns to more normal profit levels of 490 million in 
2022-23.

 U.S. Charges Belarusian Officials with Aircraft Piracy[1] The United States recently charged four Belarusian 
officials with conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy in connection with a fake bomb threat to Ryanair Flight 4978, 
which led to the grounding of the plane in Minsk on May 23 and the arrest of the journalist and government critic 
Roman Protasevich. U.S. prosecutors filed the charges in federal court in New York. 
 Under U.S. law[2], 49 U.S.C. 46502, aircraft piracy is defined as "seizing or exercising control of an aircraft in the 
special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States by force, violence, threat of force or violence, or any form of 
intimidation, and with wrongful intent." The Ryanair Flight is not within the "special aircraft jurisdiction" of the U.S. 
because it was not a U.S. aircraft and was not scheduled to land in the U.S. It was traveling between Greece and 
Lithuania when it was diverted. However, the United States claims jurisdiction over aircraft not within its special 
aircraft jurisdiction if U.S. nationals are on board the aircraft or if the offender is a U.S. national. In this case, news 
reports[3] indicate there were four U.S. nationals on board Ryanair Flight 4978 along with approximately 130 other 
passengers. Whether the actions of the Belarusian officials amount to force, violence, or intimidation, rather than 
trickery, is open to debate. 
 49 U.S.C. 46502 is part of the U.S. implementation of the 1970 Convention for the Suppression of the Unlawful 
Seizure of Aircraft[4], to which both the U.S. and Belarus are parties. States party to that Convention have a duty to 
prosecute or extradite defendants. However, that Convention defines the offense as being committed by a person 
on board the aircraft. This limitation may present problems for the prosecution under the facts of this case were the 
U.S. to rely on that Convention. There are other international conventions that also may apply, such as the Chicago 
and Montreal Conventions, if the U.S. chooses to look to international law. But it appears[5] that the U.S. 
prosecutors have decided to keep it a bit simpler by bringing only a one-count indictment under U.S. law. 
 The four defendants currently remain in Belarus. If convicted, they could face 20 years in prison.

Potash Outlook 2022: Supply Disruptions Push Prices to 13 Year High
Potash Outlook 2022: Supply Disruptions Push Prices to 13 Year High

 Click here[1] to read the previous potash outlook. 
 Logistical woes and US sanctions against Belarus added major tailwinds to the potash market in 2021 as prices for 
the valuable fertilizer component soared to US$650 per tonne for the first time since 2008. 
With shipments stymied as a residual result of pandemic-related disruptions, downstream costs for potash spiked to 
a 13 year high during the second half of the year and remain elevated. 
The potash market relies heavily on rail and sea transport, so continued disturbances due to COVID-19 were only 
exacerbated as flooding in BC, Canada ― the leading potash-producing country[2] ― impacted freight movement. 
2021 was especially beneficial for muriate of potash (MOP), the more commonly used of the two potash types[3]. 
As Andy Hemphill, ICIS Fertilizers' senior markets editor, explained, high energy[4] prices, limited supply and strong 
demand throughout the year aided in price growth. 
'Specifically for potash, unlike many other industries ― and indeed, rival fertilizers ― MOP offers were firm 
throughout 2021, and the necessity of food production insulated the industry from the worst ravages of coronavirus-
related lockdowns and logistical mayhem,' he said. 'Added to this is concern for supply stemming from sanctions on 
key supplier Belarus' potash exports via Lithuania, which is still unresolved as of early 2022.' 
 Potash outlook 2022: Potential supply challenges ahead  
Mounting sanctions against Belarus specifically targeting the nation's potash sector added uncertainty to the space 
in Q2 of last year and continue to motivate price activity. 
 The European country ranked third in potash production in 2020, with output totaling 7.3 million metric tonnes (MT). 
It is estimated that global demand for MOP rose to 56 million MT in 2020, up from 2019's 49 million MT. 
In June, the European Union (EU) began levying sanctions on Belarus in response to Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko's mounting human rights abuses. 
'By late June 2021, rumours and speculation indicated Belarus' prized money-spinning MOP export operation would 
soon be subject to sanctions, following the forced grounding of a passenger airliner by Belarusian authorities and 
the removal of activist and journalist Roman Protasevich from a Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[5]) flight,' said Hemphill, 
noting that the activist remains in detention.  
Potash Outlook 2022: Supply Disruptions Push Prices to 13 Year High
'Four days later, the speculation was proven true, as the European Council slapped sanctions on 78 individuals and 
eight entities, including a ban on travel to the EU and the freezing of assets.' 
The legislation, which passed on June 24, states, 'It shall be prohibited to import, purchase or transfer, directly or 
indirectly, potassium chloride (potash) products listed in Annex VIII from Belarus, whether or not originating in 
Belarus.' The sanctions target an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the potash exported by Belarus. 
The move drove potash prices higher over the second half of the year, and was exacerbated when the US levied its 
own sanctions[6] against Belarus and the Lukashenka regime at the end of the year. 
'Then, compounding the issue, MOP marketing arm Belarusian Potash Company (BPC) itself ― which previously 
dodged the majority of the sanctions, which were instead placed on Belaruskali, the country's state-run mining arm 
― was sanctioned by the US in early December,' Hemphill said. 
Potash prices responded with a dramatic spike, reaching the the US$650 range. 
The US penalties on Belarusian potash will come into full effect in April 2022, the deadline Washington gave BPC's 
clients ― including India, China and Brazil ― to wind down business. Additionally, American sanctions will inhibit 
BPC's ability to access dollar-based financial services, impeding trade on international markets. 
'This is set to upend global MOP trade flows, especially if Lithuania blocks the transit of potash via Klaipeda port,' 
Chris Lawson, head of fertilizers at CRU Group, wrote in a market overview[7]. 'However, we do not expect a 
complete halt of exports from Belarus.' 
For Hemphill, the situation 'leaves BPC's buyers with some questions, and so far no accompanying answers.' 
Several questions the senior markets editor mentioned include: If Lithuania's port becomes unavailable, can 
Lukashenko thrash out an agreement to transport tonnes via train to Russian ports for export?Would such a route 
offer the security of supply MOP buyers demand in a market witnessing decade-high prices?Would a jaunt across 
Russia increase logistics costs so much that rival MOP majors' tonnes will appear more agreeably priced for 
buyers? For now, with prices sitting at a decade high and supply from the market's third largest producer facing 
global sanctions, the future is full of uncertainty. Add to that strong grower economics and historically low grain and 
grape seed inventories, and potash prices could continue their upward trend well into the new year. 
 Potash outlook 2022: Miners benefit amid market volatility  
As pressure mounts against Belarus' potash sector, production in Canada has become increasingly important. 
Shares of leading producer Nutrien (TSX:NTR[8],NYSE:NTR) have climbed 38 percent over the last 12 months.  
In its Q3 earnings report, the Canadian miner credits 'decisive actions we made across our business units and 
leveraging our competitive advantages to benefit from strong market fundamentals' as factors that aided growth. 
Nutrien's 2021 share price performance. 
 Chart via Trading Economics[9]. 
 Over the first nine months of 2021, Nutrien reported record adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortization (EBITDA) of US$4.7 billion. 
Additionally, the Canadian company, which has six potash mines in Saskatchewan, achieved record production and 
sales volumes of nearly 7 million MT[10] during the first six months of 2021. 
Demand is forecast to continue trending up this year amid positive market fundamentals. 'We expect growers to 
maximize planted acreage and yields in 2022 as projected US grower corn and soybean margins are approximately 
60 percent and 35 percent, respectively, above 10-year average levels,' Nutrien's Q3 statement[11] notes. 
In South America, Brazilian growers were anticipated to increase total plantings by 5 million to 7 million acres amid 
record grower profitability and supportive rainfall. 
However, Brazil has seen spot MOP prices skyrocket to the US$800 range since December, potentially impacting 
soybean crops. Some analysts are speculating that prices could move as high as US$900 to US$950 in Brazil in 
Q1. 
 Potash outlook 2022: Potential price motivators  
While some of the factors that impacted the potash market in 2021 will remain relevant as 2022 carries on, CRU 
sees various more prevalent issues easing, helping to alleviate upward price pressure. 
By the end of the Q1 2022, the business intelligence company sees 2021's freight challenges subsiding following a 
year that saw freight rates on the main dry bulk trade routes rise between 33 and 120 percent. 
Potash Outlook 2022: Supply Disruptions Push Prices to 13 Year High
'Rates have recently declined, and we anticipate this trend to continue,' the firm's January fertilizer overview[12] 
reads. 'Bulk freights are anticipated to be close to historical norms by the end of Q1.' 
While growers will get some relief in terms of downstream freight costs, gas[13] prices are expected to remain 
elevated, which will add to production and transport overhead. 
Longer term, the continued impact of climate change ― which among other things is making crop growth more 
difficult ― will also have an effect on the potash market. 
'It's certainly a factor to consider, but the growing global population is by far the bigger influence on supply/demand 
dynamics,' Hemphill said. 'People have to eat, and fertilizers are the key to meeting that demand. Potash supply 
and demand will continue to increase over the next 10 years.' 
Making crop growth more challenging is only one of the potential effects climate change may have on the potash 
market.  
In a September report[14], Fertilizer Canada responded to the Canadian government's proposal to reduce on-farm 
emissions by 30 percent. The agricultural[15] group, which represents manufacturers, wholesalers and retail 
distributors, estimates that cutting fertilizer use to reduce on-farm emissions could cost growers nearly C$48 billion 
over the next eight years. 
'If Canada adopted the EU model, the potential economic impact of reduced fertilizer use would be devastating to 
Canadian farmers,' the report reads. 'To avoid this, any plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be done 
through sustainable agricultural intensification; an approach that allows for significant reductions in agricultural 
emissions without risking Canada's contribution to global supply of food or economic growth within the sector.' 
South of the border, US farmers are demanding an investigation into the broad fertilizer industry. 
In December, US agricultural research and policy non-profit Family Farm Action Alliance (FFAA) called on the 
Department of Justice[16] to launch an antitrust investigation into high fertilizer prices. 
The FFAA called fertilizer producers a 'monopoly power' that is using unfair pricing tactics. While the US 
government decides whether to investigate, there are still the sanctions on Belarusian potash. 
'Despite the bluster and political maneuvering, the lack of official comment from the Belarusian government and its 
state-run potash firms on the plans for future potash exports has left buyers ― which need to secure tonnes early 
due to a month or more lead times from mine to field ― deeply concerned," Hemphill said. 'Some speculate BPC is 
keeping its cards close on the possibility of exporting via Russia, while investors are buying into rival majors, and in 
some cases, throwing their lot in with smaller, upcoming players.' 
For Hemphill, the question is whether buyers are willing to purchase tonnes at these high rates forever, move away 
to a different fertilizer or simply buy lower-quality blends or mixed tonnes instead. 
As 2022 progresses, CRU sees prices trending lower despite the market uncertainty. 
'We forecast a correction in prices, but not immediately. Gas/coal[17] prices remain high, and supply is tight. Prices 
are expected to hold at high levels over Q1. Declines will begin in Q2, with more stark corrections in H2," said the 
firm.

UN GATE, Jan 20 - Right after dissident blogger Pratasevich was grabbed off a Ryan Air flight forced to land in 
Belarus, many including the US spoke. 
 But for more than a full day, nothing from Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General who rarely takes questions 
and even had the Press which asked him about the mass killings in Cameroonthrown out[9]of the UN. Alerthere[10]; 
Belarus Blues songhere.[11] 
 On January 20, 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York which Inner City Press covers 
daily, banned from the UN for its questions, this: "the filing of a one-count indictment charging LEONID 
MIKALAEVICH CHURO, the Director General of Belaeronavigatsia Republican Unitary Air Navigation Services 
Enterprise ('Belaeronavigatsia'), the Belarusian state air navigation authority; OLEG KAZYUCHITS, the Deputy 
Director General of Belaeronavigatsia; and two officers of the Belarusian state security services, ANDREY 
ANATOLIEVICH LNU and FNU LNU, with conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy for engineering the diversion of 
Ryanair Flight 4978 (the 'Flight')—which was carrying four U.S. nationals and more than 100 other passengers on 
board—while it was in flight over Belarus on May 23, 2021, for the purpose of arresting a dissident Belarusian 
journalist who was on board the Flight. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer." 
 But they remain at large. Guess who is NOT coming to Disney World? 
 On December 2 US Antony Blinken said, "In coordination with international allies and partners, today we are taking 
additional measures to raise the cost on Alyaksandr Lukashenka and his regime for their ongoing attacks on 
democracy, human rights, and international norms, and for their brutal repression of Belarusians both inside and 
outside the country. These steps represent our third coordinated action with allies this year and are a further 
consequence of the Belarusian authorities continued flagrant disregard for human rights and Belarus's failure to 
comply with its obligations under international human rights law. Pursuant to Executive Orders 13405 and 14038, 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has identified three aircraft as 
blocked property and designated 32 individuals and entities, including Belarusian state-owned enterprises, 
After Belarus Downed Ryanair to Grab Pratasevich SDNY Indictments of Officials at Large
government officials, and other persons, who support the regime and facilitate its repression. Additionally, OFAC 
has issued a directive prohibiting certain activities involving new debt with a maturity of greater than 90 days issued 
by the Belarusian Ministry of Finance or the Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus." 
 On July 5, the UN was promoting a HRC 47 session by its special rapporteur on Belarus Anais Marin. But just a 
few minutes into her presentation on UNTV to an empty room in Geneva, the webcast went dark. They claim it went 
all of 29 minutes, but after Minute 13, it is silent darkness, seehere[12], and FUNCA Questionhere[13]. This is 
Antonio Guterres' UN - a place of incompetence, unaccountability and censorship. It must change. 
 Now late and hypocritical, given that they have done nothing about Guterresbanning[14]Inner City Press now for 
1099 days amid its questions, this: "The co-chairs of the United Nations Group of Friends for the Protection of 
Journalists - Greece, France and Lithuania - and the undersigned Members of the Group of Friends strongly 
condemn the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on May 23, 2021, prompted by Belarusian 
authorities in order to arrest and detain independent journalist Raman Pratasevich and his companion, Sofia 
Sapega...

Jan 20, 2022( Justice Department News: https://www.justice.gov/justice-news Delivered by Newstex)  
 A federal grand jury in New York returned an indictment today charging four Belarusian state officials with 
conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy. 
According to court documents, Leonid Mikalaevich Churo, Oleg Kazyuchits, Andrey Anatolievich Lnu and Fnu Lnu, 
all of Belarus, allegedly engineered the diversion of Ryanair Flight 4978 (the Flight) - which was carrying four U.S. 
nationals and more than 100 other passengers on board - while it was in flight on May 23, 2021, to arrest a 
dissident Belarusian journalist who was on board. 
'Since the dawn of powered flight, countries around the world have cooperated to keep passenger airplanes safe,' 
said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. 'The defendants shattered those 
standards by diverting an airplane to further the improper purpose of repressing dissent and free speech. Thanks to 
the extraordinary investigative work of a joint team of FBI counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigators, 
today's indictment provides a prompt and public explanation of what actually happened to the Flight. We are 
committed to holding accountable these central participants in a shocking conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy that 
not only violated international norms and U.S. criminal law, but also potentially endangered the lives of four U.S. 
citizens and scores of other innocent passengers on board.'  
'We allege the defendants carried out an elaborate scheme to fake a bomb scare which forced an airplane to make 
an emergency landing in their country so they could arrest a dissident journalist,' said Assistant Director Michael J. 
Driscoll of the FBI's New York Field Office. 'During the course of our investigation, the FBI identified a detailed 
operation that subjected passengers from many countries, including the U.S., to the realities of terroristic threats. 
Not only is what took place a reckless violation of U.S. law, it's extremely dangerous to the safety of everyone who 
flies in an airplane. The next pilot who gets a distress call from a tower may doubt the authenticity of the emergency 
- which puts lives at risk. The FBI and our foreign partners will continue to hold perpetrators responsible for actions 
which directly threaten the lives of our US citizens and jeopardize the stability of our national security.' 
Overview of the Plot 
Belarusian Government Officials Charged with Aircraft Piracy for Diverting Ryanair Flight 4978 to Arrest 
Dissident Journalist in May 2021
While on its regularly scheduled passenger route between Athens, Greece, and Vilnius, Lithuania, on May 23, 
2021, the Flight was diverted to Minsk, Belarus, by air traffic control authorities in response to a purported threat of 
a bomb on board the aircraft. There was, in fact, no bomb on board the aircraft. Belarusian government authorities 
fabricated the threat as a means to exercise control over the Flight and force it to divert from its course toward the 
original destination of Vilnius, and instead land in Minsk. 
The purpose of the Belarusian government's plot diverting the Flight to Minsk was so that Belarusian security 
services could arrest a Belarusian journalist and political activist (Individual-1) - who was critical of the Belarusian 
government, living in exile in Lithuania, and wanted by the Belarusian government on allegations of fomenting 
'mass unrest' - as well as Individual-1's girlfriend (Individual-2). The Belarusian government conspiracy to divert the 
Flight was executed by, among others, officers of the Belarusian state security services working in coordination with 
senior officials of the Belarusian state air navigation authority. 
The Defendants 
The defendants, all Belarusian government officials and critical participants in this conspiracy, are identified as: 
Leonid Mikalaevich Churo, Oleg Kazyuchits, Andrey Anatolievich Lnu and Fnu Lnu. At all times relevant to the 
indictment, Churo was the Director General of Belaeronavigatsia, the Belarusian state air navigation authority. As 
alleged, Churo personally communicated the false bomb threat to staff at the Minsk air traffic control center before 
the Flight even took off from Athens, and directed the control center to instruct the Flight divert to Minsk in response 
to the purported threat. 
Kazyuchits was the Deputy Director General of Belaeronavigatsia, and his role in the conspiracy included directing 
Belarusian air traffic authorities to falsify incident reports regarding the diversion of the Flight in order to conceal the 
fabrication of the bomb threat and to omit the role of Belarusian security services in directing the diversion. 
Andrey Anatolievich Lnu and Fnu Lnu were officers of the Belarusian state security services. Fnu Lnu participated 
with Churo in conveying the false bomb threat to the Minsk air traffic control tower, personally directed the specific 
radio communications from the Minsk tower to coerce the Flight to divert to Minsk, and relayed contemporaneous 
updates on the diversion of the Flight and the progress of the plot to Andrey Anatolievich Lnu, who was Fnu Lnu's 
superior in the Belarusian state security services.  
The Diversion of the Flight 
On May 23, 2021, at approximately 6:45 UTC, Churo and Fnu Lnu arrived at the operations room of the Minsk area 
air traffic control center with responsibility for Belarusian airspace. Churo and Fnu Lnu conveyed the purported 
bomb threat to the controllers on duty, even though the Flight had not yet departed Athens. Churo and Fnu Lnu 
specifically crafted the threat to coerce the pilots of the Flight to avoid continuing to their final destination of Vilnius, 
by claiming that the purported bomb would explode if the Flight landed there. 
In addition, Churo and Fnu Lnu took the telling steps of directing that the Flight be diverted specifically to Minsk, 
and even though the Flight was still in the adjacent airspace of Ukraine, prohibiting the Minsk air traffic control 
center from making any notification to Ukrainian authorities of the purported bomb threat. This helped to ensure that 
the Flight would enter Belarusian airspace, and the plot to obtain and exercise control over the Flight could be 
executed. Fnu Lnu remained in the operations room at the Minsk air traffic control center from the time that he and 
Churo conveyed the purported bomb threat and directed that the Flight divert to Minsk, until shortly before the Flight 
landed in Minsk after being diverted, in order to ensure that the diversion plot was successfully executed. 
Once the Flight reached Belarusian airspace, Fnu Lnu instructed the senior air traffic controller who was 
responsible for communicating with the Flight to inform the pilots of the purported bomb threat, describe that the 
Belarusian Government Officials Charged with Aircraft Piracy for Diverting Ryanair Flight 4978 to Arrest 
Dissident Journalist in May 2021
threat had been sent by email, and make specific statements to ensure the threat seemed credible and to coerce 
the Flight to divert to Minsk. For example, Fnu Lnu directed that the air traffic controller should falsely inform the 
pilots that the threat to the aircraft was a level 'red' - the most specific and credible category of threat. Fnu Lnu 
provided updates on the execution of the plot in real time to his superior in the Belarusian security services, Andry 
Antolievich Lnu, at one point expressing concern that the pilots might be stalling for time and the Flight might soon 
leave Belarusian airspace, which would jeopardize the success of their diversion scheme. In response to the false 
information conveyed as part of the defendants' plot, the pilots of the Flight ultimately declared an emergency and 
diverted to Minsk National Airport, in accordance with the directives from Churo and Fnu Lnu. 
Once the Flight landed in Minsk, Fnu Lnu left the air traffic control operations room and went to the airport tarmac. 
The Flight was met by Belarusian security services personnel, including individuals dressed in camouflage military-
style uniforms, some of whom were wearing ski masks and carrying visible firearms. Fnu Lnu remained on the 
tarmac supervising the security forces and monitoring the screening of the passengers as they disembarked. 
Belarusian security services personnel then instructed the passengers to board one of several airport passenger 
buses. 
Belarusian authorities boarded one of the buses and asked Individual-1 to come forward and identify himself, 
demonstrating that Belarusian authorities were aware that Individual-1 was on board the Flight. Individual-1 was 
escorted off the bus, where uniformed Belarusian officers separately searched him again on the airport tarmac. 
Belarusian officers then escorted Individual-1 back onto the bus and traveled with Individual-1 and the rest of the 
passengers to the airport terminal. Once the bus arrived at the terminal, the Flight's passengers were detained in an 
area of the terminal secured by Belarusian security services. Additional Belarusian security officers met Individual-1 
and the officers accompanying him, escorted Individual-1 away from the remaining passengers and detained 
Individual-1. One group of passengers from the Flight, including multiple U.S. nationals and Individual-2, was 
detained in a narrow hallway for approximately three hours at the airport. During that time, Belarusian authorities 
also escorted Individual-2 away from the other passengers and detained Individual-2. The Flight was ultimately 
allowed to depart from Minsk and continue to its original destination of Vilnius later that evening. No bomb was ever 
on the Flight. 
The Cover-Up 
Soon after the diversion of the Flight, Belarusian government officials began to cover up what had happened. On or 
about May 24, 2021, the day after the Flight was diverted, Churo appeared at a press conference in Belarus with 
other Belarusian officials to address the Flight's diversion. During the press conference, Churo stated falsely the 
Belarusian authorities had 'done everything according to their technology and their job responsibilities' in handling 
the Flight. In reality, Churo knew that he and his co-conspirators had contrived the false bomb threat and had 
directed the Flight to divert to Minsk so that Belarusian security services could arrest Individual-1 and Individual-2. 
To further conceal the defendants' plot, Kazyuchits directed Belarusian air traffic authorities to create false incident 
reports, including by doctoring the reports to misrepresent that the bomb threat was received at approximately the 
same time that the Flight entered Belarusian airspace and omit the fact that Fnu Lnu of the Belarusian security 
services was present in the operations room and directed activity during the Flight's diversion. 
Churo, Kazyuchits, Andrey Anatolievich Lnu and Fnu Lnu, all of Belarus, are charged with conspiring to commit 
aircraft piracy, which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years and maximum statutory penalty of life. A federal 
district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory 
factors. 
The defendants remain at large. The United States looks forward to working with our foreign partners to bring them 
to justice. 
Belarusian Government Officials Charged with Aircraft Piracy for Diverting Ryanair Flight 4978 to Arrest 
Dissident Journalist in May 2021
This case was jointly investigated by the FBI's New York Field Office, Counterintelligence Division Foreign Influence 
Task Force and the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, which principally consists of special agents from the FBI 
and detectives from the NYPD; as well as the FBI Legal Attach Offices in Riga, Latvia; Warsaw, Poland; Athens, 
Greece; Kiev, Ukraine; and London; the National Transportation Safety Board; the Justice Department's National 
Security Division Counterterrorism Section and Criminal Division's Human Rights and Special Prosecutions 
Section, and the Office of International Affairs. Poland's Internal Security Agency and the Mazowieckie Regional 
Prosecutor's Office; and Lithuanian authorities provided valuable assistance with this investigation. 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys David W. Denton Jr. and Elinor L. Tarlow for the Southern District of New York are 
prosecuting the case, with assistance from Trial Attorneys Jennifer Burke of the National Security Division's 
Counterterrorism Section, and Jamie Perry and Christian Levesque of the Criminal Division's Human Rights and 
Special Prosecutions Section. 
An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

 Here's the updated model. 
Both OEMs saw a good recovery 
Boeing won more orders, but it is unclear how many of the 2021[1] orders were rolled from last year 
 Airbus[2] won deliveries handily Airbus and Boeing[3] each have a favorite LCC; IndiGo and Ryanair[4] 
respectively Page 5 & 6 - here we see Boeing's dominance in freighters playing a pivotal role. And why Airbus 
decided on the A350F. Page 8 highlights the A321neos dominance of its segment Page 10 shows how the MAX 
recovery helped Boeing's order[5] book Pages 11 through 12 show MoM performance. Pay special attention to 
MoM 3 - the MoM segment is growing and the absence of a credible (to the market) option from Boeing is glaringly 
obvious. This is confirmed on Page 12.

 Most new products and services are developments or combinations of existing offerings.  
But just adding features can lead to a product overloaded with 'feature bloat'. Instead try giving with one hand and 
taking away with the other. Add something different and take away something of little value.  
Start by focussing on the market leading product (or products). List its top features and identify the benefit which 
customers get from each of the features. What problems are solved and how important are they? Then prioritise the 
list. From a customer perspective[1] which are the most valuable and least valuable features? You may need input 
from a survey or focus group to help at this stage. 
Ask what features could we add to our product to make it more valuable and different. Brainstorm[2] this topic and 
come up with ideas which will appeal to some customers and make your new product stand out. Prioritise the ideas 
by customer appeal and feasibility.  
Now look at the features of the leading product and ask - what elements could we eliminate? In particular look for 
ways to make the product or service simpler, easier to use and cheaper to produce. Focus on the items which are 
of lesser value to the customers but add complexity to the offer. Prioritise two or three.  
Next put together your new product packages. Add and subtract. Can you differentiate your innovation and increase 
the appeal of the product - maybe to a certain segment of the market - by adding something and removing 
something else? Does the new combination work? It does not have to appeal to the whole market. It is more 
important to find one segment which would love it. 
Consider the Apple iPhone compared to the Blackberry. The iPhone [3]added new functionality such as camera and 
music while eliminating the physical keyboard. Similarly with the low-cost airline Ryanair. It eliminated allocated 
seating and travel agents. It added new destinations of smaller airports that the major airlines did not use. And it 
offered lower cost.  
Don't just add features for the sake of adding features. Add something special and at the same time eliminate 
something costly or awkward. Give with one hand and take away with the other.

fotoana fohy taorian'ny nanombohan'ny hetsi-panoherana ny governemanta[12] tao amin'ny firenena taorian'ny

'tsy hanao vivery ny ainy' sy tsy hanatevin-daharana ny fihetsiketsehana faobe. Niala tao Belarosia i 
Tsikhanouskaya fotoana fohy taorian'izay ary nanao fanentanana ho famotsorana ireo gadra politika rehetra. 
 Nanameloka[14] ny fampiroboroboana ilay horonantsary fieken-keloka an-tery[15] ny vondrona mpiaro ny

ireo ary nandika ny Fifanarahan'ny Firenena Mikambana manohitra ny fampijaliana ihany koa. Araka ny nolazain'ny 
sasany tamin'ireo voafonja[17] izay navotsotra taorian'izay, dia nampiasa fampijaliana, herisetra ara-batana ary ara-
tsaina ny sampan-draharaham-piarovan'ny fanjakana mba hahazoana ireo fijoroana vavolombelona voarakitra. 
 Tamin'ny volana Mey 2021, nilaza tamin'ny[18] Rest of World ny mpitondratenin'ny Google fa 'nahatsikaritra ny 
doka roa (manasongadina an'i Pratasevich sy Sapega - GV) ny orinasa ary nandray fepetra araka ny politika 
mikasika ny votoaty tsy mendrika'. Ny Politikam-pitantanana Dokambarotra YouTube dia mandrara an-kitsirano 
ny[19] dokambarotra izay 'manasongadina olona amin'ny fanararaotana na fanorisorenana; ny votoaty milaza fa tsy 
nitranga ny zava-nitranga mampalahelo, na mpilalao sarimihetsika ireo niharam-boina na ny fianakaviany, na miray 
tsikombakomba amin'ny fanafenana ny zava-nitranga'. Mandrara ny kabary fanavakavahana, ny fanararaotana, ny 
fanorisorenana, ary ny votoaty mampiroborobo ny herisetra, mampidi-doza na fihetsika tsy ara-dalna ihany koa ny 
torolalan'ny vondrom-piarahamonina ao amin'ilay sehatra[20]. 
 Na izany aza, nanomboka nanohy namoaka[21] dokan-dahatsary YouTube mitovitovy amin'izany ny fantsona 
Belarosiana mpomba ny governemanta izay mirakitra fiaiken-keloka an-tery ataon'ireo gadra politika hafa sy ny 
propagandy mpomba ny governemanta. 
 Tamin'ny 21 Desambra 2021, nandefa taratasy misokatra[22] ho an'ny tale jeneralin'ny Google Sundar Pichai ny 
lehiben'ny mpanohitra Tsikhanouskaya, nisolo tena ny Filankevitry ny Fandrindrana ny mpanohitra sy ny 
fianakavian'ireo voatazona, nangataka ny Google sy ny YouTube hanaisotra ireo horonantsary manafintohina, 
hanakana ny fametrahana dokambarotra mitovy amin'izany amin'ny manaraka, ary hametra ny fidirana amin'ny 
tolotra ho an'ireo tompon'andraikitra tamin'ny votoaty. 
 Tamin'ny 3 Janoary tamin'ity taona ity, nitatitra i Tikhanovskaya fa nahazo valiny avy amin'i Karan Bhatia, lefitry ny 
Raharaham-panjakana sy ny Politikam-panjakana ao amin'ny Google. 
Following my letter, @Google[23] removed the ads with interrogations of polit. prisoners. By the response letter, the 
accounts running those ads are now restricted. The videos of forced testimonies violate the UN Convention against 
Torture. Thank you @Google[24] for standing by Belarus. pic.twitter .com/qJITO19o2z[25]; 
 — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya (@Tsihanouskaya) January 3, 2022[26] 
 Taorian'ny taratasiko, nesorin'ny @Google[27] ny dokambarotra misy ny fakna am-bavany ireo gadra politika. 
Amin'ny allan'ny valin'ny taratasy, voarara izao ny kaonty mitondra ireo doka ireo. Mandika ny Fifanarahan'ny 
Firenena Mikambana manohitra ny fampijaliana ireo lahatsarin'ny fijoroana vavolombelona an-tery ireo. Misaotra 
anareo @Google[28] noho ny fanohanana an'i Belarosia. pic.twitter .com/qJITO19o2z[29]; 
 — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya (@Tsihanouskaya) Janoary 3, 2022[30] 
 Tao anatin' ilay taratasy[31], nilaza i Bhatia fa nesorin'i Google ireo doka voasokajy ho 'fanitsakitsahana ny 
politikanay' ary 'nametra ny kaonty dokambarotra tompon'andraikitra tsy handefa dokambarotra intsony'. 
Nohamafisin'ilay sehatra ihany koa fa 'tsy hiseho amin'ny' YouTube izay doka vaovao rehetra mifandray amin'ny 
horonantsary voarara na pejy itodiana. 
 Araka ny voalazan'ny fikambanana mpiaro ny zon'olombelona Viasna 96, misy olona miisa 968 amin'izao fotoana 
izao no[32] voasokajy ho gadra politika ao Belarosia, ary mitombo hatrany izany isa izany. Vokatry ny fanenjehana 
heloka bevava misy antony politika mifandraika amin'ny korontana mitohy taorian'ny fifidianana filoham-pirenena sy 
ny hetsi-panoherana faobe tamin'ny volana Aogositra 2020 ny ankamaroan'ireo nogadraina na notanana. Maro 
amin'ireo no gadra politika malaza, anisan'izany ilay bilaogera sady mpanao gazety Ihar Losik sy Syarhey 
Tsikhanouski, kandid ho filoham-pirenena teo aloha sady vadin'i Tsikhanouskaya, izay vao haingana no nahazo[33] 
sazy an-tranomaizina maharitra. 
Nesorin'i Google ny doka YouTube ahitana ny famotopotorana ireo gadra politika Belarosiana

Allegiant's Turn Toward Boeing Isn't as Dramatic As You Might Think

Jan 10, 2022( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Allegiant and Boeing announced last week that the airline would buy 50 737 MAX aircraft[1] with options for 
another 50. On the surface, this sounds crazy since Allegiant is an Airbus operator that generally prefers to acquire 
used aircraft. But this isn't crazy; it's just a further continuation of Allegiant's strategy to take advantage of good 
opportunities when they arise. 
According to ch-aviation[2], Allegiant today has 35 A319s and 86 A320s in the fleet. The A319s might seem like a 
bad airplane for a low-cost operator, but these are special A319s that have two over-wing exits on each side and 
consequently can hold 156 seats. The A320s come in two flavors 27 of them have 177 seats while the rest are at 
186. Thirteen of the A320s came factory fresh from Airbus while the rest were all second-hand. 
Allegiant likes the A320s, and in fact, on a call last week it said it actually has placeholders in its fleet plan for an 
additional 22 that it expects to pick up on the used market. The A319s, well, it likes to consider those a swing fleet. 
It may very well retire them in 2025, or it might not if there is opportunity. 
As CEO Maury Gallagher explained on that call, Allegiant is planning for a 10 percent growth rate per year through 
the end of the decade, getting the airline into the 250 fleet range. According to Maury, there just isn't a way to get 
enough aircraft on the used market to make that happen. After all, Allegiant won't just take any airplane. It needs 
something that fits the fleet well. 
Enter Boeing, a company that has had a rough go of it for, um, well, for a long time. This year the MAX has proven 
itself as a reliable and safe airplane, and Boeing has sold a decent number of aircraft. But the manufacturer just 
recently lost two high-profile deals to Airbus at Qantas and KLM, both of which operate Boeing narrowbodies today. 
Boeing needed a win, and this was a great opportunity to get it. 
Allegiant will take 30 of the MAX 7 aircraft and 20 of the MAX 8 200 planes which were purpose-built for Ryanair to 
be able to cram more seats into the airframe. The MAX 7 may seem like an odd choice until you realize what 
Allegiant's Turn Toward Boeing Isn't as Dramatic As You Might Think
Allegiant will do with them. The airline is planning for a remarkable 173 seats onboard. Southwest, for comparison, 
is planning for only 150. 
With 173 seats, the economics of that airplane become very good. Of course, it can't beat the seat costs of putting 
200 seats on the MAX 200, but look at this from Allegiant's presentation[3]. 
In this configuration, seat costs per departure are about $10 below what they would be in Southwest's configuration. 
Think about it another way. Including ownership costs, the MAX 7 will be cheaper to run on a per seat basis than 
the A320. That is pretty fantastic. 
This, naturally, means Allegiant got an incredible deal on the airplane, and that is no surprise considering how much 
of a win Boeing needed. From Allegiant's perspective, it could get a cheap, efficient airplane and it could get it soon. 
First deliveries are in June of next year. Even if it could get a good deal on the neo family from Airbus, which it 
probably couldn't, there aren't delivery slots to get Allegiant the airplanes it needs when it needs them. 
What about the A220? That was in the mix, but there are a couple issues. First and probably most important, 
Allegiant wants to be able to go bigger. While an A220-500 might get built, it won't happen soon enough for 
Allegiant's needs. And by the way, putting 173 seats on the MAX 7 makes it easily competitive with the A220 
anyway. The other A220 concern, according to Allegiant, is low spare parts coverage. 
So, with the right ownership costs, the MAX starts to look pretty good to Allegiant. But wait, there's more. Mentioned 
multiple times on the call last week was the engine commonality. Allegiant has CFM engines on its Airbus fleet, and 
it will also have CFM engines on the Boeing fleet. (The A220s is Pratt-powered.) I have little doubt that Boeing sat 
on GE/CFM to help sweeten the pot. Allegiant noted that it will receive 'enhanced' support on its existing engines as 
part of this deal. Just call that the cherry on top of the sundae. 
Still, I know many will have trouble getting over the idea that two fleet types adds complexity and is costly. But it's 
really not when you have fleets this big. Further, Allegiant's unique network strategy makes it even less problematic. 
Allegiant has its big bases in places like Las Vegas and Orlando/Sanford, but it also has small bases scattered 
around the country in places like Des Moines, Grand Rapids, and Knoxville. While it had about a third of its flying 
from those small bases in 2019, that has climbed to nearly half in 2022. And Allegiant thinks of those like mini-
airlines. 
The airplanes and crews start every day in each base and finish their days there as well, sleeping in their own beds. 
This self-contained operation means Allegiant can create Boeing bases and Airbus bases and not have to duplicate 
spare parts, etc in those smaller markets. That's yet another reason Allegiant can do this without much trouble. 
For Allegiant to get all these airplanes for cheap along with engine support on the entire fleet means the airline can 
easily fulfill its growth plan with less hassle. This is a great coup for the airline. It's also a big win for Boeing to finally 
get a sale of the MAX at one of the US ULCCs, so everyone should be happy.

Jan 06, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week,Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] dominated headlines as it entered into an agreement with The 
Boeing Company BA[2] to buy 50 new 737 MAX jets. Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[3] 
also grabbed headlines owing to the 14.7% year-over-year increase in its December traffic as air-travel demand 
improves in the region. 
Despite the omicron variant of COVID-19 ravaging Europe, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] December traffic surged 
400% year over year. In the United States, the omicron variant is also creating havoc and ruining holiday travel 
plans. With crew members being affected in large numbers, airlines are grappling with staffing crisis. To combat the 
crisis, United Airlines UAL[5] is reportedly[6] offering triple pay to its pilots who pick up extra trips in January. 
Read the last Airline stock Roundup here[7]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Omicron-related staffing shortage 
coupled with bad weather conditions in parts of the United States have caused multiple flight cancellations in the 
United States since the Christmas Eve. Amid such a bleak scenario, United Airlines reached an agreement with its 
pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots Association, offering pilots higher pay to cover open trips. Pilots were offered three-
and-a-half times their pay for flying open trips between Dec 30 and Jan 3. Additionally, they are being offered thrice 
their pay for picking up trips between Jan 4 and Jan 29[8]. 
UAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) 
stocks here[9]. 
2. With air-travel demand improving, courtesy of increased vaccination, December traffic surged at Ryanair to 9.5 
million from 1.9 million in December 2020. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in December 
2021 was 81% compared with 73% in December 2020. 
3. At Gol Linhas, December 2021 traffic rose 14.7% year over year. Capacity, measured in available seat 
kilometers, increased 13.4% year over year to 3.5 billion last month. Since traffic growth was more than capacity 
expansion, load factor improved 0.9 percentage points (p.p) to 81.9% last month. With steady improvement in travel 
demand, traffic climbed 10% year over year in 2021. In response to this uptick, Gol Linhas expanded its capacity 
7.5% in the year just went by. Load factor ascended 1.9 p.p to 82% in 2021. 
4. To modernize and expand its fleet, Allegiant Travel placed an order to Boeing for purchasing 50 new 737 MAX 
aircraft. Per the deal, Allegiant will buy the 737-7 and 737-8-200 models. The agreement allows ALGT to replace 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Boing 737MAX Order, GOL 's Rosy Traffic Post & More
the planes scheduled to retire while expanding the fleet simultaneously as it aims to achieve the projected 10% plus 
annual growth rate. 
Additionally, ALGT has options to purchase 50 additional aircraft. Allegiant intends to take delivery of an initial 
group of planes in 2023, with the remaining scheduled for 2024 and 2025. The deal with Boeing marks a shift in 
strategy for ALGT as far as its fleet is concerned. This is because it currently operates an all-airbus fleet. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

The table above shows that majority of the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week. However, the 
gains were muted in nature causing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to increase marginally to $82.62. Over the past 
six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 15.1%. What's Next in the Airline Space? December 
traffic reports from some carriers are expected in the coming days.

 We are seeing conflicting trends in the number of traffic from two of Europe's biggest low-cost airlines,Ryanair[1] 
and Wizz Air[2]. While the Central Eastern European carrier reports recovery of passenger numbers for December, 
its Irish competitor saw a decline to the lowest level since July which it blames on the Omicron effect. Traffic 
numbers Ryanair and Wizz going down and up. 
 Ryanair carried 9.5 million passengers in December compared to 10.2 million in November and even 11.3 million in 
October. This was the highest level in the current FY22, which runs from April to April. During the first nine months, 
Ryanair and its subsidiaries Malta Air and Buzz carried 70.1 million passengers, of which 62 million between July 
and December. By comparison: in the first nine months of FY21, Ryanair carried 25.1 million passengers. 
 The load factor for December was 81 percent, which is back to the September level after two months of 84 and 86 
percent in October and November. The number of flights in December was 62.000, only 300 down in November but 
much lower than the 71.500 in October. 
 Ryanair said on December 22 that it has lowered its guidance for December from ten to eleven million passengers 
to nine to 9.5 million, ending up at the higher end of its forecast. Its final quarter between January and the end of 
March will likely see a significant impact of Omicron as bookings are expected to end up much lower. Ryanair has 
cut its capacity for the quarter by 33 percent and hopes to carry at least some 25 to 30 million passengers to end 
FY22 slightly under 100 million passengers. 
 https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wizz-air-
a321235dad1be0da498b945725174da78cac_180b0407.jpg?ssl=1 
 At Wizz Air, we are seeing a different trend in traffic numbers. The carrier reported 2.6 million passengers in 
December, up from 2.1 million in November. However, Wizz experienced a significant drop in November from 2.9 
million passengers in October as well as September as it suffered from rising Covid infections in Eastern Europe. 
Mind you this was still the Delta variant. As with Ryanair, August was the best month for Wizz at 3.6 million 
passengers. At some half a million passengers, the drop between August and September was almost identical with 
both airlines. 
 Like that of Ryanair, Wizz Air's financial year FY21/22 spans from April to April. During the first nine months, it 
carried 20.2 million passengers compared to 8.6 million in the same period of FY20/21. For the rolling twelve 
months, Wizz said it carried 21.7 million passengers, up from 16.8 million for January-December 2020. If we 
Traffic numbers Ryanair and Wizz going down and up
translate Ryanair's numbers into a rolling year, it ended 2021 with 72.4 million passengers carried compared to 51,9 
million in 2020. 
 Wizz's load factor for December was 75.4 percent and 75.2 percent for the twelve months period. Whereas 
Ryanair doesn't provide monthly figures of its capacity, Wizz reports that capacity in December was 3.5 million 
seats or 194.6 percent higher than December 2020. Capacity for the rolling year was 28.9 million seats, +29.6 
million. 
 So far, no other airlines have reported traffic numbers for December.easyjet[3] hasn't published any data since 
September when it closed its FY21. Back then, the UK low-cost airline carried 4.5 million passengers and 5.1 
million in August. Lufthansa Group, Air France-KLM, and International Airlines Group (IAG) have stopped publishing 
monthly traffic data some time ago and only announce quarterly results. 
 So while Ryanair's traffic numbers have gone down and those of Wizz Air up, it is likely that the Omicron effect will 
push traffic further down in the coming quarter. This seems to confirm that 2022 will continue to be another 
rollercoaster year for Europe's air travel.

Allegiant selects MAX but partly keeps A320ceo fleet
Allegiant selects MAX but partly keeps A320ceo fleet

 Boeing[1]and Allegiant Air[2] were tightlipped yesterday, but today they have confirmed reports that the airline has 
selected the MAX for its fleet renewal and growth strategy. Allegiant has placed a firm order for fifty MAX 7s and 8-
200s for delivery in 2023, with purchase rights for another fifty for delivery in 2024-2025, it said on January 5. 
Allegiant selects MAX but partly keeps A320ceo fleet. 
 The order is a welcome start of the new year to Boeing, which lost out to Airbus in December when Qantas[3], 
KLM[4], Transavia, and Transavia France selected the A220 and A320neo/A321XLR. This time it's Airbus that is 
losing an order, as Allegiant has been an all-Airbus operator since retiring its McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s and 
Boeing 757 some years ago. 
 Allegiant Air currently has a fleet of 108 A319s and A320s, the former with an average age of 16.5 years and the 
latter of fourteen years. They have flown before with a wide selection of airlines that include easyjet, Iberia, Peach, 
or Cebu. 
 The MAX will offer the ultra-low-cost airline with more fuel-efficient and economical aircraft, with the MAX 7 and its 
172 seat single-class configuration offering more capacity than the A319ceo with its 156 seats. It gives the carrier 
the flexibility to introduce new routes that need to prove their worth, adding capacity with the 210-seat MAX 8-200 
that entered service with Ryanair and its subsidiaries Buzz and Malta Air last year. The Irish low-cost operates 
theMAX 8200[5] with 197 seats. The high-density version recently also won orders from Indian start-upAkasa Air[6] 
and lessor777 Partners.[7] 
 https://i1.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/FFoL2HwWQA0l4qh.jpg?ssl=1 
 Allegiant will likely phase out all Airbus[8] A319ceo's, like this one, but will keep an A320ceo fleet and will even add 
more used aircraft. (Allegiant Air) 
 While Airbus has lost an order for the A320neo-family, it isn't losing Allegiant Air as an entire customer. The carrier 
makes clear that it plans to operate the MAX alongside its A320ceo-family for some time to come, adding even 
more A320ceo's when they become available. This is defying the golden rule of low-cost that you need a single-
type fleet if you want to maximize your costs advantage. Allegiant used to follow this rule by sourcing used 
A320ceo-family aircraft to maintain lower fixed costs. 'However, the pandemic recovery cycle has brought to 
Allegiant unique opportunities to acquire new equipment, including this aircraft-family solution, which will add 
significant economic and operational benefits for years to come', the carrier says in apress release.[9] 
Allegiant selects MAX but partly keeps A320ceo fleet
Strategy continues to center around used aircraft 
Chairman and CEO Maurice J. Gallagher says: 'Our approach to the fleet has always been opportunistic, and this 
exciting transaction with Boeing[10] is no exception. While the heart of our strategy continues to center on 
previously-owned aircraft, the infusion of up to 100 direct-from-the-manufacturer 737s will bring numerous benefits 
for the future - including flexibility for capacity growth and aircraft retirements, significant environmental benefits, 
and modern configuration and cabin features our customers will appreciate.' 
 The mixed Boeing and Airbus fleet will allow Allegiant Air to retire its oldest A319ceo's and A320ceo's while adding 
capacity and realizing the ten percent-plus annual growth rate which is part of its long-term strategy. It will be 
looking out for opportunities to source used A320ceo's when they come available. 
MAX has the strongest position in North and South America 
Stan Deal, Boeing Commercial Airplanes President, and CEO, is most happy with the Allegiant order: 'This deal 
further validates the economics of the 737 MAX family in the ULCC market and we're excited to stand alongside 
Allegiant as they integrate these new airplanes into their fleet.' 
 The latest deal with Allegiant Air seems to confirm a trend that the Boeing MAX is selling especially well in North 
and South America while losing market share elsewhere, notably in Europe. Except for Delta Airlines, the MAX has 
been bought by legacy carriers like American, United, WestJet, and Air Canada, while also forming the backbone of 
the fleets of Southwest and Alaska Airlines. In Latin and South America, the MAX has been the preferred aircraft 
with Aeromexico and GOL. Delta has opted for the A320neo-family, as have JetBlue, Frontier, and Spirit. United will 
get the A321XLR later on, while JetBlue, Breeze, and Air Canada also operate the A220. 
 In Europe, Boeing over the past two decades has steadily lost market share to Airbus in the medium-haul segment 
with orders from Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia, SAS, or airBaltic. Boeing lost orders to 
Airbus from ITA Airways and Jet 2 last year, while the Letter of Intent from International Airlines Group (IAG) for 200 
MAX seems off the table. After the 'defection' of KLM and the two Transavia's, another major carrier has jumped 
ship. It leaves the MAX in service only with Ryanair, TUI Fly, Norwegian, Icelandair, and in the near future Flyr.

 Despite the raging omicron COVID variant, the battered aviation industry is cautiously optimistic about the new 
year. The year 2022 could be marked by a host of firsts and lasts for the industry.Few industries have been hit 
harder by the pandemic than aviation. But just when its fortunes were beginning to turn, it is having to contend with 
a new COVID-19 variant and ensuing travel restrictions. 
For some weeks during the summer holidays last year, air traffic was almost back at pre-pandemic levels, in rare 
cases even higher. By mid-December, the number of flights in European skies had reached about three quarters of 
the level seen during the same time in 2019 with low-cost carrier Ryanair leading the way. 
Ryanair, the market leader, was the only airline that clocked more flights, witnessing a 12% increase from 2019. 
Lufthansa and Air France each operated 21% fewer flights. British Airways fared even worse with the number of 
flights down by 35%. 
"From mid-January into February, we see a sharp decline in bookings," Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in a 
Christmas interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper. "As a result, during the winter 
schedule, we will have to cancel some 33,000 flights or 10% in our group offering." 
Ryanair, which had dared to flood the market with capacity, has been struck even harder by the fresh restrictions. 
and now expects just 6-7 million passengers, down from the 10 million it projected earlier. 
Better times ahead 
The situation isn't any better globally — particularly in Asia. China largely remains off limits to foreign visitors as has 
been the case since the outbreak of the pandemic. Other markets like Thailand or Singapore, which were slowly 
easing restrictions for foreign travelers, have now taken a step backwards. New Zealand has postponed its 
reopening plans amid the omicron scare. 
Still, the aviation industry remains cautiously optimistic about its prospects this year. German flag carrier 
Lufthansawants to get back to making profits after having repaid its state debt earlier than planned. 
Aviation industry magazine Airline Business boldly predicts: "There are still solid grounds for believing 2022 can be 
significantly better than 2021 was for the airline industry, that is, once the omicron wave subsides." 
Hybrid hydrogen-electric aircraft 
Sustainability — which has been endorsed as a key goal by the aviation industry during the pandemic — will remain 
high on the agenda in 2022. First hybrid hydrogen-electric aircraft are due to take to the air this year, including the 
prototype of a 19-seater German-built Dornier 228, converted by British company ZeroAvia, as the industry strives 
to become climate-neutral by 2050. 
Hydrogen-electric jets and restructuring: Aviation industry's 2022 plans
As part of its go-green drive, the industry is pinning its hopes on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a stopgap before 
aircraft can be powered by new energy sources. But SAF remains extremely costly for airlines and as a result very 
little of it is being produced. There are calls for governments to incentivize SAF production, including by imposing 
quotas on how much SAF must be blended with conventional jet fuel kerosene. 
The industry's green push is facing another immediate challenge, as highlighted by Lufthansa's Spohr in his 
interview. 
"We have to operate 18,000 extra and unnecessary flights, just to secure our takeoff and landing slots," which he 
said was at odds with the European Union's climate goals. 
In 2020, the European Commission had suspended the strict rule, which said an airline caould only keep its slots 
when it used at least 80% of them. Currently, an airline must use 50% of the slots with the figure planned to be 
raised to 64% from late March. While low-cost carriers would love to take over many of the empty slots much to the 
delight of underused airports, the EU will have to find a just and flexible allocation system that would minimize 
senseless empty flights at the same time. 
Russian rival 
There are some interesting milestones coming up for the aviation industry in 2022. The Russian twin-engine airliner, 
Irkut MC-21, has just been certified by authorities for passenger service. Even though the jet has yet to prove its 
mettle in the airline market, it will be competing for orders with decades-old bestsellers Airbus A320 and Boeing 
737. 
This spring, there will be the first flight of an interesting addition to the Airbus family at its factory in Hamburg-
Finkenwerder: the A321XLR. The airplane can carry between 180 and 220 passengers over distances of up to 
8,700 km (5,406 miles), thanks to its extra fuel tanks- It comes at the unit cost of a smaller medium-haul airliner. 
The low-flying cost means the aircraft would be economically viable to operate nonstop intercontinental routes even 
from secondary airports. The director of Nuremberg airport in Germany, for example, recently signaled his interest 
in direct flights to the US East Coast using the new A321XLR. 
This emerging trend of market fragmentation with ever more passengers able to reach their destinations nonstop, 
avoiding big hub airports, was one of the factors contributing to the demise of Airbus's A380s. 
In early 2022, after over 50 years, the production of the legendary Boeing jumbo jet, the Boeing 747, will also end, 
due to a lack of demand for its passenger version. However, the aircraft will retire with a unique record to its name; 
it's the only airliner to have remained in production for over half a century.

Dec 29, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Omicron-induced staff crunch and woeful weather prompted U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[1] and United 
Airlines UAL[2] to cancel multiple flights, thereby hampering travel plans of many passengers over the Christmas 
holiday weekend. 
Again due to travel restrictions triggered by the omicron variant, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] trimmed its traffic 
forecast for fiscal 2022. JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] decided to continue operating on the New York JFK-London 
Heathrow route through October next year. 
JetBlue also recently grabbed headlines following its expansion update on its Northeast Alliance with American 
Airlines AAL[5]. This story was covered in detail in the previous week's roundup[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 
1. Ryanair now anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic count to be little less than 100 million passengers compared with the 
previous expectation of just above 100 million. Net loss is expected in the range of €250-€450 million compared 
with the previously guided range of €100-€200 million. RYAAY lowered its December traffic forecast to 9-9.5 million 
passengers from 10-11 million expected earlier due to the effects of government travel restrictions, especially 
France and Germany's ban on UK travelers and the suspension of the EU flights to/from Morocco. The airline 
slashed its planned January schedule by 33%. It now expects January traffic to be 6-7 million compared with 10 
million anticipated previously[7]. RYAAY currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. JetBlue extended its daily transatlantic flights between New York JFK) and London Heathrow Airport through 
October 2022 after securing the required take-off and landing slots. The flights launched on Aug 12 2021 are now 
scheduled to run daily until Oct 31, 2022. Before the unveiling of this transatlantic route, travelers had to choose 
from limited flight options with costly tickets between JFK and LHR, especially in the premium travel segment. Since 
launching the route, JetBlue has reduced premium fares by up to 50%. JetBlue's tickets are now up for sale through 
Oct 31, 2022[9]. 
3. Holiday travel was disrupted as the U.S. airlines were forced to cancel multiple flights due to a combination of 
omicron-led manpower crunch and unfavorable weather conditions. For example, United Airlines cancelled more 
than 100 Christmas Eve flights[10]. UAL's senior vice president of flight operations, Bryan Quigley, reportedly[11] 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Dim FY22 Traffic View, Flight Cancellations & More
wrote in a message to the airline's pilots, 'Our current pilot Covid-19 case count is on the rise.' Quigley added, 
'Pilots who have developed symptoms are also in quarantine and we have a high number of pilots on the sick list.' 
Delta also suffered the same issue. Having already called off several flights since the Christmas Eve, DAL canceled 
some more on Monday Dec 27. 
4 In a major boost to airline stocks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced to five days from 10 
the recommended isolation period for the Americans infected with COVID-19. In case the patient is asymptomatic, 
he/she should wear a mask (when around others) for five more days after leaving the isolation zone. Per CDC's 
press release[12], the move to shorten the isolation phase was prompted by the fact that the transmission of SARS-
CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) mostly occurs 1-2 days prior to the onset of symptoms and 2-3 days following the 
same. CDC's decision is also a boon for the airlines as it is likely to go a long way in tackling the staffing scarcity, 
which imposed mass flight cancellations over the Christmas weekend. Performance The following table shows the 
price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week. However, the gains 
were muted in nature causing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to increase marginally to $83.63. Over the past six 
months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 15.6%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Further updates 
on the impact of staff shortage and foul weather on aviation operations are expected in the coming days.

Omicron effect becomes evident in air travel

Dec 24, 2021( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 With the infectious Omicron variant present in more and more countries and spreading quickly, airlines are 
beginning to see the effects of this mutation on their business. A few airlines have announced a drastic reduction in 
capacity for the coming months, while short-term, cancelations are disrupting travel plans during the Christmas 
holiday season. Omicron effect becomes evident in air travel. 
 With more and more staff unavailable because they have been diagnosed with Omicron and have to stay in 
quarantine, airlines like United Airlines[1], Delta Airlines[2], andLufthansa[3] have been forced to cancel flights 
today on December 24. United reportedly has canceled some 120 flights, Delta around ninety, Alaska Airlines 
around twenty, and Lufthansa around six long-haul flights over the Christmas weekend. 
 These are the short-term effects of Omicron, but in the medium-term, the virus is making the public unsure of 
flying. Irish low-cost airlineRyanair[4] said on December 23 that it will reduce capacity in January by 33 percent and 
expects to fly six to seven million passengers instead of the earlier anticipated ten million. The ban of UK flights into 
Germany and France since last weekend plus the suspension of all EU flights to Morocco has already affected 
Ryanair's December traffic by one to 1.5 million passengers. Ryanair has changed its guidance for the current 
financial year, expecting a net loss of €250 to €450 million now compared to between €100 to €200 million in its 
previous guidance. 
 Lufthansa Group too is seeing a sharp decline in bookings for January and February and has responded by cutting 
its schedule for the two months by 33.000 flights, or ten percent of total flights said CEO Carsten Spohr. He said 
that he could have made even deeper cuts but is forced to operate flights to prevent losing slots under the slot rule 
from the European Commission. Under this rule, airlines are required to operate fifty percent of their flights if they 
want to keep their historical rights at airports. 
 Earlier this month,British Airways[5] flight schedule showed that it would cancel over 2.100 flights until March. 
ANA[6]has adjusted its January-March international schedule by some 3.000 flights. At the same time, the airline - 
like other ones - announced their January sales, with BA offering tickets to some 100 destinations at discount 
prices. On Boxing Day, Ryanair will start offering ten million seats for €29.99 for the April-September period. This 
will unquestionably affect its financial results, as has happened in the past year after Ryanair tried to stimulate 
demand by dumping ticket prices. 
Omicron effect becomes evident in air travel
 From recent research in the UK, Denmark, and South Africa, the effects of Omicron seem to be more favorable 
than that of the Delta variant, but the higher infection rates and greater change of contamination still could cause 
serious capacity problems in hospitals and health systems. Earlier in December, IATA said that the airline industry 
wasnot to blame for the spreading of Omicron.[7]

Dec 23, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has reduced its fiscal 2022 guidance as Omicron fears and travel restrictions across 
Europe have weakened close-in Christmas & New Year bookings. 
RYAAY now anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic to be little less than 100 million passengers compared with the previous 
expectation of just above 100 million. Net loss is expected to be in the range of €250-€450 million compared with 
the previously guided range of €100-€200 million. 
Ryanair has lowered its December traffic forecast to 9-9.5 million passengers from 10-11 million expected earlier. 
The traffic forecast has been lowered due to the effects of government travel restrictions, especially France and 
Germany's ban on UK travelers and the suspension of EU flights to/from Morocco. The airline has slashed its 
planned January schedule capacity by 33%. It now expects January traffic to be 6-7 million from 10 million expected 
previously. RYAAY is yet to decide on schedule cutbacks for February and March 2022. Ryanair Holdings PLC

Dec 22, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] boosted its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly owing to strong 
passenger demand during the holidays and waning omicron-related fears. Also, on the back of improved air-travel 
demand in the United States, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] posted a substantial year-over-year increase in 
scheduled traffic for November 2021.Further, with COVID-19's omicron variant ravaging Europe, particularly the UK 
and Ireland, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[3] CEO Michael O'Leary expects the carrier's capacity for the current and 
the next month to be dented. 
An expansion-related update on the Northeast Alliance betweenAmerican Airlines AAL[4] and JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[5] was available in the past week. We note that the partnershipis under scrutiny over concerns related to 
reducing competition and jacking up air fares.  
JetBlue also recently grabbed headlines following its decision to expand its codeshare partnership with the Irish 
carrier Aer Lingus. This story was covered in detail in the previous week's roundup[6]. Recap of the Past Week's 
Big Events 1 Per an SEC filing, Delta expects to generate an adjusted pre-tax profit of approximately $200 million in 
the December quarter. During the third-quarter 2021 earnings release in October, the airline had warned that rising 
fuel prices might put pressure on its ability to generate profits in the fourth quarter. DAL had then expected to incur 
a moderate loss in the December quarter. 
Delta expects adjusted total revenues (excluding third-party refinery sales) to be 74% recovered in the fourth 
quarter compared with the same-period level in 2019. Previously, the airline had expected to generate total 
revenues in the low 70s (in percentage terms) compared with the 2019 level. The improved outlook is owing to 
better-than-anticipated total revenue per available seat mile and positive passenger revenue per available seat mile 
(compared with the 2019 reading) on account of strong travel demand during the holidays. Non-fuel unit costs are 
estimated to increase approximately 7% in the December quarter from the 2019 level. The same is compared with 
the previous guidance of an increase in the 6-8% range. Fuel price per gallon (adjusted) is predicted to be $2.05-
$2.15 for the fourth quarter compared with the previously guided range of $2.25-$2.40. Total capacity is still 
expected to be 80% of the 2019 level[7]. Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].

2. Under the alliance with JetBlue, American Airlines is expanding its global footprint in 2022, with new nonstop 
services between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Doha's (Qatar) Hamad International 
Airport. From LaGuardia airport, the carrier added routes to Houston, TX; Kansas City, MO; Oklahoma City, OK and 
Omaha, NE. 
From Boston, American Airlines announced new nonstop services to Halifax, Nova Scotia; Louisville, KY; Memphis, 
TN; Pensacola, FL; and Traverse City, MI. These new flights from Boston add to the carrier's recently announced 
routes to Columbus, OH; Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Wilmington, N.C. and Toronto, Canada. From LaGuardia 
airport, JetBlue will begin a service to Portland, ME in 2022[9]. 
3. At Allegiant, scheduled traffic for November 2021 surged 78.8% from the November 2020 levels. Capacity for 
scheduled service increased 32.8% from the November 2020 reading. With the traffic surge outweighing capacity 
expansion, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in November expanded 20 points to 77.6% from the

 Work to build Teesside International Airport's new Sky Bar, viewing platform and office space has now begun, as 
part of the next phase of the airport's transformation. 
 Both the landside Sky Bar and at-height viewing platform will be located in what is currently the ageing office space 
next to the security area. 
 The 1,360 sq m of office space being created will consist of a new steel frame extension and replace the old, 
disused, and dilapidated buffet restaurant area and offices transforming it into a two-floor bar, offering a modern 
and flexible space for business. 
 From today, the current viewing platform, drop-off point, and short-stay car park are closed to the public so that 
work can begin. The drop-off/short-stay will temporarily move to the main car park but the usual parking charges for 
these services will continue to apply. 
The scheme of works will start in January with the removal of cladding from the terminal building and demolition of 
external walls by a former courtyard. From February, the setting of foundations and the erection of the new steel 
frame extension and roof will begin. The viewing platform is due to be completed and open by May. 
 Work will be carried out by local firms Wharton Construction, 186 Property Solutions and ADL Developments, 
which have all previously been part of the terminal's 'multi million-pound redevelopment'. 
 Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'This latest work will see a fantastic new area created where people 
can kick back, relax and enjoy the best views in the country of aircraft taking off and landing. 
 '2022 will be the airport's busiest summer in years, with Ryanair committed to the same popular destinations it 
brought to us this year. It will also see the return of TUI, the world's leading holiday company, after nine years, so 
people can be assured there'll be plenty to see.'

Ryanair boss says UK response to Omicron shaped by 'idiots'
Ryanair boss says UK response to Omicron shaped by 'idiots'

Dec 17, 2021( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, has said the UK government's response to the Omicron Covid variant has 
been shaped by 'panic' and 'idiots', blaming travel restrictions for a million fewer passengers than forecast flying on 
his airline this month. 
The chief executive of Europe's biggest carrier contrasted the recent policies implemented in the UK demanding 
PCR tests for all arrivals with EU states where most fully vaccinated people can travel more freely. 
 Speaking from Dublin to the Guardian on Wednesday, he said: 'The panic is largely confined to the UK and Ireland. 
Across the continent there's been a much more reasoned approach.' 
 While Ryanair is offering fares of as little as 5 one way, O'Leary said 'price incentives are not going to make any 
difference' around Christmas, which he said was well-booked, but the airline would fly about 10 million people this 
month instead of the forecast 11 million, and would cut about 10% of its capacity in January. 
 He said: 'Where it's really hit us has been the early weeks of December, bookings in and out of Ireland and the UK 
The rest of the continent is still travelling for business and for leisure.' 
 O'Leary said the UK economy was suffering from 'piss-poor political leadership', adding: 'What deters booking is 
the whole uncertainty - this idea that if I travel abroad if the government changes the rules in 24 hours I could be 
stranded, even if Covid-free and vaccinated Travel only exists on a degree of confidence. 
 'People in the UK recognise that the government there are idiots. You wouldn't rely on [Boris] Johnson or Grant 
Shapps, or Dominic Raab who can't add or subtract - would you want your journey dependent on the intervention of 
those idiots? The answer is no.' 
 Before the mounting medical concern over Omicron, O'Leary declared: 'What's likely to happen is that we all get to 
Christmas, everybody calms down, the politicians fuck off for two weeks and everything settles down again. We'll 
arrive back in January and realise, as South Africa has been telling us for four weeks, it is not going to flood your 
hospitals.' 
 O'Leary said the airline had 'no issues' in Europe: 'They are all seeing an increase in case numbers but they're not 
having the same kind of 24-hour panic. I don't know if it is Johnson trying to cover his mismanagement of the 
Downing Street party shambles, who knows.' 
Ryanair boss says UK response to Omicron shaped by 'idiots'
 A Ryanair tweet that went viral sparked controversy this week. O'Leary said he had not seen it before publication, 
but added: 'I was very proud of it - I went over first thing yesterday [to the social media team] to say well done, let's 
do more of them.' 
 O'Leary offered some support for the prime minister by saying he was in favour of vaccine passports for travel, 
work and even shopping: 'We recognise your right to a choice [to not be vaccinated], but if you want to be some 
independent-minded idiot, sit at home. Why should people working in hospitals treat you and put themselves at 
risk?' 
 Ryanair will delist from the London Stock Exchange on Friday to deter UK shareholders, as it attempts to comply 
with EU ownership rules. O'Leary said it was 'an inevitability post Brexit', adding: 'Brexit has been a monstrous 
economic disaster delivered to you by those idiots Even the great Brexiteers, [Simon] Wolfson in Next, Tim Nice-
but-Dim Martin [of Wetherspoons] now want visas [for their staff].' 
 Meanwhile, O'Leary said Ryanair would be engaged in further legal battles this year with online travel agencies. He 
claimed customers were being overcharged by third-party websites for fares, seat selection and baggage when they 
would be better protected booking direct: 'They can only do it on an unsuspecting public who click on these paid-for 
ads on Google search, which take them off into online travel agencies. 
 'If it was an airline doing this egregious overcharging they'd be jumped on by consumer protection agencies. It's no 
skin off our nose - we still get the booking, we still get the money. But our passengers are being ripped off.' 
 O'Leary said the practice had been 'part of the issue' with complaints over slow refunds when flights were 
cancelled during Covid, leaving Ryanair unable to automatically alert on flight changes or refund customers 
because 'the money would end in the belly' of the online agencies. He estimated about 10-15% of passengers were 
booking through third parties.

 This Week's Featured Link 
 American Airlines Announces Senior Leadership Team[1] - American Newsroom Here it is, the official leadership 
team under new American CEO Robert Isom and it's what you'd expect it to look like if you were hoping for 
continuity. Elise Eberwein will retire and her job is split between Ron DeFeo and Cole Brown. Steve Johnson looks 
like he gets to do special projects while two of his lieutenants move up to split his old job. Derek Kerr keeps CFO 
and moves to Vice Chair. The only surprise here is that Vasu Raja moves up from Chief Revenue Officer to Chief 
Commercial Officer, taking over sales and marketing that had fallen under Alison Taylor. Alison now reports to 
Vasu, so that feels like a demotion to me. 
 Tweet of the Week 
Oh, Ryanair. Never change.

 Capital Markets Day[2] - Delta Delta had its investor day and you can read through the full powerpoint deck to get a

The Loss of My Favorite Travel Partner Forever[3] - AirlineReporter For those who haven't heard, AirlineReporter 
founder David Parker Brown lost his wife this summer to cancer. This is a nice tribute to their shared love of travel. 
The box of unused pins good luck not getting choked up when you get to that point. I think we need volunteers to 
start going on trips with David, because I'm pretty sure Brittany would want those pins put to good use.

 With the highly contagious omicron variant of COVID-19 sweeping across Europe and causing panic, mainly in the 
UK and Ireland, Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] anticipates its current and next month's capacity to take a 
massive beating. 
Per a Reuters report[2], chief executive Michael O'Leary told the Guardian newspaper that the carrier will carry 
roughly 10% less passengers in December 2021 and January 2022. According to O'Leary, Ryanair intends to fly 
about 10 million people in the final month of 2021 (1 million less than the estimated figure). Moreover, RYAAY aims 
to trim its January schedule by roughly 10%. 
On a brighter note, O'Leary said that seats for the upcoming Christmas were 'well-booked'. He further added that 
the omicron-led panic was primarily restricted to the UK and Ireland while 'the rest of the continent is still travelling 
for business and for leisure". Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
Here are some better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation [4]sector: 
Schneider National SNDR[5] sports a Zacks Rank #1, presently. SNDR's earnings outperformed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 21%. 
Shares of Schneider National have rallied more than 25% so far this year. SNDR gets a boost from its strong 
Intermodal and Logistics units. The Intermodal segment is benefiting from yield management and increased 
volumes. The Logistics unit is thriving on the back of favorable market conditions and other factors. 
ArcBest Corporation ARCB[6] flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1, currently. ARCB's earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 27.4%. 
Shares of ArcBest have surged more than 100% so far this year. Improving freight conditions in the United States 
bode well for ARCB. Solid customer demand and higher market rates are driving growth at ARCB. 
Expeditors International of Washington EXPD[7] carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), presently. EXPD has a stellar 
earnings surprise history. Its bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four 
quarters, the average being 29.1%. 
Shares of Expeditors have appreciated 42% so far this year. Increased airfreight revenues aid EXPD in this 
coronavirus-ravaged scenario. The metric soared approximately 54% year over year in the first nine months of 
2021. We are also encouraged by EXPD's measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

 British Airways[1]will launch operations of its new London Gatwick-based short-haul subsidiary BA Euroflyer on 
March 29. The airline has announced 35 destinations that it will serve and has opened bookings today, December 
14. BA starts selling tickets for its EuroFlyer Gatwick subsidiary. 
 BA CEO Sean Doyle revealed in August that it planned to set up a new short-haul subsidiary at Gatwick to 
compete with its low-cost rivals Ryanair and easyjet. Easyjet has a strong presence at Gatwick and plans to expand 
this coming summer, it recently confirmed during its full-year results presentation. BA lost market share at London's 
second airport when it suspended services at the start of the first Covid crisis in March 2020. 
 British Airways' new airline will operate under the same brand, but as BA EuroFlyer will be a stand-alone airline 
with its own lower-cost business model that mirrors that of BA CityFlyer at London City Airport. When BA unveiled 
its plan in August, it met strong opposition from cabin crew unions. Pilot union BALPA cautiously welcomed the plan 
to 'create a number of much needed new pilot jobs. BALPA and BA are in the final stages of negotiations over the 
revised pay and conditions for Gatwick-based BA pilots and we hope to bring these talks to a conclusion shortly.' 
 In a ballot in early October, 82 percent of the responding pilots supported the low-cost initiative, after which BALPA 
union signed an agreement with BA. In early November, the airline reached an agreement with Unite, which 
represents some 10.000 cabin crew. Unite initially strongly opposed what it called inferior'' terms and conditions of 
the new airline. As a result of the Covid crisis, BA has slashed 10.000 jobs including 4.700 cabin crew members. In 
recent months, BA has started rehiring some 3.000 again. Parent International Airline Group (IAG) said early 
November it was positive about reaching consensus [2]with the unions. 
AOC not expected until next autumn 
BA Euroflyer still has to receive its Airline Operator Certificate (AOC), which isn't expected until autumn 2022. 
Therefore, BA's mainline airline will operate the first flights with three Airbus[3] A320s, expanding the fleet to 
eighteen aircraft by the end of May. 
 The airline has started selling tickets today at 39 to 35 destinations. On March 29, it will operate the first services to 
Amsterdam, Sevilla, Verona, Larnaca, Paphos, and Tenerife. On the 30th, Malta, Arrecife, and Faro will follow. 
March 31 will see Catania, Malaga, Marrakech, and Nice added to the schedule, Alicante on April 1, Antalya and 
Las Palmas on April 2, Bari on April 3, Dubrovnik and Turin on April 4, with another sixteen destinations to follow 
until May 4. These include Berlin, Milan, and Athens but also sunny destinations like Santorini and Thessaloniki. BA 
BA starts selling tickets for its Euroflyer Gatwick subsidiary
said the airline offers the same 'high level of service' and 'generous baggage allowance' as the mother airline and 
lounge access to frequent flyers. 
 In a media statement, Sean Doyle says: 'Today is a landmark moment for British Airways. The creation of a new 
British Airways short-haul organization means Gatwick customers will benefit from access to a premium service 
from the UK's flag carrier at competitive prices. We are looking forward to bringing a short-haul network back to 
Gatwick, with a fantastic flying team in place, to serve our customers from London's second hub airport, which we 
feel sure will be a success.'

 In the past week, United Airlines UAL[1] operated the first ever commercial flight using 100% sustainable aviation 
fuel (SAF) in one of its two engines. American Airlines AAL[2] grabbed headlines as its CEO Doug Parker since 
2013 announced his decision to step down on Mar 31, 2022. Allegiant Travel Company's ALGT[3] partnership with 
Mexican ultra-low-cost carrier Viva Aerobus also invited attention in the past week. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Gol Linhas GOL[5] posted upbeat traffic statistics for November as air-travel 
demand continues to improve, courtesy of increased vaccinations. Ryanair is looking to expand its network, 
courtesy of increased demand despite the omicron scare. In line with this objective, RYAAY announced plans to 
open a new base in Madeira, Portugal during summer 2022. The story was covered in detail in the previous week's 
roundup[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. At American Airlines, Parker will be replaced as CEO by its current 
president Robert Isom. Isom has been serving as the carrier's president since 2016. He is hugely experienced in 
the airline industry, reflected in his leadership expertise across various fields like finance, operations, planning, 
marketing, sales, alliances, pricing and revenue management. With air-travel demand on the mend from the 
pandemic-led pits witnessed last year, American Airlines will be hoping that a veteran like Isom will be able to 
leverage the upbeat scenario and guide AAL in its quest for achieving more growth[7]. 
American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. In line with its efforts to decarbonize the airline industry in the United States, United Airlines flew an aircraft full of 
passengers using only SAF in one of its two engines. The fuel was supplied by World Energy, North America's only 
commercial biofuel producer. The plane took off from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and landed at 
Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport on Dec 1. For future flights, UAL agreed to buy 1.5 billion gallons of 
SAF from Alder Fuels, which is enough to fly 57 million passengers. UAL can also buy up to 900 million gallons of 
additional SAF from Fulcrum BioEnergy[9]. 
3 By virtue of its agreement with Viva Aerobus, Allegiant intends to offer cheaper non-stop leisure travel between 
the United States and Mexico from the first quarter of 2023, post regulatory approval. The alliance is not only the 
first such venture for Allegiant and Viva Aerobus, but is also the first-of-its-kind in the airline industry between two 
ultra-low-cost carriers. The carriers submitted a joint application to the US Department of Transportation requesting 
Airline Stock Roundup: AAL 's New CEO, UAL 's Environmentally-Friendly Move & More
approval and antitrust immunity for the alliance. Since Allegiant does not currently serve Mexico, through this 
alliance, its primary focus will be to broaden travel offerings to tourist-favorite Mexican destinations like Cancun, Los 
Cabos and Puerto Vallarta[10]. 
4. With air-travel demand improving, courtesy of increased vaccination, November traffic surged more than 100% 
year over year at Ryanair to 10.2 million. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in November 
2021 was 86% compared with 62% in November 2020. RYAAY operated more than 62,300 flights last month[11]. 
5. At Gol Linhas, November traffic and capacity increased 17.1% and 20.4%, respectively, year over year. Since 
traffic growth was less than capacity expansion, load factor deteriorated 2.3 percentage points to 82.1% last month. 
With steady improvement in travel demand in Brazil, traffic climbed 9.4% year over year in the first 11 months of 
2021[12]. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, causing the NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index to increase 10.1% to $82.26. This upside was mainly owing to the receding fears pertaining to 
the omicron variant of the coronavirus. Per early reports, the variant is likely to cause only mild illness. Over the 
past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 22.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? 
November traffic reports by some carriers are expected in the coming days.

Dec 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] November traffic report was highly impressive despite the rise in coronavirus cases in 
Europe. With air-travel demand skyrocketing from the 2020 levels, courtesy of increased vaccination, traffic surged 
more than 100% year over year to 10.2 million. Traffic in November 2020 was only two million at RYAAY. 
Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in November 2021 was 86% compared with 62% in 
November 2020. Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), operated more than 62,300 flights last month. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2]. 
Though the data was more upbeat than the 2020 scenario, Ryanair's traffic in November was 9.7% lower than 11.3 
million recorded in October 2021. This decline may have been due to the rising coronavirus cases in Europe. 
RYAAY operated more flights (in excess of 71,500 flights) in October from the November reading. 
Apart from the month-over-month decline, Ryanair's November traffic was below the pre-pandemic levels. The 
airline's November 2021 traffic fell 7.3% from the comparable period's level in 2019. Load factor in November 2019 
was also much higher, reading 96%. Key Picks Here are some better-ranked stocks within the broader 
Transportation[3] sector: 
Schneider National SNDR[4] currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). SNDR has a stellar surprise history as 
its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 
21%. 
Shares of Schneider National have rallied more than 19% so far this year. SNDR is being aided by a strong 
performance in the Intermodal and Logistics units. The Intermodal segment is benefiting from yield management 
and increased volumes. The Logistics unit is thriving on the back of favorable market conditions and other factors. 
Expeditors International of Washington EXPD[5] currently flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1. EXPD's earnings surpassed 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 29.1%. 
Shares of Expeditors have appreciated more than 32% so far this year. EXPD is being aided by an increase in 
airfreight revenues in this coronavirus-ravaged scenario. Evidently, Airfreight Services revenues increased 
approximately 54% year over year in the first nine months of 2021. We are also encouraged by EXPD's measures 
to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

Dec 01, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, news about the spread of the highly transmissible new COVID-19 variant (B.1.1529 strain) 
dominated headlines. First identified in South Africa, this new variant (Omicron) triggered fears of fresh travel curbs 
and dwindling air-travel demand. However, the two U.S. carriers, namely Delta Air Lines DAL[1] and United Airlines 
UAL[2], with direct flights to South Africa, decided not to adjust their schedule to South Africa. European carrier 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] also decided against canceling flights[4] in the wake of the new variant. An expansion-
related update was also available from Ryanair in the past week. 
Additionally, news on the alliance between American Airlines AAL[5] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[6] invited attention 
in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[7] Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Following the detection of the new variant, 
the United States decided to suspend and restrict the entry of foreign nationals in the United States. However, the 
restriction will apply only to the passengers who visited South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, 
Mozambique, Malawi and Eswatini during a fortnight prior to their landing in the United States. However, Delta, 
which currently operates flights connecting Johannesburg with Atlanta (thrice a week), did not make any changes in 
its schedule as yet. We believe that DAL's current stance may change if the Omicron variant becomes more deadly 
and is found in more countries across the globe. 
2. United Airlines, like Delta, is also likely to be hit by the U.S. government's travel restrictions stemming from the 
detection of the Omicron mutant. UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), operates non-stop flights 
connecting Johannesburg with Newark. UAL intends to start flights to Cape Town from today. Currently, UAL like 
DAL, did not have plans to tweak or trim the number of flights to South Africa due to the Omicron spread. However, 
any shift in the schedule cannot be ruled out in the coming days if the new strain worsens the situation at large. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
3. Ryanair announced plans to open a new base in Madeira, Portugal during summer 2022. This new base will 
widen RYAAY's connectivity, with 10 new routes linking Madeira with several European destinations, including 
mainland Portugal, throughout the year. With this, the carrier will offer more than 40 flights per week. The 10 new 
routes to Madeira, include Brussels Charleroi, Dublin, Lisbon, London Stansted Airport, Manchester, Marseille, 
Milan Bergamo, Nuremberg, Paris Beauvais and Porto[9].

4. Per a Reuters report[10], the trial proceedings related to the lawsuit filed in September on antitrust grounds by 
the Justice Department (DOJ) and the officials in six states against the alliance between Jetblue and American 
airlines will begin on Sep 26, 2022. The court case alleges that the collaboration, which is already in operation, 
induces higher fares at the busy Northeastern U.S. airports. Consequently, the lawsuit demanded an end to the 
alliance. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week 
and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the red over the past week, causing the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index to decrease 7.7% to $78.53. Fears about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus induced this 
downside. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 27%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? November traffic reports by some carriers are expected in the coming days. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double" 
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround. 
Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent 
Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and 
Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up  > >[11]

Airline Stocks Plummet in Friday's Trading: Here's Why
Airline Stocks Plummet in Friday's Trading: Here's Why

Nov 29, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The aviation space started on a positive note this year after being battered in 2020 by the coronavirus-led 
dwindling passenger revenues. The airline stocks have been performing rather well in 2021. However, news about 
the spread of the highly transmissible new COVID-19 variant (B.1.1529 strain) is a dampener. The new strain 
(Omicron) — first identified in South Africa — induced fears of fresh travel curbs and the air-travel demand curve 
again going down. 
Adding to the woes, airline stocks faltered on Friday Nov 26, 2021, causing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to decline 
6.5%. Stocks like Delta Air Lines DAL[1], United Airlines UAL[2] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] decreased 8.3%, 
9.6% and 3.7%, respectively, on Nov 26 from Nov 25's closing. 
Following the detection of the new variant, the United States decided to suspend and restrict the entry of foreign 
nationals in the United States. However, the restriction will apply only to the passengers who visited South Africa, 
Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi and Eswatini during a fortnight prior to their landing 
in the United States. 
However, Delta, which currently operates flights connecting Johannesburg with Atlanta (thrice a week), did not 
make any changes in its schedule as yet. We believe that DAL's current stance may change if the Omicron variant 
becomes more of a threat and is found in more countries across the globe. Besides, DAL, currently carrying a 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), announced that those among its passengers who need to alter their travel plans (through Dec 
31, 2021) may do so without paying any change fees. 
The United Airlines like Delta, is also likely to be hit by the U.S. government's travel restrictions stemming from the 
detection of the Omicron variant. The United Airlines and DAL are reportedly[4] the only two U.S.-based carriers 
currently serving South Africa. UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), operates non-stop flights connecting 
Johannesburg with Newark. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
United Airlines intends to start flights to Cape Town from Dec 1. Currently, UAL like DAL did not make any 
announcements of plans to tweak or reduce flights to South Africa due to the Omicron spread. However, any 
change in schedule cannot be ruled out in the coming days if the new variant becomes more of a hindrance. In the 
event of such an unfortunate scenario materializing, passenger revenues at UAL that increased more than 300% 
year over year in the third quarter of 2021, may take a beating in the December quarter. 
Airline Stocks Plummet in Friday's Trading: Here's Why
With COVID-19 cases surging in Europe, European carrier Ryanair Holdings, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 
(Sell), is naturally feeling the heat. In fact, RYAAY's CEO Michael O'Learyreportedly[6]warned that following the 
renewed surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe, Christmas travel and early bookings for summer are likely to be 
disrupted. Last week, he was quoted saying, 'I think it's inevitable we will undermine confidence between now and 
Christmas, and that will disrupt Christmas and also unsettle people between Christmas and New Year when they 
would normally start booking their summer holidays." 
The detection of quite a few cases pertaining to the Omicron variant in the UK is likely to serve as a further 
dampener for the Ireland-based Ryanair. In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that people arriving in 
the UK will be required to undergo a PCR test (within the second day of their arrival) and self-isolate until a negative 
result is available. There are apprehensions that the spread of the Omicron variant is likely to hurt the recently 
witnessed increase in air traffic at RYAAY. Stay tuned for further updates on the highly contagious Omicron strain 
and the resultant impact on air-travel demand.

Nov 24, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1].unveiled its schedule for next year's summer. On a 
more somber note, RYAAY's CEO Michael O'Leary reportedly[2] warned that following the renewed surge in 
COVID-19 cases in Europe, Christmas travel and early bookings for summer are likely to be disrupted. 
Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] subsidiary Alaska Airlines launched nonstop services to Belize City, Belize from Seattle 
and Los Angeles. With air-travel demand picking up in the United States, management at Delta Air Lines DAL[4] 
stated that it expects to transport up to 5.6 million passengers in the Thanksgiving period this year. Additionally, 
American Airlines AAL[5] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[6] are seeking the dismissal of the lawsuit filed against their 
alliance. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[7] Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. As part of its summer 2022 schedule, 
Ryanair is adding 24 new routes to popular European destinations. RYAAY will operate more than 500 services 
from the UK airports next summer. Management said that adding 65 B737-8200 'Gamechanger' aircraft to its fleet 
by next summer will make the schedule 'the most sustainable and environmentally friendly'. This is because the 
B737-8200 'Gamechanger' aircraft offers 4% more seats, 16% less fuel and a 40% reduction in noise emissions. As 
part of its sustainable operations, RYAAY launched electric handling at 11 major European airports. The 24 new 
routes include Birmingham to Zadar, Bournemouth to Bergerac and Zadar, London (Luton Airport) to Burgas, 
Catania and Lublin, London (Stansted Airport) to Menorca and Madeira, Manchester to Vienna and Madeira as well 
as Newcastle to Ibiza, Zadar, Chania and Riga. 
2. With the winter holiday season round the corner, Alaska Airlines began a seasonal service running through May 
22, 2022, to Belize city from Seattle (Seattle-Tacoma International Airport) and a year-round service from Los 
Angeles (Los Angeles International Airport) on Nov 19. From Los Angeles, Alaska Airlines is operating flights four 
times per week to Belize City while from Seattle, it is running twice-weekly flights. The new flights to Belize add to 
the airline's existing services to Canada, Mexico and Costa Rica from its West Coast hubs[8]. 
3. Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), expects to transport up to 5.6 million passengers in the 
Thanksgiving period. The projection implies a significant increase from the actual number of passengers (2.2 
million) transported by DAL over the Thanksgiving period last year. With friends, families and relatives expected to 
connect during this phase, leisure travel is expected to get a boost. 
Airline Stock Roundup: 2022 Summer Schedule From RYAAY, DAL , ALK in Focus
To boost operations during the busy period, Delta made additional hirings in customer service and reservations. 
DAL also boosted its strength regarding flight attendants to meet the anticipated increase in the number of flights in 
operation. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9]. 
4. Per a CNBC report[10], American Airlines and JetBlue asked a U.S. judge to dismiss the lawsuit filed in 
September on antitrust grounds by the Justice Department (DOJ) and officials in six states. AAL and JBLU are 
asking for the lawsuit to be dismissed as the DOJ failed to justify the claim that the alliance, which is already in 
operation, hurt competition or escalated prices. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the 
major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the red over the past week, causing the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index to decrease 2.3% to $85.26. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 
19.5%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel demand picking up in the United States, expansion-related 
updates can be expected from U.S.-based carriers.

Belarus : EU to target firms trafficking migrants with 'blacklist'

Nov 23, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen sharply criticized Belarus for channeling migrants to its border, saying 
the move is a clear effort by Lukashenko to "destabilize the bloc."European Commission head Ursula von der 
Leyen said the EU would create a watchlist to deter intermediaries from transporting migrants to Belarus. 
Speaking at the European Parliament, von der Leyen said Brussels would stand in solidarity with Poland, Latvia, 
and Lithuania. 
She rejected the idea that there was a migrant crisis at Europe's eastern frontier, saying instead that it was an 
attempt by Belarus to "destabilize the bloc." 
What is the latest plan? 
Von der Leyen said she would propose rules to European Parliament lawmakers to "blacklist all means and modes 
of transport involved in trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants." 
"Today the Commission is putting forward a legislative proposal to do this," she said. 
Von der Leyen said the EU did not recognize President Alexander Lukashenko's regime, which the bloc says is 
using migration as a weapon. 
"It is the EU as a whole that is being challenged," von der Leyen said. "This is not a migration crisis. This is the 
attempt of an authoritarian regime to try to destabilize its democratic neighbors." 
"We agreed that to counter this behavior, it is important to coordinate our sanctions and to work with countries of 
origin and the airlines that are transporting migrants to Minsk." 
The commission chief said the EU was coordinating with the United States, Britain, and Canada on a new package 
of sanctions. 
Belarus airline barred from leasing jets 
Also, speaking to Strasbourg lawmakers, European Council President Charles Michel said the bloc was already 
planning to ban Belarus airline Belavia from leasing jets as part of the censure program. 
He told lawmakers that a decision by member states on an expanded sanctions package was "imminent." It would 
include the ban on leasing planes from EU-based companies, he said. 
Several other airlines have already halted or cut down on flights to Minsk since the EU complained that migrants 
were being tempted to Belarus with false promises about a route into the EU.  
Migrants — many of them fleeing war and poverty in countries such as Syria and Afghanistan — have been 
entering the European Union from Belarus, particularly via Poland. 
Belarus : EU to target firms trafficking migrants with 'blacklist'
Belarus is already under sanctions from Brussels for its crackdown on protesters who rejected elections held last 
year as fraudulent.  
Minsk officials also forcibly grounded a Ryanair plane in May to arrest a dissident journalist on board.

 A couple were left out of pocket after Ryanair flew them to the wrong country then refused to apologise. 
 Instead, the airline has blamed the couple for the mix-up, which saw them fly to Greece instead of their intended 
destination, Spain. 
 The issue also raised security questions as the pair got on a flight they were never meant to be on. 
 Humaira and Farooq Shaikh were set to fly to Seville on October 4, 2021, for a holiday. 
 They arrived at Stansted airport, checked in, went through pre-flight checks at the boarding gate and when they 
were on the plane, including their boarding passes being checked. 
 However, the plane went to Zakynthos, 1,200 miles away. 
 Still believing they were in Spain, the couple got off the plane, left the airport and got into a taxi. They then realised 
what had happened. 
 Humaira said: 'Our phones were saying 'Welcome to Greece' and then our taxi driver said 'this isn't Spain'.' 
 Due to its late departure from the UK, the cabin crew had not announced the destination. 
 The couple returned to the airport to speak to Ryanair staff. The couple said the staff laughed. 
 Humaira explained that Ryanair staff would only pay for one night in a hotel and a return trip to the UK, despite the 
next flight to London not being for another four days. 
 Humaira said: 'They would only pay for one night's accommodation, so we had to pay for another three.' 
 The alternative was to take two flights back to the UK, with a layover, which would have doubled the length of their 
trip. 
 The couple were forced to pay for the rest of their stay in Greece, but struggled due to the shock of the situation 
and not having great internet skills. 
 They had also packed for a walking holiday in Spain, not the sandy conditions of Zakynthos. 
 When they did fly back to the UK, they were not on the Ryanair system and nearly missed their flight. 
 They only made it because one staff member recognised them. 
 The trip had been a gift from their son Suleman, who was in England working. 
 Fortunately, he was able to arrange and pay for a hotel until his parents were able to return to the UK. 
 However, he says the incident has cost him around 1,100 as he lost the payments for a Spanish hotel and pre-
booked activities. 
Ryanair fly Couple to Wrong Country then Blame them for Error
 Suleman told The Mirror[1]: 
 'I am completely outraged and shocked that this has been allowed to happen.' 
 'Not only is this a complete lack of safety, security and responsibility, but it has triggered severe strain and anxiety 
on my parents. 
 'My mum already suffers frompost-traumatic stress disorderand anxiety, and receiving her calls to me crying on the 
phone from Greece, whilst at work, was extremely distressing to hear.' 
 Since the incident, Ryanair has not apologised or offered compensation. Instead, the airline blamed the couple. 
 An email from Ryanair to the couple read: 
 'All of the Ryanair bag drop desks in the departure area are clearly identified. 
 'The screens above them display the flight number and destination. 
 'Each customer's boarding card clearly states their flight number and destination. Customers are also advised to 
check the airport information screens for the boarding gate number. 
 'It is the responsibility of every passenger to ensure that they follow the correct procedures and take note of the 
information available to them.' 
 A Ryanair spokesperson said: 'It is each customer's responsibility to ensure they board the correct aircraft. 
 'As these passengers passed through security control pre-boarding there was no security risk. 
 'We are working with our handling agents in London Stansted to ensure that this error doesn't reoccur.'

Is Lukashenko setting a new trap for Europe?

Nov 19, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 One can hardly imagine the misery of the refugees at the border between Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. 
Thousands of people from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, many of them Kurds and Yazidis, are camping in the woods 
in freezing temperatures with little supplies and no medical care. And they all have only one goal - they want to 
enter the EU, with most of them wanting to reach Germany. 
 They all have been lured by the dictator of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. The Belarussian national airline 
Belavia, along with Turkish Airlines, allegedly chartered pflights and brought the people to the Belarussian capital 
Minsk. From there they were taken by bus to the border with Poland and Lithuania. A few hundred managed to 
cross the green border at first, then to Germany. 
 The Polish army then built a tight cordon along the 400 km long border with barbed wire and soldiers. Refugees 
were turned back with water cannons, tear gas and batons. They then attacked the border guards with stones and 
whatever else they could use. 
 The Polish authorities do not allow journalists to reach the border and have sealed off a three-kilometre-wide strip 
as a prohibited zone. This has made direct reports from the border rare. A correspondent from Switzerland's Neue 
Zürcher Zeitung, Ivo Mijnssen, was in the area of the border zone and reported: 'The misery is indescribable. I was 
in the forests with a delegation of doctors. We found a woman with 5 children who had a body temperature of only 
25 degrees and took her to a hospital. She could be saved for the time being.' 
 Polish military vehicles usually take such migrants back to the border with Belarus soon after initial treatment. 
Requests for asylum are not accepted. 
 Belarus' dictator is deliberately using migrants to blackmail the EU 
 Lukashenko's actions are part of his reaction to sanctions that were imposed by the EU after last year's rigged 
presidential election. These were tightened again after a state-sponsored hijacking of a passenger plane last spring. 
Lukashenko ordered the Belarussian Air Force to intercept and force a Ryanair flight flying from Athens to Vilnius to 
land in order to arrest an opposition member that was on board the flight. 
 Lukashenko has upped the stakes in his ongoing war with the West by trying to forces thousands of illegal migrants 
across Poland's - and the EU's - borders. Furthermore, he deliberately chose the timing, as Germany has yet to 
form a new government after their federal elections in October. 
Is Lukashenko setting a new trap for Europe?
 Sadly, the EU also acted in a rather clueless and uncoordinated manner, and has done so since the beginning of 
the crisis. Poland's right-wing government is itself in conflict with Brussels over political interference in the Polish 
judiciary. Just prior to the outbreak of the migrant crisis, the EU's highest court imposed a €1 million daily fine on 
Warsaw in an attempt to persuade the Poles to abolish its new disciplinary chamber. 
 Poland's government has refused to let officials from the EU border protection agency Frontex - which is based in 
Warsaw - to the border and has rejected offers of help from other countries.  
 According to Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Germany, in particular, should have a special interest in 
protecting the EU's external border. Morawiecki demanded that the new German government immediately stop the 
Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline as part of a response to the hybrid war that is being carried out against 
Europe.  
 'We are defending the EU border here in Poland. And when we talk about the bigger picture: Let's work together for 
peace and not give Vladimir Putin extra money through energy payments so he can keep arming.' 
 The EU was reluctant to impose new, more severe, sanctions on Belarus. Reports have indicated that the new 
round embargoes would have included cutting the country off from international payments. Lukashenko, for his part, 
threatened to cut off a natural gas pipeline running through his country, which would limit the supply of Russian gas 
to Europe.  
 This time, however, Lukashenko's patron in the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, did not agree. 
 Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke twice on the phone with Lukashenko this week. According to 
information from Minsk, a deal was negotiated: The EU would take in 2,000 refugees, and Lukashenko would 
repatriate the remainder, about 5,000 people, back to the Middle East. A first plane did indeed take over 400 of the 
migrants on November 18, all of which had agreed to be sent back to Iraq. 
 The European Commission has so far strictly rejected negotiations with Minsk. In the meantime, however, 
Lukashenko seems to be trying to de-escalate the situation: Apparently, he fears that several thousand migrants 
could remain in Belarus permanently. He may also be worried that control of the situation on the border with Poland 
and Lithuania could slip from his grasp. Or, in the worst-case scenario, he may want to set a new trap for the EU. 
 The EU should now quickly start talks with Lukashenko's patrons in the Kremlin. Putin must fear that the conflict 
could postpone the completion and bringing on line the new Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline through the Baltic 
Sea to Germany. 
 To be sure, Moscow has so far done everything to weaken and divide the EU. The ill-fated visit by Europe Foreign 
Affairs chief, Josep Borrell, in March marked a low point in relations between Moscow and Brussels. At that 
meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov utterly embarrassed Borrell. Despite that, a dialogue between the 
EU and Russia must be restarted. This is the only way to prevent further provocations by Lukashenko and thus 
further, and even greater, human suffering. To that end, even a real war can no longer be excluded.

 After a quiet start with only news about passenger to freighter conversions,Boeing[1] finally announced orders for 
new aircraft on the third day of Dubai Airshow. However, to none of the two occasions, media was invited. Day 3 
Dubai Airshow: Boeing finally gets some new aircraft deals. 
 The afternoon announcement was for Indian start-up Akasa Air[2], which plans to launch in the summer of 2022. 
The airline formed by ex Jet Airways executive Vinay Dube and owned by SNV Aviation had ordered 72 MAX. The 
exact numbers haven't been confirmed, but this will be a mix of the MAX 8 and the high-density MAX 8200. This 
makes Akasa the fifth airline to operate the 8200 after Ryanair and its two subsidiaries Buzz and Malta Air, while 
Vietjet has also ordered this version with a 200-seat cabin capacity. AirInsight discussed Akasa recently in this 
webcast.[3] 
 Boeing calls the order 'a key endorsement of the 737 family's capability to serve the rapidly growing Indian market.' 
SpiceJet is also a MAX customer, but the market is dominated by Airbus[4], which has placed huge numbers of 
A320neo-family aircraft with Indigo and Go Air (now Go First). The MAX order has a list price of nearly $9.0 billion. 
 In a Boeing media statement, Dube is quoted as saying: 'We believe that the new 737 MAX airplane will support 
our aim of running not just a cost-efficient, reliable and affordable airline, but also an environmentally friendly 
company with the youngest and greenest fleet in the Indian skies.' 
 He added, 'India is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world with unparalleled potential. We are 
already witnessing a strong recovery in air travel, and we see decades of growth ahead of us. Akasa Air's core 
purpose is to help power India's growth engine and democratize air travel by creating an inclusive environment for 
all Indians regardless of their socio-economic or cultural backgrounds.'

Air Tanzania adds MAX to the fleet 
Earlier in the day, Boeing confirmed orders for Air Tanzania. The carrier will add a third 787-8 to its existing 
Dreamliner fleet. It also ordered one 767-300F, plus two MAX. Boeing didn't specify the version but from the 
animated picture it looks like the carrier has selected the MAX 9. The carrier's current single-aisle fleet consists of 
just two Airbus A220 as it retired some A320ceo's and 737-800s. Air Tanzania plans to use the aircraft from the 
latest order, which has a list price of $726 million, to expand its network to Africa, Asia, and Europe.

 The EU is set to slap fresh sanctions on Minsk for alleged human trafficking, as a stand-off on the Poland-Belarus 
border continues. But will they make a difference?As people camp out on the border between Belarus and Poland 
in freezing conditions, Brussels is squaring up to Minsk and brandishing a new tool it hopes will help turn the crisis 
around: fresh sanctions. 
EU foreign affairs ministers met in Brussels on Monday to give their backing to new criteria for sanctions, giving the 
bloc legal power to target individuals and entities it holds responsible for trafficking migrants toward its borders in 
what it has labeled a "hybrid attack." 
What to expect from fresh sanctions 
Ministers gave political backing to an entire new sanctions package, though the names of those targeted are yet to 
be revealed. 
EU High Representative Josep Borrell said they would affect an "important number" of people, while German 
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas went further: "Everyone who participates in the human trafficking that Lukashenko is 
conducting will be sanctioned by the EU," Maas told reporters after the meeting. 
The foreign minister of Lithuania — one of the countries that share a border with Belarus — wants the bloc to target 
Minsk airport to make it a "no-fly zone." Certain airlines and travel agencies may also be in the EU's sights. 
Borrell said the list of sanctions targets should be finalized in the coming days, though two EU diplomats told DW it 
may take up to two weeks before they come into force. 
Which sanctions are already in place? 
There was a sense of deja-vu in Brussels on Monday. That's because the bloc has already imposed no fewer than 
four rounds of sanctions on Belarus since October 2020, after the EU accused Minsk of rigging the 2020 
presidential election and perpetrating human rights abuses against pro-democracy protesters and activists. 
Brussels has so far targeted 166 people and 15 entities with measures including asset freezes and travel bans. The 
last round of sanctions followed the alleged hijacking of a Ryanair plane in May 2021. 
Minsk has denied any wrongdoing and Alexander Lukashenko remains in power. 
 Are sanctions making a difference? 
For Francesco Giumeli, a professor in International Relations at the University of Groningen and an expert on EU 
sanctions, the measures have signaled solidarity within the bloc.  
"The very fact that the European Union can actually send a signal is already a sign of unity," he told DW. 
Will fresh EU sanctions on Belarus make a difference?
That positive outlook is echoed by one Polish official who spoke to DW during Monday's talks. "Dictatorships can 
easily survive sanctions because they put all the cost of those sanctions on their society. But now in Belarus, there 
is a moment where this is no longer possible," he said. 
"That's why I think they will be very helpful." 
But with Alexander Lukashenko still in power and Minsk denying any wrongdoing, critics, however, have been 
skeptical about whether the sanctions will prove effective. 
Earlier in June, former Foreign and Defense Minister of Lithuania Linas Linkevicius wrote in Carnegie Europe: "To 
answer the question directly and briefly, sanctions will not change Lukashenko himself, because he has already 
exceeded all possible limits and does not intend to return to the usual tactics of balancing between Russia and the 
West." 
In November he wrote on Twitter: "And all activities of #Belarus carried out under the supervision of #Russia which 
enjoys the role of 'back seat driver' in almost all crises it inspired. Nothing will be solved until #Russia is efficiently 
and tangibly targeted." 
 Flight bans 'more effective' than sanctions 
Over the last few days, top EU officials have traveled to countries including Iraq, Lebanon and the United Arab 
Emirates in a huge diplomatic effort to prevent what they see as Minsk luring people toward the EU. 
That approach has shown results. Turkish Airlines, Iraqi Airlines and Syrian carrier Cham Wings Airlines are among 
those placing restrictions on or suspending flights into Belarus. 
Meanwhile, the first repatriation flight carrying Iraqi citizens will leave Belarus on Thursday. 
"The decision taken by Turkish Airlines, for example, is to be welcomed because there were a lot of people 
transiting through these places on their way to Minsk," said Amanda Paul, a senior policy analyst at the European 
Policy Center, to DW. 
"I think this will have a bigger impact than the sanctions." 
Still, she fears that the situation on the ground may get worse before it can finally be resolved. 
'All sanctions have side effects' 
EU sanctions were more of a blunt instrument in the past, said Giumeli, but have gradually become more targeted 
over the years to mitigate their impact on ordinary people. 
Still, he said, "all sanctions have side effects." 
"The more you sanction airlines, for example, the more you isolate Belarusian society and that is a big trade-off," 
Giumeli said. "At some point, as in many conflictual situations, you might have to accept that you take these costs 
because the violation that you're trying to deal or address is higher than the cost." 
Will Russia also be sanctioned? 
Many in Brussels suspect the Kremlin is complicit in orchestrating the crisis on the Poland-Belarus border, though 
Moscow denies involvement. 
"I don't think Lukashenko could be doing what he's doing without strong support from Russia," EU foreign affairs 
chief Borrell told reporters Monday. 
So why can't the EU just slap sanctions on Moscow if it wants to strike at the alleged core of the problem? 
"You can't simply target whoever. You need to have reasons and you need proof," Giumeli said, adding that those 
targeted by sanctions can dispute the measures by suing the bloc. 
"It's very difficult to prove connections — it's very technical," Giumeli said. 
Paul says Europe shouldn't spend too much time pointing fingers at Moscow. 
"There's a tendency to give more focus to Russia's activity and the malign role that Russia plays in the region, 
rather than actually looking at concrete ways to actually end this crisis," she said.

 The EU is far from being at the end of its "sanctions spiral" against Belarus, says Germany's top diplomat Heiko 
Maas amid a standoff with Minsk over migrants.Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Monday said the 
European Union will impose further sanctions to address decisions by Belarusian authorities.  
The bloc's foreign ministers are meeting Monday to discuss sanctions against Minsk over what the European Union 
says is a "hybrid attack" on its borders.  
The EU accuses Minsk of flying migrants, most of them from the Middle East, to the Belarus-Poland border, where 
they seek to enter the bloc's territory.  
What did Maas say?  
"We are nowhere near the end of the sanctions spiral," Maas said before the EU foreign ministers' meeting in 
Brussels. 
The top German diplomat warned airlines to stop transporting migrants to Minsk, or face being banned from landing 
in Europe. 
"What we see in Minsk, this inhumane system of using refugees as tools to exert pressure on the European Union, 
has not improved, but has gotten worse over the last days," he said. "We will further tighten sanctions." 
What are the proposed sanctions? 
Arriving at the meeting in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters the ministers would approve 
further sanctions on Minsk on Monday. 
The EU foreign ministers are expected to adjust the types of sanctions that can be imposed to include airlines and 
travel agents allegedly involved in the standoff at the Belarusian borders with EU member states Poland, Latvia and 
Lithuania. 
The measures are set to involve asset freezes and travel bans. Those affected by the sanctions will be named in 
coming days.  
Borrell said he had told Belarus' foreign minister over the weekend that the situation on the border was 
unacceptable and that humanitarian help was needed. 
"What we have to provide is humanitarian assistance to these people and to prevent any kind of hybrid attack 
against European Union borders," Borrell said. 
What is the row with Belarus? 
Poland has said thousands of migrants are stranded on its border with Belarus and reported breaches of the barrier 
there. 
Germany warns EU 'will tighten' sanctions on Belarus
Western governments accuse the regime of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring migrants to his 
country and sending them to cross into the EU in retaliation for earlier sanctions. 
The bloc imposed those sanctions in response to a Belarusian crackdown on dissent in the wake of last year's 
presidential election. 
The EU slapped Minsk with further sanctions earlier this year after Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair flight to 
land in Minsk and arrested a dissident journalist who was on board.  
What does Belarus say? 
Minsk has repeatedly denied the accusations and said Warsaw was deliberately escalating tensions. 
Lukashenko had warned that Belarus could cut off natural gas flows from Russia to Europe if the EU imposed 
further sanctions. But the Kremlin distanced itself from that threat. 
On Monday, Belarus state news agency Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying that Minsk is trying to persuade 
migrants living in camps near its western border to return home. 
"Active work is underway in this area, to convince people: Please, return home. But nobody wants to go back," 
Lukashenko said, as quoted by Belta.  
Lukashenko also threatened to send the migrants via the Belarusian state-run airline Belavia to Germany if Poland 
does not provide a "humanitarian corridor."  
"We will send them to Munich by our own planes, if necessary," he said. 
Last week, Belavia announced that it would not allow Iraqi, Syrian and Yemeni nationals to fly from Turkey to 
Belarus, following a similar Turkish decision.  
What is the current situation at the Poland-Belarus border? 
Migrants are camped out in freezing cold weather and dire conditions. 
Polish authorities have reported at least nine deaths near the border with Belarus — including a 14-year-old Kurdish 
boy who died of hypothermia. "The death toll will be rising, as it's getting colder by the day," said DW correspondent 
Barbara Wesel in Poland. 
Poland put the number of people on the border at between 3,000 and 4,000, with more arriving every day.  
It has been difficult to verify reports of what exactly is happening at the border due to Poland's state of emergency, 
which bars most journalists and aid workers from accessing the area. 
While Poland heightened security and increased troops at the border, Belarus has conducted military drills with its 
key ally Russia near the border.

 Moscow, Minsk and Their Migration Blackmail 
Marianna Prysiazhniuk 
The situation with migrants crossing over from Belarus into Poland could have turned into a case Belarus 
blackmailing the EU this past summer, it did not, but in the past few weeks the situation has become particularly 
heated. Belarusian state media and their sponsors, the Russian propaganda machine are blaming the West for this 
crisis, using their traditional narratives of western provocation and escalation. This time Ukraine also got caught in 
the crossfire, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenka accused Ukraine of organizing the transit of migrants into 
Belarus and further to the Polish border. 'This is how these Afghans go, through the Central Asian republics, 
through Russia, through Belarus and further. And they also go through Ukraine, but Ukraine is 'their own' (the 
West's own, ed.) so they keep quiet about that. Belarus is a stranger, so it gets trashed' Lukashenka said[1] in an 
interview with the Russian defense publication National Defense. 
However, based on our StopFake fact checkers' analysis of the information on the migrant crisis coming out of 
Belarus and Russia, it is not the West and Ukraine but rather Moscow and Minsk that have unleashed a campaign 
to force the West to cooperate with the Lukashenka regime, which after the violent crackdown of 2020 did not even 
merit a handshake from the West. And Russia, true to form, sells its services to resolve the problem that Moscow 
itself created. 
The situation on the Belarusian with the EU members Poland and Lithuania began to heat up this summer after the 
Belarusian authorities kidnapped journalist Roman Protasevich by intercepting a Ryanair flight. After a wave of 
criticism was directed at the leader of the Belarusian regime, Alexander Lukashenko threatened Europe with an 
uncontrolled flow of migrants and smugglers, whom, he implied, Belarus had been holding back all this time, 
worrying about western borders. Soon thereafter Belarus announced its withdrawal from the readmission 
agreement, which involved returning illegal immigrants to their country of origin or to a country of transit. 
What Do Putin and Lukashenka Have to Do with It?
'We want to warn the Polish side in advance against using any provocations directed against the Republic of 
Belarus to justify possible illegal military actions against disadvantaged unarmed people, among whom there are 
many women and underage children,' the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said[2]. 
The situation on the Belarusian-Polish border is critical. According to various sources there are several thousand 
migrants on the border with Poland, they are accompanied by armed Belarusian security forces, several hundred 
more are at the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. 
In his National Defense interview[3] Lukashenka said the transit of these refugees was organized by accomplices 
from the West and from Belarus, and the situation in Belarus is just one stage of the transit scheme. 
It is interesting to note that in this same interview Lukashenka repeats Moscow's messaging about how the West 
destroyed Middle East regimes word for word. 'After all, all this happened in front of my very eyes' Lukashenka told 
the pro-Kremlin Igor Korotchenko[4] of National Defense. Lukashenko recalled that he knew many of the Middle 
East dictators, Hafez Assad, Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi. '#8216;We were in very close, good relations 
with them. We met with them. I'll tell you - the greatest thinkers. These are people who, by virtue of their position, 
understood very well what was happening. These were the leaders in their states. And these scoundrels just killed 
them. They killed them' Lukashenka said. 
Belarusian state television sets the tone for the coverage of this crisis, but Russian media are not lagging far 
behind. Belarusian state channels Belarus 1 and Belarus 24 claim that the migrant groups are mainly Kurds and 
Yazidis, people who do not have a state of their own and who are fleeing the chaos that the West has unleashed. 
The West is accused of provoking and aggravating the situation, and of a fascist approach to resolving the conflict. 
The Belarus 1 state channel interviewed a certain Piotr Petrovsky who said that Poland was mobilizing too many 
security forces in response to the flow of migrants. 'The situation on the border is very tense, we see an escalation 
on the part of Poland, the use of a maximum number of security troops, moreover those security troops who are not 
suitable for working with civilians,' Petrovsky told Belarus 1[5]. 
Neither Petrovsky nor his colleagues mention the fact that armed people accompany the migrants towards the 
Polish border across Belarus. Polish border guards published the evidence: video footage[6] of Belarusian security 
forces directing a column of refugees to the Polish border at gunpoint. 
'He (Putin - ed.) wants to use Lukashenka in the same way he uses puppet governments in the occupied territories 
of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. He demands that the governments of these countries negotiate with the 
separatists, with people whom many call terrorists. He demands that Europe conduct a dialogue with the illegitimate 
president,' said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielus Landsbergis. 
Poland and Lithuania are calling Belarus' actions blackmail, staged by Moscow. Judging by the messages 
disseminated by pro-Kremlin media, this fully reflects the intentions of Moscow and Minsk. 
'To resolve the situation, the Belarusian authorities are insisting on a direct and equal dialogue with the EU, which 
would be de-facto recognition of the Belarusian leadership by the European Union,' writes Rusbalt. 
Announcing Minsk's alleged readiness to negotiate the refugee issue with the EU on state television, Belarusian 
political commentator Alexander Shpakovsky lay the blame for the situation on the West,[7] portraying Belarus as 
completely innocent of any manipulation of the situation. 
What Do Putin and Lukashenka Have to Do with It?
'The Polish and Lithuanian sides are literally behaving like fascists toward these refugees: they beat them torture 
them, kill them. The Republic of Belarus did not initiate this migration crisis. The Republic of Belarus is interested in 
its resolution. The Republic of Belarus is ready for negotiations on any level with any partners' Shpakovsky said. 
Judging by the humanitarian crisis that the migrant situation is quickly turning into because of Belarus' blackmail, 
Minsk's declarations of willingness to negotiate look increasingly like coercion. By accusing Poland and Lithuania of 
fascism, Minsk is attempting to get out of the sanctions the West has imposed and the international isolation that 
the country is in because of Alexander Lukashenka's presidential election falsification and the massive repressions 
unleashed against the opposition that challenged those falsified election results. Which means that despite all 
propagandist attempts to portray the sanctions regime as ineffective, the sanctions are in fact an effective method 
of pressure on this regime.

 North East prospective holidaymakers can now book flights from Teesside International Airport, as Ryanair's 
summer 2022 flights go on sale. 
 The airline will be running a twice-weekly service on Tuesdays and Saturdays to Majorca from 29 March to 29 
October, with Faro, Portugal, also running every Wednesday and Saturday between 30 March and 29 October. 
Flights to the Greek island of Corfu will depart on Fridays from June. 
 The summer flights also join Ryanair's service from Teesside to Alicante, which has become a year-round service 
due to local demand, and which departs every Monday and Friday. 
 The news follows the announcement that Loganair will begin operating a one-stop service between Teesside and 
Esbjerg in Denmark, travelling via Aberdeen but without any need for passengers to leave the plane. 
 Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: 'The fantastic uptake of this year's summer flights shows that people are 
really eager to get away after a difficult 18 months, and that support has meant that Ryanair is continuing to back 
our airport once again by putting next year's tickets on sale now. 
 'Thanks to this vote of confidence in our amazing airport, people from across Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool 
can get to some of the most popular summer hotspots in just a few short hours without the tedious travel times to 
airports such as Newcastle, Leeds Bradford or Doncaster, with our freshly redeveloped terminal delivering a fast, 
efficient and friendly service.' 
 A spokesperson for Ryanair said: 'Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, is committed to re-building the UK's aviation and 
tourism industries. We are excited to continue working with Teesside Airport and to connect passengers in the 
North East to their favourite holiday destinations next summer including Alicante, Corfu, Faro and Majorca.'

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
The Belarusian state propaganda machine launches attacks in support of the regime's cynical instrumentalisation of 
migrants. 
In recent weeks, the tensions between Belarus and neighbouring EU member states have taken a worrying turn for 
the worse. Belarus' systemic andcynical instrumentalisation of migrants for political purposes[2], and its attempts to 
destabilise the eastern EU borders, entered a new phase of escalation. According to news sources, columns of 
migrants,flown in to Minsk from a number of countries[3], wereguided by the Belarusian authorities[4]towards the 
Polish border, where clashes ensued. 
Against this backdrop, the EU Commission has called forEU member states to approve an extended sanctions 
regime against the Belarusian authorities[5]; the Polish authoritieshave been forced to increase the number of 
soldiers and border guards[6]protecting the EU's external border; and theLithuanian authorities declared a state of 
emergency[7]on the country's border with Belarus. 
Whose fault is this hybrid attack against the EU, as the President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, put 
it? If you ask the Belarusian propaganda machinery and pro-Kremlin outlets, the answer becomes clear - it isthe 
collective West[8],the Polish authoritiessending tanks to the border[9], and theEU adopting sanctions for its internal 
purposes[10]. 
All these pieces of disinformation distract from the fact that 'the authoritarian regime in Belarus is exploiting human 
beings for political reasons[11]', as EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson stated. Belarus is cynically exploiting 
migrants in trying to exact revenge on the EU, which does not recognise the falsified results of the last Belarusian 
Presidential elections and has imposed restrictive measures against the regime and individuals for, among other 
Who's To Blame?
reasons, repression of peaceful demonstrators, human rights violations, and the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in 
Minsk. 
Poland and Lithuania have found themselves in the crosshairs of pro-Kremlin outlets in other areas than the 
ongoing migration crisis. For example, according to one source, Poland ispreparing for war with Russia and 
Belarus[12], which sounds like a rather outlandish theory to say the very least. Lithuania, in turn, has been cast as 
anaggressive human rights violator[13], which according tocredible sources[14]appears to be far from the truth, and 
a case of psychological projection. 
An escalating situation such as the one currently unfolding on the EU's eastern external border, often features vast 
amounts of disinformation. It serves the aggressor's purpose to muddle the waters, cast the blame elsewhere, and 
frame their own actions as righteous. Furthermore, soiling the adversary's external image is high up on the 
aggressor's campaign plan. All this is evident also in the current situation, and in the disinformation bursts from pro-
Kremlin and Belarusian regime outlets. 
Other notable examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation claims this week: 
 Pro-Kremlin outlets' timeless classic:NATO violated its pledge not to move eastwards;[15]No, we don't:Western 
Europeans perceive the Poles as 'Eastern barbarians' and 'Slavic pigs';[16]Oh, yes, it happened - illegally, mind 
you:Russia did not annex Crimea.[17]

 German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has accused Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of "unscrupulously 
exploiting" the migrants by sending them towards Poland.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called for new EU 
sanctions against Belarus on Wednesday amid an escalating migrant crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border. 
Thousands of people are stranded at the EU's eastern border in freezing weather, with Warsaw accusing Russia 
and Belarus of using the migrants to threaten European security. 
What did Germany's foreign minister say? 
Maas said in a statement that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is "unscrupulously exploiting" the 
migrants and sending them to the border region. 
"We will sanction all those who participate in the targeted smuggling of migrants," the German foreign minister 
asserted, while adding that the EU will push to "extend and tighten ... sanctions against Lukashenko's regime." 
Any fresh sanctions could target not only countries involved in smuggling the migrants but also airlines that faciliate 
their travel to Europe. 
EU officials accuse Belarus of weaponizing the migrants against the 27-member bloc in retaliation for previous 
sanctions against Minsk. Lukashenko has denied that his government is orchestrating the migrant crisis. 
Maas said the images of the thousands of migrants at the Polish-Belarusian border are "appalling." 
Maas' remarks come after German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Tuesday edition of Germany's Bild 
tabloid that the EU needs to do more to help Poland secure its border. Poland has refused to let the migrants in. 
How has the EU responded so far? 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for "approval of extended sanctions" against Belarus 
on Monday. 
The bloc has previously approved four rounds of sanctions targeting 166 people and 15 entities linked to 
Lukashenko's regime. 
Tensions have been fraught between the EU and Belarus since the state-ordered hijacking of a Ryanair flight over 
Belarusian territory in May. 
The EU has also condemned last year's presidential election in Belarus as neither free nor fair, with Lukashenko 
having declared a landslide victory against opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.

 In the past week, management at Delta Air Lines DAL[1] issued an encouraging update on bookings pertaining to 
international travel. Brazilian carrier Azul AZUL[2] was also in the news as it released its October traffic report, 
which was aided by the upbeat air-travel demand scenario in Brazil. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[3] October traffic 
release was also impressive, courtesy of the uptick in air-travel demand in Europe. 
In keeping with its environmentally-friendly attitude, Southwest Airlines LUV[4] inked a long-term deal with Velocys 
Renewables, an international sustainable fuels technology company. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. 
International travel demand is also recovering following the U.S. government's announcement to reopen 
international borders. Per the new policy, foreign nationals (from 33 countries) will have to be fully vaccinated when 
they fly to the United States. Evidently, management of Delta confirmed that a 450% surge in international bookings 
has been witnessed in six weeks' time since the above announcement. Flight DL106 from Sao Paulo to Atlanta was 
Delta's first international flight to touch down in the United States on Nov 8, under the new set of rules. To cater to 
the anticipated demand swell, Delta boosted its network this winter from the key European cities including London-
Boston, Detroit and New York-JFK, Amsterdam-Boston, Dublin-New York-JFK, Frankfurt-New York-JFK and 
Munich-Atlanta. 
2. In a bid to enhance its European footprint, Alaska Air Group's ALK[5] subsidiary Alaska Airlines announced a 
codeshare agreement with British Airways, thereby expanding its partnership with the latter, which is a member of 
the oneworld alliance. In fact, since joining the oneworld alliance on Mar 31, 2021, Alaska Airlines has broadened 
its network by 39%, adding 188 additional codeshare routes. The codeshare pact with British Airways gives Alaska 
Airlines an access to 16 additional markets[6]. 
3. Ryanair's October 2021 traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 11.3 million as air-travel demand 
continues to recover in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the period 
was 84% compared with 73% in October 2020. The airline operated more than 71,500 flights last month. Ryanair's 
October traffic also shows a sequential improvement of 6.6%.[7] 
We remind investors that Ryanair's top line had improved substantially in second-quarter fiscal 2022 owing to an 
increase in traffic as reported in the previous week's write up[8]. 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL 's Update on Foreign Travel, RYAAY , AZUL in Focus
4. Owing to the improvement in air-travel demand in Brazil, Azul's domestic traffic for the month of October 
skyrocketed 66% from the year-ago period's number. Capacity expanded 62.4% year over year in response to 
higher demand. With capacity growth outweighing the traffic increase, load factor (percentage of seats filled by 
passengers) moved northward in the month by 1.8 percentage points (p.p.) to 82.5%. Traffic and capacity 
(domestic) increased 6.1% and 8%, respectively, from the October 2019 (pre-pandemic levels) numbers. On the 
international front, traffic and capacity surged 20.4% and 3.1%, respectively, in October 2021 on a year-over-year 
basis. Consequently, load factor increased 11 p.p. to 76.3%. 
5. Southwest Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signed an offtake agreement spanning 15 years 
with Velocys for 619 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to be delivered over a period of 10 years. 
After being blended with conventional jet fuel, the SAF could produce the equivalent of 575 million gallons of net-
zero fuel, thereby avoiding 6.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide for more than 15 years. This Dallas-based 
carrier intends to start purchasing SAF from Velocys beginning 2026. Additionally, as part of the offtake agreement, 
the companies formed a long-term strategic relationship, under which Southwest Airlines is eligible to purchase 
significant volumes of SAF from the future Velocys facilities. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9]. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline 
players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, leading the NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index to increase 6% to $95.65. The upside was mainly owing to Delta's bullish commentary on 
international bookings. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 
7.8%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will look forward to the third-quarter 2021 earnings report of Copa 
Holdings CPA[10], scheduled to be released on Nov 17.

 Most of us are trying to be greener and for some that means seeking out brands and companies that are 
environmentally-friendly. But how can you check firms really are as green as they make out? 
Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads 
consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those products. 
 And businesses are being held to account on this in the way they advertise. But what do customers need to look 
out for to spot greenwashing? 
False claims or vague language 
The Advertising Standards Agency says this is the area it receives the most complaints about. And some firms have 
already had adverts banned. 
In 2019, the advertising regulator banned a Ryanair ad claiming it was the airline with Europe's lowest emissions 
without sufficient evidence to support the claim. And a Hyundai advert, claiming a car 'cleaned the air', was also 
judged by the ASA to be misleading. 
 Ingredients in a product being described as 'natural', 'organic' or 'eco-friendly', when only some of the ingredients 
can be described as this, can also fall into this category. 
 Sue Davies, head of Consumer Protection Policy at Which? says, in general, customers should try to find a 
secondary, authoritative source of information to back up manufacturers' claims. 
 'Think about the bigger picture. For example, can environmental claims made on a single-use plastic water bottle 
be taken seriously?' 
Images of nature or 'green' buzzwords 
Phrases such as 'eco', 'sustainable' and 'green' are commonly used by companies to make the business appear 
environmentally conscious - but they rarely pertain to any scientific standards. 
 A website for HDS Group's Amazing Cleaners, seen in July 2016, featured the claim '100% eco-friendly'. A 
complaint was upheld after it was found the statement was made without any evidence or explanation. 
 And an advert for Alpro Almond milk was also banned for a misleading environmental claim. The ad said the milk 
was 'good for the planet', branding it: 'Your recipe to a healthier planet.' Alpro said customers would understand the 
ad's slogan referred to plant-based products having a lower environmental impact. 
Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing
 But while the ASA said it understood the almonds used by Alpro were not sourced from areas where production 
could have a negative environmental impact, such claims must be clearer. 
Hiding information 
Fashion brands may promote clothes made of 'sustainable' fabrics, even if the rest of their clothing line is damaging 
to the environment. 
 For example, a firm could claim to be environmentally-friendly, but not take into account supply-chain emissions 
from a coal-powered overseas factory used to make part of a product. 
 Other industries have fallen foul of this. As far back as 2007, the ASA ruled against Shell for an ad implying it used 
waste carbon dioxide to grow plants, when the regulator actually found the quantity used was only a small fraction 
of its emissions. 
 In another example, Edward Bulmer claimed its paint was 'the most eco-friendly paint on the market', but failed to 
highlight the fact it contained various ingredients that were not environmentally-friendly. 
Look out for carbon offsetting 
A government, business or individual can attempt to balance their own emissions by finding other ways to remove 
an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon offsetting. 
 But environmental groups argue this is kicking the problem into the long grass rather than dealing with the issue of 
actually cutting emissions. 
 David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, says offsetting is the most popular form of 
greenwashing. 
 'It's riddled with fraud and allows firms to claim they're meeting emissions targets while they continuously pump 
emissions into the air.' He adds: 'The whole point of offsets is to allow these corporations to keep emitting with 
impunity and allow governments to claim they are meeting targets.' 
Check company ownership 
Larger firms, or conglomerations, with a high environmental impact have often bought smaller brands to target 
environmentally conscious customers who otherwise might not have chosen to spend with them. So knowing what, 
or who, the ultimate owner of a firm is could be important if you want to find out their entire environmental impact. 
 Accountability and authenticity, Prof Eccles says, are serious problems. An entire businesses' carbon emissions, 
he says, should be like calorie labels on a product, where 'everyone pays attention to them, they are certified 
independently and they influence consumer decisions'. 
 Professor Kimberly Nicholas, senior lecturer in sustainability at Lund University, in Sweden, told the BBC that the 
most effective action is for companies to commit to eliminating fossil fuels from each part of their supply chains: 
'Customers need to direct their money away from all firms that are producing or connected to financing fossil fuels.' 
She said: 'Without this action is useless.' 
Eco-friendly products in a wider range 
Some firms will market environmentally beneficial products, but will omit information about the impact of their other 
products. 
 Food company Quorn had an ad banned which involved the way carbon was certified for one of their products. 
ASA said the advert did not clarify what the claimed reduction of the carbon footprint was being measured against, 
and viewers would therefore not know what the basis of the reduction was. 
 Ms Davies, from Which?, says a lack of transparency is a key indicator that the company doesn't have a wholly 
positive environmental impact. 'If you're struggling to find environmental information about a product, brand or 
service, take that as a warning sign.' 
 'Companies that have something to hide - or no good stories to tell - often make it harder for consumers to check 
out their eco credentials,' she adds. 
Food company Gousto was found to have made false claims that its packaging was '100% plastic free and 
recyclable' last year Is the product and its packaging recyclable? 
The 'recyclable' label on some plastic items can be used for products that are not easy to recycle. 
 In 2018, McDonald's announced it was going to get rid of single-use plastic straws in its restaurants, and offer 
paper straws instead. But the following year, it was accused of greenwashing when it was revealed the straws 
weren't actually recyclable. 
 In 2019, the ASA said Ancol Pet Products was misleading customers by advertising dog waste bags as 
biodegradable after it was found that they would not biodegrade in their most likely destination of landfill or 
incineration.

too 'heavy' to lift off a conveyor belt and into the plane. 
Brandon Aughton, 24, was due to fly with his carer to Malaga, Spain from East Midlands Airport for his first holiday 
after two years shielding, before an apparent mix up between the flight operator and the cargo handling company 
meant he was removed.

Nov 08, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has launched a seat sale aimed at boosting its winter travel. 
The airline is offering 80,000 seats for a sale of 9.99 each in more than 530 routes across Europe for travel this 
November and December. In order to avail this offer, customers need to book their flights before midnight on Nov 
14. Some of the top destinations the carrier's Irish customers can choose from include Faro, Portugal; and 
Lanzarote, Malaga and Tenerife in Spain. 
Given the continued improvement in traffic, the low fares are expected to further boost demand. Evidently, the 
airline's October traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 11.3 million as air-travel demand continues to 
recover in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the period was 84% 
compared with 73% in October 2020. The European carrier's traffic has been rising steadily over the past few 
months. In September, traffic was 10.6 million compared with 5.2 million in the year-ago period. In August, traffic 
increased to 11.1 million from 7 million in the comparable period in 2020. The same rose to 9.3 million in July from 
4.4 
million 
in 
the 
year-ago 
period.

 By EUvsDisinfo[1] 
The Lukashenka regime's goal is painfully clear: there can be no independent media. 
EUvsDisinfo has been regularly monitoring how the illegitimate Lukashenka regime abuses its legal system and the 
security apparatus to shut down the very few remaining independent voices. The targets include journalists, 
regionaloutlets, Telegram channels and their followers and readers. 
The crackdown began after the rigged elections in August 2020, and there are so many cases and examples 
thereof that naming all of them would require hundreds of pages. Below we summarise the steps taken by the 
Lukashenka regime in the last six months. 
A more thorough picture is offered byJustice for Journalists[2]. In 2020 this London-based NGO collected more 
than1,500 documented cases of attacks[3]or threats against journalists in Belarus. Additionally, the Belarusian 
Association of Journalists has collecting similar data covering the period ofJanuary-September 2021[4]. 
 May 
 One of the largest regional newspapers, Intex-Press, ran an interview withSviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. The local 
prosecutor summoned the editor and turned to the court, which foundthe interview extremist. The editor was fined 
and the newspaper received an official warning. State-owned and private distribution networks subsequentlyrefused 
to sell the newspaper[5]fearing a backlash from the authorities. 
GUBOPiK (The Main Directorate for Combating Organised Crime and Corruption)published[6]a list of 40 'extremist' 
Telegram channels. This means that people who reposted content from these channels risk committing an 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
administrative offence. This means that these people facethreats of violence and revenge if they refuse to 'repent' 
on camera and they are guaranteed a prison term under squalid conditions for up to several months. 
Central and regional offices of the largest independent media outletTUT.BY[7]were searched, as well as the homes 
of editor in chief Maryna Zolotova and several journalists. The authorities accused the leadership of financial 
manipulation and a criminal investigation was launched. Zolotova, journalists, and other personnel were imprisoned 
and the website was blocked in Belarus. In a matter of days some of the journalists regrouped in exile and created 
a new website,zerkalo.io[8]. 
After the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to capture journalist Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega,forced video confessions[9]were broadcast on state TV and used as advertisements on YouTube to 
promote Telegram channel Zhioltyye Slivy, believed to be controlled by security services. 
 June 
 According to a report by The International Strategic Action Network for Security,Belarusian commentators are in a 
minorityon weekly news[10]programmes on three Belarusian state-owned TV channels.Instead, pro-Kremlin 
propagandists of Russian and Ukrainian origin prevail as guest commentators. They use their on-air time to spread 
a set of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives concerning Belarus, the Baltic states and Poland, Ukraine, 
and the West as a whole while Belarusian journalists are fired for their views. 
The Ministry of Justicebegan an examination[11]of the Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ), demanding that 
BAJ present thousands of documents within a few days. 
The Ministry of Interior designated the most popular independent media outlet, TUT.BY, and all its social media 
accounts as extremist. The motivation behind this step was to close down TUT.BY's Telegram channel that had at 
the time almost 600,000 subscribers. 
Yellow Plums (Zhioltyye Slivy), the key disinformation-spreading Telegram channel controlled by the Belarusian 
security services, announced the creation of an 'initiative group ofpro-governmental bloggers[12]'. However, the 
Telegram and YouTube channels and Instagram accounts mentioned were not popular, as the largest Telegram 
channel on the list had only 8,000 subscribers and the most popular YouTube account 21,000. 
Belarusian investigative journalist Dzianis Ivashyn, detained in March 2021 on dubious charges,had a heart 
attack[13]in prison. Ivashyn is 42 and had not had heart problems earlier. 
 July 
 The government terminated the accreditation of a correspondent office of the European Radio for Belarus 
(Euroradio) in Minsk. 
Sports journalist and author of the popularYoutube channel ChestnOK[14](72,300 followers) Alexander Ivulin was 
arrested. 
A well-known journalist and media manager, Andrei Alexandrov, wascharged[15]with high treason which is 
punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment. 
The editor of Nasha Niva, Yahor Martsinovich, and three other employees were detained on criminal charges. 
Martsinovich was beaten during detention and Nasha Niva's website was blocked. 
Following the crackdown on TUT.BY and the closure of its website, Onliner became the largest independent media 
website. Unsurprisingly, the apartment of Onliner journalist Nastasya Zanko was searched. 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
By early 2021 there were around twenty independent media outlets left in regions of Belarus outside of Minsk. 
Around half of them were attacked by security services on 8-9 July 2021. 
In Brest region, searches of editorial offices and apartments of journalists targeted all the remaining six independent 
media outlets. As for other regions, the apartments of about ten workers ofStrong News[16]were searched and 
equipment was seized. 
Orsha regional portal[17]was targeted, its editor Igor Kazmerchak was detained on criminal charges. 
The Telegram channel ofHrodna.Life[18]was declared extremist. 
An apartment belonging to a journalist working forbobr.by[19]website was searched. 
By 12 July, over 30 journalists were imprisoned in Belarus. A number of well-known Belarusian journalists, 
concerned about their safety in the light of the massive crackdown, relocated from Belarus. 
 August 
 After widely covering repression against athletes, the popular sport website Tribunaand its social media accounts 
were classified as extremist. 
The website of regional independent media Ex-press.by was blocked at the request of the Ministry of Information. 
A photographer of Novy Chasnewspaper was sentenced to 15 days of prison and the newspaper was denied its 
printing services. 
Popular blogger Vadim Yermashuk, whose Instagram account has over 45,000 subscribers, was detained for 
unknown reasons. 
The largest independent news agency, BelaPAN, and associated news internet portal Naviny.by were searched for 
the second time since January 2021. 
The court declared all publications of the largest media portal TUT.BY and an associated website, Zerkalo.io, as 
extremist. TUT.BY's publications arede factothe largest electronic archive of modern Belarusian history. Declaring it 
as extremist means the regime wishes to destroy it and rewrite history using repressive means. TUT.BY's chief 
editor, several top managers and a few journalists remained behind bars. 
Raman Pratasevich, the journalist captured in May after the forced landing of a Ryanair plane, gave an interview to 
pro-Kremlin RT and mentioned plans to launch a new media outlet. Sofia Sapega, Pratasevich's girlfriend, who was 
also arrested, was interviewed by one of the well-known Belarus 1 TV propagandists. Sapega said that she cannot 
rule out that the Ryanair incident was staged by Raman's colleagues and that the KGB was not on board. Excerpts 
from an earlier interview with Pratasevich were also shown, where he claims that the Ryanair incident was likely 
aprovocation staged by his former colleague[20]. 
Access to the news websiteReform.by[21]was blocked following a decision of the Ministry of Information. This came 
after TUT.BY, Naviny.by and others were shut down by the authorities raising the popularity of Reform.by, which 
offered regular political reporting. 
Onliner.by's Editor-in-Chief Nikolai Kozlovich resigned without explanation.Onliner.by[22]is a large Belarusian 
media outlet that largely stopped reporting on socio-political issues to avoid repression. 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
By the end of August all the largest independent media outlets were either banned by the state authorities, or 
largely stopped their political reporting. 27 journalists and bloggers remain imprisoned. 
The Supreme Court approved a Ministry of Justice request to liquidate the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 
 September 
 The Belarusian authorities declared more than 200 Telegram channels as extremist. The number of Belarus-
related Telegram channels spreading disinformation, many with direct and indirect links to the Belarusian 
authorities, exceeded 150. The 80 largest, along with toxic disinformation pages on other social media,can be found 
here[23]. 
The Ministry of Information blocked access to belaruspartisan.by, freesmi.by, and 6tv.by. 
All popular and (formerly) independent news websites in Belarus were blocked for people inside Belarus. In some 
cases, the domain names were also taken offline.The exception wasOnliner.by[24],which toned down its reporting 
and was still allowed to function. 
Homes ofby.tribuna.com[25]'s chair Maksim Beresinsky and former tribuna.by journalist Andrei Maslovsky were 
searched. 
The editor of the Green Portal,a Belarusian environmental NGO, was detained for three days after her home was 
searched. 
The website ofMedia-Polesye[26], one of the largest remaining regional independent media based in the Brest 
region, was blocked. 
Radio Racyja, a Poland-based media outlet broadcasting in the Belarusian language, was blocked. 
The websiteAugust2020[27], which published stories of people tortured by the state security forces and police 
following the elections, was blocked. 
A criminal case was opened against Andrei Kukharchik, chief editor of another regional media outlet in the Brest 
region,Virtual Brest[28]. 
The Brest region in the south-west of Belarus, right on the border with Poland, had the largest number of 
independent regional media outlets. All of them have now been repressed by the state authorities. 
The Ministry of Information published tenders for scientific papers concerning the methods of increasing trust in 
state-owned media. These services are estimated at around 40.000 euros. 
 October 
 After Gennady Mozheiko published a short article about IT specialist Andrei Zeltser,who was killed by security 
forces[29]after he opened fire and killed a KGB agent during a raid, the journalist was detained and now faces two 
criminal charges. The newspaper he was working for, Komsomolskaya Pravda v Belarusi, announced the closure of 
its office in Belarus. 
The Belarusian Investigative Committee launched a criminal case against the remaining employees of the largest 
independent media TUT.BY and 'other individuals'. The criminal case concerns incitement of hatred committed by a 
group of people. The case is probably related to the coverage of the shooting of IT specialist Andrei Zeltser and 
KGB agent Dzmitry Fedasiuk in Minsk, although the coverage seemed to be neutral. 
Treason, Extremism And Beatings: How Independent Media Risks Everything In Belarus
More than 200 people were detained and136 of them taken into custody[30]for publishing comments on the internet 
in connection with the deaths. According to human rights defenders, theirprison conditions amount to torture[31]. 
TheMinistry of Interior announced that 327 Telegram channels[32]and chats were recognised as extremist. This list 
also included SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya's Telegram[33]channel with 107,000 followers. 
The Ministry also introduced a new legal term, 'extremist formations'. In contrast to merely 'extremist', the 'extremist 
formation' means that followers of a Telegram channel can be criminally charged. The number of 'extremist 
formations' online recently reached double digits, including Nexta and Belsat. 
Dze.chat[34], a website uniting over a hundred local Telegram chats, was declared to be an 'extremist formation'. 
A man was detained by police who seized and inspected his phone. He wasdetained for 15 days[35]for sharing the 
Belsat webpage (Belsat is a Polish free-to-air satellite television channel aimed at Belarus) in his Instagram private 
chat. 
This example highlights the lengths to which the regime will go to in order to muzzle freedom of expression and 
even private communication in Belarus. It also proves that after demolishing independent media, persecuting 
journalists, blacklisting social media channels and creating legislation unheard of in the free world, the authorities 
have started going after individuals. 
With Belarus-based independent media pretty much outlawed, the state is trying to replace such voices with 
propaganda and disinformation. However, calling Deutsche Welle 'extremist' and blocking it shows that new targets 
include also foreign media that cover events in Belarus on a more or less regular basis. 
All of these actions aim to make people afraid of any information that does not come from the state. And it shows 
that the few remaining independent Belarusian journalists have incredible courage: they risk everything to offer their

 Despite a €57 million second-quarter operating profit, results ofWizz Air[1] remain under pressure. The ultra-low-
cost airline expects current market conditions with low fares and yields to result in a third-quarter loss of around 
€200 million that will most likely extend into the fourth quarter, it reported on November 4. Results Wizz Air under 
pressure despite strong Q2. 
 While Wizz Air returned to 2019 pre-Covid levels and flew close to ten million passengers at 98 percent capacity 
and an 84 percent load factor in August, the continued impact of the virus and travel restrictions dictate the market 
situation. Demand for the peak holiday season is strong but weak in the off-season. Like its competitor Ryanair said 
earlier this week, demand needs price stimulation by offering extra-low ticket fares. Especially premium and 
commodity markets are volatile and are impacting the airline's financial performance and unit costs, CEO Jozsef 
Varadi said. 
HY1 loss of 120.9 million 
The Central European carrier reported a €120.9 million net loss for its first six months of the financial year 2022, 
compared to €-243.1 million between March and September last year. The operating loss was €51.9 million 
compared to €-245.6 million. Revenues increased to €880.4 million versus €471.2 million. Ancillary revenues were 
actually higher at €466.6 million than passenger revenues, confirming a trend since FY21. The average revenue per 
passenger was €70.5, a decrease of 3.1 percent. Wizz and Wizz Air Abu Dhabi flew 12.5 million passengers in 
HY1, of which 9.5 million alone in Q2. In Q1, Wizz reported a €114.4 million loss.[2] 
 Rising fuel prices didn't have an impact on Wizz in the first six months. On the contrary, the airline benefitted from 
a gain of €4.3 million on discontinued hedges. Its fuel bill was 3.2 percent lower to €256.9 million compared to the 
previous year. Wizz hasn't hedged fuel anymore after deciding in June to adopt a 'no hedge' policy against the US 
Dollar and jet fuel prices after evaluating costs and benefits. This could be a risk if fuel prices remain high. 
 Wizz's financial position remains strong, with €1.7 billion in total cash by the end of September, up 3.3 percent over 
March. Total borrowings stand at €3.4 billion. 
 https://i2.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-04-2.png?ssl=1 
 Wizz has strengthened its market share in most markets it is serving. 
Results Wizz Air under pressure despite strong Q2
 Wizz Air continues its unabated growth strategy. In the past six months, it opened new bases in Italy and has 
positioned four aircraft in Rome and two each in Naples and Venice. This helped to grow its market share in Italy 
from three to nine percent. 
Despite foregoing its attempts to enter the Norwegian domestic market, it continues to base four aircraft in Oslo. 
Basis in Tirana, Sarajevo, Skopje, and Vilnius will be reinforced with one additional aircraft at each base, bringing 
the total number of aircraft in this region to sixteen. The UK will also be further developed but this depends on 
getting slots at London Gatwick. Wizz Air will have 44 bases next summer and operate 1.155 routes, chasing 
opportunities as other carriers reduce the capacity for next year. 
 Abu Dhabi is now coming into full swing as the Gulf region has relaxed travel restrictions, finally allowing its 
subsidiary to grow its potential since the delayed start last year. Wizz has announced the launch of seven new 
routes out of Abu Dhabi for the coming weeks to Sarajevo, Odesa, Muscat, Almaty, Sohag, Baku, and Kutaisi. In 
the coming months, Alexandria, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Tirana will be added while flights out of Hungary will connect 
via Abu Dhabi instead of via Dubai from next April. 
Ukraine to be the next big market 
The next battleground will be Ukraine. Thanks to the new Open Skies agreement between the EU and Ukraine that 
was signed in October, the market is now open for more competition. Wizz will use this opportunity to base another 
seven aircraft there from summer 2022. Five additional aircraft in Kyiv bring the fleet there to eight, while Lviv will 
get two extra Airbus[3] A321neo's to get to three based aircraft. That Ukraine will become a battleground was 
confirmed by Ryanair's Michael O'Leary on November 1, when he announced that the Irish carrier will also reinforce 
its presence here. 
 Wizz Air ended the second quarter with a fleet of 144 Airbus A320ceo and neo-family aircraft, having taken delivery 
of thirteen A321neo's in this first half year and redelivered six A320neo's that had been in storage. The fleet will 
grow to 170 aircraft by September next year as it has advanced deliveries of new ones and has extended the short-
term lease of existing aircraft. The average seat count will grow to 216 next summer as more A321neo's come in 
and to 225 in FY24. 
Long-term, Varadi repeated his remarks from June that Wizz plans to grow its fleet to some 500 aircraft by the end 
of the decade. Half of them will be based in its Central East European markets, which will require further growth in 
this region. 
Wizz to recruit 2.700 new staff to prepare for growth 
To prevent any short-staffing issues in Q1 and Q2 from happening again and to prepare for growth, the carrier has 
started rehiring cockpit and cabin crew after laying of twenty percent in March 2020. It wants to bring its workforce 
to 6.700 next summer, more than the 5.000 it had at the high point in 2019 and 4.000 at the low point during the 
pandemic. 
Varadi said that it is more difficult to attract cabin crew than pilots as they have more options elsewhere, but the 
carrier succeeded in hiring 800 cabin crew in the past months. It has reinstated seventy percent of the 300 pilots 
that were laid off at the start of the pandemic. Wizz continues to organize its workforce through its own contract 
model instead of through union representation as it thinks this suits it best. 
 Despite a strong Q2, Wizz's results will remain under pressure in HY2. The expected Q3 loss of €200 million, 
which compares to €-142 million last year, is driven by three factors, said CFO Jourik Hooghe. First, the overall 
trading environment with very short bookings requires price stimulation but lowers revenues per seat kilometer. 
Second, a headwind in a volatile commodity market. And third, the suboptimal productivity of its fleet and crew with 
higher crew costs per kilometer. This makes the current FY22 a year of transition, but from spring 2022 (FY23), 
Wizz should be fully ramped up and operate at peak levels 'to make sure we deliver fifty percent growth compared 
to pre-pandemic levels', said Varadi.

Nov 04, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 The two countries have signed a series of agreements to further integrate their economies, power sector and 
taxation systems. The measures come after the EU tightened sanctions on Belarus earlier this year.Russian 
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday gave embattled Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko his backing against 
foreign "interference" during a virtual meeting aiming to move the two countries closer together. 
Putin hailed the "brotherly" ties between Russia and Belarus in a TV address after the two leaders signed a new 
package of measures in areas ranging from energy to defense. 
What were the latest talks about? 
Thursday's agreements saw Belarus and Russia align on areas of taxation, banking, industry and agriculture. 
They followed a deal reached in September to work together on 28 programs that moved toward a decades-old 
plan for a "union state" between the former Soviet Union members. 
"We will together resist any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of our sovereign states and Russia will of 
course continue to provide assistance to the brotherly Belarusian people — there is no doubt about that," Putin 
said.  
"We are striving to do everything to keep it that way forever, based on the will of our countries for unity," he added. 
Although the Eastern European partners did not discuss parliamentary or currency integration, the talks give 
Lukashenko a major boost amid tough EU sanctions imposed earlier this year. 
Why is Belarus moving closer to Russia? 
The EU clamped down on Lukashenko after he launched a ruthless crackdown on opponents to his almost 30-year 
regime. His government has jailed thousands of protesters who accused Lukashenko of rigging a 2020 election, 
even grounding a Ryanair plane to arrest a dissident blogger. 
Belarus opposition members have criticized the package of new measures.  
"In 2020 our people denied authorization for Lukashenko to sign anything on their behalf," opposition leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. 
The EU has accused Lukashenko of luring migrants from Africa and the Middle East before pushing them across 
the borders of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in recent months as payback for the bloc's sanctions. 
Russia 's Putin backs 'brotherly' Belarus amid EU pressure
The situation has caused a humanitarian crisis along the EU's eastern border, with migrants forced to sleep in 
forests besieged by EU and Belarusian border guards.

Nov 04, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] October 2021 traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 11.3 million as air-
travel demand continues to recover in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) 
in the period was 84% compared with 73% in October 2020. The airline operated more than 71,500 flights last 
month. 
Ryanair's October traffic also shows a sequential improvement of 6.6%. October's load factor is also an 
improvement from 81% in September. 
Despite improving from the pandemic-driven lows, Ryanair's traffic continues to be significantly below the pre-
pandemic levels. The airline's October 2021 traffic declined 18% from the comparable period in 2019. 
Ryanair recently reported its second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2021) financial numbers. The carrier's 
earnings of $1.16 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80. Quarterly revenues of $2,104 
million also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,338.8 million. However, the top line increased 
significantly year over year with improvement in traffic, thanks to the rollout of the EU Digital Covid Certificates, 
which facilitate travel with the European Union during the pandemic. The easing of coronavirus-led travel 
restrictions also drove traffic. 
Amid softness in travel demand from the pre-pandemic levels, U.S. airlines such as United Airlines UAL[2], 
Southwest Airlines LUV[3] and Spirit Airlines SAVE[4] have incurred losses in the third quarter of 2021. 
Nevertheless, their third-quarter performances show significant improvement on a year-over-year basis, thanks to 
easing coronavirus-led restrictions and uptick in air-travel demand from the pandemic-led lows.

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - November 4, 2021 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Costco Wholesale Corporation COST[1], 
QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM[2], Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT[3], Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ICE[4] and 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[5]. Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Costco, 
Qualcomm and Applied Materials The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. 
Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Costco, Qualcomm, and 
Applied Materials. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our 
analyst team today. 
You can seeall of today's research reports here  > > >[6] 
Shares ofCostcohave outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past three-month period 
(+14.3% vs. +4.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company's growth strategies, better price management, 
decent membership trend and increasing penetration of e-commerce business reinforce its position. The strategy to 
sell products at discounted prices has helped draw customers seeking both value and convenience. These factors 
have been aiding in registering impressive sales and earnings numbers. 
Costco put up a decent performance in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. While the top line missed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate, the bottom line marked the second straight beat. Both the metrics grew year over year. Also, Costco 
maintained a stellar comps run. While aforementioned factors raise optimism, supply chain bottlenecks and higher 
labor and freight costs remain concerns. 
(You canread the full research report on Costco here  > > >[7]) 
Shares ofQualcommhave underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+4.8% vs. 
+18.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that Qualcomm is likely to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater long-term 
visibility. The chipmaker anticipates witnessing healthy growth momentum, driven by the ramp-up in 5G-enabled 
chips and higher demand for digital transformation in the cloud economy. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Costco , Qualcomm , Applied Materials , Intercontinental Exchange and

However, high research and development costs are likely to strain its margins. Severe competition from major 
players, huge concentration risks, and softness in demand from China might impair its growth potential. Global chip 
shortage in the semiconductor industry as a result of supply-chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic is a 
major headwind. 
(You canread the full research report on QUALCOMM here  > > >[8]) 
Shares ofApplied Materialshave outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry 
over the past year (+117.7% vs. +99.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that Applied Materials is benefiting from 
strong momentum across Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services. Further, solid demand for silicon in 
several applications across various markets remains a tailwind. Additionally, growing usage of OLED technology in 
smartphones, televisions and computers, remained positive. 
Furthermore, increased customer spending in foundry and logic on the back of rising need for specialty nodes in 
automotive, power, 5G rollout, IoT, communications and image sensor markets, is a major positive. Also, strong 
momentum in conductor etches is benefiting the company's position in DRAM and NAND. Moreover, the company 
remains optimistic about increasing DRAM spending. However, mounting expenses and rising market competition 
remain overhangs.

Nov 03, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, U.S. carriers, such as SkyWest SKYW[1], Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] and Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[3] released their respective third-quarter 2021 earnings reports. European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[4] also grabbed headlines on the earnings front, releasing its second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 
2021) earnings report. While the top line benefited from increased traffic at all the above carriers, high fuel price per 
gallon hurt the bottom line. 
We remind investors that the third-quarter earnings reports of the likes of Southwest Airlines LUV[5] and American 
Airlines AAL[6] were discussed in detail in the previous week's write up[7]. On the non-earnings front, JetBlue 
Airways' JBLU[8] decision to expand its codeshare agreement with Iceland's Icelandair dominated headlines. 
Recap of the Latest Key Events 1. SkyWest's third-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding $1.26 from non-recurring 
items) of $1.45 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. The bottom line increased 
significantly on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the recovery in air-travel demand. Revenues of $744.8 million also 
outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674 million. The top line jumped 63% year over year owing to a 
67% increase in block hours on completed flights[9]. 
SkyWest currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[10]. 
2. Spirit Airlines' third-quarter 2021 loss (excluding 83 cents from non-recurring items) of 69 cents per share was 
narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 95 cents and the year-ago loss of $2.32. Operating 
revenues of $922.6 million increased in excess of 100% year over year. This massive year-over-year jump reflects 
improving air-travel demand as COVID-19 cases fall and the threat of the Delta variant recedes in the United 
States. Revenues increased 7.4%, sequentially. Average fuel cost per gallon in the September quarter rose to 
$2.14 from $1.27 as oil price shoots up[11]. 
3. Allegiant's third-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding $1.52 from non-recurring items) of 66 cents per share missed 
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. However, the bottom line surged more than 100% on a year-over-year 
basis. Sentiments regarding air-travel demand are bullish now (owing to increased inoculation programs) compared 
with the year-ago quarter when the company reported a loss of $4.28 per share. Operating revenues of $459.5 
Airline Stock Roundup: Q3 Earnings Results From ALGT, SKYW & SAVE , JBLU in Focus
million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $446.1 million and increased more than 100% on a year-over-year 
basis. Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) surged 66.7% to $2.20 in the quarter[12]. 
4. Ryanair reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2021) earnings of $1.16 per share, which fell short 
of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80. In the year-ago period, the company incurred an adjusted loss of 12 
cents per share due to coronavirus-led weakness in air-travel demand. Quarterly revenues of $2,104 million in the 
second quarter of fiscal 2022 fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,338.8 million. The top line increased 
significantly year over year with improvement in traffic, courtesy of the rollout of the EU Digital Covid Certificates. 
Easing of coronavirus-led travel restrictions also drove traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased 67% 
year over year, partly due to higher jet fuel prices[13]. 
5. In a bid to boost connectivity, JetBlue expanded its codeshare deal with Icelandair. The agreement offers 
customers multiple ways to book and connect their travel between JetBlue and Icelandair's networks across Europe 
and North America. A codeshare deal enables flight sharing, by dint of which a passenger has the free will to avail 
any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement, irrespective of the flight number. With 
international travel demand gradually rising as countries reopen their borders to vaccinated travelers, the expanded 
codeshare agreement should help drive traffic for JetBlue. 
 Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double" 
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround. 
Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent 
Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and 
Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up  > >[15]

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported second-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2021) earnings of $1.16 per 
share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80. In the year-ago period, the company incurred 
adjusted loss of 12 cents per share due to coronavirus-led weakness in air-travel demand. 
Quarterly revenues of $2,104 million also fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,338.8 million. The top line 
increased significantly year over year with improvement in traffic, thanks to the rollout of the EU Digital Covid 
Certificates, which facilitate travel with the European Union during the pandemic. Easing of coronavirus-led travel 
restrictions also drove traffic. 
Ryanair's profit for the quarter came in at €225 million against the year-ago quarter's loss of €225.5 million. Traffic 
soared 86% year over year to 31 million. Load factor in the period was consistently above 80%. Ryanair Holdings

surprise-chart[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] 
 Scheduled revenues climbed 57% year over year due to surge in traffic. Ancillary revenues jumped 95% year over 
year in the reported quarter due to strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating, apart from robust 
traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by 67% year over year due to rise in sectors flown and higher 
jet fuel prices. Total operating expenses rose 47% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), had 
cash of €4.24 billion as of Sep 30, 2021, higher than €3.15 billion as of Mar 31, 2021.You can see the complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[4]. 
For fiscal 2022, the company expects to record a loss of €100-€200 million. 
On a separate note, Ryanair said that it was considering delisting itself from the London Stock Exchange as its 
trading volumes have 'reduced materially during 2021'. Performance of Other Airlines United Airlines UAL[5], 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding $2.46 from non-recurring items) of $1.02 per share in the third 
quarter of 2021, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.65. Operating revenues of $7,750 
million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7639.7 million.

 Ryanair[1] benefitted from a strong Q2 to record a €225 million profit compared to a €225.5 million loss last year. 
However, its half-year result produced a €47.6 million loss. The airline's results remain under pressure as yields are 
low and the low-cost carrier needs to offer tickets at reduced prices to stimulate demand. This trend makes that 
Ryanair is up for a challenging winter season. 
 Besides the Q2 €225 million net profit, the operating profit was €254 million versus just €10.8 million for the June-
September quarter last year. Total revenues were €1.784 billion, with ancillary revenues again performing strongly 
from €360.9 million last year to €703 million this Q3. 
 On the back of a weak Q1 with a net loss of €243 million[2], Ryanair produced a net loss between April and 
September of €47.6 million. This compares to €-410.5 million in 2020. The operating loss for HY1 was €50.5 million 
compared to €-176.8 million. Revenues ended at €2.154 billion versus €1.176 billion. 
 Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the first six months of its financial year 2022, compared to 17.1 million in 
the same period last year. Q1 was impacted by travel restrictions and, as a result, many cancelations around 
Easter. Q2 was much better as demand increased and traveling became easier thanks to the Digital Covid 
Certificate in July. But as in Q1, bookings remained close-in and Ryanair needed price stimulation with reduced 
fares to stimulate demand. Load factors were on average 79 percent in HY1 but consistently over eighty percent 
from July onwards. 
Demand needs further price stimulation 
While October and Christmas bookings are strong, Michael O'Leary said that the visibility of the winter 2022 season 
remains low. Yields and ticket prices continue to be challenging. Another factor is rising fuel prices. Ryanair has 
hedged only seventy percent of fuel in HY2 and eighty percent for HY1 FY23. With the uncertainties of the Covid-
crisis in mind when it had to ground its fleet against huge hedging losses, Ryanair didn't want to hedge at 90-95 
percent anymore. Instead, it is preferring fuel swaps and modest use of caps. These caps are for $62-72 per barrel, 
well below the current $80. However, this could pose a risk if fuel prices remain high next year. 
 Ryanair is expecting to end FY22 with a low 100 million in passengers carried, up from its previous guidance of 90-
100 million but lower than the 80-120 million that was announced earlier this year. The net loss should be 'a modest 
€100 to €200 million' but only if the roll-out of vaccinations continues and no new Covid-cases emerge. 
Ryanair up for challenging winter season
 'We work hard to rebuild load factors. In fact, we are already well over eighty percent and see ourselves back at 
over ninety percent in the summer of 2022. But outside of these peak periods like November, the second half of 
January, the first half of February, yields will be tough. We will be engaging a lot of price discounting to get people 
back moving and restore confidence into the intra-EU air travel', O'Leary said. 
 During HY1, Ryanair announced over 560 new routes as part of the 2.400 routes offered and opened fourteen new 
bases. The carrier agreed on new base deals with eleven airports and signed long-term extensions with five 
airports, including London Stansted, Manchester, East Midlands, Charleroi (Belgium), and Bergamo (Italy). For 
summer 2022, the carrier will open new bases in Cork, Newcastle, Venice, and Vienna. At the Austrian capital, 
Ryanair will base eleven aircraft 'as both Wizz Air and Austrian are in retreat.' The strengthening of Vienna fills the 
void left after plans to build Vienna into a strong hub for its subsidiary Lauda collapsed in 2019. 
 Italy will also become even more important, with 21 extra aircraft based at seven airports in the country 'to ensure 
that airfares to and from Italy remain low, even as Alitalia (ITA Airways) has its capacity.' Ryanair will also add more 
capacity to Portugal, Poland, and Ireland, its home country being stimulated by demand and lower airport charges. 
Ukraine is set to become an important market next year.

Growth to 225 million passengers in 2026 
At its recent annual general meeting, Ryanair adopted a revised strategy that targets aggressive growth for the next 
five years. Instead of going for 200 million passengers in March 2026, it has now upped its game to get to 225 
million passengers. This compares to 149 million in 2019. Ryanair sees an opportunity for this extra growth as other 
carriers have planned a reduction in capacity while various countries like Ireland, Italy, and Morocco are stimulating 
tourism to restore traffic. To cater to this demand, the carrier will hire 5.000 employees over the next five years to 
staff its rapidly growing fleet. 
 Ryanair will take delivery of 210 Boeing[3] MAX 8200s through 2026. It has now eight in service and expects to 
grow this number to 65 by next summer. Although load factors are not high enough to benefit from the four percent 
higher seat capacity of the 8200 over the 737-800, O'Leary is satisfied with the reliability, fuel consumption, and 
customer feedback of the MAX. The airline sold ten 737-800s of the oldest in Q2, with eight of them to be retired by 
the summer of next year. 
'Boeing needs to come back to the table' 
On thefailed negotiations[4] on a MAX 10 order after Boeing raised aircraft prices, O'Leary said that 'Boeing needs 
to come back to the table. They need an order from Ryanair. But frankly, we have enough aircraft for the next four 
to five years. We will wait until Boeing gets competitive on pricing again before we place another order. () Boeing is 
losing customers all over the place and the one large customer they have outside North America, Ryanair, was very 
close in active negotiations for the MAX 10. But Boeing walked away from discussions. They were looking for a 
price increase at a time when prices should be falling if Boeing is to recover its production.' He referred to Jet2's 
decision to opt for the Airbus[5] A320neo for the same reason and also mentioned IAG, which according to O'Leary 
has walked away from an order for 200 MAX (announced at the 2019 Paris Airshow as a Letter of Intent) in favor of 
Airbus. 
 Ryanair ended September with €4.24 billion in cash. Adding assets of €7.6 billion of its ninety percent 
unencumbered fleet makes €14.07 billion in total. The carrier issued a €1.2 billion unsecured bond in May while 
repaying an €860 million 2014 loan in June and a 600 million 'Covid loan' to the UK in late October. The net debt 
stood at €1.5 billion. Capital expenditure for FY22 will be around €1.2 billion including maintenance and €2.3 billion 
in FY23. It will finance its existing MAX order from its balance sheet and high credit rating but likely also by issuing 
new bonds, doing sales and leasebacks, and through so-called Jolco financing deals.

Oct 19, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 The former military airstrip turned commercial airport maintains a busy freight business, but it has been losing 
passengers since before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, located 120 kilometers (75 
miles) northwest of Frankfurt in the Hunsrück region of the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, filed for 
bankruptcy Tuesday. 
What do we know so far? 
According to Operating Manager Christoph Goetzmann, papers were filed at the Bad Kreuznach Administrative 
Court. The court has appointed Frankfurter lawyer Jan Markus Plathner provisional administrator while the 
company is in receivership. 
The airport's biggest investor, the Chinese HNA Group, purchased 82.5% of the business from the state of 
Rhineland-Palatinate for €15 million ($17.5 million) in 2017. The remaining 17.5% belongs to the neighboring 
western German state of Hesse. 
HNA has made headlines of late, including a bankruptcy announcement earlier in the year and most recently when 
Chairman Chen Feng and CEO Tan Xiangdong were both arrested in late September. Airport representatives in 
Hahn very recently said the arrests would not affect operations. 
Why has the Frankfurt-Hahn airport struggled financially? 
Although the coronavirus pandemic has brought an uptick of freight business to the former US military airstrip, the 
site began losing passenger business long before that. Originally a major hub for Ryanair, Hahn has suffered as the 
Irish discount flyer has increasingly taken its business to larger airports nearby.  
The business has long suffered financial instability, piling up debt and counting on government subsidies to keep it 
solvent.  
Operating Manager Goetzmann said that despite not needing government assistance nor having to cut workers' 
hours during the pandemic, the company still expects to register losses for its fiscal year 2020 financial report. 
Management at Hahn had nevertheless recently said it expected operations to be profitable by 2024, when EU law 
will prohibit airports from receiving government subsidies.

Oct 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] inked a deal with Aemetis (AMTX) for 250 million gallons of blended fuel 
containing sustainable aviation fuel, which is to be delivered over a period of 10 years. The estimated value of the 
agreement with the renewable fuels company is more than $1 billion. The deal[2] is in line with the objective to 
reduce carbon emissions. 
Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] subsidiary Alaska Airlines dominated headlines by virtue of its codeshare agreement with 
the Spanish carrier Iberia Airlines, which expanded its network. European carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] 
September traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 1.6 million on the back of improving air-travel demand 
in Europe. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Per aReuters report[5],Delta'smanagement said that 
the airline's ticket sales stabilized and began to improve. This induces a drop in the bookings due to a spike in 
coronavirus cases induced by the Delta variant. The carrier now expects third-quarter 2021 revenues to fall within 
its initial guidance of a decline of 30-35% from the comparable period's reading in 2019, per the report. Due to 
rising coronavirus cases, Delta previously estimated total adjusted revenues at the lower end of the guided range. 
Per the report, chief executive officer ED Bastian told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of the airlines group 
IATA that "For Delta, they bottomed out in the later part of August and the first part of September.' Bastian further 
added, "Business traffic is growing back in the U.S." Business-travel demand persists to be rather slower in 
recovery than leisure-travel demand. 
Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), currently. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. Per Alaska Airlines' agreement with Iberia Airlines, passengers of the Spanish carrier can book travel and 
connect to several routes across Alaska Airlines' network and vice versa, beginning Oct 7. Alaska Airlines 
customers will have easy access to international destinations in Europe, given Iberia's existing nonstop service 
between Los Angeles and Madrid, and a seasonal service between San Francisco, CA and Barcelona. According to 
the deal, Alaska Airlines' Mileage Plan members can earn miles on the Iberia flights. The agreement also offers 
reciprocal elite benefits, such as preferred seat selection; priority check-in, security clearance and boarding; lounge 
access and an extra baggage allowance. Iberia Airlines is a member of the oneworld alliance. 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL 's Environmentally-Friendly Deal, RYAAY's Traffic & More
3. On the back of the improving traffic scenario, Ryanair's September load factor (percentage of seats filled with 
passengers) increased to 81% from 71% in September 2020. The airline operated more than 69,500 flights last 
month. Despite improving from the pandemic-triggered lows, Ryanair's traffic continues to be significantly below the 
pre-pandemic levels. The airline's September 2021 traffic declined 24.8% from the comparable period's tally in 
2019[7]. 
Ryanair's traffic in October is also expected to be high (exceeding 10.5 million) per CEO Michael O'Leary, which 
was mentioned in the previous week's write up[8]. 
4. Southwest Airlines LUV[9] mandated COVID-19 vaccines for all its employees by Dec 8, 2021, in compliance 
with President Joe Biden's vaccination directive for federal contractors. The Dallas-based carrier announced that its 
contracts with the U.S. government require the company to fully comply with the federal vaccination directive. The 
company informed that its employees need to be either fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or granted an exemption 
on religious, medical or disability grounds to continue their employment with the carrier[10]. 
5. September traffic at Gol Linhas GOL[11] moved up marginally on a month-over-month basis. In the same time 
frame, capacity measured in available seat kilometers rose 2.1%. Since traffic surge was less than capacity 
expansion, load factor dipped 1.1 percentage points (p.p) from August levels to 79.1%. On a year-over-year basis, 
traffic surged 36.8% in September. In the same time frame, capacity expanded 38.1%. Since traffic surge was less 
than capacity growth, load factor decreased 0.8 p.p to 79.1% from the year-ago period's levels. Gol Linhas' total 
monthly departures surged 51.7% and seats rose 51.1%. Gol Linhas transported 1.6 million passengers in 
September (up 47.8% on a year-over-year basis). The Latin America-based airline did not operate international 
flights during September. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week although the gains were 
muted in nature. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has inched up 1.7% to $98.85 in the period. Over the course of the 
past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has depreciated 9%. 
 What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will await the third-quarter 2021 earnings report of Delta Air Lines. The 
airline is scheduled to release September-quarter results on Oct 13.

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] September 2021 traffic surged more than 100% year over year to 10.6 million as air-
travel demand continues to recover in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) 
in the period was 81% compared with 71% in September 2020. The airline operated more than 69,500 flights last 
month. 
Amid the prevalent pandemic, Ryanair's September traffic, however, fell 4.5% sequentially. Load factor also 
deteriorated 100 basis points from August. 
Despite improving from the pandemic-driven lows, Ryanair's traffic continues to be significantly below the pre-
pandemic levels. The airline's September 2021 traffic declined 24.8% from the comparable period in 2019. Ryanair

five-year traffic growth forecast as it expects to take delivery of 210 Boeing 737 aircraft over the next five years. 
Ryanair increased its five-year traffic growth projection to 50% from 33% expected earlier. The carrier expects 
traffic to grow to more than 225 million guests per year by March 2026, compared with 200 million predicted earlier.

Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies

 Mighty Wings! 
Great Ones, can Boeing (NYSE: BAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=ba&#38;checkSymbol=true) take me 
high enough? To fly me over yesterday? 
 Don't tell me, I know this Damn Yankees? 
 Ding ding! If it's not Mr. Mister with 'Broken Wings,' you know 'High Enough' is pretty much my other default song 
every time Boeing comes up 
https://research.banyanhill.com/X190X142 
First things first: What's up with Boeing? 
 Several factoids, several lil' newsworthy nuggets, sent BA 4% higher yesterday. But yesterday's rally was just a 
memory — just a memory — and BA came crashing down 2% today. 
 Yesterday, Bernstein Analyst Douglas Harned upgraded Boeing stock to outperform[1]. (I thought the Bernsteins 
were bears, not bulls? Hmm.) Harned also raised his price target from $252 to $279[2], optimistic that air travel will 
tick up and improve over the next few months. 
 Of course, this is barring any new COVID-19 variants emerging, which analysts in their infinite wisdom 'do not 
expect.' I'd say that's a pretty big variable to not expect or plan for, but let's back-burner the pandemic for a sec, if 
that's possible. 
 There's more greatness coming from BA today — out of China, no less! 
 Boeing's 737 MAX just finished a successful and safe test flight for China's aviation regulator. The beleaguered 
Boeing design is one step closer to final approval for China's skies, and Boeing hopes the 737 MAX may fly again 
by year's end. Hoorah, hooray. 
 Things ain't too shabby stateside either: Boeing just won a $23.8 billion follow-up contract[3] with the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) to service a fleet of 275 C-17 Globemaster IIIs over the next decade. 
 Sure, some cheapskate airlines balked at Boeing's prices — cough Ryanair cough[4] — but you bet the DoD 
already has its checkbook at the ready. 
Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies
 All told, BA rallied 4% as the laundry list of news items unfurled yesterday, ending in a hangover today as BA 
slipped 2%. But why? We've got great news from Boeing, and clearly, some BA investors cheered the DoD/China 
news. What gives? 
The first and most obvious reason why Boeing is down today is because it was up yesterday. Any positivity about 
Boeing can't last longer than a few hours, it seems. And like I said with the Ryanair rant-fest, BA is everybody's 
whipping boy these days. 
 But the other reason why BA sank lower today is because, as positive analysts might be about the return of air 
traffic, travelers are only half the equation for Boeing. Airlines have quite a bit to do with how soon Boeing can take 
off from here. Oh yeah, they exist. 
 And as the analysts at Bernstein put it: 'The story is not totally clean.' 
 We're in a spot where airlines are dealing with increasing air traffic and need new planes but they're still facing a 
balance sheet disaster — some airlines worse than others. That kinda happens when you spend the pandemic 
retiring older planes and then selling others for quick cash. 
 Airlines will continue to try to upgrade and update their fleets while also cutting debt and minimizing cash burn. You 
throw in a little interest rate worrying and your typical inflation concerns, and financing a bunch of new planes 
suddenly gets a bit trickier. 
 Such is the balancing act airlines must play now. They will need Boeing for more planes to keep up with increasing 
air traffic — this much is true. 
 Thing is, Boeing's found itself in the same holding pattern many a time before. Sent airborne by uplifting news and 
dashing back down into the tarmac when Negative Nancies chime in. Don't believe me? Back on November 18, 
2020[5] — before Great Stuff Picks even recommended the stock — we said: 
With the FAA's clearance, Boeing can ramp up 737 MAX production rates again to meet existing and future orders. 
The pandemic won't be around forever. Demand for airplanes will rise again, and Boeing's path forward was just 
cleared. 
Sounds familiar, no? With new clearance (hopefully) coming soon in China, the company can ramp up production 
again, deliver more of its existing inventory to the airlines and keep on keeping on. 
Boeing's been here before. We've been here before as BA investors. Boeing will be OK. (We'll be OK too, for what 
it's worth.) 
 Domestic airlines will figure out what the heck to do with their fleets. And getting the 737 MAX back airborne in 
China would do wonders on Boeing's international sales front. 
 So same as it ever was? 
 Same as it ever was, Great Ones. The bottom line you need to remember, especially if you're holding BA is this: 
Boeing can and will take us high enough eventually. 
 The variable in question these days is less about regulatory holdups with the 737 MAX (the 787 Dreamliner we'll 
get to another day) and more about airlines ponying up enough cash to buy, buy, buy. 
 As such, today's minute drop in BA stock is nothing to worry or write home about. If anything, the market just 
offered you yet another opportunity to snatch up BA stock on the cheap. Lucky you! 
 That said, you should write home to us here in the inbox. Let me know if you're saying goodnight to holding BA, or 
if you'd live and die for the OG planemaker over at GreatStuffToday@BanyanHill.com [6].; 
 Editor's Note: Biggest Investment Opportunity Since The Internet Boom? 
 Research suggests that 916 of the Fortune 1000 companies are rushing to invest in the biggest tech opportunity of 
this century[7]. 
 Ian King calls this technology 'Digitarium.' Right now, hardly anyone knows about this trend, but mark my words: In 
just a few short years, Digitarium will become as common as the internet. 
 And there's one small company in California at the center of it all.

 Supply Chain Slip 'N Slide[9] 
Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies
 I've 
always 
wondered 
what 
the 
'beyond' 
part 
of 
Bed 
Bath 
&#38; 
Beyond 
(Nasdaq: 
BBBYhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ%3ABBBY) stood for, and now we know: 
beyond-poor earnings. 
 BBBY investors woke up with a migraine this morning after the company slashed both its revenue and earnings 
projections for the rest of the year, following disappointing fiscal second-quarter results. 
 The big-box behemoth reported a profit of $0.04 per share, missing analysts' expectations of a $0.52 per-share 
profit. Sales? Also a letdown — revenue came in at $1.99 billion versus the $2.06 billion that Wall Street 
anticipated. 
 But where did things go so horribly wrong over at Bed Bath &#38; Beyond?  
 I'm glad you asked! According to company execs, this latest earnings misfire can all be blamed on COVID-19-
induced supply chain issues and it definitely has nothing to do with its wildly overpriced inventory. 
 But wait! According to CEO Mark Tritton, this latest earnings miss isn't something that Wall Street should worry 
about long term: 'While results this quarter were below expectations, we remain confident in our multiyear 
transformation.' 
 I mean, what else is Tritton going to say? Business is down because no one wants to pay $50 for a shower caddy 
that Target sells for half the price? Nah It's much easier to blame Wall Street's favorite scapegoat: COVID-19. At 
least, that's Bed Bath &#38; Beyond's story and it's sticking to it. 
 CarMaxed Out[10] 
 There 
are 
plenty 
of 
reasons 
why 
CarMax 
(NYSE: 
KMXhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NYSE%3AKMX) made it onto our shortlist of Great Stuff 
Picks: No-pressure car searching, no hidden fees, an impressive omnichannel that makes it easy to buy cars online 
as well as in person. The list goes on. 
 Unfortunately, come earnings season, Wall Street's expectations are the only thing that really matter. And this 
quarter, Wall Street didn't get the news it wanted despite CarMax's strong sales growth. Here's a quick rundown of 
CarMax's recent performance: 
 Net revenue came in at $8 billion, up 48.7% compared to this time last year. Wholesale units increased 41.4% to 
188,098 vehicles, also up from the year prior. Used-car sales increased 6.7%, up from 6.2% a year ago. 
 Well then, what gives? All that sounds pretty good to me!  
 As it should. The real sticking point were those pesky per-share earnings. Wall Street wanted earnings of $1.87 a 
share, and instead, it got $1.72 per share. So, weak-handed KMX investors had a fit and threw the baby out with 
the bathwater. 
 But here's the thing: People are already hooked on the haggle-free car-buying experience that companies like 
CarMax and Carvana (NYSE: CVNAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=CVNA&#38;checkSymbol=false) 
provide. That was true before the COVID-19 pandemic, and it will remain true once life gets back to normal 
whenever that is. 
 No offense to any of you used-car salesmen (salespeople?) out there, but I'll scour the onlines for a new car any 
day of the week over traipsing through a labyrinthian car lot. And no, I will not upgrade to the all-weather floor mats, 
thank you very much. 
 We get it. You like CarMax. Get to the point.  
 The point is this: Any of you Great Ones looking to add KMX stock to your portfolio can view today's 10% stock 
decline as a buying opportunity. If you already own CarMax, keep holding. How's that for brevity? 
Virgin Victorious?[11] 
 The billionaire space race will undoubtedly heat up again now that Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic (NYSE: 
SPCEhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NYSE%3ASPCE) has been cleared for takeoff by the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
 If you haven't kept up with Branson's almost-a-spaceflight company, Virgin Galactic found itself in hot water with 
the FAA back on July 11 after its Unity 22 rocket veered off course in its final descent back down to Earth. 
 The problem wasn't so much the deviation itself — you try slinging a 15,800-pound rocket into 'space' and see if it 
sticks a perfect landing — but rather that Virgin Galactic failed to report said deviation to the FAA. 
 It's kinda like when one of your kids swears they didn't draw on the bathroom wall in permanent marker even 
though they've got black ink smudges all over their hands and clothes. Same maturity level, very different 
repercussions. 
Boeing 's Balancing Act, Virgin Galactic Flies While Lordstown Slowly Dies
 But after being grounded for the better part of a month, Virgin Galactic made peace with the FAA and promised to 
provide 'real-time mission notifications' during future flights. Because somehow that wasn't a requirement in the first 
place 
 Anyway, SPCE investors rejoiced over the news that their beloved Branson spacecrafts could take to the stars 
once more. Virgin Galactic stock rocketed 12% higher today, proving once again that investor sentiment remains 
the No. 1 mover of stock prices — and not things like future profitability or revenue growth. 
 As we pointed out back in May[12], Virgin Galactic already has 600 reservations lined up from wannabe astronauts 
eager to see space. But each of those reservations is already paid for so where is the future revenue supposed to 
come from? Until that profitability is accounted for, we'll continue giving Virgin Galactic a wide berth. 
 Lordstown's Lucky Strike[13] 
 Electric 
pickup 
truck 
maker 
Lordstown 
Motors 
(Nasdaq: 
RIDEhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ%3ARIDE) showed signs of life this morning 
after rumors circulated that Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group might acquire its sole Ohio-based electric vehicle 
(EV) factory. 
 The buyout is a boon to unlucky Lordstown, which is still struggling to raise enough cash to produce its first all-
electric pickup truck, the 'Endurance.' 
 Ah yes, here comes a witty Lordstown joke about the company lacking the endurance to make the Endurance.  
 You know us too well. Putting aside Lordstown's recent financial troubles, the company's also faced scrutiny from 
the SEC over its summertime SPAC merger with blank check company DiamondPeak Holding Corp. 
 Apparently, ex-CEO Steve Burns lied about how many orders Lordstown received for the Endurance before going 
public, as well as where those orders came from. Not great, Bob![14] 
 While Foxconn's buyout may help Lordstown's lackeys in the interim, there's no telling whether the move will be 
enough to save Lordstown from the gallows. So if rising RIDE shares piqued your interest this morning, keep one 
hand on the emergency brake and prepare for a quick getaway. 
 In other EV news the surge in EV demand is also creating a surge in the materials critical to having these EVs 
come off the assembly line. 
 There's only one company in the entire Western Hemisphere that supplies this critical material on such a large 
scale. And as EVs take over roadways all across America they will rely on this material for future success.

Advertising watchdog to launch crackdown on ads falsely claiming green credentials
Advertising watchdog to launch crackdown on ads falsely claiming green

 Airline ads that encourage taking too many flights and carmakers that show SUVs tearing up the countryside are 
set to fall foul of a crackdown on marketing that encourages environmentally irresponsible behaviour. 
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is to launch a series of inquiries into the environmental advertising 
claims and practices across a range of sectors - starting with energy, heating and transport - in a drive to support 
global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and battle the climate crisis. 
 Next spring the the watchdog will expand its investigation to look at the accuracy of green claims made by 
companies around waste, such as products being biodegradable, recyclable or a 'plastic alternative'. Later next 
year the spotlight will turn to meat and food sustainability advertising, for example checking the accuracy of claims 
around environmental good practice by sellers of beef products, a hugely carbon intensive industry. 
 'The ASA is going to be shining a greater regulatory spotlight in the coming years on social responsibility and 
misleadingness issues when it comes to environmental claims in ads,' says Miles Lockwood, director of complaints 
and investigations at the ASA. 
 'We know that there needs to be systemic, wide scale change in order for the UK to meet the government's climate 
targets. We know how concerned people are about ads inaccurately promoting green credentials. We believe that 
our work will continue to positively influence the fight against climate change.' 
 It will also commission research into what the public understands by terms such as 'carbon neutral' and 'net zero' in 
order to inform its policing of claims. It will examine the messaging around the meaning of 'hybrid' in the burgeoning 
electric vehicle market. 
 'We have concerns about how companies might be using 'green' terms,' said Lockwood. 'Carbon neutral in 
particular is emerging as a popular term, with lots of companies burnishing their green credentials by claiming their 
services add no carbon overall to the atmosphere. 
 'We want to better understand how companies are using terms like this across industries and how consumers 
understand these terms, so that our rules and guidance are in step with prevailing academic, scientific evidence 
and environmental standards so we're best placed to tackle misleading and socially irresponsible green claims 
across media.' 
Advertising watchdog to launch crackdown on ads falsely claiming green credentials
 The watchdog has clamped down on several major companies in recent years over their green claims in adverts, 
including Ryanair - which got caught using outdated information to claim it was the UK's lowest emission airline - 
BMW and Shell. 
 The ASA is currently investigating complaints about a Land Rover Defender advert that shows one of the vehicles 
driving through a forest accompanied by the slogan 'life is so much better without restrictions'. The complaints claim 
the advert encourages an irresponsible approach to nature and fails to mention the climate impact of SUVs. 
 Later this year, the ASA's sister body the Committee of Advertising Practice - which sets the UK advertising code 
across all forms of media, from TV and newspapers to billboards and online - will issue new guidance to advertisers 
regarding misleading and socially irresponsible environmental claims and advertising. 
 On Monday, the Competition and Markets Authority said it would launch its own review of misleading green claims 
next year.

Sep 23, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] raised its 5-year traffic growth forecast from 33% to 50%. The 
European carrier now expects traffic to grow to more than 225 million guests per year by March 2026 compared 
with 200 million predicted earlier. 
The Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[2] was also in the news in the past week when it extended its 
agreement with American Airlines AAL[3]. American Airlines will acquire a 5.2% stake in Gol Linhas. However, 
American Airlines' alliance with JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] seems to have run into rough weather with the Justice 
Department and officials in six states reportedly [5]filing a lawsuit against the alliance on antitrust grounds. Recap of 
the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1.Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects fiscal 2022 
traffic in the range of 90-100 million compared with 27.5 million guests in fiscal 2021.The carrier aims to take 
delivery of 210 Boeing 737 aircraft over the next five years. The company expects these planes, which would lower 
costs and reduce emissions, to accelerate its post-COVID growth[6]. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
2. Under this extended deal, Gol Linhas will receive an equity investment of $200 million (R$1.05 billion) from 
American Airlines. This additional liquidity is expected to strengthen Gol Linhas' balance sheet. The new agreement 
expands beyond the terms of the existing codeshare partnership (which has been in place since February 2020) 
between the carriers. As a result of the code sharing pact, passengers of either carrier can purchase tickets of the 
connecting flights using one reservation. American Airlines, through this exclusive codeshare agreement, expects to 
increase commercial cooperation with the Brazilian carrier to accelerate growth and create a more seamless 
experience for customers[8]. 
3. According to an update from the White House, travel restrictions on air passengers from countries like China, 
India, Britain and other European nations into the United States will be eased from November this year. Per White 
House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients, foreign nationals will have to be fully vaccinated when they fly to the 
United States in November. They will have to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding. Further, the 
travelers have to test negative for the coronavirus, which they have to undergo within three days of their flight. 
Zients ruled out the need to quarantine for the fully-vaccinated passengers[9]. 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Bullish View for Traffic, AAL , JBLU in Focus
The development is a major positive, especially for the Delta-variant-hit U.S. airlines. Many of the carriers expect 
third-quarter 2021 results to be dented by the spread of the Delta strain in the United States. Their bearish third-
quarter views were discussed in detail in the previous week's write-up[10]. 
4. The Justice Department believes that the alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue will reduce 
competition, leading to higher fares. Per Attorney General Merrick Garland, 'In an industry where just four airlines 
control more than 80% of domestic air travel, American Airlines' alliance with JetBlue is, in fact, an unprecedented 
manoeuvre to further consolidate the industry." 
American and JetBlue vowed to fight the lawsuit and continue with their alliance unless directed otherwise by a 
court. The partnership was announced last year. JetBlue and American Airlines already started coordinating on 
flights in the Northeast. Garland is, however, of the view that 'It would result in higher fares, fewer choices, and 
lower quality service if allowed to continue.' 
5. United Airlines UAL[11] is expanding its footprint in Africa with a new service between Washington, D.C. and 
Lagos, Nigeria, set to be launched on Nov 29, subject to government approval. The airline will operate three weekly 
flights between the U.S. capital and the popular African destination. This is the company's first ever nonstop service 
between Washington, D.C. and Nigeria[12]. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of 
the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that the airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week, aided by the 
announcement from the White House pertaining to the easing of international travel curbs. The NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has increased 3.5% over the past week to $94.23. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has 
decreased 6.6%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will await more updates on the American Airlines-
JetBlue partnership in the coming days.

 Despite fears around the future of aviation and international travel Ryaniar announces big plans and investments 
over the next five years. 
 Subject to no adverse Covid developments, and vaccinations remaining at above 90 per cent across Europe, 
Ryanair will take delivery of 210 B737 Gamechanger aircraft over the next five years. 
 According to Ryanair, these new planes deliver industry lowest costs, reduced emissions, and will enable Ryanair 
accelerate its post-Covid growth, as opportunities open up at primary and secondary airports all over Europe, 
particularly where legacy carriers have failed or reduced fleet sizes as a result of Covid and State Aid. 
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'With these new deliveries, Ryanair will open 10 new bases across Europe this 
year as we work with airport partners to help them recover traffic &#38; jobs post Covid, and take up slot 
opportunities that are being vacated by competitor airlines who have collapsed or significantly reduced their fleet 
sizes. 
 On jobs, Mr O'Leary added: 'Ryanair expects to create over 5,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers 
over the next 5 years, and the Group is excited to have, earlier this week, opened a €50m Aviation Training Centre 
in Dublin, with 2 further high quality training centres planned for Spain and Poland over the next 5 years.' 
 In addition, Ryanair's pre-Covid traffic of 149m is expected to grow to over 225m guests by March 2026, which is 
25m passengers p.a. higher than the previous target of 200m.

 The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada and Switzerland have adopted or expanded 
sanctions against Belarus, and the Alexander Lukashenko regime. 
President Biden issued a new executive order that expanded U.S. sanctions authority against Belarus, authorizing 
the designation of government officials, oligarchs and various companies linked to the Lukashenko regime[1]. The 
expanded sanctions authority now encompasses various sectors, including defense, energy, security, 
transportation, cigarette manufacturing, and construction. OFAC expects to implement a broad set of sanctions 
across the Belarus economy[2]. 
The United Kingdom also imposed restrictions including prohibitions on technology, software, dual-use goods, oil 
and gas and tobacco products. The UK prohibitions apply in the territory of UK and all UK persons and companies 
wherever located[3]. 
The EU imposed new restrictions on aviation, and prohibitions on trade in technology items, including artificial 
intelligence and software products.[4] Earlier in the summer, the EU adopted a broad range of sectoral sanctions 
against Belarus. 
Canada adopted revised sanctions relating to securities, money market instruments, debt and various financial 
transactions, along with a robust set of restrictions on oil and gas products. 
Finally, Switzerland introduced new trade prohibitions in the financial sector and products used to monitor internet 
and telephone communications. 
United States and Global Community Adopt Broad Sanctions Targeting Belarus (Part III of IV)
OFAC took immediate steps under the new executive order to sanction 23 individuals and 21 entities, many of 
whom were involved in the crackdown on protesters after last year's disputed election and the government's forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight in May. OFAC announced the new sanctions by stressing that the action was 
unprecedented in scope against Belarus. 
OFAC's sanctions specifically target oligarchs connected to Lukashenko's regime - individuals and entities that 
continue to finance the Lukashenko regime through corrupt activities. These sanctions include oligarch Mikalai 
Varabei and associated companies, former government official Aliaksey Aleksin and associated companies. 
OFAC also sanctioned two major government-owned entities: Belaruskali OAO, a top global producer of fertilizer 
ingredient potassium chloride, and Grodno Tobacco Factory Neman, a tobacco factory and 'major source' of illegal 
cigarettes in the European Union. OFAC issued a general license involving Belaruskali OAO authorizing individuals 
and companies 120 days to wind down transactions. 
The U.S. and international set of sanctions are intended to pressure Belarus to allow an international investigation 
of the Ryanair flight diversion, to release political prisoners, and to refrain from targeting activists who are 
demanding free and fair elections.

Boeing: Trade Me Deadly 
I went to a party last Saturday night. I didn't get picks got in a fight. Uh-huh it ain't no big thing. 
 Ryanair killed an order; Boeing prices are bad. Can't borrow ten bucks from your old man? 
 Uh-huh it ain't no big thing. 
 But I know what I like. I know I like trading with you, Great Ones. And I know what you like. I know you like trading 
with me. 
 Okay that's enough Lita Ford[1] for one day. 
 But Mr. Great Stuff there's never enough Lita Ford! 
 I 
hear 
you, 
but 
we 
have 
to 
talk 
about 
Boeing 
(NYSE: 
BAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=ba&#38;checkSymbol=true) 
and 
Ryanair 
(Nasdaq: 
RYAAYhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=ryaay&#38;checkSymbol=true). I mean, Boeing is a Great Stuff 
Picks holding after all. 
 So, BA stock fell more than 2% today after Ryanair canceled a 737 MAX 10 order[2] reportedly worth billions. 
According to Ryanair, it canceled the order because it was unable to agree on price: 
We are disappointed we couldn't reach [an] agreement with Boeing on a Max 10 order. However, Boeing have a 
more optimistic outlook on aircraft pricing than we do, and we have a disciplined track record of not paying high 
prices for aircraft. 
That was Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, who also speculated that high prices were the reason customers such as 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DALhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=dal&#38;checkSymbol=true) and others were 
moving to Airbus in recent months. 
 And that may be true or it could be that Boeing still has a bit of a PR problem given the 737 MAX issues and the 
787 Dreamliner delays. 
 But I'm pretty certain that none of these issues are why Ryanair just canceled its 737 MAX 10 order. I don't think 
Boeing's pricing is even the issue for Ryanair. 
Boeing Catches Ryanair , Match Strikes Tinder & Terminator X It
 During the same announcement where O'Leary bemoaned Boeing's pricing, he also said that Ryanair had 'more 
than sufficient order pipeline' to meet its growth plans for the next five years. 
So, here's a question: Why would you buy more planes if you already have enough for your growth plans for the 
next five years? Throw in COVID-19 uncertainty over the short term, and you have your answer: There's no reason 
for Ryanair to buy more planes. 
 Sure, Ryanair would love to pick up a couple planes here or there if the price is right. But it already has its needs 
met for the next half-decade. 
 What I believe Ryanair is really saying here is that it won't grow enough to use or need those extra Boeing 737 
MAX 10s. It just doesn't want to come out and tell investors that directly. Telling investors that you won't grow 
enough is bad news bears — even if it's to tell investors you thought about buying more planes but decided you 
didn't need them. 
 So, why not blame Boeing's pricing? After all, Boeing is everyone's whipping boy lately. Who'd notice that you're 
not growing fast enough to need the planes you thought you needed? 
 It's the perfect smokescreen for Ryanair. 
 So, fear not Great Stuff Picks readers. Boeing will be just fine. Remember, we're in this one for the long haul. 
Boeing is a blue chip. It will gain more ground.

 Good: I SPOT A Bull Rally? 
 Don't 
call 
it 
a 
comeback, 
but 
remember 
when 
I 
said 
Spotify 
(NYSE: 
SPOThttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=spot&#38;checkSymbol=true) might've finally caught a break with 
investors? When the sheer exuberance of a billion-dollar share buyback sent SPOT shares[5] up 5%? 
 Well, at long last a whole two weeks later analysts on the Street are coming around to the music-streaming stock. 
SPOT is up 4% today because Keybanc analysts Justin Patterson and Sergio Segura upgraded the stock from 
sector weight to overweight[6], since suddenly they think Spotify's business 'is in a stronger position.' 
 Wow, it took two of you to come up with that? 
 Keybanc also backed up its equivalent of a buy rating by pointing out Spotify's improving user growth, which is a 
valid point. As much as I've complained about Spotify and its constantly changing and boneheaded user interface 
it's really the only game in town for music streaming. 
 Apple Music has its walled garden that Android users typically couldn't care less about, and YouTube Music gets 
some subs on both sides of the mobile OS aisle. But Spotify gets them all no matter how bad its app-building is. 
 I agree with Keybanc's thoughts on user growth, and this is usually the part of the Spotify conversation where I 
remind you that the company has yet to turn that user growth into substantial earnings growth. 
 But in a surprising turn of events, let's forget all of that fundamental nonsense and get technical. I know, math after 
a long weekend? It's inhumane — torture! 
 But is now the right time to buy SPOT stock, like Keybanc recommends? After the stock's 25% rally off of those 
share buybacks? I mean, jeez, even Spotify timed that buy better, Keybanc 
 SPOT shares just broke out of a downtrend of lower highs and lower lows and are now heading toward resistance 
at $270. What this sets up is another short-term peak for SPOT. So, while analysts might be right about Spotify's 
sub growth, which will be good for the company right now is far from the best time to buy in. 
 If you were bullish on SPOT, I'd wait until it pulls back to $250, see if buying support is really there after all and 
then look to buy in. 
Better: I Got Bugs Bugs In My Room 
 Spotify isn't the only stock jumping higher on that ever-elusive analyst attention. No, today's other top dog on the 
Street 
is 
pest-control 
expert 
Terminix 
Global 
(NYSE: 
TMXhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=tmx&#38;checkSymbol=true). If you couldn't tell, this week is starting 
sloooow. 
Boeing Catches Ryanair , Match Strikes Tinder & Terminator X It
 This might be the first time we've talked about Terminix in Great Stuff — frankly, what is there to say? It kills bugs. 
That's it. And I try and avoid thinking about the creepy crawlies myself until I'm called to the domestic front line for 
bug or spider duty. 
 BofA Securities Analyst Gary Bisbee believes that TMX's recent 20% post-earnings sell-off makes the stock a 
buying opportunity. Bisbee double upgraded TMX from underperform to buy[7] and raised his price target from $47 
to $49. 
 TMX is up 7% on the news, and while a double upgrade is all nice and dandy, none of this is what I wanted to talk 
about today with Terminix. BofA rates Terminix higher as a turnaround play, which is fine but what if there was a 
more interesting angle to investing in Terminix? 
 Surprise: It's climate change. 
 Hotter temperatures mean more bugs in your house. And personally, I'm a bit tired of being the resident 
exterminator. (Shout-out to my palmetto-bug-killing Great Ones out there — everybody's a gangster until the roach 
flies at your face.) 
 Terminix will face increasing demand as bug problems get worse. You can try to DIY pretty much every other home 
improvement or repair situation but pest control? Leave it to the brave and willing. 
 You don't have to be an ultra-prepper, getting your bunker ready, to start thinking about climate change plays. I'm 
sorry we had to get all apocalyptic today, but what are you gonna do. Some say the only things left after the world 
ends will be the roaches and Ozzy running Terminix. Whether Keith Richards is on Ozzy's side or the roaches' side 
remains to be seen. 
 So, short of snatching up property around the Great Lakes, what else can you do to keep making bank as the Earth 
burns to a crisp? Buy pest control stocks, apparently. At least we're not getting into water futures[8] or pulling a 
Nestl. 
Best: Love Is All You Need 
 Once upon a time — way back in the olden days before the internet took over everything — you actually had to 
leave your house and participate in the real world to date someone outside of your immediate social circle. Oh, the 
horror! 
 Sure, dating wasn't all chance romantic encounters in bookstores and coffee shops like '90s rom-coms would have 
you believe but there was a certain je ne sais quoi in not knowing when Cupid's arrow might strike. 
 But 
now, 
thanks 
to 
online 
dating 
companies 
like 
Match 
Group 
(Nasdaq: 
MTCHhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ%3AMTCH), you can find your future life 
partner from the comfort of your own home or at least someone to go see the new Spider-Man: No Way Home 
movie with. (Seriously, this movie looks amazing[9]!) 
 For all you Great Ones blissfully avoiding the online dating scene, Match Group is the parent company of dating 
pioneer Match.com. But the brand has grown to include popular dating apps Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of Fish and 
OkCupid, among others[10]. 
 Investors of Match Group were feeling the love this morning after the company's stock rose 7% following news that 
Match will be added to the S&#38;P 500 Index[11] on September 20. 
 Apparently, the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly kind to Match Group, as the dating conglomerate saw a 
surge of new users while people were stuck in lockdown. And here we've all been whining about the ongoing chip 
shortage — love is in the air, Great Ones[12]! 
 But won't Match's business slow down now that people can go outside again, Mr. Great Stuff?  
 Not according to Match Group. In fact, the company expects business to boom now that people can go outside and 
meet their matches at bars and restaurants again. And here I thought love was dead. 
 What about you, Great Ones? Have you ever used an online dating app? Or do you prefer to do things old school 
and meet potential beaus out in the wild? Let us know at GreatStuffToday@BanyanHill.com [13].; 
Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDAhttps://banyanhill.com/stock/symbol/?id=nvda&#38;checkSymbol=true) is this close to 
becoming a fully ARMed and operational battle station. This close, I tell you. 
 But NVDA investors (that's all y'all Great Stuff Picks readers, mind you) know that the company's mission to buy 
out chip designer ARM looks less and less like the Death Star we wanted and more like the remnants of Alderaan. 
 Last we checked in on the chipmaking couple[14], it was up against a battery of regulatory scrutiny in the U.K. Yes, 
it's been literally a year since Nvidia first entered the antitrust limelight and we didn't even get to the EU's approval 
yet. 
Boeing Catches Ryanair , Match Strikes Tinder & Terminator X It
 So, how's that U.K. approval going? To shreds, you say? 
 Approval in the U.K. has been anarchy (I wanna beeeeEEE). The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority — aka 
the CMA, a regulatory watchdog — isn't keen on passing the buyout. Or, as one person with direct knowledge of 
the deal puts it[15]: 
The CMA has been very aggressive. If they are not willing to accept [the] concessions, it will be a matter of trying to 
convince them until the very end. It will go down to the wire. 
And here I thought the deal was already down to the wire. Clearly, Nvidia's '18-month timeline' ain't happening. 
Especially not with fresh fury now brewing among European regulators. 
 And the EU approval oh, to shreds, you say. 
 Yeah Nvidia is filing for approval in the EU this week, but it looks as dubious as the U.K. hassle, unfortunately. 
According to one unnamed EU official: 
It's not certain the deal will get easily cleared here. 
The EU filing is the only 'new' news here: If you've held NVDA this long, you've heard the same doubtful spiel 
before. 
 Antitrust critics still think that Nvidia will cut off licensees' access to ARM's chip tech once the deal is signed, sealed 
and delivered — essentially making Nvidia 'uncompete-able,' if you will, and screwing over the many other 
chipmakers and tech companies that use ARM's chip designs. 
 For its part, Nvidia denied that it would ever do such a malicious, monopolistic thing — the nerve of you to assume 
that! 
 But now there are two regular unknowns hanging over Nvidia's head today: the U.K. and the EU regulators. And 
you know how much Wall Street loves unknown variables, antitrust issues and the ensuing uncertainty 
 Anyway the good news, Great Ones, is that we know Nvidia's chipmaking prowess is strong enough to keep 
driving solid earnings without the extra ARM. Should the buyout get struck down by the EU or U.K., Nvidia would 
keep chugging along as it was before just not as dominantly. 
 With how much Wall Street hates uncertainty, the biggest risk for NVDA investors might not be whether the deal is 
blocked but how long the regulatory thumb-twiddling rhetoric drags on. 
 We'll keep you looped into the NVDA situation, Great Ones. And while we're at it, you should keep me in the loop 
of all the greatness happening in your own portfolio.

stranger, now — write to us whenever the market muse calls to you!

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] August 2021 traffic increased 58.6% year over year to 11.1 million owing to continued 
recovery in air-travel demand in the European Union. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the 
period was 82% compared with 73% in August 2020. The airline operated more than 71,000 flights last month. 
The traffic figures not only represent significant improvement from the year-ago numbers, but also on a sequential 
basis. The European low-cost carrier's August passenger numbers climbed 19.4% from the July level. August load 
factor also ascended 2 percentage points from July. 
Traffic, however, continues to be below the pre-pandemic levels. Evidently, Ryanair's August traffic declined 25.5% 
from 
the 
August 
2019 
level.

Sep 02, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Delta Air Lines' DAL[1] management announced that it intends to boost its workforce by hiring 
1,500 flight attendants in the summer of 2022 to meet the anticipated increase in air-travel demand. Meanwhile, 
Southwest Airlines' LUV[2] pilots opted for the legal route against the company alleging that the latter brought about 
some changes in their pay and working conditions without negotiations during the pandemic. 
The European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[3] August traffic was impressive as widespread 
vaccination in addition to the relaxation of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air travel. Recap of the Past 
Week's Most Important Stories 1. Following the latest announcement to hire flight attendants, Delta, currently 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will have 3,000 flight attendants for the summer of 2022. This is because it had 
recruited 1,500 flight attendants last year before the pandemic struck. The airline requires all new recruits to be fully 
vaccinated before their training starts[4]. 
Delta was also in the news when it announced that its unvaccinated employees will have to pay $200 more per 
month for their company-sponsored healthcare scheme[5]. The surcharge will be effective Nov 1. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. The lawsuit filed by the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association in the federal court in Dallas claims that the airline 
'significantly altered working conditions, rules, and pay rates for pilots' sans negotiations. Per management, 
measures taken by the company to tackle the coronavirus-induced challenges did not require any discussion. The 
pilots' union is seeking an injunction so that the company restores the terms of their collective bargaining 
agreement[7]. 
3. Reflective of the improving air-travel demand scenario in the European Union, Ryanair's August traffic surged 
58.6% year over year to 11.1 million. Load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the period was 82% 
compared with 73% in August 2020. The airline operated more than 71,000 flights last month. That the August 
traffic report will be impressive was hinted at by its CEO Michael O'Leary as reported in the previous week's 
writeup[8]. 
With travel demand continuing to recover, Ryanair announced 14 new routes from London as part of its winter 2021 
schedule. 
4. United Airlines' UAL[9] Boeing 777 jets, one of which was involved in the emergency landing at the Denver 
International Airport in February, remain grounded as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continues to review 
Airline Stock Roundup: DAL 's Hiring Plans, LUV in a Legal Wrangle & More
the Boeing 777-200 planes with Pratt &#38; Whitney engines, per a Reuters report[10]. The jet involved in the 
United Airlines' Denver fiasco was powered by a Pratt &#38; Whitney engine. 
The aircraft had to make an emergency landing at the Denver International Airport after one of its right engines 
failed soon after the take-off. The plane was headed to Honolulu. Following this flight scare, United Airlines stopped 
operating the 24 such jets in its fleet post the FAA order that the planes required inspections. According to the 
Reuters report, The Wall Street Journal reported that United Airlines' 777 jets may not fly until early 2022. 
5. In a customer-friendly move, Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK[11], unveiled 
a new lounge at the San Francisco International airport (SFO). The space offers a variety of facilities like espresso 
drinks and a play area for kids. The latest is an addition to the seven lounges, already operated by Alaska Airlines 
across the United States Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that the majority of stocks have traded in the red in the past week, even though the losses 
were muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index was flat at $92.07. Over the course of the past 
six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 14.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel 
demand improving in Latin America, the August traffic report of Gol Linhas GOL[12] will be keenly awaited in the 
coming days.

Aug 24, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Per Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] CEO Michael O'Leary, the carrier is on track to achieve its current-month 
guidance with respect to passengers to be transported, backed by strong booking trends. This was mentioned in a 
recent Reuters report[2]. 
In July, while reporting first-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Jun 30, 2021) results, this Irish low-cost airline had predicted 
that it will carry more than 10 million passengers in August. With bookings continuing to be impressive, the CEO is 
naturally bullish on the possibility of matching that outlook. 
Expressing his enthusiasm, O'Leary stated: "Ryanair is recovering strongly, much faster than any other airline in 
Europe ... Bookings are increasing very rapidly". 
Ryanair currently expects traffic for fiscal 2022 in the 90-100 million range. The midpoint of this guided range (95 
million) is much higher than the fiscal 2021 traffic of merely 27.5 million. 
In fact, Ryanair's traffic has been improving over the past few months, reflecting the improvement in air-travel 
demand, courtesy of the ramp-up in vaccination drives. Evidently, the carrier transported 1 million passengers in 
April, 1.8 million in May, 5.3 million in June and 9.3 million in July. With bookings remaining strong, O'Leary expects 
August traffic to increase to 10.5 million. Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks 
Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings 
Inc. KNX[4],Landstar System, Inc. LSTR[5] and Herc Holdings Inc. HRI[6]. Both Knight-Swift and Landstar currently 
carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Herc Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7]. 
Long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Knight-Swift, Landstar and Herc 
Holdings is pegged at 15%, 12% and 49.2%, respectively. 
 Tech IPOs With Massive Profit Potential 
 In the past few years, many popular platforms and like Uber and Airbnb finally made their way to the public 
markets. But the biggest paydays came from lesser-known names. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) CEO Confident of Meeting August Traffic Target
 For example, electric carmaker X Peng shot up +299.4% in just 2 months. Think of it this way 
 If you had put $5,000 into XPEV at its IPO in September 2020, you could have cashed out with $19,970 in 
November. 
 With record amounts of cash flooding into IPOs and a record-setting stock market, this year's lineup could be even 
more lucrative. See Zacks Hottest Tech IPOs Now  > >[8]

Aug 05, 2021( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Newcastle International Airport is set to welcome a new base for a 'major' European airline next year. 
 Budget airline Ryanair has announced it will open a new base at the airport in 2022, including 12 new routes to 
destinations across Europe. 
 It is expected that the base, which will include two based aircraft representing a $200m investment, will directly 
create 60 jobs as well as supporting a further 400. 
 Creating 19 routes in total, the base will offer 12 new routes to Zadar, Paphos, Chania, Milan, Riga, Ibiza, 
Menorca, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Krakow. 
 Nick Jones, chief executive at Newcastle International Airport, commented: 'Today's announcement from Ryanair 
to base two aircraft at Newcastle International Airport for summer 2022 is very significant news for both the Airport 
and the region. 
 'Ryanair's investment is a sign of growing confidence and will provide the North East public with a great selection of 
new destinations and extra weekly frequencies, providing more options for leisure and business travel. 
 'This will create new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineering alongside support services, and will generate 
economic value for the wider area.' 
 'We are delighted with the news and look forward to welcoming Ryanair, their crew and staff to their new home at 
Newcastle International Airport in the near future.' 
 Ryanair CEO, Eddie Wilson, added: 'We are delighted to launch a new UK base, which represents a $200m

momentum in South America too owing to ramped-up vaccination. U.S. carriers like American Airlines AAL[4] and 
Southwest Airlines LUV[5] incurred a loss in the second quarter as was reported in the previous week's write up[6].

options for passengers. Travelers will be able to earn and redeem AAdvantage miles on JetSMART flights provided

Jul 27, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of $1.46 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Jun 30, 
2021), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.50. Following the earnings release, shares of 
the company gained 2.6% at the close of business on Jul 26. 
The amount of loss, however, increased year over year due to cancelation of most Easter flights and slow easing of 
the European Union's coronavirus-led travel restrictions in May and June. Although quarterly revenues of $446.4 
million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $459 million, it skyrocketed more than 100% from the year-
ago period, which was characterized by significant decline in traffic owing to large-scale travel restrictions amid 
rising coronavirus cases. 
Ryanair's net loss for the quarter came in at €273 million compared with the year-ago quarter's net loss of €185 
million. Traffic jumped to 8.1 million customers in the reported quarter from a mere 0.5 million in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2021, thanks to increased capacity in May and June. Load factor in the period was 73%, a 12-percentage-
point improvement from the year-ago period. 
Ancillary revenues augmented to €178.6 million from only €24.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to 
significant improvement in traffic, and strong performance in priority boarding and reserved seating. With a 
'sevenfold increase in sectors flown', the airline's fuel and oil expenses surged to €157 million in the fiscal first 
quarter from €8.9 million in the year-ago period. With increased operations, total operating expenses climbed more 
than 100% year over year to €675 million. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), had cash of €4.06 billion at the 
end of Jun 30, 2021 compared with €3.15 billion at the end of Mar 31, 2021. Outlook With the rollout of EU Digital 
Covid Certificates on Jul 1 and the relation of the United Kingdom's quarantine rules for fully vaccinated travelers, 
Ryanair has witnessed accelerated recovery in bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. However, fares are 
still way below pre-coronavirus levels, the airline stated. It now anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic to be in the range of 90 
million-100 million (previous guidance: low end of 80 million-120 million). The company expects to either incur a 
small loss or break even in fiscal 2022, provided vaccine rollout continues this summer and the coronavirus 
situation remains under control. 
With improving close-in bookings, the company estimates traffic to increase to about 9 million in July from more 
than 5 million in June. The same is predicted to be more than 10 million in August. The airline is seeing a strong 
pent up travel demand for August and September, which it expects to continue into the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Shares Gain
Ryanair anticipates pre-coronavirus levels of growth in summer 2022. Performance of Other Airline Stocks 
Southwest Airlines LUV[2], carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), incurred a loss (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring

21 cents. Operating revenues of $4,008 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,942.5 million.

Delta Air Lines DAL[4], carrying a Zacks Rank #3, incurred a loss (excluding $2.09 from non-recurring items) of

Ryanair forecasts 100m passengers in financial year as bookings soar

 Ryanair is expecting to fly 100 million passengers during this financial year after a surge in summer bookings in 
recent weeks, although it warned that it does not expect to make a profit this year. 
The Irish airline increased its passenger forecast to 90-100 million for the 12 months to the end of March 2022, 
thanks to the coronavirus vaccination programme and the easing of some travel restrictions. 
 It expects to carry larger numbers of passengers over the summer, almost doubling from 5 million in June to almost 
9 million in July, and reaching 10 million in August, provided there are no further setbacks as a result of Covid-19. 
 However, the company cautioned that it expected to make a small loss or to just break even during the year to 
March, as it reported that it remained in the red in first quarter of the financial year. 
 Ryanair reported a loss of €273m (234m) for three months to the end of June and said that Covid had continued to 
'wreak havoc' on its business during the period, when most Easter flights were cancelled and there was a slower 
than expected easing of travel restrictions from EU governments. 
 The low-cost carrier flew 8.1 million people from April to June this year, up from only 500,000 in 2020, although its 
losses increased by almost half, up from the €185m loss reported a year earlier. 
 Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said: 'Significant uncertainty around travel green lists (particularly in the 
UK) and extreme government caution in Ireland meant that Q1 bookings were close-in and at low fares. 
 'The 1 July rollout of EU digital Covid certificates (DCC) and the scrapping of quarantine for vaccinated arrivals to 
the UK from mid-July has seen a surge in bookings over recent weeks.' 
 The airline said ticket prices remained lower than pre-Covid levels and it is focusing on the recovery of traffic and 
tourism across its European network during the summer. 
 The announcement came only days after Ryanair said it was aiming to recruit 2,000 pilots over the next three years 
as it tries to rebuild its passenger numbers after the pandemic. 
 The airline has also started to take delivery of its first Boeing 737 Max aircraft and has ordered more than 200 of 
the planes. 
 Ryanair has labelled the Boeing aircraft a 'gamechanger' because of its better fuel efficiency and seat capacity, 
compared with its existing fleet. 
Ryanair forecasts 100m passengers in financial year as bookings soar
 While Ryanair and the aviation sector have been hit hard during the pandemic, the airline believes it is well 
positioned to benefit from the difficulties of its rivals during the crisis, which has resulted in the collapse of European 
competitors.

On May 23, the Belarusian authorities forced the landing of a Ryanair passenger plane with a pro-democratic 
Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich, using a military jet and a false bomb alarm. The forcible landing 
was intended to arrest the activist and his partner Sophia Sapiega. Both Belarusian and Russian authorities went to 
great lengths to spread disinformation about the event. 
DebunkEU.org experts analyzed problematic information flow in a short period after the event May 23-30th. 
Analysts reviewed 300 selected articles on the issues and detected 219 articles (more than 73%), that were 
identified as disinformation. 
Detected disinformation has potentially reached almost 155 million contacts. Numbers prove that topic was 
important for both audience and hostile media outlets. 
Day after the event, pro-Kremlin media outlets copied false statements of Belarusian authorities stating that the 
forced plane landing was conducted accordingly to international laws. However, after the harsh reaction of the 
West, this narrative was muted and was not used that often. 
Despite the short delay of pro-Kremlin media reaction on this event, Russian state-funded media sources aligned 
their stories on the situation with Belarus undemocratic regime and stance and strived to develop a story hand in 
hand with the portrayal of the story in Belarus disinformation outlets. 
 Top narratives concerning the forced landing in Minsk, 23-30 May, 2021 
One plane and a lot of noise. Pro-Kremlin disinformation about forced landing in Minsk
 Through the whole week 23-30 of May, the major message which was spread across the misleading outlets 
attacked representative of pro-democratic opposition Mr Protasievich, claiming that he is a terrorist, dangerous 
extremist, or follower of Nazi ideology. The common use of this narrative aimed to justify the operation. 
 Timeline of creation of harmful narratives 
 Western criticism provoked establishment of new narratives against EU countries and US. Some of them were 
connected to Mr Protasievich stating that he worked for foreign intelligence form countries like Poland or Lithuania 
and was planning to conduct coup in Belarus. In such narratives West countries were portrayed as interfering in 
Belarus internal affairs. Other messages undermined the effort of West to transparently cover the story. The articles 
accused Western countries in politicising the situation as well as reacting hysterically. 
 Sources by the share of published articles 
 The analysis showed a great diversification of Russian language media sources spreading disinformation on this 
topic. Such trend suggests that it was important for Kremlin media to maintain extensive coverage of the topic in 
various channels in order to not only Belarusian version of event but also to ground it in wider audience. 
To present disinformation on the issue technique of association were used very often. Disinformation within the 
association technique predominantly was complemented and reinforced with the statements of Russia's officials 
and other statesmen. It suggests that Russia's officials are active participators of spreading disinformation and they 
legitimize disinformation messages.

 Security officials in Belarus have raided the homes of several independent journalists as part of an ongoing 
crackdown.Belarusian police on Friday carried out a third successive day of raids across the country against 
journalists and human rights activists. 
The raids follow searches by the country's notorious KGB earlier this week of offices of a dozen human rights, news 
and opposition groups. 
The swoops appear to be the latest in what opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko called a new 
crackdown. 
Who are the latest targets? 
The broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Friday said security services had searched the home of the 
head of its Minsk bureau, Valentina Zhdanko. 
Other journalists who work for the outlet also reported raids, with at least one of them arrested and taken for 
questioning. 
Meanwhile, three journalists working for the opposition channel Belsat said their homes had been searched, as did 
an independent journalist based in the western city of Grodno. 
UN rights chief slams Minsk 
Security officials carried out raids on some 20 human rights, charitable, media and expert institutions. They 
detained more than 15 people, among them the head of prominent rights group Viasna-96. 
UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Thursday said she was "deeply alarmed" by the escalating repression. 
 "Such a crackdown is completely unacceptable," said Bachelet, accusing Minsk of showing "blatant disregard... for 
their obligations under international human rights law." 
Lukashenko earlier this week vowed to "find and bring to justice" all of his country's "wretched NGOs." 
The authoritarian leader — who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1994 — sparked mass protests by 
claiming to have won a sixth presidential term in an election last year. 
That drew condemnation from the West, whose leaders say the vote was not free or fair.  
Relations between the EU and Belarus have since deteriorated further with Brussels imposing sanctions on Belarus 
after it forced a Ryanair passenger plane to land in Minsk in late May

Jul 16, 2021( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: https://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 A final thought for the week on bank transformation. I often talk to banks. Some I've spoken to for decades. It 
shocks me that, after decades, they still have exactly the same issues. Fragmentation of data; an organisation built 
over decades with systems that are not integrated; data that is split into lines of business and has never been 
rationalised; management who have no idea and cannot make a decision; leadership that have no idea and cannot 
make a decision (because it's too risky); and a broken business that lumbers onwards. 
 Thing is that the business keeps lumbering onwards. 
 If it's a broken business with systems that don't work, how come it keeps lumbering onwards? 
 Lackadaisical customers. 
 Customers don't care. Customers don't see banks as business they love or embrace. Like getting a telephone or 
electricity or water, it's just a utility. It's just a service that has no customer interest and the customer is not 
interested as long as the service works. 
 Dumb pipes or smart pipes, it's just a utility like waterworks. 
 Hmmmm. 
 I kind of agree with this view and disagree. I kind of feel like banks should be compared to airlines. When the airline 
industry worked, you had a number of national carriers. Like the big national banks, the national airline carriers 
were cumbersome, fragmented and a bit broken, but they lumbered onwards. 
 Then you suddenly had challenger airlines like Southwest Airlines in the USA and Ryanair in Europe. These 
airlines changed the game: they cut back the service to nothing and just focused upon getting you from A to B as 
cheaply as possible. 
 Cool. 
 Funnily enough, we haven't seen a bank like that in most countries (maybe this is an opportunity). 
 Then you saw the rise of super-elite airlines who offered far better service at low-cost. Emirates, Etihad, Qatar and 
others. As a friend of mine said, when you fly from America to Asia, the US airlines is like getting into a grubby old 
yellow taxi and then you switch to the West Asian airlines and it's like entering a Rolls-Royce. Great simile. 
 I see the same simile in the telecommunications industry. AT&#38;T and BT and others have been around for 
years. They provided dial-up services. Who even know what a dial-up is anymore? Sure, those companies are still 
Galileo or Mars - where do you want to go?
going, but we all moved to being mobile. Vodafone, O2, Verizon and more are now mainstream. Who even thinks 
about AT&#38;T and BT? 
 Now, sure these firms are still around and, luckily for them, managed to become the backbone of broadband 
services. Great. Yet, it's still a challenge to move from dial-up to broadband to mobile, so that transition was not 
obvious or easy. 
 It's a bit like USPS and Royal Mail. People mail each other. It used to be mailing envelopes and letters. People 
actually used to use a pen and paper and write to each other!?!?! Who the hell does that anymore? 
 Then, luckily for USPS and Royal Mail, everyone switched to ordered stuff online so that's what's now sent and 
delivered. Forget pen and paper, we want Amazon boxes. Thing is that it's also created DPD, UPS, FedEx and 
more. 
 In other words, the world has changed, but many of the businesses that were around last century are still here 
today because they've changed too. Have they changed enough? Can they keep up? Are they fit for purpose today 
and tomorrow? 
 Who knows, but what I do know is that American Airlines, British Airways, AT&#38;T, BT, USPS, Royal Mail and 
more are trying to become 21st century digital businesses but are struggling with it in the same way as Chase and 
Lloyds. Yet, when you lift the hood on any of these businesses, there's an aching, creaking old infrastructure 
underneath. If you haven't seen it, just look at Galileo which is the old system that runs the airlines. 
 Galileo is a green-screen 3270 mainframe system developed about a thousand years ago. Just go up to any airline 
desk and ask the check-in person to show you their screen. It's absolutely archaically disgusting. 
 Nevertheless, by comparison with what some of my bank friends deal with, it's truly visionary and innovatory. 
Damn. 
 Refresh and reboot or solve and evolve? What do you think? Galileo or Mars? Where do you want to go?

Jul 13, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Spirit Airlines SAVE[1] announced that it intends to expand its operations at Orlando International 
Airport (MCO). With the plan in place to operate its largest-ever Orlando schedule, the carrier expects to provide 
more than 80 daily departures from MCO by 2021 end. 
With air-travel demand picking up in the United States, American Airlines AAL[2] too announced an expansion plan. 
The carrier aims to fortify its footprint in Miami, FL with two international destinations and six domestic routes, slated 
for launch this winter. 
European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] announced plans to hire more than 2,000 pilots over the next three 
years as it modernizes its fleet and gradually recovers from the COVID-led setback. In an investor update, 
management at Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[4] projected second-quarter 2021 load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) to be 85.1%. Detailed results will be out on Jul 29. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important 
Stories 1. On materialization, Spirit Airlines' robust expansion plan, which was announced at MCO, will make the 
carrier the largest international airline in Orlando. On an overall basis, the impending extension will make the airline 
the second-largest carrier operating out of MCO. Its Orlando operations will be 45% above the schedule at the end 
of 2019 following the activation of new and resumed routes[5]. 
Spirit Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. As part of its fleet-modernization plans, Ryanair announced that it took delivery of the first fuel-efficient Boeing 
737-8200 Gamechanger aircraft. The carrier intends to take delivery of more than 210 Boeing 737-8200 
Gamechanger aircraft over the next three years. With these anticipated additions to its fleet, the carrier looks to 
boost its work force. It hopes to continue its recovery from the coronavirus-induced damage and fly 200 million 
passengers by the fiscal year 2024. 
We remind investors that Ryanair's June traffic was impressive as wide-spread vaccination in addition to the easing 
of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air-travel demand as was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[7]. 
3 As part of its expansion plan in Miami, American Airlines intends to begin services to Chetumal, Mexico and San 
Andres Island, Colombia from Miami International Airport this December. Following this addition, the Fort Worth, 
TX-based carrier will serve 28 destinations in Mexico and seven in Colombia. Flights to Chetumal and San Andres 
Airline Stock Roundup: SAVE 's Route Additions, Gol 's Investor Update & More
Island will operate on Wednesdays and Saturdays. While the Chetumal service will begin on Dec 1, the San Andres 
Island flights will commence from Dec 4[8]. 
4. Gol Linhas expects second-quarter EBITDA margin (excluding special items) in the band of 16-18%. Passenger 
unit revenues for the June quarter are expected to be approximately 17% lower than the year-ago reported number. 
Non-fuel unit costs in the to-be-reported quarter (excluding non-operating and non-recurring expenses) are 
expected to decrease roughly 55% from the prior-year reported number. Total capacity (measured in available seat 
kilometers) is expected to increase roughly 307% from the second-quarter 2020 reported level. Strong seasonal 
demand is expected to drive the third-quarter capacity to 80% above the June-quarter reading. 
5. At Azul AZUL[9], June's consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers, increased 18.2% month 
over month. With travel demand rising, capacity moved up 16.8% in June from the May tally. Since traffic surge was 
more than capacity expansion, load factor rose to 76.8% in June from 75.8% in May[10]. Performance The following 
table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows most airline stocks have traded in the red over the past week even though the losses were 
muted in nature. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has been more or less flat over the past five trading 
days. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated13%. What's Next in 
the Airline Space? Investors will keenly await the second-quarter 2021 earnings report of Delta Air Lines DAL[11]

 Bitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything  
 Blockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it 
the 'Internet of Money' and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what 
Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we're still in the early stages of this technology, 
and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.

and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly. See 3 crypto-related stocks

 A group of leading travel businesses including Ryanair, BA, travel business Tui and Manchester Airports Group 
have launched legal action against the government over its travel curbs. 
They want more transparency over how the government takes decisions on Covid travel rules. 
 In particular, they want to know how it assesses the Covid threat in destination countries. 
 The action is going ahead despite an easing of travel rules on Friday. 
 The chief executives of the groups involved said in a statement: 'British consumers need to understand how 
decisions are made so they can confidently plan their travel, which is why we are asking the government to provide 
the data and advice that is underpinning its decision making.' 
 The rules on travel now mean that, starting from 19 July, fully-vaccinated British residents returning from so-called 
amber list countries, which are deemed a medium-risk, will no longer have to quarantine on arrival back in the UK. 
 The traffic light system rates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. 
 Red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and 
they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. 
 There are still just a handful of 'green' destinations, which tend to be smaller islands, for example, Malta. 
 Major holiday destinations, such as Spain, Greece, France and the US, remain amber. 
 Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list, while more than 50 countries are on the red list. 
 Travel companies have long complained they have little idea how the government makes decisions on travel rules. 
 The group wants a wider re-opening of travel. 
 Airlines and travel companies say the limits on trave lhave had a devastating impact on the industry. 
 Their case, which is against the transport minister Grant Shapps, was heard at London's High Court on Friday. 
 The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system was intended to manage the risk of new 
variants, and added that the department could not comment on legal proceedings.

 Nasha Niva, one of Belarus' oldest newspapers, is the latest independent media organization in Belarus to be 
targeted by authorities over its reporting.Authorities in Belarus on Thursday blocked the website of Nasha Niva, a 
leading online media outlet, and detained several of its journalists.  
Belarus' Information Ministry said it moved against the website for posting unspecified "unlawful" information.  
The block is the latest in a widespread crackdown on independent media in Belarus. Last year, the government 
faced a massive protest movement against strongman President Alexander Lukashenko.  
Nasha Niva journalists detained 
The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) said police carried out searches of Nasha Niva's offices, and 
detained its editor-in-chief, Yahor Martsinovich, along with editor Andrey Skurko. Their apartments were also 
searched.  
Martsinovich's wife confirmed on Facebook that he had been detained. 
The BAJ added that four other journalists at the outlet could not be reached. On social media, Nasha Niva also said 
that it had lost contact with several employees 
Clampdown on media in Belarus  
Nasha Niva, a weekly newspaper founded in 1906, is one of Belarus' oldest and most trusted media outlets. 
The paper extensively covered the months of intense protests against the reelection of Lukashenko in a vote that is 
widely considered to be rigged. 
Another popular news website that covered the protest movement, Tut.by, also had access blocked in May, and 12 
of its journalists were arrested on tax evasion charges.  
In May, Belarusian authorities forcefully diverted a Ryanair flight to Minsk and arrested dissident journalist Raman 
Pratasevich, resulting in heavy sanctions from the European Union.  
The BAJ said 27 Belarusian journalists were currently either sitting in jail or awaiting trial.  
"The crackdown on independent media in Belarus is continuing,'' BAJ head Andrei Bastunets told the AP news 
agency.  
"The authorities see journalists and independent information as their main enemies," he added.

 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] June 2021 traffic surged to 5.3 million guests from a mere 0.4 million in the year-ago 
period when air-travel demand hit rock bottom amid large-scale travel restrictions and rising coronavirus cases. 
The airline attributed the improvement in traffic to increased vaccinations in the European Union, which is in turn 
driving recovery in air-travel demand. Having operated more than 38,000 flights in June, the European low-cost 
carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) was 72%. 
Ryanair's June traffic figure represents a significant improvement from 1.8 million guests in May. The airline's traffic 
in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 8.1 million with a load factor of 73%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, traffic 
was 
extremely 
tepid 
at 
0.51 
million.

 Despite this improvement, traffic continues to significantly lag the pre-pandemic (2019) levels. While first-quarter 
fiscal 2022 traffic has increased substantially from the fiscal 2021 figure, it is way below 41.8 million in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation [4]sector are C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[5], 
Expeditors International of Washington EXPD[6] and ArcBest Corporation ARCB[7]. While C.H. Robinson carries a 
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Expeditors and ArcBest sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each. You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. 
Shares of C.H. Robinson, Expeditors and ArcBest have rallied more than 16%, 65% and 100% in a year's time, 
respectively. Zacks Names 'Single Best Pick to Double' From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have 
chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz 
Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround. 
Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent 
Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and 
Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Jul 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, United Airlines UAL[1] announced that it placed an order for buying 270 narrow-body jetliners. 
Notably the order, which includes Boeing and Airbus jets, is the largest-ever order in the history of this Chicago-
based carrier. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] also grabbed headlines by virtue of its decision to start operating non-stop flights between 
Boise and the New York City. Notably, this seasonal service, which started operating from Jul 2, is the only non-
stop flight connecting Boise and the Northeast. It is aimed at meeting the anticipated demand swell during summer. 
Meanwhile, the European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[3] June traffic was impressive as wide-spread 
vaccinations in addition to the easing of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air-travel demand. Recap of the 
Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. In line with its objective to realize its post-COVID growth plan, United 
Airlines, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), placed an order to purchase 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 70 
Airbus A321neo jets. The airline aims to replace the older, smaller mainline and regional jets with larger aircraft. 
United Airlines expects the newer aircraft, featuring more premium seats with larger overhead bins and seatback 
entertainment screens, to improve fuel efficiency by 11% as well as reduce carbon emission per seat by 17-20% 
from the older ones[4]. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
2.With air-travel demand improving in the United States as more and more people are getting vaccinated every day, 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[6] announced that it intends to broaden its domestic network by adding three 
routes later this year. As part of this expansion drive, Allegiant announced that the new nonstop flights from the 
Melbourne Orlando International Airport (MLB) to Pittsburgh, PA, Nashville, TN and Concord, NC will take off in 
November 2021. Per the schedule, flights on the MLB-Pittsburgh route will operate from Nov 11 while non-stop 
flights connecting MLB with Nashville and Concord will take to the skies on Nov 18. Allegiant will operate flights on 
all the new routes twice a week[7]. 
3. Following JetBlue's decision to launch flights to Boise, the site became the low-cost carrier's first destination in 
the state of Idaho. Notably, flights on the new route connecting Boise Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy 
International Airport are operating four times a week through Labor Day this year. Notably, the same flights will 
return in the summer of 2022. Notably, JetBlue operates Boise flights using its Airbus A320 aircraft.[8]

4. Reflecting improved air-travel demand, Ryanair Holdings' June traffic jumped to 5.3 million guests in June from 
0.4 million guests a year-ago. The carrier's load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in the month was 72%. 
Also, in the same period, Ryanair operated in excess of 38,000 flights. 
Notably, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary recently painted a rosy picture with respect to bookings following the onset 
of the summer holidaying spell. This was mentioned in the previous week's writeup[9]. 
5. Alaska Air Group's ALK[10] subsidiary Alaska Airlines announced a codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways, 
thereby expanding its partnership with the oneworld alliance member. This new agreement offers Alaska Airlines' 
customers a wider connectivity to various locations in Qatar and other middle-eastern countries as well as in Africa 
and South Asia. With international travel demand gradually recovering as countries reopen their borders to 
vaccinated travelers, the codeshare agreement should help boost traffic for Alaska Airlines[11]. Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green in the past week leading the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index to gain 1.5% to $100.14. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
appreciated 22.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel demand continuing to move north, more 
updates on route additions by the airlines are expected in the coming days. Zacks Names 'Single Best Pick to 
Double' From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in 
months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive 
upside of all. 
You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
 Honest Mistakes or Deliberate Disinformation? 
 Satire and humour have an obvious place in democratic discourse. The Russian satirical website Panorama has 
since 2017 successfully poked fun at several features of Russian and international politics. But occasionally, the 
authorities have failed to get the joke and taken the satire at face value. 
Satire site Panorama was founded in 2017, but panorama.pub tells of an intriguing history that goes back much 
further. It calls itself 'the oldest Soviet and Russian news agency', says it was founded in 1822, nationalised by the 
Bolsheviks after the Russian revolution, and worked illegally all the way through to 1988. 
On its site, it pledges to stay loyal to its 200-year-old traditions, and report on events in Russia and around the 
world objectively and accurately. 
True to form, the history is all a spoof. All we know of Panorama's past is that it was launched four years ago by two 
individuals who go by the aliases Boris Gontermakher and Vitaly Mann. In an interview in 2019 they claimed to 
have seven to ten freelance writers. 
Panorama has spoofed its way to exceptional success. Its website attracts up to 100,000 visits a day, and it also 
runs popular social media accounts - over 60,000 subscriberson Twitter[2]and over 25,000 followerson Telegram[3]. 
One recent articleclaims[4]the prominent Belarusian opposition politician, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, signed a 
decree selling the Belarusian airline Belavia to Ryanair for the symbolic price of 1 euro as a goodwill gesture, 
following the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Belarus this May. 
Kremlin Not Getting The Joke
It alsoreports[5]the news that the electric car company Tesla had to stop production and send thousands of workers 
on unpaid leave after Belarus stopped supplying it with components. 
In 2018, the Russian senator Igor Morozov, interviewed on the radio station Vesti FM,quoted[6]a Panorama news 
story that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, had fired 29 regional governors for laziness. Morozov said this zero-
tolerance policy towards bad behaviour in state officials could be a good example for Russia to follow. 
 Satire Taken at Face Value 
 This is not the only time a Panorama story has migrated into the mainstream news. The site's satirical articles have 
been repeatedly taken at face value by Russian state news agencies and high-ranking officials, who rapidly become 
objects of ridicule as soon as it becomes apparent they've been taken in by stories that are pure fantasy. 
On its logo Panorama clearly states it's a 'satirical outlet', and it also places warnings under its stories that they're a 
'grotesque parody of reality'. Despite this, its material has been reposted dozens of times by state media, and its 
invented 'facts' are presented as the truth by high-ranking Russian officials. 
In September 2018, Zvezda, a nationwide, state-owned TV network run by the Ministry of Defence, also fell for one 
of Panorama's imaginative pranks. Itreposted[7]the fake story of a Russian schoolteacher who taught kids the 
biographies of local crime bosses. 
Russia Today has also fallen for Panorama's made-up stories. On its Telegram channel itcarried[8]the news that a 
former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov, had attempted suicide. This 'news' was 
picked up by dozens of media outlets and discussed on the Rossiya 1 political talk show. 
The high-profile Russian journalist and pro-Kremlin propagandist, Vladimir Solovyov, has alsotwice[9]been fooled 
by Panorama's satire. The first story concerned Chinese and Americans fighting in Paris over the Soviet Union's 
role in World War Two. The second was about the Yeltsin Centre helping protesters in Yekaterinburg. Solovyov 
then became involved in a heated altercation on Twitter, accusing the humour site of spreading fake news. 
Panorama's influence has extended beyond Russia. In 2018, the Belarussian ONT TV channel 
proudlyannounced[10]on its Telegram channel that President Alyaksandr Lukashenka had been nominated for a 
Nobel prize by a Belarusian scientist, who it transpired was entirely fictitious and invented by Panorama. 
 A Polish Joke 
 On 30 July 2020, Panoramareported[11]that the Polish President, Andrzej Duda, had said the Polish army was 
ready to take over the Belarusian cities of Brest and Hrodna, as well as the rest of western Belarus. According to 
Duda's fictitious statement, Poland was preparing to protect areas that had once been part of the Polish 
Commonwealth. 
Following presidential elections in Belarus in August 2020, a wave of anti-government protests broke out across the 
country. Panorama's fantasy statement from the Polish President was seized on by pro-Kremlin media and woven 
into repeated disinformation narratives about Polish imperial aspirations and the West's aggressive plans for 
Belarus. 
EUvsDisinfo has documentedover 40 disinformation cases[12], warning of aggressive Polish intentions to create a 
so-calledFourth Rzeczpospolita[13](Polish Commonwealth),to take over Minsk[14], and ultimatelyto colonise the 
whole of Belarus, along with Ukraine[15]. 
President Duda's fictional statement took on a life of its own over the days and weeks to come. It waspicked 
up[16]by 
Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta, 
andZvezda 
Weekly[17],Fond 
Strategicheskoy 
Kremlin Not Getting The Joke
Kultury[18],Eurasia.expert[19]followed, along with other pro-Kremlin websites. They either quoted Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta, or left out the source of the statement altogether. Duda's 'statement' also appeared inTeleskop[20], which 
alleged 'Anglo-Saxons controlled Poland'. 
 Fool Me Twice 
 Over time, journalists and officials have learnt from other people's mistakes - and their own - and now know what 
Panorama is, and what it isn't. It's entirely possible the pro-Kremlin disinformation network has also learnt from the 
Panorama experience that satire has its uses, by presenting convenient fakes as real news at the right time. 
Panorama can be seen as something post-ironic, when something absurd is taken seriously. Many people who 
believe pro-Kremlin propaganda will have taken President Duda's statement at face value, especially as it appeared 
on websites that didn't have that helpful 'satirical outlet' printed on their logos, as Panorama does. 
EUvsDisinfo includes several cases where Russian state media have used images fromvideo games[21]as 'proof' 
of military action inSyria[22]and theSouth Caucasus[23]. Are the examples above honest mistakes or deliberate 
attempts to fool the audience? There are more than12,000 cases of disinformation[24]in the EUvsDisinfo database 
on disinformation. Facts are peripheral in the pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts, and checking a 'good story' is 
irrelevant.

Belarus tells Germany 's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down
Belarus tells Germany's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down

Jul 01, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Germany's Goethe Institute and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) have been told to suspend their 
Belarus activities. It comes in response to sanctions imposed on Minsk by the EU.On Thursday, Germany's cultural 
Goethe Institute issued a short press statement announcing that it had been asked to cease its Belarus activities. It 
was clear that they were taken by surprise. 
"This is an unprecedented step for the Goethe Institute, which can freely work in its 157 institutes across the world," 
the organization's secretary-general, Johannes Ebert, said on Thursday. He said Minsk's decision was regrettable, 
and expressed hope that the educational and cultural body would soon be able to resume its work. 
Ebert also expressed solidarity with his "colleagues on the ground" and the German Academic Exchange Service 
(DAAD), which has also been asked to suspend its Belarus operations. It has published a similarly worded press 
release. 
German lawmakers lambast Minsk 
Belarus announced the ban on Wednesday evening. A spokesperson with Germany's Foreign Ministry said the 
move will "further isolate Belarus internationally." 
Jürgen Hardt, a foreign policy expert with Germany's Christian Democrats, told DW that "[President Alexander] 
Lukashenko is apparently backed up against the wall." Belarus citizens, he added, are rising up against 
Lukashenko, while the strongman is trying to isolate his country so his people cannot access outside information. 
Hardt said Lukashenko does not want his people learning German and watching German television. This, he said, 
amounts to a bizarre attempt at stabilizing his regime. 
Erhard Grundl, a lawmaker with Germany's Greens, was similarly saddened by Minsk's move. "In times like these, 
projecting soft power through cultural foreign policy carries great importance." Grundl said that the Goethe Institute 
was a "voice for freedom." 
Tit for tat 
The move against both German organizations comes after the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus after 
it forced a Ryanair passenger plane to land in Minsk in late May. Dissident blogger Roman Protasevich was taken 
off the plane and arrested. Belarus has also left the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative. 
Germany's DAAD, which has had an office in the Belarusian capital since 2003, provides information to locals about 
studying and researching in Germany. The forced closure means six DAAD editors, who currently work at 
Belarusian universities, will have to leave the country. 
Virtual events continue 
Belarus tells Germany 's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down
The Goethe Institute set up shop in Minsk in 1993. It runs a library, a reading room in Wizebsk, and it operates a 
bus delivering German-language media and information about the country to Belarusians across the country. 
The organizations employs dozens of people, most of them locals. German language classes are very popular, 
along with cultural events such as lectures, readings and film screenings. But the coronavirus pandemic has meant 
that all of these events have been online only. 
A talk format hosted by the Goethe Institute on Zoom centers around the theme of "literature in difficult times," 
featuring novelists and poets from Belarus and Hong Kong, discussing their creative processes. Belarus and Hong 
Kong, after all, have experienced large anti-government protests lately. Belarusian novelist Viktor Martinowitsch, 
whose recent work Revolution is popular with the opposition, is part of the line-up. 
It is not clear at this stage how soon the Goethe Institute and German Academic Exchange Service will have to 
close down their Belarus offices, or what will come next. Both organizations may intensify their work in neighboring 
Russia and Ukraine, hoping to service Belarus from abroad. A Goethe Institute spokesperson told DW "virtual 
language courses will remain available to everyone, regardless of their location."

Jun 30, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The coronavirus pandemic, which was aptly described in April 2020 as the 'the worst financial crisis in aviation 
history" by United Airlines' UAL[1] former CEO Oscar Munoz, caused an untold misery to airlines last year. With air-
travel demand touching a nadir, most airline companies incurred losses in each of the four quarters of 2020. 
Reflecting the hardships, the Zacks Airline [2]industry declined 26.4% last year. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
However, the industry participants' fortunes changed with the advent of 2021. Wide-spread vaccinations instilled 
confidence in people to fly once again without the fear of contracting the infection from a fellow-traveler. As a result 
of the uptick in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure), carriers including Delta Air Lines DAL[3], Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] announced plans to add/resume operations on several routes to meet the 
demand surge. Also, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] is seeing a swell in passenger count despite the 
coronavirus-led travel restrictions, per a Reuters report[7]. 
Moreover, in the United States, the Transportation Security Administration screened more than two million people in 
not less than 10 days during June (considering the data until Jun 29). In fact, TSA screened 2,167,380 people last 
Sunday [8]i.e. Jun 27, 2021. This was the highest reading taken since Mar 5, 2020. Betterment of the scenario is 
well-reflected in the Zacks Airline industry's growth of 6.9% year to date. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Air Traffic Likely to Continue Northward Movement in 2H While the 
weakness pertaining to business travel is unlikely to disappear soon, overall air-travel demand is likely to continue 
improving in the second half of 2021, driven by leisure travel. The fact that the expectation of a recovery is not only 
restricted to the United States is clear from the fact the European carrier Ryanair's recent addition of 200,000 seats 
on flights from the United Kingdom to Malta and the Balearics (Ibiza and Palma) for July, August and September. 
This follows the U.K. government's decision to include these islands on the green list for travel that allows flyers to 
visit these sites without having to quarantine (provided they are declared COVID negative) themselves on their 
return. The relaxation is effective today. 
Even in Latin America, air-travel demand is northbound on the back of ramped-up vaccination programs. This is 
evident from the fact that consolidated traffic at Azul AZUL[9] improved 12.4% in May from the April tally. At another 
Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[10], May traffic surged 65% month over month. 
3 Airline Stocks to Watch in 2H as Air-Travel Scene Brightens
Riding on such an improved scenario, Gol's outlook for the second half of 2021 seems rosy. The carrier, currently 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects net operating revenues for the latter half to be approximately R$6 billion, 
much higher than the second-quarter estimate of roughly R$1 billion. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[11]. 
Moreover, alike the first half of the year, the focus on the cargo segment should continue to serve airlines well in the 
latter half of the year too. 
The above write-up clearly suggests that things are on the mend as far as airlines are concerned and the second 
half of the year should see this momentum to continue on the back of improvements witnessed in first half of the 
year. We therefore highlighted three airline stocks, each presently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, that investors should 
keep tabs on. Our Choices United Airlines: In response to a better air-travel demand, United Airlines plans to add in 
excess of 400 daily flights to its July schedule. The airline expects to operate 80% of its pre-pandemic U.S. 
schedule in the month as summer travel bookings soar 214% from the 2020 levels. The company's cost-control 
initiatives are supporting its bottom line. Owing to an improved air-travel demand scenario, the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for 2021 is currently pegged at a loss of $14.15 per share, narrower than the loss of $14.26 estimated for 
the stock 60 days ago. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[12]: Restoration of leisure-travel demand is a huge plus for this Dallas-based carrier. To 
meet the anticipated demand upturn in the latter half of the year, Southwest Airlines recently announced a pay hike 
for its hourly employees. The impending increment, which will be effective Aug 1, is aimed at retaining its existing 
employees as well as attracting new personnel. 
Owing to bloated bookings, aided by an upswing in air-travel demand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 is 
currently pegged at a loss of $1.29 per share, narrower than the loss of $1.47 estimated for the stock 60 days ago. 
Alaska Air Group ALK[13]: With air-travel demand rising, Alaska Airlines is constantly looking to add routes and 
widen its network to meet the anticipated demand swell. This upbeat scenario led to a healthy cash flow from the 
company's operations. 
Boosted by higher bookings, attributable to a spike in air-travel demand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 
currently stands at a loss of $2.50 per share, narrower than the loss of $2.86 expected for the stock in the past 60 
days. 
Notably, shares of United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air have rallied 20.5%, 13.5% and 15.6%, 
respectively, so far this year. Take a look ---

opportunities.

Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Dips on Tougher Travel Rules Across Europe

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] fell 2.4% at the close of business on Jun 28, following tighter travel 
restrictions imposed in some parts of Europe to contain the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus. Among 
several other travel stocks, shares of U.S. carriers such as Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3] also 
declined on Monday. 
While Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), Delta and United Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. 
The Portuguese government has introduced measures to restrict non-vaccinated travelers from the United 
Kingdom[4]. U.K. travelers will not be allowed to enter the country without a 14-day quarantine period, unless they 
are 
fully 
vaccinated.

 Malta, which is on the U.K.'s green travel list, has also decided to allow only double-vaccinated people from the 
United Kingdom, beginning Jun 30, when relaxations on traveling to the U.K.'s green-listed places are set to go into 
effect. Being included in the U.K.'s green list implies that U.K. residents can travel to these places without having to 
quarantine (provided their COVID-19 test results are negative) on their return. 
In Spain, U.K. travelers are required to provide proof of full vaccination or a negative PCR test to be allowed entry. 
The restrictions across Europe have been imposed with particular emphasis on U.K. travelers since the Delta 
variant, which was first spotted in India, has been more prominent in the country. 
The stricter restrictions might weigh on Ryanair's summer travel bookings. The airline recently announced seat 
additions on flights from the United Kingdom to Malta for July, August and September. Moreover, earlier this month, 
the European low-cost carrier began operating flights to Faro, Portugal from Teesside, United Kingdom as part of its 
UK Summer 2021 Schedule. A Key Pick A better-ranked stock in the broader Transportation[7] sector is Expeditors 
International of Washington EXPD[8], sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[9]. 
Shares of Expeditors have rallied more than 65% in a year's time. +1,500% Growth: One of 2021's Most Exciting

Jun 29, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Gary Kelly, who has been serving Southwest Airlines LUV[1] as its CEO since 2004, announced 
that he will relinquish his post in early 2022. This Dallas-based carrier was also in news when it reportedly[2] 
decided to increase the minimum remuneration of its nearly 7,000 employees to $15 an hour. The strategic move is 
aimed at retaining/attracting workers as air-travel demand picks up. 
Notably, the raises, which will be effective Aug 1, will be in the 7-11% range for the new hirees. Moreover, this pay-
hike plan will cover the call center operators, customer service agents, skycaps and others. However, the company 
will have to negotiate with labor unions before the increased wage materializes for some labor groups. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] announced the addition of 200,000 seats on flights from the United 
Kingdom to Malta and the Balearics (Ibiza and Palma) for July, August and September. This follows the U.K. 
government's decision to include these islands on the green list for travel, which allows people to visit these places 
without having to quarantine (provided their COVID-19 test results are negative) themselves on their return. The 
relaxation is set to be implemented on Jun 30. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Southwest 
Airlines picked company veteran Robert Jordan to succeed Gary Kelly as its new CEO, once the latter steps down 
in February 2022. Kelly, however, plans to serve as the company's executive chairman through 2026. Notably, 
Jordan joined the carrier in 1988 and currently serves as its executive vice president, corporate services. He played 
a crucial role in several transformational measures taken by the company[4]. 
Southwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
2. Delta Air Lines DAL[6] expanded its codeshare agreement with Kenya Airways, thereby boosting connectivity 
between the United States and Africa. The agreement builds on the two airlines' existing codeshare network to offer 
smooth travel to 39 cities across Africa, the United States and Canada. As part of this extended deal, customers 
can have access to flights operated by Kenya Airways on the routes to Monrovia, Liberia and Freetown in Sierra 
Leone where Delta shared its code[7]. 
Notably, Delta is constantly looking to restore its international network. To this end, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier 
announced plans to resume flights to South Africa shortly, as was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[8].

3. With the onset of the summer travel period, Ryanair is seeing a swell in passenger numbers despite coronavirus-
led travel restrictions, per a Reuters report[9]. In an interview with Reuters, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary stated 
that bookings witnessed significant recovery over the last eight weeks with increased number of the same to 
Portugal and other popular destinations from Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries. Per the report, 
O'Leary said, "Traffic is mushrooming and a lot of that folk are families going on summer holidays to the beaches of 
Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy." He further added that the airline expected to fly 80-100 million passengers in 
fiscal 2022. 
4. Spirit Airlines SAVE[10] started operating non-stop flights to Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport Jun 24 
onward. The inaugural celebrations, however, brought more good news to fliers. Management of this Miramar, FL-
based ultra low-cost carrier announced that additional non-stop flights to this favorite tourist spot in the state of 
Wisconsin will be launched later this year. On materialization, the above expansion will nearly triple Spirit Airlines' 
flights to Milwaukee[11]. 
5. Reflecting the upswing in air-travel demand as more and more people are being administered the COVID-19 
vaccines, management at United Airlines UAL[12] expects adjusted pre-tax income for July to be positive. If this 
expectation comes true, the next month will definitely mark the first period since January 2020 when this key metric 
takes a favorable turn. Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the 
past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks barring American Airlines AAL[13] have traded in the red over the 
past week, inducing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to dip 4.2% to $100. However, over the course of the past six 
months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 16.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will

plans (up to two times) with no change fee until the end of December 2021. 
With these islands being added to the green list, the airline called on British transport minister Grant Shapps to add 
other 'equally safe destinations such as Cyprus, the Canaries &#38; the Greek Islands.' It also urged the 
government to 'immediately allow vaccinated UK &#38; EU citizens to travel freely between the UK &#38; the EU 
without

Jun 28, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] shares have dropped 2.3% in the past six months against the industry[2]'s 8.5% 
increase. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Reasons for Plunge The resurgence of coronavirus cases in some 
parts of Europe had worsened the already weak travel demand scenario, thanks to the recent travel-related 
restrictions. Evidently, the airline's March traffic plunged 91% year over year to merely 0.5 million guests. The 
carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the month was 77% compared with 91% a year 
ago. In April, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) fell further to 67%. In May, the airline operated more than 
12,000 flights with a load factor of 79%. 
Amid coronavirus-led travel-demand woes, the airline regarded fiscal 2021 as the most 'challenging' in its 35-year 
history. The airline anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2022 traffic to be only between 5 million and 6 million guests. 
Ryanair anticipates slow vaccine rollout in the European Union to affect fiscal 2022 traffic. The airline estimates its 
fiscal 2022 traffic to be at the low end of the guidance of 80-120 million passengers, as a result of 'Easter travel 
restrictions/lockdowns and a delayed traffic recovery into the peak summer 21 season, due to the slow rollout in the 
EU of COVID-19 vaccines. Unfavorable Estimate Revisions The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year 
earnings has declined 93.5% to 6 cents per share in the past 60 days. Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [3]sector are Landstar System, Inc. LSTR[4], Triton 
International Limited TRTN[5] and FedEx Corporation FDX[6]. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can 
see the complete list of today's Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here[7]. 
Long-term (three to five years) expected earnings per share growth rate for Landstar, Triton and FedEx is projected 
at 12%, 10% and 12%, respectively. Bitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything Blockchain and 
cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the 'Internet of 
Money' and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what Netflix did to

 Ryanair Flight 4978 was subject to a bomb threat in Belarussian airspace on May 23 and it was escorted to Minsk 
by a MIG-29 fighter jet where opposition activist Roman Protasevich was detained, along with his girlfriend. 
Condemnation of the episode was swift with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen descrbing "the 
hijacking of the Ryanair plane bythe Belarus regime[3]as an attack on democracy" while U.S. President Joe Biden 
condemned it "in the strongest possible terms".  
 As Statista's Niall McCarthy notes,[4] the event served as a reminder that some sections of international airspace 
carry an inherent level of risk for passenger flights.  
 Cases of "air piracy" have proven rare down through the years but the Ryanair incident has striking similarities to 
another forced diversion that occurred in July 1971. That involved a BOAC flight carrying two men associated with 
an abortive coup d'tat attempt in Sudan being forced to land in Benghazi, Libya by the Gaddafi regime. The men in 
question were handed over to Sudan and immediately executed upon orders from the country's new president. 
More recently, the shootdown of Ukraine International Flight 752 over Tehran in 2020 and the destruction of 
Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Eastern Ukraine in 2014 have shown thatconflict and geopolitical tensions also 
pose a risk to commercial airliners[5].  
 Other notable cases down through the years include USS Vincennes shooting down Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988 with 
the loss of all 290 people on board as well as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 which was shot down by a Soviet SU-15 
fighter jet in 1983 with all 269 crew and passengers onboard perishing. Give those incidents and the recent shock 
emanating from Belarus, which parts of the world pose the greatest risk to civilian air traffic in 2021? The bulk of 
airspace safety alerts are released by the U.S. (FAA), UK (DFT), Germany (BMVI) and France (DGAC) and they 
have been brought together by theConflict Zone and Risk Database[6]across three levels of risk classification.  
'No Fly Zones' - These Are The Most Dangerous Airspaces To Travel Through
 https://www.statista.com/chart/25151/commercial-airspace-by-risk-level/  
 You will find more infographics at Statista[7]  
 The first and most severe classification is Level 1 which involves a moderate risk level where airlines are strongly 
urged to avoid the airspace entirely. The classification is due to highly unstable events on the ground and the 
possibility that factions possess MANPADS (man-portable air-defense systems) or other surface-to-air missiles. 
Libya, Iran, Syria and Yemen are currently classified as being a Level 1 risk.  
 Level 2 involves assessed warnings for certain airspace sections or altitudes with Afghanistan, Belarus, North 
Korea and Ukraine among the countries classified as such.  
 Level 3 is the least severe classification which involves a state of caution where a security review should be 
conducted before flights operate within a country's airspace.

 With the start of the summer travel period, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is seeing growing passenger numbers 
despite coronavirus-led travel restrictions, per a Reuters report[2]. 
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Ryanair's chief executive officer, Michael O'Leary, stated that bookings 
had significantly recovered over the last eight weeks, with increased number of bookings to Portugal and other 
popular destinations from Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries. 
Per the report, O'Leary said, "Traffic is mushrooming and a lot of that folk are families going on summer holidays to 
the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy." He further added that the airline expected to fly 80-100 million 
passengers in fiscal 2022. Due to travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by several European governments, the 
airline carried a mere 27.5 million passengers in fiscal 2021, compared with 149 million in fiscal 2020. Ryanair

 [Sava Jankovic, MA (University of Warsaw), MSc (Warsaw University of Technology), PhD (University of Dundee) 
is Researcher at the Institute of Legal Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences. His interests include the law of 
statehood, international responsibility, human rights law and peaceful resolution of conflicts.] 
The aftermath of the incident: Proceedings before national and international bodies and politically charged 
sanctions 
The Ryanair forced landing incident provoked both questions of potential Belarus's responsibility under national and 
international laws and ways of executing it. In addition, a debate over the sanctions emerged, in particular, whether 
they were taken not prematurely (before establishing the actual violation by a judicial or para-judicial body) and 
whether they were not too severe.  
The ICAO's probe 
To start with the first set of issues, there are a few possible ways of examining the incident and bringing to justice 
those responsible. The foremost avenue is obviously within the organization concerned with civil aviation, namely 
the International Civil Aviation Organization. 
In accordance with Article 54 of this Chicago Convention, the incident, upon referral by any contracting State, must 
be clarified by the ICAO Council - one of the governing bodies of this structure (the second is the Assembly). The 
Council is obliged to ask the Belarusian government to make a statement, and then report to the Assembly about 
this incident and its reasons, and then, if the ICAO Assembly sees it fit, it can impose sanctions on Belarus, issue a 
reprimand or make some other decision. Recalling Article 55 (e) of the Chicago Convention, the ICAO's 
Councildecided[1]at its urgent videoconference meeting on 27 of May to undertake a fact-finding investigation of 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part II
this event, and in this connection requested the ICAO Secretariat to prepare an interim report to the Council. 
Belarusian Director of the Aviation Department, who participated in the meeting, 'urged[2]to conduct a fact-finding 
investigation in accordance with the Chicago Convention and to refrain from making conclusions until such 
investigation is complete'. 
Nevertheless, Belarus, in order to defend its statement on a suspected bomb, will have to prove it, provide specific 
data: what kind of information it was, from whom it came. To say that they got it from the special services would not 
be enough. And if Belarus has nothing to put on the table to confirm its version, it will have a hard time. According 
to the German air lawexpert[3], Elmar Giemulla, it is very likely that the Assembly will issue a warning to Belarus 
that in case of a repetition of such an incident, the country will be excluded from ICAO. It would be rash on the part 
of the Belarusian government not to listen to this, because if it happens a second time, they will no longer have a 
chance. And the exclusion from ICAO means that it will be extremely difficult for the country to carry out 
international air transportation. 
National investigations 
National law enforcement institutions are likewise capable of launching the investigation into the incident. In 
Belarus, the Investigative Committee branch of Minsk's Oktyabrsky District haslaunched[4]a criminal case into 'a 
knowingly false report about danger in line with part 1, Article 340 of the Criminal Code'. In Poland, legal 
proceedings have beeninitiated[5]by the Prosecutor General of Poland under Articles 166 (suspicion of a crime) and 
189 (the use of deception and threats to take control of an aircraft and imprisonment) of the Polish penal code. The 
Lithuanian public prosecutor's office opened a pre-trial investigation under Article 251 'Hijacking an Aircraft' and 
Article 100 'Treatment of Persons Prohibited under International Law' of the Lithuanian criminal code. Furthermore, 
the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)leads[6]an independent enquiry, while closely liaising with the Polish 
and Lithuanian authorities, given the US passengers were present on board. The multiplicity of currently conducted 
national probes, as well as those to be potentially initiated by the interested parties (the flight commenced in 
Greece, the company is Irish), only seemingly facilitates the investigation. In reality, criminal jurisdiction issue will 
undoubtedly arise among all involved, and proper communication, including with the ICAO and Interpol will be 
required. 
Avenues for international litigation 
In addition to solving the dispute by the ICAO bodies, unsatisfied parties may, pursuant to Article 84 of the Chicago 
Convention, forward the case to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal agreed upon with the other parties or to the ICJ. This 
would, of course, pertain exclusively to the breach of the aforementioned Article 3bis (b) of the Chicago Convention. 
In reference to utilizing the ICJ in the instance of providing false information by the Air Traffic Control, prohibited by 
Article 1(1)(e) of the Montreal Convention linked to the positive obligation of not providing such information under 
Article 10 (for instance, taking due measures to verify it), the avenue isipso jureclosed for other Parties, as Belarus 
placed a reservation to Article 14 of the Montreal Convention, allowing for use of the adjudication in case of 
potential disagreements. A furtherpossibility[7]of legal action arises from the violation of the rights of the flag state of 
the aircraft (in this case Poland), who should have been asked for permission or extradition of the sought people by 
the Belorussian state, however, it seems unlikely due to form of security operation. 
(Dis)proportionally severe sanctions 
Western countries, disinclined to be entangled in rather long and perhaps even uncertain legal processes, harried 
with unilateral (or alliance) sanctions. However, this could be perceived as arbitrary administration of law, given that 
neither national nor international investigations have not been completed. Many EU countries decided to close their 
airspace to the Belorussian aero transport, which was evidenced on 26 of May when Belavia plane from Minsk to 
Barcelona turned back just before reaching Poland. Forbidding the national carrier to enter another state's airspace 
must be preceded by withdrawing the consent to fly by suspension of a bilateral or multilateral agreement, yet 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part II
usually by issuingNOTAM[8]. Closing the airspace is naturally a sovereigndecision[9]of states, as there is no 
similarity to the law of sea's 'free passage' principle, yet can be considered as an act deteriorating international 
relations. Still, the Chicago Convention in Article 87 foresees a penalty in the form of not allowing the operation of 
an airline of a contracting State in the airspace of other states only if the airline concerned is not conforming to a 
final decision of the Council. In 2018, the ICJruled[10]that the ICAO is a responsible organization for regulating civil 
air traffic over contracting States and backed Qatar's endeavour to declare the blockage of its airspace by the 
surrounding Arab states contrary to international law and to demand financial compensation. 
A further set of sanctions relates to encouraging EU carriers not to use the Belorussian airspace, which may have 
devastating effects for the economy given that Belarus receivesincome[11]from airlines that enter its airspace of up 
to €70,000 (60,000) each day. In addition, a three-billion-euro EU investment package for Belarus wasfrozen[12]in 
connection to the incident and the USre-imposed[13]full blocking sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned 
enterprises previously granted relief under a series of General Licenses by the Treasury Department. All in all, the 
economic impact of the sanctions is great, but the sanctions' effects on human rights, in particular, of the 
Byelorussians, issignificant[14]too. It might be argued that the inflicted sanctions are disproportionate to the scale of 
the incident and were determined largely by the pursued geopolitical agenda of bringing down the Lukashenko 
regime. In other words, the primary reason for such severe sanctions is rather the repression of the opposition than 
merely the air incident (the pane, after all, continued its flight to Vilnius). Three main arguments substantiate this 
thesis a) the history of sanctions imposed on the Lukashenko regime for the 'mistreatment' of the opposition, b) the 
very political statements, which make it clear that the geopolitical agenda is at stake, and c) the inaction of the 
Western world in more grave situations, exposing larger violations of human rights. 
Regarding the first argument, it is evident that whenever opposition activists are targeted in Belarus, an immediate 
harsh reaction follows from the Western world. In 2004, an embargo on arms was imposed by the EU as a result of 
the disappearance of two opposition politicians. In 2020, a travel ban and asset freeze against 88 individuals and 
seven organisations wereinstituted[15]by the EU in relation to the 'intimidation of peaceful demonstrators' and 
allegedly forged presidential elections. 
With reference to the second argument, the initial harsh language of unprecedented act of'state terrorism'[16]or 
effective 'aviation piracy, state sponsored[17]' was soon supplemented with the accusations ofharassments[18]of 
journalists and 'shockingassault[19]on human rights and freedom of the press'. The EU Council'sconclusions[20]of 
24 May not only 'strongly condemn the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on 23 May 2021 
endangering aviation safety' but also 'demand the immediate release of Raman Pratasevich' (co-founder of the 
opposition Nexta channel on Telegram, used for mobilising street protests) and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
Thestatement[21]by the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki of 28 of May is clothed in an akin political accent 
as it, apart from calling for a 'credible international investigation into the events of May 23', demands 'immediately 
release all political prisoners, and enter into a comprehensive and genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the 
democratic opposition and civil society groups that leads to the conduct of free and fair Presidential elections under 
OSCE auspices and monitoring'. 
As per the third argument, that is, the incomparably heighten reaction of the Western leaders to the current incident 
than to other even more serious occurrences, one could mention the downing of a Ukrainian commercial airliner by 
Iran in 2020, which went largely unsanctionedand unremedied, asobserved[22]by the UN Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. In the same vein, the Belarusian incident brought about considerably 
aggrandized consequences for the regime than to those responsible for the recent Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which 
involvedbloodshed[23]and massive infrastructuredestructions[24]. 
Having said that, although the safety and comfort of the passengers of the Ryaianr flight 4978 could have been 
important for the Western leaders as well as that the fact that similar incidents (including justifications) do not repeat 
in other parts of the world, it is the democratic values of the freedom of speech, media and thought, which greatly fit 
within the agenda of ousting the 'undemocratic' Lukashenko regime, that underpin the sanctions policy. Thus, the 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part II
sanctions could be considered disproportionate to the incident, yet proportionate to broader politically envisaged 
goals. The question, however, remains how effective the sanction policy will be in the long run, what will be the 
response of Russia, and whether in the end, it will lead to the desired or contra effects. 
Conclusion 
The situation surrounding the incident of an 'emergency' landing of the Ryanair flight 4978in Minsk on 23 of May 
2021 has more political than legal overtones. It could be inferred from the most plausible motive for grounding the 
plane by the Belorussian government as well as from the reaction of the Western world thereto. International law, 
on its side, was used as an instrument for justifying and denouncing the grounding, whichnota bene,is generally the 
case when a scandal of such dimensions erupts. From what we know so far,the whole action was most likely 
politically motivated - it is hard to believe that Belorus would deliberately place on itself the burden of a security 
operation, especially that the plane almost reached its destination in Lithuania. In that regard, Belorus breached 
international law, in particular the Montreal Convention. It, however, remains debatable whether the action of 
grounding the plane apart from being an uncommon or unfriendly act would also be illegal, had Belarus not 
provided purportedly false information on the bomb, but explained its action in terms of arresting the fugitive sought 
for serious offences, who found himself within the confines of state's criminal jurisdiction. We seem to lack a firm 
legal stance on that and such clarification would be more than welcome on this occasion from the ICAO Council or 
later by an authoritative body engaged with international law. This is essential for the unencumbered air transit, 
security of the passengers, friendship and understanding among nations and, most notably, order in international 
civil aviation. Potential future litigation of the incident will undoubtedly be cumbersome due to the limited legal 
avenues and complicated fact-checking task. Irrespective of the potential litigation, the incident will be used by 
Belorus and the West to carry out their political agendas. For Belorus, it means the maintenance of power by all 
available means, mainly based on suppressing the opposition. For the West, it means the continuation of toppling 
the Lukashenko regime, by imposing very severe sanctions.

Jun 22, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Lawmakers have praised wide-ranging sanctions against the Lukashenko regime, with Germany's foreign minister 
saying "the EU has delivered." Minsk has vowed to protect its citizens and business from the "hostile actions."EU 
figures admire Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn for his directness. And he didn't hold back after 
Monday's decision to target key sectors of the Belarus economy with fresh sanctions. 
"We are clearly showing that Stalinism and state terror no longer have a place in the 21st century," said Asselborn, 
referring to Minsk's forced diversion of a Ryanair passenger plane and detention of a dissident journalist in May.  
He had previously said that any sanctions imposed on the country must "hurt" the regime of President Alexander 
Lukashenko. 
The new economic sanctions will target seven sectors dominated by state-run companies that are believed to play a 
pivotal role in buoying Lukashenko's regime. These include the potash and fertilizer industries, two of the country's 
biggest export products; Belarus is the world's second-largest producer of potash. 
The sanctions will also target the petrochemical and tobacco industries, financial services and dual-use goods, such 
as surveillance technology, so far exempt from the existing arms embargo. High-ranking officials now also face 
asset freezes and are barred from entering and transiting though the EU. Some 160 individuals will be affected by 
this measure. 
The United Kingdom, the United States and Canada have joined the EU sanctions plan, which should amplify its 
effect. 
Minsk condemns 'hostile actions' 
On Tuesday, Belarus said the measures amounted to "economic war'' and threatened to retaliate. 
"We have repeatedly stated that sanctions negatively affect the interests of citizens, they are counterproductive and 
vicious," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, describing the sanctions as "hostile actions."  
It added that Belarus "is able and will do everything possible to protect its citizens and business entities" and the 
restrictions "will not have the desired effect." 
But exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who had been calling for hash sanctions against the 
regime, expressed satisfaction with the coordinated EU effort.  
EU sanctions on Belarus go 'beyond symbolic'
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also praised the outcome, saying "the EU has delivered." Maas said EU 
sanctions will deal a serious blow to Belarus' state-run companies and "dry up" the regime's money supply. 
Petras Austrevicius, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, told DW that the sanctions will send "very 
powerful and even timely message to the regime." The lawmaker expects the EU to find new ways to support the 
Belarussian civil society, which he said still urgently needs the EU's backing. 
Austria fears an economic hit 
When EU figures met last week in Brussels for talks regarding the potential sanctions, Austria seemed reluctant to 
impose the punitive measures. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, however, later denied the 
objections, saying Vienna was now taking a strong stand against the regime. 
"We have to tighten the thumbscrews after this callous action of state air piracy," Schallenberg told reporters on 
Monday. "We want to hit the state-affiliated economic sector, those responsible, not the people in Belarus, who are 
suffering anyway." 
Schallenberg stressed, however, that the sanctions would have to stand up in court, as the European Court of 
Justice has been called upon to previously assess the legality of such measures. 
The reason for Austria's apparent resistance to tougher sanctions? Some 80 Austrian companies have close 
business ties to Belarus, and would likely be adversely affected by any harsh economic measures. Austria is the 
second-biggest source of foreign direct investment in the country after Russia. Austrian banks — chiefly a 
subsidiary of Raiffeisen Bank International — provide 80% of foreign loans. In addition, the country's mobile 
network operator A1 Telekom Austria operates the Belarusian telecommunications network. 
EU 'speaking the language of power' 
Reinhard Bütikofer, an EU lawmaker with the Greens and the group's foreign affairs spokesperson, said the bloc 
had done well to go beyond symbolic measures to adopt "serious sanctions" to deter other states. 
Bütikofer said the sanctions would require EU member states to make certain concessions. "You cannot cook an 
omelet without breaking eggs," he said. He added that further measures, such as excluding Belarus from the 
SWIFT banking system, could be imposed if needed. By and large, however, the MEP expressed satisfaction that 
the EU was now "speaking the language of power." 
Belarus opposition leader Tsikhanouskaya, however, warned the EU that the Lukashenko regime may attempt to 
entice Europe into doing business with it in exchange for freeing political prisoners. Speaking on Monday, she once 
again highlighted the dangers faced by the country's pro-democracy movement, showing a bullet fragment that had 
been removed from a protester's lung — the young activist had been shot by Belarussian police while attending a 
demonstration. 
The center-right European People's Party, meanwhile, has called for an international tribunal to try Lukashenko for 
crimes against humanity. Party leader Manfred Weber recently drew attention to the fact that Minsk is allegedly 
sending migrants from places like Iraq and Syria into Lithuania to exert pressure on the Baltic state, which has long 
supported the Belarus opposition. 
Weber said he welcomed the mobilization of Frontex agents in the area, saying on Twitter that Lukashenko would 
not get to decide which migrants may or may not enter the EU.

 [Sava Jankovic, MA (University of Warsaw), MSc (Warsaw University of Technology), PhD (University of Dundee) 
is Researcher at the Institute of Legal Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences. His interests include the law of 
statehood, international responsibility, human rights law and peaceful resolution of conflicts.] 
Basic facts 
The Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius on 23 of May was forced to land in Minsk by the Belorussian MIG-
29 fighter under the guise of a terrorist attack. The Belorussian regime claimed there was a bomb on board the 
plane, while in reality none was found. On the other hand, a Byelorussian oppositionist and his girlfriend, who were 
among the passengers, got detained during the 'security operation'. The whole affair turned into a diplomatic 
scandal, accusations of Belarus breaching international air laws, the suspension of flights through the Belarusian 
airspace linked with the suspension of operating permits for Belorussian national carrier Belavia as well as 
economic and person-targeted sanctions. 
Was the diversion of the Ryanair plane by the Belarusian army in accordance with international law? 
The paramount question surrounding the incident is whether the Belarusian state had a right to divert the passenger 
plane and command its landing in Minsk. 
In legal terms, every state exercises sovereignty over its airspace, thus a civil plane using its airspace falls within its 
jurisdiction. According to Article 1 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention[1]), a 
state has 'complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory'. Pursuant to Article 3 bis (b), a 
state is entitled to require landing at a designated airport of a civil aircraft flying above its territory only when the 
latter is flying 'without authority'(which was not the case with the Ryanair flight), or 'if there are reasonable grounds 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part I
to conclude that it is being used for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of this Convention'. In addition, under 
Article 5 of the Convention, contracting states agree that all aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air 
services are entitled to non-stop flights across their territory. However, Article 5 contains a reservation providing that 
any participating state reserves the right to require landing. In that regard, the action of redirecting a plane and 
indicating the airport for landing by the Belarussian authorities has strong legal underpinnings. 
Nevertheless, operations of this calibre cannot be carried out without a compelling reason, as they would endanger 
the safety of civil aviation, alongside the comfort and trust of the passengers. AsJackson and 
Tzanakopoulos[2]rightly point out, stopping a vehicle on land is a different and customary situation, while breaking 
the flow of an aircraft demands a solid reason. The Belarussian side argued that there was a bomb on board the 
plane, which was sufficient ground for taking the measure. Hence, the Belarusian action complied with international 
law norms,ergoArticle 3 bis (b) of the Chicago Convention. The Belorussian side clarified that it possessed the 
information about the danger and forwarded it to the Ryanair crew. Aksamentov, director of the Institute of Air and 
Space Law AEROHELP,stated[3]that the emergency landing occurred according to the rules, 'even if the 
information about the mining of the plane did not come from the crew, but from some third party, including an 
anonymous one'. 
On the other hand, there are indications that cast doubts on the official version provided by Belarus. First, why did 
they decide to divert the plane, which almost reached its destination in Vilnius to a further airport in Minsk? Second, 
had the operation be undertaken with the use of a military fighter or could it be simply carried out on land, upon 
reaching the final destination shortly? In that case, one may wonder if the operation was conducted with the 
principle of necessity and proportionality demanded by Appendix 2 of the Chicago Convention, stating that 
interception should be undertaken only as a last resort, but the Belarusian military jet took off immediately. This 
might have triggered fear in passengers, make the pilot nervous and put the whole plane at hazard. Thirdly, there 
arereports[4]that Belorrusian KGB agents were on board, who followed the Belarusian oppositionist, asserted an 
emergency landing and disembarked in Minsk. In consequence, no explosives were found, but the opposition 
journalist and his girlfriend were captured. This may reveal a real motive for the instructed landing. 
The incident should inevitably be investigated correctly, but if the presumptions of an orchestrated landing will 
confirm, Belarus may indeed be accused of breaching the respective provisions of the Chicago Convention, and, in 
fact, misusing it, which is proscribed by Article 4. If it turns out that Belarus had contracted agents who provided 
false information about the bomb as well as cooperated with the Belorussian KGB agents, it will be considered as 
an accomplice in the event and bear responsibility pursuant to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Belarus 
might also be accused of contravening the provisions of the 1970 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful 
Seizure of Aircraft (theHague Convention 1970[5]), which it joined in 1971, by virtue of not apprehending and 
punishing passengers (agents) who allegedly insisted on landing, and thus were considered as those attempting to 
take control over the flight in light of Article 1 (a) of the treaty. Furthermore, Belarus might be accused of violating 
Article 10 of the 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation (the 
Montreal Convention[6]) because it did not take'all practicable measures'to prevent the commission of an offence 
outlined in Article 1(1)(e) of the Convention, that is, unlawful and intentional communication of false information (to 
the pilot by the Air Traffic Control), thereby'endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight'. Yet, in both cases, the 
Belarussian state would be behind and thus the question of immunityratione materiaemay arise. 
International organizations and states voiced their concerns about the potential violation of international law by 
Belarus. The ICAOclaimed[7]that the forced landing'could be in breach of the Chicago Convention on International 
Civil Aviation', while the NATO Secretary-Generalstated[8]that grounding of theflight constitutes a 'serious and 
dangerous incident which requires international investigation'. The majority of the Western politicians were more 
concrete about the breach and the ensuing sanctions. The EU Commission PresidentUrsula von der 
Leyendescribed[9]the incident as 'utterly unacceptable', stating that 'any violation of international air transport rules 
must bear consequences'.Latvian Foreign Minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs,referred[10]to the incident as 'contrary to 
international law' and said that the reaction should be 'strong and effective'. The tendency of the Western states 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part I
towards a harsher language was repeated at the UN Security Council closed-door meeting on Belarus called for 26 
May. In aletter[11], six members (Estonia, France, Ireland, Norway, Great Britain and the United States) underlined 
that the interception of the Ryanair flight was 'a blatant attack on international civilian aviation safety and European 
security.' The fact, that the remaining members of the Security Council (India, Russia, China, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Viet Nam) did not sign reflects the political colour of the incident, 
described in the second part of this post. 
The card Belarus did not want to play 
Belarusian official stance is that it acted in accordance with international air law while performing its action of 
grounding the passenger plane. President Lukashenko whilespeaking[12]to the parliament on 26 of May revealed 
that the message about the bomb was communicated by the Belarus Air Traffic Control originated in Switzerland 
and that the military jet did not in any way force the Ryanair plane, and it was sent for security reasons only, so that 
the potential explosion does not affect people on the ground and premises (since, as he claimed, they could not do 
much about the onboard passengers). In a nutshell, the possibility of a purported terrorist attack justified the 
operation. 
Assuming that it is just a cover for Belorus's genuine intentions - arresting the opposition figure - as voiced by the 
Western world, it would be interesting to ponder over another possibility for justifying the action, which Belarus did 
not want to initiate, namely the conservative perception of sovereignty. This might have triggered a lesser backlash 
by the Western leaders, who had felt additionally irritated by the attempted deception manoeuvre regarding the 
bomb on board. 
Belarus is known for its rather Hegelian approach to sovereignty, in which a state has considerable control of its 
citizens and territory and where people enjoy fewer freedoms or pardons. There is no need to mention that Belarus 
is the only European state that is not a member of the Council of Europe and thus a non-party to the European 
Convention on Human Rights for the main reason that it still allows capital punishment. In states like Belarus, 
plotting or treachery against the government is considered an unfriendly act engendering the most severe 
consequences. Mr Protasevich since November 2020figures[13]on the government's list alongside 700 people as 
an'individual involved in terrorist activities'and faces charges on at least three criminal courts. If convicted of 
terrorism, he could face the death penalty. But if one looks a few decades behind, the same will recall how strictly 
espionage was treated in the whole of Europe and how draconian punishments could be expected for it. As a 
matter of fact, many Western states still have constitutionally envisaged high penalties for espionage or serious 
deeds against the interest of a state, which include the attempt at overthrowing the government. Yet, they don't 
observe them in a literal way and draw a considerable distinction between peaceful protests and attempts at 
overthrowing the government, in stark contrast to Belarus. With that in mind, the arrest of an'enemy of the 
state'could have been an expected act in Belarus, even if that involved a forceful landing of a passenger plane. 
One could easily imagine a comparable action of the US forces in case a wanted person would found himself within 
the US jurisdiction. Several'questionable'examples involving the display of sovereign powers could be furnished to 
this end. First, the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, deputy board chair at Huawei, in 2018 at the Vancouver International 
Airport, which, according to her, was a plotted action of the US and Canadian agencies. Second, in 2013, a Bolivian 
president's plane was grounded in Vienna under the suspicion that Edward Snowden, sought by the US for 
revealing a number of secret documents from the US National Security Agency, was among the passengers. 
Besides, there is a plethora of incidents related to states' non-consensual operations in other states' territories 
under the pretext of protecting vital national interests linked to the arrest or killing of wanted people, which is a 
much greater breach of international law. This was the case of a) the arrest of Adolf Eichmann by the Mossad in 
Argentina in 1960, which ended in a UN Security Council resolution138[14]condemning Israeli action; b) the 
interception of the EgyptAir aeroplane by the US Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighters in 1985 in order to arrest terrorists

 Germany is keen to broaden the economic sanctions placed on Minsk as EU foreign ministers gather in 
Luxembourg. Heiko Maas has also called for renewed efforts over the Turkey refugee deal.EU foreign ministers 
meeting in Luxembourg on Monday are set to increase the pressure on Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko 
by blacklisting dozens more supporters of his regime. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has called for broad economic sanctions against Minsk in light of the forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight in order to detain a dissident journalist. 
"I think additional sanctions against Belarus are unavoidable," Maas told German newspaper Die Welt. 
"We should extend the sanctions to parts of the Belarusian economy, such as the potash industry or the energy 
sector. And we should deprive the government in Minsk of the possibility to raise funds within the EU by issuing 
government bonds," he said. 
Forced landing causes widespread turbulence 
Belarusian strongman Lukashenko sparked widespread outrage by dispatching a fighter jet on May 23 to intercept a 
flight from Greece to Lithuania, eventually forcing the plane to land in Minsk, before arresting dissident journalist 
Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
The European Union subsequently blocked Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc, while it has also stopped 
carriers from its 27 nations from using Belarus' air space. 
According to EU diplomats, speaking to various news agencies, the foreign ministers convening in Luxembourg are 
likely to formally agree to placing more than 80 additional individuals and entities on an assets freeze, as well as 
imposing a visa ban upon them. 
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994. He has so far managed to shrug off the pressure from the West, while 
retaining the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who insists she won last year's national election, will talk with 
the ministers in Brussels ahead of their summit on Monday. 
Refugee arrangement with Turkey under the microscope 
Meanwhile, Germany's Foreign Ministry is calling for a renewed focus on the EU's refugee deal with Turkey. 
"We need an update to our migration cooperation with Turkey," Heiko Maas told Die Welt. 
"In all the difficulties we have with the Turkish government, we must acknowledge that the country has taken on a 
not inconsiderable migration burden for us," Maas said. 
A new accord would likely mean additional funding for Turkey, he said. 
EU foreign ministers mull increased sanctions against Belarus
"I don't want to put any numbers out into the world, but it is completely clear that it won't work without money," Maas 
said. 
The refugee deal between the EU and Turkey includes provisions for Ankara to crack down on unauthorized 
migration to the bloc and for Greece to send migrants who have reached the Aegean islands illegally back to 
Turkey. 
In return, the EU takes one recognized Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian sent back. Brussels also 
provides financial support to the homeland of the refugees in order to take care of them.

 Sources say new measures have been approved after Belarus authorities forced a Ryanair flight to land in Minsk 
and arrested a dissident journalist who was on board.European Union member states agreed to impose fresh 
sanctions on Belarus on Wednesday over last month's forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and arrest of dissident 
journalist Raman Pratasevich, according to diplomats cited by news agencies. 
The sanctions have been approved by EU ambassadors and are expected to be adopted by the bloc's foreign 
ministers next week. 
Reuters cited a diplomat as saying the new measures targeted at least seven individuals linked to the Belarus 
aviation sector.  
The EU has already blocked Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc and stopped carriers from its 27 nations from

 After a low point in US-Russian relations, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be 
meeting face-to-face. China is one of the reasons.Biden wants to spend time in a room with Putin and the 
translators to better understand what drives the Russian president and what the real issues are, said Ian Bremmer, 
a US foreign affairs expert and Time magazine columnist. That's very important for him, it's where his empathy 
comes from — if Biden has a superpower, that is it, the columnist told DW. 
By February 2021, relations between the two nuclear powers had reached a 30-year low. Biden had called Putin a 
killer, which triggered outrage in Moscow. Suddenly, however, things changed and plans were made for a private 
meeting in a neutral space, in Switzerland. 
The US seeks to normalize relations with Russia — mainly because of China, according to Raimund Krmer, who 
teaches international politics at the University of Potsdam. "The main focus of Biden's European trip serves the 
greater goal of forging alliances against China," he told DW, adding that much is evident in the G7, NATO and EU 
summits as well as in the meeting with the Russian president. 
The list of topics up for debate between Biden and Putin is long: disarmament treaties, the Ukraine conflict, Syria, 
Iran's nuclear program, Libya, Afghanistan. Not to mention human rights violations, the suppression of the free 
press and opposition in Russia, pro-government hacking attacks, and the hijacking of the Ryanair plane by Russia's 
ally Belarus. One topic will not be on the agenda, although it has become the focus of American foreign policy: 
China. 
Bremmer said that while it is unlikely Biden and Putin will talk directly about China, it is clear the US sees China as 
a key antagonist on the global stage, which in turn influences US strategy with respect to Russia. 
US favors steady relationship with Russia 
The ongoing confrontation between the United States and the People's Republic of China came to a head shortly 
before Biden's trip to Europe. Three days before the G7 summit, the US announced it would approve a trade 
agreement with Taiwan — a provocation for China. A day later, the US Senate passed a $244 billion (€201 billion) 
package of legislation to combat China's technological dominance. One day before the summit, US Defense 
Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Pentagon to bring more of a focus on strategy on China. 
Biden doesn't like Putin, nor does he think Russia is of incredible strategic value, but the reality of US-China 
relations means that we would rather not have big problems with the Russians, Bremmer said. 
Ralf Fücks, director of the Berlin-based Center for Liberal Modernity think tank, takes a similar view, arguing that 
clearly, "China is present in the background." The US has no interest in escalating the conflict with Moscow, the 
What the Biden-Putin summit has to do with China
Russia expert added. "It's really just a side issue for them that interupts their attempts to consolidate their strategic 
positions vis-a-vis Beijing," he said, adding that it's a strategic option for Putin to expand cooperation with China, 
which he has already started doing. 
Getting too close to China is 'dangerous for Russia' 
Since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow and Beijing have strengthened their bilateral ties. The 
halt of a significant portion of foreign direct investment in Russia was an immediate consequence of western 
sanctions. Attempts to offset that loss by turning to China have been only partially successful. The Russian 
economy has been stagnating for years. Real incomes are falling, while frustration among the population is on the 
rise. 
Russia is trying to participate in China's economic growth. New pipelines to China are under construction and 
Russia has been supplying the Chinese with modern weapons systems that Beijing is not getting from the West. 
"Russia is helping the Chinese build a military satellite defense system," according to Sarah Pagung of the German 
Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). "But they are very cautious because in the end, of course, they don't want 
the Chinese to simply copy military technology that the Russians have developed and then become independent," 
the DGAP Russia expert argued. 
It is the authoritarian common ground that drives Putin to Xi Jinping's side, said Ralf Fücks of the Center for Liberal 
Modernity. "There is, in effect, a new international of authoritarian powers that see a common opponent in liberal 
democracy and the liberal world order." Russia, he added, fears China more than it sees China as a strategic 
partner. 
"Getting too close to China is dangerous for Russia," Victoria Zhuravleva, the head of North American studies at 
Russia's University of Human Sciences in Moscow, told DW. The United States could provide a counterweight to 
China for Russia to move between, the political scientist said, adding that could be a way of balancing the two 
powers. 
Walking the seesaw of power politics is the position Russia seems to seek, a center among many in a multi-polar 
world. "Russia's favorite position is still that of a kind of mediator between Asia and the West," said Katharina 
Bluhm, director of the Institute for Eastern European Studies at Freie Universitt Berlin. "The mediator role is an 
illusion today, partly because China is unlikely to grant it to Russia." 
We don't know what the Chinese government thinks about the meeting, said Yawei Liu, a China expert with the 
Carter Center thinktank , adding that unrest is increasing among Chinese academics on social media. Biden's 
decision to meet Putin worries the Chinese, he said, it is a smart move. The US will find it increasingly difficult to 
deal with Russia and China at the same time, according to Yawei Liu, so the motto is "divide and rule." 
Biden's messages to Russia and Europe 
Not all experts feel confrontation with China is what drives Biden's summit with Putin, however. Kristine Berzina of 
the German Marshall Fund said the main purpose of Biden's entire European trip is a show of solidarity with US 
allies. Russia, she said, is perceived as a destabilizing force. "The priority will be to signal that the US will not 
continue to accept Russia's increasingly threatening and belligerent behavior," Berzina said. 
The United States may be focused on China, but Washington is aware that Russia is capable of wreaking 
significant havoc and destabilizing Western democracies in Europe and America in the process," said Torrey 
Taussig of the Harvard Kennedy School. 
However, the simple fact that he is invited to a meeting is a major domestic political success for Putin, said Pagung, 
who added that the Russian media portray it as a kind of "recognition of Russia's great power status." Putin, the 
DGAP expert said, has nothing to lose. Biden, on the other hand, will have to make his position on Russia crystal 
clear and point out Russian wrongdoing in order to be successful.

UN GATE, June 9 - Right after dissident blogger Pratasevich was grabbed off a Ryan Air flight forced to land in 
Belarus, many including the US spoke. 
 But for more than a full day, nothing from Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General who rarely takes questions 
and even had the Press which asked him about the mass killings in Cameroonthrown out[9]of the UN. Alerthere[10]; 
new Belarus Blues songhere.[11] 
 On June 9, the Committee to Protect Journalists held a Zoom press conference withVolha Siakhovich of BAJon the 
topic, and Inner City Press submitted two questions: 
 "Question from Inner City Press: Do you think the Biden Administration's decision to limit to avague[12]"members 
of the news media doing their jobs" protection against gag orders and surveillance undermine its ability to fully 
pursue the issue of press freedom in Belarus? Likewise, do you think the UN Secretariat's failure to have any 
content neutral media accreditation and access rules undermine the ability of it and those responsible to raise 
Belarus's abuses, to the degree the will to do so exists in anything but the vaguest terms?" 
 The response,photohere,[13]by CPJ'sGypsy Guilln Kaiser,included that CPJ has no comment on the UN's 
accreditation policies. How not, if they cite to and use the UN? In fact, the UN Group of Friends was cited. 
 Will CPJ's solicitude for UN censorship end with its change in leadership, also announced on June 9? Watch this 
site. 
 Late and hypocritical, given that they have done nothing about Guterresbanning[14]Inner City Press now for 1073 
days amid its questions, this: "The co-chairs of the United Nations Group of Friends for the Protection of Journalists 
- Greece, France and Lithuania - and the undersigned Members of the Group of Friends strongly condemn the 
forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on May 23, 2021, prompted by Belarusian authorities in order to 
arrest and detain independent journalist Raman Pratasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega... 
 There can be no Press Freedom when there is fear. [See seethis[15]andthis[16]at UN.] 
 Signed, Co-chairs of the UN Group of Friends for the Protection of Journalists, Ambassadors, Permanent 
Representatives of Greece, France and Lithuania  
Before Biden Putin Meet, CPJ Q&A on Belarus Has Info But No Comment on UN Press Ban
 Annex: Co-signatories members of the Group of Friends (in alphabetical order): Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, 
Costa Rica, Ghana, Latvia, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, USA, Uruguay." 
 On May 28, Guterres' UN Press Briefing Room hosted a press conference, from which Inner City Press was 
banned, in which the grabbing of Pratasevich was called fake news, in response to questions from state media. 
 Inner City Press has asked then incoming UNSC president for JuneEstonia[17]for access, to which there has been 
no response (ACT is just an act) - and it and the Free UN Coalition for Access (FUNCA) will report on all results.

West Adds Belarus To New Axis Of Evil

 Authored by Rick Rozoff via AntiWar.com,[3]  
 So far this year, and ahead of next week's NATO summit in Belgium, the commanders of the Pentagon's Unified 
Combatant Commands and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have denounced and thundered against 
Russia and China as rivals and adversaries in every part of the world, with Iran and North Korea identified as 
second-tier threats. All four are treated as nuclear powers, real or imagined. They are the Axis of Evil of 2021, 
supplanting that of 2001.  
 In recent weeks a fifth nation has been added: Belarus. The momentum to brand it as such has been mounting 
since last August when the West supported presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya against the then-
incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko. It reached a record level after the Belarusian government's landing of 
a Ryanair passenger plane with opposition figure Roman Protasevich on board last month.NATO has taken up the 
refrain with a vengeance[4], speaking in menacing terms not heard since the depth of the Cold War of a threat 
posed by "Minsk and Moscow"to Europeand the world. (Fifty years ago it would have been the Free World.)  
 Belarus is the only European nation (excluding microstates) except Russia that is not a NATO member or aspiring 
member, which doesn't host regular NATO- and U.S.-led war games and which has not supplied troops for NATO 
operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. In short, it's bad example that must bemade an example of.  
 On June 9 Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya spoke by telephone from the Czech Republic, where she now resides, to the 
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and urged it to promote sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union 
against her homeland, which she took the occasion of libeling as "the North Korea of Europe." By her definition 
Belarus could have been a member of the first as well as the current Axis of Evil.  
West Adds Belarus To New Axis Of Evil
 Belarusian press recentlycited Sergei Rachkov[5], chairman of the International Affairs and National Security 
Commission of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of Belarus, warning that the USand its 
European NATO allies are intensifying threats to his country and in doing so adding to tensions in Eastern Europe 
as a whole.  
 He said that the concerted effort by the West - one which in many ways is ominously evocative of the 
characterization of and efforts against Serbia/Yugoslavia in the late 1990s - is in large part motivated by the desire 
to wrest Belarus from its close relationship to Russia, hence eliminating the last remaining buffer between Russia 
and the thirty-nation military mega-bloc.  
 Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: 
 - US, UK and EU must jointly act to pressure Belarus 
 - I've not yet been invited to attend G7 meeting 
 - More sanctions need to be imposed on Belarus government pic.twitter.com/hJJmUwOHrj[6]  
 — TRT World Now (@TRTWorldNow) June 4, 2021[7]  
 Perhaps Rachkov's most incisive observations are these:  
 "Of course, this is a geopolitical strategy. Before that, there was a failed scenario of a color revolution. We saw the 
attempts to disrupt the operation of enterprises, to organize strikes, and draw women and young people into 
protests. But the consolidation of our society around the head of state has put a stop to these processes, the main 
purpose of which was to try to change the behavior of Belarus, which has long been an irritant for the West that 
wants us to play by its rules, with which we conceptually disagree."  
 He added that Belarus recently has chosen, in the face of unrelenting and mounting hostility from the USand the 
European Union, to develop closer relations with China, India and the nations of Southeast Asia, Africa and the 
Middle East.  
 Referring to the likes of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya calling for punitive and onerous sanctions against their own 
country and people, the Belarusian official offered this perspective: "By the way, the very phenomenon is strange, if 
not ugly. I have been working in international relations for a long time, and I do not remember any cases when 
citizens would advocate a better life for people but in reality use methods that can lead to chaos."  
 Many people, in fact most in the world, are still living in the era of the first Axis of Evil; in their minds living in 2001. 
The world of 2021 is far more dangerous, with the very plausible threat of war in Europe that might, that almost 
certainly would, result in a military showdown between the world's two major nuclear powers.

 Exiled Belarusian politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has called for tougher sanctions on Alexander Lukashenko's 
regime. Speaking to DW, the opposition leader also talked about when she could return to Belarus.Belarusian 
opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya — currently living in exile in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius — has called 
for harsher sanctions against strongman Alexander Lukashenko's regime, adding this is the only effective way to 
put pressure on him and his administration. 
"Lukashenko only understands the language of force and economic sanctions. This is the mechanism that should 
be used ... the sanctions must be maximally tough," Tsikhanouskaya told DW in an interview Saturday while on a 
two-day visit to Berlin. 
Widening the net 
The last three rounds of sanctions the European Union imposed on Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian 
officials have been of a "rather moral character," she added. 
Tikhanovskaya expressed hope the next round of punitive measures will involve a greater number of law 
enforcement officials implicated in violence against pro-democracy protesters and opponents of the regime.  
'Europe's last dictator' 
At the end of 2020, Lukashenko — criticized as "Europe's last dictator" — along with his government and closest 
allies, were slapped with sanctions by the European Union following Belarus' disputed August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, and subsequent violent protests. Tikhanovskaya is widely considered by many to be the winner of the 
vote. The EU no longer recognizes Lukashenko to be the head of state. 
Currently, the 88 people sanctioned, including Lukashenko, are banned from entering the EU, and all of their 
European bank accounts have been frozen. In addition to the individuals listed, the sanctions extend to seven state 
enterprises and organizations within the country.  
Current sanctions 'not sufficent' 
Tikhanovskaya is convinced these sanctions are not sufficient, especially after it became clear, she said, that 
Lukashenko and his regime pose a threat not only to Belarusians, but to other states as well. 
Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya says 'harsh' sanctions needed
The 38-year-old was referring to an incident in May where Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane 
on its way from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk. Whilst in the capital, authorities ordered government critic Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega to deplane. Both remain in detention.  
Following the incident, the bloc then imposed sanctions on Belarus, banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU 
airspace. Brussels, in turn, requested EU carriers refrain from flying over Belarusian airspace.  
Appeal to EU politicians 
Tikhanovskaya used her interview on DW's "To the Point" talk show to appeal to European politicians, saying their 
policies "should not be based on what they see on TV, but on people's suffering." 
As of June 12, Belarusian human rights center Viasna reported 477 people are being held as political prisoners 
across the country. One of them, Sergey Tikhanovsky — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's husband — a popular blogger 
who had intended on running for president, but was arrested in May 2020. He currently faces up to 15 years in 
prison on various charges — including organizing mass unrest and inciting hatred.  
Following her husband's imprisonment, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya ran as a presidential candidate. Tsikhanouskaya 
had a strong following and posed a genuine contender to win the vote. However, Lukashenko claimed victory, 
which saw massive demonstrations erupt across the country. Those protesting were violently suppressed. 
Tsikhanouskaya was forced to flee the country.  
Only new elections and a change to the country's political system, Tsikhanouskaya told DW, will allow the country 
to get out of its current political and humanitarian crisis. "Lukashenko can't stay in power," she added. 
While in Europe, Tsikhanouskaya said she got to meet "democratic politicians," politicians "who care about people's 
opinion."  
"Having seen that, I got an idea of what I'd like to have in Belarus." 
On a personal note, Tsikhanouskaya confessed she is often tired and scared. 
"But I understand I have no right to give up, because people who are in jail didn't give up. They now are suffering 
for us," Tikhanovskaya added. 
"Only these people, the families of those repressed in Belarus, have given me the energy to go on." 
Asked whether she believes she can return to Belarus, Tikhanovskaya said: "I'll go back home, as soon as my 
home is ready for me."

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
Say it quickly: FR4978, FR4978, FR4978 
This week, the disinformation narratives regarding the forced landing of flight FR4978 were still skyrocketing. 
Some narratives were repetitive. According to pro-Kremlin media, Belarus offered the Ryanair plane to land at 
Minsk airport after abomb threat[2]. The bomb threat was alreadydebunked[3]two weeks ago, on several grounds. 
For example, the email with the purported threat was receivedafterMinsk air control reached out to the pilots and, 
painfully, for Belarus, Hamasdenied[4]sending it. 
Also, just like in the last weeks, we spotted claims that the Ryanair case shows the West'shypocrisy[5]. A similar 
complaint by pro-Kremlin media is that the West protested about the arrest of Pratasevich, but the incident is similar 
to the one withEvo Morales[6]. Unlike the Belarusian plot however, which involved fighter jets and bomb threats, the 
Bolivian president's flight was brought down bybureaucracy[7]: European nations refused it permission to enter their 
airspace. For more debunking: see thiscase[8]. 
This week brought also new theories. For example, the claim that the investigation of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization into the Ryanair flight incident wasquestionablebecause of the UN'sbias[9]. Also new: the idea that the 
Ryanair flight incident could be a provocation from theUK[10]. Among the reasons supporting this theory were a few 
remarkable ones: 1 ) FR4978 departed from Greece and Greece is in the sphere of influence of the British secret 
service, 2) The Nexta Telegram channel, which Mr Pratasevich ran, is located in Poland and the Polish secret 
services are controlled by the US secret services, which also use the UK as a satellite and 3) Ryanair is an Irish 
company. Quod eratdemonstrandum.Everything irrefutably leads to London. 
Forced Landing FR4978: Necessary, Justified And Schemed By Western Intelligence Agencies
As we pointed outlast week[11], many of these narratives remind us of disinformation campaigns following the 
poisoning and arrest of Russian opposition politicianAlexei Navalny[12], when pro-Kremlin outlets started to claim 
that this blatant act ofstate-sponsored piracy[13]was in fact aprovocationagainst Belarusand that Westernsecret 
services[14]were involved in it. 
Pro-Kremlin media apply the Navalny method to Pratasevich 
The goal of forcing the plane down was to capture Raman Pratasevich. Similar to the disinformation campaigns 
smearing opposition politician Alexei Navalny, are the outrageous claims regarding this Belarusian journalist. Just a 
few of this week's examples: 
The West is using Pratasevich as a weapon againstLukashenka[15]. Conspiracy theory. Similar to: Navalny is used 
as an instrument againstRussia[16]. Both Pratasevich and Navalny are instrumentalised. 
Pratasevich practiced shooting on unarmed Donbascivilians[17]. Smearing. Similar to: Navalny called for killing 
Chechens likecockroaches[18]. Both narratives aim to undermine the credibility of Pratasevich and Navalny and 
imply crimes they never committed. 
Lukashenka had the right to arrestPratasevich[19]. Legal magical realism. Similar to: the ECHR confirmed 
Navalny's prosecution was not politicallymotivated[20]. In both narratives, legal reasoning is conjured up out of thin 
air. 
It is The West, who else? 
If there is turbulence in the world, the pro-Kremlin media's standard response is to blame Western powers, ranging 
from institutions such as the EU and NATO to vaguer entities like the 'Global Elite[21]' or the 'Anglo-Saxons[22]'. 
For instance, one interpretation of the forced landing is that the EU is showing its imperial desires by calling for an 
overthrow inBelarus[23]. We spotted similar claims that the EU is trying to buy outBelarus[24]and the EU is a 
danger to peace and unity on the Europeancontinent[25]. 
It is not just the EU that has imperial desires. According to a claim we spotted, NATObroke agreements[26]with 
Russia and has a hostile plan against Belarus. Related to this claim is the story that approaching the Russian 
border is one of NATO's gross violations of its owncommitments[27]. In a similar fashion, another narrative claims 
that Russia is reacting toprovocative[28]behaviour from the West. 
From a cold war perspective, both nostalgic and obsolete, the driving force behind the West is still the US. 
Consistent with this perspective is the false claim we spotted that the USoverthrew[29]the legitimate government in 
Ukraine and wants to do the same for Russia, China and Hungary. Similar is the claim that theUS[30]controls 
Europe and Ukraine and does not allow Ukraine to live in peace with Russia. 
About Ukraine. According to one claim, this country is used as an instrument to fight against Russia and weaken 
theEU[31]. Somehow forgotten here was that Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Talking about instrumentalising. We 
spotted the same forgetfulness in a complaint about the jersey of the national football team of Ukraine. Their shirt is 
emblazoned with its borders, including Crimea. In the eyes of the pro-Kremlin media however, it features afascist 
slogan[32]. There can be no question that the Ukraine jersey is correct; Crimea is Ukraine and almost no one 
recognises it as Russian. Moreover, no international body recognises the so-called referendum in Crimea, 
ofteninvoked[33]by pro-Kremlin media, not theUN[34], nor theEU[35]. 
Forced Landing FR4978: Necessary, Justified And Schemed By Western Intelligence Agencies
Pro-Kremlin media are not afraid of employing contradicting narratives: It was the right thing to do! It was justified! 
The blame is on the West!

Sanctions have to hurt

Jun 11, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Can the EU topple Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, with new sanctions? Probably not, but after the 
forced landing of Ryanair Flight 4978, further economic and financial sanctions must be inevitable. 
 Belarusian potash exports are vital when it comes to Lukashenko's ability to obtain exchangeable foreign currency, 
are likely to be targeted. Cutting the Lukashenko regime off from international banking networks like Swift is also 
being considered. 
 Regardless of the specifics of any potential sanctions, the EU should adopt tougher punitive measures against 
Lukashenko. Trying to protect him from Putin's clampdown was always make-believe 
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) - an umbrella organization of public radio and TV decided to suspend the 
membership of Belarus TV BTRC, with EBU's board saying, 'We have been particularly alarmed by the broadcast of 
interviews apparently obtained under duress.' 
The statement was in reference to an interview on Minsk-TV with Roman Protasevich, the journalist who was 
arrested by Lukashenko's KGB after the Belarusian Air Force, on Lukashenko's personal orders, hijacked the 
Ryanair flight and forced it to land in the Belarusian capital Minsk. In the interview, Protasevich shows visible signs 
of torture. The EBU opted to block the popular Eurovision song contest in Belarus. 
The EU-Institutions should now come up with tougher sanctions for the Lukashenko regime, which is quickly 
becoming the North Korea of Eastern Europe. 
 Since the Maastricht Treaty, which also gave the EU competencies a common foreign and security policy in 1992, 
considerably more sanctions have been imposed. According to the list (www.sanctionsmap.eu[1]), more than 170 
punitive measures are currently in force against more than 30 countries. 
 Since December 2020, the EU has had a new mechanism against people worldwide for human rights violations. 
This was first used in March against China - for its repression of the Uyghurs - and other countries. Entry bans and 
account freezes have also been imposed on several people in Russia who were involved in the conviction of 
opposition figure Alexei Navalny. 
 But among diplomats, the theory has been that sanctions only work against smaller states, while large ones like 
China or Russia, the effects on their own economies are usually too great. That is why the trade sanctions that were 
imposed on China, in 1989, following the Tiananmen Square massacres did not last long. 
Sanctions have to hurt
 In the case of Belarus, international organizations like the Council of Europe and OSCE, where Belarus is a 
member, should now demand the release of regime critics and the holding of new elections under supervision. 
Airlines like Turkish Airlines or Aeroflot, both of which continue to fly to Minsk, would have to be banned from 
landing at any airport in Europe. That decision, however, could cause new problems with Ankara and Moscow. 
 The EU imposed sanctions against Russia in several stages after Moscow illegally occupied Crimea and incited a 
separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014. 
 Conversely, the Kremlin reacted by imposing import restrictions on European agricultural products. Because of 
Putin's support for Lukashenko, EU politicians like David Sassoli, the President of the European Parliament, are 
now calling for tougher measures. That said, individual countries such as Hungary and Cyprus could veto them. 
 As a result, the unanimity principle should be dropped in this case. 
 Perhaps the advice of Ukraine's ambassador to Austria, Alexander Scherba, should be followed first. In his new 
book Ukraine vs. Darkness, he suggests that punitive measures against oligarchs who support Putin's system 
should be put in place. 'Let the Russian decision-makers, propagandists, oligarchs and their families spend their 
holidays on Kamchatka or Chukotka, not in their English castles or Italian villas. Cut them off from their wealth by 
blocking them Swift and through visa revocation and freezing their accounts. Poison not only their reputations but 
their money. That's all it takes.

Upbeat Air-Cargo Demand Bodes Well for Airlines: An Analysis

Jun 11, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Even though there has been an uptick in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) in various parts of the world, the 
same lies way below the pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, demand for business travel is still very anemic. This is 
exemplified by the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) April report on air-travel demand. 
Per IATA,[1] total demand for air travel in April 2021 (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) was 
down 65.4% from the April 2019 reading. Even though the scenario pertaining to domestic demand improved in 
April from the March levels, international passenger demand continued to be lackluster with a massive 87.3% 
plunge from the Apr 2019 actuals. 
Given this scenario, passenger revenues, which account for bulk of the top line at most airlines across the globe, 
remain weak and are unlikely to recover to the pre-pandemic levels any time soon. Focus on Cargo Unit: A Saving 
Grace With passenger revenues lagging the 2019 levels, despite the recent improvement, airlines are focusing on 
their cargo units to drive the top line. The coronavirus-induced cancellation of multiple passenger flights aided the 
air-cargo markets to be in the pink of health across the globe as demand in the said space is moving northward. 
Per IATA report[2], global air-cargo demand, measured in cargo tonne-kilometers, was up 12% in April 2021 from 
the April 2019 reading and 7.8% from the March 2021 levels. The strongest performance came from the North 
American carriers. Notably, carriers from that zone contributed 7.5 percentage points to the overall 12% growth 
rate. 
The highly impressive April performance of the North American airlines is basically an extension of their upbeat 
show on this front during the March quarter. Evidently, cargo revenues surged 88.3% year over year to $497 million 
at United Airlines UAL[3] in first-quarter 2021. At American Airlines AAL[4], the same soared in excess of 100% in 
the January-March time frame. Cargo revenues increased 12% at Delta Air Lines DAL[5]. All three carriers currently 
carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Apart from the North American carriers, airlines in other parts of the world except those in Latin America (including 
the likes of Gol Linhas GOL[7] Azul AZUL[8] and Copa Holdings CPA[9]), exhibited higher air-cargo demand for the 
month of April. For example, European carriers, that include Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[10] among others, displayed 
an 11.4% jump in cargo demand during April 2021 from the April 2019 levels. To Wrap Up With passenger 
revenues unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic levels, at least in the near future, we expect airlines to continue 
Upbeat Air-Cargo Demand Bodes Well for Airlines: An Analysis
laying an emphasis on cargo revenues to bump up their top lines. Notably, IATA expects cargo revenues to surge 
to $152 billion in 2021[11] from $128 billion in 2020 and $101 billion in 2019. 
Air-cargo demand should continue to be solid. Precisely, the gradual improvement in global economic conditions 
and supply-chain dynamics could constantly support the uptick in air-cargo demand. +1,500% Growth: One of

 https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/more-international-travel-could-screw-up-end-of-lockdown/The mass reopening of 
international travel could 'screw up' the UK's recovery from coronavirus and must be delayed until other countries 
match Britain's vaccination programme, according to the transport secretary. 
Grant Shapps said that the government had to be 'cautious' over foreign holidays because of the risk of importing 
more cases of the Indian strain of Covid-19. 
 He denied claims that the government was close to placing more countries on the green list[1], which allows 
Britons to travel abroad without quarantining on their return. 
 He said the government was 'having to wait for countries to catch up' with the vaccination programme before the 
list was expanded. In the UK, 75 per cent of adults and about 60 per cent of the population have had one dose of a 
vaccine compared with about 40 per cent of the population of many European countries such as Spain, France, 
Portugal and Greece. 
 'What no one wants to see us doing now is to screw that all up by inadvertently re-attracting the coronavirus . . . 
into this country,' Shapps told Sky News. 
 There has been criticism from airlines and tourism groups over the refusal to expand the 11-strong green list, which 
largely comprises countries that are effectively out of bounds to UK travellers. This week, Portugal was removed 
from the list even though only six out of 100,000 British tourists passing through Faro airport in the Algarve had 
tested positive for the virus. The UK also refused to add Malta to the green list even though it registered zero cases 
for the first time in almost a year this week. 
 Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, described the government's handling of foreign travel as a 'shambles' 
and insisted there was effectively 'no green list'. 
 'This stop, go, stop approach to travel is bonkers,' he told Sky News today . 'Portugal has exactly the same Covid 
case rates and higher vaccination rates when it was taken off the green list than it had when it went on it. Malta has 
higher vaccination rates than the UK. 
 'The whole thing is typical of Boris Johnson's government just making this stuff up as they go along.' 
 Forecasts drawn up by the Airport Operators Association suggested that the next three months could be 'as bad or 
worse than summer 2020' for passenger numbers. 
More international travel could screw up end of lockdown, Grant Shapps warns
 The number of destinations people from the UK could visit last summer without needing to quarantine on their 
return was 'significantly more' than under the present traffic light system, it said. The list is due to be reviewed on 
June 21. 
 The association said that UK airports lost 2.6 billion of revenue between April and September 2020, with a similar 
loss expected this year. 
 Karen Dee, its chief executive, said: 'Unless the government makes a meaningful restart of aviation possible by 
extending the green list at the next review, moving to rapid and affordable tests for returning travellers and following 
the examples of the EU and the US by reducing restrictions on fully vaccinated passengers, aviation is in for an 
extremely difficult summer.' 
 The traffic light system was announced last month, allowing people to travel to green countries without 
quarantining on their return. Up to ten days' isolation and two PCR tests are needed for amber and red countries. 
 Travel industry sources told The Times there were concerns that further changes will be delayed until mid-to-late 
July because of the risk posed to the lifting of domestic lockdown restrictions. There is already a fear that the end of 
restrictions due on June 21 will be delayed by a fortnight because of the spread of the Indian or Delta variant. 
 Speaking from Cornwall, Shapps said: 'I think most people agree that we've got to be cautious. I am the transport 
secretary, I want transport to happen, I want international transport to happen, but I think most people appreciate 
that what we need to do is open up cautiously. 
 'I hope and I am sure that will happen as more and more people are vaccinated around the world. Of course, what 
happened was that the UK got well ahead of the game in terms of more people vaccinated than any other country in 
Europe and so we are just having to wait for countries to catch up.'

Ryanair scores partial win in Condor state aid case

 An EU court has annulled the Commission's decision to approve state aid for German airline Condor. will get to 
hold on to two loans of €550 million, for now.Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday won an EU court case, which 
annulled the European Commission's decision to approve German state aid given to charter airline Condor.  
It is Ryanair's third legal victory contesting against billions of euros in state aid granted to its rivals to support them 
through the coronavirus crisis. 
The General Court of the EU court annulled the Commission's decisions approving two loans of €550 million ($760 
million dollars) to Condor last year. 
Condor payback delayed 
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled. 
But the effects of the annulment — including the order to pay back the aid — are suspended until the Commission 
submits a new decision. 
Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the commission a chance to issue a more 
detailed decision. 
Ryanair welcomes ruling 
The budget airline hailed the court's decision as "an important victory." 
"If Europe is to emerge from this crisis with a functioning single market, the European Commission must stand up to 
national governments and stop rubberstamping discriminatory state aid to inefficient national airlines," Ryanair said 
in a statement. 
Ryanair takes on state aid recipients 
Ryanair has taken the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that its approving a host of state aid 
measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc. 
It won cases related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese TAP in the first instance. But it lost others, such as a 
complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

of 
Britain's biggest airlines may have breached consumer law by failing to offer timely refunds for flights cancelled 
because of the pandemic, the competition watchdog said today. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that British Airways and Ryanair were under investigation 
because they 'refused to give refunds to people that were lawfully unable to fly'. 
 Both airlines may have left passengers 'unfairly out of pocket', it said, with some travellers forced to accept 
vouchers for future flights instead of getting their money back. 
 The regulator could take the carriers to court under the Enterprise Act 2002 to seek refunds or compensation for 
affected customers. 
 The move is made after repeated criticism of airlines for failing to provide money back for flights cancelled as a 
result of travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic over the past 16 months. 
 Under existing rules, airlines are supposed to provide a cash refund if requested within seven days. 
 In some cases, airlines and tour operators have asked customers to accept vouchers or credit notes for future 
bookings, even though there is no indication of when flights and holidays outside the UK will fully resume. 
Passengers who did get their money back often told of lengthy delays or being forced to spend hours on the 
telephone attempting to chase refunds via a call centre. 
 Today's move comes after the watchdog launched enforcement action against several package holiday 
companies, forcing them to agree to offer cash refunds to customers. 
 Last month, Teletext Holidays and Alpharooms agreed to hand back 7 million to customers whose holidays were 
cancelled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 It follows similar agreements made by LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays and TUI UK after thousands 
of customers complained that the companies had failed to refund them for cancelled trips. 
 The travel sector has been one of the hardest hit during the pandemic and has faced the most scrutiny from the 
watchdog, which wrote to more than 100 companies reminding them of their responsibility to process all refunds 
within the legal timeframe. 
 Today, BA hit out at the action, accusing the government of attempting to 'punish further an industry that is on its 
knees'. It said it had issued more than three million refunds. 
British Airways and Ryanair investigated for not offering Covid refunds
 However, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, insisted that airlines had a duty to ensure passengers could book 
tickets with 'confidence'. 
 He told Sky News: 'There is an absolute requirement and duty to make sure that people either rebook or get their 
money back; that is the way to build confidence . . . I do urge all operators to adhere to that and welcome the 
Competition and Market Authority work into this because that's how we are going to rebuild confidence.' 
 The watchdog said it would be writing to both airlines as part of the investigation. 
 It said that during the lockdown 'British Airways and Ryanair refused to give refunds to people that were lawfully 
unable to fly, with British Airways offering vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair providing the option to rebook[1]'. 
Irish-based Ryanair operates an extensive short-haul European network out of UK airports while BA operates short 
and long-haul routes. 
 It added: 'The CMA is concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both companies may have 
breached consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. 
 'It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other 
redress, for affected customers.' 
 Andrea Coscelli, the regulator's chief executive, said: 'While we understand that airlines have had a tough time 
during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. 
 'Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely 
outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back.' 
 The agency said that it should not be assumed either airline has broken the law. 
 A spokeswoman for BA said: 'We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a 
vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. 
 'It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting 
airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. 
 'Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, 
business, connectivity and the UK economy.' 
 Ryanair said it had looked at refunds on a case-by-case basis and had paid money back 'in justified cases'. 
 'Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee 
and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option,' it said in a statement.

A woman was filmed attacking fellow passengers after being called out for not wearing a mask on a flight, the New 
Zealand Herald[3] reported. 
Viral footage shows the woman wearing a facemask on her chin while she verbally assaults passengers. 
As tensions escalate, she can be seen pulling at a woman's hair before spitting at others on board the Ryanair flight 
from Ibiza to Milan Bergamo on May 26.

Later in the clip, crew members try to escort her off the plane. While being held back, she kicks two men. 
"The crew of this flight from Ibiza to Milan Bergamo (26 May) requested police assistance upon arrival after a 
passenger became disruptive in-flight," a Ryanair spokesperson told Insider. 
"The aircraft landed normally, and police removed the individual at Milan Bergamo airport. This is now a matter for 
local police," the spokesperson added. 
Unruly passengers[6] are a growing problem for airlines, Insider's Allana Akhtar[7] reported. 
The Federal Aviation Administration, an American civil aviation agency, said it had received 2,500 reports of 
disorderly behavior by passengers since January 2021. About 1,900 of the reports deal with passengers who 
refused to comply with the federal facemask mandate. 
In April, Southwest Airlines passengers danced and cheered[8] as a couple accused of refusing to wear masks 
were thrown off a flight. 
In late May, a Southwest Airlines passenger punched a flight attendant in the face[9] after repeatedly ignoring in-

 US President Joe Biden has pledged solidarity with allies against the Kremlin's "challenges to European security." 
"Putin knows that I won't hesitate to respond to future harmful activities," Biden said.The US will stand with 
European allies against Russia, President Joe Biden said ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir 
Putin. 
"We are standing united to address Russia's challenges to European security, starting with its aggression in 
Ukraine," Biden wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post published on Saturday. 
Biden said he has been "clear and direct" in previous phone calls with Putin. 
"The United States does not seek conflict. We want a stable and predictable relationship where we can work with 
Russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control," he wrote. However, he added: "Putin knows that I will not 
hesitate to respond to future harmful activities." 
Biden is scheduled to head to Europe on Wednesday for both the G7 and NATO summits. He is then expected to 
meet Putin face-to-face in Geneva on June 16. 
Biden on China and Russia 
Biden said his trip to Europe "is about realizing America's renewed commitment" to allies and to "deter the threats 
of this new age." 
He added that the US "must lead the world from a position of strength," whether it is ending the COVID-19 
pandemic worldwide or addressing climate change. 
But the US president notably used the op-ed to highlight what he called "challenges" imposed by China and Russia. 
Biden said Washington would play a global role in "confronting the harmful activities of the governments of China 
and Russia." 
"We will focus on ensuring that market democracies, not China or anyone else, write the 21st-century rules around 
trade and technology," he said, adding that world democracies should work together to expose and counter 
"ransomware attacks," "cyberattacks" and "invasive AI-driven surveillance." 
Biden leaves out Belarus 
Since assuming office in January, Biden has ramped up pressure on Russia, slamming the Kremlin for repeated 
human rights abuses. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday warned Russia and Belarus against threatening the alliance, 
following the forced landing of a Ryanair commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius in Minsk.

The former Soviet republic has escalated repression against independent journalists and peaceful protesters in the 
past five months. 
However, Biden did not comment on Belarus in the op-ed.

 Roman Protasevich made preparations to protect his digital security before he was detained last month. But a 
friend said the young dissident did not predict that the Lukashenko regime would take such a drastic step. Franak 
Viačorka, a colleague of Protasevich, told Insider that his friend's "nightmare" was being captured by the KGB. See 
more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Weeks before Belarusian authorities diverted a passenger plane[2] to Minsk in order to arrest 26-year-old dissident 
Roman Protasevich[3], the young opposition blogger had discussed with a colleague the possibility that Belarus's 
authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko[4], might make a targeted strike against him. 
In the aftermath of Protasevich's arrest, Franak Viačorka, a senior advisor to exiled Belarusian opposition leader 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and a longtime colleague of Protasevich, told Insider that the two men had discussed 
potential scenarios and reactions to different events undertaken by their country's autocratic government. 
"We thought about security a lot," Viačorka said. "Especially digital security."  
As co-founder and editor-in-chief of NEXTA, a popular opposition Telegram channel based in Poland, Protasevich 
focused much of his work on leaking videos and documents from the Lukashenko regime. The team at NEXTA 
played a vital informational role during last year's highly contested presidential election[5] as Lukashenko's regime 
shuttered independent media organizations inside the country.  
When Belarusian security forces detained Protasevich on May 23 after the Ryanair flight he was traveling on from 
Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Minsk, Viačorka said all of Protasevich's pages and accounts were 
deleted, thanks to prior digital security planning.  
"But we neglected the physical security," he said. "This flight, this was something we did not predict.  
Protasevich had been flying to Vilnius from Athens where he had been covering an economic forum before enjoying 
a brief vacation with his girlfriend, 23-year-old Sofia Sapega[6], who was also detained last month.  
Viačorka had been in Greece with Protasevich just days before, where he and his boss, Tikhanovskaya, who was 
forced into exile after running against Lukashenko in August's disputed elections, attended the same conference, at 
the invitation of Greece's government, he said.  
Colleague of detained Belarusian dissident said he and Roman Protasevich talked about digital security 
preparations prior to arrest but 'neglected' physical sec....
In fact, one week before Protasevich and Sapega's fateful Ryanair flight, Viačorka told Insider that he and 
Tikhanovskaya took the same flight from Athens to Vilnius.  
"So, perhaps, that was also a message to us," he said.  
When Viačorka saw the news that a plane had been forced to stop in Minsk on that Sunday in May, he said he was 
shocked. He believes he was one of the first people to know Protasevich was on the flight and the intended target 
of the aircraft's backtracking.  
"I waited until the very last moment to not publish this information, hoping that something will change, hoping that 
they will let him go or they will not land in Minsk," he said. 
In the hours and days that followed the abrupt diversion, passengers on the flight told reporters that Protasevich 
looked "shocked" and "scared"[7] following the pilot's announcement, even as the young activist instinctively began 
collecting his electronics to hand over to Sapega for safekeeping.  
Ryanair's CEO later said KGB agents[8] had been aboard the flight from the start. 
"I know Roman was scared. He was always afraid of being captured by KGB," Viačorka said. "It was his nightmare." 
In their conversations in the weeks leading up to Protasevich's capture, the two men discussed KGB methods and 
spy networks, Viačorka said.  
"Sometimes joking, sometimes seriously, we discussed these different situations," he said. "Perhaps, this is the only 
situation we did not predict." 
Protasevich now faces a possible death sentence[9] on charges of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots in 
Belarus - the last European country to employ the method.  
On Thursday, he appeared[10] on Belarusian state TV confessing to crimes against the country and praising his 
one-time foe, Lukashenko. Protasaevich's family, Belarusian opposition leaders, and members of the international 
community have decried the video, which has raised new concerns of torture and coercion. Read the original article

 Belarusian authorities last month diverted a passenger flight in order to arrest a 26-year-old activist. The move 
shocked the international community, but experts said the step "falls within a certain pattern" for President 
Alexander Lukashenko. As the autocrat doubles down[1] in the aftermath, experts say international attention and 
action are more important than ever. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. 
The state-sanctioned diversion and detainment[3] of Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich[4] last 
month sparked outrage and reproach around the globe. But experts say the drastic move is emblematic of a larger, 
more nefarious problem in Eastern Europe: the ongoing corruption and abuses by Belarus's authoritarian president 
Alexander Lukashenko.[5]  
Often dubbed "Europe's last dictator," Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, enacting his autocratic rule for 
nearly as long. 
But in 2020, Belarus bore witness to a forceful wave of repression following a highly-contested August election, 
which prompted widespread protests throughout the country.  
Protasevich's detainment in May, though undeniably shocking, "falls within a certain pattern" for Lukashenko, who 
continues to pursue[6] a renewed crackdown against any and all critics, according to Rachel Denber, Deputy 
Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. 
In the days since the hijacking, Lukashenko has doubled down - issuing a travel ban[7] for most residents and 
releasing a suspect video[8] of a detained Protasevich praising the leader and confessing to crimes. 
Now, with all eyes on Belarus, experts say international action is more imperative than ever. A state-sanctioned 
hijacking captivates the globe On May 23, Belarusian authorities sent a fighter jet to divert a Ryanair plane flying 
from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, citing a bogus bomb threat. The passenger plane backtracked, landing 
in Minsk, where police officers boarded the jet and arrested Protasevich, a 26-year-old journalist and activist, and 
his girlfriend Sofia Sapega[9], a 23-year-old Russian student.  
The 'shocking' arrest of a Belarusian dissident sparked international condemnation, but it falls into a 'pattern' of 
ongoing authoritarianism from Alexander Luk....
Passengers on Ryanair Flight 4978 told media outlets that the plane was "just minutes" from its destination in 
Lithuania when the pilot announced the aircraft would make an emergency landing in the Belarusian capital, after 
previously flying through the country's airspace.  
In the aftermath of the abrupt diversion, passengers on the flight told reporters that Protasevich looked "shocked" 
and "scared"[10] following the pilot's announcement, even as the young activist instinctively began collecting his 
electronics to hand over to Sapega for safekeeping.  
Ryanair's CEO later said KGB agents[11] had been aboard the flight from the start.  
Franak Viačorka, a senior advisor to exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and a longtime 
colleague of Protasevich, told Insider he knows his friend was scared.  
"He was always afraid of being captured by KGB, it was his nightmare," Viačorka said. 
The two men were together just before Protasevich's detainment, attending an economic conference in Greece, 
where Protasevich and Sapega also enjoyed a brief vacation. Weeks earlier, Viačorka said he and Protasevich had 
discussed the possibility of his capture and made plans for digital and electronic security. 
"But we neglected physical security," Viačorka said. "This was something we did not predict." An 'excessively 
paranoid' leader casts aside legality to apprehend a longtime adversary Belarusian state media[12] has reported 
that it was Lukashenko, himself, who gave the "unequivocal order" to ground the plane in Minsk - an audacious act 
by a powerful man driven by the notion that his enemies are out to get him, according to Denber. 
"I think it shows that he wanted to send a message that 'we will find you no matter where you are,'" Denber said. 
"No one is safe."  
Viačorka likened Lukashenko's brazen display of power to an "alpha man" wanting to prove to the world he is in 
control. 
Lukashenko's moves in the days since seem to confirm Viačorka's characterization of the aging autocrat. On May 
24, Belarusian authorities posted videos of both Protasevich[13] and Sapega[14] confessing to crimes against the 
country.  
Opposition leaders and Protasevich's own father said the videos were made under duress[15], and what appeared 
to be an injury on Protasevich's face sparked concerns of torture. 
Then, on Thursday, the young dissident appeared[16] on Belarusian state TV confessing to organizing "mass 
unrest" and praising his one-time foe. 
"I realized that many things [Lukashenko] is criticized for are just attempts to pressure him, and that in many 
moments he acted like...a man with balls of steel," Protasevich says in the video. 
Ten days after his arrest, the staunch Lukashenko opponent was suddenly praising the autocrat's regime. 
Protasevich, who began his activism at 16, had been detained several times before during his time freelancing for 
opposition news outlets before moving to Poland after he was forces out of university. As co-founder and editor-in-
chief of NEXTA, an opposition Telegram channel, he focused much of his work on leaking videos and documents 
from the Lukashenko regime.  
In 2019, he was drawn back to Belarus, eager to impact real change in Minsk. But Lukashenko's authoritarian grasp 
was tightening on the country ahead of the 2020 elections, and anticipating impending danger, Protasevich fled to 
Warsaw for a second time. 
Protasevich and his allies continued their journalism at NEXTA leading up to the presidential election, playing a vital 
informational role as Lukashenko's regime shuttered independent media organizations inside the country.  
But amid mass protests following the country's highly contested 2020 election, Protasevich's journalism evolved into 
political activism as he began organizing protests against the Belarusian government through NEXTA, which had 
become the most popular opposition platform in Belarus.  
"We're journalists, but we also have to do something else," Protasevich told The New York Times[17] in September. 
"No one else is left. The opposition leaders are in prison." Belarus has suffered years of election-cycle repression 
under Lukashenko's regime For nearly three decades, Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with a tight grip reminiscent of 
the country's Soviet past. But he wasn't always an oppositional figure. 
"It's important to remember that [Lukashenko] was quite popular when he was elected in 1994," Denber said. 
In the aftermath of the Soviet Union's fall, economic despair and widespread corruption reigned throughout the 
region, casting a tremendous uncertainty over Belarus. Lukashenko offered an appealing message and solution, 
Denber said. He wanted to stabilize the economy, fight corruption, and provide economic and national stability for 
the people. 
The 'shocking' arrest of a Belarusian dissident sparked international condemnation, but it falls into a 'pattern' of 
ongoing authoritarianism from Alexander Luk....
"But his autocratic...intent to erode democratic freedom and to very brusquely cast aside human rights emerged 
very quickly," Denber said.  
By 1996, Lukashenko had already introduced constitutional reforms that strengthened his presidency to the 
detriment of other government branches and had begun going after his political opponents. By the end of the '90s, 
Denber said several of Lukashenko's political adversaries had disappeared, some presumed murdered.  
Thus began a decades-long cycle of election-era repressions targeting independent journalists, human rights 
defenders, and political protesters. Several election cycles in the aughts sparked protests, Denber said, which in 
turn, would lead to fierce government crackdowns against civil society.  
"There were a lot of pretty dark years," she said.  
After a particularly grim period from 2010 to 2012, Lukashenko's repression eventually gave way to a slight 
"loosening up," Denber said. By 2019, Belarus had released almost all of its political prisoners, and the European 
Union and the United States both dropped formerly-imposed sanctions against the country. 
As the 2020 elections approached, Denber said the government promised a commitment to free and fair elections - 
it was the first time in years an opposition candidate would be allowed to run a real campaign.  
But the August elections proved to be an inflection point of massive consequence for Protasevich, Lukashenko, and 
the future of Belarus. A 'highly contested' election and a 'catastrophic' crackdown As campaigning for the landmark 
election began, it was clear Lukashenko was far from ready to acquiesce power. Leading opposition candidates 
found themselves arrested, oftentimes on bogus charges, while other candidates were simply refused the 
opportunity to register. 
Sergei Tikhanovsky, a well-known blogger faced both a refusal to register his nomination and a short prison 
sentence for organizing unauthorized protests. So, his wife Svetlana Tikhanovskaya decided to run in his place.  
"She was able to campaign fairly unimpeded," Denber said. "Nobody expected she would draw the crowd she 
drew." 
Her popularity grew among Belarusians in the spring and early summer. In June, Tikhanovskaya received an 
anonymous phone call threatening her children's life unless she dropped out. She sent her children out of Belarus 
but stayed in the race.  
On August 9, the Central Election Commission, which is controlled by Lukashenko's government, announced that 
the incumbent president had won a sixth term, crediting him with 80% of the vote. Tikhanovskaya's team objected, 
claiming to have won at least 60% in a first-round victory and calling on Lukashenko to begin negotiations. 
"It's hard to know what percentage of the vote she actually got, but clearly more than anyone expected," Denber 
said. 
Negotiations never came. Instead, the government arrested two members of her campaign's Coordination Council 
and offered the others a false choice: Leave the country or else.  
"We are dealing with a man who is getting...politically older," Viačorka, Tikhanovskaya's senior advisor said about 
Lukashenko. "Last year he became anxious, nervous, and absolutely irrational." 
During the height of the election outcry in September, Protasevich left Poland to join Tikhanovskaya in Lithuania, 
cementing himself even further as Lukashenko's enemy.  
In Belarus, the disputed election set off a mass wave of unprecedented, mostly peaceful protests. Viačorka 
estimated the movement was one of the biggest progressive movements in Europe in the past 40 years.  
But the civil demonstrations drew Lukashenko's ire. The government dismantled what independent media was left, 
targeting and arresting journalists throughout the country; officials restricted internet access for hours in August as 
protests surged; and security forces detained thousands of people, subjecting hundreds to torture, Human Rights 
Watch[18] reported at the end of 2020.  
"There are so many people in prison right now," Denber said in May. "Literally hundreds in jail connected to the 
protest movement."  
Viačorka believes thousands are still detained. Experts hope last month's aviation incident will spur international 
attention and action Lukashenko's post-elections crackdown stoked anger among ordinary Belarusians, making him 
even more unpopular throughout the country and prompting dissidents to look for new forms of resistance, Viačorka 
said. 
But it was last month's incident - Protasevich and Sapega's detainment - that captured the world's attention.  
"Last year's oppression was eye-opening for Belarusians...that was a wake-up call for Belarusians," Viačorka said. 
"Sunday was a wake-up call for the world." 
The 'shocking' arrest of a Belarusian dissident sparked international condemnation, but it falls into a 'pattern' of 
ongoing authoritarianism from Alexander Luk....
Denber agreed, saying she hoped the hijacking would "shock people to read into what else is happening" in the 
European country, including the death of a dissident in prison[19] and the arrest of additional journalists[20] since 
Protasevich's arrest. 
The US responded to what some countries called a "state-sanctioned hijacking"[21] with fierce statements of 
condemnation and a re-imposition of full-blocking sanctions[22] against Belarusian enterprises and a handful of key 
members in the regime. The EU prepared its own package of sanctions[23] targeting the country's national airline 
and top aviation officials, as well as the Belarusian economy. 
All 27 members of the EU also agreed to bar[24] European airlines from flying through Belarusian airspace and 
block Belarus's national airline from flying through or landing in the EU.  
But the EU may be in a bind moving forward. As the West moves to isolate Belarus even further, the closer it 
pushes Lukashenko to Vladimir Putin, his complicated, on-again-off-again Russian ally[25]. 
Many top officials believe it was Putin who gave Belarus the green light to divert the Ryanair flight.[26] 
But Tikhanovskaya and Viačorka are pressing international allies to think beyond last month's incident. On 
Tuesday, the opposition leader called for more US sanctions[27], imploring the country to take further action against 
enterprises and individuals supporting the Lukashenko regime. 
"Sanctions should help to stop the violence and help release all of political prisoners," she said after meeting with 
senators from the US Foreign Relations Committee. 
Viačorka and the opposition who remain free will continue to put pressure on the regime, fighting for new, free 
elections and democratic reforms, he said. He's also compelling Western politicians to help. 
"I urge Americans and Europeans, be braver, be strong," he told Insider. "The regime is the problem and if you 
don't want North Korea in the the center of Europe, try to do everything to shut it down, please." 
As for Protasevich, his future remains uncertain. Last week, his mother begged[28] the US and EU to help free her 
son, who faces charges of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots.  
On Wednesday, Lukashenko intimated[29] that Protasevich may face the death penalty for his "crimes" in Belarus - 
the last country in Europe to employ the practice.  
But Viačorka knows that his friend is only one prisoner in an ongoing war. 
"It's not about Roman. We don't want to trade for Roman only," he said. "He will be released only when all prisoners 
will be released." Read the original article on Business Insider[30]

Jun 04, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian state TV aired an interview in which Roman Protasevich praised President Lukashenko. Protasevich's 
father said this showed Belarus had "broken" his son and forced his actions. Dmitry Protasevich said: "I know my 
son very well and I believe that he would never say such things." See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The father of Roman Protasevich, the Belarusian dissident who was detained after authorities diverted his flight, 
has said that the country had "broken" his son by forcing him to confess and praise its authoritarian president[2] on 
video. 
The Belarusian state TV channel ONT published a 90-minute-long interview on Thursday, which showed 
Protasevich appearing to praise President Alexander Lukashenko, whom Protasevich had long criticized. -Matthew 
Luxmoore (@mjluxmoore) June 3, 2021[3] "I realized that many things Aleksandr Grigoryevich [Lukashenko] is 
criticised for are just attempts to pressure him, and that in many moments he acted like a man with balls of steel," 
Protasevich said, according to Matthew Luxmoore, RFERL's Moscow correspondent. 
Protasevich went on to say that he regretted on calling on Belarusians to organize against the government and 
distanced himself from the country's opposition leader. 
In a Thursday interview with Agence France-Presse[4] after the state TV interview was aired, Protasevich's father 
Dmitry said: "I know my son very well and I believe that he would never say such things." 
"They broke him and forced him to say what was needed," he said. 
Protasevich is a co-founder of the NEXTA Telegram channel, the most popular opposition platform in Belarus. 
Roman Protasevich was seized by Belarusian authorities on May 23 after the country diverted his Lithuania-bound 
Ryanair flight. The dissident had been living in Poland in 2019 over fears for his security. 
Dmitry Protasevich said[5] last month that he believed Roman was being forced to admit guilt in an earlier video 
Belarusian authorities released of him, and that Roman appeared to be beaten up. Read the original article on

Jun 03, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 A diverted plane is nothing new, bomb threats may be rare but are no longer a novelty, but an armed interceptor 
fighter jet 'escorting' an airliner to an unexpected destination in another country is very different. Now step forward, 
or rather, fly forward, to Ryanair flight 4978, which was traveling from Athens to Vilnius on May 23, when it was 
forced to land in Belarus. 
 First, can we put the fallacy of a potential bomb threat to one side? This was a politically motivated act and 
intended to capture an irritant to the Belarusian regime. After all, state security police do not suddenly turn up just to 
'escort' an individual off a plane. 
 What we should do is put this issue in perspective in regards to what is changing around our continent, especially 
involving politics but also the greater economy of the region as well as that of individual nations. 
 Globally, authoritarianism seems to have been successful in terms of wielding power, and the acquiescence of the 
populations affected has for the most part been remarkable. One notable and worthy exception to this has been the 
continued presence of demonstrators in Minsk and key areas of Belarus, who have stood up very bravely against 
well-armed police and the Belarusian KGB. 
 Obviously, the power of the Russian leader has had a significant influence, where the sham of democracy has 
increasingly been exposed. The paranoia that Russian leaders have had over the centuries about foreign 
interference is still well-entrenched in the country's political class and intelligence services. This is to a certain 
extent understandable given the historical track record of foreign invasion and interference in Russia, from the 
Mongol-Tatars to the Poles, to Napoleon and post-October Revolution military interventions, and of course World 
War II. The Russians quite rightly highlight their pain, efforts and losses to the outside world. 
 Today we see Russia taking advantage of a hopelessly weak and vacillating European leadership to extend its 
influence, not just in Europe, but on a more international scale, especially in the Middle East. 
A Russian Topol-M strategic nuclear missile on Moscow's Red Square. EPA-EFE/SERGEI CHIRIKOV 
Now let's add in Ukraine, in a chronic state, both politically and economically, where Putin has again called 
Europe's bluff over the theft of the Crimea and the support for the separatists in two eastern Ukrainian regions. 
Their calls for support have achieved little and any action has been either by indirect support, denunciations or 
marginal sanctions. They merely provide Vladimir Putin with an opportunity for a wry smile. 
European weakness and the rise of authoritarians
 Now with the arrival of the energy pipeline Nord Stream-2, Russia plays another card by providing direct fuel to 
Germany alongside unreliable statements about operational independence. Please wake up Chancellor Merkel: 
there is a large bear sitting on your gas tap. This is a tap that can be turned off at a time of tension and there have 
been clear precedents in the past. Germany has been blessed with possibly the strongest and most successful 
democratic leader it could have in the form of Angela Merkel, but as her extended term in office draws to a close, 
there seems no one of similar stature to take her place. 
 Then we have another EU power and that is France. Marine Le Pen seems to have rebuilt her position and power 
to such an extent that another democratic assault on the Elysee is almost certainly on the cards. Again this is not 
necessarily because this fervent right-winger is particularly able, but because democratic leaders are seen as being 
weak and ineffectual.  
 A similar story can be told both in Poland and Hungary where phrases along the lines of 'I didn't swap domination 
by Moscow and the old Soviet Communist Party to be controlled and dictated to by Brussels bureaucrats' are not 
unknown. 
 Another element to this tawdry tale was Brexit, opted for by just over half of the UK voting population. This too was 
a vote won by the populists and has, as was fairly predictable, created some difficult disturbances on both sides of 
the Channel. For the EU there is obviously a significant disruption in its budget, with one of the largest contributors 
pulling out, but also despite the frequent arguments, a reduction in political strength with such a powerful nation 
leaving. 
 Equally, though, for the British, there is the slow realization that the national economy will be poorer at least in the 
short term. Trading issues through delays, new systems and bureaucracy have already had a negative impact (both 
in ports such as Dover, but more importantly across the Irish border) and now the shortage of labor is being felt 
directly from farm produce not being harvested swiftly enough, through to the hospitality industry.  
 This was obviously severely affected by the economic lockdowns and the furlough schemes, so as yet we cannot 
judge just how many people will be returning to those jobs, but the strong indication is that a significant reduction in 
the workforce from mainland European countries is having quite a dramatic effect on cafes and restaurants which 
are fully opening up. 
 By casting our eyes over Europe, we can see the broader effect that these political changes are having. The main 
issue in my view is that of confidence, as that is the key driver for investment and expansion. The seeming 
destabilization over the past few years caused by authoritarians over vacillating democracies will have an effect. 
Europe needs to have a clear post-pandemic plan to re-energize its economies both inside and outside the 
European Union. 
 This means some clear and effective leadership from the democracies, which at present seems hard to find. 
Democracy is a precious commodity that is hard to win. It can easily be lost whether through indifference or just 
pompous complacency. Europe has created astonishing wealth for itself after the disasters of the two 20th-century 
world wars and the decades of Communist rule in the continent's eastern half, but this economic strength must not 
be dissipated by political ignorance or, dare I say it, stupidity. 
 I believe we have a great opportunity for some very exciting development, but it is going to take some great 
political vision, leadership and action to push back the nay-sayers and enthuse our populations for a brighter and 
stronger economic future.

 Have European Union restrictions on travelers from the U.S., Britain and some other major nations become 
politicized? The chief executive of Wizz Air, the Budapest-based low-cost airline, thinks so. 
'I think the European Union as such has broken down completely," József Vradi told CNBC this week. "We have 
failed to come up with unified measures and an orchestrated approach dealing with the situation, and it has become 
incredibly overpoliticized.' 
He's not alone in expressing frustration. Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, a rival Dublin-headquartered 
discount airline, has urged politicians to recognize 'it's time that we got on with our lives.' Ryanair last month posted 
the biggest annual loss in the company's 35-year history, because of COVID-19 travel restrictions and lockdowns 
wiping out air traffic. This turned the company's previous year's $1.24 billion profit into a $990 million loss in the 12 
months to March 31. 
The EU decision Thursday to urge member states to maintain a prohibition on tourists and other nonessential 
travelers from the U.S. and Britain, among other non-EU countries, has left many in Europe's commercial aviation 
and hospitality sectors fuming about what they view as the laggardly pace of easing travel restrictions for tourists.

06/AP21153430493530.jpg?itok=gz3gZ6NH European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas speaks 
during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels, June 2, 2021. The European Union unveiled 
Wednesday plans to revamp Europe's ID-check free travel area. Lack of uniformity 
They say the European Commission is being overcautious, and they also are impatient with the lack of uniformity 
among member states about reopening their countries to tourists this Northern Hemisphere summer. Most national 
governments have been implementing the EC's tight travel recommendations, but others in the past few weeks 
have not, further complicating journeys into the bloc from outside, especially for those unable to take direct flights to 
their destinations. 
Frustration Greets EU Decision to Keep Travel Restrictions on US, UK
Some member states have also been imposing curbs on travel from other EU countries, turning the bloc and the 
once borderless Schengen Area into a complicated puzzle of rules and requirements. 
Italy, Portugal and Greece, member states of the Schengen Area, and Croatia, an EU member, have all been 
ignoring Brussels and have been cautiously opening their tourist-dependent countries to travelers, including from 
the U.S. and Britain, which have vaccinated more of their populations than the EU. Italy started to ease travel 
restrictions on Americans and Britons in mid-May, although quarantines often still apply. Americans can travel on 
COVID-19-safe flights to Italy, which require multiple coronavirus tests. 
American and British travelers are crucial for the European tourist industry. Americans made more than 36 million 
trips to Europe in 2019. The total number of tourist visits by U.K. residents to the European Union reached 67 
million the same year. 
EC keeps a list 
The EC has a 'white list' of countries with low infection rates comprising Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, 
Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Travelers from those countries, regardless of their reasons for journeys, are 
welcome, as far as the EC is concerned. Japan was added to the list at midweek. China also is on the white list, 
subject to reciprocity by the Chinese government. 
The 27 EU member states have been debating for months ways to make travel easier, both within the bloc and from 
outside, and the EC has recommended all member states starting July 1 lift restrictions on travelers who were fully 
vaccinated at least 14 days before their arrival in the EU.

06/AP21119359269403.jpg?itok=9u2M7TA6 FILE - German police check arriving passengers for a negative 
coronavirus test in Frankfurt, March 30, 2021. The European Commission proposed April 29 issuing 'Digital Green 
Certificates' to EU residents to facilitate travel in the bloc by summer. By July 1, the EU's Digital COVID-19 
certificate is meant to be up and running across the bloc, allowing border authorities to verify the coronavirus status 
of travelers — whether they have been vaccinated, had a recent negative test or have proof of recovery from 
coronavirus infection. Seven countries, including tourist-dependent Greece and Croatia, already have started rolling 
out so-called vaccine passports much earlier than planned. 
'Europeans should enjoy a safe and relaxing summer," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said 
Monday. "As vaccination progresses, we propose to gradually ease travel measures in a coordinated way with our 
common tool: the EU Digital COVID Certificate.' 
But some in Europe's travel industry have doubts that everything will go smoothly next month, even when many 
restrictions are due to be eased. Olivier Jankovec, director-general of Airports Council International Europe, a trade 
association, worries there will be a lack of consistency in travel rules across the bloc and says the EC and national 
governments don't understand how challenging reopening will be for airports and airlines. Jankovec says the EU 
and member states are underestimating what will happen when tourism does pick up. 
Airport 'chaos' feared 
'The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind-blowing for now," Jankovec said 
in a statement. "With each passing day, the prospect of travelers enduring widespread chaos at airports this 
summer is becoming more real. We urgently need governments to step up planning on the full range of issues 
involved — and work more closely with airports and airlines.'

06/AP21119359310073.jpg?itok=PFYUxiwi FILE - Travelers, wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the 
coronavirus, walk along the departure hall of the Zaventem international airport in Brussels, Jan. 22, 2021. His trade 
association has warned that air passengers risk spending hours at airports in July and August because of multiple 
and diverse COVID-19 checks. 
Some British lawmakers have expressed suspicions the EU has not added Britain to the white list because of post-
Brexit political grievances. Last month, Brussels eased its COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people criteria from 25 to 
75 and Britain meets the EU target. But EU officials say they are concerned about an increase in infections in 
Britain from a more transmissible coronavirus variant first discovered in India, hence the decision to exclude the 
U.K. 
The Biden administration has not yet lifted a ban on travelers wishing to visit the United States from the 27 
European Union member states and the United Kingdom, but officials have indicated that could soon change. 
Meanwhile, Britain also has faced criticism from southern European countries for failing to include them on its 
meager 'green list' of safe-for-travel countries. Portugal's foreign ministry said it couldn't 'understand the logic' of 
Britain's midweek switch of Portugal from green to amber. 
The move means any Britons who travel to Portugal will have to take two tests upon their return and self-isolate at 
home for 10 days, which will deter tourists. 'Portugal is continuing its easing of its lockdown, prudently and 
gradually, with clear rules for the safety of those who reside here or visit us,' Portugal's foreign ministry tweeted 
Thursday. 
British officials, like their EU counterparts, say they are guided in their decision by the scientific advice they are 
receiving. The U.S. has not lifted its restrictions on travel from Europe for non-U.S. citizens or residents, but officials 
in Washington have told VOA that is under review.

government Telegram channel[4].Thevideos attack the opposition[5]and praise the regime, which violates human 
rights.Boosting the videos would cost tens of thousands of euros, on top of production costs.The videos used as 
advertising go againstYouTube standards[6]on ads. 
 It all started with an alarming tweet.Tadeusz Giczan[7], the editor-in-Chief of Belarus's largest Telegram channel 
NEXTA_TV, wrote that confession videos of people captured by the Belarusian state are used as paid ads on 
YouTube to advertise pro-government Telegram channels. 
The man on the video screenshot isRaman Pratasevich[8]after being arrested on 23 May 2021, following theforced 
diversion of a RyanAir flight[9]from Athens to Vilnius to Minsk airport. 
Pratasevich has worked as a photographer and journalist and currently is the editor-in-chief of the opposition 
Telegram channels 'Nexta[10]' and 'Nexta Live[11]'. After the rigged presidential election in 2020, these channels 
collected and published videos of mass protests, making the content accessible across the whole world. Now 
The Dirty Side Of Advertising: Forced Confessions From Belarus On Youtube
Pratasevich'sforced confession[12], titled 'The terrorist confessed everything',seems to be used[13]to advertise pro-
government Telegram channelYellow plums[14](@zheltyeslivy). 
It's also important to bear in mind that this isnot the first time[15]such forced confession videos have been released. 
The channel 
The channel spreading the videos is called Беларусь - страна для жизни or 'Belarus - the country for life'. It is 
worth noting that the official promotionalvideo[16]of Belarus (also visibleon YouTube[17]) from 2015 bears the same 
name. 
Another link to the Belarusian regime is apparent in the channel'schoice of logo[18], as it resembles theBelarusian 
presidential flag[19]. 
The channel's'About' section does not reveal[20]who is behind it. The only publicly available information shows that 
it has 1390 subscribers, and the view count exceeds a whopping 6 million. 
Last, but not least, the channel was created on 5 August 2020. On the very same day, a video was uploaded, 
showing illegitimate president Alyaksandr Lukashenka delivering a speech. After the presidential elections on 9 
August, the videos showed violentprotesters[21]with a question: 'Is this peaceful?'. Another clipbashed the 
opposition[22]. 
The spread 
To see how manypeople noticed[23]this promoted campaign, we ran a Googlesearch[24]using the Channel ID 
code. We found thatthe videos uploaded[25]by the channel and thenpromoted as advertisements[26], were shared 
in multiple Telegram channels. We alsofound a post[27]describing how previously users saw advertisements of 
shampoo and English courses, but afterwards were targeted with pro-government video clips. The user also 
wondered why YouTube's moderators allowed such ads to run. 
We also found a Telegrammessage[28]with a screenshot of theforced confession video[29]of Raman Pratasevich's 
partner, Sofia Sapegaused as an advert[30]. The video is covered with a Russian language watermark saying 
Yellow Plums, the advertisement has a hyperlink to theYellow Plums Telegram[31]channel and the very same 
channel had also published the same confession video. 
The comments below the screenshot discuss how propagandists use the state budget for such advertisements and 
draw some historic parallels. 
The cost and videos 
As there is no publicly available information on who the ads targeted, we tried to find out how much it would cost the 
channel to run such ads if they only focused on an audience in Belarus. Thus, we mimicked the process of creating 
a YouTube advertisement to obtain the suggested cost per view (CPV). We found that a view in Belarus costs 0.01 
euro. 
As for what counts as a view, Google Ads defines it as a user interacting with the ad, watching it entirely or for at 
least 30 seconds. It's important to bear in mind that YouTube does not publicly share information about how many 
of the views were a result of paid promotion. 
The Dirty Side Of Advertising: Forced Confessions From Belarus On Youtube
The videos 
According to the information above and the publicly visible 139,000 views on the Raman Pratasevich'svideo[32], the 
promotion cost should be at least 1390 euros. But that's only the minimum sum. As stated above, YouTube only 
counts a view if a user watches the video for at least 30 seconds but charges the channel owner 0.01 euros every 
time a user saw at least 4 seconds of the clip. 
As for the entire channel, by June 2, it had 55 videos. The most popular video features rapper Seryoga who claims 
there isabsolute peace and order in Belarus[33]and that the infrastructure is working. The clip has 672,000 views, 4 
shares and 12 likes on Facebook and according to media analysis tool BuzzSumo it is an advertisement. 
The channel also has multiple videos about Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. One of them is 
a12 second compilation[34]of different clips that make her say 'Spring is close and we know that those guilty for 
violence against Belarusians Me, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, my team, my representatives will go to jail and it's not 
an exaggeration.' The description of the video is simple: 'Это конец Света' or 'This is the end, Sveta'. The video 
has 196,000 views. 
On the other side of the spectrum, we can find a two minute video showingillegitimate Belarusian 
president[35]Alyaksandr Lukashenka giving a speech, protesters harassing the police and some smiling babies. 
The video description says it'spowerful, bright in emotions and constructive[36]and it has 171,000 views. 
The numbers 
The total view count of the channel is 6,279,000. If this is divided between all the 55 videos uploaded, the result is a 
whopping 114,164 views on average. 
When the same approach is applied to the YouTube channel of theBelarusian Information Agency BelTA[37], the 
result is, on average, 7,909 views per video. 
Moreover, a YouTube channel with only 1390 subscribers should normally receive fewer than 1000 views on non-
promoted content (point proven byeight videos with less than 1000 views[38]). The numbers above and below show 
that the content was either viral or there were more videos used as adverts. The latter would mean that someone is 
paying YouTube tens of thousands of euros to attack the critics of the Belarusian regime, advertise a pro-
government Telegram channel, show that everything is in order in Belarus and that the president is a trustworthy 
person. 
Out of the 55 videos uploaded by the channel, BuzzSumo was able to gather information about 14. While it labelled 
only two of them as advertisements, some of the others (namely theforced confession[39]of Pratasevich) fell very 
close to the threshold BuzzSumo uses to detect an advert. Note that while Sofia Sapega's video has 193,600 
views, it has no shares, likes or comments on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit or Pinterest. 
The Telegram and YouTube channels 
Returning to the Tweet ofTadeusz Giczan[40]and the question of what kind of role theBelarusian Information 
Agency BelTA[41]plays in using Raman Pratasevich's video topromote pro-government[42]Telegram[43]channel 
Yellow Plums, we can only rely on netizensdiscussing[44]the matter and sharing screenshots of ads with hyperlinks 
to the channel visible. 
Thus, on the surface, theYellow Plums Telegram[45]channel is not linked to BelTA. However, the channel regularly 
posts exclusive material and personal data that only the special services have access to. It also posts a ton of 
inhumane, highly toxic content, not just propaganda per se. 
The Dirty Side Of Advertising: Forced Confessions From Belarus On Youtube
YouTube has said that it hasremoved the forced confession ads[46]. But the damage has already been done, the 
videos of Raman Pratasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega have already received 139,000 and 191,000 views 
respectively. While the ads have been stopped, the videos are still there, amongst others, some of which portray 
the opposition as criminals and the government as its victim. And by doing so, the owners of the channel seem able 
to avoidYouTube's Community Guidelines[47]that regulate what is not allowed on the platform. 
For some, these videos might be a stark reminder of how their country treats independent media. For others, they 
are a reminder of an authoritarian regime using taxpayers money and the internet to lie and manipulate their 
citizens. And for some, these videos are just advertising worth 0.01 euros per view. Times five, maybe six million? 
And that's just one channel. 
* Update: on the evening of June 3, the channel uploadedyet another video of Raman Pratasevich[48], this time 
titled: 'Pratasevich: I respect Lukashenka!'. In the video he confesses toorganising mass unrest and regrets urging 
people[49]to protest.

 The European bloc will also forbid EU aircraft from flying over Belarus. A wider sanctions package targeting 
Belarus is expected this month.The EU agreed Friday to ban Belarus-flagged carriers from the airspace and 
airports of the 27-nation bloc and will not permit EU airlines to fly over Belarus. 
The new civilian aviation ban is to sanction Belarus for diverting to Minsk a Ryanair flight that was traveling from 
Athens to Vilnius in order to arrest a prominent dissident blogger, Raman Pratasevich, and his girlfriend, Sofia 
Sepaga. 
An EU statement noted the extent of the ban on Belarusian aviation, requiring member countries "to deny 
permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories," and is set to come into effect at midnight Central 
European Time on Friday. Saturday is the first day the ban will be applied. 
EU ministers agreed last month to sanction the Belarus aviation sector over the May 23 incident. 
How have civil aviation bodies responded to the new rules? 
The European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA) said in a statement that while it understands the 
additional cost and effort to airlines, the ban is needed "to reduce the potential risk to passengers and crews that 
could arise from operations in this airspace." 
However, International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief Willie Walsh was critical of both Minsk and the EU for 
politicizing civilian air travel. IATA members include 290 airlines which account for more than four-fifths of air traffic 
internationally. 
"Two wrongs do not make a right," Walsh said, adding, "Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of 
aircraft and politicians should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas."  
What further sanctions against Belarus are expected? 
EU diplomats are at work on an expanded blacklist. 
The new list is expected to include about 10 officials involved in diverting the airplane as well as dozens of others 
involved in the violent suppression of civil society since disputed elections last August. 
Key industries in Belarus such as fertilizer production will be targeted, as will Belarusian access to the bond market 
in Europe. The broader sanctions package could come into effect later this month. 
The EU has already hit 88 Belarusian officials with visa bans and asset freezes, including President Alexander 
Lukashenko who proclaimed himself the winner of the August presidential election, widely considered to be mired 
by fraud and deemed unfree by the international community. 
EU bans Belarus carriers from its airspace
Belarus faced further widespread condemnation from the international community Friday after state television aired 
a lengthy coerced confession by dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich on Wednesday evening where he was 
speaking under clear signs of duress.

 The European Union announced Friday it is banning all flights from Belarus from flying over EU airspace and 
denying them access to all EU airports. 
In a statement, EU officials said all EU member states will be required to deny permission to land in, take off from or 
overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers, including as a marketing carrier. The ban 
will take effect at midnight Friday, Central European Time.

2019. The move comes in response to the May 23 incident in which Belarus scrambled a fighter jet to order the 
forced landing of an Irish Ryanair commercial airliner that was traversing Belarusian airspace en route to Lithuainia. 
Belarus officials took opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich off the plane and have held him ever since. 
The regional air traffic agency Eurocontrol reports about 400 civilian planes usually take routes over Belarus. 
Several European airlines including Lufthansa, SAS and Air France have already announced they would stop flying 
over its airspace. 
Pratasevich appeared on Belarus state television Thursday, tearfully confessing to his role in anti-government 
protest in an interview that the opposition said was made under duress. 
In the interview, Pratasevich admitted to plotting to topple President Alexander Lukashenko by organizing "riots" 
and recanted earlier criticism of the veteran leader. 
Lukashenko's office did not immediately respond to accusations of coercion.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
This week saw the continuation of pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts to justify the forced diversion and landing of a 
Ryanair flight in Minsk, in order to detain a Belarusian dissident, journalist Raman Pratasevich. 
In a manner similar to disinformation campaigns following the poisoning and arrest of Russian opposition 
politicianAlexey Navalny[2], pro-Kremlin outlets started to claim that this blatant act ofstate-sponsored piracy[3]was 
in fact aprovocationagainst Belarusand that Westernsecret services[4]were involved in it. 
According to the Lithuanian edition of Sputnik, Western secret servicesleaked information about Pratasevich's 
journey[5]to Minsk, as a pretext to ban Belarusian flights over the EU. The Spanish edition of the same outlet 
alleges that the goal of 'Ryanairgate' was tosabotage the Minsk Agreements[6], whereas in Armenia, Sputnik claims 
that Pratasevich simply became aburden[7]on his Western handlers and was abandoned. Abandoned, to 
provokesanctions against Belarus.[8] 
Such messages, although hardly convincing, have several purposes. Firstly, they present the perpetrators as 
victims, aiming to obscure the link between the actions of Belarusian (Russian) authorities and 
theirconsequences[9]for the country. Secondly, presenting Raman Pratasevich (Alexey Navalny) as a tool of 
Western secret services takes away their agency - opposing increasingly authoritarian regimes is thus never a 
matter of individual will, but rather a sinister Western plot. And finally, many different claims, even if mutually 
exclusive and perpetuating some wild conspiracy theories, also serve as a smoke-screen to create confusion about 
what actually happened. We saw such disinformation tactics applied to other difficult-to-defend acts, for instance 
the recent Russianmilitary build-up[10]near Ukraine. 
The World Of Hate: How The Pro-Kremlin Media Continue To Justify The Forced Diversion Of A Ryanair Flight
 On double standards 
 This week, both the pro-Kremlin and Belarusian state-controlled media found one more way to defend the 
embattled Alyaksandr Lukashenka - by blaming the West for alleged 'double standards'. 
The catalyst for this kind of narrative was the unscheduled landing of a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Krakow in 
Berlin on 30 May 2021 due to apossible security threat on board[11]. 
The next morning, the spokesperson of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked, onFacebook[12], why NATO 
did not make a statement and why nobody demanded an international investigation. 
The answer is obvious for anyone outside of the pro-Kremlin disinformation circle: unlike a week earlier, the 
diversion of the flight was not forced, and when no actual danger on the plane was detected,allof the passengers 
continued their journey. 
But the false equivalence was not going to stop the disinformers. The incident was broadly covered on Belarusian 
state-controlled TV, generously sharing the position of the spokesperson of the Russian MFA, and with Belarusian 
politicians alleging that this was the most obvious case of 'double standards[13]'. 
Such a claim is a continuation of a disinformation mantra we observedlast week:[14]it not just that 'everybody does 
it[15]', but, supposedly, it also happens 'all the time[16]'. 
 Denigration of Raman Pratasevich continues 
 In a similar manner, the denigration of Raman Pratasevich continues. The pro-Kremlin media consistently portray 
him not just as a 'bad guy', but a 'very bad guy' - anextremist[17]and amercenary[18], suspected ofgenocide and 
terror[19], having fought alongside 'neo-Nazis[20]' in Ukraine. 
There is no evidence for any of these claims, as the investigation by independent outletMeduza [21]shows, nor are 
they in any way relevant to the case. But for pro-Kremlin outlets, such messages help to kill two birds with one 
stone: not only to discredit the jailed Belarusian dissident, but also to perpetuate the narrative of 'Nazi Ukraine[22]'. 
 The World of Hate 
 The pro-Kremlin disinformation about the forced diversion and landing of a civilian plane the and subsequent arrest 
of a Belarusian journalist aims not only to defend the illegitimate president of Belarus. 
Notably, covering the meeting between the Russian and Belarusian presidents in Sochi, the pro-Kremlin media did 
not have to resort to disinformation,stating[23]that: 
'for Belarus, Russia is now the only neighbour where its planes can fly. This Sochi meeting is to be like no other as 
Belarus has found itself in the deepest crisis with the West ever'. 
No need to lie, the job here is done. 
Nonetheless, focusing on Belarus and international reactions to its actions allows pro-Kremlin spin-doctors to paint 
the world as full of 'double standards' and hate directed at Russia and its friends. In the words of a Russian TV 
hostDmitry Kiselyov[24], currently under EU sanctions: 
'The hatred towards Russia and Belarus, and we are in the same boat here, can be explained by the fact that we 
don't give in to the Western madness - America and Europe - who have abandoned the way of their traditional 
The World Of Hate: How The Pro-Kremlin Media Continue To Justify The Forced Diversion Of A Ryanair Flight
culture, from gay parades and sex-change operations to destroying the monuments of founding fathers and 
admiring Nazism in Ukraine. We are different and in this sense, we are aliens to the West'. 
The world of disinformation indeed is a dark and alienating one.

 Detained blogger Roman Protasevich praised Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko on state TV Thursday. The 
26-year-old faces terrorism charges after he was pulled off a diverted Ryanair flight forced to land in Minsk. 
Protasevich's parents have previously said they believe their son is being tortured and forced to confess. See more 
stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Journalist and activist Roman Protasevich appeared[2] on Belarusian state TV on Thursday to praise Belarus' 
authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, and confess to organizing "mass unrest." 
The confession interview comes 10 days after Protasevich was removed from a Ryanair flight when the plane was 
forced to land in Minsk. -Matthew Luxmoore (@mjluxmoore) June 3, 2021[3] "I realized that many things 
[Lukashenko] is criticized for are just attempts to pressure him, and that in many moments he acted like...a  man 
with balls of steel," Protasevich says in the video. 
Protasevich potentially faces the death penalty for charges of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots. Read the

Belarus : Raman Pratasevich appears in another prison video

 The journalist, arrested aboard a Ryanair flight, said in the video on state TV that staging protests now would be 
pointless, urging the opposition to wait for a more opportune moment.A dissident journalist arrested when Belarus 
diverted his flight appeared again in a video broadcast by Belarusian state media late Wednesday. 
Raman Pratasevich had admitted to charges of organizing protests in a video aired last week. 
Belarusian opposition said the 26-year-old journalist was pressured to appear in the confession video. His parents, 
who now live in Poland, said the confession seemed to be coerced. Nevertheless, the state-controlled ONT channel 
aired another sit-down with the captive activist late on Wednesday.  
What did Pratasevich say? 
In his latest appearance, Pratasevich said he saw no point in protesting in Belarus against President Alexander 
Lukashenko at the moment, saying that the movement has lost impetus. 
Instead, he argued, the opposition should wait until economic problems trigger broad public discontent. 
"We need to wait until the economic situation worsens... and people take to the street for a mug of soup, to put it 
bluntly,'' he said.  
Pratasevich also said that an unidentified associate had set him up. He explained that he had put a notice about his 
travel plans in a chat with associates some 40 minutes before his departure.  
He speculated that someone with whom he had a personal conflict could have issued the bomb threat, which 
Belarusian officials at the time claimed as the reason why they forced the flight to land in Minsk.  
"The first thing I thought was that I have been set up,'' Pratasevich said. 
Ties to the opposition? 
Pratasevich accused the unidentified associate of having links with opposition hackers who had previously attacked 
Belarusian official websites and issued bomb threats. 
According to the Associated Press, Pratasevich had noted last month that he had a rift with Franak Viachorka, an 
adviser to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 
Commenting on the video, Viachorka told AP that Pratasevich's comments should be disregarded because he is 
now "a hostage under pressure," insisting the two had friendly ties. 
There was no immediate response from Tsikhanouskaya. 
Why is Pratasevich detained?  
Pratasevich has become a top foe of Lukashenko as he ran a widely popular channel on the Telegram messaging 
app that played a major role in helping organize the massive anti-government demonstrations.  
Belarus : Raman Pratasevich appears in another prison video
He was charged with inciting mass disturbances and could face up to a 15-year prison sentence. 
Last week, Lukashenko laccused Pratasevich of fomenting a "bloody rebellion." 
Belarus had forced a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk on May 23, citing a bomb threat. 
Belarusian security forces arrested Pratasevich and his girlfriend, triggering outrage. 
The European Union demanded his immediate release and imposed sanctions on Belarus.

Cold War Over EU Skies: Germany Blocks All Inbound Russian Flights In Huge Escalation

Here we go again in the latest tit-for-tat escalation following the May 23rd forced diversion of the Ryanair flight 
carrying anti-Lukashenko activist and journalistRoman Pratasevich by Belarus, who was subsequently arrested 
when the plane landed in Minsk: Russia and Germany have just denied each others' airlines permission for 
incoming flights. 
 AFP is confirming[3] that 'Germany has blocked flights operated by Russian airlines from arriving in its territory in 
tit-for-tat action after Moscow failed to provide authorizations for Lufthansa, the transport ministry said Wednesday, 
amid tensions over Belarus.' 
 https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/lufthansafile.jpg?itok=eL7pU8HL 
Days ago Moscow had begun blocking European carriers which were actively avoiding Belarusian airspace, also as 
Russia's former Soviet satellite state ally was targeted for expanded EU sanctions, including an imminent expected 
blacklisting of national carrier Belavia. 
 The Bidenadministration is also said to be drawing up a list of targeted sanctions, but for now it's looking like a new 
Cold War over the skies of Europe is playing out, potentially severely disrupting popular international travel and 
transit routes and leading to a worsened diplomatic standoff. 
 Germany's transport ministry said on Wednesday that it had denied three RussianAeroflot flights access to its 
airspace and another four on Wednesday in response to prior Lufthansa flight cancelations that were the direct 
result of Russian policy[4]: 
'Due to the reciprocal practice, the Federal Aviation Authority also did not issue any further permits for flights 
operated by Russian airlines as long as authorizations are pending on the Russian side,' it added. 
 .'Once permits for Lufthansa flights are granted by the Russian site, the flights of Russian airlines will also be 
authorized,' added the German ministry. 
Cold War Over EU Skies: Germany Blocks All Inbound Russian Flights In Huge Escalation
Recall too that Air France flights had been impacted by lack of Russian flight path approval as early as a week ago 
after broad EU-wide avoidance of Belarusian airspace. The Kremlin had tried to downplay it at the time as vaguely 
based on 'technical' reasons. 
 As the below comment from an Atlantic Council pundit reveals, the May 23 Ryanair incident is increasingly being 
blamed on Putin's Russia, given his longtime support for the Belarusian strongman 
 #Germany[5] does not exclude #Russia[6]'s involvement in the Ryanair incident.This was stated by the head of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag,Norbert Röttgen. #Putin[7] has been supporting #Lukashenko[8] for 
years,it is partly because of Russia that Lukashenko is still in power pic.twitter.com/We6zYwkTvC[9] 
 — Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) May 26, 2021[10] 
 Further upping the ante, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg weighed in on Wednesday saying more 
punitive actions are on the table my the Western military alliance over what was widely condemned as 
Lukashenko's authorized 'state hijacking' of the Ryanair flight last month. 
 'I think the most important thing now is to make sure that those sanctions that are agreed are fully implemented,' he 
said [11]in what's looking to be a major coordinated sanctions avalanche involving the US, EU, and UK. 'It has to be 
clear that when a regime like the regime in Minsk behaves in the way they did, violating basic international norms 
and rules, we will impose costs on them.'

Russia Forming 20 New Military Units To 'Counter NATO' Near Western Border

 On Monday Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced decisions reached in a meeting with top military 
officials which mark a continued significant escalation with NATO. The Associated Press described of his 
statements[3], "He pointed to a growing number of flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russia's borders, 
deployments of NATO warships and increasingly frequent and massive drills by alliance forces." 
 "The US and NATO continue to expand the scope of operational and combat training near our borders," the 
Russian defense minister explained. "The actions of our Western counterparts are destroying the security system in 
the world and forcing us to take adequate countermeasures. We are constantly improving the combat composition 
of the troops."  
 And that's when he proposed a specific military response includingthe formation of 20 new units to be permanently 
based in the Western Military District. "By the end of the year, about 20 formations and military units will be formed 
in the Western Military District," Shoigu said.  
  
 This will no doubt be taken as a deeply threatening move in the West, given it's precisely the expanded Russian 
military war drills and additional troop build-up along Ukraine's border which sparked the latest crisis and sanctions 
tit-for-tat of late March and which reached its height in April. But it bears reminding that the Russian military is 
merely talking about troop positionswithin its own sovereign borders- though apparently this remains hugely 
"threatening" for the West.  
Russia Forming 20 New Military Units To 'Counter NATO' Near Western Border
 Presumably the 20 new military units for the purpose of 'countering NATO' will be able to react even more swiftly to 
any escalating crisis in Crimea or Donbas.AP notes of Defense MinisterShoigu's statements:"He added the military 
units in Western Russia have commissioned about 2,000 new pieces of weaponry this year."  
 Interestingly Belarus and its longtime ruling strongmanAlexander Lukashenko are also increasingly front and center 
in terms of the Russia-NATO standoff and Eastern European and Baltic fault line, particularly after the recent 
Ryanair plane diversion and detention of anti-Lukashekno activist Roman Protasevich.  
 Shoigu also announced[4]planned-for major joint Russia-Belarusian military exercises to take place in upcoming 
months. "Preparations for Zapad-2021 joint strategic Russian-Belarusian exercise, which will take place in 
September at the training grounds of Belarus and the Western Military District, have entered an active phase. A 
number of command post exercises have already been carried out with the involvement of headquarters of various 
levels," he said.  
 Sergei Shoigu with Vladimir Putin, via Wiki Commons 
  
 However,Shoigu noted its "exclusively defense character" - no doubt wary of growing accusations from the US and 
its allies of the Kremlin's supposed 'expansionist' ambitions.  
 "I want to emphasize that the Zapad-2021 exercise is planned. It is carried out by decision of the presidents of 
Russia and Belarus and is exclusively defensive in nature," he said."Within the time frame established by 
international treaties, our partners will be informed about the parameters of the exercise, and the event itself will be 
able to be visited by international observers and journalists."

 Stepan Latypov, 41, was filmed trying to cut his own throat with a pen in court on Tuesday. Latypov was arrested in 
a crackdown on dissent by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko's regime. It comes days after Belarus forced a 
Ryanair flight to land in order to arrest another opposition figure. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
A Belarusian prisoner detained in protests against President Alexander Lukashenko's[2] disputed reelection was 
filmed stabbing himself in court on Tuesday after saying he was tortured and threatened by the police.  
According to Viasna[3], a human rights organization, 41-year-old Stepan Latypov said he had been tortured in a jail 
cell for 51 days, and that police told him that his family and neighbors would face prosecution if he did not plead 
guilty to the charges against him.  
Latypov then proceeded to stab himself with an object that appeared to be a pen.  
A friend of Latypov, named Irina, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that he "took something white in his teeth, 
and started literally to cut his throat. Everyone started screaming. Police officers could not open the defendant's 
cage for awhile. He fell unconscious. We were taken out of the courtroom," according to Reuters[4].  
Viasna and other local media report that Latypov is still alive, Reuters reports. Belarus' Health Ministry said that a 
41-year-old man who stabbed himself in a courtroom is in stable condition after being treated under anaesthetic, 
according to Reuters.  
Latypov was arrested in September while trying to stop state workers from trying to paint over an opposition mural 
in his apartment's courtyard, according to Reuters and The New York Times[5]. He faces charges of organizing 
riots, resisting police, and fraud, according to Reuters.  
There was widespread unrest in Belarus in August and September, when President Lukashenko won reelection by 
an overwhelming margin - a result the European Union dismissed as fraudulent.  
He is one of 454 political prisoners currently behind held by the country's law enforcement, according to a list 
published by Viasna.  
Latypov's apparent suicide attempt comes just days after Belarus forced a Ryanair flight traveling from Greece to 
Lithuania to land, in order to arrest another opposition figure, Roman Protasevich[6]. The EU has responded to that 
incident by banning Belarusian planes[7] from its airspace and establishing a no-fly zone over the country.

Belarusians have been fleeing the country since the disputed presidential election last summer, but on Tuesday,the 
country made it hard for those remaining to leave.[8] Now, only those with permanent residencies in other countries 
will be allowed to leave, according to The Times. Read the original article on Business Insider[9]

 A Belarusian activist was taken to hospital following a court appearance in Minsk. A video appeared to show 
Stsiapan Latypau collapsing after stabbing himself with what appeared to be a pen.A Belarusian activist on 
Tuesday reportedly stabbed himself in the neck during a court appearance in the capital, Minsk. 
The dramatic courtroom scene comes as the government of Belarus faces increasing pressure over the harsh 
crackdown on anti-government demonstrations that erupted last year. 
What happened? 
A video appeared to show Stsiapan Latypau, named as well in media reports as Stepan Latypov under a different 
spelling, collapsing after using what looked like a pen as a weapon as he appeared before judges on charges of 
resisting arrest and staging actions that violate public order. 
The 41-year-old is currently being treated in hospital. The Belarusian Health Ministry said that he is conscious and 
in "stable condition." 
Viasna, an independent rights group monitoring the trial of Latypau, said it believed the activist harmed himself due 
to pressure he underwent in detention. 
The dramatic scene came after Latypau's father appeared as a witness in court. 
Following the questioning, Latypau addressed his father — saying that investigators threatened to open cases 
against his relatives if he did not admit his guilt, according to Viasna. 
He then stabbed himself in the neck with an object that appeared to be a pen. 
"Stsiapan turned blue and lay down on the bench, an ambulance was called," Viasna reported. 
Why was he on trial? 
Latypau was detained in September last year during widespread protests that erupted following disputed 
presidential elections that saw longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko claim a sixth term. 
Tuesday marked the start of Latypau's trial. He faces several charges — including resisting law enforcement that 
could amount to up to 10 years in prison. 
Viasna and other rights groups declared him a political prisoner and have been monitoring the legal proceedings 
against him. 
Crackdown on protesters 
Belarus activist reportedly stabs himself in court
Some 35,000 people — including protesters, opposition figures and journalists — have been arrested by security 
forces in Belarus in a crackdown on the demonstrations. 
Those in detention describe brutal conditions. DW reporter Alexander Burakov was released on Tuesday after 
spending 20 days in detention in Belarus. He described the treatment as "cruel and violent."  
Lukashenko's government has come under increasing pressure following the forced diversion of a Ryanair 
passenger plane in late May and the arrest of dissident blogger Raman Pratasevich.

 The ministers will review a communique being drafted for the June 14 summit in Brussels, taking place amid the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan and continued tension with Russia.The NATO allies' defense and foreign ministers are 
meeting on Tuesday to prepare for the June 14 summit, which US President Joe Biden will attend. 
On the ministers' agenda are the latest developments in Ukraine and Belarus as well as NATO's future ties with 
Russia. 
The ministers are also expected to discuss the alliance's role in Afghanistan as it withdraws NATO troops. 
The way forward in Afghanistan 
As NATO withdraws troops from Afghanistan after two decades, allies have been considering the future of their ties 
with Kabul. 
The UK announced that it would accelerate the relocation of its Afghan staff who worked with the military, often as 
interpreters, ahead of the planned withdrawal. Germany had also made a similar announcement. 
Biden had said that the US would pull out its troops from Afghanistan by September 11. NATO troops are expected 
to leave by that date if they have not already. 
Critics have raised concerns over the decision, fearing it could lead to the Taliban taking over the more urban parts 
of the country which it does not control. 
Tensions with Belarus 
Stoltenberg announced on Monday that the alliance would restrict access to its headquarters in Brussels for 
Belarusian officials. 
Stoltenberg's announcement came in the wake of the forced Ryanair flight diversion that sparked international 
outrage. 
In a joint statement last week, NATO's 30 member states condemned Belarus' move and called for the immediate 
release of Raman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who were arrested aboard the Ryanair flight. 
"We have also clearly stated that we welcome the decision by many NATO allies to impose sanctions, including 
restricting the access of the Belarussian airliner to their airspace," Stoltenberg said. 
NATO mulls response to Russia 
Russia is high on the June summit agenda as relations between NATO allies and Moscow have hit a new low. 
The Kremlin announced Monday that Russia would deploy an additional 20 military units in the country's western 
border areas by the end of the year. 
NATO ministers meet to lay groundwork for summit
"What we see is a pattern of Russian behavior where Russia over the last years has invested heavily in new 
modern military capabilities from conventional to nuclear weapon systems," Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday. 
"Not only that but that Russia has been willing to use military force against neighbors in Georgia and Ukraine, 
continuing to destabilize Donbas and eastern Ukraine and illegally annexing Crimea." 
NATO allies repeatedly raised concerns over tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin had recently 
ordered troops back from the border with Ukraine, after a military buildup. 
"Our message remains clear: We are prepared for dialogue, and we have made proposals, but the key to a better 
relationship lies clearly with Moscow," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters ahead of Tuesday's 
meeting.  
Ukraine keen on German military gear 
Meanwhile, Ukraine's president enthusiastically picked up on a suggestion from a leading German Green politician 
made recently during a visit to Kyiv. Green party co-chair Robert Habeck had suggested that Germany could sell 
military equipment to Ukraine.  
"Germany has not given us any military aid, but it could do that," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper's Tuesday edition. "Habeck understood that."  
Habeck, who had called for supplying Ukraine with "defensive weapons," later clarified that he had meant "night 
vision devices, reconnaissance devices, ordinance disposal" and vehicles for medical evacuation. 
Maas said ahead of the NATO meeting that arm deliveries to Ukraine will not help reach a political solution.  
 Firsts for Biden 
Biden, who will be attending his first NATO summit as president, will also meet Russia's President Vladimir Putin 
two days after in Geneva. 
Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the US should expect an array of "uncomfortable" signals in 
the coming days and ahead of the anticipated first meeting between the two leaders. 
US relations with NATO were strained under Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, with Biden making clear before 
and after his election that he intended to change this.

 A Belarusian opposition activist stabbed himself in the throat with a pen during a court hearing in Minsk on 
Tuesday to protest what he claimed were threats from authorities to arrest his family members and friends if he did 
not plead guilty to organizing protests against the country's authoritarian ruler, President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Footage from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty showed Stsiapan Latypau lying limp on a bench in the defendant's 
cage after his self-inflicted wounding as guards tended to him. 
The video showed him being carried unconscious from the courthouse on a stretcher, his neck wrapped in a white 
cloth, and put into an ambulance. 
The Viasna human rights center in Belarus said Latypau was put into an induced coma. His lawyer declined to 
comment on his condition. 
Before he stabbed himself, Latypau climbed on the bench in the cage and claimed investigators had told him, 'If I 
don't plead guilty, they will open criminal cases against my family and neighbors.' 
Latypau has been held since September 2020 on various charges, including accusations that he staged actions 
violating the public order in last summer's vast protests against Lukashenko. The street demonstrations occurred 
after the strongman claimed a sixth presidential election victory with 80% of the vote. 
If convicted, Latypau faces up to 10 years in prison. 
Latypau's apparent attempted suicide is the latest incident with links to protests against Lukashenko. Last week, an 
opposition politician died in prison under unclear circumstances, while a teenager under investigation for protesting 
committed suicide by throwing himself from a 16-story building. 
'This is the result of state terror, repressions, torture in Belarus,' wrote Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, an opposition 
leader. 'We must stop it immediately!' 
Belarus Opposition Activist Stabs Himself in Court Hearing
Many governments, except Russia, a close ally of Belarus, condemned Lukashenko last month after he diverted a 
Ryanair jetliner flying over Belarus and carrying Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian activist who had fled the country 
in 2019 and had since lived in exile. 
Pratasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega, were arrested when the flight landed in Minsk on the purported 
claim of a bomb aboard the aircraft, although no explosive was found. 
In response, European countries stopped flying over Belarus, depriving Minsk of overflight revenue, and blocked 
flights by Belavia, the Belarusian state air carrier, from landing in European cities. 
Lukashenko met with Russian President Vladimir Putin late last week to shore up support with his government's key 
foreign ally. On Tuesday, Lukashenko announced Belarus would soon open direct flights with Crimea, the Ukrainian 
peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, although Western governments do not recognize Moscow's claim to the 
territory.

Jun 01, 2021( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: https://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 I grew up as a fan-boy of all things Marvel, and have been delighted with the way the Marvel Universe has panned 
out for next generations. In particular, Spider-Man has always been a highlight, and I regularly use one of the lines 
from these comic books: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. 
 Attributed as a line to Peter Parker's Uncle Ben, it actually originated in the Amazing Fantasy 15 (1962), the first 
Spider-Man Marvel comic, as a caption. 
 https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Great-power.png 
 However, if you do further investigation some say it was a line introduced by Voltaire during the French Revolution, 
although I cannot find any direct evidence of this via Google. Equally, I prefer to think it was a variation of this line 
from Luke 12:48 in the Christian Bible: 
 'From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted 
with much, much more will be asked.' 
 Anyway, I diverge. Why is this important? Because it's a theme I've used often in banking and finance. Money 
creates power and with great power comes great responsibility; more than this though is that power creates wealth. 
In fact, it's a virtuous circle: the more money you have the more powerful you become and the more powerful you 
become the more money you generate. 
 It is for this reason that some of those in power can become dictators, such as Saddam Hussein of Iraq[1]. After 
the Iraq War: 
 US forces broke through a wall in a small building in Iraq in April 2003 and found a number of metal boxes, each 
containing crisp new American dollar bills. They must have thought it was their lucky day because, by the end of 
that day, they had discovered 164 of these boxes around Baghdad with a value to the tune of $650 million. It may 
have been a lot more than that, but that is how much was declared. 
 Thing is, before the war, he needed that secret stash to buy favours, pay off protesters and enemies, cover the 
costs of his personal army and police force, and ensure that the Imams followed his lead. In other words, money 
creates power and power creates more money to keep the power. 
 That is the nature of some dictatorships, and this hits home when I look at Belarus today. 
With Great Power Comes Great Wealth
 Alexander Lukashenko is purely keeping his power because all of the state forces are on his payroll. That's why he 
can bring down a Ryanair flight and no one in Belarus can do anything about it, even if the rest of the world is 
shocked. 
 https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Putin.jpg 
 In a similar way, why do you think Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has remained in power for so long? It's over two 
decades since he first took office and he stays in power because he is popular with the oligarchs and state forces. 
He rewards them, and looks after them. In return, they protect him and do what he asks. If they don't do what he 
asks, a spot of Novichok does the trick. 
 But then we in the rest of the world may look at these leaders as bad, but are ours any better? 
 With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. 
 When I look at Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Nicolas Sarkozy, Benjamin Netanyahuand many other leaders, we 
can see their web of deceit. The web is funded by greed and wealth to create more and more power to create more 
and more wealth. It is the reason why politics is called politics. The term politics comes from the Latin 
polyformanyandticsas inblood-sucking parasites. 
 This reminds me of the time I heard the portrait photographer Platon[2] talking about his career and how it started 
with an unusual angle on Bill Clinton. At one United Nations Summit, he was given the privilege of photographing 
every world leader attending from Gadhafi to Berlusconi. On presenting these photographs, he noted that nearly 
every single leader was now on trial for corruption, fraud, bankruptcy or just generally on-the-run, and most of these 
leaders were men. 
 But it is changing. When we talk about great leaders of today, many of them are great women[3]. Whether it has 
been New Zealand under Jacinda Ardern or Taiwan under the presidency of Tsai Ing-Wen or Germany under 
Angela Merkel, female-led countries have been held up as good examples of how to manage a pandemic. 
 Is that because women have a different attitude towards wealth and power to men? 
 From The New York Times[4]: 
 Many women, those who grew up wealthy and those who did not, have long been steered away from the 
unapologetic drive for wealth. 
 It's bound up with the way girls are often schooled to place the needs of others above their own, to repress or deny 
outward signs of ambition. Even as women have pushed into once-male bastions in business, many still feel the 
sting of professional and personal backlash if they are perceived as too aggressive. 
 'Girls as they are growing up are not socialized to feel that it's O.K. for them to have ambition about creating 
wealth, not the way it is for little boys,' said Mariko Chang, the author of 'Shortchanged,' a study of the wealth gap 
between men and women. 'They're encouraged to take on roles that let them take care of other people'  
 From her perches both in investment banking and city government, [Alicia Glen, New York's deputy mayor for 
housing and economic development] has watched men relish the rewards money brings  
 Many women I interviewed said they viewed money as a means to help others rather than to increase their own 
profile. Those attitudes, admirable as they may be, have helped fuel a power gap that separates men and women. 
 Of course, many recoil at the idea that women should pursue money and clout just the way men do. That flies in 
the face of increasing political anger about inequality. There's a longstanding rift in the women's movement and 
beyond: Does the path to power require acting more like men, or can women wield influence in ways that are 
different but just as effective? 
 'There are men for whom there is no amount of money that is enough,' [Joline Godfrey, author of the book 'Raising 
Financially Fit Kids'] said. 'The quest of more, bigger, better has taken this planet to a place of unsustainability. It 
seems to me that women are making different choices. And those choices may be healthier for all of us.' 
 The article[5] is well worth a read, and sits on trend with all of my experiences in business, banking and tech. The 
male view of the world is greed is good, and its very difficult to untie that. The male view of the world is of an army 
of troops who you command. The male view of the world is beat all the others, no matter what cost. 
 The male view of the world is a balloon that has a massive needle hanging over it. The needle is called women. 
 The female view of the world is wealth can help. The female view of the world is to raise and nurture. The female 
view of the world is to support and counsel. The female view of the world is if we can raise one, we can raise all. 
 I'm being stereotypical and will probably get called out as some woke misogynist, but I was talking about such 
things way back in the 1990s. My first boss was a woman; because I was in marketing, where most women work in 
department that 'makes things pretty'.I worked for women most of my initial career; working for and with women 
made the environment far more fun and equitable than when I worked with most men. 
With Great Power Comes Great Wealth
 I just can't believe that it's still a thing thirty years later. But the thing is changing[6]. We now have Citi Group run by 
Jane Fraser and Stephanie Cohen a likely successor to David Solomon at Goldman Sachs; we have Alison Rose 
running NatWest and Ana Botin at Santander Group; and we mustn't forget Christine Lagarde at the ECB and the 
many other powerful women of the world[7]. 
 The trend is notable. The trend is that world leaders, prime ministers, CEOs, bank and investment focused people, 
are becoming more and more oriented towards Mother Earth and female virtues, driven by wealth to do good for 
society and the planet. That world is very different. 
 Oh, and don't think I'm saying women are taking over the world. They will be lucky if they're even considered equal 
two centuries from now.

 Belarus is temporarily preventing most of its citizens from leaving the country amid crackdowns against critics of 
President Alexander Lukashenko. 
In a statement on Telegram seen by the BBC[1], the State Border Committee said only some government workers 
and citizens with permanent residency in other countries will be allowed to leave. 
The agency blamed the COVID-19 for the travel ban, but it comes only weeks after 26-year old journalist Roman 
Protasevich[2], a staunch critic of Lukashenko's, was arrested when his Ryanair flight was diverted. Several other 
critics have also been detained BBC reported.

 Police searched the machine during the night after it requested emergency authorization to land in the German 
capital.A Ryanair passenger plane flying between Ireland and Poland made an emergency landing in Berlin on 
Sunday, German police said. 
How events unfolded 
The flight with 160 people on board was en route from Dublin to Krakow when it arrived at the Berlin-Brandenburg 
airport shortly after 8 p.m. (1800 UTC) on Sunday. It remained grounded at the airport into early Monday morning.  
Germany's federal police arrived at the scene. They used detection dogs to inspect baggage before it was taken 
inside the airport. 
A Berlin police spokeswoman said that officers had completed their security checks but they had not detected any 
danger. 
"The passengers will resume their journey to Poland aboard a different airplane," the police spokeswoman told 
news agency AFP, without providing further information. 
Passengers were able to travel on in a replacement plane at around 4 a.m. local time. 
Reason for unscheduled landing not yet clear 
The Ryanair plane made the landing after reporting an air emergency and "was therefore immediately given a 
landing permit at BER," airport spokesman Jan-Peter Haack told German tabloid newspaper Bild. 
Bild reported that the unexpected diversion came after a reported bomb threat but police did not publicly comment 
on details of the operation. 
The incident took place a week after another Ryanair flight was forced to land in Belarus' capital Minsk before 
authorities arrested a journalist onboard. The forced diversion prompted international outcry and the European 
Union subsequently urged its airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. 
The official reason given for the forced diversion of the Ryanair flight by Belarus earlier in May was a reported bomb 
threat. 
In July last year, another Ryanair plane from Dublin to Krakow was forced to make an emergency landing in London 
after a false bomb threat.

UN GATE, May 30 - Right after dissident blogger Pratasevich was grabbed off a Ryan Air flight forced to land in

 Now on May 30, The chief editor of a popular Belarusian news site has been detained on Sunday and his home 
searched. Aliaksei Shota, editor of Hrodna.life, was detained with police officers claiming he was being investigated 
on suspicion of extremism. His site focuses on Grodno, Belarus's fifth-largest city. Authorities said Shota 'posted 
information products that were duly recognized as extremist.' 
 Officers confiscated computer hard drives from his home. Shota had worked with with Belarus's most popular 
internet portal Tut.by, before it was shut down by the government this month after 15 employees were arrested. 
From Guterres? Silence - he wants all P5 support for a second term. 
 On May 28, Guterres' UN Press Briefing Room hosted a press conference, from which Inner City Press was

 Minsk's border agency has announced new rules that will make it nearly impossible to leave the country. As 
citizens attempt to flee Belarus, longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko appears to be closing all the exits.Belarus' 
border security agency on Monday announced a severe tightening of already strict rules limiting citizens' ability to 
exit the country — even if they have long-term residency permits abroad. 
The changes, which the agency said were temporary and designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, 
essentially block all land border crossings.  
Ever more citizens have fled the former Soviet bloc country since Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner 
of a disputed presidential election last August and mass protests over election rigging were met with a severe 
crackdown. 
What changes under the new rules? 
Faced with the prospect of a mass exodus of medical and IT experts, the government in Minsk began making it 
more difficult for citizens to leave the country last December, by limiting departures to those Belarus citizens who 
could present long-term residency permits from abroad. 
The new rules now forbid the holders of such documents from leaving as well. Those who can prove that they have 
permanent resident status in another country will be permitted to travel abroad. 
Opposition slams 'violation of the law' 
Valery Kavaleuski, a representative for Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took to Twitter to 
express his outrage, calling the move an "outright violation of the law."  
Air travel to and from the country has also come to a virtual standstill in the wake of last week's government-
ordered diversion of a Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania. 
The commercial jet was forced to land under false pretenses so that Belarus authorities could arrest blogger and 
Lukashenko critic Raman Pratasevich. 
The move outraged the wider world with the EU blocking most flights to and over Belarus. 
State carrier Belavia, in return, cancelled all flights to the EU — leaving those who wish to leave Belarus 
increasingly worried and running out of options.

 Exiled Belarusians and international supporters have joined forces to form the German nonprofit Razam. They are 
showing their support by taking to the streets and showing solidarity with the opposition in Belarus.Anton Niadzelka 
lives in Berlin, but his heart is in his homeland, Belarus. The last time he visited the capital, Minsk, was two years 
ago. The 31-year-old mathematician has lived the last 10 in Potsdam, a city just outside Berlin. In April, he took 
over the chairmanship of Razam ("together," in Belarusian), a cultural nonprofit based in Germany. 
Razam's 220 members have one goal: help end the autocratic rule of Alexander Lukashenko, no matter how 
improbable that may seem. 
"We're taking care of those in prison," Niadzelka told DW. "We collect donations and send them to Belarus to help 
families there. We distribute information and hold discussions with governments around the European Union." 
Razam also looks after those who have fled, but "with the air routes blocked, that has become more difficult," 
Niadzelka said. 
State-sponsored terrorism in the sky 
The EU has ordered a halt to air traffic with Belarus since last week's forced landing of a Ryanair flight, which led to 
the arrest of leading opposition figures who were onboard, including exiled journalist and activist Raman Pratasevic, 
as well as his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen. 
Razam gathered about 300 people last weekend at Berlin's busy Potsdamer Platz to protest what the organization 
considers an act of state-sponsored terrorism. 
"This hijacking is just the beginning," Heinrich Kirschbaum, a Slavic literature professor from Freiburg, Germany, 
told the protesters. "Lukashenko's crimes affect all of Europe, not just Belarus. He's becoming more and more 
unpredictable because he knows he can get away with it. Like he has for 27 years." 
Mixed feelings about flight ban 
Whether organizing demonstrations or events, or networking with like-minded groups, Niadzelka does what he can 
from Germany to support the opposition in Belarus. He has mixed feelings about the EU's quick response to stop 
air traffic to Belarus, which he sees as a means to prevent something similar from happening again. 
"But of course we'd like to see people from Belarus still be able to fly here," he said. 
Sanctions for companies linked to Lukashenko 
Niadzelka would like to see sanctions against companies that he says exist only to line the Belarusian president's 
pockets. The EU has refused to recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate leader of Belarus since last summer's 
elections were deemed neither free nor fair. Mass street protests against the result have been met with state

violence and the jailing of some 450 people, according to Razam. Some of them were pictured on a large banner at 
the weekend demonstration in Berlin. 
The latest round of civil unrest recalls a similar bout of popular anger about 10 years ago, when Belarus teetered on 
bankruptcy and was crushed by massive inflation. Then, as now, Lukashenko held onto power with the help from 
Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
"[Lukashenko] can see that he has fewer people within his security services standing by him. The economy is in 
bad shape. He doesn't have much money to pay back debt," Niadzelka said. "In 2011 he was able to get everything 
quickly under control. That's not the case this time around." 
Niadzelka hopes to see the mass protests in Belarus continue to grow, as they have in Germany, but he worries 
that it is getting harder to do so. That is why he and his friends wear photos of those in jail, speak to the media, and 
reach out to allies across Eastern Europe and Russia. Everything is for the goal of ending the decadeslong reign of 
the man often referred to as Europe's last dictator.

 By for Georgian Institute for Security Policy[1] 
On May 18, Belarus' most popular internet portal TUT.by was shut down. In addition to the editorial office, 
journalists were also searched and 15 employees of the newspaper were arrested. 
There is no rest for the wicked, they say, and if it's indeed true, then Belarus strongman President Alexander 
Lukashenko might just be suffering from acute insomnia. Shutting down TUT.by evidently couldn't sate his appetite, 
though, as, on Sunday, May 23, he committed a direct act of state terrorism: a Belarusian fighter jet forced a 
Ryanair flight, which was flying from Athens to Vilnius, to land at Minsk Airport. After the forced landing, passenger 
Roman Protasevich, founder and ex-editor of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta was promptly arrested. 
While the West ponders a new round of sanctions, the pivotal question puzzling analysts and opinion-makers alike 
is what is on Lukashenko's mind? Why is the self-proclaimed president so willing to aggravate things even further? 
Especially in a situation where active protests in the country have been suppressed and his power, at least in the 
immediate future, seems no longer threatened? These were the questions GISP asked Maria Avdeeva, Research 
Director at the European Expert Association. 
The Protasevich incident has already been dubbed an 'act of state terrorism,' and inducted Lukashenka into an 
increasingly narrow group of international pariah leaders. Is there a way out of this for him to ever be considered as 
a legitimate political figure again? 
The crimes committed against his own population after the 2020 elections already made another rapprochement 
with the West very unlikely. However, one shouldn't still completely rule it out: previously, Lukashenko got away 
with even killing his political opponents. And yet, this last incident might just prove to be the final step that went too 
far. If there is any winner in this situation, it's Russia - as the already miniscule field for dialogue between 
Lukashenko and the West has diminished further, and now he is even more dependent on Russia. 
Lukashenko 'The Avia-Pirate' - Steadying The Sinking Ship?
It also highlights the impact of the 2020 protests on the Lukashenko regime, of its transformation. Whereas 
previously there was room for 'system liberals,' now they have been entirely replaced by the 'Siloviki'. But relying 
exclusively on the Siloviki has its own peculiarities. Now, the Belarusian regime is doomed to search for new 
enemies - the siloviki need a trademark outer threat to demonstrate their indispensability. And although, in the short 
term, this helps to keep the situation under control, it simultaneously shortens the regime's days. The political 
system built by Lukashenko is gradually moving into self-destructive mode. 
Shutting down Tut.by, kidnapping Protasevich - Lukashenko might think he is winning a battle but might he be 
losing the war? 
He is losing the war against his own people, as his position becomes more and more precarious, with precious little 
room for political maneuvers. In the eyes of the Belarus people, he is already an outcast, no longer one of their 
own. He might himself entertain notions to the contrary, and console himself with thoughts that there are no large 
scale protests anymore, his naysayers are in jail, that he succeeded to terrorize a whole nation into submission, but 
there is no way for him to get the trust of the people back. That bridge was burnt long ago, and it's only a matter of 
time before he starts losing the battles as well. 
His decree provides for the transfer of presidential powers to the Security Council of Belarus in the event of an 
emergency. What are the implications of such a move? 
He himself dubbed it a 'historic decree'. It's a military junta scenario; it tells the Belarusians 'whatever you do, 
nothing will change. If I am no longer around, the military will rule the country.' He wants to give the impression that 
he has everything under control, that nothing will happen and his regime will stay in power. It's also a precaution: if 
things go pear-shaped for him, he doesn't want all his power to be in one person's hand, which constitutionally 
would be the Prime Minister. On the foreign policy front, it's also a bow towards the Kremlin, indicating that 
Lukashenko's past bargaining with the West might be truly over and that now he is firmly in their grasp. 
For decades, Lukashenko was seen as trying to make his Presidency hereditary - given the current situation, is this 
scenario still on the cards? 
I think it might be shelved, but that doesn't mean it has been cancelled altogether. He is very worried about his 
sons, his family - by now, these might well be the only people that won't betray him given the chance. If Russia 
doesn't guarantee their well-being and safety, he should take care of that himself. As for transferring presidential 
powers to his offspring, I am sure he still entertains the notion, but his youngest son, whom he reared for such 
eventuality, is still too young. Trouble came knocking at Lukashenko's door earlier than he'd have liked. 
We need to discuss the so-called 'assassination' attempt as well- what was that all about? Who buys the narrative 
that the West ordered Lukashenko's death? 
Supporters of Lukashenko, and to an extent, Putin, more or less do believe what they are told. Especially the older 
generation for whom the state-run TV channels are the main source of information. Another thing it accomplishes is 
distraction from actual events and, obviously, giving the Kremlin propaganda, another lever to use in their Anti-
Western rhetoric. Even Putin mentioned it in his speech in front of the federal assembly. 
Increasingly, it looks like Lukashenko is cornered. And cornered predators, as they say, are at the most dangerous. 
What's the most dangerous move he could pull off? 
I'm very worried about the Belarusian people. What we are witnessing now exceeds any limits. 15 journalists in jail 
at the moment, charges all politically motivated, and tomorrow this number could rise to 150. And Lukashenko will 
keep on going - he sees the reaction from the West, but seems to think it's a risk worth taking. 
Lukashenko 'The Avia-Pirate' - Steadying The Sinking Ship?
There was a leaked conversation where his top level Siloviki were discussing creating quasi-concentration camps 
for 'untrustworthy' opposition figures - after Protasevich's arrest, it no longer seems so unthinkable. Especially 
considering that Lukashenko is a long-time admirer of the Soviet Union and probably more knowledgeable than 
most about Stalin's methods. 
He'll probably be forced to make some concessions to Moscow. Could one such be recognition of Crimea, 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia? 
The probability of that is quite high; there has been a constant pressure on Lukashenko from the Kremlin to make 
that happen. Unlike with the West, Lukashenko is still wary of burning bridges with Ukraine, and to an extent, with 
Georgia. Minsk as a place for mediation, and Lukashenko himself as the middleman between warring countries - 
that's a chair he's most comfortable sitting on and will be very loath to part with. 
Additionally, Ukraine is one of Belarus' biggest economic partners, and if he were to go that route, he'd have to 
suffer the Kyiv sanctions, which will hurt him more than the Western-imposed sanctions do. Ukraine and Belarus 
share a one thousand km long border - alienating such a neighbor is not in Lukashenko's interests, and it's not the 
same as throwing vague threats at the proverbial West. Were it to happen, though, I doubt such recognition would 
carry much political weight internationally - if anything it would further cement Lukashenko's image as a dictator.

 The two leaders, at odds with the West over recent political maneuvers, have enjoyed a boat trip near Sochi. Last 
week, a plane was forced to land in Minsk to arrest a blogger critical of the Lukashenko regime.Russian President 
Vladimir Putin took Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko for a boat trip on Saturday as the pair met for a 
second day of talks amid outcry over Minsk's decision to force a plane to land last week, and arrest a dissident 
blogger. 
"Yesterday was the day of official talks and today it's informal," Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters 
about the meetings in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea. 
Putin and Lukashenko took advantage of "the fine weather" and went "on a boat trip," the spokesman continued. 
Saturday's talks had centered on economic cooperation and the coronavirus pandemic, according to Peskov. 
Common ground 
Putin was keen to show his longstanding ally support over the latest standoff with the West.  
Last Sunday, Minsk forced a Ryanair plane, which was en route to Lithuania, to land in the Belarusian capital, 
where authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a blogger critical of Lukashenko's government, and his 23-year-old 
girlfriend. 
The West has since decried the decision to force the jet to land.  
The United States on Friday announced punitive measures targeting the regime while Brussels urged EU-based 
carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
Putin and Lukashenko did not shy away from the events of last Sunday. 
"Lukashenko provided his counterpart detailed information about what happened on board the Ryanair aircraft," 
Peskov confirmed. 
The Kremlin was "not indifferent to the fate" of the detained blogger's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a Russian national, 
the spokesman added. 
Financial help 
Meanwhile, it was confirmed Russia will move ahead with a second installment of a $1.5 billion (€1.23 billion) loan 
to Belarus. 
Moscow gave Minsk the first $500 million last October, aimed at stabilizing its neighbor, with the second tranche set 
to be received before the end of June, both the RIA and Interfax news agencies reported.

 Belarusian authorities detained a journalist after grounding his Lithuania-bound flight. Belarus is facing sanctions 
from the European Union and the United States as a result. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin supported Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as he faces criticism for 
the arrest of Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old journalist and opposition activist. 
Belarusian authorities took Protasevich into custody after having his Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight grounded. [2] 
Lukashenko gave an "unequivocal order" to have the passenger plane ground in Minsk.  
In a call between the two leaders, Putin said the criticism of Minsk was "an outburst of emotions," according to a 
record of the call[3] released by the Kremlin.  
"We have things to discuss even without these events. I mean to say that in the first quarter of this year, our trade 
grew by a considerable 18.4 percent, and Russia remains a key trade and economic partner of Belarus. This is a 
good trend, and it is important to keep it going along with the Government's active work," Putin said.  
The support from Putin comes as the European Union agreed to impose sanctions on Belarus.[4] The sanctions 
include a ban on its airlines from using the airspace and airports of EU member states.  
The US also said it will re-impose full blocking sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises[5] and the 
Treasury Department said it will develop a new Executive Order for President Joe Biden to review that will give the 
US more power to impose sanctions on Lukashenko's regime. Read the original article on Business Insider[6]

May 29, 2021( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 WASHINGTON - The United States on Friday announced punitive measures against Belarus targeting the regime 
of strongman President Alexander Lukashenko, who met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amid a global outcry 
over the forced diversion of a European plane. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki called for "a credible international investigation into the events of May 23," 
which she called "a direct affront to international norms." 
Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrested 26-year-old opposition blogger and activist 
Roman Protasevich who was onboard, triggering a global outcry. 
The White House announced it was working with the European Union on a list of targeted sanctions against key 
members of Lukashenko's regime. 
Meanwhile, economic sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, reimposed by Washington in April 
following a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, will come into effect on June 3. 
Further U.S. moves on Belarus could target "those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks 
on democracy," Psaki said. 
The White House also issued a "Do Not Travel" warning for Belarus to U.S. citizens, and warned American 
passenger planes to "exercise extreme caution" if considering flying over Belarusian airspace. 
The European Union has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
However, President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted Lukashenko 
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. 
US Targets Belarus with Sanctions Amid Western Outcry Over Plane
With observers closely watching the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support the regime, the Russian 
leader said he was "very glad" to see Lukashenko and agreed with him the Western reaction was an "outburst of 
emotion." 
'Rock the boat' 
Lukashenko complained the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus. 
"An attempt is underway to rock the boat to reach the level of last August," he said, referring to anti-regime protests 
following a disputed election. 
"It's clear what these Western friends want from us." 
The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin "some documents" related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced. 
Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia. 
But after the Ryanair plane incident his options appear to be limited. 
Putin and the Belarus leader have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against 
Lukashenko's nearly three-decade rule. 
The 66-year-old waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on the Russian 
president amid condemnation from the West. 
Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison. 
Sunday's plane diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest Protasevich. 
Technical reasons 
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of air journeys between Russia and Europe, after Russian 
authorities rejected planes that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical," but they have raised concerns that Moscow could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
The Kremlin criticized the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous, with foreign ministry spokesperson 
Maria Zakharova calling it "completely irresponsible." 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but Moscow insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident. 
US Targets Belarus with Sanctions Amid Western Outcry Over Plane
Minsk said it demanded the flight land in the Belarus capital based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
Protasevich, who helped organize the demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along with 
Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in the city. 
'Braver' 
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday urged the EU to be "braver" and impose more 
sanctions against the Minsk regime. 
After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries did not go far enough. 
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that "it is time to change course." 
"No amount of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime," she said. 
The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a 3-billion-euro package to support "a 
democratic Belarus" if Lukashenko steps down.

 The new routes follow EU advice against using Belarusian airspace. On Sunday, the Minsk government sparked 
international outrage by forcing the landing of a Ryanair jet to arrest a dissident journalist.Air France and Lufthansa 
on Saturday said they have received approval from Russia for flight routes to the country that avoid Belarusian 
airspace. 
Air France, which operates one or two flights a day between Paris and Moscow, said its new flight path was put into 
operation on Saturday for this weekend. 
However, a spokesman said the French flag carrier was still awaiting confirmation that the new flight path can also 
be used from next week. 
"We ... are awaiting a green light from Russian authorities for our flights after this weekend," a spokesman said. 
 A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said it had been given approval for the new routes on its flights from Frankfurt to 
Moscow and St Petersburg for the foreseeable future. 
Belarus off limits 
Airlines have been scrambling to agree on new flight paths after EU leaders urged airlines not to use Belarusian 
airspace in the wake of the May 23 forced landing of a Ryanair jet by the Belarus government. 
The plane was grounded on the pretext of a bomb threat and a Belarusian MiG-29 fighter escorted the passenger 
jet to Minsk airport where dissident journalist, Raman Pratasevich, was arrested. 
European leaders have accused Belarus of state-sponsored piracy and also barred Belarusian carriers from the 
bloc's airspace, prompting cries of a "despicable" response by the head of the Belarusian national airline Belavia. 
In a post on his Facebook page on Saturday, Director Igor Tcherginets said such steps amounted to sanctions on 
the carrier, which he described as an innocent party in the affair. 
"All this is happening before an investigation of the incident, for which there may be some guilty parties, but Belavia 
is definitely not among them," he added. 
Belarus has faced international sanctions in the wake of the violent crackdown on the protest movement against 
strongman Alexander Lukashenko's rule. His opponents say his election win last August was fraudulent. 
Flights canceled over airspace guidance 
Russia approves Air France , Lufthansa routes avoiding Belarus
Earlier this week, Air France and Austrian Airlines had to cancel several flights to Moscow because they hadn't yet 
confirmed an alternative flight path with Russia. 
Moscow blamed the delay in issuing new permits on the sheer number of airlines requesting new routes. 
Meanwhile, the International Civil Aviation Organization is mulling an investigation into the forced landing amid 
claims Russia was involved.

 TOPICS OF THIS WEEK[1] 
The West should respond adequatly to Lukashenko's hijacking operation. 
The US waives sanctions on key players in Nord Stream 2 construction, while Anthony Blinken meets with Lavrov 
for the first time. The U.S. lawmakers respond with anger. 
Russian state media go on the offensive with the Ryanair incident, blame the West for 'double standards.' 
 Good Old Soviet Joke 
 One old bolsheviksays to another: 'No, my friend, we will not live long enough to see communism, but our children 
our poor children!' 
 Policy &#38; Research News 
Lukashenko, the Hijacker 
 The despicable arrest of the exiled opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega shocked, 
but not surprised, the world. The Belarus regimearrested[2]480 journalists only in 2020 and more than 35 000 
people have beenapprehended[3], but this case is, nevertheless, special. The Belarus authorities forced the 
Ryanair plane with 171 passengers and crew to land in Minsk due to the alleged suspicion of a bomb on board. 
Nothing indicates that the threat was real, the Ryanair CEO Michael O'Learydescribed[4]it as a state-sponsored 
hijacking. Most probably, there were KGB agents aboard. Protasevichtexted[5]his friend that he is being tailed by a 
Kremlin Watch Briefing: The West should respond to Lukashenko, the Hijacker
Russian-speaking man at the airport in Athens. In Minsk, four more people were deplaned which suggests that he 
was correct. 
Later, the video of Protasevich wasreleased[6]by state television Belarus 1. Belarusian activist acknowledged his 
role in the organization of mass protests after the presidential election, declared good health, and stated that he is 
being held in a pretrial detention facility in Minsk where everybody is treating him well. Protasevich is charged with 
terrorism and inciting mass riots. His alliesbelieve[7]that the statement was given under duress. Similarly, the 
international community does not believe in Belarus's innocence. The EU and the USA demand the prisoners be 
released. The EU statesagreed[8]on new economic sanctions on Lukashenko's regime and banned its state airlines 
from EU airspace and airports. The Council furtherappealed[9]to the members' airlines to avoid overflight of 
Belarus. The UKmirrored[10]the EU sanctions and similar steps weretaken[11]by Ukraine as well. 
And theanswer[12]of Belarus? New law forbidding journalists to inform about unallowed protests, ban on presenting 
results of opinion polls without approval, and stricter rules for organizing demonstrations. The legislature comes into 
force next month. Manifestly, Lukashenko demonstrates that he has no boundaries and the international 
community, led by the EU, has to react accordingly. Here are some suggestions:recognize[13]the airspace over 
Belarus as unsafe, forbid Belarussian aircraft at the EU airports, strong and well-targeted sanctions, support of 
Belarusian society and independent journalism,reconsideration[14]of Nord Steam 2, the expulsion of Belarus from 
Interpol, the expulsion of Belarus ambassadors and representatives of Belarusian KGB, and speedy investigation of 
the case with the clarification what role did Russia possibly play in it. 
 US waives sanctions on key players in Nord Stream 2 construction 
 On Wednesday, May 19th, the US Department of State waivedsanctions[15]placed upon the Nord Stream 2 
operator, Nord Stream 2 AG, andMatthias Warnig[16], the companies CEO and long-time associate of President 
Putin. 
A report detailing the planned waiver wasleaked[17]on the eve of a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken, and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov. The timing of the leak and nature of the waiver 
could suggest that the US is attempting to lay the groundwork for a morestable relationship[18]with Russia ahead of 
a proposedmeeting[19]between Biden and Putin. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskovstated[20]that the 
waiver was 'definitely a positive signal'. 
The move was also well received by German officials, who took the view that the waiver is a signal from the US that 
they are committed torebuilding ties[21]with Germany after thedamage[22]caused by the previous US 
administration. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maasstated[23], 'It's an expression of the fact that Germany is an 
important partner for the US'. Germany's unwavering support has led toaccusations[24]that they are prioritizing 
relations with Russia over EU unity and integrity. 
As expected, this reaction was in complete contrast to that of Ukraine. On May 21st, the Ukrainian parliament 
backed aresolution[25]calling on the US Congress to re-apply all sanctions in order to prevent the construction of 
Nord Stream 2. President Zelenskydeclared[26]that the completion of Nord Stream 2 would be a 'serious political 
victory' for the Kremlin, and the leader of the Holos Party, Kira Rudyk,added[27]that Nord Stream 2 is 'Russia's 
weapon in a hybrid war'. Further condemnation came from Poland, also a vociferous opponent of the project, with 
the government spokesman Piotr Mullerstating[28]'this information is definitely not positive from the security point of 
view'. This public criticism is particularly noteworthy, given how highly Poland values its cooperation and 
partnership with the United States. The formerLithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs[29]noted that the waiver 'is 
certainly a big win forKremlin[30]and big disappointment forUkraine[31]'. 
At the current rate of construction, the pipeline is likely to be completed before the end of 2021, with some analysts 
suggesting that this sanctions waiver willspeed up[32]the process.

 US Developments 
U.S. officials describe first Blinken-Lavrov meeting as 'productive' 
 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov,met[33]for the 
first time since President Biden took office. While U.S. officialsreported[34]that 'no substantive agreements were 
reached', they described the discussion as an 'open dialogue which could help to bridge the gap between the two 
countries.' Blinkenhighlighted[35]areas for cooperation between the two adversaries, such as fighting climate 
change and addressing the challenges posed by Covid-19: 'There are many areas where our interests intersect and 
overlap, and we believe that we can work together and, indeed, build on those interests.' 
This meeting comes at a moment when bilateral relations between the two nations are particularly tense. In March 
and April of this year, President Bidenissued[36]multiple rounds of stringent sanctions against Russia, responding 
to cyber attacks levied against the U.S., thetreatment[37]of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, renewed 
Russian aggression in Ukraine, and other malign actions. 
 U.S. lawmakers respond with anger to waived Nord Stream 2 sanctions 
 During his confirmation hearing, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinkenasserted[38]his commitment to do 
whatever he could 'to prevent the completion' of Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. This week's shocking digression 
from these previously stated aims was met with immediate anger from Members of Congress. 'Two months ago, 
President Biden called Putin a 'killer,' but today he's planning to give Putin, his regime, and his cronies massive 
strategic leverage in Europe,'declared[39]Republican Senator Ben Sasse. 
On Thursday, May 20, a group of Republican Senatorsintroduced[40]a bill that would reimpose the removed 
sanctions. Democratic lawmakers also expressed their displeasure with this decision. In a statement, Senate 
Foreign Relations ChairmanBob Menendez[41]highlighted[42]the discrepancy between the Biden administration's 
aforementioned goals and this recent action: 'The administration has said that the pipeline is a bad idea and that it 
is a Russian malign influence project. I share that sentiment, but fail to see how today's decision will advance U.S. 
efforts to counter Russian aggression in Europe.' 
This debate has emerged as a likely point of bipartisan cooperation between Republican and Democratic 
lawmakers in an otherwise highly polarized Congress. 
 Kremlin's Current Narrative 
Russian state media goes on the offensive with the Ryanair incident, blames the West for 'double standards' 
 The reaction of Russian state-funded media to the 'hijacking' of Ryanair flight has been more offensive than 
defensive. Immediately, themessaging[43]was formulated in a way to represent Roman Protasevich as 'an activist 
suspected of involvement in terrorist activities' working for an 'extremist outlet'.Riafan[44]quotes political scientist 
Sergei Markov and writes that'The scale of information that Protasevich can give out to the Belarusian authorities 
about Western sponsors is amazing and frightens the countries of the West'. 
All the articles confirm that the Ryanair plane had to land in Minsk 'due to a bomb threat' without allowing 
alternatives to be part of the discourse. Russian state media fails to mention anywhere that besides Roman 
Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, one more citizen of Belarus and three other citizens of Russia didn't 
continue their flight to Vilnius. 
RIA Novosti quotes the interview with the press secretary of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, Anatoly Glaz, 
whosaid[45]that the Ryanair incident is being'intentionally politicised with baseless accusations and labelling'.TASS 
Kremlin Watch Briefing: The West should respond to Lukashenko, the Hijacker
also activelypromoted[46]the comments of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Leonid 
Slutsky, as he blamed his Western counterparts for having 'double standards'. 
The same narrative was promoted by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova. In 
aninterview[47]withVesti FM radio station[48], she has labelled the Western reaction to the Ryanair incident 
as'nothing more than hysteria', adding that for the West,'Seizure through force was used to detain people and arrest 
them without a court ruling, only based on material planted by intelligence agencies and staged provocations.' 
She has additionally posted comments on Facebooksaying[49]that the West is 'following 'quod licet Iovi, non licet 
bovi' [What is permissible for Jupiter may not be permissible for a bull] principle'. All the major state media outlets, 
channelling her comments, constantly mention in reportingthat[50]'This is not the first time a plane was forced to 
land in Europe in an attempt to detain a wanted person'(referring to the cases of Edward Snowden &#38; an anti-
Maidan protester). 
Kremlin Watchis a strategic program of the European Values Center for Security Policy, which aims to expose and 
confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against the liberal-democratic 
system.

 Recent events could complicate the return of Euronews to Belarus. 
 As previously reported by Broadband TV News[1], the country's Ministry of Information excluded the channel in 
April on the grounds that its licence had expired. Furthermore, it was broadcasting adverts in English instead of 
translating them into Russian or Belarusian. 
 Perhaps not surprising, the move was criticised in a number of quarters, not least the European Commission. For 
its part, according to industry sources, Euronews decided in early May to reapply for a licence in accordance with 
local advertising rules. The sources add that the channel expected to hear back from the authorities by the 
beginning of June, though this was prior to the Ryanair incident and ensuing international outcry. 
 Euronews is currently expanding its presence across Central and Eastern Europe by entering into partnerships and 
launching localised versions of its service. In Serbia, for instance, it teamed up media group HD-WIN, part of 
Telekom Srbija, in July 2019 and earlier this year with University Politehnica of Bucharest (UPB) in Romania and 
Europa TV in Bulgaria. It also launched Euronews Georgia, which is owned by Silknet, in September last year. 
 Although it has been criticised in some quarters for its involvement with state-owned Telekom Srbija, Euronews 
remains widely respected throughout Europe for providing generally objective reporting at a time when press 
freedoms are increasingly coming under threat. Whether it receives a new licence to operate in Belarus remains to 
be seen, though it is likely to prove more difficult following the Ryanair incident. 
 In the meantime, we may well see more announcements of upcoming localised versions of Euronews in the CEE 
region.

May 28, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It was a clear act of state-sponsored terrorism. An Irish passenger plane from the Irish budget airline Ryan Air, 
while on its way from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in the Belarusian capital Minsk on May 23 only minutes 
before it was due to leave Belarus' airspace.  
 Flimsy claims by Belarusian air traffic controller that a bomb was on board quickly turned out to be a hoax cooked 
up by the dictatorial regime of the country's long time leader Alexander Lukashenko. In reality, Lukashenko wanted 
Belarusian journalist and opposition activist Roman Protasevic (Raman Pratasevich in Belarusian), who was on 
board the flight, to be forcibly brought to Minsk.  
 The Belarusian dictator, who has held on to power using brutal methods to quash pro-democracy protests after a 
fraudulent election in August 2020, wanted to arrest one of his main opponents. After he was arrested, together with 
his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, the 26-year-old reporter was forced to make a confession after being visibly 
tortured by the Belarusian KGB. 
Roman Protasevich, seen here in the video released by Belarusian authorities several hours after being arrested 
when his Ryanair flight was redirected to Minsk in an act of state-sponsored hijacking. WIKIPEDIA 
Protasevich has been in Lukashenko's crosshairs due to his position as editor-in-chief of the popular Telegram 
channels Nexta and Nexta Live, both of which are based in neighboring Poland and have an audience of almost 
two million. They served as a channel for the large-scale anti-Lukashenko protests after last year's rigged election 
gave Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, a sixth term in office. 
 Next and Nexta Live helped expose in real-time the scale of the secret police's crackdown on the hundreds of 
thousands of Belarusians across the country. Lukashenko countered by saying he would 'rather be killed' than hold 
fresh elections, and accused Protasevich of 'terrorism'. 
 Protasevich had been in Athens to cover a visit by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya[1], Belarus' leader-in-exile. Like many 
other Belarusian opposition members, Pratasevich had been forced into exile, in his case to Lithuania, he and his 
colleagues now face terrorism-related charges for exposing the Lukashenko regime's corruption and abuse of 
power. 
 In the wake of the incident, the leaders of the EU and US immediately condemned Lukashenko and demanded the 
release of Pratasevich. The West is united against the regime in Minsk and have decided to levy new sanctions 
against the Lukashenko regime. Belarus' national flag carrier Belavia has been banned from all flights to EU 
Tougher sanctions against Belarus
countries. All European airlines have also been ordered to fly around Belarus' airspace to deprive Lukashenko of 
highly lucrative overflight fees. Other Belarusian politicians and entrepreneurs who remain loyal to Lukashenko 
have been banned from entering the European Union and further, potentially crippling, economic sanctions are 
most likely to follow soon. They will most likely target potash exports, which is one of the main revenue generators 
for Belarus. 
 The influential chairman of the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, also urged the 
suspension of the controversial Nord Stream-II gas pipeline and the Yamal energy pipeline, both of which flow 
through Belarus and provide vast amounts of money that supports the 'tyrannous (Lukashenko) regime'.  
 The heads of foreign affairs from eight countries - the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
the UK and the US - have called for additional sanctions to be put in place against the Lukashenko regime, 
including the suspension of the country's right to use Interpol and other international organizations. 
 Lukashenko has declared that he 'will not remain silent and kneel down,' saying, 'I have acted lawfully by protecting 
the people according to all international rules.' He has also announced that he will announce counter-sanctions 
against European countries; a response that he claims is justified. 
 The extent to which Moscow knew about or colluded with the hijacking of the Ryanair flight remains an open 
question. Experts, including the renowned American historian Timothy Snyder, believe that the Kremlin most likely 
gave their tacit approval of the hijacking. 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko (L) and his close ally Russian President Vladimir Putin (R). 
Lukashenko, who for a while tried to free himself from Vladimir Putin's influence and position himself as a mediator 
in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine, now seems to have become a complete puppet of Putin. Only days after 
forcing the Ryanair jet to land in Minsk, he was in talks with Putin in Sochi to discuss the West's reaction to his act 
of terrorism. 
 Moscow's open pushback against the EU's sanctions on Belarus is also striking. EU airlines, such as Austrian 
Airlines and Air France, which wanted to fly to Moscow via the new route past Belarus, were refused landing 
permission by Russian authorities. 
 Western diplomats have said they will be tough on Lukashenko. If that is the case, airlines like Turkish Airlines and 
Aeroflot, both of which continue to fly to Minsk, should be punished with a ban on flying to Europe. 
 The EU, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and international journalist organizations have unanimously condemned 
Protasevich's arrest. The Association of European Journalists (AEJ) made several demands in a letter to Teresa 
Ribeiro the new media-freedom reprentative of the OSCE, of which Belarus is a member, to have Protasevich set 
free. 
 'We urge the Representative on Media Freedom, Mrs Ribeiro, to issue a full and robust statement without delay 
condemning the actions of the Belarus authorities over the unlawful detention and treatment of Roman Protasevich 
and Sofia Sapega; the denial of their legal rights and concerns about their mistreatment in custody; and demanding 
their immediate release and the Belarus authorities' unconditional adherence to its OSCE obligations by ending 
their arbitrary and brutal suppression of the rights and safety of journalists and others and restoring the conditions 
for democracy and the rule of law.' 
 AEJ-General Secretary Edward Steen added in a statement: 'Roman faces up to 15 years in prison, maybe worse. 
Is that a price he or any other journalists must pay for simply doing their jobs?' Given the worsening crackdown on 
media in Russia itself, and especially the silencing and imprisonment of Alexei Navalny[2], possible Russian secret 
service involvement in Belarus was 'more than troubling'.

 President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has threatened to retaliate for any European Union sanctions imposed 
on him for detaining two opposition activists after forcing their plane to land in Minsk earlier this week. 
Hours before a scheduled meeting in the Russian seaside resort of Sochi with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, 
his only major international ally, the Belarusian leader warned he would allow migrants and drugs to pour into 
western Europe. The 66-year-old said, 'We stopped drugs and migrants. Now you will eat them and catch them 
yourselves.' 
In a show of support for Lukashenko, Russia has been refusing permission for some European passenger jets to 
enter its airspace after airlines, following EU guidance, ordered their planes to alter their usual flight paths and 
bypass Belarus, depriving the Belarusian government of millions of dollars in flyover fees. 
Austria Thursday condemned Moscow's decision to cancel the Vienna-Moscow service as 'absolutely 
incomprehensible.' 
'It is in the interests of both Austria and Russia that all flights to and via Russia can continue to be carried out 
without any problems,' the Austrian foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Lukashenko also sought Thursday to play down the impact of any possible EU economic sanctions, saying, 'We'll 
substitute Europe, which is growing mercilessly old, for rapidly growing Asia.' 
He continued to maintain that Belarus diverted Sunday's Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight because of a bomb threat 
against the flight by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. 
 Belarus Opposition Leader Alleges Journalist from Diverted Plane Beaten in Detention 
 Opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich was arrested Sunday after a Belarussian fighter jet forced a passenger 
plane in which he was traveling to land in Minsk 
Belarus Threatens West as EU Debates Severe Sanctions
 The claim is dismissed by Hamas, and by Western governments, which say the forced landing of the Ryanair plane 
amounted to 'state-sponsored hijacking.' 
Opposition activists 26-year-old Roman Pratasevich, a blogger, and 23-year-old Sofia Sapega, a law student and 
Russian national, were taken from the plane and arrested when it landed in the Belarusian capital. Both are 
accused of a variety of offenses, including inciting rallies against Lukashenko in the wake of last August's 
presidential election, which was widely denounced by Western powers as rigged and fraudulent. 
European leaders have expressed outrage at the diversion of the Ryanair flight between two EU capitals and on 
Monday EU leaders discussed the incident at a summit, with European Council President Charles Michel saying in 
a statement the Belarus action 'will not remain without consequences.' During an informal meeting in Lisbon 
Thursday, EU foreign ministers planned the steps to take in addition to the ban on EU-based airlines using 
Belarusian airspace. 
The proposals being discussed focus on economic and sector-specific sanctions, EU officials told VOA. 
'We will continue to look at what consequences [sanctions] will have in Belarus, whether Lukashenko will give in. 
And if this is not the case, we have to assume that this will be only the beginning of a big and long spiral of 
sanctions,' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. 
Maas said sanctions must be made 'effective' by targeting business sectors that are important to Belarus' economy. 
He cited the potassium and phosphate sectors. 
'There is also the question to what extent Belarus should still be allowed to issue government bonds by the 
Belarusian state or by the Central Bank in Europe in the future,' he added. He said Lukashenko's behavior was 'so 
unacceptable,' the EU should not be satisfied with small steps. 
Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters Thursday, 'We could talk about [sanctions on] the 
oil production sector.' Foreign ministers of the G-7 countries have separately called for the 'immediate and 
unconditional release' of Protasevich and Sapega 'as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in 
Belarus.' 
'We will enhance our efforts, including through further sanctions as appropriate, to promote accountability for the 
actions of the Belarusian authorities,' the G-7 group said in a statement. 
There are splits among Western governments about how severe sanctions should be, though, with some arguing 
that a balance must be struck between punishing the Belarusian authorities while avoiding driving the country 
deeper into the arms of Putin, who Lukashenko is economically and militarily heavily reliant on.  
Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg has publicly advocated moderation, fearing deep and wide 
sanctions risk harming ordinary Belarusians without deterring Lukashenko. 
'We must also be careful that we do not hit people in Belarus,' he said. Estonia's foreign minister, Eva-Maria 
Liimets, appeared to echo those sentiments, telling reporters in Lisbon she hopes sanctions can be focused on 
'companies which are close to the Belarusian regime.' 
Some Western analysts say fears of driving Lukashenko further into the Russian fold are misplaced. The diversion 
of the Ryanair flight, said Keir Giles of Britain's Chatham House, 'could be no clearer statement that President 
Lukashenko has turned his back on the West and abandoned any restraint or concern for international censure.' 
'Four years ago,' he added, 'Belarus was still ostensibly nurturing a fragile form of independence, maintaining a 
degree of willfulness in its independent foreign policy from Russia, trying to quietly grow ties with the West while not 
Belarus Threatens West as EU Debates Severe Sanctions
alienating President Putin, and resisting Moscow's attempts to take over the military defense of Belarusian territory.' 
Now, however, Giles said he believes "Lukashenko has placed all his bets on Moscow and Russia.' 
Russian officials have backed Lukashenko but initially did so softly, possibly because, some Western diplomats 
suspect, the Kremlin was trying to take stock of what the implications could be for the just-agreed summit meeting 
next month between U.S. President Joe Biden and Putin, the first face-to-face encounter between the pair since 
Biden was elected president. 
 Biden, Putin Agree to June 16 Summit in Geneva 
 White House says it hopes US, Russia will 'restore predictability and stability' to their relationship 
 The editor-in-chief of state-controlled Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, said, at the start of the week, that 
Lukashenko 'played it beautifully,' but top Kremlin officials were less forthcoming initially, with Putin's spokesman 
declining press requests to comment, until Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov characterized Lukashenko's 
actions 'absolutely reasonable.' 
Lavrov called on other countries 'to soberly assess the situation.' 
Lukashenko's relationship with Putin has long been a fitful one, with the two frequently falling out. Lukashenko has 
relied on financial subsidies and oil supplies from Russia. A senior Russian diplomat based in Minsk once described 
to VOA a 'shouting match' he overheard during a phone conversation between them. The dispute was over the 
Belarusian leader's resistance to Putin's goal of closer integration between Russia and its onetime Soviet satellite, 
he said.  
Analysts say Putin's major Belarus objective is to ensure — much as his goal is with Ukraine — that it doesn't end 
up as a pro-Western enclave on Russia's borders. The Belarusian leader has long played the West against Russia 
and vice versa. He observed a neutral stance over Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. 
Western diplomats say it is irrelevant whether Russia is full-throated in backing Lukashenko or more vocally 
restrained. Either way Lukashenko has no one else to turn to now for support. They note since the August election, 
and the mass protests of his continued rule, he has been keener for closer cooperation between his military and 
Russia's. That has seen the establishment of joint military training centers and planning for a massive joint military 
exercise in September, known as Zapad-2021. Before departing Friday for Sochi, Lukashenko said he would be 
discussing with Putin restoring commercial air services between Russia and Belarus suspended because of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Kremlin officials said discussions would focus on forming closer economic ties between the 
two countries.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
Theillegitimate[2]president of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, is clinging to power, based on a lie that he won the 
presidential election in August 2020. This is the fundamental lie of his power. To prop up the lie, he has resorted to 
violence on several occasions. 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka is anillegal[3]president, but he controls the machineries of lies and violence in Belarus. The 
act of air-piracy against Ryanair FR4879 illustrates both. In order to extort violence against a dissident journalist, he 
deploys a lie about a bomb threat, and supports that lie with a threat of military violence, sending a fighter jet to 
intercept the passenger aircraft. 
 Military Violence 
 The conversation between the air traffic control and the flight crew was deliberately doctored in news reports. 
TheBelarusian state broadcaster attempted to show[4]that the decision to land in Minsk, despite Vilnius being 
closer, was taken by the flight crew: 
A portion of the conversation between an air traffic controller and Boeing pilots leaves no ambiguity: the pilot clearly 
lets the other side know that the initiative to land in Belarus belongs to the crew. This is the crew's decision: to 
make a turn and to land at Minsk International Airport minutes later. The reason is a message about a bomb placed 
onboard the plane. 
This statement is false. The full transcript,published the next day[5], shows that Minsk air traffic control instructed 
the pilots to divert to Minsk: 
Lies, Damned Lies And Lukashenka's Lies
Pilot: OK, I give you (unreadable) can you say again the IATA code of the airport that authorities have 
recommended us to divert to? 
ATC: RYR 1TZ Standby. 
Pilot: Standby, roger. 
ATC: 09:41:00: RYR 1TZ. 
Pilot: Go ahead. 
ATC: IATA code is MSQ. 
Pilot: can you say again please? 
ATC: IATA code MSQ. 
Pilot: MSQ, thanks. 
Pilot: 09:41:58: RYR 1TZ Again, this recommendation to divert to Minsk, where did it come from? Where did it come 
from? Company? Did it come from departure airport authorities or arrival airport authorities? 
ATC: RYR 1TZ this is our recommendations. 
Pilot: can you say again? 
ATC: RYR 1TZ this is our recommendations. 
In a passionate speech Wednesday 26 May,Mr Lukashenka emphasised[6]that he was responsible for all actions 
taken in order to divert the aircraft, as the bomb threat was serious. 
Research produced by The Daily Beast[7]and The Dossier Center has obtained the original bomb threat e-mail, 
allegedly sent from Hamas to the airport authorities. And the letter was sent 24 minutesafterthe order to divert the 
airport. The lie about the bomb threat is not only a lie, it is a crude lie. 
 Civilian Lies 
 While theillegitimate[8]president Lukashenka is lying, his minions focus on the applied violence. The state-run 
news agency of Belarus has distributed videos, in which the detained Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega 
'confess to their crimes'. This is a practice used by terrorist groups and rogue states. 
Violence and lies are intimately connected. Nobel Prize laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyndescribes in an essay[9]the 
connection between the noisy violence and the poisonous lies: 
When violence bursts onto the peaceful human condition, its face is flush with self-assurance, it displays on its 
banner and proclaims: 'I am Violence! Make way, step aside, I will crush you!' But violence ages swiftly, a few years 
pass—and it is no longer sure of itself. To prop itself up, to appear decent, it will without fail call forth its ally—Lies. 
For violence has nothing to cover itself with but lies, and lies can only persist through violence. 
Lies, Damned Lies And Lukashenka's Lies
On 21 May this year, the opposition activist Vitold Ashurakdied from head wounds[10]in prison. In November 2020, 
the opposition activist Raman Bandarenka died after police violence in Minsk. In February 2021, theUN Special 
Rapporteur on human rights in Belarus[11], Anas Marin, reported thousands of cases of torture, intimidation and 
threats against activists, human rights defenders and journalists. Ms Marin concludes her report: 
The unprecedented scale of human rights violations, the ultimate impunity in which they are being perpetrated, and 
the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation - all of these should compel the international community 
not only to continue its close scrutiny of the human rights situation in Belarus, but also to further consolidate its 
efforts to change the trends I just mentioned. The Belarusian people are eager to see these changes, and these 
efforts too. 
The Belarusian human rights organisation,Viasna,[12]reports that Lukashenka's regime currently holds 421 political 
prisoners. Belarus is one of the 51 founding members of the United Nations. The country is being held hostage by 
Lukashenka, who is denying Belarusians the fundamental freedoms of the UN Charter.

 Belarus diverted a Ryanair flight on Sunday, and arrested an outspoken dissident who was on board. Belarus 
claimed it received a bomb threat via email from Hamas and informed the pilots. But the email was sent 24 minutes 
after Belarus alerted pilots of the supposed threat, per The Daily Beast[1]. See more stories on Insider's business 
page[2]. 
The supposed bomb threat that Belarus used to justify diverting a plane to arrest a journalist[3] was sent 24 minutes 
after Minsk first alerted the pilots, The Daily Beast reported[4]. 
On Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, was forced to land in Minsk. When it 
landed, Belarusian authorities boarded the plane and arrested the dissident Roman Protasevich[5], who was on 
board. 
Protasevich is one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics and is accused of terrorism 
and inciting anti-government riots[6].  
Belarus said Monday that it had diverted the plane due to a bomb threat from the Hamas militant group[7].  
The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that the bomb threat, which came as an email, was received by Minsk 
National Airport's general information account at 12:57 p.m. on Sunday. 
But the plane was first alerted to the threat at 12:33 p.m., the outlet said, 24 minutes before. 
According to The Daily Beast, the email - which bore the subject line "Allahu Akbar" (Arabic for "God is great") - 
said: 
"We, Hamas soldiers demand that Israel cease fire in the Gaza Strip. We demand that the European Union 
abandon its support for Israel in this war. We know that the participants of Delphi Economic Forum are returning 
home on May 23 via flight FR4978. A bomb has been planted onto this aircraft. If you don't meet our demands the 
bomb will explode on May 23 over Vilnius." 
The Daily Beast noted that a further inconsistency exists as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas had already 
been agreed two days before[8] the email was sent. 
Hamas has denied[9] involvement in the Ryanair interception. 
The bomb threat that Belarus cited to divert the Ryanair plane was sent 24 minutes after the pilots were first 
told it existed, report says
On Monday, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, told Ireland's "Newstalk Breakfast"[10] radio show that the incident 
was "a case of state-sponsored hijacking" in which "the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist." 
The hijacking has been widely denounced by top officials in the US[11], UK[12], and the EU[13]. Only Russia is 
standing by Belarus, leading some experts to suggest that Moscow - on which Belarus heavily relies on for support 
- was either involved or supportive of the hijacking.[14] 
Russia denies involvement. 
Protasevich is still in custody and, on Monday, the Belarusian government released a video in which he confessed 
to planning protests[15] in Minsk. 
However, his father, Dzmitry Protasevich, told Sky News[16] the confession looked forced and that his nose 
appeared to be broken. Read the original article on Business Insider[17]

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
The pro-Kremlin ecosystem has established its talking points on Lukashenka's act of, in the words of the CEO of 
Ryanair, 'state-sponsored piracy[2]'. All the Kremlin-controlled media outlets repeat the same two mantras: 
'Everybody does it[3]!' and 'Pratasevich is a Bad Guy[4]'. 
The first claim is not only entirely irrelevant, but also factually wrong. Lukashenka is the only leader of state, albeit 
in this case illegitimate, that has ordered fighter jets to force a civilian aircraft to land in order to detain a political 
opponent. The second claim - on dissident Raman Pratasevich being an 'Extremist' - is both unfounded and 
irrelevant to the case. It doesnotjustify Lukashenka's decision to use military threat against a civilian aircraft. 
Moscow-based Strategic Culture Foundation does, while attempting to defend Lukashenka, actually support the 
notion that the illegitimate president acted illegally[5]: 
Admittedly, what took place in Belarusian airspace was irregular and possibly illegal. 
Still, the outlet attempts to put the blame on European leaders, 'refusing to hand over Pratasevich and thus,forcing 
Lukashenka to[6]make the controversial move'. And generally,Everybody does it![7] 
Other outletsattempt to defame Mr Pratasevich[8]himself. This is, again, entirely irrelevant to the case of 
Lukashenka's military threats towards a civilian aircraft. The claims follow a line of describing any form of dissent 
asFascism or Nazism[9]. 
Deny, Deceive, Defame And Deflect
And of course, we have the traditional 'deny everything' line of defence. Threatening civilian aircraft with fighter jets 
is'in strict alignment with international regulation[10]s'. No, it is not. Issuing a false bomb threat against a civilian 
airline is not the standard procedure for apprehending a wanted criminal. This is just a plain lie. 
A couple of words have to be said about the Belarusian authorities' claim thatthe terrorist organisation Hamas 
forwarded the bomb threat[11]against the Ryanair flight. This is actuallyMike and Nick level amateurism[12]from the 
Lukashenka regime. Belarusian transport authorities claimed Hamas forwarded a demand that the EU put pressure 
on Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza. Why Hamas would contact Minsk about this, and why they would demand a 
ceasefire several days after their victory parades in Gaza, remains a mystery. Senior Hamas leadershave denied 
the claims[13]; putting Minsk in the awkward situation of being perceived less trustworthy than an internationally 
condemned terrorist organisation. 
There seems to be a general rule for pro-Kremlin media contributors: 'When in doubt - blame Ukraine'. The Kremlin 
itself did not hurry in issuing comments on the Ryanair FR4879 incident, leaving the writers without guidance on 
lines to take. One outlet could not wait for Moscow's instructions and simply did what had to be done: blamed 
everything on Ukraine.The detention was a set-up by the Ukrainian Security Services![14] 
When it comes to numbers, disinformation on Ukraine dominates this week: just under 20 cases are devoted to 
various attempts to attack Ukraine: several follow very old tropes, 'Ukraine is a Nazi state[15]', 'Ukraine is 
undemocratic[16]',Ukraine is aggressive and under US control[17]', 'Ukraine is not a sovereign state[18]' All well-
worn, comfortable cases of disinformation. Currently there are4,400 cases on Ukraine[19]in the database. That is 
almost a third of the total number of cases collected since 2015. 
We see a conscious approach played out by the Kremlin:occupy the information space[20]. The method has been 
carefully presented inRussian security studies[21]' journals: 
A preventively shaped narrative, answering to the national interests of the state, can significantly diminish the 
impact of foreign forces' activities in the information sphere, as they, as a rule, attempt to occupy 'voids' [in the 
information flow]. 
Whataboutism[22]andbullshitting[23]- the pro-Kremlin media is shaping the narratives and avoiding the core issues.

While asking for help from the EU and US, they also said their son has been tortured while in custody. 
Roman Protasevich, one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics, was detained on May 
23 after being removed from a Ryanair flight and accused of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots[2].

Belarus : EU ministers begin talks on fresh sanctions

 Germany says EU foreign ministers won't be satisifed with "small steps" as they put together plans for economic 
and sector-specific sanctions.EU foreign ministers are discussing a new round of economic and sector-specific 
sanctions for Belarus, during informal talks on Thursday in the Portuguese city of Lisbon. 
This comes just days after EU leaders agreed to impose serious aviation restrictions, in response to a forced 
landing of a passenger plane by Belarus authorities. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell decried"the hijacking of the plane and the detention of the two passengers" as 
"completely unacceptable," shortly ahead of the meeting. 
He tweeted he was looking forward to discussions. 
What might the new sanctions be? 
Borrell said that the EU foreign ministers would be discussing sanctions against specific people connected to the 
Belarusian regime. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that he expected to see significant sanctions. If Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko does not make concessions, "one must assume that this will be just the beginning of a large 
and long spiral of sanctions," Maas said ahead of the meeting. 
He described Lukashenko's behavior as "so unacceptable" that the EU would not be satisfied with smaller 
sanctions steps. 
Instead, the goal is "that we want to impose sanctions on the economic structure and on financial transactions in 
Belarus quite significantly so that it also has an impact. 
As they headed into the meeting, Baltic state ministers from Estonia and Lithuania speculated about possible 
sectors that the EU could target with sanctions. 
Lithuania Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters: "We could talk about [sanctions on] the oil 
production sector." 
Meanwhile, Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets told reporters that she was hoping to discuss sanctions on 
"the companies which are close to the Belarusian regime." 
Sector-specific sanctions could 'really hurt' Belarus 
DW's Senior European Correspondent Bernd Riegert explained that despite the far-reaching sanctions on flights, 
these were "not the biggest measures" that the EU will take against Belarus. 
Belarus : EU ministers begin talks on fresh sanctions
He said that the "sectoral sanctions" being discussed on Thursday could "really hurt Belarus." He suggested the EU 
could target the country's wood or cement industry. 
He stressed that "the EU is not there yet," adding that "not all foreign ministers are sure this is the right path." 
What's the row with Belarus? 
On Sunday, authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. 
They scrambled a fighter jet to ensure that the passenger plane, which was flying from Athens in Greece to Vilnius 
in Lithuania, would land. 
Authorities arrested 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, an exiled Belarusian dissident and bloggerin Belarus who was 
on board. He had left the country in 2019, shortly before pro-democracy protests swept the country that has been 
dubbed "Europe's last dictatorship." 
The EU said it "strongly condemns" the arrest and forced landing, adding that it endangered aviation safety. 
They requested EU carriers to refrain from flying over Belarusian airspace. 
EU leaders also decided to ban Belarusian carriers from flying over the bloc's airspace. 
What else is on the agenda? 
The EU's foreign ministers are also set to discuss its strategy in Africa. This comes days after Mali's interim 
president and prime minister resigned on Wednesday after they were arrested in an "attempted coup." 
 Several EU countries have troops in the country as part of efforts to shore up a deteriorating security situation in 
the Sahel region. 
They will also talk about what the EU council termed "unresolved conflicts in the Eastern neighborhood" — likely 
also to mean Ukraine, in addition to Belarus. 
In April, there was growing concern in Western Europe over the amassing of around 100,000 Russian troops along 
its border with Ukraine and in the Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Ministers are also set to tackle tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. There has been increasing tension in the 
contested South China sea region between the US and China.

 The Austrian Airlines flight wanted to change its route to avoid Belarus, but Russia rejected this, the airline said. 
Meanwhile, Belarusian national airline Belavia canceled flights to eight countries.Austrian Airlines said it canceled a 
cargo-passenger flight from Vienna to Moscow on Thursday.  
Flight OS601 from Vienna was scheduled to arrive in Moscow on time, but the board at Domodedovo airport listed 
the flight as canceled. Earlier, the airline had refused to transit through Belarusian airspace on the way to Moscow. 
The European Union has urged its airlines to avoid Belarus and its airspace following Sunday's forced landing in 
Minsk of a Ryanair plane and the arrest of dissident journalist Roman Pratasevich.  
A representative of Austrian Airlines told the Interfax news agency that the new flight route needed to be confirmed 
with the authorities. 
"The Russian authorities have not given us this permission," the spokeswoman was quoted as saying in the 
Russian-language report. 
"The Russian reaction is absolutely incomprehensible to us," Austria's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on the 
matter, calling it a disproportionate response.  
"The Austrian Foreign Ministry communicated this to the Russian ambassador today. The Austrian ambassador in 
Moscow also presented this position to Russia," it said, calling on Moscow to clarify its position and adding that all 
flights over and to Russia should be able to continue without problems. 
Earlier, AirFrance also reported canceled flights to the Russian capital.  
EU foreign ministers mull sanctions 
Also on Thursday, EU foreign ministers in Lisbon vowed to continue to increase pressure on Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven called for the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Pratasevich.  
"We demand the immediate and unconditional release" of Pratasevich, "as well as all other journalists and political 
prisoners held in Belarus," the ministers said in a joint statement published by the British government. 
The parents of detained journalist Pratasevich also urged the international community to help free their son. 
"I want you to hear my cry, the cry of my soul. So that you understand how difficult it is for us now and how much 
we are experiencing this situation,'' Natalia Pratasevich, the reporter's mother, said at a news conference in Poland. 
"I am begging you, help me free my son.'' 
Russia prohibits Austrian Airlines flight to arrive without entering Belarusian airspace: reports
Kremlin is 'not in charge of controlling air traffic' 
Meanwhile, Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov sidestepped the question of canceling flights 
by European air carriers.  
"The presidential administration is not in charge of controlling air traffic. We recommend you to address this 
question to our aviation authorities," Peskov told journalists, Interfax quoted him as saying. 
Belavia cancels international flights 
Belarusian national carrier Belavia meanwhile cancelled flights to eight countries on Thursday. Belavia announced 
the cancellations "due to flight bans from a number of countries," after neighboring Poland joined a growing list of 
territories that have barred its overflights.  
"We regret that our passengers have to face this situation for reasons beyond the airline's control," Belavia said as 
it scrapped flights to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hanover, Kaliningrad, Milan, Munich, 
Rome, Vienna and Warsaw until Oct. 30. 
This is a breaking news story and will be updated as events unfold.

May 26, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian authorities detained a 26-year-old journalist after grounding his Lithuania-bound flight. Roman 
Protasevich is a vocal critic of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Protasevich's activism against his 
country's tyranny dates back to 2011, when he was 16 years old. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The dramatic arrest of Belarusian dissident Roman Protasevich drew international interest this week, when 
Belarusian authorities took the 26-year-old journalist into custody after grounding his Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight. 
Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega[2], were aboard flight FR4978 from Athens to Lithuania before pilots 
were alerted of a bogus security threat and ordered to land in Minsk. Belarusian state media reported it was 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko[3] who gave an "unequivocal order" to ground the passenger jet in 
Minsk. 
Belarusian KGB agents[4] took Protasevich, a vocal critic of Lukashenko, into custody after the flight landed in 
Minsk, despite data on Flightradar24[5] showing the plane made a sharp U-turn to land in Belarus, as it was closer 
to its destination in Lithuania than Minsk, Insider's Cheryl Teh[6] reported. 
Just before Belarusian authorities arrested Protasevich, one passenger aboard the plane - solely identified as 
Mantas - told Reuters[7] they saw him give a laptop and phone to a female passenger who was traveling with him. It 
was not immediately clear if that female passenger was Sapega, who was also detained[8] after the flight was 
grounded in Minsk and could face charges[9] in Belarus. 
Protasevich grew up in Minsk, and has been an opponent of Lukashenko's regime for a decade, first demonstrating 
his opposition to the Belarusian government in a 2011 video[10] posted to YouTube. Protasevich, then 16 years old, 
was among those detained by state authorities after sitting on a bench watching a "clapping protest" - in which a 
flash mob clapped in protest of the government but never audibly expressing their grievances, according to a report 
by The New York Times[11]. 
"For the first time I saw all the dirt that is happening in our country," he said in the video, citing The Times report. 
"Just as an example: Five huge OMON riot police officers beat women. A mother with her child was thrown into a 
police van. It was disgusting. After that everything changed fundamentally."

authorities after his plane was forced to land
Protasevich's mother told The Times that, soon after, her son's school expelled him. He was homeschooled for six 
months because no other schools would take him. 
"Imagine being a 16-year-old and being expelled from school," Protasevich's mother told The Times, citing the 2011 
incident - which she described as an "injustice" and an "insult" - as the reason he was so entrenched in opposition 
activism. "That is how he began his activism as a 16-year-old."

Protasevich went on to study journalism at Belarusian State University but ran into legal trouble and was unable to 
finish his degree, The Times reported. 
He was frequently detained and jailed as he worked freelance for opposition-focused news outlets, before he 
decided to move to Poland and work on leaking videos and documents related to the Lukashenko regime. He 
cofounded and serves as the editor-in-chief of Nexta, a news outlet based in Poland[13] reporting on opposition 
efforts against Lukashenko, for the next 10 months. 
In 2019, he moved back to Minsk until authorities arrested another opposition journalist Vladimir Chudentsov, 
prompting Protasevich to once again flee to Poland with his parents, who were also under government scrutiny. 
Amid the controversial 2020 presidential election in Belarus, Protasevich took a step further in his "activist 
journalism" and began to cross into the realm of political activism - not only reporting on protests against 
Lukashenko's regime but also organizing them. 
Stispan Putsila, a fellow dissident who worked alongside Protasevich at Nexta, told The Times Protasevich became 
"more interested in organizing street action" following the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, in which allegations 
of a rigged election spurred nationwide protests after Lukashenko won a sixth term by a landslide. 
The European Union also imposed sanctions on several Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko, in the wake of 
the contested presidential elections in August. 
"I would not say he was more radical, but he definitely became more resolute," Putsila said of Protasevich's 
emerging activism in light of the elections. 
In an interview[14] with The Times last year, Protasevich said "we're journalists, but we also have to do something 
else." 
"No one else is left," he continued. "The opposition leaders are in prison." 
In a government video reposted by the Minsk reporter Hanna Liubakova[15] following his arrest earlier this week, 
Protasevich confirmed he was detained by authorities at Minsk National Airport by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
He said he's had "no health concerns" and was treated "correctly" and "lawfully" when taken into custody. 
Protasevich said he was cooperating with authorities and continued to "provide evidence related to the mass rallies 
in Minsk," according to a translation by Insider. 
The Times reported his friends said he made the aforementioned confession under duress as he was in custody at 
the Minsk National Airport. On the contrary, Putsila told The Times Protasevich's character "has always been very 
resolute" and that he "refused to live in fear." 
"The Lukashenko regime considers Roman one of its main enemies," Putsila told The Times. "Maybe it is right."

 The Belarusian leader said "ill-wishers" are "trying to strangle Belarus" in his first speech since a commercial flight 
was intercepted and a critical blogger arrested.Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hit out at Western powers 
on Wednesday, saying that his country's "ill-wishers" are "trying to strangle Belarus." 
It's the first time Lukashenko has spoken in public since a Ryanair plane was diverted over the weekend and 
dissident blogger Raman Pratasevich and law student Sofia Sapega were taken into custody. 
What did Lukashenko say? 
In his speech, Lukashenko said that "attacks" on Belarus have crossed "red lines." 
"As we predicted, our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state. They have 
crossed many red lines and crossed boundaries of common sense and human morality," Lukashenko said as he 
addressed members of parliament, the Belta state-run news agency reported. 
He also said that a bomb threat, which Belarusian authorities said was behind the plane's landing in Minsk, came 
from Switzerland, and that outside forces were waging a "hybrid war" against the country. 
Lukashenko additionally called it an "absolute lie" that a fighter jet forced the plane to land, and said Belarus had 
acted "lawfully, to protect people." 
"I acted lawfully to protect our people," he said, also accusing Pratasevich of planning to start a "bloody rebellion." 
What happened with the flight? 
On Sunday, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair plane to land as it was flying to Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. 
Upon landing in Minsk, authorities and took blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, into 
custody. 
Prior to his arrest, Pratasevich — a vocal critic of Lukashenko — was traveling from Greece to Lithuania. 
Minsk ordered the commercial plane flying over its airspace to land, claiming a bomb was onboard — an 
explanation German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called "completely implausible." 
The EU responded by slapping sanctions on Belarus, including a ban on Belarusian airlines using EU airspace or 
airports. 
Following Lukashenko's comments on Wednesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was 
advising EU airlines, as well as non-EU carriers flying to or from the bloc, to avoid airspace above Belarus.  
"The circumstances surrounding this action cast serious doubts on the respect shown by Belarus for international 
civil aviation rules," the EASA said in a safety bulletin. 
Belarus : Lukashenko slams Western response to forced plane diversion
"The actions undertaken by Belarus amounted to an increased safety risk for the [Ryanair] flight and put into 
question the ability of Belarus to provide safe air navigation services." 
Opposition announces new protests 
Meanwhile, the Belarusian opposition it is preparing to stage a new phase of active anti-government protests in 
Belarus, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said. 
Mass protests erupted against President Alexander Lukashenko last summer after he declared victory in a 
presidential election that his opponents said was rigged. The protests slowed down after a sweeping crackdown 
implemented by authorities.  
"There's nothing more to wait for, we have to stop the terror once and for all," Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement 
on social media.

 The parents of the young opposition activist and blogger detained in Minsk after the passenger jet he was on board 
was forced to land in the Belarusian capital earlier this week are pleading for the international community to help 
free their son. 
'I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,' Raman Pratasevich's 
mother, Natalia, told AFP. Speaking from her home in Poland, she added, 'Please save him. They're going to kill 
him there.' 
'They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism — I don't think you can call it anything else. 
He's been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!' she said. 
Her husband, Dmitry Pratasevich, a former soldier, said: 'His lawyer tried to see him today but she was turned 
down. She could not see him. We still don't know if he is in there, what his condition is, how he is feeling.' 
Their anguish was matched by the mother of Sofia Sapega, another opposition activist, who was also removed from 
the Ryanair flight in Minsk. A video of Sapega, a Russian national and friend of Pratasevich, was released Tuesday 
by Belarusian authorities as they announced she would be held for at least two months.

05/reu_sapega.JPG?itok=jqpjWYDi FILE - Student Sofia Sapega is pictured in Gothenburg, Sweden, in this 
undated photo taken in 2019. In the video, Sapega, according to her mother, appears to be confessing to editing an 
opposition Telegram channel that publishes personal information of Belarusian policemen. Her mother said it 
appeared she was speaking under duress for the video, in which she provides her personal details and says she 
edited a platform 'which publishes the personal information of officials from internal affairs bodies.' 
Sofia's mother, Anna Dudich, told Russian television she was 'shocked' by the video. 'Either I'm confused, or it's a 
dream, or it's a setup,' Dudich said. She told Western media outlets that her daughter was talking in an unusual 
Parents Plea For Release of Belarus Opposition Activists
manner. 'She sways, eyes in the sky — as if afraid of forgetting something.' Dudich added: 'We are now packing 
warm clothes. We will go to Minsk. I want to try to give her a parcel. I saw she only had a thin jacket.' 
Sapega and Pratasevich were detained Sunday when the Ryanair plane they were flying on from Athens to Vilnius 
was diverted by Belarus authorities to land in Minsk. Western countries, including the United States, have accused 
Belarus of committing air piracy and hijacking the Ryanair plane after it was rerouted over a false bomb threat.

intercepted and diverted to Minsk by Belarus authorities lands at Vilnius International Airport, its initial destination, in 
Lithuania, May 23, 2021. Sapega's lawyer, Alexander Filanovich, told RBC, a Russian news outlet, that Sapega 
was interrogated Tuesday and charged with criminal offenses. Russian foreign ministry officials say she's being 
charged with 'committing crimes under several articles of the Criminal Code of Belarus during the period from 
August to September 2020.' That was during the height of nationwide protests against the fifth re-election of 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
The Belarusian opposition and Western nations have condemned the election as rigged. 
Sapega's mother said her daughter was in Lithuania at the time and wasn't involved in the demonstrations in 
Belarus. Sapega, who is also a student at the European Humanities University, EHU, in Lithuania, and Pratasevich, 
26, face stiff penalties if convicted. Pratasevich, whom Belarusian authorities have placed on a terrorism list on the 
ground that he incited mass protests, could be handed a death sentence, opposition groups fear. Some analysts 
say a 15-year prison term is more likely. 
Torture 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told a news conference Tuesday that a video of 
Pratasevich released by Belarusian authorities suggested he had been tortured. 'He said that he was treated 
lawfully, but he's clearly beaten and under pressure. There is no doubt that he was tortured. He was taken hostage,' 
she told reporters in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.

are being held in the Okrestina pre-trial detention center in Minsk, where thousands of anti-Lukashenko protesters 
and activists have been detained the past few months. Belarusian and international rights groups, including 
Amnesty International, say many detainees arrested for protesting are beaten and tortured in the center, which is 
overseen by the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Belarus, part of the country's interior ministry. 
Rights groups have documented three rapes. And in October 2020, opposition groups released a video purportedly 
showing fresh detainees being beaten in so-called 'welcome parades.' 
At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, leaders of the 27 European Union member states called for all EU-based 
airlines to cease all flights over Belarus, and they promised further economic sanctions. 
Ukraine's response 
Separately, Belarusian neighbor Ukraine has suspended all air travel with Belarus, and the country's prime minister, 
Denys Shmygal, has ordered all Ukrainian airlines to avoid flying in Belarusian airspace, which will add, according 
to Ukrainian Airlines, 40 minutes to flights from Kyiv heading to the Baltic states and Finland. 
Parents Plea For Release of Belarus Opposition Activists
"Belarusian authorities stop at nothing in persecuting dissenters. Even its airspace is unsafe now,' Ukraine's 
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. 'Ukraine has always been interested in a democratic Belarus where 
human rights are respected.' 
The EU and Ukraine air bans will result in a loss to Belarus of about $70 million in overflight fees, civil aviation 
associations reckon.

 One of Sofia Sapega's biggest concerns might have been defending her thesis, then the flight she and her 
boyfriend, Raman Pratasevich, were on was forced to the ground in Belarus. Now she has many other worries.After 
a two-week vacation in Greece, 23-year-old Sofia Sapega was returning to her university studies in the Lithuanian 
capital, Vilnius, on Sunday. But plans to defend her master's thesis were put on hold after Belarus falsely claimed 
there was a bomb on her Ryanair flight, forced the plane to land in Minsk and took her into custody.  
She was traveling with her boyfriend, Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian blogger and prominent critic of authoritarian 
leader Alexander Lukashenko. As soon as the plane was diverted to Minsk, Pratasevich realized he would be 
arrested and handed Sapega his laptop and phone, a passenger on the flight told Reuters news agency. But 
Belarusian authorities detained her, saying she will be held in pre-trial detention for two months. 
Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta reported Sapega, a Russian citizen, could face charges of plotting riots and 
organizing an action that violates public order. The Russian Foreign Ministry has promised to offer her consular 
services.  
Sapega under 'psychological pressure' 
On Tuesday, Sapega appeared in a video, saying she was a publisher of a Telegram channel that illegally 
disclosed the private information of officers in the Belarusian Interior Ministry. 
Sapega is well and has not complained of inappropriate treatment, the RIA news agency reported, citing the 
Russian Embassy to Belarus. 
But the Belarusian opposition members said the recording, which shows Sapega talking fast and making little eye 
contact with the camera, was coerced and possibly made under duress. They also said Pratasevich's alleged 
confessional video, in which he has dark marks on his forehead, was forced. 
"Clearly, Raman is beaten in prison," exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. "He and Sofia are 
under psychological pressure." 
Sapega's mother, Anna Dudich, said there was no reason for her daughter's arrest. 
"My hopes are now probably based on a miracle and on the knowledge that my daughter is definitely not guilty of 
anything," she told Reuters from Lida in Belarus. "She simply showed up in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
Dudich said she worries about her daughter's safety and health in Belarusian detention. The last time she heard 
from Sapega was in the form of a text when the plane was forced to land in Minsk. 
It only read "Mama." 
EU leaders call for immediate release 
Who is Sofia Sapega, girlfriend of Belarusian blogger Raman Pratasevich?
The arrest of Pratasevich and Sapega caused international outrage. EU leaders have called the plane diversion a 
"hijacking" and "state piracy" and are demanding the immediate release of the detained couple.  
On Monday, they announced additional economic sanctions on individuals involved in the flight diversion as well as 
businesses supporting Lukashenko's regime. The EU has progressively been restricting key political figures in 
Belarus since October 2020 as a response to the government crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
This time around, the 27-nation bloc also prohibited Belarusian airlines from flying in EU airspace or landing at EU 
airports. Some European carriers like Lufthansa and KLM have stopped flying to Belarus. 
"Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have severe consequences," European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen said.

 Family and friends of Russian citizenSofia Sapega - who was detained alongside her boyfriend Roman Protasevich 
on the Ryanair flight which was forcibly diverted to Minsk on Sunday - are saying she was simply in the wrong place 
at the wrong time.  
 Since the pair'sarrests, Western powers have condemned what they called an act of "state piracy" and a "hijacking" 
of an airliner, with the EU ready to heap more sanctions on the Lukashenko government and with European flights 
now avoiding Belarusian airspace altogether over safety concerns. The whole bizarre episode appears to be 
leading toward another major diplomatic "Navalny-styleshowdown" between the West and Russia and its allies, 
given especially Putin's vocal support for embattled Lukashenko over the past months since the disputed election.  
 According to Reuters[3], "Sapega is a student at a university in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. She was flying there 
on Sunday with Protasevich after their holiday in Greece to defend her master's thesis ahead of graduation, 
according to the university."  
 Russia's Foreign Ministry has since confirmed that 23-year old Sapega is a Russian national and is facing charges 
in Belarus along with her boyfriend"in connection with the suspicion of having committed, between August and 
September 2020, offences under several articles of the Belarusian Criminal Code," according to an official 
statement[4].  
 Protasevich was an influential figure in independent and opposition Belarusianmedia reporting, specifically via a 
popular Telegram channel, which helped fuel massive anti-Lukashenko protests since his controversial re-election 
to a sixth term late last summer (which will extend his 27-years in power).

 Sofia Sapega stands accused of assisting Protasevich in helping to organize protests, but also publishing personal 
information of law enforcement personnel to the internet, which is a crime in Belarus.  
 Within a couple days after their detention, videos appeared online of the two "confessing" to a litany of crimes 
which has outragedthe Belarusian opposition as it has the hallmarks of a forcedconfession, given also it's expected 
to come with significant prison sentences.  
 Belarus release a video of Roman Protasevich claiming that he is in good health and being treated lawfully. He 
also acknowledges he was at the protests and is cooperating with the govt. 
 This has all the hallmarks of a forced confession and I can only imagine how fearful he is. https://t.co

 The two are facing charges related to organizing riots which could bring 15 years in prison  
 #Belarus[10] @novaya_gazeta[11] reported that Sofia Sapega might be charged under two articles - plotting riots 
(up to 15 years in prison) and organisation of action that violate public order. 'Riots' in Belarus are organised by 26-
year old bloggers and 23-year-old students. Interesting pic.twitter .com/d9Eajw2ERP[12] ;

 They are expected to be kept in pre-trial detention for up to months, while Belarusian opposition leaderSviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya issued a statement through a spokesman from neighboring Lithuania saying of Sapega that "Sheis 
guilty of being a friend of Roman. And they forced her to confess to 'crimes' she did not commit."  
 Various leaders have weighed in on the pair's fate in particular in the wake of the "confession" videos, with Britain's 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson denouncing Belarus[14]: "The video of Roman Protasevich makes for deeply 
distressing viewing. As a journalist and a passionate believer in freedom of speech I call for his immediate release." 
And he added a moment the EU and multiple Western governments are preparing further sanctions:"Belarus' 
actions will have consequences."

to the unified "outrage" generated with this fresh Belarus saga  
 I spoke today to @krystalball[15] and @esaagar[16] about the extreme, glaring similarities between what Belarus

Belarus hijacks Western complacency

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has once again demonstrated the lengths to which he will go to crack 
down on his opponents. On 23 May, he deployed a MiG-29 fighter jet to force down a commercial flight, which was 
traveling from Athens to Vilnius, shortly before it left Belarusian airspace. The purpose was to apprehend Roman 
Protasevich, the former editor-in-chief of the Belarusian opposition publication and social-media channel Nexta, 
who was arrested after the plane landed in Minsk. 
 Why a regime that is already under US and EU sanctions would go so far as to hijack a plane travelling from one 
EU member state to another is not hard to fathom. Nexta is Lukashenko's public enemy number one. More than just 
a news portal with millions of followers across multiple social-media platforms (especially Telegram), Nexta has 
been the single most important conduit for information in Belarus since the country's fraudulent presidential 
election[1] last August. 
 In addition to reporting on Belarusian security forces' violent crackdown against peaceful demonstrators, Nexta had 
provided daily instructions on when, where and how Belarusians should mobilise during last year's countrywide 
mass protests against Lukashenko's bogus election victory. Its Sunday calls for a national march for freedom 
brought as many as 200,000 people into the streets of Minsk. And all of these demonstrators knew precisely what 
to do, because they were following the playbook published by Protasevich and his colleague, Nexta founder Stepan 
Putilo. 
 Following this unprecedented uprising, Lukashenko's regime panicked, and for good reason. Nexta was collecting 
and sharing information and photos from all over Belarus. Every message, photo and call to action that it published 
went viral, reaching people across the country and around the world. 
 The key to Nexta's power was that it based itself outside of Belarus, in Warsaw. The Lukashenko regime could 
neither turn off its internet connection nor imprison or shoot it, as it was doing with opposition outlets and protesters 
still in Belarus. Lukashenko was doubtless infuriated by the fact that the protests were being guided not so much by 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the likely winner of the August election, but by an elusive new-media operator beyond 
Belarus's borders. 
 Since the release in March of a Nexta documentary exposing Lukashenko's ill-gotten riches (similar to a recent 
viral film about Russian President Vladimir Putin published by the now-imprisoned opposition leader Alexei 
Belarus hijacks Western complacency
Navalny[2]), Lukashenko has been prepared to move heaven and earth to take down his 20-something btes noires. 
In his mind, Nexta is the keystone buttressing all of the various fronts of the resistance. 
 Because the Ryanair flight Protasevich was on was much closer to Vilnius than to Minsk, the Lukashenko regime's 
claim that a bomb threat necessitated an emergency landing in the Belarusian capital is not credible. Once it was 
on the ground in Minsk, they made a fleeting show of searching passengers and their luggage before quickly 
apprehending the young dissident and his girlfriend. 
 The detention of Protasevich's girlfriend is a classic method of the KGB (as the Belarusian security service is still 
called), particularly when the intent is to extract confessions. Protasevich is an extremely valuable catch for 
Lukashenko, because (the dictator assumes) he has the contacts of virtually all of Belarus's activists. The day after 
seizing Protasevich, the regime released a video[3] of him admitting to his past participation in the protests. 
 The same tactic has also been used on Tikhanovskaya, whose husband was already in prison. When she was 
abducted after the first August protests in Minsk, she was forced to record a speech calling for an end to the 
uprising, most likely after having seen her husband being threatened with torture. She has since been expelled from 
the country, and because everyone in Belarus is familiar with these methods, no one blames her for remaining 
largely on the sidelines. 
 The hijacking is meant to send a message. To the opposition, Lukashenko wants to say, 'Your days are numbered. 
You are traitors, and we kill traitors.' And to the EU, he has issued a direct challenge: 'We can make fools of you 
whenever it suits us, and you will not hurt us, because you are weak.' 
 Such conclusions are not unwarranted. After all, the Kremlin, whose domestic supporters gloated about the 
hijacking and Protasevich's arrest, poisoned Navalny with a nerve agent and paid almost no price for it. The US, 
UK, EU and others expressed concern and imposed symbolic sanctions, and Russia responded by putting Navalny 
in a labour camp. 
 When the Czech Republic revealed[4] last month that Russia had been behind explosions at a weapons depot that 
killed two Czechs in 2014, the reaction was much the same. In fact, US President Joe Biden's administration has 
just waived sanctions against a company building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. 
Clearly it's money, not principles, that matter. 
 Lukashenko is following Russia's example. The Kremlin has long gloried in embarrassing foreign security services 
that try to protect opposition figures, usually by attacking exiled dissidents right under their noses, as with the March 
2018 attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury. 
 Protasevich had received political asylum in Lithuania. Given that Nexta is based in Poland, it's worth asking if the 
Polish authorities did everything they could—or anything at all—to protect and warn him and his colleagues against 
the dangers they faced. It should have been clear that Protasevich and Putilo were in danger. It's well known that 
Russia and Belarus will target those they consider traitors, even when they're abroad. Now it's well known how far 
they will go for that purpose.

May 26, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 ATHENS - An incident, in which a Belarusian warplane intercepted a flight between EU-members Greece and 
Lithuania and forced it down in Minsk on May 23, where a dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested 
might have set a dangerous precedent for international aviation. 
 'So far, air traffic regulations were the area where international cooperation worked largely reliably and not 
disturbed by unpredictable political needs,' GLOBSEC Policy Institute Director Alena Kudzko told New Europe on 
May 26, adding that this incident might change the trust that the air space is safe. 
 In an incident denounced by Western countries as 'state piracy,' Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko reportedly personally ordered the MiG-29 fighter jet to intercept the Ryanair plane to the Minsk airport 
after a bomb threat. 
 'If it worked for Lukashenko, why wouldn't any government ground flights at will to go after wanted passengers?' 
Kudzko asked. 'This incident also directly endangers the safety of all passengers on board. Airlines and individual 
travelers might want to think twice about the routes they are to take,' she added. 
 According to the GLOBSEC expert who was born and grew up in Belarus, the harsh international criticism and 
reaction aims to avoid the incidence becoming a precedent as it would signify lawlessness in airspace. Kudzko 
noted, however, the sanctions, including making Belarus effectively a no-fly zone and banning the Belarusian 
national carrier from flying to European countries, are a message not only to Lukashenko though. 'This is also a 
message to any other government, any other regime, or nongovernmental actor: this behavior is not going to be 
tolerated, do not even think about it,' she said. 
 Asked if EU and international response was enough, Kudzko said the European Union and other countries are 
reacting both swiftly and consequentially. 'It is an important and clear sign that this behavior - by anyone, not just 
Lukashenko - is not acceptable,' she said. 
 A different question is also what impact the sanctions will have on Belarus and the Lukashenko-led authorities. 
'The EU has done an impressive job mobilizing within 24 hours. This quick reaction changes the dynamics of the 
situation and clearly indicates not only the position of the EU but also sets a path to action that goes beyond strong 
verbal statements. Of course, the sanctions have not entered into force yet - it was a political agreement, the details 
still need to be worked out,' Kudzko said. 
Belarus skyjacking to get dissident journalist rattles EU
 She stressed that any sanctions should be thought about only as part of the strategy towards a particular country 
or a particular problem. 'Sanctions alone, especially not particularly strong ones as in the case of Belarus until now, 
are rarely sufficient to change the regime. As part of the broader package, they do play an important role in 
defunding the regime, undermining its economic and political sustainability, and narrowing the scope of maneuver 
for the authorities. Also, to have a painful effect, sanctions need time,' Kudzko said, explaining that with each 
passing month and year, cumulative effect is stronger. 
 'When I am talking about a broader package, it is important to remember that there are other policies in place, 
introduced by the EU and other Western countries, that also play an important role and that need to be further 
strengthened,' Kudzko said. 'Here, I mean support to the victims of repressions, support to independent media, visa 
free provisions for Belarusians, economic package for post-Lukashenko Belarus to support the reform process,' she 
added. 
 Enquiring minds want to know 
 Pratasevich's arrest after the airplane was diverted to Belarus appears to have been carried out with the help of 
secret agents operating on Greek territory, Kathimerini reported. According to the Greek newspaper, while still at 
Athens International Airport, Pratasevich is said to have informed colleagues via the Telegram messaging 
application that he was approached by an unknown Russian-speaking man who took a snap of him. Reportedly the 
agents also boarded the same flight as Pratasevich and got off in Minsk where the plane was diverted. 
 Analysts across the EU and in world capitals are probably wondering if this incident highlighted any weaknesses in 
the Greek or EU/ Schengen visa issuance system as its become clear intelligence operatives somehow entered the 
Schengen zone and boarded the flight in Athens. 
 Backed by Russia, Lukashenko has managed to successfully crack down on protesters, with Belarus' security 
services remaining loyal to him. 'It is yet unclear what role Russia has played in the incident per se,' Kudzko told 
New Europe. 'So far, we do not have many details. Russia has also had a rather reserved reaction to the incident. 
While supporting the line that Lukashenko acted within the law and followed proper rules to respond to the security 
alert, the Kremlin seems not to be willing to engage too much. There is a bit of a 'wait-and-see' tactic that gives the 
Kremlin time to calibrate its reaction based on the developments inside Belarus but also taking into consideration 
the international reactions,' the GLOBSEC Policy Institute Director said. 
 'But in general, indeed, (Russian President) Vladimir Putin is the main, if not only, remaining supporter of 
Lukashenko who also provides financial, political and other help. Putin knows it very well. He will and is already 
playing a king maker. This is also why the argument that sanctions push Lukashenko closer to Russia do merit a 
serious concern,' Kudzko said. 
 Asked if the Belarus incident would further deteriorate relations between Brussels and Moscow, she said EU-
Russia relations have been sour and have been turning sourer. The situation in Belarus is a contributing factor to 
the deterioration of the relations, but it is not the only one. So far, I don't see a clear strategy proposed by either the 
EU or Russia that would improve the state of the relations between Brussels and Moscow. At least on the EU side, 
Kudzko said, there is an understanding that this state of relations is neither stable nor desirable and there is a 
realization that there should be a strategy that is broader than sanctions. How exactly it will or could look like is not 
well elaborated at this point.

May 26, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 YouTube took action against a pro-Belarus channel for inappropriate ads this week, according to Rest of World.[1] 
The account's ads used footage from Roman Protasevich's[2] confession video released by Belarusian authorities. 
Protasevich's father told Reuters on Tuesday his son's statements seem coerced. See more stories on Insider's 
business page[3]. 
YouTube took action this week after advertisements that featured videos posted by Belarusian authorities of 
detained journalist and dissident Roman Protasevich[4] and his partner Sofia Sapega[5] ran on the platform, 
according to Rest of World.[6]  
Protasevich and Sapega were arrested in Minsk on Sunday after Belarusian officials sent a fighter jet to divert a 
Ryanair flight[7] from Athens to Vilnius the couple was traveling on, sparking international outrage. In the following 
days, Belarusian authorities released videos[8] of both Protasevich and Sapega talking about organizing mass 
protests against President Alexander Lukashenko last year.  
Protasevich's father, Dzmitry, told Reuters on Tuesday his son's statements in the video appeared coerced.[9]  
"I think he was forced. It's not his words, it's not his intonation of speech - he is acting very reserved, and you can 
tell he is nervous," he said.  
Following the release of the videos, several[10] Twitter[11] users[12] noticed YouTube ads that showed footage 
from the Belarusian-released statements from Protasevich and Sapega. -Tadeusz Giczan (@TadeuszGiczan) May 
25, 2021[13]  
Rest of World traced the ads to a pro-Belarusian government channel[14] whose name translates to "Belarus, 
country for life." The patriotic channel has fewer than 2,000 subscribers and features content praising Belarusian 
security forces and mocking opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Protasevich and Sapega's videos are 
both featured on the channel as well.  
Screenshots[15] posted[16] on social media suggest the advertisements directed viewers to a Telegram channel of 
pro-government content with nearly 80,000 subscribers, according to Rest of World. Another Twitter user shared a 
screenshot[17] of an apparent advertisement that featured Sapega's confession video as well. 
A spokesperson for YouTube's parent company, Google, told Rest of World's Louise Matsakis that the company 
had taken action against both of the advertisements for violating its content policies. 
YouTube said it removed 2 ads featuring videos of Belarus hostages' admission videos: report
"YouTube has always had strict policies around the type of content that is allowed to serve as ads on our platform," 
a spokesperson told Matsakis. "We quickly remove any ads that violate these policies." -Louise Matsakis 
(@lmatsakis) May 26, 2021[18]  
Google's publicly available guidelines[19] on "Sensitive Events" say it does not allow ads that "potentially profit from 
or exploit a sensitive event with significant social, cultural, or political impact, such as civil emergencies, natural 
disasters, public health emergencies, terrorism, and related activities, conflict, or mass acts of violence."  
The platform has previously come under fire for both its content[20] and advertising[21] practices. The site has 
traditionally allowed political advertisement, though Google temporarily banned[22] all political ads after the 2020 
election. 
According to Rest of World, social media users last year complained online about advertisements on YouTube 
promoting Belarusian government propaganda that appeared to come from the same "Belarus, country for life" 
channel. The company reportedly did not respond to Matsakis' questions about any past action against the channel.

 PARIS - The European Union pledged to deliver at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to low- and middle-
income countries by year's end, and develop vaccine production capacity in poorer nations, as it wrapped up a two-
day summit in Brussels. 
After being criticized for a slow vaccination start, European leaders say they are steaming ahead on COVID-19 
inoculations, securing 1.8 billion doses to cover the next two years — enough to export to needy countries outside 
the 27-member bloc. The bloc says it's also on track to surpass goals of exporting 100 million doses to developing 
countries. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, "We are working on an initiative to invest one billion 
euros from Team Europe to develop vaccine manufacturing in Africa — the capacity itself in Africa — it's a specific 
initiative with our African partners. An initiative not only for the production, so to build up the manufacturing 
capacities, but also for skills development, for the management of the supply train of, for example, the necessary 
regulatory framework through the African Medicines Agency."

the Music Auditorium in Rome, Italy, April 14, 2021. In Europe, where many countries are emerging from lockdowns 
and hospitalizations are dropping, von der Leyen said the EU was on track to inoculate 70 percent of its adults by 
the end of July. Europe's Medicines Agency is now considering whether to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 
12- to 15-year-olds. 
Meanwhile, special COVID-19 digital travel passes aim to open up summer travel for EU citizens who are either 
vaccinated, immune from having contracted the virus, or have tested negative for it.  
Together, says analyst Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel economic research group, the 
developments are shaping a more favorable tourism outlook for Europe.

"I think things are looking more promising," he said. "I still think that late summer will look better than early summer. 
But I think we're on track to have a summer at least as good as last summer, and probably better."  
Other topics 
On Monday, EU leaders announced a flight ban and other toughened sanctions against Belarus, after the forced 
landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk and the arrest of a dissident journalist.  
But speaking from Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron said progressive sanctions had their limits and 
the EU needed to profoundly redefine its relationship with both Belarus and Russia. 
Member states also discussed the thorny issue of national emissions targets to meet the bloc's overall goal of 
reducing greenhouse gases by 55 percent by 2030, and becoming climate neutral by 2050.

 Belarus diverted a Ryanair plane on Sunday and arrested a critical journalist on board. Roman Protasevich often 
criticized the Belarus government and is charged with organizing protests. Belarus released a video of Protasevich 
on Monday. His father said he looked coerced and beaten up. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The father of the detained journalist Roman Protasevich has said that he looked beaten up and coerced in a new 
video[2] released of him the Belarus government. 
Protasevich was taken into custody on Sunday after a Ryanair plane carrying him from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, 
Lithuania, was forced to land in Belarus[3] after the pilots received a fake security report[4] from local authorities. 
Protasevich is one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics. He had been living in Poland 
since 2019 over fears for his safety, and has continued to criticize Lukashenko from afar. Belarus accused 
Protasevich of terrorism and provoking riots last year. 
On Monday, Belarusian authorities posted a video of Protasevich[5], in which he admitted to organizing protests in 
Minsk last year. 
"Right now I continue to cooperate with police and confess to organizing mass protests," Protasevich said, Sky 
News reported[6]. He also said he was cooperating with authorities and continued to "provide evidence related to 
the mass rallies in Minsk," according to a translation by Insider. -Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) May 24, 
2021[7] Protasevich father, Dzmitry, told Reuters on Tuesday that that confession seemed forced. 
''I think he was forced. It's not his words, it's not his intonation of speech, he is acting very reserved and you can 
see he is nervous," he said. 
"And it's not his pack of cigarettes on the table - he doesn't smoke these. So I think he was forced." 
He said: "My son cannot admit to creating the mass disorders, because he just didn't do any such thing. It's unlikely 
he went for a deal with prosecutors. I think it's just that he was forced to record the message." 
Dzmitry Protasevich went on to say that it looked as if his son had been beaten up. "It is very likely that his nose is 
broken, because the shape of it is changed," he said. 
Lukashenko's office said the president personally scrambled a MiG-29 fighter jet to escort the Ryanair plane to the 
ground on Sunday. 
The father of captured journalist Roman Protasevich said he looked forced and beaten up in his video 
confession from Belarus
In a Monday statement[8], Ryanair called the diversion "was an act of aviation piracy" and Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary told an Irish radio station[9] that "the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist." 
After the passengers were informed that plane was being diverted to Minsk on Sunday, Protasevich told fellow 
passengers that he was "facing the death penalty," the Lithuanian news site Delfi News[10] reported. 
In a video published by The Washington Post[11], one passenger identified as Mantas said that upon learning of 
the diversion, Protasevich immediately started destroying his electronic equipment. Read the original article on

 Roman Protasevich pleaded with cabin crew not to land Flight 4978 in Minsk, according to Politico[1]. Passengers 
said the flight was "just minutes" from its destination when the pilot announced an emergency landing. Protasevich 
told passengers he was "facing the death penalty." See more stories on Insider's business page[2]. 
Roman Protasevich, the Belarusian journalist and activist who was detained in Minsk[3] on Sunday, pleaded with 
cabin crew not to ground the Athens-Vilnius flight in the Belarus capital, out of fear for his life, according to 
Politico[4].  
Belarusian authorities on Sunday sent a fighter jet to divert the Ryanair plane, citing a bogus bomb threat. When the 
passenger plane was forced to land in Minsk, police officers boarded the jet and arrested Protasevich and his 
girlfriend, sparking international outrage.  
Passengers on Ryanair Flight 4978 told the outlet that the plane was "just minutes" from its destination in Lithuania 
when the pilot announced the plane would make an emergency landing in Minsk.  
Initially, many of the flight's 171 passengers worried there was something wrong with the plane or the Vilnius 
airport, Politico reported. 
But Protasevich - a 26-year old dissident who has been openly critical of Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko's rule - knew what was really happening, according to multiple media reports.  
Passengers on the flight told The Daily Beast[5] that as soon as Ryanair announced the diversion, Protasevich 
"immediately" opened the overhead compartment to collect his electronics, handing his laptop and phone to his 
girlfriend, Sofia Sapega.[6]  
"Behind me, a man stands up and says he wants to talk to the steward," Raselle, a Lithuanian woman who lives in 
Greece, told Politico. "He was shocked and scared." 
Protasevich then began to plead with the crew. 
"Don't do this. They will kill me," he reportedly said. "I am a refugee."  
According to eyewitnesses, a flight attendant cited "legal agreements" as the reason the plane had to land.  
Though other passengers remained mostly calm, passengers told AFP reporter Katy Lee[7] that Protasevich 
expressed fear and told other passengers he was "facing the death penalty." 
Belarusian journalist reportedly pleaded with crew before being detained in Minsk: 'Don't do this. They will kill 
me.'
"He was not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid," passenger Edvinas Disma told Lee. "It 
looked like if the window had been open, he would have jumped out of it."  
Once in Minsk, authorities removed passengers from the plane in groups of five, while dogs sniffed them and their 
bags, Politico reported.  
One passenger, Saulius Danauskas, told Baltic news site Delfi[8], that he quickly realized the bomb threat had been 
a ruse.  
"When we landed people were standing around the plane doing nothing, looking pleased with themselves," 
Danauskas told the outlet. "They didn't let us out for half an hour. If there was a bomb on the plane, why would they 
not let us out?" 
Passengers told The New York Times[9] that Protasevich's luggage was checked twice before a security officer 
took him to the terminal, where he was then arrested.  
"Roman was with us and after we arrived they took him and his girlfriend," Raselle told Politico. "All very discreetly. 
He was very calm, didn't shout, he followed them, somehow accepting his destiny." 
For the next seven hours, passengers said they waited. 
"The Belarusian authorities treated us like prisoners, we were so many hours in the bus, then at the airport for 
hours without water or being able to go to the toilet, all in order to have this show that they were actually searching 
for something, when they only wanted to get the guy," Raselle told Politico. "It was a circus, a fiasco." 
Belarusian state media has reported that it was Lukashenko who gave the "unequivocal order" to ground the plane 
in Minsk. Flightradar.com data that shows the jet was closer to its destination in Lithuania than Minsk, Insider's 
Cheryl Teh reported.  
Lawyers looking to help Protasevich told The Times they believe he is being held in a jail in Minsk operated by the 
Belarusian intelligence service. 
On Monday, Belarusian authorities posted a video[10] of Protasevich, in which he said he was cooperating with 
authorities. 
The international response has been swift. On Monday, the European Union moved to isolate Belarus[11], ordering 
all EU-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banning Belarusian airlines from entering EU airspace and 
landing in its airports.  
The White House has called for an international investigation[12] into the flight's diversion and President Joe Biden 
released a statement applauding the European Union's call for economic sanctions.  
"The United States will continue to stand with the people of Belarus in their struggle," Biden said. Read the original

 EU leaders are to discuss the bloc's fight against COVID-19 and climate change on day two of their summit. The 
first day saw unusually quick action taken against Belarus over the forced landing of a Ryanair flight.EU leaders are 
turning their attention to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the urgent problem of climate change on the 
second day of a special meeting of the European Council on Tuesday. 
This comes after they agreed on Monday to impose new sanctions on Belarus after Minsk forced a Ryanair 
passenger jet to land to arrest an activist journalist on board. 
What is on Tuesday's agenda? 
Although developments connected to Belarus are likely to figure largely at the leaders' talks on day two as well, the 
topic officially slated for discussion is the EU's response to COVID-19. 
The talks will focus not only on current measures to stem the spread of the illness, but also on how to counter the 
economic fallout caused by the pandemic. 
The leaders will also discuss the EU's efforts to combat climate change. 
Among other things, they will attempt to come up with guidelines to reach binding EU targets to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
The bloc is aiming to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. 
What happened on Monday? 
Monday's debate was dominated by events in Belarus surrounding the forced landing of a Ryanair plane and the 
arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a government-critical journalist.  
Among other things, EU leaders called for further targeted economic sanctions on Belarus and urged all EU-based 
carriers to avoid flying through Belarusian airspace. 
They also called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a law student. 
The leaders also discussed EU-Russian relations in face of actions by Moscow that they termed "illegal, 
provocative and disruptive." 
Such actions include Russian support for an insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the poisoning and then 
imprisonment of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny. 
At the meeting, leaders also condemned the arrest of Mali's interim President Bah N'Daw and Prime Minister 
Moctar Ouane and said the EU would consider sanctions against those obstructing the Malian transition.

 Belarus on Sunday diverted a flight so it could arrest the dissident Roman Protasevich. Russia on Monday called it 
an "absolutely reasonable approach." The UK foreign secretary said he suspects Russian knowledge. The Kremlin 
denied involvement. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Russia is the sole country standing by Belarus after it intercepted a commercial flight to detain an outspoken 
dissident[2], prompting experts and officials to suspect Moscow's involvement in the plot. 
Roman Protasevich, 26, was taken into custody on Sunday[3] after a Ryanair plane carrying him from Greece to 
Lithuania was forced to land in Belarus[4] after the pilots received a fake security report[5] from local authorities. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said he believed KGB agents[6] were on the diverted flight. 
The UK, US[7], and the EU[8] slammed Belarus' move, calling it a violation of aviation law and human rights. 
Meanwhile, Russia has defended Belarus' actions and used it to accuse western nations of hypocrisy. 
On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that Belarus had treated the incident with an "absolutely 
reasonable approach."  
Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, also wrote in a Facebook post[9]: "The internet 
remembers all cases of violent abductions, forced landings and illegal arrests made by 'peace officers and 
guardians of morality,'" referring to western democracies. 'Belarus would not have hijacked an EU plane without 
Russian approval' Even before Russia's show of support to Belarus, experts have suspected its involvement. 
Belarus is heavily reliant on Russia financially, with Moscow long working to lure[10] Belarus away from western 
European alliances. 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has also turned to Russian President Vladimir Putin for support in the 
past: When anti-government protests swept Belarus last fall, Lukashenko publicly asked Putin for help, and Putin 
sent support in the form of state-media journalists and surveillance resources, European intelligence sources told 
Insider at the time[11]. 
In a series of tweets Sunday[12], Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University, said: "Belarus would not 
have hijacked an EU plane without Russian approval" and that "possibly the hijacking was even a Russian 
initiative." 
Russia is the only country to support Belarus after it intercepted a plane to detain a dissident. Experts have 
questioned whether Putin was involved.
In response, Nigel Gould-Davies, the former UK ambassador to Belarus, said[13] he "had no reason to believe" the 
theory that Russia orchestrated the plot, but added "that doesn't mean to say Russia doesn't approve or didn't 
assist." 
On Monday, Britain's foreign secretary also suspected Russian knowledge in the interception. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," Dominic Raab said, according to Reuters [14], caveating that he didn't have "any clear 
details" on Russian involvement so far. 
Timothy Ash, a senior emerging-markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, also said Monday that 
Lukashenko "would not have risked his relationship with the Kremlin by undertaking such a cavalier move unless he 
had been first given the green light by Putin," CNBC reported[15]. 
Russia has denied any involvement in the interception. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed 
the idea that his country knew anything about the Belarus plot, saying that widespread anti-Russian sentiment 
meant that Russia is accused of everything these days, Reuters reported[16]. Read the original article on Business

Angela Merkel: Russian role in Belarus incident not clear

 Chancellor Angela Merkel has said questions remain about the role of Russia in the forced landing of a plane by 
Belarus. She also said a video showing arrested dissident Raman Pratasevich in custody gave rise to concern.The 
German chancellor on Tuesday said unanswered questions remained about Russia's involvement in the forced 
landing of a plane by Belarus. 
Angela Merkel said a Kremlin connection had been discussed at an EU summit focused on Minsk's diversion of a 
Ryanair flight — and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board. 
"We touched on the question of whether Russia had anything to do with it," Merkel said in Brussels after the 
summit. "We did not have any firm findings on Russia's role," she said. 
The chancellor said she would raise the issue at a future meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Merkel previously described Belarus' contention that it was simply responding to a credible security threat on board 
the plane was "completely implausible."  
Russia sides with ex-Soviet ally 
Western powers denounced Sunday's scrambling of a warplane to escort the Athens to Vilnius Ryanair passenger 
jet as "state piracy." 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described the incident as "state hijacking," and both France and Ireland 
have labeled it as piracy. Brussels responded with new sanctions on Belarus and requested EU carriers to refrain 
from flying over Belarusian airspace. 
Moscow, however, says Minsk's actions were "absolutely reasonable." 
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab on Monday said a Russian role in the operation appeared likely. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," Raab told the UK parliament. 
Kremlin denies involvement 
Russia has denied involvement and accused Western countries of hypocrisy. In particular, it noted that a Bolivian 
presidential plane was diverted to Austria in 2013 after reports that US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden was on 
board. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday claimed that anti-Russian sentiment had fueled initial allegations 
that Moscow was involved. 
Peskov also said he hoped that 26-year-old Pratasevich's girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen detained along 
with the Belarusian journalist, would soon be released. 
Angela Merkel: Russian role in Belarus incident not clear
Russia confirmed on Tuesday that the 23-year-old law student was being held by Belarus under suspicion of crimes 
at the time of protests in the country last year. 
Three other passengers also left the plane at Minsk on Sunday before it was allowed to proceed to the Lithuanian 
capital. Initial assertions that the three passengers had been Russian passport holders turned out to be false. 
'Naivety towards Russian relations fading' 
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told DW that, after the EU leaders' discussions, she believed the Belarus 
incident may have helped shift EU perspectives on Russia. 'I think the naivety toward Russian relations is fading,' 
she said after talks with other EU leaders in Brussels. 
'After Belarus — where we were very united — we also had a discussion on Russia. And these two are very 
interlinked." 
"We saw that even some countries that were previously a bit skeptical regarding Russia's deeds were now very 
shocked. I think the naivety towards Russian relations is fading," Kallas said. 
Video of dissident 'concerning' 
A video emerged on Monday showing Pratasevich confessing to some accusations leveled against him, with 
apparent bruising to the face. 
In further comments after the summit, Merkel said the video was "concerning" and described the forced landing as 
"an unprecedented and unacceptable act." 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Belarusian President Alexander Lukasahenko must pay a "bitter price" 
for detaining Pratasevich.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
Pro-Kremlin media have mobilised a common - and flawed - instrument. In literature on Ethics, it's referred to as the 
'Golden Rationalisation[2]' - the notion that an unethical or criminal act is supposed to be less unethical or criminal if 
'everybody does it'. If others lie, steal, or cheat - why shouldn't I be allowed to do it? 
On 23 May, a Belarusian fighter jet intercepted Ryanair flight FR4987 en route from Athens to Vilnius. The Minsk Air 
Control reported a bomb on board the aircraft and demanded the flight redirected to Minsk. As the plane landed, a 
dissident journalist wanted by the Belarusian authorities for 'extremism' was detained. No bombs were found. In the 
afternoon 24 May,Belarusian authorities claimed[3]that the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas had organised 
the bomb threat, allegedly to force the EU to demand an Israeli cease-fire in Gaza. This came several days after a 
cease-fire hadalready been negotiated[4]. 
This incident drew virtually unanimous international condemnation. Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ireland-based Ryanair, 
describes the incident as 'state-sponsored hijacking[5]'. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney calls it 'aviation-piracy 
that is state-sponsored[6]'. Most of the passengers on board the aircraft were Lithuanians, and Lithuanian 
authorities are currently investigating the incident as an 'act of terrorism[7]'. 
Pro-Kremlin media suggest that 'everybody' forces down passenger liners with fighter jets. Russia's Foreign 
Ministry spokespersonMaria Zakharova[8]asks the West not to apply 'double standards' to Belarus, aseverybody 
does it! Her boss, Foreign MinisterSergey Lavrov[9], follows the same talking points:everybody does it!: 
The most famous episode was in 2013, when Austria, after demands from the US, forced the airplane of the 
President of Bolivia to land, without giving any excuses. Less known is the incident in 2016, when an aircraft of the 
Belarusian airlines was forced to land in Kyiv, as Ukrainian Security Service was interested in an Armenian citizen 
on board the flight. He was 'taken off the flight', and the plane could depart. No apologies followed. 
Everybody Does It!
Here one must correct Mr Lavrov: The president of Ukraineactually apologised[10]for the incident and offered 
financial compensation to the airline. 
According to TheWashington Post[11], none of the examples cited by Ms Zakharova and others involved bomb 
scares or crackdowns on the political opposition. 
State News AgencyRIA Novosti suggests[12]that hijacking civilian aircraft is usual practice for security services 
everywhere/globally.Everybody does it!The agency forgets to mention that in the Ryanair case, the passenger 
plane was intercepted by a MiG-29 fighter jet belonging to the Belarusian Airforce, armed with air-to-air missiles. 
Overall, the pro-Kremlin ecosystem has quickly adopted to the 'Everybody does it'defence. The narrative is 
repeated inEnglish[13],German[14],Spanish[15],Arabic[16]; we read the same lines in pro-Kremlin media 
ofAzerbaijan[17],Georgia[18],Ukraine[19]andSerbia[20]. Everybody does the 'Everybody does it'. 
Kremlin-managed social media messaging is a little more diverse. RT editor-in-chief-Margarita Simonyanpraises 
Lukashenko's decision to use fighter jets against civilian aircraft.[21]Similar praise is relayed in Telegram channels 
sympathetic (and quite likely linked) toBelarusian authorities[22]. 
 What else does everybody do? 
 Sadly, this is not the first instance when the 'Everybody does it!' defence is invoked. The EUvsDisinfo database on 
disinformation contains a number of examples illustrating this line of conduct. According to the distorted logic of pro-
Kremlin, it was OK to illegallyannex Crimea[23], because the West recognised Kosovo.Russian violence against 
street protests is OK[24]because there have been isolated instances of violence in street protests in 
Europe.Russian doping is OK[25]because all countries use doping 
Justifying theft, violence, or drugs with the argument that 'everybody does it' is no defence. The annexation of 
Crimea is a widely recognized violation of international law; the Russian police' hard-handed crackdown on 
demonstrations in January 2021 was a violation of Russian law, and doping is simply cheating, which is punishable 
by international sports authorities. Whether or not others have violated the same laws is irrelevant.

May 25, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Top experts and officials say it's unlikely Belarus would've hijacked a flight without Russia's permission. Belarus's 
authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko relies heavily on Putin for support. Belarus is facing swift consequences 
over the incident, which could make it more reliant on Russia. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin likely gave Belarus the green light to force a RyanAir flight to land[2] in Minsk so 
that authorities could arrest a prominent dissident, top officials and experts say.  
Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko is heavily reliant on Putin's support from an economic, 
military, and political standpoint. It's therefore thought to be unlikely that the Belarusian dictator would make such 
an audacious move without the Russian leader's blessing.  
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Monday said that it was "very difficult to believe that this kind of action 
could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow." Raab added that there was 
no firm evidence of Russia's involvement.  
"Belarus would not have hijacked an EU plane without Russian approval," Yale historian Timothy Snyder 
tweeted[3].  
As world leaders have denounced Belarus's actions as state-sanctioned hijacking, Russia has continued to offer 
Belarus support following the incident, and dismissed suspicions of its involvement as "obsessive Russophobia."[4] 
The Ryainair flight, which was en route from Greece to Lithuania, was grounded under a fake bomb threat and 
escorted into Minsk by a fighter jet. 
After the forced landing, Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich was taken into custody. Protasevich 
has been a leading critic of Lukashenko, who faced mass protests in 2020 after he won a sixth term in an election 
widely viewed as rigged. The 26-year-old dissident fled Belarus in 2019 over fear of arrest, but continued to criticize 
Lukashenko while in exile.  
As Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday condemned the Belarusian government over the "brazen and 
shocking act,"[5] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov defended Belarus's actions as "reasonable."[6] 
Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova in a Facebook post accused Western countries of 
hypocrisy over the response. "It is shocking that the West calls the incident in Belarusian airspace 'shocking'," she 
wrote.[7] 
Putin likely gave Belarus the go-ahead to hijack the RyanAir plane, officials and experts say
Though there is suspicion of Russian involvement, the Biden administration has avoided making any explicit 
allegations. Discussing whether the US believed Russia played a role in the forced landing and arrest of 
Protasevich, White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday said, "I did not give any indication that we had 
that view yesterday, and that has not changed. We don't have a belief that that is the case."  
The White House on Tuesday announced that President Joe Biden will meet with Putin face-to-face for the first time 
since becoming commander-in-chief. Psaki during Tuesday's briefing indicated that Belarus would be discussed. -
CBS News (@CBSNews) May 25, 2021[8]  
Biden on Monday said he supported the EU's push to sanction Belarus and called for Protasevich's immediate 
release, adding that his administration would "develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible, in 
close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and international organizations."  
Meanwhile, Putin is set to meet with Lukashenko[9] later this week in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. 
With the EU sanctioning Belarus, barring flights over the county, and banning Belarusian airlines from using its 
airspace or airports, some analysts say that the incident has benefited Russia in the sense it's pushed Lukashenko 
even further away from the West.  
"Lukashenko will become an increasingly easy prey for the Kremlin," Alexander Klaskouski, an independent Minsk-
based political analyst, told the Associated Press[10]. "As a pariah country, Belarus will find it much more difficult to 
fend off the Kremlin demands for the introduction of a single currency, the deployment of air bases and access to 
lucrative Belarusian economic assets."

 Lukashenko has ruled the eastern European country of Belarus for over 26 years. In 2020, he rigged an election 
and declared that he won 80% of the vote, naming himself president for a sixth term. This week, he grounded a 
passenger plane in order to detain journalist Roman Protasevich. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
A dramatic series of events involving a Ryanair passenger jet being diverted and forced to land in Minsk[2] 
prompted an international outcry after it was revealed that the bomb threat that grounded the plan was simply a 
ruse to arrest journalist Roman Protasevich.[3] 
Protasevich, 26, is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of NEXTA, a news channel based in Poland[4] that spread 
clips of mass protests against Lukashenko via encrypted messaging app Telegram. He is a vocal opponent of 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and was in exile in the neighboring country of Lithuania[5] until he and 
his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega[6], were dragged off the Ryanair plane and detained.[7] 
The move drew condemnation from world leaders - including the US.[8] According to CNN[9], the European Union 
has sanctioned Belarus and will be calling on all EU airlines to not fly over the country. European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen added on Monday that further economic sanctions on the country would be put in 
place soon.  
But the root of the drama swirling around the Eastern European country lies in Lukashenko himself. The 66-year-old 
has kept a firm grip on power in Belarus for over 26 years - and has no qualms about enraging the international 
community just to detain one activist. A strongman with a military background and Russian ties The story of 
Lukashenko's rise to power in Belarus begins in 1990. Then, he was in his late 30s and was a promising young 
military man who just won an election to a parliamentary seat in the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
Lukashenko boasts[10] close ties to the Soviet Union, detailing a timeline of his previously held posts in the Soviet 
Army and his membership in the Soviet communist youth wing. At one point, in 1993, Lukashenko was named head 
of the Belarusian parliament's anti-corruption commission.  
In 1994, Lukashenko was elected president with 80.3% of the vote, running on the pledge to "take the country back 
from the abyss" - and has managed to hold on to power since. Lukashenko's hold on power wavers in 2020, and he 
is dubbed "Europe's last dictator" Lukashenko's hold on power has wavered in the last year as he faced strong

over 2 decades.
opposition in the 2020 election. Fearing that he might be toppled, he falsified election results[11] - declaring that he 
won 80% of the vote and giving himself a sixth term. 
This move sparked protests across the country[12]. Sanctions were even imposed last year by the UK and Canada 
against Belarus officials[13] in a bid by a group of Western nations, who tried to take Lukashenko to task for rigging 
the elections and repressing peaceful protests.[14] 
According to Politico[15], it is estimated that more than 35,000 Belarusians were arrested during this uprising, with 
thousands facing abuse and torture in police custody[16]. During the protests, Lukashenko attempted on multiple 
occasions to display a facade of strength - at one point releasing a video of himself stepping off a helicopter clad in 
a bulletproof vest while toting an assault rifle.[17] 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been a strong ally of the Belarusian leader - even extending a $1.5 billion loan 
to Belarus in 2020 as a "gesture of support"[18] and volunteering aid from the Russian police during the 
protests.[19] 
Al Jazeera[20] reported that Russia also sent in Kremlin-linked journalists to change the way the protests were 
covered in Belarusian state media. 
A 2020 report[21] from the Guardian indicated then that Lukashenko was cracking under pressure, though he 
continued to resist calls for him to resign. Some media outlets then dubbed Lukashenko "Europe's last dictator"[22] 
- though some argue that while he is a dictator, he will not be the last[23]. 
His handling of the COVID pandemic in Belarus[24] drew widespread criticism and further calls for him to step 
down. But Lukashenko has maintained his grip on power. 
During a visit to a Minsk wheeled tractor plant last year, he countered a question about fair elections by saying: "I 
am answering your question. We held elections. Until you kill me, there will be no other elections." Lukashenko's 
widespread crackdown on opposition and dissent https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/24/why-belarus-risked-
the-wrath-of-the-world-to-arrest-an-activist Analysts say that the grounding of the Ryanair passenger plane this 
week is an indication that Lukashenko will continue to intensify his crackdown on independent media and pursue 
journalists who are on the run - even at the cost of provoking the international community.  
"This is a political message to the Belarusian political migrants of the new wave, and on the other hand, to his 
supporters, the so-called 'electoral swamp,'" Igar Tyshkevich, a Belarusian analyst based in Ukraine, told Al 
Jazeera. 
"The message is that the government is strong and may get to anyone," Tyshkevich added. 
So perhaps the best encapsulation of Lukashenko's life might, ironically, be one that he wrote about himself.  
"My life, just like the lives of other presidents, is very busy. You wake up and keep running. What does it feel like to 
be on the run for 25 years? I got used to it," says a quote from Lukashenko that is proudly displayed on his official 
online biography.[25] 
It continues: "This hamster wheel keeps spinning, and there is no escaping it. If you stop, it will keep moving and 
throw you back. This is a mode of life. I am used to it." Read the original article on Business Insider[26]

 GENEVA - The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says the seizure by Belarus of a journalist 
traveling on a plane is tantamount to extraordinary rendition - a state-sponsored abduction. Belarusian journalist 
Raman Pratasevich was arrested after a Ryanair plane traveling from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, was 
diverted by a Belarusian fighter jet and forced to land in Belarus's capital, Minsk, on Sunday. Human rights officials 
say they are shocked by the manner in which the journalist was detained.

VIDEO.JPG?itok=7tJfxBzD Raman Pratasevich, detained when a Ryanair plane was forced to land in Minsk, is said 
to be seen in a pre-trial detention facility in Minsk, Belarus May 24, 2021, in this still image taken from video. 
(Telegram@Zheltyeslivy/Reuters TV) Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N . high commissioner, criticized the 
threat of military force to divert the plane from its flight path. 'Such abuse of state power against a journalist for 
exercising functions that are protected under international law is receiving, and deserves, the strongest 
condemnation. We fear for Raman Pratasevich's safety and wish to seek assurances that he is treated humanely 
and is not subjected to ill treatment or torture,' he said. Colville said Pratasevich's appearance on state TV Monday 
evening with bruising on his face is not reassuring. He said Pratasevich's so-called confession to serious crimes 
apparently was forced under torture, which is prohibited under international law. The U.S.-based Committee to 
Protect Journalists says it is unable to verify the time or circumstances under which the video was recorded. The 
CPJ has called for Pratasevich's immediate and unconditional release. Pratasevich is co-founder of the opposition 
Nexta channels, which helped mobilize street protests after Belarus's August 9 presidential election. President 
Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in that election, which has been widely viewed as rigged. The Minsk 
government has accused Pratasevich of terrorism and provoking riots after the Nexta channels became one of the 
main conduits for organizing last year's anti-Lukashenko protests over alleged election fraud. Colville said the 
arbitrary arrest of Pratasevich and manner of his seizure is a sign of an extremely worrying escalation in the 
government's crackdown on dissenting voices. 
'This astonishing episode constitutes a new phase in the Belarusian authorities' campaign of repression against 
journalists and civil society in general. In addition to the issues relating to Mr. Pratasevich, the forced landing of the 
UN Likens Belarus ' Seizure of Journalist to Extraordinary Rendition
passenger plane in Minsk terrorized passengers on board and exposed them to unnecessary danger, in violation of 
their human rights,' he said. 
Colville said he was also concerned about Pratasevich's friend, Sofia Sapaga, who reportedly also has been 
arbitrarily detained. His office is calling for their immediate release and says both should be allowed to continue on 
to Vilnius, their intended destination.

May 25, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 Two US Senators sent a letter Monday urging President Joe Biden to prohibit US flights over Belarus. The request 
comes after Belarus arrested Roman Protasevich after forcing the flight he was on to land. The letter was signed by 
Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican. See more stories on Insider's business 
page[1]. 
The "state-sponsored hijacking" of a civilian flight in order to arrest a dissident activist should prompt President Joe 
Biden to ban US airlines from flying over Belarus, two US senators said in a letter on Monday. 
Over the weekend, authorities in Belarus forced the landing of a Ryanair flight - sending up a fighter jet and claiming 
a possible terrorist threat - in order to arrest Roman Protasevich[2], a 26-year-old journalist and critic of the 
authoritarian regime led by President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarusian authorities have since posted a video of 
Protasevich[3] that his allies say appears to have been delivered under duress[4], Reuters reported. 
President Biden condemned the arrest in a statement Monday evening, calling it "a direct affront to international 
norms." Biden said he asked advisers "to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible." 
In the meantime, Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, 
want the president to keep US flights away from Eastern European nation. 
"In an effort to keep passengers and crew safe, we urge you to prohibit all US airlines from entering Belarusian 
airspace," they wrote in a joint missive[5]. The US has imposed a similar prohibition on flights over North Korea, the 
senators note. "We must protect innocent passengers from despotic regimes and stand in solidarity with dissidents 
who are being targeted." 
President Alexander Lukashenko, who has led Belarus since 1994, was ostensibly reelected last year. But that vote 
has been widely criticized as fraudulent, with the European Union refusing to recognize the results. 
The vote was followed by widespread protests in Belarus that were brutally repressed, with authorities detaining 
thousands, "many of them tortured or otherwise ill-treated," according to Amnesty International. Belarus accuses 
Protasevich of orchestrating the protests to overthrow the government.

 LONDON - Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Tuesday it is clear that Raman Pratasevich, 
the journalist arrested Sunday after the passenger jet he was traveling on was diverted and forced to land in Minsk, 
has been beaten in detention. Pratasevich appeared in a video posted online Monday, apparently filmed by 
Belarusian security services. He confessed to organizing anti-government protests. His supporters say marks on his 
face show he has been beaten. Speaking from Vilnius Tuesday, where she lives in exile, Tsikhanouskaya said that 
lawyers had not been allowed to see Pratasevich. 
'I think many have already watched the video with imprisoned Raman. He said that that he is being treated lawfully 
but he is clearly beaten and under pressure. There is no doubt that he may be tortured,' Tsikhanouskaya said. 'He 
was taken hostage like 421 political prisoners, and thousands of people who have not yet been recognized as 
political prisoners but are behind bars.'   The incident has been described as 'state-sponsored hijacking' by Western 
leaders, and many European airlines are now avoiding Belarusian airspace, a key route from Europe to Asia. 
Twenty-six-year old Pratasevich was detained Sunday, after the Ryanair Boeing 737 passenger jet he was traveling 
on was forced to land in Belarus as it flew over the country en route from Greece to Lithuania. There were 171 
passengers and crew on board. Pratasevich was visiting Athens at the same time as Tsikhanouskaya, who met 
several Greek government officials.

Belarusian state media have reported that President Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the flight to be 
intercepted. The United Nations' aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has said the 
incident may have violated the foundational treaty governing international civil aviation, the 1944 Chicago

Convention. Pratasevich and his Russian companion Sofia Sapega were arrested on the ground in Minsk. At least 
three other passengers also disembarked the plane and are believed to be security agents who were tracking 
Pratasevich.

outrageous behavior needs a strong answer, therefore the European Council decided that there will be additional 
sanctions on individuals that are involved in the hijacking but this time also on businesses and economic entities 
that are financing this regime,' von der Leyen said at a press conference in Brussels Monday evening. The former 
British ambassador to Belarus, Nigel Gould-Davies, welcomed the ratcheting up of sanctions against the Belarus 
government. 'I think given the escalation of Belarus' outrageous activities, the point is now to correspondingly 
escalate the sanctions and move from a situation where we're just imposing restrictions on individuals to a broader 
approach to putting pressure on the regime,' Gould-Davies told the Associated Press. 'And that means, among 
other things, going after the financial flows, the various ways in which Belarusian state companies are dependent 
on access to Western finance and Western markets. These are the money flows that help sustain the regime,' he 
added.

01/AP21026466551517.jpg?itok=UhnuZaHr FILE - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko attends a meeting 
with top officials in Minsk, Jan. 26, 2021. The European Union urged airlines to re-route around Belarus. Lufthansa, 
KLM, SAS, Air France, LOT and Singapore Airlines were among carriers that announced they would stop flying 
over the country Tuesday. Belarusian airlines will also be banned from EU airspace and airports. However, Europe 
has limited options in seeking to retaliate, says analyst Alex Titov of Queen's University Belfast. 'Ultimately, that's 
not going to move Lukashenko, because he's got his man now,' Titov told VOA. 'The European Union in particular, 
but the United States as well, don't really want to completely antagonize Belarus or lose it altogether and push it 
into Moscow's arms.' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed the condemnation Tuesday. 'The forced 
landing of a passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous and unacceptable,' Stoltenberg told reporters. 'This is a 
state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks down on 
freedom of expression and independent media. I welcome the additional measures agreed by the European Union. 
There must be an urgent international investigation. And journalist Pratasevich and his companion Sofia Sapega 
must be immediately released.' Bill Browder, the financier and political activist who has campaigned for sanctions 
against human rights abusers in Russia and elsewhere, said it is critical that the West responds forcefully. 'I think it 
sends a horrific message to every enemy of every dictatorship around the world - that you can literally be plucked 
out of the sky no matter where you are. And it's unprecedented, this type of thing, you have an internal EU flight 
that was basically grounded with fighter jets by a dictator. And there has to be harsh and serious consequences,' 
Browder said Tuesday. Pratasevich fled to Poland in 2019 and claimed political asylum. He ran the popular Nexta 
and Nexta Live channels on Telegram but recently switched to an alternative opposition social media platform. 
Since the protests began in August 2020 after a disputed election, Belarusian authorities have arrested an 
estimated 35,000 people. There is widespread evidence of torture. The operation to arrest Pratasevich was likely 
personally ordered by President Lukashenko, says analyst Alex Titov. 'The thing about the Belarusian protests is 
that there was very little structure and clear leaders and organization around them. So, the Telegram channel by 
two very young journalists in exile in Poland already suddenly became that sort of lynchpin seemingly, which was 
directing all the protests,' Titov said. U.S. President Joe Biden has asked his advisers to come up with options to 
hold those responsible for the forced landing of the Ryanair plane to be held to account. The United Nations called 
for 'a full, transparent and independent investigation.'

 The European Union is urging member nations to close their airspace and airports to all Belarusian airlines after 
Belarus forced a commercial jetliner to make an emergency landing Sunday in Minsk and arrested an opposition 
blogger critical of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.

A number of airlines, including Lufthansa, released statements earlier in the day stating they would not fly through 
Belarusian airspace. 
The EU is also calling for an investigation into the incident and is planning to sanction Belarusian officials 
responsible for the aircraft's diversion. 
Many members of the Belarusian government are already under EU sanctions because of last year's crackdown 
following the disputed August presidential election. 
The EU, as well as the United States, called on Lukashenko's government to immediately release Raman 
Pratasevich, a 26-year-old blogger who has been living in exile in Poland.

international airport outside Minsk, Belarus, May 23, 2021, in this photo released by telegram Chanel 
t.me/motolkohelp. Pratasevich, a former editor of the influential Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, was 
detained by police when Belarusian authorities searched the plane. The Minsk government said Lukashenko 
ordered his military to scramble a MiG-29 fighter to escort the plane to the Minsk airport. 
In a video released on Belarusian state TV Monday, Pratasevich is seen "confessing" to charges of responsibility in 
civil disturbances.

"I can say that I have no health problems. I continue cooperating with investigators and am confessing to having 
organized mass unrest in the city of Minsk," he said. 
But just before he and his girlfriend were led off a diverted plane by police, a trembling Pratasevich reportedly told a 
fellow passenger, "I'm facing the death penalty here." 
Ryanair Flight FR4978, originating in Athens, was diverted in Belarusian airspace about 10 kilometers from Vilnius, 
Lithuania — its planned destination — because of an alleged bomb threat.

On Monday, the airline called the incident "an act of aviation piracy" and said it is cooperating with investigations 
being conducted by European Union safety and security agencies and NATO.  
In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the Belarus government's role as "shocking" and 
said the United States is demanding an international probe of the incident. Belarus is a former Soviet republic with 
close ties to the Russian government. 
"It constitutes a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime," Psaki said. 
A United Nations spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres supports "a full, transparent and 
independent investigation into this disturbing incident." 
A total of 126 passengers left Athens on the flight but only 121 landed in Vilnius, in addition to the crew of six. 
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said he believed Belarusian security agents had been on the flight and had also 
disembarked in Minsk. That would seem to indicate the operation had effectively been coordinated with operatives 
on the ground in Greece.

Ryanair plane, carrying opposition figure Raman Pratasevich, in Minsk International airport, May 23, 2021, in this 
photo provided by ONLINER.BY. The Minsk government has accused Pratasevich of terrorism and provoking riots 
after the Nexta channels became one of the main conduits for organizing last year's anti-Lukashenko protests over 
election fraud. 
Lukashenko won his sixth term in the August election, claiming 80% of the votes, although many in the country 
accused him of rigging the vote. 
During the months of protests that followed, more than 34,000 people were arrested in Belarus, and thousands 
were brutally beaten. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. "strongly condemns the forced diversion of a flight 
between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich in Minsk. 
We demand his immediate release.

"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenko regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including U.S. citizens," Blinken said in his statement. 
The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists on Sunday said it was "shocked" by the incident, saying the 
Lukashenko government "has increasingly strangled the press in Belarus for the past year, detaining, fining and 
expelling journalists, and sentencing them to longer and longer prison terms." The CPJ called for Pratasevich's 
immediate release.  
Pratasevich had been in Athens covering a visit by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a former Belarusian presidential 
candidate who has declared herself the country's leader-in-exile because of the alleged widespread fraud during 
last year's elections. She called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to investigate the Sunday incident 
and the diversion of the Ryanair jet.  
She tweeted that Lukashenko's "regime endangered the lives of passengers onboard the plane. From now — no 
one flying over Belarus — can be secure. International reaction needed!"

 Germany will not send a team to the European Track Cycling Championships in Minsk as a result of the forced 
landing of a passenger plane. The organizers of the competition are under pressure to find an alternative host.The 
European Track Cycling Championships in Minsk next month will be without several of its top athletes, after Belarus 
purposely diverted a Ryanair passenger plane so that it could arrest a high-profile opposition activist. 
The German Cycling Federation, the BDR, was the first to announce it would not send a team on Tuesday. The 
BDR contacted the European Cycling Union (UEC), the body responsible for organizing the championships, and 
"made it clear that under these circumstances the German national track cycling team would not be able to 
participate" in the event, which is scheduled to take place in the Belarusian capital at the end of June. 
Representatives of Great Britain and the Netherlands have also signalled that those nations may withdraw. 
The BDR also pushed the UEC to find an alternative host. The action to arrest opposition activist Raman 
Pratasevich on Sunday was widely condemned as a "hijacking" by European leaders. In response, the European 
Union agreed to a new round of sanctions on the Belarusian regime of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko, 
including shutting Belarus out of European airspace. 
Decision to be made 
DW approached the UEC with a list of questions relating to the hosting of the championships on Monday but was 
told by the organization's president, Enrico Della Casa, that "due to the recent incorrect press articles published we 
do not wish to comment further." Della Casa didn't specify which articles he took issue with. The Danish newspaper 
Berlingske previously reported that the Netherlands, Lithuania and Denmark had all offered to step in as possible 
replacements, but that all three offers — which came at various points over the last year — were rejected by the 
UEC. 
The UEC published a statement on its website later on Tuesday saying that it was "carefully monitoring the 
situation" and that it would make a decision on the championships after a board meeting on Thursday. 
Sunday's incident has put a renewed spotlight on Belarus' hosting of sporting events. UEFA, European football's 
governing body, was recently criticized for awarding the 2025 Women's European Under-19 Championship to 
Belarus. In January, Minsk was stripped of its half of the Ice Hockey World Championship, amid a backlash from 
major sponsors, European politicians and opposition groups. 
Sanctions imposed 
Since Lukashenko's disputed re-election as president last August, some 35,000 people have been arrested in 
Belarus amid a violent crackdown on opposition protesters. 
Germany will not send cycling team to Belarus
Athletes have been among those detained or punished by the regime, leading the International Olympic Committee 
(IOC) to sanction Belarusian sports officials and warn other sports bodies to "respect these measures in the interest 
of protecting Belarusian athletes' rights." 
The IOC's remarks were taken by many to mean that Belarus shouldn't be awarded or allowed to retain the hosting 
rights for international competitions. However, despite pressure from the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation 
(BSSF), an opposition athlete-led movement, the UEC has so far decided to stick by Minsk. 
In a letter to the BSSF in March, a copy of which has been seen by DW, Della Casa wrote that "we are legally 
contracted to host this event at this time and location and were unable to find another suitable host on this date," 
adding that "the UEC respects the equality of all its member national federations and does not and cannot get 
involved in the internal matters of these federations." 
'Wise decision' 
Della Casa also pointed to the fact that there have been no major international track cycling competitions since 
early last year. "We would remind you that if the [championships] were to be removed from Belarus, it would be the 
athletes themselves who would lose the most from this decision." 
In a statement to DW, the BSSF said that it welcomed the "wise decision of the German cycling federation not to 
travel to Belarus" and once again called on the UEC to make the "only right decision when it is not too late and 
cancel" the championships in Belarus. 
"Considering the latest shocking turn of events we find it surprising that the senior management of the European 
Cycling Union takes time to make a decision that will primarily keep athletes, sports and media specialists safe," the 
BSSF said. "The decision will keep them out of any activities that can even remotely become part of the power 
legitimization of the world's most dangerous man. 
"European parliamentarians, as well as ministers of sports of the European Union member states, previously 
expressed their concern about the situation in Belarusian sport and have stated that it is not possible to hold any 
international sports competitions in the country where human rights are violated every day and human dignity is 
humiliated. That was even before the hijacking of the plane."

What effect will the EU's sanctions have on Belarus ?

 After Belarus diverted a Ryanair plane and arrested a dissident blogger, the EU was quick to impose new 
sanctions on Minsk. DW takes a look at the measures and what they entail.European Union leaders called 
Sunday's military interception of a Ryanair passenger plane and the subsequent arrest of an opposition blogger a 
"hijacking," an "attack on democracy" and an "international scandal." 
After Belarusian authorities took Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, into custody, the EU was 
uncharacteristically swift to slap new sanctions on Belarus. Monday's measures included a ban on Belarusian 
airlines using EU airspace or airports.  
'Completely implausible' 
Prior to his arrest, Raman Pratasevich, a known critic of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, was 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania. Minsk ordered the commercial plane flying over its airspace to land, claiming a 
bomb was on board — an explanation German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called "completely implausible." 
Belarusian state TV has since broadcast a video, showing Pratavesich with dark marks on his face, acknowledging 
his role in recent anti-government protests. The opposition says he was forced to film the statement.  
When EU leaders met on Monday in Brussels, they called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his 
girlfriend. They also unanimously agreed to hold Belarus accountable.  
"Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have severe consequences," European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen said. 
But what are the consequences and what do they entail? 
Restrictions on airspace 
Since Belarus intercepted a flight between two EU countries, the 27-nation bloc also decided to hit back in the 
skies. It has banned Belarus' airlines from its airspace and airports, as well as urging EU-based plane carriers to 
avoid flying in Belarusian airspace. 
Lufthansa, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines are among the airline companies that have already 
started doing this. 
What effect will the EU's sanctions have on Belarus ?
 But such a move is largely symbolic and does not have any real effect on Lukashenko's politics, according to 
Dzianis Melyantsou of the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations.  
He says the measure could actually make Belarus more dependent on Russia as the restrictions could bankrupt the 
country's state airline — which could then be bought out by Russia. Melyantsou also observed that pro-European 
sentiment among Belarusians gets stronger the more they can travel to the EU. 
"Restrictions that isolate the Belarusian people as opposed to the Belarusian government could turn Belarusians 
against the EU," said Melyantsou. "That's why these rushed decisions won't have any effect." 
Investigation into forced plane diversion 
EU leaders called on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to investigate the plane diversion. The 
ICAO is a specialized UN agency that can issue standards and recommendations, but does not have any regulatory 
power. 
Sanctions on individuals and businesses 
Since October 2020, the EU has progressively been restricting more and more key political figures, including 
President Alexander Lukashenko, with measures like travel bans and asset freezes. They first came as a response 
to Belarus' crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
With the arrest of Pratasevich, the bloc decided to add even more targets to its sanction list of 88 individuals and 
seven entities. 
"There will be additional sanctions on individuals that are involved in the hijacking, but this time also on businesses 
and economic entities that are financing this regime," von der Leyen told reporters. 
According to Pavel Usov, director of the Center for Political Analysis and Prognosis in Warsaw, these measures are 
necessary to signal to Lukashenko that he does not have a carte blanche to treat his citizens any way he wants. But 
in practice, they do not have much of an effect on him. 
"Lukashenko is propagating terror in his country and abroad. In reality, neither sanctions nor international 
agreements will deter him," said Usov. "They won't necessarily lead to a quick change in the country, but these 
measures are imperative." 
Billion-euro economic package is off the table 
Von der Leyen also announced that the EU has a €3 billion ($3.6 billion) investment package ready for Belarus that 
it will now freeze until the country "turns democratic."

 With air-travel demand improving in the United States (particularly for leisure), Southwest Airlines LUV[1] provided 
an upbeat update on average core cash burn for the June quarter. In fact, driven by this better air-travel demand 
scenario, Alaska Air Group ALK[2] too lifted its second-quarter outlook for cash flow from operations. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] was also featured in news, courtesy of its decision to start flying to London later this year. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] announced its intention to start flights on the Teesside (United Kingdom)-
Faro (Portugal) route from Jun 16. This airline too grabbed headlines last week due to its lackluster fiscal fourth-
quarter fiscal 2021 results. The European carrier's fiscal fourth quarter were covered in detail in the previous week's 
writeup[5]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold), expects average core cash burn in the $1-$3 million band per day for the current quarter. The metric was 
$6 million a day in April. The projection is better than the previous estimate of the metric, which was in the $2-4 
million range. Notably, the average core cash burn excludes changes in working capital. The company still expects 
to achieve a breakeven average core cash flow or better in June 2021. Management further stated that operating 
revenues, which declined approximately 42% in April 2021 from its April 2019 levels, improved from the March 
reading owing to better leisure travel demand. The company is also currently witnessing improvements in travel 
demand and bookings for business[6]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank [7](Strong Buy) [8]stocks here. 
2. JetBlue intends to start operating daily flights from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to London's 
Heathrow Airport from Aug 11, 2021 and to London's Gatwick Airport on Sep 29, 2021. However, the airline's 
highly-awaited service between Boston Airport and London is delayed. Service on that route will commence in 
summer 2022[9]. 
3. Management at Alaska Air expects cash flow from operations for the June quarter in the $550-$650 million 
range. This represents an improvement from the previous expectation in the $450-$550 million band. Further, 
management stated that better-than-expected cash inflows from the carrier's affinity card partner and its receipt of 
additional funds, courtesy of the second round of the Payroll Support Program, also contributed to this bullish cash 
flow projection. However, the company still expects second-quarter 2021 revenues to decline in the 32-37% band 
from the figure reported in second-quarter 2019. Capacity projection for the June quarter is also reaffirmed at a 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV Gives Bullish Cash Burn Q2 Update, ALK , JBLU in Focus
roughly 20% decline from its second-quarter 2019 actuals. Load factor view (% of seats filled with passengers) is 
retained in the 70-75% band. 
4.Following the United Kingdom's green list announcement, which allows England residents to visit certain 
countries (including Portugal) without having to quarantine on their return, Ryanair aims to start operating flights 
from Teesside to Faro, Portugal as part of its UK Summer 2021 Schedule. From Teesside, the carrier intends to 
begin services to Alicante and Palma de Mallorca in Spain this June, and to Corfu, Greece in July.[10] 
5. Delta Air Lines DAL[11] expands operation to Iceland with a second flight launched recently, which connects 
Boston, MA with Reykjavik. Earlier this month, the airline resumed its daily service to Iceland from New York-JFK 
after the country reopened its borders to U.S. travelers. 
Amy Martin, Delta's managing director, International Network Planning, stated, 'As the first European country to 
reopen to U.S. tourists, we've seen increased demand for travel to Iceland this summer versus 2019.' In response 
to this demand uptick, the carrier will begin a third flight to Iceland from Minneapolis, MN this week[12]. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during

 WASHINGTON - Airlines re-routed flights to avoid Belarusian airspace Tuesday in the aftermath of the Minsk 
government forcing down a passenger jet and arresting an opposition blogger critical of authoritarian President 
Alexander Lukashenko. 
Lufthansa, KLM, SAS, Air France, LOT and Singapore Airlines were among carriers that stopped flying over 
Belarus along a major Europe-to-Asia corridor that generates hard currency payments to the Minsk government, 
$300 to $940 per flight. 
Belgium's Charles Michel, who chairs European Union summits, called the flight bans, "Europe in action," tweeting 
a picture of a flight tracker map showing no planes flying over Belarus. 
Belarusian planes also faced a possible ban from flying to European Union cities, which could leave landlocked 
Belarus only able to reach its territory via its eastern border with its close ally Russia.

Belarus. (Courtesy: FLIGHTRADAR24.COM/Handout) Lukashenko used the purported threat of a bomb Sunday 
aboard a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, to force the jetliner to land in Minsk. Belarusian authorities 
then arrested blogger Raman Pratasevich, accusing him of inciting massive rallies last summer against 
Lukashenko's assertion of a landslide victory in last August's election, in which he won a sixth term as the country's 
leader with a claimed 80% of the vote. 
A video released overnight showed the 26-year-old Pratasevich confessing to having organized anti-government 
demonstrations.

"I can state that I don't have any health issues, including diseases of the heart or any other organs. Police officers 
are treating me properly and according to the law," he says, adding that he had "confessed to organizing mass 
protests in Minsk." 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the video "concerning" and described the forced landing of the passenger 
jet as "an unprecedented and unacceptable act." 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, among other world leaders, called the incident "state hijacking," and 
France and Ireland have described it as piracy. 
"If we let this go, tomorrow Alexander Lukashenko will go further and do something even more arrogant, more 
cruel," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement. 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the video of Pratasevich showed he had been 
tortured. 
"He said that he was treated lawfully, but he's clearly beaten and under pressure. There is no doubt that he was 
tortured. He was taken hostage," she told a news conference in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius.

Belarus did not immediately comment on her allegation but has consistently denied abusing the thousands of 
people it has detained. 
Human rights groups have cited hundreds of instances of what they contend are abuse and forced confessions 
resulting from a crackdown on pro-democracy opponents of Lukashenko since last year. 
"The events of Sunday are just another escalation in the strategy of blind repression led by the regime of Mr. 
Lukashenko," French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the French parliament. 
The EU, as well as the United States, called on Lukashenko's government to immediately release Pratasevich.

 The forced landing of a passenger flight in Belarus and the subsequent arrest of a dissident has sparked backlash 
across 
the 
continent. 
Belarus' 
opposition 
has 
called 
for 
tougher 
measures 
against 
Lukashenko's 
government.Several European airlines announced on Tuesday that they are suspending flights over Belarus after 
Minsk forced a Ryanair jet to land to arrest a dissident journalist. 
European Union leaders had urged airlines to avoid Belarus' airspace as they imposed sanctions against the 
government of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko. 
Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of hijacking the passenger plane during its flight on Sunday, while 
Minsk claimed it was trying to secure the jet after receiving a bomb threat. 
Which airlines are affected? 
Air France said in a statement it had "taken note" of the conclusions of Monday's EU summit and had suspended 
flights over Belarus "until further notice." 
Finland's flag carrier Finnair and Polish airline LOT also said they would stop using Belarusian airspace. 
Germany's Lufthansa, Dutch KLM, Scandinavian SAS and Latvian Air Baltic made similar announcements on 
Monday. 
Singapore Airlines is also rerouting flights "that are bound for Europe to avoid the Belarusian airspace" and will 
continue to "closely monitor the situation," AFP news agency quoted a spokesperson as saying. 
How has the Belarusian opposition reacted? 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Tuesday called on Western leaders to ramp up 
pressure on the Belarus government. 
"The situation with the hijacking of the plane cannot be considered separately from other repressions and flagrant 
violations of human rights in Belarus," Tsikhanouskaya said. 
In a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Tsikhanouskaya "called on the United States to isolate the 
regime and pressure it through sanctions," she said on Twitter. 
The opposition figure also said that she asked for the Belarusian opposition to be invited to next month's G7 summit 
in Britain. 
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added. 
How have world powers responded so far? 
Belarus : European airlines halt flights amid outrage over plane arrest
The United Nations rights office demanded the immediate release of 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, the 
Belarusian activist journalist who was detained after the plane landed on Sunday.  
"We are shocked by the unlawful arrest and arbitrary detention," spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in 
Geneva.  
"The manner, through threat of military force, in which Protasevich was abducted from the jurisdiction of another 
state and brought within that of Belarus, was tantamount to an extraordinary rendition." 
The EU has since banned Belarusian carriers from flying over the bloc's airspace. The bloc also called for the 
release of Pratasevich.  
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the EU sanctions, adding that the "forced landing of a 
passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous." 
US President Joe Biden said his administration was looking into "appropriate options to hold accountable those 
responsible, in close coordination with the European Union." 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the Belarusian government's account of the incident as "completely 
implausible." 
What has Belarus said?  
Belarus, which said it stopped the plane over a security threat, claimed Western countries were making "unfounded 
accusations" about the event for political reasons. 
On Tuesday, Belarus said it had invited European, US and international aviation officials to investigate the incident. 
Russia, an ally of Belarus, has defended Minsk's handling of the crisis.

 Belarus on Sunday diverted a Ryanair plane and arrested a journalist who was onboard. Roman Protasevich, 26, 
fled to Poland in 2019 and is accused of terrorism in Belarus. Ryanair's CEO said Monday that Belarusian KGB 
agents were on the plane during the forced landing. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Belarusian KGB agents were onboard the Ryanair plane that was abruptly diverted so a dissident journalist could 
be arrested, the airline's CEO said Monday. 
On Sunday, Belarus forced a Ryanair plane that was flying from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania[2], to land in 
Minsk after local air traffic control informed the pilots of a potential bomb threat. 
Once on the ground, authorities found no security threat on board, but Belarusian police entered the plane and 
arrested a passenger, the 26-year-old journalist Roman Protasevich. 
Protasevich is one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics. He had been living in Poland 
since 2019 over fears for his safety, and has continued to criticize Lukashenko from afar. 
Lukashenko personally deployed a MiG-29 fighter jet to escort the plane to Minsk, according to his office[3].  
Appearing on Ireland's Newstalk Breakfast on Monday[4], Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary called the grounding "a 
case of state-sponsored hijacking" in which "the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist." 
O'Leary went on to say that he believed that agents from the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, 
known as the KGB, were onboard the plane when it took off from Athens. 
"We believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport [in Minsk] as well," he said. 
Ryanair did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. 
World leaders have slammed Lukashenko for what they say is a brazen kidnapping attempt and human-rights 
violation. 
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tweeted[5] Sunday that the US condemned the "brazen and shocking act" and 
Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said Sunday[6] that "the incident will not remain without 
consequences." 
In contrast to O'Leary's comments on Monday, Ryanair's initial statement on the grounding, issued on Sunday, 
made no mention of the bogus security threat or Protasevich's arrest. -Ryanair Press Office (@RyanairPress) May 
Belarus had KGB agents on the passenger plane that was diverted to arrest a dissident journalist, Ryanair CEO 
says
23, 2021[7] Insider has contacted Ryanair for comment. 'Europe's last dictator' Lukashenko has been in power in 
Belarus since 1994, and was recently accused of manipulating the results of last year's election[8] in his favor. He 
has long been called "Europe's Last Dictator." 
His office said[9] at the time that he had won just over 80% of the vote, but EU foreign minister Josep Borrell 
said[10] the election was "neither free nor fair."  
Since the election, Lukashenko's administration has cracked down on opposition[11], limited access to the 
internet[12], shut down independent media outlets, and jailed activists. 
Belarus has accused Protasevich, who had in the past edited the popular Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, 
of terrorism and provoking riots. 
Last November, the country charged him with inciting public disorder and social hatred, which if convicted could 
lead to 12 years in prison, The New York Times reported[13]. 
After the plane was diverted to Minsk on Sunday, Protasevich told fellow passengers that he was "facing the death 
penalty," Lithuanian news site Delfi News reported[14]. 
The Belarusian KGB has included Protasevich on a list of terrorists, The Times reported. If he is convicted of 
terrorism, he could face the death penalty. Read the original article on Business Insider[15]

 The EU urged a probe after a Ryanair passenger jet was forced to land in Minsk — in an apparent bid to arrest an 
activist blogger on board. EU leaders are set to discuss additional sanctions against Belarus.Top EU diplomat 
Josep Borrell on Monday called for an international investigation after Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger jet to 
land in Minsk, in an apparent effort to arrest an activist journalist. 
"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardized the safety of passengers and crew," 
Borrell said in a statement issued on Monday. 
"An international investigation into this incident must be carried out to ascertain any breach of international aviation 
rules," the statement went on. 
The Belarusian Transport Ministry on Monday announced it had set up a commission to carry out its own 
investigation into the forced landing and would publish the results soon, according to a report by the Russian RIA 
news agency. 
EU to discuss incident at summit 
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said EU leaders will discuss the incident at an EU summit 
beginning on Monday, adding that the affair would not remain "without consequences." 
He called on the Belarusian authorities to immediately release the detained passenger. 
An EU spokesman said the leaders would discuss "possible sanctions" on Belarus. High-level officials in the 
country have already been sanctioned by the bloc over the brutal repression of the opposition, protesters and 
journalists following disputed elections in August 2020.  
What happened? 
On Sunday, a Ryanair jet flying from Athens to Lithuania was intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and diverted to 
Minsk International Airport after being told a bomb was on board. 
No explosives were found on the aircraft, but Raman Pratasevich, a former editor from the Minsk-critical Telegraph 
outlet Nexta, was allegedly taken into custody. Pratasevich is a known critic of Belarus' long-time leader Alexander 
Lukashenko and his government. 
After hours of delays, the plane was later allowed to fly on to Lithuania — but at least four people, including 
Pratasevich's girlfriend, did not reboard the plane. 
What does Ryanair say? 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told Irish radio station Newstalk that the forced landing "was a case of state-
sponsored hijacking ... state-sponsored piracy" carried out to detain a dissident journalist.

O'Leary said his company believed that some Belarusian secret service agents had been on the plane as well. 
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney echoed O'Leary's remarks, calling the incident "aviation piracy, state-
sponsored." 
He told state broadcaster RTE that sanctions on Belarus with a "real edge" were needed in response.  
The low-cost airline Ryanair is headquartered in the Irish capital, Dublin.

May 24, 2021( Nieman Journalism Lab: http://www.niemanlab.org/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 One consequence of the internet's aversion to international borders has been a recognition that one nation's laws 
restricting basic freedoms can have global effects. When China blocks an American social network, it is restricting 
both what its citizens hear from elsewhere and what the rest of the world hears from Chinese citizens. When Egypt 
tried to turn off the Internet[1] during the Arab Spring, it limited the flow of information but also helped make the 
country's citizens an international cause clbre. When the Indian government orders Twitter to remove a few 
tweets[2] critical of its Covid response, it also makes those 280 characters into[3] a[4] global[5] story[6]. 
 But long before the internet, there was another shared-but-contested space beset by conflicting interests: the air 
itself. Like the Moon[7], the oceans[8], and Antarctica[9], the airspace above us all[10] is both national and 
universal, our birthright as humans and a militarized, commercialized arena for the powerful. And it was that old 
shared space that prompted a significant threat to press freedom this weekend. 
 On Sunday, the autocratic president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, ordered a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair 
passenger plane[11] flying in Belarusian airspace and force it to land at the capital, Minsk. The commercial flight, 
originally a nonstop from Athens to Vilnius, was carrying a journalist and dissident named Roman Protasevich[12], 
26, whose criticism of the Belarusian government was a burr in its saddle. Once grounded, Protasevich was 
removed from the plane and jailed; he could now face the death penalty under Lukashenko's dictatorship. 
 Belarus banned most non-Lukashenko-supporting media outlets last fall amid protests, but Protasevich's online 
platforms — he co-founded the NEXTA channel[13] on Telegram that's become a hub for regime opponents — 
remained a target. (Here's a piece[14] on the channel — 'the most popular dissident media outlet in Belarus' — 
from Rest of World last fall.) 
 The western world has thus far been united in its opposition[15], with several countries ordering their airlines to 
avoid Belarus airspace and some blocking Belarusian flights from landing in their countries. Greek's foreign ministry 
called it a 'state hijacking[16].' 
 Airspace issues such as this one are governed by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation[17], and 
the agency that oversees such matters believes the forced landing may have violated it. 
A 'state hijacking' in Belarus shows how far its autocratic regime will go to stop dissident journalists
ICAO is strongly concerned by the apparent forced landing of a Ryanair flight and its passengers, which could be in 
contravention of the Chicago Convention. We look forward to more information being officially confirmed by the 
countries and operators concerned. 
 — ICAO (@icao) May 23, 2021[18] 
 The convention seems to give countries somewhat greater leeway[19] in their actions in their airspace when there 
is a threat to 'public safety,' including requiring an aircraft 'to effect a landing as soon as practicablewithin its 
territory.' That quest for wiggle room may be why Belarusian officials used a ginned-up bomb threat as their excuse 
to bring down the plane. 
 But it's possible the Streisand Effect[20] also applies to the atmosphere, not just the blogosphere: Lukashenko's 
attempt to silence a voice has instead driven more attention to it. Belarus is currently prominent on the homepages 
of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, El Pais, Le Monde, the BBC, and a host of other 
outlets that are typically happy to let Belorusian headlines drift quietly into the archives. Sanctions are being 
imposed[21] or planned[22]. 
 Time will tell whether Belarus' dictator finds this, in the end, to have been a bee's nest worth disturbing. In the 
meantime, though, a new tactic has just been laid out for autocratic regimes looking to stifle dissent or target 
journalists. In a shared space like the air — or the internet — freedom is hardly guaranteed to win out, no matter 
how idealistic its conventions.

 I'm an avid reader and quite a few years back, I read anovel by John J. Nance[1]that described an attempt by 
international authorities to arrest a former American president for alleged war crimes as he traveled through Europe 
on an airliner. Truth can be stranger than fiction and Nance's scenario played out in the real world yesterday as w 
Belorussian MiG-29 jet fighter forced an airliner down so that authorities could arrest a journalist critical of the 
regime. 
Raman Pratasevich, a vocal critic of the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, was on board Ryanair flight 4978from 
Athens, Greece to Vilnius, Lithuania when it suddenly made a sharp turn to the east and landed in Minsk 
instead.CNN[2]reports that after the plane landed. Pratasevich was arrested. About seven hours later, the plane 
departed Minsk one passenger short. 
Exactly why the plane diverted is the subject of debate. Belorussian authorities claim that the crew made a 
precautionary landing in Minsk after being notified of a bomb threat. Ryanair claims the plane was 'notified by 
Belarus ATC [air traffic control] of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest 
airport, Minsk." Both sides agree that Belorus dispatched a Mig-29 to escort the airliner to Minsk, although Belorus 
claims that the jet fighter was present to monitor the situation and assist if necessary. Franak Viačorka

Pratasevich away. Franak Viačorka @franakviacorkaRaman Pratasevich is a Belarusian journalist and @belamova 
editor. He actively covered the events of the 2020 election campaign and the subsequent protests. Belarusian 
security forces started several criminal cases against him, the KGB put him on the terrorist list. May 23rd 2021 
1,056 Retweets2,618 Likes[7] Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, a former Soviet republic in eastern 
Europe, has been in office since 1994. Since he took office, Lukashenko has extended the presidential term and 
delayed elections. The last candidate to oppose Lukashenko is in exile in Lithuania. As a founding member of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Belorus has close relations with Putin's Russia.; 
Intercepting an international airline flight to arrest a political opponent is unprecedented as far as I can tell. The only 
incident that I can recall that is remotely similar was in 1985 whenUS Navy F-14 Tomcats intercepted an Egyptair 
737[8]that was carrying four terrorists who had hijacked theAchille Laurocruise ship and killed an American citizen, 
Leon Klinghoffer. Mohammed Abbas, a Palestine Liberation Front member, and several PLO officials were also on 
the plane. The Navy fighters forced the airliner down at a NATO airbase in Sicily and turned the terrorists over to 
Italian authorities. 
Lukashenko's actions are violations of international law and the ChicagoConvention on International Civil 
Aviation[9]which guarantees the right to overfly countries without landing. Forcing down an airliner with a jet fighter 
to arrest a passenger is a naked act of air piracy and kidnapping. 
If Lukashenko's actions are allowed to go unchallenged, it might very well be the end of international air travel as 
we know it as theSaudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi[10]may have inspired Lukashenko. If one dictator can pull off 
such a brazen act, others will certainly try. Passengers with political enemies would have to consider how close 
their flights would be to countries where they were persona non grata. Airlines might have to screen passenger 
manifests for controversial passengers that could provoke an interception. Ultimately, attempts to intercept and 
divert airliners could lead to shooting on either small or large scales. 
Although the United States is not directly involved in the incident, both political parties seem to be united in 
opposition to Lukashenko's shocking action. Julie Fisher, President Biden's new ambassador to Belorus called the 
interception 'dangerous and abhorrent' in atweet[11]. Julie Fisher @USAmbBelarusLukashenka and his regime 
today showed again its contempt for international community and its citizens. Faking a bomb threat and sending 
MiG-29s to force @Ryanair to Minsk in order to arrest a @nexta journalist on politically motivated charges is 
dangerous and abhorrent. May 23rd 2021 598 Retweets1,685 Likes[12] Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the senior 
Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the act 'an egregious affront to democratic societies' 
and said that Lukashenko 'cannot go unpunished.' House Foreign Affairs GOP @HouseForeignGOP"To force an 
Irish aircraft with nearly 200 innocent civilians to land in order to make that arrest is an egregious affront to 
democratic societies around the world. The Belarusian dictator and those who continue to support him cannot go 
unpunished. May 23rd 2021 12 Retweets24 Likes[13] What the West can do to punish Lukashenko is the question. 
Sanctions are an obvious answer, but may be of limited use since most of Belarus's trade is with Russia. This is 
especially true since the US, Canada, and Europe have alreadytargeted the country and many of its officials with 
sanctions and asset freezes[14]in retaliation for the regime rigging an election last year. The good news is most 
countries that aren't Russia are lining up to demand an explanation from Lukashenko. 
Whatever happens in the coming days, the world should hold Lukashenko responsible for the safety of Raman 
Pratasevich. If the journalist is not released unharmed, Lukashenko and Belarus should be isolated and 
impoverished. Doing so may require further isolating Russia as well. 
In the US, we take many things for granted. Safe air travel and freedom from arrest for political reasons are two big 
ones. It's difficult for most of us to fully comprehend how a flight of an hour or two across Europe, Asia, or Africa 
can cross a number of dictatorial regimes and even run the risk of being shot down likeMalaysia Airlines Flight 
17[15]in 2014. We complain about the other party, but in reality, we know we don't have to worry about being 
arrested, tortured, and murdered for our political views. 
Alexander Lukashenko's decision to risk the lives of almost 200 Ryanair passengers and crew to arrest a political 
opponent is a reminder that there are still very bad and dangerous people in the world who will push the boundaries 
of international law to the brink of war in order to ensure the survival of their regime. Sometimes a backwater 
dictator's actions are so blatant and dangerous that they cannot be ignored by the world. 
This is one of those times.

 The EU moved to isolate Belarus after the government diverted a flight to arrest a journalist. Roman Protasevich 
was on the Ryanair flight when it landed in Minsk due to a bogus security threat. The bloc ordered EU-based 
airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banned Belarusian airlines from its airspace and airports. See more 
stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The European Union moved to isolate Belarus in light of the arrest of a journalist who was arrested after the 
government diverted a Ryanair flight on Sunday. 
The EU ordered all EU-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banned Belarusian airlines from entering 
EU airspace and landing in its airports. The move was announced Monday during a summit of European Union 
leaders in Brussels. 
Journalist Roman Protasevich[2] was taken into custody after the Lithuania-bound flight he was aboard was 
grounded in Minsk due to a bogus security threat[3]. Protasevich is a vocal critic of Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko, who gave an "unequivocal order" to ground the Ryanair jet in Minsk, according to state media. 
Protasevich's arrest drew international outrage[4] as EU leaders condemned the forced grounding of the flight and 
called for the "immediate release" of Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega[5], who was also escorted off the 
flight. World leaders also demanded "their freedom of movement be guaranteed." 
Read more: Don't let Ryanair ignore your right not to be kidnapped[6] 
Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union's European Commission, said the "outrageous and illegal 
behavior of the regime in Belarus will have consequences." 
"Those responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned," von der Leyen said in a statement[7] on Twitter. 
"Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately." 
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also called the incident an "unprecedented act of state terrorism." 
"Hijacking of a civilian plane is an unprecedented act of state terrorism. It cannot go unpunished," Morawiecki said 
in a statement[8], adding that he would petition[9] for sanctions against Belarus in light of Protasevich's arrest. 
At the Brussels summit, Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, described the incident as "madness," 
according to a report by The New York Times[10]. 
"It's like something out of a very bad movie," Bettel said. "It shows the state of the regime." 
The EU moves to isolate Belarus after the government diverted a flight carrying a Belarusian dissident
EU officials said few raised objections to the move to avoid Belarusian airspace - a rare occurrence as the bloc 
does not tend to come to a consensus on controversial issues so quickly and easily, The Times reported. Read the

Why Lukashenko diverted a plane to catch Belarusian blogger

 The forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk has resulted in the imprisonment of a dissident journalist. The 
president has raised the stakes on reporting in Belarus, a colleague of the arrested journalist writes.On Sunday, 
authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. When it became 
clear that the aircraft was being diverted, one passenger's reaction stood out.  
A young man grabbed his head in panic. Once the plane landed, passengers left the plane and their belongings 
were checked. Security forces approached the man. He felt calmer but was still trembling. Shortly before they took 
him away in an unknown direction, he told people who were around: "A death penalty awaits me here." 
It was Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian blogger and journalist. He knew that his unexpected visit to 
Belarus meant a certain arrest, because he is on a terrorist watch list drawn up by the State Security Committee, 
still known as the KGB. 
'Potential security threat' 
Pratasevich was on his way back from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, where he is based. Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered a MiG-29 jet fighter to escort the civilian plane to the Minsk airport. In a 
statement, Ryanair said the crew had been "notified by Belarus Air Traffic Control of a potential security threat on 
board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk." 
The journalist had left Belarus for Poland in 2019 in fear of arrest. From there, he worked as the editor-in-chief of 
the influential Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, which became the main source of information about 
protests when the internet was shut down after the disputed presidential election in August. 
Since November, Pratasevich — like Nexta founder Stsiapan Putsila — has been on the government's list of more 
than 700 "individuals involved in terrorist activities." 
Lukashenko targets press 
With most opposition leaders having left Belarus, Nexta has played a key role in spreading information, posting 
updates, giving the time and location of rallies, and revealing facts about police brutality. Lukashenko, who has 
ruled Belarus since 1994, has accused social media and independent journalists of being responsible for organizing 
and coordinating mass opposition rallies. 
When asked if he was afraid that Lukashenko's agents might get to him in Poland, Pratasevich said he was in the 
process of obtaining refugee status and would not be deported. A request for Raman's extradition had previously 
been sent by the Belarusian authorities to Poland's government, which did not comply. 
Why Lukashenko diverted a plane to catch Belarusian blogger
Four prominent activists who are members of the Polish minority in Belarus were arrested — including the 
community leaders Andzelika Borys and Andrzej Poczobut. They were charged with breaching rules on mass 
gatherings during an annual folk fair, as well as inciting national and religious hatred, a charge punishable with a 
prison sentence of up to 12 years. The arrests have been accompanied by anti-Polish propaganda on state TV. 
The regime launched a war on journalists and bloggers in Belarus months before last summer's election. In June, 
Ihar Losik, a consultant for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the founder of another influential 
Telegram channel, Belarus of the Brain, was detained. Since then, the already dire situation has worsened. 
Raid on tut.by 
On May 18, security services raided the offices of tut.by, the largest media outlet in Belarus, as well as apartments 
of the website's journalists. The portal's editor-in-chief, Maryna Zolatava, and other journalists were arrested. 
For over 20 years, tut.by has been popular among Belarusians, no matter their political views. Lukashenko's 
officials read tut.by, and so did his opponents. The website's reach set a record high in May — right before it was 
blocked — with its monthly unique users hitting 3.3 million, or 63% of Belarusian internet users.  
Dozens of independent news portals have already been blocked, hundreds of journalists were arrested or detained, 
and a number of newspapers have stopped being printed. But this was not enough. Lukashenko has continually 
raised the stakes of reporting in Belarus. 
Pratasevich's trumped-up charges 
Pratasevich is facing charges on at least three criminal counts. One of them is on "plotting mass riots," which is 
punishable by up to 15 years in prison. There haven't been any accusations yet publicly made related to the 
allegations of his "terrorist' activities. But, as he is most probably being held in the KGB prison in Minsk, a lawyer 
was not allowed to see him. There is practically no information as to his health and the conditions in which he is 
being held. 
At the time of his arrest, Pratasevich was working for Losik's Belarus of the Brain. Both are my friends. Although 
they have different personalities — Ihar is a quiet introvert while Raman is a loud extrovert — they share many 
similarities. Both were on the radar of Belarusian law enforcement since at least 2011, when they were involved in 
the so-called Revolution Through Social Networks in Minsk and other cities. Both were awarded a Vaclav Havel 
Journalism Fellowship at RFE/RL. Both are now jailed. 
Bloggers became the first target for Lukashenko, who wants to silence the dissent. He must believe that it is 
technology — not his rule, human rights violations and the widespread poverty in Belarus — that brought people to 
the streets. So far, he has fought his opponents within Belarus. On Sunday, he proved that there are no bounds for 
his repressions.

 Belarus moved first, expelling all staff at Latvia's embassy in protest at opposition flags being hoisted at an ice 
hockey tournament. Minsk is currently the focus of outrage over its forced landing of a passenger jet.Belarusian 
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei on Monday said the entire Latvian embassy in Minsk had been asked to leave the 
country by midweek. 
The decision was in response to Latvian authorities raising Belarusian opposition flags at an ice hockey 
championship. 
The Latvian officials apparently hoisted the flags in a show of solidarity amid international outrage over Belarus' 
forced landing of a passenger jet on Sunday. 
'Insulting the national flag' 
Makei said Belarus was expelling the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, including the ambassador. 
The minister said Latvia's ambassador, Einars Semanis, had been summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday 
and given 24 hours to leave. 
According the state-run news agency Belta, Makei said the summons was for "insulting the national flag." 
"A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador in connection with the situation," Belta quoted Makei as saying. 
The rest of the embassy staff were given 48 hours to leave, with one member of the administrative staff allowed to 
remain to look after the building. 
Latvia responded soon afterward with the reciprocal expulsions of Belarusian diplomats. 
One nation, two sets of colors 
The switch of flags took place at the 2021 Ice Hockey World Championship, which Belarus had been due to cohost. 
Belarus was excluded from its role in the tournament over "security concerns," and Riga was named the sole host. 
The organizers raised the opposition's red-and-white flag — a symbol of the short-lived Belarusian National 
Republic in 1918 that has become a rallying point for opponents of Lukashenko. The flag was readopted in 1991 
when Belarus won independence from Moscow, but done away with in 1994 when Lukashenko came to power. 
Belarus' current official red-green flag includes and embroidered pattern and dates back to 1951, when the country 
was still part of the Soviet Union. 
International outrage over forced landing 
The change of flags came as Belarus came under fire from European leaders for forcing a Ryanair passenger flight 
from Greece to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, to land in Minsk on Sunday. 
Belarus and Latvia expel diplomats in ice hockey flag furor
Belarusian officials then swooped on the plane to detain blogger journalist and opposition activist Raman 
Pratasevich. 
The arrest was the boldest in a series of moves by Lukashenko's government to crack down on opposition figures 
and members of the press. 
The campaign targeting opposition and independent media follows mass protests against Lukashenko. The 
longtime leader was re-elected for a sixth term in a disputed election in August 2020. 
More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since August, with thousands of protesters beaten by 
security forces.

 European leaders are vowing to punish Belarus for illegally diverting to Minsk Sunday a Lithuanian-bound Ryanair 
flight carrying a fugitive critic of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. 
Their fury was fueled as more details emerged Monday of the dramatic events leading up to the diversion of the 
plane. The Ryanair Boeing 737 was carrying 171 passengers and crew had taken off from Athens and was flying 
over Belarus. It was just moments from leaving Belarusian air space when the captain was signaled by the pilot of a 
Belarus MiG-29 jet to land in the Belarus capital and not to proceed to the scheduled destination, Vilnius, 
Lithuania's capital.

Belarus authorities, after it landed at Vilnius Airport, May 23, 2021. When the plane landed in Minsk, Belarusian 
security service officers detained 26-year-old opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich, who could face a death 
sentence on charges of helping to organize protests against President Lukashenko. Just before the aircraft landed, 
he gave his laptop and cell phone to a friend for safekeeping, passengers told reporters in Vilnius.  
Pratasevich's girlfriend, Sofia, was also detained. And reports emerged Monday of another detainee.  
The plan to seize Pratasevich, who has lived in exile since 2019, also appears to have involved the participation of 
Belarusian KGB agents, who were present at the departure airport at Athens and boarded the jet, according to 
opposition activists.

Opposition blogger and activist Raman Pratasevich, who is accused of participating in an unsanctioned protest at 
the Kuropaty preserve, arrives for a court hearing in Minsk, Belarus, Apr. 10, 2017. The Greek Foreign Ministry 
EU Fury Mounts After Belarus Forces Plane Carrying Fugitive Journalist to Land
released a statement Sunday describing the forced landing as a 'state hijacking' which 'put the lives of all the 
passengers on board in danger.' That view was echoed by US. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who dubbed the 
illegal diversion in a statement as 'a shocking act.'  
Blinken said the 'regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including US citizens. Initial reports 
suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort 
the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation,' he added.  
Fight onboard 
In an online post before leaving Athens, Pratasevich said he was being trailed by KGB agents. 'This was some 
suspicious crap,' he wrote. 'When the plane entered Belarus airspace KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair 
crew, insisting that there was an improvised explosive device onboard,' Tadeusz Giczan, an editor at the activist 
Telegram site Nexta, tweeted.  
'Eventually the crew was forced to send out an SOS, literally moments before the plane would have left Belarusian 
airspace. A MiG-29 took off and escorted it to Minsk,' he said. There were also local reports that an Mi-24 helicopter 
gunship was used in the operation. 
Ryanair said in a statement that the crew was also told by Belarus aviation authorities of a 'potential security threat 
on board' and ordered the plane to Minsk, even though Vilnius was nearer. On landing, all the passengers were 
searched and the flight was allowed to resume its journey five hours later. 
Rynair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, also said he believes that Belarus KGB agents were on board the flight. In an 
interview Monday with a British radio broadcaster, he said: 'It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a 
journalist and his traveling companion. We believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well.' 
On Monday, it also emerged that along with Pratasevich and his girlfriend, a Russian citizen studying at the 
European Humanities University, EHU, in Lithuania, was forced off the flight, too. EHU has demanded her release, 
saying she was detained by the Minsk Investigative Committee on 'groundless and made-up conditions.'  
EU response 
EU leaders will discuss the case at a summit Monday, European Council President Charles Michel. 'The incident 
will not remain without consequences,' he added in a statement.  
'Possible sanctions' would be on the table, his spokesperson said. They could include barring Belarusian airlines 
from over-flying EU states or landing at the bloc's airports and suspending all flights of EU airlines through 
Belarusian airspace. Ground transit from Belarus into the EU could also be prohibited, say EU officials.

two were Russians, prompting speculation in the Belarus opposition media that they may have been Russian 
intelligence officers.

 Belarus shared video of a journalist detained after the government hijacked a passenger flight. KGB agents 
arrested Roman Protasevich, a critic of President Alexander Lukashenko, Monday. Protasevich said authorities 
treated him "correctly" and "lawfully" as he was taken into custody. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Belarusian authorities posted a video of the journalist arrested Monday after the government hijacked a flight. 
A passenger plane en route from Athens to Lithuania landed in Minsk, Belarus, after air-traffic operators were 
warned of a bogus security threat. Pilots on flight FR4978 were ordered to "divert to the nearest airport," citing a 
potential bomb threat aboard the plane. 
KGB agents boarded the aircraft soon after and did not find the security threat. They arrested journalist Roman 
Protasevich[2], who has been publicly critical of the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko's rule. 
Belarusian state media reported it was Lukashenko who gave an "unequivocal order" to ground the jet in Minsk, 
despite data on Flightradar.com[3] showing the plane made a sharp U-turn to land in Belarus, as it was closer to its 
destination in Lithuania than Minsk, Insider's Cheryl Teh[4] reported. 
In the government video reposted by the Minsk-based reporter Hanna Liubakova[5] later Monday, Protasevich 
confirmed he was detained by authorities at Minsk National Airport by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He said he 
currently has "no health concerns" and said he was treated "correctly" and "lawfully" when taken into custody. 
Protasevich said he was cooperating with authorities and continues to "provide evidence related to the mass rallies 
in Minsk," according to a translation by Insider. -Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) May 24, 2021[6] However, 
eyewitnesses said Protasevich expressed fear and told other passengers on the plane he was "facing the death 
penalty" as state authorities hijacked the plane to take him into custody, passenger Monika Simkiene told AFP[7] 
reporter Katy Lee. 
"He was not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid. It looked like if the window had been open, 
he would have jumped out of it," passenger Edvinas Dimsa told Lee. 
Protasevich's arrest drew international outrage, including from Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union's 
executive European Commission, who said the "outrageous and illegal behavior of the regime in Belarus will have 
consequences."

"Those responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned," von der Leyen said in a statement[8] on Twitter. 
"Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately." 
Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also called the incident an "unprecedented act of state terrorism." 
"Hijacking of a civilian plane is an unprecedented act of state terrorism. It cannot go unpunished,"Morawiecki said in 
a statement[9], adding that he would petition[10] for sanctions against Belarus in light of Protasevich's arrest.

 The Ryanair plane was en route to Vilnius when it was diverted to Minsk. The opposition says the move was a bid 
to arrest a journalist on board who is critical of Lukashenko's government.A Belarusian journalist and opposition 
activist is being held at an airport in Minsk after his Lithuania-bound flight was forced to land, opposition politicians 
and outlets reported on Sunday. 
Opposition figures swiftly criticized the move, which they said was a bid by the government of longtime leader 
Alexander Lukashenko to clamp down on critical voices. 
The official Belta news agency reported that a plane had been diverted, but did not mention whether an arrest had 
taken place. 
What we know so far 
A Ryanair flight traveling from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania was diverted to land in Belarus, the flight tracking site 
Flightradar24 reported. 
The Belta news agency reported that the plane had been diverted to Minsk International Airport for an emergency 
landing due.  
An airport spokesperson told the agency that although authorities did not find any explosive devices on the plane, it 
was unclear when it would be allowed to take off again. 
The opposition Telegram channel Nexta also reported that the plane was searched and that authorities detained the 
outlet's former editor, Roman Protasevich. 
"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," said 
Nexta. "Among them was... Nexta journalist Roman Protasevich. He was detained." 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya described Pratasevich as a "journalist, photographer, blogger 
and activist," saying he "faces the death penalty" in Belarus. 
The Belarusian government has yet to comment.

 The German Foreign Ministry has demanded that Belarus explain the diversion of a Lithuania-bound flight, and the 
detention of a journalist onboard. EU leaders expressed shock and said Minsk would be held accountable.Berlin on 
Sunday demanded an explanation from the Belarusian government after military jets forced a Ryanair passenger 
plane to land in the capital, Minsk. 
The German Foreign Ministry also said answers were needed about the alleged arrest of a former editor from the 
Minsk-critical news outlet Nexta.  
The blogger Roman Protasevich was on the Athens-to-Vilnius Ryanair flight when a fighter jet intercepted the 
plane's path. 
The passenger plane's crew asked for permission to land, and Protasevich — who has been critical of President 
Alexander Lukashenko — was reportedly detained. 
'Immediate explanation' required 
"We need an immediate explanation by the government of Belarus on the diversion of a Ryanair flight within the EU 
to Minsk and the alleged detention of a journalist," the German Foreign Ministry's state secretary Miguel Berger 
wrote on Twitter. 
French Foreign Affairs Minister said the incident was "unacceptable" and called for a "firm and united response." 
Shock from Greece and Lithuania 
Leaders of the flight's departure and destination nations, Greece and Lithuania, were among the first to respond. 
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the events were "unprecedented and shocking." 
"We demand all passengers' immediate release. Tomorrow's #EUCO must address the need to step up pressure 
on Belarus. Enough is enough," Mitsoatakis said in a tweet. 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda slammed the decision to target a civilian aircraft as "unprecedented" and 
"abhorrent." 
Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki condemned the arrests and said he had asked European 
Council President Charles Michel to consider sanctions. He said the actions could not go unpunished. 
Belarus flight: Germany demands explanation of diversion, arrest
"I condemn in the strongest terms the detention of Roman Protasevich by Belarusian authorities after a Ryanair 
passenger aircraft was hijacked. This is a reprehensible act of state terrorism," he said. 
EU chiefs hold Minsk accountable 
Some 171 passengers on board the flight — between two European Union member states — were unable to 
proceed with their journey. 
Bloc officials warned Belarus that it would be held responsible for the fate of the diverted flight, calling for all 
passengers to be released. 
"We hold the government of Belarus responsible for the security of all passengers and the aircraft," EU foreign 
policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted. 
"ALL passengers must be able to continue their travel immediately," he said, appearing to implicitly be demanding 
Protasevich's release. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed this message. 
"ALL passengers must be able to continue their travel to Vilnius immediately and their safety ensured," she said, in 
a separate tweet. "Any violation of international air transport rules must bear consequences," she warned. 
European Council President Charles Michel, who is set to host a summit of 27 EU national leaders on Monday, said 
it was "essential" that the International Civil Aviation Organization investigate.

 Journalist Raman Pratasevich might face the death penalty after Belarusian authorities forced his plane to land in 
Minsk. A passenger on the flight described Pratasevich's reaction.Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian 
national, was "upset" after realizing the Ryanair fllght he was on was unexpectedly landing in Minsk, a witness told 
Radio Free Europe's Belarus department on Sunday. 
"After a sudden turn of the plane, one guy [Pratasevich] started panicking, grabbing his head," the source, another 
passenger on the flight said. "There was no conflict up until the plane turned, no falling out, nothing." 
Belarus claims a bomb scare 
According to pro-government media in Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko himself ordered a MiG-29 fighter 
jet to be scrambled and intercept the Ryanair jet over an alleged bomb scare. No bomb was found on the plane. 
Instead, Belarusian authorities detained the exiled reporter Pratasevich, who had been traveling from Greece to 
Lithuania. Pratesevich faces criminal charges in Belarus, including inciting hatred against the government. He is 
also on the nation's list of "individuals involved in terrorist activity." Belarus opposition leaders say he could face the 
death penalty in his native country. 
Reporter's luggage 'thrown out' onto the runway 
Upon landing in Minsk, security forces took the passengers out and had sniffer dog teams inspect their belongings, 
the passenger told Radio Free Europe. 
Pratasevich's luggage was "thrown out on the runway" and he was taken aside. 
"We asked him what was going on." the passenger said. "He told us who he was and added: 'A death penalty 
awaits me here.' He was a bit calmer, but trembling." 
Eventually, he was taken away by the military, according to the source. 
Pratesevich previously served as the editor-in-chief of opposition news outlet NEXTA, which the Belarus authorities 
have labeled as extremist. 
Pratesevich suspected he was followed in Athens 
In a separate interview to Deutsche Welle, an aide to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Franak Viacorka 
said Pratesevich was in touch with him before boarding the plane and told him he suspected he was being followed. 
"This morning I was in touch with Raman he shared [with me] concerns that someone was following him in Athens 
airport," the politician said. 
NEXTA also shared texts sent out by Pratasevich from Athens, in which he described a suspicious Russian-
speaking man who seemed to try to get a photo of his travel documents. 
Belarus reporter said 'death penalty awaits me here' — witness
"The great thing is, that he was the next in line to get his documents checked, and he just turned and walked away 
at the gate," Pratasevich wrote, describing the man as "middle-aged, built, balding" and carrying a leather suitcase. 
Talking to DW, Viacorka described the 26-year-old reporter as a "personal enemy of Lukashenko," saying that 
Pratesevich was "posting videos and pictures from a protest about torture in prisons, about the conditions in jails. 
He was one of the most prominent figures speaking about the horrible violations of human rights." 
"I think what we saw today, it was their revenge, personal revenge of Lukashenko against Raman and his principled 
position right now," he told DW.

 A Belarusian journalist wanted by the government of Alexander Lukashenko was arrested after the plane he was 
traveling on made an unscheduled landing in Minsk on May 23 after what appears to have been a false bomb 
threat. 
Raman Pratasevich was taken away by police shortly after the Ryanair flight, which was on a scheduled route from 
Athens to Vilnius, landed in the Belarusian capital. 
No bomb was found, according to Belarussian media reports. No further details were immediately available. It was 
unclear who had reported the bomb threat. 
The headquarters of Belarusian opposition leader Svaitlana Tsikhanouskaya reported that the Ryanair flight crew 
received a message about a bomb on board the plane and that a MiG-29 military fighter was dispatched to escort 
the passenger jet to the airport in Minsk. 
Tsikhanouskaya's office said the flight was near the border with Lithuania when the message was received. It was 
closer to the airport in Vilnius but instead it headed to Minsk. 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was an "unprecedented event" that a civilian passenger plane flying 
to Vilnius was forced to land in Minsk. 
"Flag of Belarus regime is behind the abhorrent action. I demand to free Roman Protasevic urgently!" Nauseda said 
on Twitter. 
Pratasevich was a key administrator of the Telegram channel NEXTA Live, which has been covering the protests 
that broke out in Belarus following the country's disputed presidential election last August. 
In November, Belarusian authorities announced that Pratasevich, along with Stsyapan Putsila -- also a NEXTA Live 
administrator -- were being investigated on suspicions of organizing mass disorder, disrupting the social order, and 
inciting social hatred. 
Belarus Journalist Arrested after Flight Diverted to Minsk
Belarus has been rocked by protests since Lukashenka, in power since 1994, was declared the landslide winner of 
the poll amid allegations of vote-rigging. Since then, more than 30,000 people have been detained, hundreds 
beaten or tortured, and journalists targeted in the crackdown by Lukashenka, whose government has been hit by 
Western sanctions. 
In October, a court in Minsk designated the NEXTA Live channel and its logo as extremist and instructed the 
Information Ministry to restrict access to information resources using the name and logo of the Telegram channel, 
as well as their distribution in the Belarusian segment of the Internet. 
NEXTA Live then changed its name and logo, switching from the Latin transliteration of its name to a Cyrillic one. 
Fearing prosecution, Pratasevich and Putsila fled the country and their whereabouts have not been known. 
In October, Putsila, along with several Belarusian activists, received the European Parliament's 2020 Sakharov 
Prize for Freedom of Thought. 
Media in Belarus have been targeted by the Lukashenka government in the ongoing crackdown. The watchdog 
Reporters Without Borders has designated Belarus as the most dangerous spot in Europe for journalists. 
On May 21, Belarusian security forces raided a Minsk studio used by a Polish-based TV station that has produced 
investigations critical of Lukashenka and his associates. 
Belsat said uniformed officers broke into a studio on May 21 used for producing a talk show, detaining six people, 
including four cameramen. 
In April, the channel published an investigation into the business dealings of Lukashenka's daughter-in-law and 
others associated with him. 
Earlier this year, two journalists for Belsat were handed what their lawyers called an "absurd" sentence of two years 
in prison each for reporting live from a rally in Minsk in November. 
Earlier this week, police launched a probe of the country's largest independent online media outlet, Tut.by, 
searching the homes of several of its editors and blocking its website. 
Meanwhile, a Minsk court on May 21 sentenced another reporter who covered the police raid on Tut.by to a 15-day 
prison sentence, a media advocacy group said. 
The Belarusian Association of Journalists said 27 media workers are currently behind bars, either awaiting trial or 
serving sentences.

 https://www.litigationfutures.com/wp-content/uploads/Air-Canada.jpg Air Canada: Liable to pay compensation 
The High Court has given yet another boost to flight delay practices after ruling that a passenger who boarded in 
London but suffered a delay on the second leg of her flight in Canada was entitled to compensation. 
It comes as the Supreme Court today considers a controversial ruling that a law firm handling uncontested flight 
delay claims was not conducting litigation and so did not have an equitable lien over the compensation. 
In Varano v Air Canada [2021] EWHC 1336 (QB)[1], Marjolyn Varano flew with Air Canada from London to Toronto 
and then onwards to Austin, Texas. There were no issues with the first flight, but the second leg was delayed by 
nearly six hours. 
EU flight compensation rules (EU Regulation 261/2004) have been adopted into domestic law post Brexit, but Air 
Canada argued that, as the disrupted flight in question was outside of the EU, the rules did not apply and Ms 
Varano could not claim the €600 due under the regulation. 
Sitting as a deputy High Court judge, Geraint Webb QC disagreed. He found that Regulation 261 'imposed a 
contingent liability on Air Canada when it operated the flight from Heathrow, namely a liability to pay compensation 
to Ms Varano if she experienced relevant delay in respect of arrival at the final destination 
'Contrary to the submissions of Air Canada, the existing case law has held that such an interpretation of Regulation 
261 is not precluded by the territoriality principle.' 
The contingent liability was imposed when the airline was within the jurisdiction, irrespective of its nationality or 
where the delay was caused. 
The case was brought by Hampshire law firm Hayward Baker, which in March also won a Court of Appeal ruling 
that the captain's non-attendance due to illness did not amount to the 'extraordinary circumstance' defence under 
Regulation 261. 
Separately, the European Court of Justice ruled in March that airlines still have to compensate passengers whose 
flights are cancelled or delayed by more than three hours where the disruption was caused by a union-led workers 
strike. 
The Supreme Court is today hearing Cheshire firm Bott &#38; Co's appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision[2] 
in its claim against Ryanair, which was criticised for not giving solicitors credit for being more business-like and 
efficient. 
The case concerned Ryanair dealing directly with the law firm's clients, including paying them compensation. 
High Court boosts flight delay claims at Supreme Court hears Bott case
Bott &#38; Co has led the market in developing a flight delay practice. The process is largely automated unless the 
airline disputes the claim. 
The court said the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, and so did not have an 
equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees due to Bott. 
Nick Bacon QC, representing Bott &#38; Co, told the Supreme Court that a solicitor using technology should be 
treated the same as a 'more sedentary' solicitor in the Home Counties using a typewriter. 
He went on: 'Litigation is heading towards platform-based resolution and the law shouldn't be concerned by the 
ease with which the recoveries may be made Has there been legal input which has resulted in the recovery? That 
should be the focus.' 
The Supreme Court granted permission so it could consider what the limits were to the principle set out in Gavin 
Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21, under which a solicitor can ask the court to 
grant an equitable lien in order to protect their entitlement to fees as against their client.

 The Irish budget carrier, a vocal critic of state bailouts for legacy competitiors, hailed the ruling by judges in 
Luxembourg. It said aid granted to TAP and KLM only succeded in "rewarding inefficiency."Ryanair, the Irish budget 
airline, won two rare EU legal victories on Wednesday in a long-running row over state aid rules. 
It had filed complaints with the bloc's General Court in Luxembourg over subsidies provided to Dutch carrier KLM 
and Portugal's TAP. 
Both airlines were provided with government-backed loans at the height of the coronavirus pandemic that were 
signed off by EU competition officials.

The firm said in a statement that the EU had "reversed the clock" on fair competition by "rewarding inefficiency."

Luxembourg. It said aid granted to TAP and KLM only succeded in "rewarding inefficiency."Ryanair, the Irish budget

May 19, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 (which ended Mar 
31, 2021) due to the coronavirus-induced air-travel demand softness. Notably, total revenues at this European low-
cost carrier plunged 89.2% year over year due to the tepid air traffic. 
Meanwhile, Latin-American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[2] stated that its sales in April improved 75% from the March 
level as air-travel demand rebounds on increased vaccination programs. The scenario in the United States is rosier 
as domestic air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is northbound. Notably, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[3] 
also aims to hire 184 pilots in the coming months[4] to meet this demand swell. 
Anticipating the demand uptick to continue in the summer season, United Airlines UAL[5] intends to boost its 
domestic schedule for July by adding daily flights in excess of 400. On the international front, United Airlines plans 
to add as well as resume some services to European destinations, courtesy of an uptick in demand. Delta Air Lines 
DAL[6] had also provided an expansion update on the international front as reported in the previous week's 
writeup[7]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong 
Sell), posted a wider-than-expected loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to weak revenues. In 
fact, its operations were hurt by coronavirus-induced disruptions throughout fiscal 2021 as exemplified by the 81% 
traffic reduction. In fact, the airline regarded fiscal 2021 as the most 'challenging' in its 35-year history. On a further 
positive note, Ryanair hopes to return to pre-coronavirus levels of growth in summer 2022[8]. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here[9]. 
2. Owing to its decision to boost the domestic network in July, United Airlines expects to operate 80% of its pre-
pandemic U.S. schedule in the month as summer travel bookings rise. On the domestic front, the carrier will add 
services to Bozeman, MT; Orange County, CA; Raleigh, N.C. and Yellowstone/Cody, WY. From Chicago, IL, the 
airline will operate more than 480 daily departures while from Washington D.C. it will operate above 220 daily 
departures. Notably, the Chicago-based carrier will expand its July domestic network by 17% from its June[10] 
level. 
3. Alaska Air Group's ALK[11] subsidiary Alaska Airlines aims to expand its fleet again in response to better 
demand witnessed in the United States. Alaska Airlines expects domestic travel to return to pre-COVID levels by 
the summer of 2022. To meet this anticipated demand uptick, the airline aims to add 17 Embraer 175 jets to the 
regional fleet in 2022 and 2023[12], of which nine will be operated by Horizon Air and eight by SkyWest. 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Q4 Loss, UAL 's Expansion Update & More
4. Mirroring improved air-travel demand, Gol Linhas operated approximately 200 daily flights on peak days and 
covered 67 destinations in April. The carrier's consolidated gross revenues totaled approximately R$250 million in 
the month. Passenger revenue per available seat kilometers or PRASK rose 38% month over month as well as 5% 
year over year on higher ticket pricing owing to dynamic yield management and recovery in travel demand 
compared with April 2020[13]. 
5. Despite the recent improvement, air-travel demand in the United States remains below the pre-coronavirus 
levels. This is reflected in Allegiant's passenger count that showed 20.4% less flyers under its scheduled service in 
April 2021 than April 2019. Scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) also declined 21.6% in the 
month from the April 2019 tally. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service too slid 0.6% 
from the April 2019 reading[14]. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline 
players over the past week and during the last six months. 
The table above shows that all airline stocks barring Copa Holdings CPA[15] have traded in the green in the past 
week, leading the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to gain 2.7% to $106.45. Over the course of the past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 41%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for usual news 
updates in the space. 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to

May 18, 2021( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  A North East airport has 
announced that it is launching a new slate of flights to Portugal following 'strong' sales for other destinations. 
Teesside Airport, in Darlington, has teamed up with Ryanair to launch a new twice-weekly service to Faro in 
Portugal's Algarve region. 
This comes less than two weeks after the country was added to the UK's green list for international travel, meaning 
that passengers will not need to quarantine on arrival back in the UK. The new route is the seventh service that 
Ryanair will be running from Teesside this summer, joining flights to Alicante, Palma and Corfu. Last week, fellow 
North East airport Newcastle International reported [1]that it would be starting flights to Portugal with airline British 
Airways. Jason McGuinness, Ryanair's commercial director, commented: 'We are very pleased to announce a new 
route from Teesside to Faro on the back of the UK's green list announcement. 'Teesside customers will now have 
the choice of four popular destinations this summer, with flights to Alicante, Faro and Palma de Mallorca from June, 
and Corfu from July. 'Teesside Airport continues to deliver efficient operations and competitive airport charges, 
allowing for long-term traffic growth and new routes. 'To celebrate this new Faro route, we are launching a seat sale 
with fares available from just 19.99, for travel from June until the end of October 2021, which must be booked by 
midnight Thursday, 20 May.' Ben Houchen, mayor of Tees Valley, said: 'This is fantastic news, and yet another vote 
of confidence in our airport. Of course, it has only been made possible because of the tremendous take-up of 
Ryanair's flights to Alicante and Palma by local people. 'Passengers are showing they're backing our airport and 
Ryanair is paying back their commitment in spades. Even before the first flight has taken off, Ryanair has listened to 
what people have been crying out for and doubled its routes to give them a much-needed break. 'We've been 
working hard over the past few months to transform our terminal, get it fit for the 21st century and make it easier 
and smoother than ever to pass through. 'We can't wait to welcome people back through our doors for these great 
summer breaks - and our growing slate of other domestic and international flights.'   Looking to promote your

May 18, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] incurred a loss (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.68 per share in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2021 (ended Mar 31, 2021), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.65. Moreover, the 
amount of loss increased year over year. Results reflect coronavirus-induced disruptions to air-travel 
demand.However, quarterly revenues of $142.7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $122.4 million. 
The top line plunged 89.2% year over year. Fiscal 2021 Results Ryanair's net loss came in at €815 million in fiscal 
2021 against a profit of €1 billion in the year-ago period. Amid coronavirus-led travel-demand woes, the airline 
regarded fiscal 2021 as the most 'challenging' in its 35-year history. Total revenues declined 81% year over year to 
€1.64 billion. Traffic dropped 81% year over year to 27.5 million due to travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by 
several European governments. Load factor in the period was 71% compared with 95% in fiscal 2020. Ryanair

eps-surprise-chart?icid=chart-RYAAY-price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart Ryanair Holdings PLC price-consensus-
eps-surprise-chart[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] Ancillary revenues fell 80% year over year in fiscal 2021 due 
to significant decline in traffic. 
The airline's fuel costs declined 80% year over year due to reduced flying amid coronavirus-related fleet groundings 
as well as improved fuel burn. Total operating expenses declined 66% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks 
Rank #5 (Strong Sell), had cash of €3.15 billion at the end of Mar 31, 2021.You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[4]. Outlook Ryanair expects first-quarter fiscal 2022 traffic to be between 5 
million and 6 million guests. The airline anticipates its fiscal 2022 traffic to be in the low end of the previously-guided 
range of 80 million-120 million passengers. The carrier expects to benefit from pent-up demand for air travel in the 
second half of 2021 on hopes of successful vaccine roll outs and easing of European governments' travel 
restrictions. Consequently, it expects to break-even in fiscal 2022. On a further positive note, Ryanair hopes to 
return to pre-coronavirus levels of growth in summer 2022. Performance of Other Airline Stocks United Airlines 
UAL[5], carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), incurred a loss (excluding $3.21 from non-recurring items) of $7.5 per 
share in the first quarter of 2021, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $6.97. Operating revenues 
of $3,221 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,253.1 million.Southwest Airlines LUV[6], 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), incurred a loss of $1.72 per share (excluding $1.91 from non-recurring items) in 
the first quarter of 2021, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.82. Meanwhile, operating

May 18, 2021( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex)  Is that the smell of hope in the air? Or is it just the 
pungent scent of quinine from yet another gin &#38; tonic - my lockdown anxiety-busting drink of choice. Despite 
the handwringing of certain members of the self-appointed moral police it seems we did drink less in 2020. Yes off-
trade sales increased but the fact that pubs and restaurants have been closed for most of the last 12 months has 
meant that sales figures for gin and other spirits are significantly down. 
Irish gin sales grew in 2019 by 4.6% (compared to 1.5% for whiskey and a 0.6% for vodka) but those growth figures 
were easily wiped out by the COVID 19 lockdowns. The closure of the on-trade meant less opportunities for 
consumers to experiment with the new, and of course no boisterous launches or on-site promotions, so the 
lockdowns have been kinder to established brands than new entrants. Oisn Davis of Great Irish Beverages believes 
that the pandemic has 'Taken its toll on those who wish to launch new gins'. It's not all bad news however - Oisn 
has seen a surge in consumers becoming at-home mixologists, something which plays into the hands of startup 
and smaller brands and distilleries. 'The lockdown has seen millions of people around the world upskill their 
domestic mixology. This has been channelled by clever brand education in the online realm - brands that did not 
focus on online in the last year are floundering at best or at worse, failing,' he said. Of the boom in hard seltzers and 
canned, RTD (ready to drink) cocktails, Oisn sees them as a mixed bag. 'Ready to drink mixes have definitely seen 
an increase, partly driven by the sudden growth of the hard seltzer category and the simplicity of the single serve 
G&#38;T in a can, perfect for al fresco socialising. However the quality of the canned gin &#38; tonics needs to be 
improved as some are just criminally awful and far too low in ABV,' he said. The pandemic has had one tiny positive 
for the gin world and that is the creation of a brand new gin called Runway28[1], named for Dublin Airport's main 
runway. Runway28 has an aviation theme with a picture of an old Dakota Passenger Plane on the label and is the 
creation of MarieAnn McLoughlin-Dwyer, a former air steward, and her partner who is a captain with 
Ryanair.MarieAnn has more recently worked in food product development for the aviation industry and supplying 
airline crew through Kilbarron Aviation, her Donegal based company. 'There are more than 50 Irish gins on the 
market but we think we have something different,' said MarieAnn. 'We wanted to put our pandemic downtime to 
good use and while we stuck to classic botanicals we have added a healthy kick of pepper to our gin which we 
created with Listoke Distillery in Louth.' Runway28 is gaining traction and is available in independent off-licences 
but MarieAnn hopes to focus more on travel retail, especially the 50ml miniature market for inflight service and 
possibly cruise ships. Another new entry is Stillgarden Distillery[2] who have really hit the ground running and 
Flying High Over Ireland 's Gin Scene
recently won best new distillery at the 2021 Irish Enterprise Awards. For Christmas 2020 they created a rather tasty 
Christmas gin with notes of plum pudding, and their latest gin product is a mid-strength Give and Take gin which at 
22% is aimed at the trend towards lower alcohol drinks. Stillgarden are based in Inchicore and was created by 
Vickie Baird and her partner Pat O'Brien. They have been hugely creative in the last 18 months. Many of their 
botanicals are grown by a team of volunteer 'Social Botanists' in their community garden in Inchicore. Locals are 
encouraged to return their empties to be refilled and receive discounts and as well as gin they have a new Aperol 
style drink on the way, and cocktail pouches in recyclable tetra packs. Established brands have not sat still over the 
past year either. Blackwater now have a mail-order club with a new gin every two months plus a fun spirit - their 
limoncello was one of the best things I tasted in 2020. In April 2021 Gunpowder released a Sardinian Citrus version 
of their hugely successful gin (which sells more than any other sku in Dublin Airport). This new iteration is made 
with Citrus Monstruosa and has a distinct lemon-grapefruit tang. Another new gin you might have missed is 3 Sq. 
Miles Gin from the new distillery on Cape Clear Island - about time Ireland got in on the island distillery act. It's 
wonderful, infused with the usual botanicals but also fuschia flowers from the island which give it a distinct floral 
note, mixing nicely with the salt 'n pepper ozone notes. Expect more seasonal gins and boutique gins - soon every 
five star hotel in the country will have their own and probably most four star hotels too. As home cocktail making 
became the norm in 2020 expect more kits and pouches like the ones from Stillgarden. Expect canned G&#38;T to 
attempt a return (the jury is out on this) and expect more creativity mixed with the local. My final advice to anyone 
looking to create a new gin is to go to their local park and start sniffing things - it's doubtful, but there might be 
something there that hasn't yet been used as a botanical. [ 1]: https://www.runway28gin.com/ [ 2]:

May 12, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on May 17.Due to the coronavirus-induced 
declining passenger revenues, this European low-cost carrier suffered a loss in each of the last four quarters. 
However, the loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each quarter. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price 
and EPS Surprise https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price-eps-surprise?icid=chart-RYAAY-price-eps-
surprise Ryanair Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3]Moreover, the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's loss has narrowed to $1.65 from $2.20, 60 days ago.Against 
this backdrop, let's examine the factors that are likely to have impacted the company's performance in the fiscal 
fourth quarter.Akin to the last few quarters, we expect Ryanair's performance in the to-be-reported quarter to have 
been affected by low passenger revenues on a year-over-year basis. 
The resurgence of coronavirus cases in some parts of Europe worsened the already weak travel-demand scenario, 
which is likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported results.Slow vaccine rollout in the European Union is also likely 
to have hurt traffic, which in turn, might have dented passenger revenues. Additionally, as a result of dismal traffic, 
load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) is likely to have declined year over year in the to-be-reported 
quarter.However, Ryanair's efforts to cut costs in the face of dwindling passenger revenues are expected to have 
aided its bottom-line performance in the fiscal fourth-quarter. What Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model 
does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ryanair this time around. The combination of a positiveEarnings 
ESP[4]and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of a positive surprise, which is not 
the case here as shown below. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[5]Earnings

2021 (ended Dec 31, 2020), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.95. Meanwhile, in the 
year-ago period, the company reported earnings of 43 cents per share. Results reflect coronavirus-induced

Apr 30, 2021( The Antiplanner: http://ti.org/antiplanner Delivered by Newstex)  Rail advocates like to claim that the 
introduction of high-speed trains has led to a cessation of airline service, apparently to show that high-speed trains 
can compete against faster planes. While this may have happened on a few routes, European air travel before the 
pandemic was growing far faster than rail travel. For example, in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain — the main 
European countries with high-speed rail — rail travel[1] between 2011 and 2019 grew by 14 percent while air 
travel[2] grew by 34 percent. 
No European country saw rail travel grow faster than air travel. The government of France has found a solution to 
for-profit airlines outcompeting government-subsidized trains: ban the competing air travel. Under a law passed 
earlier this month[3], airlines will not be allowed to operate on routes that trains can serve in less than two-and-a-
half hours. If high-speed trains were able to compete on their own, they wouldn't need such a law. Of course, 
French politicians justified this law based on the supposed savings in carbon emissions. But conventional trains are 
only a little more energy efficient than planes, and high-speed trains require well over 50 percent more energy, per 
train-car-mile, than conventional trains. Passenger occupancies also tend to be much higher on planes than trains 
— typically 85 percent vs. 50 percent — because planes usually operate in non-stop service while trains make 
many stops, so the size of planes can be set to demand while trains must be sized to fit the portion of the journey 
where demand is highest.  France gets most of its electricity from nuclear power, so electric-powered transportation 
won't emit much greenhouse gases. However, constructing high-speed rail lines can produce tens of thousands of 
tons of greenhouse gases per mile, while planes require very little infrastructure. The net result is that it isn't clear 
whether high-speed trains are cleaner than flying. Ironically, the same bill that limited short-haul flights gave Air 
France-KLM (which is 18 percent owned by the government) €4 billion to help it cope with the pandemic. Air France 
mainly though not exclusively does long-haul flights, and even before the pandemic it had decided to reduce[4] its 
short-haul flights. Meanwhile, the airlines that do short-haul flights that will be most affected by France's pro-train 
law are low-cost carriers such as Ryanair[5] and easyJet[6]. These airlines — most of which are not French-owned 
— also compete against Air France on some long-haul routes. So the new law simultaneously reduces competition 
for France's government-owned high-speed trains as well as hurts competition to the partly government-owned flag 
carrier. Somehow I don't think this is really about greenhouse gases.https://www.addtoany.com/share [ 1]:

https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/airlines-across-the-globe-count-the-7bn-cost-of-covid/A slower than anticipated 
global vaccine rollout and wider failure to get Covid under control will cost airlines $10bn (7.2bn) more than 
previously predicted, according to the organisation that represents global airlines.The warning from the International 
Air Transport Association came as Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned on Wednesday there would be 
'seismic' cut in capacity across the industry due to the pandemic, including up to 25% fewer flights in Europe. 
O'Leary said travel from the UK to the EU would become more expensive and cumbersome as a result of Brexit, 
while leisure travel would not return to normal until 2023. Willie Walsh, the former boss of British Airways' parent 
company IAG and new director general of Iata, railed against the cost of the PCR Covid tests now required for air 
travel, and criticised the government's decision to charge VAT on the products. 
The standard VAT rate of 20% applies to private testing kits. Walsh said: 'I am surprised that consumer groups 
have not been focused on this issue. If we are doing these tests because there is a health crisis, governments 
shouldn't be charging VAT and people should not be profiteering off the back of it. ' The aviation industry is now 
expected to lose around $48bn during 2021, according to new Iata forecasts, more than a quarter higher than the 
$38bn it predicted last December. Iata pointed to the slower vaccine rollout in countries including France and 
Germany, as well as in emerging markets for the higher losses, combined with the rise of new virus variants and 
continued restrictions on international travel restrictions. North American airlines have fared better than those in 
Europe thanks to a domestic recovery. They are forecast to lose $5bn this year rather than $11bn as estimated in 
December. However, European carriers are set to lose $22bn, up from December's estimate of $12bn, and 
following a $35bn loss last year. Iata is also expecting much higher fuel prices, with jet fuel seen at $68.9 a barrel 
and oil at $64.2 a barrel - up from the $49.5 and $45.5 a barrel forecast in December - as the strengthening global 
economy pushes energy prices higher. Cost-cutting by airlines and a return to flying on some domestic routes has 
helped the industry to reduce its forecast losses from the $126bn lost in 2020, although carriers are still not 
predicted to break even until 2022. Airlines have increased their numbers of cargo flights during the pandemic, a 
trend which is expected to continue, however Iata warned this would not cover the collapse in passenger travel, 
meaning airline operating revenues are expected to reach only 55% of 2019 levels during 2021. 'This crisis is 
longer and deeper than anyone could have expected,' Walsh said. 'Losses will be reduced from 2020, but the pain 
of the crisis increases. There is optimism in domestic markets where aviation's hallmark resilience is demonstrated 
Airlines across the globe count the 7bn cost of Covid
by rebounds in markets without internal travel restrictions. Government-imposed travel restrictions, however, 
continue to dampen the strong underlying demand for international travel.' Iata said demand for tickets on domestic 
flights in China and North America showed passengers were keen to return to the skies. Demand for travel within 
China has already surpassed 2019 levels. Despite the continuing travel restrictions, Iata estimates that 2.4 billion 
people will travel by air in 2021. The group said: 'We have not written off 2021, as the vaccination forecasts 
suggests some advanced economy markets should be able to open and we anticipate a strong fourth quarter as a 
result.' Iata expects travel between the UK and the US, which both aim to have fully vaccinated 75% of their adult 
populations by July, to resume earlier than travel to and from continental Europe. Walsh criticised the UK 
government's requirement for PCR testing for travellers before departure and after arrival, calling the fees being 
charged for tests 'clearly outrageous'. He added: 'We've got to challenge the need for PCR[tests], is it the only 
acceptable risk mitigant that can be put in place when there's a significant improvement in the quality and speed 
and price of other tests.' The Treasury is understood to be considering how it can reduce the cost of travel, while 
ensuring it is as safe as possible. This could include cheaper tests being used when holidaymakers return home, 
and the possibility of the government providing pre-departure tests. Read more: Airlines across the globe count the

Apr 19, 2021( ValueWalk Premium: https://valuewalkpremium.com Delivered by Newstex)  Brook Asset 
Management was up 7.27% for the first quarter, compared to the MSCI GBT TR Net World Index, which returned 
3.96%. For March, the fund was up 1.1%. Q1 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[1] 
https://valuewalkpremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/invest_1598897412.png In his March letter to investors, 
which was reviewed by ValueWalk, James Hanbury of Brook said returns during the first quarter were driven by 
their long equity book, which contributed 12% but were partially offset by the losses in the short book, which 
detracted 3.84%. Currency hedges added 0.67%. The long book generated alpha of 4.97%, while the short book 
generated 0.67% alpha. The markets were positive on the back of stronger macro data, positive news about COVID 
vaccines and additional fiscal stimulus.Top contributors during Q1The biggest contributor from Brook's long book 
was TCS Group Holding PLC (MCX:TCSG), which added 1.97%. The Russian fintech company's stock rose as 
founder Oleg Tinkoff gave up his super voting rights and handled governance concerns. Investors also started 
including multiples on the company's non-credit businesses, which now account for 37% of its revenues. U.S. 
satellite company ViaSat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) added 1.76% as value stocks came back into favor. Brook's U.K. 
leisure stocks also did well during the first quarter as the country rolled out the vaccine and saw improvements in 
deaths and hospital admissions compared to mainland Europe. National Express Group PLC (OTCMKTS:NXPGF) 
(LON:NEX) contributed 1.31%, while JD Wetherspoon plc (LON:JDW) added 0.7%, and Restaurant Group 
contributed 0.61%. Hanbury said their U.K. leisure stocks balanced with their airline positions, which are more 
focused on international travel. Brook's airline stocks were mixed during the quarter. IAG (LON:AIG) contributed 
0.91%, while EasyJet (OTCMKTS:ESYJY) {LON:EZJ) added 0.37%, and Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ:RYAAY) 
(LON:RYA) subtracted 0.02%, while Jet2 (LON:JET2) took off 0.59%.Other contributorsHanbury said their U.K. 
construction stocks also did well during the first quarter following strong U.K. macro developments, continued 
government focus and strong financial results. Vistry Group PLC (LON:VTY) contributed 0.47%, Forterra Inc 
(NASDAQ:FRTA) (LON:FORT) added 0.41%, and Travis Perkins (OTCMKTS:TPRKY) returned 0.36%. Ibstock 
(LON:IBST) contributed 0.27%, while SIG plc (LON:SHI) added 0.21%, and Breedon contributed 0.14%. IP Group 
Plc (LON:IPO) added 0.98% due to the return to net asset value growth as seen in the 2020 earnings results. 
Additionally, the firm's largest position, which makes up one-quarter of its net asset value, has started preparing for 
an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Brook's commodity and cyclical stocks also did well during 
Brook Asset Management had a strong first quarter, is shorting This US education stock [Exclusive]
the first quarter due to strong macro and stimulus data and positive supply side dynamics. ArcelorMittal SA 
(NYSE:MT) contributed 1.05%, while Glencore (OTCMKTS:GLNCY) (LON:GLEN) added 0.88%, SLC Agricola 
(OTCMKTS:SLCJY) returned 0.6%, and Maersk Drilling (OTCMKTS:DDRLG) contributed 0.63%. Rusal 
(MCX:RUAL) returned 0.39%, while Total contributed 0.27%.Biggest detractorsThe fund's biggest detractor during 
the first quarter was AO World (LON:AO), which lost 2.73%. The company reported stronger-than-expected sales 
but weaker profits, and Hanbury expects its March quarter to be similar. However, he also believes AO can report 
"decent" double-digit growth for its March 2022 year. Brook's short book lost money but generated positive alpha. 
Two if its biggest detractors were its private equity investment management shorts. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) 
detracted 1.37%, while Partners Group (OTCMKTS:PGPHF) subtracted 0.67%. Hanbury believes the environment 
will be "unhelpful" to their businesses compared to how it has been over the last decade, but their valuations 
suggest the good times will continue for many years. Eurofins (OTCMKTS:ERRFY) subtracted 0.64% during the 
first quarter. Although Hanbury still feels its valuation is too high and the quality of its accounting is very low, he said 
they made a mistake in underestimating the COVID PCR tests the company has benefited from.Other 
detractorsBrookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY) subtracted 0.47% after its largest shareholder, Brookfield 
Asset Management, bid for it at a 16% premium. CD Projeckt (OTCMKTS:OTGLY) was a good short position during 
the quarter, adding 0.44% on a small position. Hanbury said they established the short position when they believed 
it was priced for perfection in the second half of 2020. The stock plunged when the company's flagship game, 
Cyberpunk 2077, arrived with multiple bugs and was pulled from the PlayStation store. IG Group 
(OTCMKTS:IGGHY) added 0.45% after acquiring Tastytrade for $1 billion. Most of the deal was paid in IG shares 
with twice the multiple that IG trades on itself. Hanbury believes IG is paying a high multiple for a cyclically high 
earnings number in what he calls the kind of deal that's "the antithesis of what we look for in our owner-managed 
businesses where shareholders' cash and shares are generally treated with more respect."Biggest short 
contributorsBrook's biggest contributing short during the quarter was Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ:PTON), 
which took a hit as its important U.S. market improved with the reopening of economies in many states. Peloton 
trades at a value of $16,000 per subscriber, and Hanbury believes the market underestimates the competition and 
demand pull forward that has happened for Peloton's products. The fund's second-biggest contributing short 
position was Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG), a new position Hanbury highlighted in the letter. The company has a $12 
billion market cap and operates in the higher education industry. When it was founded in 2000, it was a digital 
message board where students traded advice on applications, internships and scholarships. After a change in CEO 
and strategic shift in 2007, Chegg focused on renting college textbooks to students. By 2020, it generated about 
20% of its roughly $600 million in revenue from textbook rentals, with the other 80% coming from digital homework 
help products. Hanbury's short thesis is based on concerns about what will happen when students return to campus 
and to their traditional academic support networks. He's also concerned about falling university enrollment and the 
trend toward digital textbooks and courseware. Hanbury also questions whether Chegg's digital homework help 
products actually help students. Multiple news reports last year indicated that college students were using Chegg's 
products to cheat on online exams. Specifically he states: Ultimately, we wonder whether university or even 
government-level action to curtail usage of Chegg may materialise. Finally, we think direct competition is also rising 
as existing competitors like Bartleby and Coursehero fill-out their product range and as textbook publisher Pearson 
launches its own college study app later this year.At its current $88 share price, Chegg trades on EV/sales multiples 
of around 18x and 15x for FY 2020 and 2021 respectively. We feel these multiples are very high given a historical 
lack of underlying profitability and the risks outlined above and we note recent share sales by both the company 
and its CEO.   Top positionsBrook's top 10 long positions as a percentage of net asset value were Plus500 Ltd 
(LON:PLUS), AO World PLC (LON:AO), IWG PLC (LON:IWG), Jet2, ArcelorMittal, Serco Group plc 
(OTCMKTS:SECCF) (LON:SRP), IP Group, Glencore, Conduit Holdings Limited (LON:CRE)and Frasers Group 
PLC (LON:FRAS). During the quarter, Brook rotated some of its airline holdings into oil majors, including trimming 
all names and selling out of Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) and IAG completely. The fund has been adding to 
BP plc (NYSE:BP) (LON:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) and Total SE (NYSE:TOT), which have been 
focusing on their environmental responsibilities. Brook is still overweight the U.K. In the construction space, 
Hanbury finds consensus forecasts to be too pessimistic. Vistry is the only homebuilder the fund owns, and he 
believes it is poorly understood by the market, mostly due to its unusual partnership division. The fund sold its 
Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), AGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO) and Nov Inc (NYSE:NOV) positions during 
the quarter. Brook continues to invest in Plus500, which has returned 1,500% since their investment at the initial 
public offering. Hanbury had expected shares to re-rate higher, but that never materialized. However, he still

RYAAY[1] anticipates its fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31, 2022) traffic to be hit by adversities arising from the European 
Union's slow vaccine rollout.Per a statement[2], the company estimates its fiscal 2022 traffic to be at the low end of 
the guided range of 80 million-120 million passengers, as a result of 'Easter travel restrictions/lockdowns and a 
delayed traffic recovery into the peak summer 21 season, due to the slow rollout in the EU of COVID-19 vaccines'. 
Additionally, the Irish low-cost airline stated that it expects to nearly break even in fiscal 2022.However, on a 
positive note, Ryanair narrowed its guidance for net loss in fiscal 2021 (ended Mar 31, 2021) to €800 million-€850 
million from €850 million-€950 million expected previously. Meanwhile, Ryanair Group's fiscal 2021 traffic declined 
to 27.5 million passengers from 149 million in fiscal 2020 due to coronavirus-induced flight cancellations and travel 
restrictions. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/price?icid=chart-

Apr 08, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Avelo Airlines just 
broke cover and plans to start flights on April 28 from Burbank, California. Andrew Levy, former president of 
Allegiant Air, is at the helm with a focus on cheap flights and friendly service. A total of 11 routes have already been 
announced to popular destinations across the American West. See more stories on Insider's business page[1].It's 
lights, cameras, action for America's newest airline that's planning its Hollywood debut later this month. 
Avelo Airlines plans to launch flights on April 28 from Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, giving travelers 
yet another option when planning pandemic getaways. The new ultra-low-cost airline is focused on cheap leisure 
flights and will fly to popular destinations in the American West from before expanding across the country. "Avelo is 
a different and better kind of airline, built from scratch to offer an affordable, convenient and caring travel 
experience," chief executive Andrew Levy said in a press release. The initial slate of 11 routes from Burbank 
include flights to: Santa Rosa, California from April 28;Pasco, Washington from April 29;Bozeman, Montana from 
April 30;Phoenix, Arizona from May 3;Ogden, Utah from May 4;Grand Junction,Colorado from May 9; 
Medford,Oregon from May 9;Eugene, Oregon from May 12;Bend, Oregon from May 13;Eureka, California from May 
19; andRedding, California from May 20. Burbank, just north of downtown Los Angeles, offers a convenient 
alternative to Los Angeles International Airport that the company hopes will help spur bookings and encourage 
flyers to travel. "A big part of our business model is not just offering every day, great fares," Levy told Insider. 
"We're a low-cost carrier. We're built to offer low fares, but at the same time we're going to offer a great level of 
convenience by utilizing Burbank, which we think is probably the best secondary airport in the country."An airport 
stuck in time, the one-story terminal building at Burbank resembles a scene from the 1950s. Passengers are 
required to board aircraft directly from the tarmac since there are no jetways. . The Boeing 737-800, a tried and true 
narrow-body aircraft that can seat 189 people in the airline's all-economy configuration, will be Avelo's flagship 
aircraft. The plane is a staple of other well-known low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, 
and Ryanair thanks to its low operating costs and high availability on the market. In true ultra-low-cost fashion, 
flyers won't find seat-back entertainment screens - though WiFi may be coming within the next year. Avelo says it's 
working with potential suppliers for the service. In-flight snacks and drinks service won't be offered in the airline's 
initial run, either, due to the pandemic. Customers will instead receive a "convenience package" with hand sanitizer,

a bottle of water, and a small snack. The bulk of the aircraft's seating are "slimline" seats, the term for thinner seats 
on airplanes, with only 29 inches of pitch across the 129 seats. The remaining 60 seats, however, will range in pitch 
from 31 to 38 inches, and reserving one will cost at least $18. Fares as low as $19 are being offered on all of the 
airline's initial routes from April into mid-June for some destinations, except for flights around Memorial Day 
Weekend. They're just introductory fares but low ticket prices are part of Avelo's overall strategy to stimulate 
demand in underserved markets and become a go-to for cheap flights."Quite honestly, I'd love to be able to do, 
over many years, what Southwest has done," Levy said. "Where when people hear 'Avelo,' they just associate us 
with low fares."Offering low fares, however, means that Avelo will have to fill its planes as close to the brim as 
possible in order to turn a profit. "We're looking to sell the flights very full, we're defining full as 80-85%," Levy 
said.And unlike competitors, Avelo doesn't have a robust system of extra fees to fall back on. Advanced seat 
assignments start at $5 and checking a bag will only cost $10, with the latter meant to open more space in the cabin 
during boarding and deplaning. There's also no fee to make a flight change or make a reservation over the phone. 
These extra charges, known as ancillary fees, have become the backbone of ultra-low-cost airlines' strategy as they 
don't incur taxes. Keeping calm during a crippling pandemic for airlines Avelo, one of two low-cost airlines launching 
operations during the pandemic[2], has the benefit of an experienced founder. Levy formerly served as the co-
founder and president of Allegiant Air and chief financial officer of United Airlines. "I think probably during the 
pandemic, maybe the hardest thing was just to keep everybody calm and to recognize that there's a lot of good 
that's going to come from the end of the business cycle," Levy said.The industry veteran was actually optimistic 
instead of pessimistic when the pandemic hit the US in March 2020. Leveling the playing field for airlines made it 
easier for a new entrant to compete with established players. Congress ultimately saved many airlines from 
possible bankruptcy, but the pandemic's outcome still favors leisure airlines like Avelo, analysts say. More 
Americans are willing to get back in the air after an extended pandemic[3] and ultra-low-cost airlines are allowing 
them to do it without breaking the bank. Read More: Spirit Airlines' low-cost model puts it in the perfect spot to be 
the big winner of the pandemic, a Deutsche Bank analyst says[4]"I think all of our investors realize that this will 
have been a pretty strong opportunity for us to get into markets we otherwise wouldn't have been able to get into, 
take advantage of materially lower costs for things like airplanes, office leases, IT contracts, parts agreements, 
etc.," Levy said. Avelo currently has three planes and more than 200 crew members but plans to have six Boeing 
737s and 400 crew members by the end of the year. Read the original article on Business Insider[5] [ 1]:

Apr 07, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
management at the Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Areas Inteligentes GOL[1] stated that the airline operated 
only 245 domestic flights per day (on average) in March compared with 355 and 489 flights a day, on average, in 
the respective months of February and January. This sharp decline was due to Brazil being hit by the second wave 
of coronavirus cases. Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[2] March traffic report was also dismal due to a fresh spike in 
COVID-19 gripping many countries in Europe.However, in the United States, air-travel demand is northbound as 
more and more Americans get vaccinated with each passing day. Anticipating this demand to surge further in the 
upcoming summer season, Southwest Airlines LUV[3] recalled some of its pilots from the coronavirus-induced 
voluntary leave. 
Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE[4] announced an expansion update in response to the air-travel demand uptick in 
the United States.Notably,United Airlines UAL[5] also recently announced its plan to bolster its domestic network in 
a bid to meet the expected recovery in air-travel demand during summer. This was mentioned in detail in 
theprevious week's writeup[6]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. At Gol Linhas, traffic, measured 
in revenue passenger kilometers, plunged 47.7% year over year in March. In the same month, capacity measured 
in available seat kilometers contracted 47.8%. Since traffic decline was marginally less than capacity contraction, 
load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) inched up 0.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 71.8%. 
Gol Linhas' total monthly departures slumped 52% while seats tanked 50.7%. Due to the recent spike in COVID-19 
cases, demand in the domestic market declined 32% during March from the February levels. Moreover, supply 
contracted 23% in the same month on a month-over-month basis due to the reduction in demand for tickets coupled 
with increased cancellations and no-shows[7].2. Ryanair's March traffic tanked 91% year over year to merely 0.5 
million guests. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair dived 81% to 27.5 million. The carrier's load factor in 
the month was 77% compared with 91% a year ago[8].3. Per aReuters report[9],Southwest Airlines, currently 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), recalled 209 pilots from a voluntary extended leave program as it prepares to 
meet the anticipated increase in travel demand during the summer season. Per the report, the pilots' status will 
become active Jun 1 onward. Prior to their resumption of duty, they will complete the necessary requalification 
training requirements. Other airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines DAL[10] also called back pilots, rendered 
inactive by the pandemic as the report suggests.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV 's Pilot Recall News, GOL 's Dull Traffic Report & More
Buy) stocks here[11].4. Spirit Airlines will start operating daily flights connecting Los Angeles International Airport 
(LAX) with Mexico's Los Cabos International Airport on May 5. Notably, this marks the low-cost carrier's first 
international service out of LAX. Additionally, the carrier will initiate nonstop flights to Puerto Vallarta's Licenciado 
Gustavo Diaz Ordaz International Airport from LAX, starting Jul 1[12].5. Alaska Air Group's ALK[13] subsidiary 
Alaska Airlines joined the oneworld alliance as its 14th full member. The airline had received a formal invitation to 
join the global alliance in July 2020. As part of oneworld, Alaska Airlines will be able to strengthen its global network 
to cover as many as 1,000 destinations across more than 170 countries and territories. With this membership, the 
carrier will add seven airline partners and enhance its existing partnerships with six oneworld members[14]. Price 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the past six monthsThe table above shows that all airline stocks, barring Gol Linhas, which is suffering 
disappointing air-travel demand following the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, have traded in the 
green over the past week. Evidently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 2.4% over the past week to 
$110.40. Over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker has surged 93.2%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? Investors will look forward to the March traffic reports of Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[15] and Azul 
AZUL[16] The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's 
predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first 
trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See

EU greenlights €4 billion aid plan for Air France
EU greenlights €4 billion aid plan for Air France

Apr 06, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
European Union has approved a plan to prop up Air France amid a pandemic-induced collapse in passenger 
numbers. In return, the airline must give up some flight slots to competitors.The European Commission on Tuesday 
gave the go-ahead for the French government to inject up to €4 billion ($4.7 billion) into its national carrier Air 
France.Although the airline is struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rescue package did come 
with conditions.What terms did the EU impose?
In a statement, the commission — which acts to ensure that state aid does not give companies an unfair advantage 
— said Paris is allowed to contribute €4 billion to help keep Air France afloat.However, to access the help, the 
airline would have to relinquish about 18 takeoff and landing slots per day at Orly, Paris' second-largest hub after 
Charles de Gaulle."The public support will come with strings attached, in particular, to ensure the French state is 
sufficiently remunerated, and further measures to limit distortions of competition," said EU Competition 
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."This gives competing carriers the chance to expand their activities at this 
airport, ensuring fair prices and increased choice for European consumers."French Finance Minister Bruno Le 
Maire said the French state would also be allowed to raise its stake in the national carrier from the current 14.3% to 
30%."This is good news for Air France and good news for the French," Le Maire told the France Inter radio 
station.Dutch stake to be dilutedThe French recapitalization means the Dutch government must accept a reduction 
of its 14% share of the Air France-KLM holding company — a surprise acquisition it made in 2019.Dutch Finance 
Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the government of the Netherlands has agreed to allow its stake to be diluted to 
9.3%.In a previous round of support around COVID-19 last year, France gave Air France-KLM €7 billion. 
Meanwhile, the Netherlands provided €3.4 billion in loans and loan guarantees.The airline KLM is not expected to 
benefit from the latest round of French aid.Previous challenges by RyanairBudget Irish carrier Ryanair has 
challenged previous French aid for Air France, saying it distorts competition.In the past, the commission has often 
said it sympathizes with Ryanair's criticism of state subsidies for legacy national airlines.In February, Ryanair lost a 
legal fight in the EU General Court against state aid being granted to Air France and Sweden's SAS through 
national schemes.In EU courts, Ryanair is seeking to contest the German government's bailout of Lufthansa, as 
well as similar schemes in Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal.

Apr 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the resurgence of 
coronavirus cases gripping several parts of Europe including the UK, Ireland and some other countries in the EU, it 
was pretty predictable that the Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] March traffic report will be poor. 
The fresh wave of the pandemic only worsened the already tepid air-travel demand as a result of the reimposed 
travel-related restrictions.The European carrier's March traffic declined 91% year over year to merely 0.5 million 
guests. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair dived 81% to 27.5 million. 
The carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the month was 77% compared with 91% a 
year ago.Due to the renewed spike in coronavirus cases induced by the new strains, shares of Ryanair have 
underperformed its industry[2]'s growth over the past month. While the stock has gained 2.3%, the industry has 
appreciated 3.4%.The traffic data apart, Ryanair was in news recently when the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) reportedly[3] approved the design for the Boeing 737-8200 jets, which are basically a higher-passenger 
capacity version of the 737-8 MAX.The clearance of the design was necessary before The Boeing Company BA[4] 
can start delivering these higher-capacity jets to Ryanair. In December 2020, the carrier announced the placement 
of a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX 8200 planes. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broaderTransportation[5]sector areUSA Truck, Inc. USAK[6]

Mar 25, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] announced an expanded U.K. summer 2021 schedule despite concerns over rising coronavirus cases in 
many European countries. The airline attributed this decision to the successful vaccine rollout program in the U.K., 
based on which it expects government to allow travel during the summers.Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, stated, 
'The U.K. government has implemented a very successful vaccine rollout program, and is on track for a re-opening 
of EU short-haul travel this summer.' O'Leary told Sky News[2] that he anticipates countries across Europe, 
including the UK, to stop "locking people down" from June despite media "hysteria" over whether travel will be 
allowed during the summer holidays.As part of the expanded schedule, Ryanair will operate more than 2,300 
weekly flights across 480 routes. The airline will add 26 new routes to popular holiday destinations in France, 
Greece, 
Italy, 
Portugal 
and 
Spain.

https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-fundamental/priceRyanair 
Holdings PLC price[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4]The announcement comes close on the heels of a new 
coronavirus law which states that anyone who leaves England to travel out of the country without a reasonable 
reason (such as work, medical or compassionate grounds, and attending weddings and funerals) will be fined 5,000 
pounds. 
The new law, set to go into effect next week, could last until the end of June.Under the government's lockdown-
easing roadmap, foreign travel was expected to potentially resume from May 17 onward. However, prime minister 
Boris Johnson's recent warning that the U.K. could soon be hit with a third wave of coronavirus, makes the timing of 
the resumption of international travel blurry.Meanwhile, Johnson said that international leisure travel restrictions will 
only be eased after a review in April. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some

Mar 24, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  U.S. stock markets 
closed lower on Tuesday as concerns mounted over global economic reopening as fresh COVID-19 restrictions are 
being imposed across major European countries. Moreover, investors also became concerned about the cost of the 
government's infrastructure spending and potential tax hikes. All the three major stock indexes ended the day in 
red. 
How Did The Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.9%, or 308.05 points, closing at 
32,423.15, snapping its gains from Monday. Notably, 22 components of the 30-stock index ended in red while 8 
finished the day in green.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed the day at 13,227.70, down 1.1% or 149.84 
points, reversing its two-day winning streak, on the back of weak performance by large-cap technology stocks. The 
S&#38;P 500 lost 0.8%, closing the day at 3,910.52, giving up its gains from Monday. The Materials Select Sector 
SPDR (XLB) and the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) dipped 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Notably, eight out 
of eleven sectors of the benchmark index closed in the negative zone and three in green.The fear-gauge CBOE 
Volatility Index (VIX) was up 7.5% to 20.30. A total of 12.10 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the 
last 20-session average of 14.04 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.42-to-1 ratio. On 
Nasdaq, a 6.64-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. Concerns Over Fresh COVID-19 Restrictions Globally Moved 
Wall Street Lower Wall Street moved lower on Tuesday as concerns mounted over global economic reopening as 
fresh COVID-19 restrictions are being imposed globally. Notably, major European countries like Germany extended 
its lockdown till Apr 18 while on Saturday, almost a third of France entered into a one-month 
lockdown.Consequently, shares of airline stocks which depend on economic reopening like Mesa Air Group, Inc. 
MESA[1] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2] fell 4.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, both companies carry a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
Investors Became Concerned Over Cost of Infrastructure Spending and Potential Tax Hikes Investors' sentiment 
also took a hit on Tuesday as concerns rose over the cost of infrastructure spending as well as potential tax hikes in 
order to pay for the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. Notably, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, at a hearing of the House 
Financial Services Committee, defended developing plans for raising taxes in the future for funding new public 
investments. Economic Data The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development jointly reported that the sales of new single-family houses in February 2021 decreased 18.2% to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 775,000, compared to the revised January rate of 948,000, missing the 
Stock Market News for Mar 24, 2021
consensus estimate of 867,000.The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the U.S. current account 
deficit for the fourth quarter of 2020 widened by $7.6 billion, or 4.2%, to $188.5 billion, compared to the revised third 
quarter estimate of $180.9 billion, and narrower than the consensus estimate of $188.8 billion. Time to Invest in 
Legal Marijuana If you're looking for big gains, there couldn't be a better time to get in on a young industry primed to 
skyrocket from $17.7 billion back in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027.After a clean sweep of 6 election 
referendums in 5 states, pot is now legal in 36 states plus D.C. Federal legalization is expected soon and that could 
be a still greater bonanza for investors. Even before the latest wave of legalization, Zacks Investment Research has

and aviation businesses including the British Airways owner, IAG, easyJet and the engine maker Rolls-Royce 
tumbled in early trading after the government warned the public not to book holidays abroad this summer.Investors 
took fright at the thought that the struggling airline and travel sectors could face another summer of lost bookings, 
as continental Europe struggles with the rollout of vaccine programmes. 
Shares in IAG, easyJet, Ryanair, the package holiday company Tui and the Jet2 airline fell as much as 7% in early 
trading on Monday. Rolls-Royce dipped by 3%. The negative outlook wiped off some of the strong gains made at 
travel-related businesses since the government announced its 'cautious but irreversible' roadmap out of lockdown 
on 22 February. While pandemic restrictions mean overseas holidays are banned, under Boris Johnson's roadmap 
the government had previously said they could resume as soon as 17 May. However, after warnings over the 
weekend from scientific experts that allowing summer holidays could risk another lockdown, ministers struck a more 
cautious tone in Monday morning broadcast interviews, prompting the airline and travel sector sell-off. 'My advice 
would be to anybody right now is just to hold off on booking international travel,' the social care minister, Helen 
Whately, told the BBC. 'It just feels premature to be booking international holidays at the moment.' Last week, the 
UK hit the milestone of half of all adults having received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, much 
of Europe is still struggling to get to grips with the pandemic, hampered by the slow rollout of vaccine programmes, 
rising infection rates and the impact of new variants. Mark Manduca, an airlines analyst at Citigroup, said he 
detected a 'heightened level of fatigue amongst fundamental investors' whose recovery hopes had propelled a 
recent rebound in airline stocks. 'The upside momentum-driven express train of all things recovery is now beginning 
to peter out and falter,' he said. Read more: Travel shares slide as Britons warned not to book foreign holidays[1] [

Boeing ( BA ) Gets Orders for 24 737 MAX Jets From 777 Partners
Boeing (BA) Gets Orders for 24 737 MAX Jets From 777 Partners

Mar 15, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing Company 
BA[1] recently received a purchase deal from private investment firm 777 Partners, wherein the company will add 
24 737-8s to the latter's aviation portfolio, with purchase rights for an additional 60 airplanes. At list prices, the 
transaction amount for 24 737-8 jets would be about $2.9 billion, although there remains a huge scope for 
discounts. Boeing's shares gained 6.8% to close at $269.19 on Mar 12, post the announcement of this deal. 
Significance of the Deal At a time when the entire aerospace industry is witnessing extreme downturns, and Boeing 
in particular witnessed around 460 order cancellations for the 737 MAX jets in 2020, this deal could be of massive 
significance for the company's ailing commercial business. 
More so, the new deal will likely boost Boeing's confidence in approaching other buyers for the 737 MAX jets. 
Moreover, as aircraft buyers anticipate a market recovery going ahead, this deal may encourage other aircraft 
leasing companies to place orders for the 737 MAX jets. What's Favoring Boeing Of Late? Ever since the grounding 
of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, the company made a series of upgrades to the plane and inducted several pilot 
training protocols, which finally enabled them to receive an approval from the Federal Aviation Administration in 
November 2020, certifying the 737 MAX safe for flying.The approval had an instant positive impact on the company 
as it clinched orders for 75 additional 737 MAX airplanes in December from Europe's largest airline — Ryanair. 
Also, during the same month, Alaska Airlines ALK[2] agreed to buy 23 737 MAX 9 jets. Recently, in March, per a 
CNBC report[3], the United Airlines UAL[4] announced that it is buying 25 additional 737 Max planes and taking 
delivery of other orders earlier than previously planned from Boeing as well.But the big news appeared earlier this 
month. Per major media sources, Boeing is reportedly close to clinching a multibillion-dollar deal from Southwest 
Airlines LUV[5] for a potential order of 130 737 MAX 7 aircraft, alongside significant options for 170 more 737 
aircraft.Interestingly, Boeing recently revealed that in February the aerospace giant registered more new orders for 
commercial planes than cancellations, for the first time in the past 15 months. It received 82 new orders while 
orders for 51 got cancelled.Over the past couple of months, Boeing has received firm orders for its commercial jets 
and also expects to grab major deals in the near future. This will provide a solid blow to Airbus SE, considering 
Boeing has been falling behind its arch rival for over past couple of years, following 737 jets' grounding in March 
2019. Price Performance &#38; Zacks Rank Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 107.7% in 
the past year compared with the industry[6]'s growth of 43.5%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1

Mar 11, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per major media 
sources, The Boeing Company BA[1] is reportedly close to clinching a multibillion-dollar deal from Southwest 
Airlines LUV[2] for its 737 MAX 7 aircraft. Per a report by Reuters[3], as Southwest Airlines plans on refreshing its 
fleet, it intends to potentially place 130 firm orders alongside significant options for 170 more 737 aircraft.At list 
prices, the transaction amount for 130 737 Max jets would be about $13 billion, although there remains huge scope 
for discounts. Boeing's shares gained 6.4% to close at $245.34 on Mar 10, post the announcement of this 
prospective mega deal. Significance of the Deal for Boeing At a time when the entire aerospace industry is 
witnessing a downturn, this prospective deal could be of massive significance to Boeing, which witnessed around 
460 order cancellations for the 737 MAX jets in 2020. The deal is likely to get accomplished as Southwest Airlines, 
in December 2020, revealed its intentions to resume commercial flight services[4] and fly its Boeing 737 MAX from 
March 2021. More so, the news of a possible deal will likely boost the company's confidence in approaching other 
buyers for the 737 MAX jets. 
What's Favoring Boeing Of Late? Ever since the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, the company made a 
series of upgrades to the plane and inducted several pilot training protocols, which finally enabled it to receive an 
approval from the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') in November 2020, certifying that the 737 MAX is safe for 
flying.The approval had an instant positive impact on the company as it cliched orders for 75 additional 737 MAX 
airplanes in December from Europe's largest airline company — Ryanair. Also, during the same month, Alaska 
Airlines ALK[5] agreed to buy 23 737 MAX 9 jets. Recently, in March, per a CNBC report[6], United Airlines UAL[7] 
announced that it is buying 25 additional 737 Max planes and taking delivery of other orders earlier than previously 
planned from Boeing as well.If the deal with Southwest Airlines materializes, it will surely benefit Boeing, which has 
been losing ground to its arch rival Airbus SE over the past couple of years, following 737's grounding in March 
2019. Price Performance &#38; Zacks Rank Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 58.5% in

Mar 08, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc's 
RYAAY[1] shares have declined 2.7% of value in the year-to-date period against the industry[2]'s 14.1% 
increase.Let's discuss the reasons for this drab price performance and discuss what lies ahead for the 
company.With renewed lockdowns in the U.K., Ireland and some other countries in the EU following the surge in 
coronavirus cases, Ryanair slashed its fiscal 2021 traffic forecast. The carrier expects fresh lockdowns and other 
travel-related restrictions to further affect travel demand. Notably, the carrier's February traffic was merely 0.5 
million, less than 1.3 million recorded in January 2021. The same is anticipated to be as low as 500,000 in March. 
With this, the airline estimates its fiscal 2021 traffic to be in the 26-30 million range compared with its earlier 
prediction of below 35 million.Due to the coronavirus-induced low demand, the company's fiscal 2020 profits were 
hurt by more than €40 million. The company incurred a loss of €731.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. 
Amid coronavirus-related uncertainties, Ryanair anticipates fiscal 2021 net loss (pre-exceptional items) to be 
between €850 million and €950 million.However, Ryanair's sound liquidity position is encouraging. At the end of the 
third quarter of fiscal 2021, the company's cash and cash equivalents stood at $4,163 million, way higher than the 
current debt of $2,214 million. This indicates that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt 
obligations. Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-
ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [3]sector are Kansas City Southern KSU[4], FedEx Corporation 
FDX[5] and Herc Holdings Inc. HRI[6]. Kansas City and FedEx carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Herc Holdings 
sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[7]Long-
term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Kansas City, FedEx and Herc Holdings is 
pegged at 15%, 12% and 31.2%, respectively. Zacks Names 'Single Best Pick to Double' From thousands of 
stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From 
those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.You know this 
company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround. Fresh from a 
successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' 
Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and Nvidia 
which boomed +175.9% in one year.Free: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up  > >[8]Want the latest

Mar 05, 2021( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex) ;; With the world grounded as a result of COVID 19, 
two aviation professionals decided to turn their hand at the world of gin making and created Runway28 Premium 
Irish Gin. Co-director MarieAnn Mc Loughlin Dwyer, with a background in both aviation and product development, 
and wife to one of Ireland's many grounded commercial airline pilots, researched, studied and blended in 
collaboration with the master distiller &#38; recipe experts at Listoke Distillery in Co. 
Louth, to craft and create Runway28 Premium Irish Gin. 'Runway28 Gin is a classic mix of earthy botanicals, with a 
hint of pepper. I wanted to celebrate and commemorate our small nation of pioneers, the spirited Irish, to highlight 
our unique nature and tradition, our ability to adapt, forge forward, and get creative, especially in the face of 
massive disruption,' said MarieAnn. 'The gin for me, is the perfect combination of all that I've learned over the 
years, much of which I owe to my time working within the Aviation industry. Teamwork, communication, goal setting 
and hard work, all remain constants for me from my early days of training as a member of cabin crew with Aer 
Lingus back in 1999, to my subsequent days working with Ryanair, and many other airlines traveling from base to 
base as a product developer and trade show host.' [embedded content] MarieAnn is joined by daughter Karen 
(sales training &#38; promotion) and step-daughter Siobhan (accounts/order fulfilment), in what has now become a 
family effort to push forward with this new gin brand in 2021. Runway28Gin is available online from mid February 
2021. For further information email hellorunway28@gmail.com [1].; [ 1]: hellorunway28@gmail.com

Mar 05, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines UAL[1] 
dominated headlines in the past week, thanks to its decision to buy 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX planes apart 
from moving forward the delivery of some other Boeing jets from the earlier scheduled date.On the traffic front, the 
demand for Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes'GOL[2] flights in domestic markets plunged 38% in February 2021 over 
the January levels due to the recent spike in coronavirus cases in Brazil. Meanwhile, European carrier Ryanair 
Holdings' RYAAY[3] traffic tanked more than 90% year over year in February as the pandemic continues to dwarf 
air-travel demand.Read the last Airline Roundup here[4]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. 
United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has placed an order for 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX 
planes and pre-scheduled the delivery of some other orders in hopes of acceleration in travel-demand recovery. 
While the 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2023, the carrier has moved up 
deliveries of 40 previously-ordered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to 2022 and five of the same variant into 2023.In total, 
the carrier has firm commitments for 188 Boeing 737 MAX jets[5].You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6].In another development, United Airlines announced that it is partnering with 
premium ground transportation company, Landline, to offer connecting services to two popular destinations in 
Colorado through the Denver International Airport. 
Under the partnership, customers will enjoy seamless travel experience to Breckenridge and Fort Collins on a 
luxury bus from Denver, CO[7].2. Ryanair's February traffic slumped 95% year over year to merely 0.5 million 
guests as coronavirus keeps air-travel demand suppressed. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) for the 
month was 78% compared with the prior year's 92%. On a rolling-annual basis, total traffic at Ryanair (including the 
LaudaMotion unit) plummeted 79% to 32.7 million.3. Due to pandemic-induced dwindling air-travel demand,Gol 
Linhas' traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers, plummeted 50.3% year over year in February. With 
travel demand falling below the year-ago levels, the company reduced its capacity significantly. In February, 
capacity measured in available seat kilometers contracted 50.4%. Since traffic decline and capacity contraction is 
almost at par, load factor was unchanged on a year-over-year basis at 80.8%. Gol Linhas' total monthly departures 
slumped 53.2% and seats tanked 52.6%.4. Per the International Air Transport Association[8], total air-travel 
demand or traffic in January 2021 tanked 72% year over year. Moreover, the reading was worse than the 69.7% 
year-over-year slump recorded in Dec 2020. On the domestic front, demand was down 47.4% versus the pre-
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL 's Order for Boeing 737 MAX Jets, GOL 's Traffic Report & More
pandemic (January 2019) levels. In December 2020, it was down 42.9%. The downside was mainly due to stricter 
domestic travel controls in China over the Lunar New Year holiday period. In international markets, passenger 
demand in January was 85.6% below that witnessed in January 2019. Price Performance The following table shows 
the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The table above 
shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
declined 1% over the past week to $102.92. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker surged 69.3%. 
What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will look forward to the February traffic reports from the likes of Allegiant 
Travel Company ALGT[9] and Azul AZUL[10]. Time to Invest in Legal Marijuana If you're looking for big gains, there 
couldn't be a better time to get in on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion back in 2019 to an 
expected $73.6 billion by 2027.After a clean sweep of 6 election referendums in 5 states, pot is now legal in 36 
states plus D.C. Federal legalization is expected soon and that could be a still greater bonanza for investors. Even
