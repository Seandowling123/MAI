For example, the possible approach for Sainsbury means that the other supermarket groups including Morrison, 
Tesco and Carrefour need re-rating and the companies seen in terms of their property assets, says JP Morgan.
It increases its target price for Morrisons from 315 to 360p, and on Tesco from 425p to 460p, but remains neutral. 
Carrefour is upgraded from underweight to neutral and the target price increased from 43 to 48.
The broker is meanwhile neutral on Buzzi Unicem.

Seymour Pierce says the interest in Sainsbury, which it rates as a sell, means that the other supermarket groups 
need re-rating, but it is meanwhile maintaining its outperform ratings on Tesco and Morrisons.

Ryanair profit forecast increased as passengers spend more

Passengers are spending more than they used to aboard Ryanair because they are happy to avoid the obligatory 
fuel tax found on rival airlines, chief executive Michael O'Leary says.
'It reflects the impact of competitors excessive and unjustified fuel surcharges, O'Leary said, while noting that the 
revenue from checked baggage charges was another component to higher yield per passenger.
Baggage charges were introduced last March and do not appear in the comparative figures for last year, helping to 
boost third-quarter results to December higher than they would be otherwise.
The impact is expected to decline as passengers reduce their luggage in response to the charges.
This ancillary revenue growth of 61%, significantly faster than traffic growth, helped Europe's largest no-frills airline 
increase net profits 30% to 48 million in the quarter.
Looking to the fourth quarter, passenger volumes are expected to increase by 25%. Earnings in the fourth quarter 
will be helped by weakening spot oil prices, reducing the cost of the 10% of fuel not already hedged at $73 per 
barrel, the chief executive says.
'As a result of this better-than-expected performance in the second half, we expect that Ryanair's net profit after tax 
for the fiscal year ended 31 March, which we previously guided to rise 16% to 350 million, will in fact rise by 
approximately 29% to 390 million,' he added.
The shares added 6.57% rising 0.738 to 11.958.
O'Leary said Ryanair (RYA) increased its holding in Aer Lingus to 25.2% in November as it pursues its takeover 
bid. The offer has since been referred to the European Union Commission.
He is convinced that its bid will get the regulatory all-clear because the offer will result in lower fares, reduced fuel 
charges, an improved fleet of aircraft and better services.
Ryanair carried 10.3 million passengers in the third quarter, an increase of 19%. Total yields were 7% higher, 
increasing total revenue by a third to 493 million. Besides the higher passenger spend, the increased revenue came 
from better services and the receipt of a one-off settlement arising from an early contract termination by Ryanair's 
hotel partner.
Ryanair profit forecast increased as passengers spend more
Unit costs rose 14% as fuel increased 52% to 175 million and now accounts for 40% of total costs. Despite the 
higher fuel bill, net margins were maintained at 10%, ahead of expectations.
Ryanair is 90% hedged on fuel to 31 March at $73 per barrel. It is just over 50% hedged through to the first half of 
next year, and 90% hedged through the second half of 2008 at 10% less than it paid this year.
O'Leary says that hedging at these rates has allowed the airline to save around 60 million for the coming year.
On the baggage charges issue he says that increasing numbers of passengers are arriving later at airports, 
bypassing check in queues and proceeding directly to the boarding gate, where they are priority boarded and have 
their choice of seats.
'We anticipate that the baggage charges will encourage passengers to travel with fewer checked bags thereby 
reducing the revenues from this source, and more importantly, reducing baggage handling costs' he said.
Shareholders have approved a two-for-one stock split which will be implemented on 26 February.

Broker notes helped wake initially listless traders after an early stocks dip influenced by little more than Friday's 
mixed overnight close on Wall Street.
The FTSE 100 hit an 8:08 am low of 6,294.7, down 15.8 points, but an upgrade from neutral to buy by broker UBS 
for Johnson, Matthey livened the proceeding and the specialist chemical group went to the top of the leader board 
with a 65p jump to £15.57, up 4.36%.
Broker comment also helped Cable & Wireless, 5.5p up to 177p, and BT, 9.25p better at 318.25p, taking them to 
the second and third spots on the leader board.
The FTSE 100 at 8:59 am it peaked at 6,319.3 up 8.8 points. After mixed starts the other key indices also moved 
higher. At 9:55 am the FTSE 100 was 5.2 points better at 6,316.1.
Initially the market followed the Dow Jones industrial index, which ended 20.19 points lower at 12,653.49 on Friday, 
with retail sector speculation dominated by Sainsbury bid talk offset by weaker mining shares following falls in base 
metal prices.
Sainsbury, Tesco and Morrison were among the most active shares in the first hour each adding 2.75p to 510p, 
437.75p and 303.5p respectively. Tesco later fell to 434.875, down 0.125p, but the other two stayed among the 
leaders.
Copper specialist Antofagasta was the biggest losing miner, down 3.5p to 463p, but Kazakhmys was also down, 3p 
lower at £10.61. Rio, Xstrata and BHP Billiton all fell in early deals, but soon recovered.
Other features included hedge fund specialist Man, up 18.625p to 565.375p after broker Credit Suisse lifted both its 
price target and profit forecast, and Game Group, down 0.625p to 146.875p after Altium Securities downgraded the 
shares from buy to hold largely because of the high price of the new Sony Play Station 3.
After the recommended bid from Barratt Developments, up 52p to £12.80, Wilson Bowden shares fell 41p to 
£22.72, still 25p over the agreed price.
Ryanair shares jumped 5.97% to 11.89, up 0.67 after the profit outlook for the year was increased by 40 million to 
390 million following the 30% jump in net profit for the third quarter.

In Frankfurt, the German DAX 30 was down 15.12 points at 10 am with E.ON and MAN the most notable risers and 
Infineon and Lufthansa the biggest losers.
In Paris at 10:21 am, 11 of the top 40 stocks were up, 27 down and two unchanged leaving the French CAC-40 
down 6.39 points at 5,670.91.
The US dollar held relatively firm in Asian markets overnight, a mood picked up in Europe where the pound fell from 
$1.9659 to $1.9605 in early dealing and the euro from 1.2961 to 1.2943.

Ryanair posted a 30pc jump in third-quarter net profit today, confounding analyst expectations for a fall.
The no-frills airline also ramped up its full-year profit goal while predicting big fuel-cost savings for the following 
year.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said profit after tax rose to E47.7 million in the three months to end December 
from E36.8 million in the same period of 2005, against analyst expectations that they would fall by over 60pc.
 The company said it had hedged much of its fuel requirements for its 2007/2008 business year at 10pc less than it 
is currently paying, meaning savings on fuel costs for the coming year of E60 million.

NCB Stockbrokers has predicted a slide in Ryanair's earnings during the third quarter with the results expected later 
today.
NCB forecasts that increased seasonality and the effects of higher fuel costs will erode sales and profits with net 
income coming in at around E4.3 million.
Ryanair traffic figures grew by 19.1pc in the third quarter, with load factors largely unchanged and average fares 
estimated to have risen by 4pc, ahead of the 2pc to 3pc guided in November by the company.
 "Given the maintenance of surcharges by the flag carriers on short-haul European services, this may offer scope 
for upside. Average fares rose by 5.7pc in the second quarter despite the disruption caused by the August 2006 
security alerts - in part reflecting the successful introduction of baggage charges last March. If second-quarter yield 
trends continued into the period under review, it would boost net income from E4.3m to E10.2m," according to NCB 
Stockbrokers analyst John Sheehan.

Shares on the Dublin market soared more than 100 points today for the second day running today, with Anglo Irish 
Bank and CRH leading the way.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 139.96 points to 9,490.39 - just shy of an all-time closing high. The sharp 
gains meant the market was up 200 points on the week.
Anglo Irish Bank was up 15c to 16.20 after it told shareholders at its AGM that it had enjoyed a strong to its financial 
year across all its businesses. Other financial shares also moved slightly higher, with AIB up 4c to 22.59, Bank of 
Ireland up 8c to 17.53 and Irish Life and Permanent up 55c to 21.30.
 Even a mixed start on Wall Street failed to knock investor sentiment in Dublin. U.S stocks endured a cautious 
opening few hours as the market digested a weaker-than-expected employment report that curbed investors' bullish 
sentiment following three days of straight gains. The January jobs report, which showed the country's 
unemployment rate at a four-month high of 4.6pc, beat expectations of 4.5pc rate. On the ISEQ, CRH was a 
notable mover, up 42c to 31.22, despite newspaper reports that it is being sued for USD120m in the US over claims 
of abuse of its dominant position in New York to acquire a competitor, Port Dock, at a price "far below fair market 
value". CRH has rejected the allegations as "totally baseless". Elsewhere in the construction sector, Grafton jumped 
23c to 12.30, while McInerney fell 13c to 15.36. Kingspan added on an impressive 39c to 20.00. Fyffes spin-off 
Total Produce announced today that it is to form a joint venture company in India with Tata Chemicals. The new 
company aims to set up distribution facilities for fresh fruit and vegetables across the sub-continent. Shares in Total 
were down 1c at 0.71. Ryanair was up 22c to 11.22 after it won a landmark court case on Thursday against a 
judgement that gave the Irish Labour Court the right to investigate a row between the airline and its pilots. The 
Supreme Court in Dublin quashed the decision that the Labour Court could intervene in disputes within the low-fare 
carrier. Shares in Trinity Biotech were up 6c to 1.78 after it announced a partnership with Community Healthcare 
Network (CHN) to introduce its one step HIV test across health clinics in New York. Trinity is a developer and 
ISEQ soars 140 points on Anglo & CRH
manufacturer of diagnostic products for the point-of-care and clinical laboratory markets. Community Healthcare 
Network (CHN) is a not-for-profit organisation providing access to health services to over 60,000 people a year 
throughout New York City. Elsewhere, shares in pharmaceutical group Elan soared 10pc, or 93c to 10.23, while 
Paddy Power jumped 13c to 17.28. UTV lost 7c to 6.13, while CandC returned to negative ways, slipping 4c to

Body
Ryanair has won its appeal challenging the right of the Labour Court to investigate complaints by the airline's pilots.
The Supreme Court found that procedures used by the Labour Court in its preliminary hearing were flawed, and has 
ordered a re-hearing of the case, though with full court procedures to ensure that the rights of all parties - including 
the employer - are protected.
Ryanair has welcomed the ruling, but IMPACT, which took the case on behalf of the pilots, expressed 
disappointment. But the union welcomed the fact that a re-hearing had been ordered.
 Under new legislation introduced in 2004, workers in companies which do not recognise unions can have their 
grievances investigated by the Labour Court - with or without the participation of the employer in question. Ryanair 
had argued that the legislation was never intended to apply to what it called 'high-pay multi-nationals', and had 
accused the new legislation of introducing compulsory union recognition by the back door.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest no-frills airline, won a Supreme Court appeal Thursday against its unhappy 
pilots and the labor union seeking to represent them.
Ireland's highest court ruled that a major venue for adjudicating employment disputes, the Labour Court, had been 
wrong to decide it had the power to handle a case between Ryanair and IMPACT, a union that represents pilots and 
cabin crew but whose authority Ryanair rejects.
The judgment, which overturned a 2005 High Court ruling in favor of the pilots and union, could have significant 
implications for the power of organized labor versus multinational, non-union companies operating in Ireland.
Ryanair directors praised the judgment as vindicating the company's insistence that it negotiate directly with 
employees, not through unions.
"Ryanair's people prefer direct negotiation because it has brought higher pay, rapid promotions, better job security 
and better conditions," said Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's personnel director.
The ruling, he said, meant recognition of unions "cannot be imposed through the back door against the wishes of 
employees and high-pay multinationals."
Since 2004, Ryanair's pilots have filed more than 250 individual complaints to mediators against the company, 
claiming either personal victimization or violation of their constitutional right to union representation. Pilots 
sometimes quip that Ryanair's human resources unit is in the Four Courts, a landmark Dublin courthouse.
Thursday's ruling dealt a blow to a 2004 law that was enacted, in part, to give the Labour Court more power to 
handle cases involving non-union companies.
It said the Labour Court, and the High Court that defended its jurisdiction, had not given enough credit to Ryanair's 
system of internal collective bargaining with employees.

"This legislation was not designed for 40 pilots earning more than €100,000 (US$125,000) a year to impose their 
will on 3,500 other people employed across Europe by Ryanair," the airline said in a statement.
IMPACT officials accused Ryanair of distorting the true figures, and insisted that Ryanair pilots were badly paid and 
treated versus those employed by other international airlines.
The Supreme Court also ruled that the Labour Court had been wrong to permit the complaining Ryanair pilots to 
keep their identities confidential and not be cross-examined in open court. It said any future hearing of the dispute 
must involve a fully fledged civil court.
Michael McLaughlin, an official at the Irish Airlines Pilot Association, an IMPACT-linked group of pilots at Ryanair 
and rival Aer Lingus, said Ryanair pilots feared losing their jobs if they went down this route.
"It would be a very foolish Ryanair pilot who put his name out. The consequences would be very serious," said 
McLaughlin, who like other Irish Airlines Pilot Association officials is a pilot at Aer Lingus, which recognizes unions.
The dispute began in 2004 when Ryanair began training pilots how to operate the newest model of Boeing 737-800 
aircraft. Pilots disputed the new work requirements involved and sent IMPACT representatives to negotiate on their 
behalf, but Ryanair refused. Ultimately, the pilots paid their own training costs of approximately €15,000 
(US$20,000) each rather than accept a Ryanair offer that required them to abandon their other lawsuits in 
exchange.

Budget airlines take root in Middle East

Body
Gulf Arab countries, shedding their traditional reputation for opulence, are the latest to join the phenomenon of no-
frills budget airlines that have transformed air travel in Europe and America.
The three chief Mideast budget airlines Air Arabia, Jazeera Airways and Atlas Blue have already grabbed 5 percent 
of the region's air travel market, and analysts say that portion is set to increase in coming years as booming Gulf 
economies attract more fliers.
Despite the Gulf's luxury-obsessed reputation, there is a healthy market for low-cost flights, said Habib Fekih, 
president of Airbus Middle East, a unit of the European aircraft manufacturer.
"Many people have this perception of the Gulf as being dedicated to anything first class, but this is not true," Fekih 
said. "A big part of the population in this part of the world need low fares. They are either Asian laborers or Western 
expatriates whose number is increasing because of the region's booming economies."
Like Europe's easyJet and Ryanair, and America's Southwest Airlines, budget carriers in the Middle East are 
connecting mid-sized cities that may otherwise have no direct links.
Common destinations include Egypt's central city of Assiut and coastal city of Sharm el Sheik; Almaty in 
Kazakhstan; Iran's holy city Mashhad; Syria's ancient cities of Aleppo and Damascus; Yerevan, Armenia; and small 
cities in India, like Kochi and Nagpur.
Mideast budget airlines offer services similar to their U.S. counterparts, from guaranteed seats and meals for 
purchase on board to free checked luggage up to 44 pounds. Jazeera offers a "Jazeera Plus" business-class 
equivalent. That's considerably less luxurious than carriers like Emirates, which fly global routes and are known for 
first-class service.
On shared destinations, budget airlines are far cheaper than full service airlines. Emirates airlines charges $540 for 
a round-trip from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram, India. The same trip from Sharjah on Air Arabia costs $266. A 
round trip ticket from Kuwait City to Mumbai, India, costs $800 on Kuwait Airways and $240 on Jazeera.
Budget airlines take root in Middle East
Aviation experts say budget carriers' success stems from the easing of government restrictions on competition. 
Deregulation that has sparked competition in the Gulf still has a long way to go in some markets. Budget airlines 
are still banned from operating to Cairo, said Abdul Wahab Teffaha, secretary-general of the Arab Air Carriers 
Organization, a Lebanon-based industry advocacy group.
"In the Arab world, liberalization is a gradual move toward easing restrictions. We are heading in that direction, but I 
cannot say we are totally there yet," Teffaha said.
Sharjah-based Air Arabia, the oldest and largest of the Arab world's three budget airlines, saw its passenger 
numbers increase from 500,000 in 2004 to 1.8 million passengers last year, said Adel Ali, Air Arabia's chief 
executive. The fast-growing airline has transformed Sharjah's once bucolic airport, ferrying passengers to 31 
destinations, including faraway cities in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Sudan.
The company began operating in late 2003 with two aircraft and a $13 million grant from the government of 
Sharjah, a conservative emirate overshadowed by its freewheeling neighbor, Dubai.
Air Arabia now owns nine aircraft and plans to go public, selling 55 percent of its shares this year, Ali said. The 
Sharjah government will retain 45 percent ownership.
The airline expects to report 2006 profits significantly higher than the $8.8 million it made in 2005, Ali said.
Air Arabia is not the only budget player plying busy routes in the Middle East.
Kuwait-based Jazeera Airways, the only private airline in the Middle East, grew from two planes and five 
destinations in October 2005 to four aircraft flying to 12 destinations last year, said Marwan Boodai, Jazeera's chief 
executive. Jazeera carried about 500,000 passengers last year, he said.
A third budget carrier, Marrakech, Morocco-based Atlas Blue, established in 2004, caters to European tourists 
linking 15 European cities with Marrakech.
Low-cost carriers from outside are also breaking into the market. In 2005, Air India launched Air India Express, a 
no-frills operation connecting India to the Mideast. Air India Express started with 14 flights a week from India to Abu 
Dhabi, the Emirates' capital, and has since expanded to 50 a week, said Dubai-based regional director F.J. Vaz. In 
addition to the Emirates, the Indian carrier connects Bahrain and two cities in Oman to several cities in India.
Saudi Arabia is in the process of granting traffic rights to two budget airlines, Sama and National Air Services.
Despite the flurry of activity, JP Morgan's Peter Negline said the Mideast budget air travel market is still in its 
infancy.
"They're in a position to stimulate a lot of traffic," said Negline, a Hong Kong-based airline analyst.
Budget airlines are hampered by their reliance on Internet sales and credit cards, said Danvir Khawaja, managing 
director of Arabian Travels agency in Dubai.
"Budget airlines still make their best offers online but most people in this part of the world still prefer to deal with 
another human being," he said. "People are also less comfortable using their credit cards." But he expects people 
in time will become more comfortable dealing with budget airlines.

Gulf Arab countries, shedding their traditional reputation for opulence, are the latest to join the phenomenon of no-
frills budget airlines that have transformed air travel in Europe and America.
The three chief Mideast budget airlines Air Arabia, Jazeera Airways and Atlas Blue have already grabbed 5 percent 
of the region's air travel market, and analysts say that portion is set to increase in coming years as booming Gulf 
economies attract more fliers.
Despite the Gulf's luxury-obsessed reputation, there is a healthy market for low-cost flights, said Habib Fekih, 
president of Airbus Middle East, a unit of the European aircraft manufacturer.
"Many people have this perception of the Gulf as being dedicated to anything first class, but this is not true," Fekih 
said. "A big part of the population in this part of the world need low fares. They are either Asian laborers or Western 
expatriates whose number is increasing because of the region's booming economies."
Like Europe's easyJet and Ryanair, and America's Southwest Airlines, budget carriers in the Middle East are 
connecting mid-sized cities that may otherwise have no direct links.
Common destinations include Egypt's central city of Assiut and coastal city of Sharm el Sheik; Almaty in 
Kazakhstan; Iran's holy city Mashhad; Syria's ancient cities of Aleppo and Damascus; Yerevan, Armenia; and small 
cities in India, like Kochi and Nagpur.
Mideast budget airlines offer services similar to their U.S. counterparts, from guaranteed seats and meals for 
purchase on board to free checked luggage up to 44 pounds. Jazeera offers a "Jazeera Plus" business-class 
equivalent. That's considerably less luxurious than carriers like Emirates, which fly global routes and are known for 
first-class service.
On shared destinations, budget airlines are far cheaper than full service airlines. Emirates airlines charges $540 for 
a round-trip from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram, India. The same trip from Sharjah on Air Arabia costs $266. A 
round trip ticket from Kuwait City to Mumbai, India, costs $800 on Kuwait Airways and $240 on Jazeera.
Budget airlines take root in Middle East
Aviation experts say budget carriers' success stems from the easing of government restrictions on competition. 
Deregulation that has sparked competition in the Gulf still has a long way to go in some markets. Budget airlines 
are still banned from operating to Cairo, said Abdul Wahab Teffaha, secretary-general of the Arab Air Carriers 
Organization, a Lebanon-based industry advocacy group.
"In the Arab world, liberalization is a gradual move toward easing restrictions. We are heading in that direction, but I 
cannot say we are totally there yet," Teffaha said.
Sharjah-based Air Arabia, the oldest and largest of the Arab world's three budget airlines, saw its passenger 
numbers increase from 500,000 in 2004 to 1.8 million passengers last year, said Adel Ali, Air Arabia's chief 
executive. The fast-growing airline has transformed Sharjah's once bucolic airport, ferrying passengers to 31 
destinations, including faraway cities in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Sudan.
The company began operating in late 2003 with two aircraft and a $13 million grant from the government of 
Sharjah, a conservative emirate overshadowed by its freewheeling neighbor, Dubai.
Air Arabia now owns nine aircraft and plans to go public, selling 55 percent of its shares this year, Ali said. The 
Sharjah government will retain 45 percent ownership.
The airline expects to report 2006 profits significantly higher than the $8.8 million it made in 2005, Ali said.
Air Arabia is not the only budget player plying busy routes in the Middle East.
Kuwait-based Jazeera Airways, the only private airline in the Middle East, grew from two planes and five 
destinations in October 2005 to four aircraft flying to 12 destinations last year, said Marwan Boodai, Jazeera's chief 
executive. Jazeera carried about 500,000 passengers last year, he said.
A third budget carrier, Marrakech, Morocco-based Atlas Blue, established in 2004, caters to European tourists 
linking 15 European cities with Marrakech.
Low-cost carriers from outside are also breaking into the market. In 2005, Air India launched Air India Express, a 
no-frills operation connecting India to the Mideast. Air India Express started with 14 flights a week from India to Abu 
Dhabi, the Emirates' capital, and has since expanded to 50 a week, said Dubai-based regional director F.J. Vaz. In

Shares on the Dublin market soared by more than 140 points today, with financial shares leading the charge.
Having performed sluggishly for much of the week, the ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 145.27 points higher at 
9,350.43.
The market traded sharply higher early in the session after the US Federal Reserve voted overnight to keep interest 
rates unchanged at 5.25pc for the fifth month in a row.
 Investor sentiment in Dublin was also boosted by a strong opening across the Atlantic. US stocks rose in early 
trading after an already buoyant Wall Street received word that consumer spending rose at a healthy clip in 
December and as corporate profit reports remained strong. The increase came a day after Wall Street put on its 
best performance of the year, rising sharply after the Federal Reserve signalled the economy remained solid and 
that inflation was largely in check. Market players in the US brushed off a weak manufacturing survey and now 
await key non-farm payrolls data, due out tomorrow. The financial sector was the star performer in Dublin, with AIB 
up 42c to 22.55, Bank of Ireland up 31c to 22.55 and Irish Life and Permanent up 15c to 20.75. Anglo Irish Bank 
was also in the black, up 23c to 15.74, after it announced plans to raise capital by placing 35.7 million new shares 
on the market. Davy Stockbrokers described the placement as 'a massive vote of confidence'. Just under 13 million 
shares changed hands on the news. The new shares represent around 5pc of the company's share capital, but the 
final price will depend on demand. Chief executive David Drumm said the money raised would put it in an 'excellent 
position' to continue growing strongly. Anglo Irish is due to release its AGM statement tomorrow. Elsewhere on the 
market, CandC offered hope that it is set to return to positive ways, closing in the black for the second day running. 
Shares in the Bulmers owner have endured a miserable start to the year, however, shares closed 37c higher at 
11.75 in Dublin. In the construction sector, CRH led the way, up an impressive 50c to 30.80, while Grafton added 
on 22c to 12.07 and Kingspan jumped 24c to 19.61. McInerney managed to buck the trend, falling 8c to 15.49. 
Buoyant banks lift ISEQ 145pts higher
Dragon Oil's strong start to 2007 continued, up 12c to 2.80, while Aer Lingus added on 10c to 2.90. Greencore 
jumped 16c to 4.33. No frills airline Ryanair was up 13c to 11.00 after the Supreme Court overturned a decision that 
gave the Labour Court the right to investigate a row between Ryanair and its pilots. Other notable movers included 
UTV, up 16c to 6.20, Petroceltic, up 1c to 0.22, and Kerry Group, up 7c to 19.84.

Body
Trade union IMPACT has expressed its disappointment at the decision of the Supreme Court to overturn a decision 
that gave the Labour Court the right to investigate a row between Ryanair and its pilots.
Ireland's highest court today ruled that the Labour Court had been wrong to decide it had the power to handle a 
case between Ryanair and IMPACT, the union that represents pilots and cabin crew - but whose authority Ryanair 
rejects.
However, IMPACT claims the decision to be nothing more than "a temporary setback"
 IMPACT said it was looking forward to an early rehearing. "We believe we have a very strong case which we will 
present to the Labour Court, in full accordance with the guidelines and principles laid down by the Supreme Court 
today," said IMPACT official Michael Landers. IMPACT initially took the pilots' case to the Labour Court under the 
2004 Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which doesn't compel companies to recognise unions. 
However, the act does give the Labour Court powers to make binding rulings against non-union firms in certain 
circumstances. Ryanair said the ruling meant recognition of unions "cannot be imposed through the back door 
against the wishes of employees and high-pay multinationals."

Ryanair's complaints, which have been filed with the Conseil d'Etat in France and the European Commission,

Body
Financial shares weighed heavy on the Dublin market for the second consecutive day today, after an EU report 
found that retail banking in many member states, including Ireland, is still lacking genuine competition.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the day 82.87 points lower at 9,205.16.
Banks were the biggest losers with Irish Life and Permanent, down 44c to 20.60, AIB down 10c to 22.12 and Anglo 
Irish Bank down 23c to 15.51. Bank of Ireland lost 16c to 17.14.
 The shares took a tumble after the European Commission's final report of its competition inquiry into the retail 
banking sector revealed several competition concerns in the markets for credit cards, payment systems and retail 
banking products. In relation to the Irish market, the Commission said the rules here are still obstructing foreign 
banks who want to break into the market. The EU said it "will make full use of its powers under competition law to 
tackle these barriers, in the market for payment cards and elsewhere". It also said that credit card charges in 
Ireland may still be higher than they should be. The findings were backed up by Bank of Scotland (Ireland), who 
said the report "vindicates its opinion that the main banks continue to use their market position to limit competition". 
The bad news from Brussels added to investor caution ahead of the US rate decision, due later tonight. US stocks 
endured an edgy early session with investors sidelined ahead of the Federal Reserve rate decision, but better-than-
expected GDP data and numbers from Boeing helped shore up sentiment. The Federal Reserve was widely tipped 
to keep rates unchanged at 5.25pc, although it was expected to adopt a more hawkish tone going forward. Back in 
Dublin, construction shares were also lower, with CRH down 23c to 30.30, Grafton down 15c to 11.85, Kingspan 
down 3c to 19.37 and McInerney down 21c to 15.57. Elsewhere, C and C managed modest gains, up 11c to 11.38, 
with shares in the company having plummeted since the turn of the year following a broker downgrade. The star 
performer of the session was undoubtedly UTV, up 42c to 6.04, while Iona Technologies jumped 10c to 4.10. Aer 
Lingus lost 4c to 2.80. No frills airline Ryanair slipped 25c to 10.87 as it prepares to publish its results for the three 
months to the end of December on Monday. Brokers are forecasting operating profit and earnings per share of E40 
ISEQ down 82 as banks fall into the red
million and 4c respectively, representing year on year declines of 18pc and 14pc. The lower profitability is the result 
of a significant in increase in fuel costs. Other notable movers included Horizon, up 5c to 1.03, Elan, down 4c to 
9.49, Greencore, down 7c to 4.17, and Irish Continental Group, down 9c to 15.85.

European equity markets ended higher yesterday, shrugging off early losses, as airline stocks were lifted by merger 
and acquisition activity and industrial groups gained on earnings expectations.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 0.3 per cent to 1,522.27.
Air France-KLM led the gains in the airline sector after it showed no interest in the sale of shares in Italian rival 
Alitalia, with which it has a strategic partnership.
Shares in the Franco-Dutch carrier rose 7.2 per cent to Euros 35.01 after it said conditions were not right for a bid. 
Analysts suggested the market was relieved Air France had decided against the move and that it would concentrate 
on developing synergies from its merger with KLM.
Alitalia jumped 3.6 per cent to Euros 1.13 after receiving 11 expressions of interest. Potential bidders included 
private equity groups Texas Pacific Group Ventures and Terra Firma Investments, as well as the investment 
banking arm of Italy's Unicredit.
Investors bought into the rest of the sector on theback of lower oil prices and recent upgrades. Germany's 
Lufthansa added 1.8 per cent to Euros 21.76, while Spain's Iberia climbed 2.3 per cent to Euros 3.17. Irish budget 
carrier Ryanair was up 8 per cent to Euros 11.12.
Swedish heavyweights Sandvik and Atlas Copco figured highly on the Eurofirst 300 leaderboard as their shares 
were snapped upon expectations that they will report strong results tomorrow. The speculation was driven by record 
fourth-quarter earnings from sector and domestic peer SKF, the world's biggest maker of bearings, which also said 
it planned a shareholder payout of SKr6.6bn.
Shares in SKF rose 7.3 per cent to SKr139.50. Sandvik, which makes tools and machinery for the mining industry, 
added 5.5 per cent to SKr110 and Atlas Copco, the world's biggest maker of air compressors, rose 3.9 per cent to 
SKr228.

Siemens gained 5 per cent to Euros 85.50 after the German conglomerate was upgraded by a number of brokers 
following its stronger-than-expected results last week.
Hypo Real Estate, theGerman property lender, reported full-year earnings that met with market expectations, but 
the shares fell 2.7 per cent to Euros 50.75 as investors took profits after a six-week run that lifted the stock by 19 
per cent.
Belgacom fell 1.9 per cent to Euros 34.17 after it was downgraded by Rabobank from "hold" to "reduce". The broker 
said the company's recent strong share price performance had been overdone.
The broader sector recovered some poise after Monday's profit warning from Deutsche Telekom. D Telekom 
shares were down0.1 per cent to Euros 13.59, while France Telecom recouped0.5 per cent to Euros 21.29 and 
Telecom Italia rallied 0.7 per cent to Euros 2.29.

BAA seeks approval for second Stansted runway AIRPORT EXPANSION
BAA seeks approval for second Stansted runway AIRPORT EXPANSION

Body
BAA, the UK airports operator, is planning to build a second runway at London Stansted airport in a Pounds 2.45bn 
project with the first phase to be ready by 2015.
Under the proposal, capacity would more than double to 68m passengers a year by 2030, the same number of 
passengers handled by London Heathrow last year.
The latest scheme, published yesterday and to be submitted by BAA for planning permission in the early autumn, is 
expected to run into fierce opposition from environmental and local residents' groups and local authorities in Essex 
and Hertfordshire.
If approved, the runway would be the first full-length one in 50 years to be added in the south-east of England, one 
of the most congested regions of Europe.
BAA, which was taken over last summer by a consortium led by Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, infrastructure 
and services group, said it hoped a planning inquiry would start in the spring or summer of 2008.
Alastair McDermid, director of the Stansted Generation 2 project, said BAA expected the planning in-quiry to last up 
to two years, which would allow for final approval to be granted by the government in 2011 with the first phase of 
the project to be completed in 2015.
Last year, the government confirmed that it still fully supported the expansion of airport capacity in the UK, in spite 
of opposition from environmental campaigners, who claim that aviation is the fastest growing source of climate-
change gases.
It confirmed its backing for the December 2003 aviation white paper, which called for the building of two new 
runways in the south-east of England, led by a second runway at Stansted. This was to be followed by a third short 
runway at London Heathrow, provided tough local environmental obstacles could be overcome.
BAA seeks approval for second Stansted runway AIRPORT EXPANSION
The government said last month it would launch a public consultation this year on the more intensive use of the 
existing two runways at Heathrow and on the building of the third runway and a sixth passenger terminal. The first 
phase of the current Pounds 4.5bn project for a fifth terminal is due to open at the end of March next year.
The Office of Fair Trading is expected to confirm shortly that it will call for a full investigation of the UK airports 
market by the Competition Commission, which could lead to the break-up of BAA's London airports monopoly. Last 
month the Civil Aviation Authority, the airports' economic regulator, said it was considering recommending to the 
government the end of the price cap regime at Stansted, with charges to be set through commercial negotiations.
Airport charges at Stansted will have to rise steeply to support the investment despite the opposition of leading 
operators at the airport led by Ryanair and EasyJet, but Mr McDermid said: "We still think that revenues from 
Stansted alone should be enough to remunerate the investment."
The Department for Transport forecast last month that the number of passengers using UK airports would double

Body
BAA PLC, the British airports operator controlled by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, unveiled plans Tuesday to develop 
a less costly second runway at London's Stansted airport than originally planned.
The belt-tightening will extend the building time on the project, with the runway now expected to be operational in 
2015, two years later than originally planned. BAA said it has cut envisaged opening costs for the runway and 
terminal building by 17.5 percent to 1.4 billion pounds (US$2.8 billion; €2.2 billion), with the amount of land required 
down by 22 percent on BAA's December 2005 estimate.
BAA has faced strong opposition from airlines using Stansted about its second runway plans amid fears that high 
development costs will lead to increased airport charges.
One of its most vocal opponents is Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, who has labeled the planned terminal 
building a "gold-plated Taj Mahal."
O'Leary said Tuesday that BAA's revised plans were still far too expensive and supported calls for the airports 
operator to be broken up "and allow competition to deliver where a regulated monopoly has clearly failed."
"At a time when a low-cost efficient airport like Frankfurt Hahn can design and build a 15 million passenger terminal 
for less than €100 million (US$130 million), there is no justification for the BAA airport monopoly to waste 1.4 billion 
pounds on a similar-sized terminal facility," he added.
The British government estimated the cost of the overall development of Stansted's new runway, terminal and 
improved public transport access at around 4 billion pounds (US$7.9 billion; €6.1 billion) in 2003. BAA now expects 
the full development of Stansted to cost some 2.2 billion pounds (US$4.3 billion; €3.3 billion) when it's completed in 
2030.
BAA said the new runway will allow for an extra 10 million passengers a year at Stansted, set to rise to 68 million 
when the airport is fully developed, covering nearly 500 hectares of land.
BAA unveils plans for less costly 2nd runway at Stansted; airlines remain opposed
It has to win over support for its new plans from local legislators it was forced back to the drawing board when a 
local council voted against its earlier proposal two months ago.
"Our job is to balance cost-effectiveness with our responsibility to build a runway which is in line with the 
environmental constraints, which reflects the fact that, of course, there is going to be local opposition to building a 
runway in Essex," said BAA Chief Executive Stephen Nelson.
Carol Barbone, campaign director of Stop Stansted Expansion, which has mounted a lengthy campaign against the 
project, said protesters would continue their fight.
"They may have cut the costs and trimmed the land take, but this doesn't change our position," Barbone said. 
"There is overwhelming opposition to a second runway in any location. The fact that BAA is now trying to cut costs 
to please its airline customers doesn't make any difference."
Britain's Office of Fair Trading said last month that it plans to ask the Competition Commission to conduct a detailed 
probe into BAA's position in the airport market, particularly its stranglehold in London.
BAA owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports in London, Southampton in southeast England and Edinburgh, 
Glasgow and Aberdeen in Scotland. The seven airports combined handle 63 percent of travelers to and from 
Britain, a figure that rises to 86 percent in Scotland and to 92 percent in London.

The Dublin market slipped into the red today, with major financials weighing heavy.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 34.35 points lower at 9,288.03.
Investor sentiment was hit by a cautious start to the day on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy 
body began its two-day meeting on interest rates in the U.S.
 A decision is expected tomorrow afternoon. The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 
5.25pc, however, some sections of the market are predicting hawkish comment from the central bank. Markets 
have scaled back expectations of near-term rate cuts in the US over the past weeks after some strong US data. 
The uncertainty over the Fed decision had a detrimental effect on financial shares in Dublin today, with Bank of 
Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank both closing more than 1pc lower, down 22c to 17.30 and 15.74 respectively. 
Elsewhere in the sector, AIB slipped 3c to 22.22, while Irish Life and Permanent managed to buck the trend, falling 
12c to 21.04. Shares in Ryanair closed 9c higher at 11.12 despite reports that it is to be investigate by French over 
its routes in France. Reports emanating from France claim that Marseilles prosecutors are to probe the low-cost 
airline after it failed to obtain authorisation for new routes between Marseilles and Morocco last November before 
offering tickets for sale. Over 40 complaints have been made accusing the company of selling promotional tickets 
before getting the green light for the routes. Ryanair is due to announce its results for the three months to the end of 
December on Monday next. Dolmen is forecasting operating profit and earnings per share of E40 million and 4c 
respectively, representing year on year declines of 18pc and 14pc. The lower profitability is the result of a significant 
in increase in fuel costs. Such a result would keep the airline on course to report operating profit and earnings per 
share of E430 million and 47c respectively. Elsewhere, C and C recovered from sharp falls early in the session to 
close just 3c lower at 11.20, while Iona Technologies fell 14c to 4.00 on profit taking after it said last week that 
profits tripled in the fourth-quarter of last year. The firm reported total revenue of USD77.8m for last year, an 
increase of 17pc compared with 2005. In the construction sector, CRH was down 22c to 30.53, Grafton slipped 4c

to 12.00 and Kingspan added on 1c to 19.40. McInerney closed 7c lower at 15.78. Other notable movers included 
Aer Lingus, up 1c to 2.84, CPL Resources, up 28c to 6.98, Elan, up 8c to 9.53, and Irish Continental Group, up 3c 
to 15.94. Meanwhile, Independent News and Media jumped 1c to 3.03 after India's media market regulator rejected 
a proposal by the Irish firm to raise its stake in Indian publisher Jagran Prakashan Ltd. Independent already owns 
20.8pc of Jagran, and had been seeking to raise its stake by between 1 and 3pc.

From John McFall MP.
Sir, I was interested to read the recent correspondence on airlines and climate change at a time when the Treasury 
Committee is undertaking an inquiry into Environmental Taxation. The serious debate required on this subject is not 
assisted when Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is reported to have referred to Sir Nicholas Stern as an "idiot" economist 
and said that air travel is neither the cause of, nor the resolution to, climate change.
It is important that airlines play their part in reducing CO emissions. It is not proposed that aviation will fully enter 
the European Union emissions trading scheme until 2012. So they have about five years to come up with some 
positive industry initiatives in order to play their part in combating climate change. After all, unlike motorists they pay 
no tax on their fuel. So given that they will literally have a free ride for the foreseeable future, the least they should 
do is come up with meaningful proposals to further reduce CO emissions in the period till 2012.
At the recent Treasury Committee hearing, I challenged the representatives of the airlines to get together and come 
back to the Committee in six months or so with some enlightened ideas. Let us hope they rise to the challenge.

Deutsche Telekom drove fixed-line operators lower yesterday after it announced its second profits warning in six 
months, but merger talk kept European equity markets buoyant.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.3 per cent higher at 1,517.07, up 4.37 points.
D Telekom said on Sunday that fierce competition in Germany and challenging currency conditions had forced it to 
rethink its 2007 forecasts. The company said it now expected core profit for this year to come in at Euros 19bn 
rather than a previous estimate of Euros 19.7bn-Euros 20.2bn.
Citigroup downgraded the stock from "hold" to "sell", while HVB Group lowered its price target.
Deutsche Telekom shares fell 4 per cent to Euros 13.60, and dragged the rest of the fixed-line sector with it. 
Telecom Italia fell 1.5 per cent to Euros 2.27; France Telecom lost 0.9 per cent to Euros 21.18 and Swisscom shed 
1.5 per cent to SFr471.50.
Sanofi-Aventis was the worst performing stock on the CAC 40 index in Paris after a French newsletter sparked 
rumours of a merger with Bristol-Myers Squibb, of the US. Such a move would form the world's largest drug group, 
overtaking Pfizer and, while no sources were cited for the rumour, the two companies have been suggested as 
possible merger partners since they began working together on the Plavix blood thinner. Sanofi was 1.4 per cent 
lower at Euros 69 on fears such a move would dilute the shares.
Airlines rose on hopes of further consolidation in the industry. Wolfgang Mayrhuber, chief of Deutsche Lufthansa, 
which bought Swiss International Air Lines two years ago, said that if talks between the US and the European Union 
to liberalise the market failed, further European consolidation would emerge.
UBS was positive on the sector, upgrading Lufthansa and Spain's Iberia from "neutral" to "buy", and raising its price 
targets on Air France-KLM and Ryanair. "The next significant catalyst for the airline sector will be upgrades on 
lower fuel costs," said analyst Tim Marshall. Lufthansa gained 1.1 per cent to Euros 21.38, Iberia added 3.3 per 
cent to Euros 3.10, Air France gained 1.5 per cent to Euros 32.67 and Ryanair rose 1.3 per cent to Euros 11.04.

Alitalia gained 1.9 per cent to Euros 1.10 as the deadlinefor offers of interest inthe Italian airline expired.
Truckmakers were also the subject of merger talk. Fresh from its failed bid for Sweden's Scania, Germany's MAN 
was rumoured to be the target of Volvo, also of Sweden. MAN shares gained 2.6 per cent to Euros 78.86, Volvo

Body
Ever since Willie Walsh stepped personally into the protracted negotiations to avert the threatened strikes by 
thousands of British Airways cabin crew, the BA chief executive has conducted an exercise in damage limitation.
In the short term it has been about avoiding the loss of revenues - about Pounds 20m a day - that would flow from a 
protracted strike and the airline's grounding.
Just as important, theairline has sought to pre-vent damage to staff morale and to customer service relations that 
would have resulted from a prolonged conflict.
BA's reputation has taken heavy blows in recent years with chaos at its main terminals at Heathrow airport, its 
global hub, in each of the past four summers. Competition from other carriers is fierce and domestic rivals, including 
Virgin Atlantic, BMI British Midland, EasyJet and Ryanair as well as foreign airlines, had been eagerto pull 
passengers away from BA.
It could ill afford fur-ther disruption. Despiteyesterday's last-minute settlement hundreds of flights had already been 
cancelled today, as the airline took contingency measures ahead of the threatened strike. Although flights were 
reinstated, many passengers have booked with other airlines.
But Mr Walsh also had to contain the long-term damage from any strike and the inevitable concessions. He has 
been seeking to ensure the airline does not get thrown off course in its efforts to modernise, to cut costs, to reform 
outdated working practices and to reach a level of profitability that can sustain growth and allow the group to 
embark on billions of pounds of investment in new long-haul aircraft during the next decade.
In yesterday's deal there have been concessions from both sides, but the damage has been limited.
The union can justifiably claim it has stood up to what was perceived as bullying in particular over the management 
of sickness absence.
Walsh steps in to limit BA upheaval The deal with cabin crew has avoided the potential damage of a long-term 
conflict, writes Kevin Done
BA'spolicy, which has succeeded in reducing cabin crew sickness absence from an average of 22 days a year to 
12, remains in place but will now be managed more carefully "to recognise genuine concerns of cabin crew".
The airline has agreed ailments that will not be noted as part of the crew's sickness record will include colds and flu 
resulting in blocked ears; diarrhoea and vomiting; surgery or broken limbs; as well as the first period of sickness in a 
21-month period.
It remains to be seen whether attendance records deteriorate.
The union has also made progress in narrowing damaging pay differentials. Crew are on different pay scales 
depending on whether they joined before or after 1997. The gap is now being narrowed although still far from 
closed. Hitherto post-1997 long-haul crew could earn a maximum basic pay of Pounds 15,748 a year (or Pounds 
29,304 including allowances) compared with Pounds 26,600 (Pounds 40,156 with allowances) for pre-1997 crew. 
The basic for post-1997 crew will now be raised to Pounds 18,600 in four increments, a rise of Pounds 2,852.
As part of the deal BA has, however, managed to gain a key reform: to reduce the seniority of one member of the 
cabin crew on its biggest aircraft, the 747 long-haul jets. From September one of four purser positions in the 15-
person team will be replaced by a main cabin crew member, effectively cutting the overall wage bill.
On balance it appears that a dent has been made bythe cabin crew inMr Walsh's efforts to cut costs by Pounds 
450m in the two years to March 2008 but the potential for much greater long-term damage has been avoided.
The settlement of the cabin crew dispute should clear the way for other huge reforms to be completed, most notably 
the implementation of a deal to address the Pounds 2.1bn actuarial deficit in the main BA pension scheme.
Despite appearances to the contrary in the past couple of weeks, the airline has made significant progress in labour 
relations on several fronts in the last year.
In practice, Mr Walsh has shown patience in working to gain backing from employees to the pensions reforms. The 
Transport and General Workers Union is by far the biggest at BA, however, with 20,000 members including 11,000 
cabin crew, and yesterday's settlement with the cabin staff should swing the T&G firmly into supporting the 
pensions deal.
Once in place the pensions reform should then allow the credit-rating agencies to raise BA's debt rating back to 
investment grade, smoothing the path for capital spending on new aircraft.
Mr Walsh has also won some much-needed changes in working practices ahead of the hugely important move to 
the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow next March.
Deals have already been secured with groups rang-ing from baggage handlers and loaders to aircraft dispatchers 
and ground transport services staff, with passenger services, such as check-in and sales, left as the one big group 
yet to agree a deal on new ways of working.
If a legacy of the last few weeks can also be an improved working relationship with the cabin crew, Mr Walsh's 
reputation from Ireland as a tough but fair manager could yet be enhanced.
BA could also still be on track to achieving a 10 per cent operating profit margin in the year to March 2008, a holy 
grail that has eluded all previous managements.

Ryanair is being investigated by Marseilles prosecutors after the low-cost airline failed to obtain authorisation for 
new routes between Marseilles and Morocco last November before offering tickets for sale, according to reports.
French sources said authorities have received some 40 complaints accusing the company of selling promotional 
tickets before getting the green light for the routes.
Last November, Ryanair postponed the flights after completion of an open skies agreement the European Union 
and Morocco was delayed.
 The opening of the new routes was pushed back to December and the airline said it would reimburse tickets or 
offer alternative flights. Ryanair's sales manager for France, Matthieu Glasson, denied any fraudulent activity on the 
airlines's part. He said all affected customers who had applied for a refund had been granted one.

From Mr Roger Backhouse.
Sir, Michael O'Leary (Letters, January 25) is correct to remind us that power generation and other forms of transport 
create more carbon dioxide than aviation. However, aviation is more damaging for other reasons. Apart from 
emitting nitrous oxides, jet aircraft contribute to global warming by forming high-level condensation trails. The trails 
of ice crystals are nuclei for cloud formation, creating cirriform clouds known to act as a blanket and raise ground 
temperatures.
One study has suggested that warming from aircraft-derived cirriform clouds is 10 times greater than that expected 
from aviation's CO emissions. Aircraft thus give a "double whammy" to global warming. There is a readable 
summary of the research in The Cloudspotter's Guide by Gavin Pretor-Pinney.
I have greatly enjoyed holidays by air, but after looking at the evidence I find the environmental damage too serious. 
Despite Ryanair's tempting cheap flights, I won't be flying again.

Russia's first budget airline debuts with flight to Black Sea

Body
Russia's first budget airline took to the skies Monday in a bold bid to win a sizable share of the fast-growing, US$7 
billion (€5 billion) domestic market by 2012.
Sky Express is making a modest start, leasing two Boeings 737s it has decorated with bright purple, yellow and 
blue lettering across each plane's fuselage and the silhouette of a person flying on the tail.
But the company is hoping to expand fast and win passengers who now opt for the slow but cheaper railways. It is 
offering one-way tickets from Moscow to the Black Sea and other destinations for as little as US$19 (€15). In 
comparison, on Monday flag carrier Aeroflot was offering return tickets to Sochi for around US$240 (€186).
"Unfortunately over the past 10 years it has become very difficult for most of the population to fly," said Sky Express 
Director Marina Bukalova.
Initially, the company, which is hoping to mimic the fast growth seen by European budget carriers Ryanair and 
easyJet, will fly just two flights daily to the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. The company would eventually expand its 
fleet to eight Boeings by the spring, flying to destinations in the Ural mountains, Siberia and southern Russia, airline 
spokesman Vitaly Korenyugin said.
"The market was starved of budget airlines, it was high time something like this was started up," said Richard 
Wallis, spokesman for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Russia which has so far 
contributed US$10 million (€8 million) to the company's initial US$48 million (€37 million) capitalization.
In an attempt to overcome local wariness of using credit cards to buy online, as well as low credit card ownership in 
general, Korenyugin said the company had opened a sales network that will enable customers to pay for tickets at 
56,000 locations around the country, including post office branches and state-owned bank Vneshtorgbank.
Korenyugin said the company hopes to garner a 7 percent market share by the end of the year, and control 25 
percent within five years a forecast competitors called optimistic.
Russia's first budget airline debuts with flight to Black Sea
Ilya Novkhatsky, spokesman for Russia's biggest internal carrier, S7, which controls about 15 percent of the 
domestic market, warned that the opportunities for cost-cutting on Russia's market were low.
"There is one airport, one fuel company and one catering company: the conditions for a low-cost airline in the 
European sense don't simply don't exist in Russia," he said.
But passengers checking in to the inaugural flight welcomed the low prices. "There is a risk, but I think it's great ... it 
lets you save and allows you to do other things like renting a car or going skiing one more time," said Irena 
Degtyareva.
Not everyone was pleased by the no-frills approach.

Russia's first budget airline took to the skies Monday in a bid to win a sizable share of the fast-growing, $7 billion 
domestic market by 2012.
Sky Express is making a modest start, leasing two Boeings 737s it has decorated with bright purple, yellow and 
blue lettering across each plane's fuselage and the silhouette of a person flying on the tail.
But the company is hoping to expand fast and win passengers who now opt for the slow but cheaper railways. It is 
offering one-way tickets from Moscow to the Black Sea and other destinations for as little as $19. In comparison, on 
Monday flag carrier Aeroflot was offering return tickets to Sochi for around $240.
"Unfortunately over the past 10 years it has become very difficult for most of the population to fly," said Sky Express 
Director Marina Bukalova.
Initially, the company, which is hoping to mimic the fast growth seen by European budget carriers Ryanair and 
easyJet, will fly just two flights daily to the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. The company would eventually expand its 
fleet to eight Boeings by the spring, flying to destinations in the Ural mountains, Siberia and southern Russia, airline 
spokesman Vitaly Korenyugin said.
"The market was starved of budget airlines, it was high time something like this was started up," said Richard 
Wallis, spokesman for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Russia, which has so far

Shares in Dublin closed modestly higher today, erasing some of last week's sharp falls, with AIB, Elan and Paddy 
Power leading the way.
Having fallen more than 80 points last week, the ISEQ index of Irish shares made a slight recovery today, climbing 
21.95 points higher at 9,322.38.
A positive start on Wall Street raised investor sentiment in Dublin, with US stocks boosted by merger and 
acquisition news. However, gains there were capped ahead of a busy week for economic and corporate news with 
the FOMC rate meeting on Wednesday taking centre stage.
 Back in Dublin, AIB led the way in the financial sector, up 22c to 22.25, while Irish Life and Permanent added on 1c 
to 20.91. Bank of Ireland ended the day 13c lower at 17.52, with Anglo Irish Bank unchanged on 15.96. The day's 
star performer was Elan, jumping more than 4pc, or 41c to 9.45. The pharmaceutical group is due to release its 
fourth quarter and full year 2006 financial results on February 20. Paddy Power was another notable gainer, up 30c 
to 16.90, as it continues to enjoy a run of favourable sporting results. Despite a positive start to the session, IONA 
Technologies slipped into the red on profit taking after it said last week that fourth-quarter profits tripled as it 
increased sales of its Artix product. The firm reported total revenue of USD77.8m for last year, an increase of 17pc 
compared with 2005. Net profits for the year were USD2.5m, while profits in the fourth quarter were USD2.9m. Iona 
reported a loss of nearly USD1m in 2005. Shares closed 12c lower at 4.14. CandC's was another notable faller, 
down 37c to 11.23, as its difficult start to the year continues, while FBD Holdings fell 55c to 39.80 and IAWS slipped 
3c to 18.06. Recruitment firm CPL Resources fell 39c to 6.41 on profit taking, after it announced a 75pc jump in pre-
tax profits for the first half of the year. The strong figures prompted stockbroking analysts to upgrade their current 
year earnings estimates by around 20pc. CPL revealed profit before tax of E8m for the six months to December, 
and earnings per share of 18.9 cent, up 78pc. It also said it has proposed an interim dividend of 1.75c. Elsewhere, 
ISEQ closes 21pts higher on AIB, Elan
trading in the construction sector was mixed, with Grafton up 9c to 12.04, McInerney up 10c to 15.85 and Kingspan 
down 1c to 19.39. Building materials group CRH remained unchanged at 30.75. Meanwhile, food group Greencore 
was down 8c to 4.27, while Ryanair added on 11c to 11.03 and UTV jumped 6c to 5.62. Former state airline slipped 
2c to 2.83, with ICON up 98c to 30.68. Shares in South Wharf ended the day 13c lower at 6.92 after the High Court 
sanctioned its sale to the Becbay consortium. South Wharf investors will now receive their money within 14 days. 
South Wharf shareholders last year voted to sell the company to Becbay which comprises developers Bernard 
McNamara and Derek Quinlan and Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) for E412 million.

UK AND IRELAND: Republic's olive branch to the North REPUBLIC OF IRELAND & NORTHERN IRELAND

A poster on the construction site for Dublin's recently- completed port tunnel used to boast that the projectwas 
"totally funded by the Irish taxpayer".
It might seem a curious claim. After all, the Republic of Ireland is one of the strongest performing economies in 
Europe. But it is a reminder that until this year almost all public infrastructure in Ireland was in part paid for by 
Brussels. In effect the taxpayers of Germany and France and other rich member states funded Ireland's roads and 
civic buildings.
Not any more. Ireland will from 2007 be a net contributor to the EU budget - proof of its extraordinary economic 
advance and a reflection of the accession of new member states from central Europe, which in the main are poorer 
than Ireland was when it joined in the 1970s.
This might have been the moment for the Irish economy to start slowing down. But the government signalled last 
week plans to ratchet up public investment, with commitments to spend Euros 184bn (Pounds 121bn) over the next 
seven years.
The plan is aimed at easing bottlenecks in the economy - the number in work has jumped by almost 1m from 1.1m 
in 1990 to just over 2m last year.
Ireland, this time, will be providing the vast bulk of funding for what it calls the national development plan.
Rossa White, economist at Davy, the stockbroking firm, says: "Irish public finances are in great shape. This means 
there is lots ofroom for the government to borrow to finance capital spending, even if tax revenue growth slows."
In a bold departure, an unspecified chunk of the money is to be used to fund projects in Northern Ireland. Bertie 
Ahern, the prime minister, says there is "no reason why the Celtic Tiger cannot be an all-island phenomenon". Irish 
officials are reluctant to say much about the plan while negotiations continue between political parties to try to 
reinstate the power-sharing executive and legislative assembly.
UK AND IRELAND: Republic's olive branch to the North REPUBLIC OF IRELAND & NORTHERN IRELAND
But it is not totally unprecedented. The Dublin government is already helping fund the extension of Derry airport in 
County Londonderry. Ryanair, the low-cost Dublin-based airline, insisted on lengthening the strip to facilitate its new 
fleet of aircraft. Dublin is also paying for the upgrade of the cross-border road from Newry to Dundalk.
The so-called north-west corridor, linking County Londonderry in Northern Ireland with County Donegal in the 
Republic, is talked about as a likely project. Cross-border rail links are also earmarked.
Although the creation of an all-Ireland energy market, allowing companies to buy and sell energy across the border, 
has been delayed, the national development plan is likely to be used to fund gas and electricity interconnectors 
between the two regions.
Indeed, energy companies could be among the other major beneficiaries of the plan. Viridian, the former Northern 
Ireland electricity supplier which was last month taken private by a Bahraini investment fund called Arcapita Bank, 
has power stations north and south, as does the Electricity Supply Board, the Republic's state-owned power utility.
It is harder to see the beneficiaries of this largesse among Ireland's listed companies. Goodbody, the broking 
subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, has a buy recommendation on CRH, Grafton, Kingspan and McInerney. Merrion 
Capital, another broker, cited the same four companies and added Ready-mix and Qual-ceram-Shires.
But CRH, although a major supplier of cement and aggregates in the Irish market, relies on domestic sales for less 
than 10 per cent of its worldwide revenues. And Grafton's building materials business is more focused on 
housebuilding and DIY than on civilworks, although it has a contracting division.
Merrill Lynch, the US bank, initiated coverage of housebuilder McInerney Holdings last week but did not mention 
the national development plan. McInerney, it said, was attractive because it was "the only direct way to play the still 
strong Irish housing sector, but without exposure to an increasingly overheated Dublin market".
Perhaps the real significance of the national development plan is its commitment to spending money in Northern 
Ireland, in what is a foreign jurisdiction.
Until now, talk of Irish funding for projects in Northern Ireland might have been interpreted by -pro-British unionist 
politicians as meddling.
But it is notable that while local parties gave a fairly sceptical reception to the economic package that was 
announced back in November by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, they seem to have been much more welcoming of 
what the Irish government was offering.
Perhaps they recognise that the Republic's coffers are not going to be overflowing for ever.

The challenge of dragging its workforce kicking and screaming into the 21st century is not only faced by British 
Airways. All the European flag carriers are grappling with the same task. Planned industrial action by BA's cabin 
crew next week, though, looks like a big step backwards.
The proposed strikes would be the first official action for a decade and every day lost could cost BA Pounds 20m in 
traffic revenues. The topline hit will make it yet more difficult for Willie Walsh, chief executive, to reach his 10 per 
cent operating margin goal. He will not feel too discouraged, though.
BA's cabin crew, nearly a third of its 44,000 workforce, mainly seems upset about attempts to reduce sick leave to a 
target of nine days a year. Even the target is well above the UK average of seven - one indication of how far BA has 
to go before it matches competitive industry norms. After five years of restructuring, its average costs per employee, 
25 per cent above those of Ryanair and Easyjet, remain among the highest.
The cabin crew's focus on a relatively minor issue suggests Mr Walsh may be making progress. The dispute does 
not seem to centre on his most pressing priorities - tackling the pension deficit and changing working practices to 
ensure a successful move to London Heathrow's Terminal 5. Two-thirds of BA's workforce have apparently already 
agreed to these changes, which augurs well.
The willingness of BA's shareholders to weather shocks - from fog to security scares to walk-outs - has often been 
tested. The shares have risen more than 64 per cent over the past 12 months. At about 12 times 2007 consensus 
earnings, they are valued bang on their long-term average. While painful for passengers, eight days of strikes may 
prove less excruciating for investors.

The Dublin market slumped more than 70 points today on the back of sharp falls in AIB, CandC and Elan.
Having traded in the black for much of the day, shares plummeted late in the session as the weaker tone to Wall 
Street prompted investors pull back.
US stocks fell moderately as strong profit reports from several big technology names failed to sustain investor 
enthusiasm for the sector a day after tech issues posted sharp gains.
 In Dublin, the ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 70.32 points lower at 9,365.17. Having recorded sharp gains on 
Wednesday, shares in AIB fell back today, down 34c to 22.30. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Bank of Ireland 
slipped 20c to 17.8o, while Irish Life and Permanent lost 6c to 21.12. Anglo Irish Bank managed to buck the trend, 
closing 11c higher at 16.20. The sluggish performance amongst the banks was echoed by Elan and CandC, down 
3pc, or 31c, to 9.18 and 2pc, or 25c, to 11.50 respectively. McInerney was the star performer in the construction 
sector, climbing 15c to 15.95 after it issued a strong trading update earlier in the week. The release showed a 
strong performance in the UK, with the house builder forecasting another good year in 2007. Shares in the 
company have enjoyed an impressive recent run, which has prompted Goodbody to move its recommendation on 
the stock from Buy to Add. Analyst Peter Gunn said "In the long term, we remain convinced of McInerney's 
business model, albeit while facing into a tougher trading environment in its home market in 2007 and 2008". 
Elsewhere, CRH tacked on 1c to 30.86, while Grafton added on 2c to 12.25. Kingspan ended the session 26c lower 
at 19.63. Aer Lingus was a notable faller, down 6c to 2.84, ahead of today's talks between management and unions 
at the Labour Relations Commission aimed at resolving a dispute of proposed changes in working practices at the 
airline. Unions at the airline are balloting their members for industrial action which could result in a strike as early as 
the start of next month. Both SIPTU and Impact, which represent a range of Aer Lingus employees including pilots, 
cabin crew and general staff, are objecting to proposed changes in working practices, such as holiday and overtime

pay and grading structures. Meanwhile, Ryanair, which this week said it has no intention of selling its 25pc stake in 
Aer Lingus, ended the day unchanged on 10.90. Shares in outsourcing group Newcourt soared over 5pc today, up 
9c to 1.78. The jump came after recruitment firm CPL Resources announced a 75pc increase in pre-tax profits for 
the six months to December last. These results were seen as an encouraging sign for Newcourt's Sigmar 
recruitment arm. "Sigmar is mainly based in the Irish Labour market, where CPL is positioned, and accounts for 
roughly a fifth of group revenues," Goodbody analyst Phillip O'Sullivan said. "With CPL achieving an improvement 
across all of its business areas, the read-through from this for Sigmar is positive." Newcourt is expected to unveil its 
full year results for 2006 in March. Other notable movers included Providence, up 5c to 0.08, South Wharf, up 15c 
to 7.05, and Donegal Creameries, up 10c to 6.30.

Lawrence Hunt says he received the usual phone call from his great-aunt Christina Foyle, when he finished school. 
She wanted to know when he would be joining the family business, the famous Foyles bookshop in London's 
Charing Cross Road.
"I went to lunch with her, that was the standard thing. It was a very short conversation. In her last few years the 
business was in decline. She did not pay any one over Pounds 15,000 and there were no pay rises. It was slave 
labour," he says.
Two decades later, Mr Hunt is starting his own airline, Silverjet, after working as a sales agent for IBM, switching to 
a small software company, getting invol-ved in three technology start-ups and moving into the travel business.
The first UK all-business class, long-haul carrier is due to be launched today on its initial route between London 
Luton and New York Newark airports.
The aviation industry is littered with broken dreams, failed business plans and squandered fortunes. But there is 
never a shortage of new candidates waiting at the end of the runway for clearance to become the next Branson or 
Stelios. Airlines are notorious for destroying rather than creating capital, but for the right initiative there can be great 
rewards.
For much of the past decade the success stories of the industry have tended to come from the short-haul, low-cost 
sector - Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe, Air Asia and Virgin Blue in the Asia-Pacific region and Jet-Blue and Gol in 
the Americas. But in the past couple of years the business plans chasing funding have taken on a different hue, 
with the arrival of long-haul, all-business class carriers.
A sky full of silver linings Setting up the first UK all-business-class airline required patience, contacts and the 
nerve to do things differently, Lawrence Hun....
Just over a year ago Eos Airlines and Maxjet, both US start-ups, began flying in the London/New York market 
between London Stansted and New York's JFK airports. A few weeks ago they were followed by L'Avion, the trade 
name of Elysair, a French all-business-class carrier operating between Paris Orly and New York's Newark airports.
Striding between the unromantic arrivals cafe of Luton airport and the shiny entrance of Silverjet's private terminal, 
Mr Hunt reveals an uncharacteristic touch of nerves beneath his normal casual self-confidence. "This is not the best 
time to be giving up smoking again," he admits.
Mr Hunt realised his next venture should be an all-business class airline thanks to his experiences of flying long-
haul in economy, often to California with his technology start-ups.
"When you are starting a business you cannot afford to travel business class. I always wondered, 'Why does it cost 
10 times the price of economy to fly business class?' "
He sold his last business, Rapid Travel Solutions, a technology provider to travel groups, for Pounds 10m in 2001 to 
Telewest Communications, and left the company in 2003.
In early 2004 he started talks with his cousin Christopher Foyle, now chairman of Foyles bookshop but more 
importantly a veteran of the UK aviation sector with his own business Air Foyle Heavylift, the air freight group, and 
previously a provider of aircraft, crew and licences for passenger airline start-ups, including EasyJet.
For six months they discussed routes, seat densities, cabin configurations, aircraft types, yield management and 
marketing until the business plan was honed. "There is no magic, no silver bullet in starting a business," says Mr 
Hunt. "You must above all have absolute persistence and determination . . . and be prepared to do everything 
differently." His skills, he says, are in building businesses, in financing and putting a team together.
He began to assemble a team of experienced airline and travel industry executives: "I needed people who are 
passionate about what they do. I wanted airline people, who knew how to do it."
His recruits included managing director Peter Evans, a former head of operations of both Virgin Atlantic and 
MyTravel Airways. "He gets his kicks from on-time performance," Mr Hunt says.
Martyn Bridger came on board as customer experience director. He spent 24 years at British Airways, finally as 
head of inflight service, and since 2000 has been a consultant to several big carriers.
For the management team, Mr Hunt preferred people who had run their ownbusinesses and were well-versed in 
building businessprocesses.
For cabin staff, any applicant with more than 18 months airline experience as cabin crew did not stand a chance. 
"We were looking for people who can smile, who would be happier when the aircraft is full than when it is empty. I 
was talking on a BA plane to a stewardess, who said the flight was a nightmare. Why? Because the plane was full."
He says product differentiation is vital in starting a business and you must know your route to the market. The most 
difficult issue in getting Silverjet off the ground, however, was securing financial backing. "I ap-proached more than 
900 potential investors, private equity groups and wealthy individuals. I probably saw about 150 and must have 
visited 10 countries." Three times, he says, deals fell through at the 11th hour.
"We fell out because they wanted too much (equity). And also over the interference rights. They started changing 
the business plan - the spreadsheet jockeys from private equity firms, MBAs aged around 30, who haven't done 
anything but sit in front of their spreadsheets and screens," he says.
Around the end of 2005, he was introduced by his finance director to Arden Partners, stockbroker and corporate 
finance advis-er for small and mid-cap companies. "After seven hours in the pub with them we hatched a plan to 
float."
A sky full of silver linings Setting up the first UK all-business-class airline required patience, contacts and the 
nerve to do things differently, Lawrence Hun....
He says that the listing process and flotation was much easier than approaching private equity. "We could 
concentrate on the float, and marketing to public investors was a much more sophisticated process. The broker 
makes sure your business is going to work. We saw 37 investors and 31 came on board."
Last May the still paper airline raised Pounds 25.3m in a share placement and listed on Aim, the junior market of 
the London Stock Exchange. Silverjet had a market capitalisation of Pounds 33.6m with 18.7 per cent of the equity

Back at Luton airport Silverjet's elegant private terminal is sandwiched bet-ween the giant orange hangar soon to 
be occupied by EasyJet's headquarters and the redbrick of the original airport building amid utilitarian ads for the

Next door, however, is the airport chapel, handy for any moments of doubt and reflection Mr Hunt may have on the 
challenges he faces in the whirl of starting his own airline.

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, It is clear from his letter (January 23) that Ian Pearson, the UK minister for climate change and the environment, 
still hasn't a clue what he is talking about.
He claims that bringing aviation into a European Union emissions trading scheme will give airlines the incentive to 
minimise their emissions by upgrading their aircraft or using them more efficiently. This of course is nonsense.
Oil is and will remain a far more potent incentive to European airlines to minimise their emissions and upgrade their 
aircraft, a process that is being led by low-fare airlines such as Ryanair which are now the cleanest, greenest 
airlines in Europe.
Bringing airlines into the European emissions trading scheme would simply increase the cost of air travel, on top of 
"Greedy Gordon" Brown's most recent doubling of UK air passenger duty from Pounds 5 to Pounds 10 per ticket.
As the Stern report recently confirmed, aviation accounts for less than 2 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Europe's Environmental Agency confirms that aviation generates fewer CO emissions than marine transport. Why 
don't Mr Pearson and "Greedy Gordon" start taxing ferries and cruise ships instead of airlines?
Better still, why don't they do something about power generation, which accounts for 26 per cent of CO emissions, 
or road transport (18 per cent) ? Tackling these two biggest offenders will do far more to reduce emissions and 
climate change than penalising air transport further, which is neither the cause of nor the solution to climate change.

Chief Executive,

Inquiry criticises Brown for rise in air duty
Inquiry criticises Brown for rise in air duty

Body
Gordon Brown has been attacked by a Labour-dominated Commons inquiry for rushing in a doubling of air 
passenger duty ahead of the spring Budget.
In an unusually critical assessment of the 2006 pre-Budget report, the Commons Treasury committee took issue 
with the chancellor's decision to raise the tax on all departing airline passengers from February 1, before parliament 
had the chance to consider it.
In their report, the MPs raised doubts about the Treasury's assumption of a higher trend rate of growth of 2.75 per 
cent, saying it was based on migration -statistics of "questionable quality".
They also urged a full-scale review of the chancellor's fiscal rules, rebuked him for failing to explain his 
announcement on capital spending in education and demanded better information on the success of the 
government's Whitehall efficiency drive.
The doubling of APD from Thursday has angered the airlines because they may be forced to absorb the cost if they 
are unable to recoverit from passengers whohave already bought their tickets.
EasyJet and Ryanair have been trying to contact hundreds of thousands of passengers. British Airways has said it 
will pay the bill itself, expected to be Pounds 11m.
The airlines are incensed that the proceeds from a supposed green tax are not being used to offset other taxes or 
directly benefit the environment. Ryanair yesterday took out full-page advertisements in several newspapers 
depicting Mr Brown as a tourist-robbing outlaw.
The committee acknowledged that it was "often appropriate" for tax changes to have immediate effect if they carried 
a "significant risk of forestalling activity or could distort market behaviour", even if formal parliamentary approval 
could not be obtained for some weeks.
Inquiry criticises Brown for rise in air duty
But on this occasion, the committee had "received no evidence to suggest such considerations apply". The MPs 
suggested the lack of prior consultation on such tax changes brought into question the very purpose of the pre-
Budget report.
The Treasury will gain Pounds 165m by raising APB two months before the end of the financial year.

Hopes that air fares could fall were dashed after the EU Commission opted not to regulate the amounts major 
airports can charge for landings.
Ryanair fear the move will in fact reduce competition between some of the busiest airlines in Europe.
The Association of European Airlines that represents Europe's three biggest carriers - Air France-KLM, Deutsche 
Lufthansa and British Airways - wanted a limit on the amount of money airports could charge for landing.
 They were disappointed this did not happen but overall welcomed the changes. Transport Commissioner Jacques 
Barrot announced that airports with more than a million passengers a year would have to publish their rates while 
each country will have to appoint a national regulator to settle any disputes. It will apply to about 100 airports in 
Europe including Dublin, Cork and Shannon.

EU calls on airports to justify fees they charge airlines

Body
The European Union called on airport operators Wednesday to justify the fees they charge to airlines using their 
services in a new bid to increase competition and reduce ticket prices for consumers.
Air carriers have complained that as the number of flights takes off, airports are sometimes charging excessive fees 
to airlines for managing take-off, landing and baggage handling.
EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot presented new proposals which would force airports to adhere to 
common EU-wide standards how they set their charges, but fell short of setting a cap on the charges to airlines.
"The way in which these fees are set has to be transparent," Barrot said. "This is designed specifically to moderate 
the fees of large airports because there is a larger level of demand and they might want to abuse the system and 
put up their fees ... This is designed to combat that."
Under Barrot's plan each EU government will have to put in place an independent regulator to arbitrate fees levied 
on airlines by airports.
Each airport currently negotiates its own charges with airlines. The EU wants them to explain how they calculate 
their fees and give airlines the right to complain to a regulator if they are unhappy.
It also wants airports to be more open about what it plans to spend on new infrastructure or security screening 
facilities since these can push up the fees.
And it said that airports used by low-cost carriers such as Ryanair PLC should be allowed to charge less for 
reduced services as long as these were open to all carriers.
Airport charges account for between 4 percent and 8 percent of carriers' costs but they are rising steeply as airlines 
slim down what they pay to run aircraft, ticket sales and back-office operations and cut fares by nearly a third over 
the last decade amid fierce competition.
"The cost per passenger rose 13 percent between 2001 and 2004," the International Air Transport Association said.
EU calls on airports to justify fees they charge airlines
Fifteen of the world's 25 most expensive airports are in Europe, it said, claiming that prices have increased sharply 
in Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Munich in recent years.
The Association of European Airlines said it was high time all EU nations put rules in place that force airports to 
negotiate fees fairly with airlines.
"Airlines compete for passengers, but cannot choose the airports they wish to fly to," said AEA Secretary General 
Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus. "Although many airports have begun treating airlines as customers and no longer as 
users, they are still natural monopolies."
However, airports will have to expand rapidly if traffic keeps up with current trends and doubles within 20 years.
"If current capacity levels are not drastically increased, it is estimated that over 60 European airports will be heavily 
congested and the top 20 airports will be saturated at least 8-10 hours per day by 2025," the Commission said.
Since it takes between five and 10 years for airports to add capacity, the EU executive said it was urging more 
efficient use of existing facilities. It also called for better rail links to less popular airports to ease the pressure on 
main city hubs.
Air traffic in Europe tripled between 1980 and 2000 with flights within the EU increasing by 150 percent from 1992 
and 2005, the EU said.

Following three days of consecutive falls, the Dublin market soared more than 100 points today, with financial 
shares leading the charge.
Bank of Ireland was the star performer, climbing over 2pc, or 50c to 18.00, while shares in AIB jumped 26c to

The strong performance in the sector, helped the ISEQ index of Irish shares 124.84 points higher to 9,435.49.
 Elan closed almost 4pc higher after its recent miserable run. Shares have fallen in recent times as investors 
eagerly await an update on the performance of its Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri. Elan is due to issue its full year 
figures on February 20, while its Elan partner, Biogen, will release its update on February 15. Shares ended the day 
33c higher at 9.49. The positivity in other sectors failed to lift C and C, which continues to endure a miserable start 
to the year. Shares in the Bulmers owner fell 15c to 11.75 today. Trading in the construction sector was mainly 
positive, with CRH up 45c to 30.85, Grafton up 13c to 12.23 and Kingspan up 24c to 19.89. The sector was buoyed 
by the publication of the Government's National Development Plan in which it revealed plans to spend over E21 
billion on housing and E54.7 billion on national infrastructure. Shares in McInerney fell on profit taking after it 
released a positive trading statement earlier this week. Shares in the firm have climbed more 28pc since the end of 
November. The house builder was also hit by a downgrade from Dolmen, who said a slowdown in Irish 
homebuilding was now evident. Shares ended the day 12c lower at 15.80. Ryanair was again in the headlines, 
lifting its share price 12c higher to 10.90. The no frills airline said today that it is to start five new routes from Dublin, 
with another nine to follow between now and May. It also said it has no plans to sell its stake in Aer Lingus despite 
its failed bid for the former state airline. The airline said it does not believe that the EU can force it to sell its minority 
holding. Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, added that the increase in air passenger duty on airplane tickets is 
unlikely to hit Ryanair's passenger numbers. Elsewhere, trading was largely positive, with Kerry Group up 11c to 
19.75, ICON up 80c to 30.50 and DCC up 119c to 24.80. Sentiment in Dublin was boosted by sharp gains in

drinks firm has been hit particularly hard by a recent downgrade by Merrion Stockbrokers.
 Kingspan was the biggest faller in the construction sector, down 20c to 19.65, while Grafton was down 9c to 12.10. 
CRH was also in negative territory, down 1c to 30.39. McInerney closed unchanged on 15.92 after it issued a

analyst Peter Gunn said he McInerney is 'well positioned to enjoy another strong year in 2007, as an increased 
footprint in the recovering UK market should help to offset slowing activity levels in Ireland'. In the financial sector, 
Irish Life and Permanent was the biggest faller, down 10c to 21.10, while AIB fell 2c to 22.32. Bank of Ireland and 
Anglo Irish Bank managed slight gains, up 5c to 17.37 and 1c to 15.71 respectively. Scaffolding and fencing firm 
Siteserv closed 1c lower at 1.25 after it reported pre-tax profits of E2.6m for the six months to the end of October on 
Monday - its first results since floating in October last year. Back in Dublin, shares in Ryanair were up 5c to 10.78 
despite reports that EU could force the no-frills airline to sell its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus if it decides against its 
lapsed bid. The EU will decide by May 11 whether to prohibit such a deal on competition grounds. Shares in Aer 
Lingus were unchanged on the news at 2.95. Elsewhere, Dragon Oil fell 6c to 2.85 on profit taking following its 
ISEQ in the red for 3rd consecutive day

up 1c to 4.39, Kerry Group, down 12c to 19.58 and Paddy Power, up 49c to 16.92. Irish Continental Group was up 
4c to 15.94 after it agreed to buy a passenger cruise ferry from a Norwegian company for E45m. The ship will 
replace the line's ageing Normandy vessel on routes between Rosslare and the French ports of Cherbourg and 
Roscoff. The Irish group's subsidiary Irish Ferries expects to take delivery of the Kronprins Harald from Color Line 
vessel in October of this year. The Dublin market traded in negative territory all day, however, falls were limited by a 
strong start on Wall Street where some healthy corporate earnings news helped to lift sentiment. Investors also 
were encouraged that an interest rate cut might still be on the table after a Richmond Fed Survey showed a slip in 
its manufacturing index this month. Meanwhile, the Conference Board said US economic activity is set to accelerate 
slightly in the coming months.

Body
United Airlines has cut the expiry date on unused frequent-flyer miles to 18 months in a move which highlights the 
US industry's renewed focus on revenue growth after years of cost cutting.
The decision to halve the time limit applies only to inactive accounts, but will trim millions of dollars of liabilities from 
its balance sheet and provide more incentives for its best business customers at a time when United is looking to 
cement the revenue premium it enjoys over rivals by investing in extra services.
United's Mileage Plus scheme is the world's second-largest frequent-flyer programme after American's Advantage.
Almost 500bn miles have been accrued by flyers at United, which carries a Dollars 3.5bn deferred revenue liability 
on its balance sheet to cover future free flights and upgrades by Mileage Plus members.
The airline declined to quantify the potential impact on revenues and its balance sheet, but noted in regulatory 
filings that a 1 per cent change in the level of outstanding miles could trim the revenue liability by Dollars 41m.
United reports its full-year results today, and analysts are expected to question executives about any potential to 
sell Mileage Plus, a strategy already followed by Air Canada and considered by other US carriers.
Frequent-flyer programmes remain one of the most powerful marketing tools for the network airlines to compete 
with low-cost rivals, though carriers such as Southwest and AirTran have their own bonus schemes, in contrast to 
peers such as Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe.
Delta recently announced it would cut the expiry date on inactive accounts from three years to two, while American 
retains a three-year window and Continental and Northwest have no cut-off dates.
United said its best customers would face less competition to redeem miles on flights as dormant accounts expired, 
boosting its efforts to attract higher-paying business customers at a time when all of the US carriers have renewed 
their focus on maximising revenues.

While some carriers have yet to report fourth-quarter data, the industry is expected to report its first full-year profit 
since 2000 after five years of relentless cost-cutting, helped by a series of fare hikes over the past 18 months.
Revenue growth eased in the final quarter of 2006, in part due to tougher comparisons, but executives have 
highlighted a series of initiatives to boost non-ticket sales to regain momentum.
Southwest, the sector's most-profitable carrier, plans to sell more travel-related services such as hotel rooms, while 
American has turned its maintenance base from a cost into a profit centre after new labour agreements.

Is this the Big One? A drop of less than 2 per cent in British Airways' shares looked rather modest given the 
advancing labour relations storm. For different reasons, rival airlines, from Ryanair to Lufthansa, experienced more 
turbulence yesterday.
Perhaps that is because shareholders think of BA as a perennial focus for industrial action, even though the last 
official strike was in 1997. Perhaps the City believes Willie Walsh, chief executive, has what it takes to face down 
the unions. Certainly, the share price movement was trivial compared with the punishment investors will mete out to 
BA if Mr Walsh caves in to the Transport and General Workers Union.
The cabin crew's proposed strike action comes at the head of a series of other challenges, from reform of the 
pension scheme to rewriting working practices at Heathrow. Their solution depends on a successful conclusion to 
this dispute.
So, yes, this is the Big One. Yet "victory" for an aggressive BA management - while it might in the short term be 
welcomed by the markets - would be Pyrrhic indeed if it made agreement in the other areas impossible to achieve. 
On the other hand, a deal that favoured the unions would set a precedent for flexibility that would make a tougher 
line on, say, Terminal Five almost impossible to hold. No wonder the shares are now in a holding pattern.

Low-cost airline Ryanair PLC has launched a campaign offering 1 m free flights to passengers who write to UK

C and C weighed heavy on the Dublin market today as it continues to suffer a hangover from a recent downgrade.
Just after 14.00, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 24.76 points to 9,357.66.
Shares in C and C slumped dramatically earlier this month after Merrion Stockbrokers, which has traditionally been 
a cheerleader for the Bulmers manufacturer, cut its recommendation on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. It also lowered 
profit expectations based on evidence that people in the UK are drinking less of the company's British cider brand 
Magners in the winter months than had been previously thought. The broker said that it had surveyed a number of 
pubs in London and Birmingham. The research found a greater degree of Magners 'seasonality' than it had 
expected. Shares slipped more than 1pc or 12c to 12.23 today.
 The falls in C and C outweighed modest gains in Siteserv, which today posted pre-tax profits that rose from 
E393,000 in 2005 to E2.55m last year. Shares in the recently floated scaffolding and fencing firm jumped 6c to 1.26 
on the news. McInerney also found favour with investors after it today described 2006 as a milestone year for the 
group in a trading statement. The firm said it completed 2,372 homes in 2006, an 18pc increase on 2005 as 
completions in the UK jumped. House completions in its Irish division fell slightly to 1,025, but the figure for the UK

Ryanair and C and C dragged the Dublin market lower today, outweighing more sharp gains in Dragon Oil after it 
last week issued a positive trading update.
The near 7pc gain in shares in Dragon Oil failed to inspire the ISEQ index of Irish shares, with the market closing 
49.56 points to 9,332.86.
Shares in the oil exploration and production company have now soared by more than 16pc over the past month. 
Shares were up 19c to 2.91 in Dublin.
 Investor sentiment was hit in late afternoon trade by heavy losses on Wall Street with a downgrade on Boeing and 
concerns over a recovering oil price weighing heavy. The U.S. stock market balked at rising crude oil prices and a 
report from the Chicago region's Federal Reserve indicating above-trend growth in December for the first time in 
four months. Oil is still down about 15pc on the year, but if fuel costs rebound, consumer spending could be 
crimped. The economy could be hurt even more if U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers believe the economy is 
growing steadily enough to withstand an interest rate hike. The market is in a tug of war right now over whether 
interest rates will be raised or lowered later in the year. Back in Dublin, Ryanair was one of the biggest fallers, down 
37c to 10.73, after the European Commission confirmed on Friday that it is to question the British Government 
about the financial relationship between Ryanair and the publicly-owned City of Derry airport. The enquiry comes 
after the airport revealed in December that it handed over at least E1.9m of public money to Ryanair during a five-
year deal. C and C closed in the red as it continues to suffer a hangover from a recent broker downgrade. Shares in

Body
On no-frills airline Jetstar, you won't get pretzels, pillows or hot towels. But you might get a cheap ticket and for an 
extra $5, you can have a delicious plate of coconut sticky rice served in a banana leaf.
Singapore-based Jetstar Asia Airways Pte. Ltd. is one of dozens of new low-cost airlines transforming Asia's travel 
landscape. Copying the model set by European discounters like Ryanair Ltd., more than 30 budget airlines have 
launched in Asia since 2002. By stripping out perks and relentlessly cutting costs, these airlines offer one-way 
tickets for as little as $15 including taxes. They now serve growing tourism hubs in Asia, including Siem Reap, 
Cambodia; Shenzhen, China; and Goa, India.
While most of these carriers focus on short hops of three hours or less, some of the newest, such as Oasis Hong 
Kong Airlines Ltd., are offering long-haul routes like Hong Kong to London at fares starting at $230, including taxes 
and fees. Oasis plans to start flights to Chicago and Oakland, Calif., later this year.
Asia's discount-airline boom is changing the way many Americans visit the region, making it cheaper to visit 
multiple destinations in a single trip. The simplest way for U.S. travelers to make use of these airlines is to buy a 
round-trip ticket to a major Asian city well-served by discounters, such as Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, or 
Delhi, and then book side trips on budget carriers.
The discounters have opened up access to dozens of new tourism sites such as Kuching, Malaysia (where you can 
trek through Borneo's tropical rain forests), and the quiet island of Ban Ko Jum, Thailand (where you can drink 
pineapple shakes on deserted beaches).
Since most of the discounters fly new aircraft, they generally have good, if short, safety records. (The 
disappearance of an Adam Air flight in bad weather in Indonesia nearly three weeks ago raised some concerns 
about safety in a rapidly growing industry; that plane was 17 years old.)
But what is it actually like to travel on Asia's flying buses? To find out, we took a jaunt through Southeast Asia, 
starting in Hong Kong, and made a loop through Bangkok, Phuket, Singapore and back to Hong Kong, testing four 
discounters. We also took a $266 flight from London to Hong Kong on Oasis, the new long-haul carrier.
Flying in Asia on the cheap
All five flights were on time, nobody lost our luggage, and service was generally upbeat and friendly although we did 
overhear one AirAsia flight attendant tell a British passenger whose seat belt didn't fit that he should lose weight.
It wasn't all smooth flying. We nearly missed a weekend in Bangkok because Orient Thai Airlines Co. Ltd. sold us a 
one-way ticket to Thailand, neglecting to mention that Thai immigration authorities wouldn't let us into the country 
without a return ticket. Tiger Airways' plane had threadbare rugs and an unsettling Sani-Flush smell wafting through 
the cabin. And while our general Oasis experience was excellent the plane had personalized TV screens with 14 
free video channels don't get us started on the slimy red gelatin concoction served for dessert on that flight. (The 
airline says it has improved its meal service on the London-Hong Kong route.)
Booking can be a hassle, since Asia's budget carriers don't show up on fare-consolidation sites like Expedia, and 
phone booking often requires calling overseas. The easiest way for Americans to book is to buy tickets directly from 
the individual carrier's Web site. Getting the cheapest fares often requires booking months ahead.
Some of these airlines fly into budget terminals or secondary airports that can complicate matters if you need to 
make connections. And like their U.S. and European counterparts, Asia's budget airlines typically charge extra for 
food, entertainment and baggage exceeding about 44 pounds.
We had one of our best experiences on Jetstar, which has hubs in Singapore and Australia. The fun began before 
the plane took off from Singapore for Hong Kong. While many discount carriers fly out of bare-bones terminals, 
Jetstar flies out of the main terminal of Singapore's luxurious Changi Airport, where you can hang out in a Jacuzzi, 
get a foot reflexology massage or visit the free movie theater as you wait for your flight. Jetstar's pristine plane had 
cushy leather seats, and for $8 you could rent a digital entertainment console.
On board Oasis, which we flew from London's Gatwick Airport to Hong Kong, you'd never know you weren't on a 
full-fare carrier. Oasis purchases its planes from Singapore Airlines, which is known for its luxurious aircraft. The 
stylish purple seats had adequate legroom and individual LCD screens. Options on the 14 free video channels 
ranged from "Ocean's 12" to "Initial D" a Japanese film about a nerdy tofu delivery man-turned-celebrity race-car 
driver. Meals were included.
We were less pleased with our trip on Orient Thai, primarily a charter airline that offers some discount seats to 
travelers on international flights between destinations such as Bangkok and Hong Kong.
Orient Thai didn't offer phone or Internet booking, so we wound up buying a ticket at the Hong Kong airport a few 
minutes before our flight left. The ticketing desk sold us a one-way ticket to Bangkok. Just minutes later, the check-
in staff refused to let us board, saying that Thai immigration required passengers to have a ticket out of Thailand in 
order to enter the country. We raced back to the ticket desk and purchased a second-leg ticket. In the end, we 
barely made the flight. We paid $255 for our one-way ticket, which wasn't much cheaper than the full-fare carriers.
Orient Thai Chief Executive Udom Tantiprasongchai said tickets on that route normally sell for as little as $96, and 
said it was "good to know" about our unpleasant experience, because the company outsources ticketing and check-
in in Hong Kong to another firm.
Our brief flight from Bangkok to Phuket on Malaysia's AirAsia was efficient and uneventful. AirAsia is the largest 
discounter in Asia, with 72 routes and 49 aircraft. The plane had nice leather seats, and the menu included items 
like crabstick sandwiches. The only hitch: Online booking closed 24 hours before the flight took off, so we had to 
buy our ticket at the airport.
Singapore's Tiger Airways, which offers 16 routes in seven countries, including Australia, Thailand and China, was 
on-time and friendly, but the plane's cabin was in ratty condition, with worn rugs and seats. The airline says all of its 
planes are less than three years old, and it recently switched to a higher grade of carpet.

Body
Dolmen Stockbrokers has forecast another strong year for Irish equities in 2007 despite fears over increased 
borrowing and the strength of the dollar.
In its 2007 strategic review, the broker said the outlook is good with strong economics forecasts, a resilient property 
market and the ISEQ index of Irish shares at an all time high.
However, it has warned that personal borrowing now exceeds mortgage borrowing, and claims that "borrowing has 
now become a habit" with banks lining up to give us money.
 It also cautions that foreign investment, particularly that from the US, continues to be of central importance to the 
Irish economy. It has highlighted AIB, CRH, Independent News and Media, Greencore and Ryanair as its preferred 
stocks for the year ahead. Dolmen believes that the biggest threat to the Irish economy remains the weakness of 
the dollar against the euro. In recent months, several leading US multinationals have announced staffing reviews in 
their Irish operations. This has coincided with the 2007 Budget and the euro rising to USD1.32 against the dollar. 
"The satellite towns built on the Intels, Pfizers, Dells and Microsofts may yet be threatened if the euro/dollar rate hits 
USD1.40 in due course, as some market analysts believe it may," Dolmen said. "Equally the move by some 
countries to consider minimum taxation levels if applied to companies at rates of 15pc, would threaten Ireland's 
competitive position. We are a resourceful economy but we may well need to be."

Southwest Airlines, the largest US domestic carrier, has ruled out luring passengers with in-flight gambling, but 
pledged to introduce alternative new products to counter slowing revenue growth.
The Dallas-based carrier, which yesterday reportedits 34th consecutive year of profitability, provided the template 
for the global explosion in low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet which are now pioneering efforts to 
introduce onboard gaming and mobile phone calls.
Gary Kelly, Southwest's chief executive, identified travel-related services such as hotel booking as likely revenue-
generating areas.
Southwest's "no-frills" model eschews products such as meals and lounges which rivals have used to boost 
revenues, and the airline even dropped its contract to carry US mail last year at a time when rivals have sought to 
boost cargo revenues.
The airline has limited code-sharing - selling flights for its partner ATA - andits so-called "ancillaryrevenues" remain 
lower in proportion to most US carriers.
"What we have tappedso far in terms of (extrarevenue) potential is very conservative," Mr Kellytold analysts. He 
conceded that revenue growth had slowed in the final quarter of the year, following gains which have helped the 
domestic industry record its first profitable year since 2000.
"We would be foolish to get addicted to fare increases," said Mr Kelly, though Southwest retained its goal of 
boosting earnings per share by 15 per centthis year after a 20 per cent rise in 2006 as full-yearprofits rose from 
Dollars 484mto Dollars 499m.
He said there were no troubling signs in short-term demand, with some potential upside from the return of some 
short-haul traffic after increased security measures last August pushed some travellers from the air tothe road.

An e-mail providing instructions on how to get free flights booked through the Ryanair website has been circulating 
among Irish internet users since last Friday.
The mail claims that as a result of a glitch in the website, it is possible to circumvent the low cost airlines current 
two-for-one offer and book flights for a nominal 1 cent with Ryanair paying all taxes and charges, the Irish Times 
reports.
Ryanair is running a promotion whereby customers who book a flight for travel in early February can book a second 
flight

free. 
The 
e-mail 
provides 
a 
specific 
address 
on 
the 
Ryanair 
website 
(www.ryanair.com/member/freeflights.html), which is the one provided to customers of the two-for-one offer.
 This page prompts users to enter the six-digit code they received when booking their first flight, but it now 
transpires any six digits can be entered. As a result, recipients of the e-mail have been able to avail of the free flight 
without having booked a first full-price flight.

A row between Ryanair and international broker and analyst, ABN Amro, has escalated with Ryanair refusing to co-
operate with the broker's equity researchers.
ABN Amro yesterday downgraded Ryanair to 'sell', citing concerns about fuel hedging, airport charges and high 
existing margins.
The row came to a head last January when the airline accused ABN of falsely claiming that Ryanair flights had 
been cancelled.
 Since then relations between the companies have been frosty, but Ryanair has continued to co-operate with ABN's 
aviation reports. However, yesterday's ABN aviation report bore a prominent note informing customers that 
"Ryanair has refused to have any direct contact with our analyst prior to the drafting of this note and going forward. 
"ABN AMRO regrets this but will continue to provide research coverage on Ryanair to its institutional client base."

Airport.
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will link Genoa to Frankfurt, Germany, three times weekly as of February 2007.
 In the meantime, the airline of the northern Italian region of Valle d'Aosta, Air Vallee, confirmed the operations of its 
flight to Cagliari, on the Italian island of Sardinia, even in the 2006-2007 winter season. During the weekends, the 
flight will be also operated to the airport of Olbia, on the Sardinia island.

Body
The Dublin market continued its sluggish start to 2007 today with further falls in C and C outweighing modest gains 
in Aer Lingus and McInerney.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 17.84 points lower at 9,271.32.
C and C lost 8c to 12.05 as its recent bad run continues. Shares in the Bulmers manufacturer have fallen over 10pc 
since Merrion stockbrokers downgraded the stock last week on fears that its cider brand Magners would not 
perform as well as forecast in the UK over the winter months.
 The falls in C and C overshadowed modest gains in Aer Lingus, up 6c to 2.94, on the day that the former state 
airline introduced new charges on all checked-in baggage on short haul flights. The airline will charge a E4 per bag 
fee on all bags booked in advance on the its website, while those deciding they wish to check their luggage in at the 
airport will face a charge of E8 per bag. Aer Lingus is the latest airline to add on such charges after Ryanair did so 
early last year. Shares in Ryanair closed 18c lower at 11.01 in Dublin this evening. In the construction sector, 
McInerney led the way, up 32c to 15.52, while CRH lost 30c to 30.00 and Kingspan shed 10c to 19.75. Shares in 
Grafton ended the day 19c lower on 12.01. Elsewhere, bathroom fittings company Qualceram Shires continued its 
recent positive run, climbing over 4pc, or 11c to 2.50, while farmers insurance group FBD Holdings lost 73c to 
39.47. A lacklustre opening on Wall Street added to the negative sentiment in Dublin. US shares fell back after 
stronger than expected US wholesale inflation data reawakened fears that the Federal Reserve could be about to 
raise interest rates again. Investors were also cautious ahead of release of the latest Fed Beige Book of economic 
forecasts, due out later tonight. Back on the ISEQ, shares in AIB fell 12c to 22.08, while Bank of Ireland lost 11c to 
17.11. Irish Life and Permanent was another notable faller, down 17c to 20.89, while Anglo Irish Bank managed to 
buck the trend, climbing 6c to 15.84. Other notable movers included Irish Continental, down 5c to 1510, Paddy 
Power, down 1c to 1577, and Trinity Biotech, down 11c to 1.66. Shares in cement company Readymix were down 
2c to 2.68 after it said on Tuesday that profits for 2006 will be around 28pc above those achieved in the previous 
ISEQ down 17pts despite Aer Lingus gains
year. It said this was a result of the continuing favourable economic conditions, and the benefits from a range of 
performance improvement initiatives. Davy analyst Barry Dixon said the guidance was ahead of expectations. "In 
2005, the company recorded a once-off property gain of E20.2m, implying PBT pre-exceptionals of E12.1m. This 
implies an outturn for 2006 of E15.5m," he said.

Drinks group CandC weighed heavy on the Dublin market today as it continues to suffer from last week's broker 
downgrade.
Shares in the Bulmers manufacturer closed 35c lower at 12.00 last night having fallen more than 10pc last week. 
The falls came after Merrion Stockbrokers last week lowered its recommendation on the stock to from 'buy' to 'hold'. 
It also lowered profit expectations based on evidence that Britons are drinking less of the company's Magners cider 
brand in the winter months than had been previously thought. Shares had recovered slightly in trading on Friday 
and Monday 
CandC's sluggish performance was in line with that of the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares 
slipping 102.39 points to close at 9289.16.
 A cautious opening on Wall Street also weighed on sentiment. U.S. stocks drifted back, with weaker than expected 
manufacturing data and concerns ahead of key earnings reports from Apple and Intel keeping buyers away. Having 
ended 2006 in such spectacular style, the ISEQ has struggled in the early part of this year, lagging behind the 
European benchmarks with the ISEQ underperforming the E300 by more than 3pc in 2007 to date. Davy analyst 
Robbie Kelleher said this probably represents 'no more than a partial payback for the huge outperformance by the 
ISEQ in the final quarter of 2006'. In that quarter the ISEQ was up more than 14pc against a gain of less than 7pc 
for both the top European 300 and the MSCI World Index. However, Mr Kelleher said: 'nothing has occurred so far

Aer Lingus' new charges on all checked-in baggage on short haul flights are to come into effect tomorrow.
The airline said that a E4 per bag fee will apply to bags booked in advance on the Aer Lingus website, while those 
deciding they wish to check their luggage in at the airport will face a charge of E8 per bag.
The charges will come into effect on short-haul routes for bookings made after August 8 for travel after January 17 
2007.
 Short-haul passengers will be allowed 20kg for checked-in baggage, with an allowance of 36kg for passengers on 
long-haul routes. Charges for excess baggage will remain at E8 per kilo for luggage above these amounts. Aer 
Lingus is the latest airline to add on such charges after Ryanair did so early last year. Ryanair charges customers 
E3.50 per bag, per flight if booked online or E7 per bag at the airport.

Shares on the Dublin market fell sharply today as C and C and AIB weighed heavy.
Just after 13.00, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 61.45 points to 9330.10.
Following on from last week's heavy gains, shares in drinks group C and C again plummeted, down 39c to 1196. 
Shares in the Bulmers manufacturer were hit after Merrion Stockbrokers downgraded its recommendation on the 
stock to 'hold'. It also lowered profit expectations based on evidence that Britons are drinking less of the company's 
cider brand in the winter months than had been previously thought. Shares had recovered slightly in trading on

Airport operator Fraport AG said Friday that the number of passengers using its six facilities in December and for all 
of 2006 increased because of flights to southern Europe and Asia.
All six airports reported a combined total of 73.8 million passengers in 2006, up 2.3 percent from 2005.
The majority of those figures came from Frankfurt International Airport, the third-busiest in Europe behind London's 
Heathrow Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport that serves Paris.
In 2006, more than 52.8 million passengers flew in and out of Frankfurt, up 1.1 percent from 2005. In December, 
more than 3.8 million passengers flew in and out of Frankfurt, up 4.1 percent from December 2005.
Fraport's terminal at Antalya Airport in Turkey had 5.1 million passengers, up 1 percent from last year, while Peru's 
Lima airport served 6.03 million passengers, up 6.7 percent from 2005.
At Frankfurt-Hahn Airport one of discount carrier Ryanair's major hubs, traffic rose 20.4 percent with 3.7 million 
passengers carried. Hanover Airport reported a 1.1 percent increase in traffic, with nearly 5.7 million passengers 
last year.
Saarbruecken Airport, however, had just 420,216 passengers, a 13.6 percent decline from 2005.
For the year, the six airports handled 2.6 million metric tons (2.87 million U.S. tons) of cargo, up 9.3 percent from 
2005.
Shares of Fraport were down just more than half a percent in Frankfurt trading to €55.90 (US$72.58).

C and C led the Dublin market higher today as shares in the drinks company recovered from falling more than 10pc 
yesterday after being downgraded by a leading broker.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 21.48 points to 9338.20.
Shares in the Bulmers owner fell over 100c on Thursday Merrion stockbrokers downgraded it on fears of weaker 
winter sales of its cider in Britain.
 'There has been a significantly greater degree of seasonality in Britain this year than in developed C and C markets 
in previous years,' Merrion Stockbrokers analyst Robert Brisbourne said in a research note. After surveying pubs in 
London and Birmingham and speaking to management, Brisbourne said his previous earnings forecasts for C and 
C now looked overly optimistic and that he was cutting his recommendation on the stock to "hold" from "buy". 
Brisbourne said that prior to the downgrade his expectations had been at the top end of analysts' estimates. Shares 
recovered some of their losses today, climbing 42c to 12.29. Elsewhere, financial shares were slightly higher after 
the ECB hinted on Thursday that it is likely to keep interest rates unchanged until at least March. Bank of Ireland 
jumped 6c to 17.18, while Anglo Irish Bank added on 4c to 15.83, with Irish Life and Permanent up 5c to 21.20. 
Shares in AIB were unchanged at 22.25 despite the US bank in which AIB owns a 23pc stake posted a 4pc jump in 
profits for the fourth quarter. Buffalo-based M and T said it finished the final quarter of 2006 with net income of 
USD213 million, or USD1.88 per share, in-line with analysts expectations. For all of 2006, net income rose 7pc to 
USD839 million from USD782 million in 2005. Per-share earnings improved 10pc to USD7.37 from USD6.73 over 
the same period. Davy Stockbrokers said the underlying quarterly growth was 8pc "when we have taken account of 
various one-off and non-cash items in this quarter as well as in the previous year". The broker added that full-year 
results account for 10pc of AIB profits in euro. Ryanair was up 8c to 11.40, while Donegal Creameries was also a 
notable mover, up 15c to 6.00. McInerney was up 4c to 15.05, with the building firm set to release a trading update

Highlight: Ryanair plans to double its traffic to and from Italy in the next five years
Body
Ryanair plans to double its traffic to and from Italy in the next five years, from 12 million passengers seen in year to 
March, said south Europe sales and marketing director Bridget Dowling.
Speaking at a news conference, Dowling also said that plans to overhaul regulation in Italy's air sector, particularly 
regional airport use, are 'ridiculous' and favour Alitalia SpA.
'This proposal is ridiculous. Transport minister Alessandro Bianchi has the responsibility to help Alitalia, but should 
not forget that he must encourage traffic in all regions,' she said.
 Ryanair is particularly concerned by reports the plan would restrict international flights from regional airports 
handling less than 5 million passengers per year, she said. In Italy, Ryanair operates 114 domestic and 
international routes from 22 airports across the country. Dowling said Bianchi has admitted in newspaper interviews 
he wants to help Alitalia, adding Ryanair has already 'mentioned' the Italy plan to the European Commission in their 
contacts. 'If the (proposal) goes ahead, there will certainly be consequences,' she said, without giving further 
details. Ryanair has no interest in bidding for Alitalia in the privatisation, while a new owner for the flag carrier could 
promote healthy competition, she said. Dowling also commented on local concerns about noise at Rome's 
Ciampino airport, and said Italy's sector regulator is studying the noise generated by different users, including 
Ryanair. She said Ryanair has the youngest fleet in Europe, is not to blame for the noise at Ciampino, and does not 
fly at night, noting how the airport is also used by military and carrier services. The regulator could ask users to cut 
Ciampino traffic back to 2000 levels, equivalent to halving Ryanair's 3 million passengers a year, she said. Ryanair 
is ready to leave Ciampino if the issue is not resolved, she said, adding that slots at Rome's Fiumicino airport are 
not available and would be too expensive to acquire. On expansion, Dowling said Ryanair's Italian activities are 
among the group's fastest growing. Routes from Milan to Nottingham in England, and Valladolid will be added in 
Feb-March. Ryanair could open a fourth Italian hub at Treviso in the north east, but no final decision has been 
taken, she said.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market fought back late in the day today to close slightly higher after European Central Bank 
president Jean-Claude Trichet indicated that no further interest rate hikes are likely before at least March.
The market closed in the black despite shares in drinks group CandC plummeting more than 10pc after a leading 
broker cut its rating to 'hold' from 'buy'.
Before the ECB announced that it was leaving interest rates unchanged at 3.50pc at its monthly meeting at 
lunchtime, the ISEQ was trading almost 100 points lower.
 However, the ECB decision had a rallying effect, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares fighting back to end the day 
6.10 points higher on 9316.72. The decision to keep rates unchanged this month had been widely expected, 
although many investors had expected Trichet to signal that it intends to raise rates at its next meeting on 8 
February. There was a surprise in store however, as Trichet played down any prospect of a rate rise as early as 
February, even after the Bank of England had surprised markets with an increase earlier in the day. He said the 
ECB's stance was little changed from last month. The door was left open for a March increase to keep inflationary 
pressures under control in a robust euro zone economy. He said financial markets were not wrong in expecting a 
further rise in euro zone interest rates at the end of the first quarter. Th news had a mixed effect on financial shares, 
with AIB jumping 10c to 22.25, Bank of Ireland down 7c to 17.05 and Anglo Irish Bank down 1c to 15.60. Irish Life 
and Permanent added on 2c to close at 21.15. Shares in CandC were the day's most notable faller, down 143c to 
11.87, after it was downgraded by Merrion. The broker said it has surveyed a sample of pubs in London and 
Birmingham and found "a greater degree of Magners seasonality than expected". It said this was the result of "a 
very hot British summer". "Per conversation with management there has been a significantly greater degree of 
seasonality in Britain this year than in developed CandC markets in previous years and therefore our forecasts now 
look aggressive," Merrion analyst Robert Brisbourne said. It has reducing its EPS estimates for FY07 and FY08 by 
2.5pc and 8.7pc to 53.9c and 69.9c respectively. The broker has also removed CandC from its 10 stock model 
C&C down 10pc, but ISEQ closes up on ECB
portfolio. Elsewhere on the market, shares in Donegal Creameries soared 17pc or 85c to 5.85, while Irish 
Continental Group tacked on 10c to 14.95. Meanwhile, no-frills airline Ryanair climbed 32c to 11.32, with 
Qualceram Shires up 27c to 2.45. In the construction sector, CRH was the star performer, up 27c to 30.50, while 
Kingspan added on 20c to 20.15. McInerney lost 30c to 15.00, with Grafton down 25c to 12.25.

Highlight: Ryanair welcomed the EU Ombudsman's finding on passenger compensation.
Body
Ryanair today welcomed the EU Ombudsman's finding that information contained in the EU Commission's notices 
on passenger compensation was "inaccurate and misleading". 
Ryanair and other airlines had called on the Commission several times to correct this information. 
The Ombudsman noted that this misleading information was likely to have "contributed to a considerable number of 
disputes between passengers and airlines that could have been avoided had the Commission provided accurate 
information". 
 Ryanair today also publicly called on the Commission to scrap this legislation. Commenting on the Ombudsman's 
decision, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs and Company Secretary, Jim Callaghan, said, "It is ridiculous that it 
took a decision of the Ombudsman to force the Commission to correct this inaccurate and misleading information. 
This is typical of the Commission's handling of this legislation generally. "Ryanair and all major airlines in Europe 
(including British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa) have consistently complained that this legislation is anti-
competitive and anti-consumer as it forces airlines to provide huge amounts of compensation and assistance to 
passengers for delays and cancellations, even in cases where these are completely beyond the airlines' control. 
The cost of this compensation and assistance is often several times the amount of the original fare. Other 
competing forms of transportation have no such requirements. "It is a welcome development that the EU 
Ombudsman has now forced the Commission to change this inaccurate and misleading information but we believe 
that this nonsense legislation, which does nothing for consumers except raise the cost of air travel, should now be 
scrapped and we are today calling on the Commission to do just that".

Body
Several leading airlines yesterday sought to make their passengers pay the price for the government's green 
agenda.
Gordon Brown, the chancellor, doubled air passenger duty in last month's pre-Budget report.
The higher tax will come into effect from February 1, regardless of whether they were booked before December 6, 
the date of the pre-Budget report.
Both Ryanair and Easyjet, the leading low cost carriers, said yesterday that they were e-mailing passengers, who 
had booked flights before December 6 for travel after February 1, asking them to pay the higher rate of tax.
The issue is complicated, however, and airlines are divided in their approach in dealing with passengerswho refuse 
to pay the higher tax.
Ryanair, which has an exposure of about Pounds 1.25m with 250,000 flights affected, said that if passengers 
refused to pay, they would not be allowed to fly but would be eligible for a complete refund of the fare.
Easyjet said that it hade-mailed passengers requesting the payment but was still undecided on how to deal with 
non-paying -passengers.
"We are still thinking about that one," it said. "We have not yet decided what to do about people who will not pay, 
whether to do a Ryanair and ban people from flying, or to collect it at the -airport."
Easyjet has a bigger presence in the UK market than Ryanair and said that about 800,000 flights were affected, 
creating a financial exposure of about Pounds 4m.
Virgin Atlantic said it had also decided to claim the tax from passengers but was still undecided on how best to 
collect it.
Airlines e-mail customers to seek extra tax
British Airways had previously announced that it would not pass on the taxto customers who had already booked 
their travel and it would absorb the additional Pounds 11m cost, partly because of the complexity of the task.
The low-cost carriers can contact their passengers simply, as about 98 per cent of bookings are made through the 
internet and they have e-mail addresses readily available.
Carriers such as BA and Virgin still take a lot of their bookings through other channels such as travel agents and 
call centres, however, making contact much more difficult.
Several rivals to BA claimed yesterday that it had also decided to absorb the air passenger duty cost, because it 
was still profiting from very high fuel surcharges, which it had failed to lower in recent months, unlike most airlines, 
despite the steep fall in the price of oil.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, called again on the government to withdraw air passenger duty, which he 
said was a "regressive and ineffective" tax.
"Gordon Brown will not spend any of this money on the environment," he said.
"He is just using the environment to steal more taxes from ordinary passengers," he added.

Body
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's boss, has urged the British government to tax older, more polluting aircraft and business 
class travellers.
"There is a way that tax can be aimed at aviation," he said.
"You should penalise old aircraft, you should penalise business class, you should penalise connecting travellers," 
he said, the latter referring to indirect, environmentally inefficient journeys.
 He said business class travellers were paying only a fraction of the cost of their expensive tickets, compared with 
UK plans to charge £10 on Ryanair flights where the average fare is £28. Mr O'Leary's comments come after British 
environment minister Ian Pearson was quoted last week as calling Ryanair "the irresponsible face of capitalism" 
over its stance on climate change. Mr O'Leary called for an end to "environmental hysteria" in British politics and 
media which he blamed for exaggerating the role of aviation in CO2 emissions.

Shares on the Dublin market plummeted by over 70 points today as financial and construction stocks weighed 
heavy.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 70.92 points lower on 9310.62.
The drop was in line with a negative start on Wall Street where US stocks declined as crude prices fell back once 
again.
 The falls came ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the European Central Bank where it is expected the rate setting 
council will keep rate unchanged. However, investors will be looking to the accompanying speech to see if Trichet 
gives any indication about the course for monetary policy in the coming months. Analysts believe that Trichet's use 
of the word "vigilant" at his regular monthly press conference last week to describe the ECB's stance on the threat 
posed by inflation signals that the bank is gearing up to deliver a rate hike. Anticipation of the meeting had a 
negative effect on banks in Dublin today. AIB led the fallers in the sector, down 31c to 22.07, while Bank of Ireland 
slipped 13c to 17.12. Anglo Irish Bank lost 12c to 15.61, with Irish Life and Permanent down 10c to 21.05. 
Construction shares also slipped into the red, with CRH falling 29c to 30.22 and Grafton down 13c to 12.50. 
Kingspan closed 20c lower at 19.95 on profit taking after its recent strong run. McInerney managed to buck the 
trend, adding on 10c to 15.30. The sharp fall in the market came on the day that the Irish Stock Exchange delivered 
its review of 2006. The exchange said it had enjoyed one of its best ever years last year, outperforming most of the 
other leading indices worldwide. The review shows that equity turnover was up 19pc to more than E129bn - which 
works out at an average of E511m per day, while the number of share deals done soared by 14pc to just over 
900,000. The ISE said it expects at least one major Irish company to float on the main market in 2007 with around 
seven more to join the IEX. One of those tipped by analysts to perform well this year, Ryanair, closed 1c lower at 
11.00 in Dublin this evening. This came after the no frills airline said on Tuesday that said that it plans to increase 
ISEQ down as banking shares weigh heavy
its number of passengers in Europe to over 50 million by March 2008 and double its traffic by 2012. Elsewhere, 
shares in Elan were unchanged on 10.15 despite the pharmaceutical group failing to release an update on the take-
up of its Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri. Other notable movers included drinks firm C&C, down 12c to 13.33, food 
group Kerry, down 12c to 19.78, and South Wharf, up 30c to 7.00. Shares in bookmaker Paddy Power fell on profit 
taking, down 13c to 15.87, after it posted impressive gains on Tuesday. Analysts said shares received a boost from 
a string of favourable sports results over the festive period.

Body
Low-cost airline Ryanair has written to Britain's chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown asking him to scrap 
proposals to double air passenger duty (APD).
In his pre-budget report on Dec 6, Brown said APD rates would increase from Feb 1 this year. Short-haul 
passengers in the lowest class of travel will pay £10, up from £5, and in other classes they will pay £20, up from 
£10. Long-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel will pay £40, up from £20, and in others they will pay £80, 
up from £40.
In a statement issued today, Ryanair said, 'Gordon Browns decision to double APD from £5 to £10 per ticket will 
generate over £1 billion in tax revenue for the Government. At £10 on an average £28 ticket, Ryanair passengers 
are being taxed at over 35pc. These taxes are regressive and ineffective.
 'Gordon Brown won't spend any of this money on the environment. He is just using the environment to steal more 
taxes from ordinary passengers', the airline added. The move by Ryanair comes on the back of a similar 
representation to the government made by First Choice Holidays chief executive Peter Long last month. Brown's 
decision to double APD rates was labelled as 'ridiculous' by Long. British Airways, meanwhile, said the rises were 
'highly regrettable' and accused the chancellor treating the airline industry as a 'cash cow'. Aviation experts have 
warned that the increase in duty will not have a significant impact on the 230 mln plane journeys that are made to 
and from the UK each year. Aviation consultancy CTAIRA warned that the APD increase will not affect the 
accelerating growth of British air travel, which is expected to rise by up to 6pc by 2011.

 (ANSA) - Rome, January 10 - U.S. private equity fund Texas Pacific Group (TPG) could be a possible bidder for a 
stake in Italian state-controlled airline Alitalia SpA, according to media reports from January 10, 2007.
 U.K. Merchant bank Rothschild is said to be forming a consortium of Italian and international investors to present a 
bid for Alitalia.
Analysts still consider Franco-Dutch airline Air France KLM the most potential buyer of Alitalia's stake.
 TPG has taken part in the buyout of Australian airline Qantas, alongside with Australian banking and financial 
service provider Macquarie Group. The U.S. company has also invested in Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair, as well 
as in U.S. airlines Continental Airlines and America West.
 According to the media reports, TPG might be concerned about Alitalia's two hubs in Fiumicino, near Rome, and in 
Malpensa, near Milan, northern Italy. The U.S. buyout company might also be concerned about the 2.0 bln euro ($ 
2.6 bln) valuation of the Italian group.
 Italy's Government has opened the bidding process for the sale of at least 30.1 pct of its 49.9 pct stake in Alitalia 
and will accept expressions of interest until January 29, 2007, ANSA said on January 5, 2007.

Davy Corporate Finance has been ranked as the number one financial adviser in Ireland in terms of deal value by 
international M and A analyst Mergermarket.
Davy completed 16 deals in the period January 1 2006 - December 2006 valued at E5.17 billion, almost E1 billion 
more than its nearest rival. High profile transactions included Riverdeep's E5 billion merger with US publisher 
Houghton Mifflin and Ryanair's 25pc stake in Aer Lingus.
Commenting on the performance, Hugh McCutcheon, head of corporate finance at Davy, said that 2006 was a 
record year in terms of Irish merger and acquisition activity. 
 "We are delighted to have been involved in all of the large deals in 2006 including Riverdeep's acquisition of 
Houghton Mifflin, Ryanair's stake-building in Aer Lingus, Babcock's acquisition of Eircom and South Wharf's 
disposal of the Irish Glass bottling plant," said McCutcheon. "Davy is seeing a high level of M and A dealflow in 
2007 which is being driven by the availability of cheap debt finance and our ability to raise mezzanine and equity 
funding from our institutional and private client base," he said.

Paddy Power and Irish Continental Group led the Dublin market modestly higher today, erasing some of the 
previous day's losses.
Shares in bookmaker Paddy Power soared by almost 4pc, up 60c to 16.00, after analysts said last week that the 
bookmaker had achieved favourable results in horse racing and football during the Christmas season, after 
disappointing results in October and November.
Irish Continental Group was also notably in the black, up 35c to 14.80. The Irish Ferries parent said in December 
that its underlying full year profit before tax and non-recurring items, will be ahead of current market expectations.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 43.21 points higher at 9381.54, having fallen by almost 100 points on 
Monday. Gains today were capped as investors await the outcome of the European Central Bank rate meeting on 
Thursday. It is widely expected that interest rates will be left unchanged, however, markets will be watching for any 
comment on the future direction of interest rates. Anticipation about the meeting had little effect on financial shares 
today, with Anglo Irish Bank climbing 22c to 15.72 and Bank of Ireland up 1c to 17.31. AIB and Irish Life and 
Permanent closed unchanged on 22.45 and 21.15 respectively. Shares in Total Produce - the general produce and 
distribution business of Fyffes that was demerged on December 30, 2006 - were up over 8pc, or 6c to 0.74. In the 
construction sector, McInerney led the way, up an impressive 65c to 15.20, while Grafton added 14c to 12.64 and 
Abbey. Kingspan was also a notable gainer, tacking on 27c to 20.13 following reports over the weekend that it has 
bought two UK timber frame house firms for around E20m. The Co Cavan-based firm is said to have bought Pace 
Timber Systems and Potton Ltd, both based in the English Midlands. CRH managed to buck the trend, slipping 3c 
to 30.51, despite Goodbody its full year earnings forecast for 2006 by 1.4pc to 224.1c and by 2.1pc to 249.6c for

Body
Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, today rounded on those complaining about air travel's contribution to 
global warming and called for an "informed debate" on the industry's impact on climate change.
The airline's outspoken boss bluntly blasted politicians and "environmental nutters" for "persecuting" the aviation 
industry by voicing their concerns about its effect on the planet.
Mr O'Leary said figures show that air travel compares favourably with other polluters.
 "There's a lot of bull**** being peddled, mainly by a couple of environmental nutters, that aviation is the cause of 
global warming, climate change and everything else," he said. "Every statistical record confirms air transport 
generates just 1.6pc of global greenhouse gas emissions - that's if you believe the Stern Report. If you believe EU 
environmental agency figures it's 1.8pc. Either way it's less than 2pc. So all of the middle class angst and worrying 
about flying and whether its going to damage the environment is all a load of bull****." He claims that the way to 
reduce the carbon footprint from flights was to push airlines to upgrade their planes to new models that create 50pc 
less emissions per seat, 45pc lower fuel burn and 45pc less noise. Meanwhile, Mr O'Leary said he had no plans to 
move Ryanair's check-in facilities at Dublin airport to a new purpose-built area in the basement of the terminal. The 
new area is due to be up and running by the end of the month. He went on to challenge Dublin Airport Authority to 
offer "incentives" to encourage him to do so.

Some of the owners of Asian short-haul low-cost carrier AirAsia are establishing a long-haul, low-cost carrier that 
will start operations in July with three leased aircraft.The new long-haul airline will be called AirAsia X to 
differentiate it from Malaysia-based AirAsia, but it will come under the auspices of privately held company Fly Asian 
Xpress. Its potential destinations include the UK, Australia and parts of Asia.AirAsia group chief executive Tony 
Fernandes says the new carrier will have only one aircraft type in its fleet, and the airline is evaluating the Airbus 
A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER. The carrier plans to place an order for 20 widebodies as early as this month, 
Fernandes adds.The aircraft will have a two-class configuration - "economy" with a seat pitch greater than AirAsia's, 
and "super economy" that will have "almost" flat-bed seats, says Fly Asian Xpress chief executive Raja Mohd Azmi 
Raja Razali. 
If the A330 is chosen, the aircraft will have around 400 passenger seats, including 14-21 super economy seats, he 
adds. Food and beverages will be offered, but "you will probably have to pay for these", he says.Fly Asian Xpress is 
a turboprop operation that Fernandes and his business partners established last year to take over some Malaysia 
Airlines routes within east Malaysia. The airline's other owners are Raja Azmi, who was previously AirAsia's chief 
financial officer, and AirAsia's deputy group chief executive Kamaradin Meranun. The three men are also the 
founders of the publicly listed AirAsia.The move into long haul will spark a change in Fly Asian Xpress's ownership 
structure. Conor McCarthy, the former Ryanair executive who was instrumental in helping AirAsia adopt the short-
haul low-cost carrier business model, is to be a shareholder in Fly Asian Xpress, according to Fernandes.AirAsia 
will also get a 20% stake in Fly Asian Xpress with an option for a further 10%. This is part of a deal giving Fly Asian 
Xpress a 30-year licence to use the AirAsia brand name, according to Raja Azmi. The new venture will use 
AirAsia's online booking engine but, unlike the short-haul operation, also make more use of travel agents to 
generate sales.

Ian Pearson has never knowingly caused a stir. The environment minister is a likeable but cautious technocrat who 
understands business and claims credibility with industry after a spell as trade minister.
So the minister's broadside against leading airlines he accuses of failing to take climate change seriously has 
astounded colleagues and critics alike.
Mr Pearson, 48, is one of a New Labour breed of well-educated (in his case, philosophy, politics and economics at 
Balliol College, Oxford, and a PhD in business studies from Warwick) but dull lawyers and consultants who seldom 
emerge from obscurity.
He first entered parliament in 1994, elected MP for Dudley South. He became a minister in 2002 in the Northern 
Ireland Office and from May 2005 to May 2006 was minister for trade, spending much of his time abroad promoting 
UK plc.
Before entering the Commons he was chief executive of a West Midlands-based economic development company 
providing development capital to small and medium-sized companies and consultancy to a range of public and 
private sector clients. He is regarded as a diligent and competent Blairite who is instinctively pro-business. A 
student of industrial relations, he does not go in for inflated rhetoric, let alone strident attacks on "irresponsible" 
industrialists.
As minister in charge of the water industry, he has been measured in his criticism of utilities that have failed to meet 
leakage targets even when consumer groups and the press clamoured for action.
But Mr Pearson is furious at the airlines' lobbying campaign to limit their exposure to the European Union's 
emissions trading scheme from 2011.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has meanwhile got under his skin by issuing tirades against the 
government and environmentalists who see the growth of aviation as a threat to efforts to curb emissions.
Mr Pearson's irritation got the better of him - and for once the mouse roared.

Nokia ran into heavy weather yesterday as investors took fright at an earnings warning from arch-rival Motorola.
Shares in the world's leading maker of mobile phones dropped 4.2 per cent to Euros 15.26 and were down 1.4 per 
cent over the week.
Motorola said its fourth-quarter earnings would come in below expectations because of a shortfall at its mobile 
devices unit.
"Motorola's warning leaves us in no doubt that Nokia's fourth quarter will be less than inspiring," said Per Lindberg 
at Dresdner Kleinwort, which has a price target of Euros 10.80 for Nokia.
"We maintain our negative stance on Nokia's shares in anticipation of disappointing operating results within the 
mobile device activities through 2007," Mr Lindberg added.
The market as a whole made a more positive start to 2007, although an early burst of buying activity quickly ran out 
of steam.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed yesterday at 1,486.08, up 0.2 per cent over the week, having climbed past 
1,500 on Wednesday.
The oil sector was undermined by sliding crude prices, with Statoil falling 5.9 per cent over the week to NKr155.50, 
Neste Oil dropping 5 per cent to Euros 21.89 and Total 3.5 per cent to Euros 52.75. But the prospect of lower fuel 
costs helped airline stocks push higher.
Lufthansa, up 7.8 per cent to Euros 22.47, was further helped by a spate of positive broker comments about the 
sale of its 50 per cent stake in travel group Thomas Cook at the end of last year.
Elsewhere, Air France-KLM gained 7.2 per cent to Euros 34.20 and Ryanair climbed 5.3 per cent to Euros 10.98.

Telecoms stocks were back in demand as investors rotated into the sector from utilities. Dutch fixed-line operator 
KPN ended the week at Euros 11.30, a rise of4.9 per cent, while Deutsche Telekom added 4.4 per cent to Euros 
14.45 and Telecom Italia gained 3.1 per cent to Euros 2.36.
Utility stocks were hurt by fears of a crackdown on energy companies by European Union regulators after an inquiry 
into the sector found evidence of collusion and other market failings.
Eon dropped 5.4 per cent to Euros 97.26, RWE shed3.6 per cent to Euros 80.50 and Veolia Environnement 
tumbled 9.2 per cent to Euros 53.05. Veolia had risen sharply at the end of the year on vague speculation that it 
might be a target for an investment fund.
Meanwhile, Suez remained in focus as the fate of its proposed merger with Gaz de France continued to hang in the 
balance.
Suez shares hit an all-time high of Euros 40.50 after reports that Francois Pinault, the French billionaire, was 
considering a break-up bid for the company.
However, the stock then staged a sharp retreat, closing yesterday at Euros 38.42, down 2.1 per cent on the week, 
while GdF fell 1 per cent to Euros 34.50.
Albert Frere, the Belgian tycoon, yesterday raisedhis stake in Suez from 8 per cent to about 9 per cent, which 
analysts said might strengthen the company's defence against a hostile bid.

Pearson brought to earth in airline row CLIMATE CHANGE

A minister who accused leading European airlines of failing to take climate change seriously was slapped down by 
government colleagues and industry critics yesterday.
Ian Pearson, the minister for climate change, came under fire after he branded Ryanair, Europe's leading budget 
airline, the "irresponsible face of capitalism" because it refused to accept air travel was a main contributor to global 
warming.
He accused Lufthansa of leaning on the German government, holder of the European Union presidency, to dilute 
plans to include aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme, said British Airways was "only just playing ball" on the 
need to curb emissions and US airlines were a "disgrace".
The outburst in an interview with The Guardian prompted Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, to say the 
minister was "foolish and ill-informed".
"Like most politicians, Minister Pearson talks a lot but does little," Mr O'Leary said. Being criticised by him was like 
being "savaged by a dead sheep".
Mr Pearson was also rebuked by colleagues, who said his remarks contradicted the government's policy of working 
with industry to curb emissions.
The minister said last night he was standing by his remarks but did "not want to get into a war of words". An 
environment department figure said Mr Pearson had been rebuked and told: "Get back in your box and stay there." 
He added: "We want to be at the centre of government decision-making not an arm of Greenpeace."
Environmentalists say urgent action is needed to slow the expansion of air travel, now the fastest growing source of 
carbon emissions in the UK economy.
However, government policy is to support the growth of the airline industry and build more runways in the south-
east. Ministers have been keen to shift the debate from raising the cost of air travel through green taxes, which 
could prove politically unpopular.
Pearson brought to earth in airline row CLIMATE CHANGE
Although air passenger duty was doubled in the pre-Budget report, this was seen first and foremost as a revenue 
raising measure rather than an attempt to price passengers out of the skies.
BA said it was "totally committed" to addressing its climate change impact and suggested the government was 
guilty of environmental hypocrisy.
"It is ironic that the environment minister is making these claims when the Treasury doubled air passenger duty a 
month ago as an environment tax without giving any guarantees that any of it will be spent on environment 
projects."
BA said Willie Walsh, its chief executive, had written to Gordon Brown last month calling on the government to use 
the proceeds from APD to reduce aviation's contribution to climate change radically by investing in renewable 
energy projects. He had not received a reply.
The airline said it had lobbied for seven years for aviation to be included in an emissions trading scheme and it was 
the only airline in the world that was actively trading carbon emissions.
The government's hopes of curbing aviation emissions rest on including the sector in the ETS from 2011, as 
proposed by the European Commission last month. But with flag carriers lobbying hard to reduce their exposure to 
the scheme and US airlines resisting inclusion it is far from a done deal.
Mr Pearson is understood to be frustrated by this rearguard action and singled out Mr O'Leary for criticism. He 
might also have been keen to outflank the Conservatives, who have put the environment at the centre of their 
political renaissance. Last month they identified Mr O'Leary as an "environmental villain" of 2006.
Mr O'Leary said airlines were neither the cause of nor the solution to climate change. The Stern report had 
confirmed that the airline industry accounted for only 1.6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Mr Pearson had said nothing about road transport, which accounted for 18 per cent of CO emissions, or power 
generation, which accounted for more than 25 per cent, Mr O'Leary added.
Ryanair, he said, was Europe's "greenest airline" after spending over Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in the past five 
years on new aircraft, which had cut its fuel consumption by 45 per cent per seat and its noise and CO emissions 
by 50 per cent per seat.
EasyJet, however, congratulated Mr Pearson. Andy Harrison, chief executive, said the airline welcomed a carbon 
trading scheme and wanted the European parliament to bring in tougher legislation sooner.
Environmentalists also welcomed Mr Pearson's remarks but said there was a gulf between government rhetoric and 
action. "It's time the world woke up to the colossal threat . . . from cheap flights and took steps to curb them," said 
Friends of the Earth.
However, with emissions trading controlled by the EU, tax by the Treasury and aviation policy by the Department for 
Transport, rhetoric may be Mr Pearson's most powerful tool.

From Mr Guy Bague.
Sir, Tyler Brule's tacit endorsement to ignore regulations concerning liquids on flights in his final FT piece of 
December 30/31 is a foolish and irresponsible end to a great column.
That the narcissism of sneaking your favourite Swedish organic moisturiser or expensive Japanese seaweed anti-
ageing serum on to a flight would take precedence over the security of fellow passengers adds depressing 
credibility to the castigation of business-class travellers as boors by Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the 
budget airline.

Britain's junior environment minister accused airlines on both sides of the Atlantic of irresponsibility over reduction 
of carbon emissions to combat global warming, a newspaper said Friday.
Ian Pearson, who is responsible for climate change issues, criticized the opposition of major American and 
European airlines to a European Union proposal urging cuts in emissions from aircraft.
The EU has set out plans that will require all airlines to trade carbon emissions for all flights to and from European 
airports starting in 2012. Airlines would be given a carbon allowance meaning companies that do not use the full 
amount could sell unused limits.
Pearson criticized U.S. carriers in an interview with The Guardian newspaper.
"They just seem to be saying they don't want anything to do with the trading scheme, and that they will take the EU 
to court if trans-Atlantic flights are included. It is completely irresponsible," Pearson was quoted as saying.
Pearson also was quoted as telling the newspaper that Michael O'Leary, chief executive of budget Irish carrier 
Ryanair, had failed to recognize the importance of tackling climate change.
"When it comes to climate change, Ryanair are not just the unacceptable face of capitalism, they are the 
irresponsible face of capitalism," Pearson was quoted as saying. "O'Leary just seems to take pride in refusing to 
recognize that climate change is a genuine problem."
Pearson also criticized German airline Lufthansa, which has opposed the curbs on emissions.
O'Leary told Irish state broadcaster RTE that Pearson "hasn't a clue what he's talking about."
He said Ryanair had spent 10 billion euros ($13 billion) over the past five years building a fleet of Boeing 737-800s 
that were "the cleanest and greenest in Europe."
Climate minister criticizes airlines in U.S. , Europe over carbon emissions stance
O'Leary rejected the notion that aircraft were a significant generator of greenhouse gases. He said power plants 
were responsible for a quarter of the world's carbon emissions, while aviation accounted for less than 2 percent.
He said the fuel efficiency standards of the latest Boeing 737-800s meant Ryanair had cut its carbon emissions per 
aircraft by 50 percent and its fuel consumption by 45 percent since 2000.
"We're clearly not part of the problem. We are reducing our emissions. It's about time the media stopped rehashing 
the stupid lies being put about by these idiot politicians," O'Leary told RTE.
Richard Dyer, spokesman for the environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth, said the minister was correct 
to express concern but called on the government to give up plans to increase capacity at British airports.
"Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of pollution. It's time the world woke up to the colossal threat to our 
environment from cheap flights and took steps to curb them," Dyer said.
Last December, the EU said its carbon-trading proposals could see the cost of a typical return flight within Europe 
rise by between $2.37 and $11.84, with higher price increases for long-haul trips.

Body
The Dublin market ended the final session of the first week of 2007 in a positive manner this evening buoyed by a 
near 15pc gain in scaffolding and fencing firm Siteserv.
Shares in the growth orientated firm, which only joined the market last November ended the day 17c higher at 1.35. 
The gains mean that Siteserv's share price has gone up 135pc in just two months. Since it's flotation the firm has 
announced two major takeover deals - the E27m purchase of scaffolding provider Easy Access and the E19m 
acquisition of infrastructure operator Holgate Fencing. It was also tipped as a minor stock to watch in 2007 by 
broker Goodbody.
Siteserv helped lead the ISEQ index of Irish shares close 38.36 points higher on 9432.84.
 A slow start on Wall Street failed to dampen investor sentiment in Dublin, as stronger-than-expected key U.S. jobs 
data dashed hopes of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut. According to the Labour Department, the US 
added 167,000 jobs in December, higher than the 100,000 jobs economists had expected, while the unemployment 
rate was in-line at 4.5pc. Back in Dublin, the market was also boosted by a strong performance in the financial 
sector, where Bank of Ireland added on 20c to 17.45 and Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 10c to 15.50. AIB was up 5c to 
22.85, while Irish Life & Permanent jumped 30c to 21.40. Shares in Glanbia closed almost 4pc higher as the food 
group continues to enjoy strong trading after it announced the sale of its remaining stake in The Cheese Company 
last week. Shares were up 17c to 3.34 yesterday. In the construction sector, Grafton was a notable mover, up 13c 
to 12.33, while CRH added on 2c to 30.77 after it said earlier in the week that it expects full-year pretax profit to rise 
over 23pc to about E300m. Meanwhile, McInerney added on 5c to 14.73, with Kingspan unchanged on 19.95. 
Other notable movers today included, business support services group DCC, down 67c to 25.15, drinks group 
CandC, down 2c to 13.48, and pharmaceutical group Elan, down 29c to 10.41. Shares in Ryanair closed 16c higher 
at 10.98 after it hit back at a UK government minister's claims that major airlines are failing to take climate change

Ian Pearson were 'foolish and ill-informed'. Pearson had branded Ryanair as the 'irresponsible face of capitalism' 
and said O'Leary was refusing to recognise climate change as a genuine problem. Elsewhere, shares in Aer Lingus 
closed 4c higher at 2.73, while Waterford Wedgwood remained unchanged on 0.08 after it reported its best 
Christmas trading period in five years. In a trading update on Thursday, the company said group sales between the 
beginning of April 2006 and year end were broadly in line with the same period in the previous financial year, but 
December's retail performance was very encouraging.

1.6 pct of greenhouse gases, isn't it time that Minister Pearson and other equally foolish politicians actually tackled 
the real causes of climate change?' O'Leary said. Pearson believes the predicted growth in airlines' carbon 
emissions are such a threat to thegovernment's plans to cut emissions by 60 pct by 2050 that he wants the

Deutsche Telekom spearheaded a rally for the telecommunications sector after the stock broke back through a key 
level.
DT shares closed above Euros 14 on Wednesday for the first time since May last year, paving the way for them to 
climb a further 2.7 per cent yesterday to Euros 14.45.
Telecoms were among the worst-performing stocks in 2006, with DT shedding1.7 per cent, although several 
brokers have recommended an "overweight" stance on the sector in 2007.
KPN, the Dutch operator, yesterday rose 3.2 per cent to Euros 11.26, Hellenic Telecom added 3.5 per cent to Euros 
24 and France Telecom firmed up 1.4 per cent to Euros 21.68. The fixed-line sector as a whole gained 1.7 per cent.
Among the mobile operators, Cosmote rose 3.3 per cent to Euros 22.98 and Telenor added 1.5 per cent to NKr120.
The broader market looked less happy as it retreated from Wednesday's near six-year high.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 3.81 points, or0.25 per cent, to 1,499.03.
There was no respite for oil stocks as crude prices continued to slide. Neste Oil shed 3 per cent to Euros 22.04, 
Statoil lost 3.7 per cent to NKr157.25 and Total slipped 2 per cent to Euros 53.45.
The dip in crude prices helped airline stocks rally on expectations that fuel prices would ease. Lufthansa rose 2.1 
per cent to Euros 21.96. Dresdner Kleinwort raised its price target on the stock from Euros 21.60 to Euros 26 and 
reiterated a "buy" recommendation after the disposal of its 50 per cent stake in theThomas Cook travel group.
Air France-KLM rose1.2 per cent to Euros 33.12 while Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, climbed 3.6 per cent to 
Euros 10.80. The latter said it carried 19 per cent more passengers in December than a year earlier, but its load 
factor - a measure of how full its aircraft were - was down.

The Supreme Court is due to deliver a ruling in a case brought by IMPACT that the airline is underpaying pilots.
"We are confident of winning this Supreme Court challenge. These are just more rubbish claims from the Aer

The IMPACT trade union, which represents 1,000 Ryanair pilots, said pilots in the company are being paid 
substantially less than other airlines.
 IMPACT said it was "confident" the High Court ruling, which was categoric about the entitlement of the state's 
industrial relations apparatus to rule in the case of pay disputes of Ryanair's pilots, would be upheld by the 
Supreme Court. It is due to hear the case on January 31. If the ruling favours the pilots, the airline faces a huge

Body
Sluggish financial shares weighed heavy on the Dublin market today as the ISEQ's volatile start to 2007 continued.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 31.59 points lower on 9394.48
Shares in AIB fell 24c to 22.76 despite being named by NCB Stockbrokers as a stock worth following in the year 
ahead. Other shares mentioned included, Irish Life and Permanent, Ryanair and C and C.
 The market's mixed start to the year has came after both NCB and Davy predicted that while the economy and 
corporate markets are healthy, the ISEQ will struggle to match the 26pc gain seen last year. It has increased by 
well over 20pc for the past three years. "2007 equity market gains may not match those of 2004-2006, but the 
corporate earnings outlook remains positive, supported by an economic backdrop that is buoyant in Ireland, 
encouraging in mainland Europe, stable in the UK and on track for a soft landing in the US," said NCB. Davy, 
meanwhile, is forecasting that the ISEQ will increase in value by between 15 and 20pc this year. In Dublin today, 
shares in CRH were a major faller, down 33c to 30.71, on profit taking after the building materials group said on 
Wednesday that it expects to report a 23pc surge in profits for 2006. The company, the second largest on the Irish 
Stock Exchange, said that profits are likely to be up E300m on the 2005 figure of E1.279bn. CRH is due to issue its 
preliminary results for 2006 in early March. Elsewhere in the construction sector, shares in Kingspan fell 22c to 
19.98, while Grafton lost 20c to close at 12.20. McInerney slipped 12c to 14.68. Among the other banks, Anglo Irish 
fell 15c to 15.45, while Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent managed slight gains, up 2c to 17.24 and 10c

Bookmaker Paddy Power closed in the red, down 25c to 15.05, while business support services firm DCC

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has started a legal action against the French government to overturn a 
French labour decree, which applies French social security charges to employees of foreign airlines.
The airline said the labour decree was "contrary to the European free market for airline services and is a clear 
attempt to protect Air France from competition".
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair head of regulatory affairs and company secretary, said the decree tried to force foreign 
airlines to apply French labour laws when they based aircraft in France.
He said the decree was "clearly designed to discourage foreign airlines from establishing a base of operations in 
France in order to compete with the high fare monopoly, Air France".
The airline has also filed a complaint with the European Commission calling on it to overturn the decree.
Ryanair opened its first operating base in France last November at Marseille with two aircraft based initially at the 
airport with a network of 14 routes including three to Morocco, two to the UK and two to Germany.
The French government is trying to force the airlines, most significantly Ryanair and EasyJet, to move the staff they 
employ on French soil from British employment contracts to more expensive French ones.
The airlines are resisting the switch, which would force them to pay higher social security charges on their 
employees and improve their channels of employee and union representation.
The dispute is part of the French government's efforts to prevent low-cost carriers gaining an unfair advantage over 
Air France-KLM, the partially state-owned flag carrier. But the low-cost airlines suspect Paris of trying to protect its 
domestic market from foreign rivals. Air France-KLM is launching its own French low-cost subsidiary, 
Transavia.com, in April.
Ryanair starts French action TRAVEL & LEISURE
EasyJet has been charged with "concealed work" and "impeding staff representation bodies" after the company's 
offices in Paris's Orly airport, were raided last month by officials. The company argues its crew do not work in 
France but on its aircraft under a British flag.

Ryanair Holdings PLC announced a lawsuit Wednesday against the French government, arguing that newly 
imposed labor taxes are illegally hampering the budget airline's operations.
Ryanair said it also has petitioned European Union competition authorities in Brussels, Belgium, in hopes of 
overturning the application of tax and other French labor standards on Ryanair employees based in France.
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's director of regulatory affairs, said France "tries to force foreign airlines to apply French 
labor laws when they base aircraft in France."
"This is contrary to European laws on free movement of labor and services and the freedom of establishment, and 
is also contrary to the liberalized air transport market," Callaghan said. "This decree is clearly designed to 
discourage foreign airlines from establishing a base of operations in France in order to compete with the high-fare 
monopoly, Air France."
Dublin-based Ryanair, which is the fastest-growing airline in Europe, said it had filed its suit in the Council of State, 
France's highest administrative court.
Last month rival budget airline easyJet PLC filed its own challenge to the tax in the same court. EasyJet spokesman 
Toby Nicol said the airline took its action shortly before French prosecutors opened a probe into the alleged 
employment of 130 easyJet staff under British labor contracts at Orly Airport south of Paris.
Ryanair runs services to and from 18 French airports, and last year opened its first French hub in Marseilles that 
operates routes to 14 European destinations. Ryanair previously has claimed France was seeking to hamper 
Ryanair's expansion on French soil, an accusation rejected by French authorities.
A French government spokesman did not immediately return calls Wednesday seeking comment on the Ryanair 
move.
Ryanair's lawsuit takes issue with a Nov. 23 government decree requiring foreign airlines to pay French labor taxes 
on employees working inside the country.

A spokeswoman for Air France-KLM, Veronique Brachet, refused to comment on Ryanair's claims or on its lawsuit.

its French staff to comply with the law.

American depositary shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC soared to a 52-week high on Wednesday amid lower crude 
oil prices. An analyst also raised his price target on the Irish discount airline by $36.
A barrel of high-quality crude oil gave up $2.50 cents to $58.55 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Jet fuel, 
which is refined from crude oil, is among the industry's top costs.
Ryanair shares climbed $3.45, or 4 percent, to $84.95 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after topping out at a yearly 
high of $85.28 earlier in the session. In a previous 52-week range, the stock has traded in a range of $46.47 to 
$82.22.
On Tuesday, Prudential Equity Group analyst Bob McAdoo raised his price target to $108 from $72 and kept an 
"Overweight" rating on the shares.
McAdoo said his fiscal 2008 of $4.49 per share includes lower fuel prices, capacity growth around 20 percent, and 
slight improvements in unit costs offset by slightly lower revenue per passenger from a year ago.
McAdoo also said operating and net margins for fiscal 2008 are slightly higher than his estimated fiscal 2007 
margins, due mostly to lower jet fuel costs.
Still, McAdoo warned that fluctuations in the price of fuel, among other factors, can affect airline stocks.
"Although we believe the airline industry is returning to a more profitable state, fuel prices could climb again to 
record levels or beyond," McAdoo wrote in a client note. "If this were to occur, all airline shares would likely be hit, 
and could return to the low levels not seen since fall 2004."

Body
Glowing accolades from brokers for this morning's profit forecast by CRH failed to prevent the construction giant's 
shares slipping this morning.
Its shares slipped by 30c to 3125 after its trading statement which indicated that profits for the year will rise by 23pc 
to nearly 1.3 billion euro.
Dolmen has called the statement "very strong", Goodbody advised a "buy" despite recent rises in the share's price, 
and Davy hailed a "strong performance in all divisions".
 The slippage came on a morning of big falls on the Dublin market, which brought the ISEQ index 80 points lower 
by around midday to 9,457. Profit taking from yesterday's big rise had a part to play. But the main downward thrust 
came from falls in financial stocks, hit by the latest housing figures confirming a drop in Dublin house prices. They 
were also hit by eurozone PMI data yesterday which has raised the likelihood of two European Central Bank rate 
rises this year rather than one. AIB shares dipped by 32c this morning to 2318, Bank of Ireland was down 17c to 
1735, Anglo Irish Bank dropped 20c to 1550, and Irish Life and Permanent was off by 5c to 2105. Other big fallers 
this morning were Grafton, down 20c to 1250; Kingspan, dropping 34c to 2013; and Irish Continental Group, off by 
40c to 1460. Ryanair dipped 8c to 1057.

The Conservative party has stepped up criticism of big business by including several multinational companies and 
leading industrialists in its list of environmental villains of 2006.
Among the targets singled out for criticism are Exxon Mobil, the US oil group, Thames Water, Bayer, the German 
chemicals group and Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, the low-cost airline. They are deemed to be 
"part of the problem" of global warming.
Conversely, the Tories have identified their environmental heroes as, among others, a Page Three girl who offers 
readers useful tips on fighting global warming, Sir David Attenborough, the veteran presenter of BBC nature 
programmes, and the Women's Institute for its campaign against unnecessary packaging.
David Cameron has made a more distant relationship with business one of the hallmarks of his leadership of the 
Conservative party.
Most recently he caused dismay by pulling out of the CBI annual conference to visit UK troops in Iraq. He has also 
criticised what he sees as the socially and environmentally "irresponsible" actions of big business.
In their league table of villains, the Conservatives censure Exxon Mobil for "continuing to fund "think tanks which 
deny that human activity is contributing to climate change".
Mr O'Leary is damned for "refusing to face up to aviation's impact on the environment", and Thames Water for 
failing to meet leak targets while recording a 33 per cent jump in pre-tax profits.
Bayer is branded a villain over the release of untested genetically modified rice for sale in the UK and Europe.
Among the heroes, the Conservatives praise Sir Nicholas Stern for his influential review on the economics of 
climate change, Al Gore, the former US vice president for his film An Inconvenient Truth, and Prince Charles for 
creating one of the most high profile and successful organic brands, Duchy Originals.

Profit taking pulls ISEQ lower in last session of the year
Profit taking across the board yesterday ended a highly successful year on the Dublin stock market.
And, although almost all the big stocks ended slightly lower on the day, it did little to take the shine off the year's 
remarkable rises.
After marking time in the first half of the year, the ISEQ index of Irish shares really took off in July and hasn't looked 
back since. After passing the landmark 9,000 level a few weeks before Christmas, it then hit an all time high on 
Thursday of this week at 9,453.05 before slipping on yesterday's profit taking to 9,409.12. Among the major names, 
CRH dipped 1c yesterday to 3154 on the last day for dealing in the shares prior to the group's scheduled trading 
update on 3rd January. Among the banks, it was also a case of moving south, with AIB off by 36c to 2250, Anglo 
Irish Bank dropping 11c to 1571 and Irish Life & permanent down by 10c to 2090. Bank of Ireland managed to buck 
the trend, however, with a 9c rise to 1750. The market took the big Fyffes announcement of three board changes in 
its stride. Chairman Carl McCann is going, along with finance director Frank Gernon and Rory Byrne, who heads its 
general produce division. Fyffes says the changes have to do with the spinoff of the general produce operation. Its 
shares remained unmoved yesterday at 178. Food group Glanbia saw its shares dip 14c, or more than 4pc, to 296 
on news that it had sold its minority stake in The Cheese Company, Britain's biggest cheesemaker. The dip was in 
recognition that the sale will result in an exceptional charge of 9.2m euro in Glanbia's end-of-year statement, 
relating to the discounting of loan notes as part of the deal. Aer Lingus shares recovered 4c to 274 yesterday, thus 
regaining almost all of their 5c drop on Thursday prompted by news of a 3.1percentage point drop in the airline's 
November load factor. Conversely, Ryanair dipped by 5c to 1043. Among other notable movers yesterday was 
Kerry Group, which was again out of favour because of doubts on its current prospects. It dipped by 102c to 1780. 
Also on the way down was Paddy Power, which lost 24c to 1506m , and Irish Continental Group, down 12c to 1390. 
It was a short session finishing at lunchtime, with low volumes traded. All eyes are now on the New Year and 
whether the Dublin market can continue its remarkable rises of 2006.

Discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has lost its battle to win control of an Internet domain name from a 
disgruntled former customer, according to a ruling issued by a United Nations panel Wednesday.
Michael Coulston of London set up a Web site critical of Ryanair's business practices in July under the domain 
name http://www.ryanaircampaign.org.
The Irish carrier complained to the World Intellectual Property Organization that the domain name infringed on its 
trademarks and should therefore be transferred into Ryanair's possession.
But a WIPO panel said there was no evidence that Coulston, who runs a private online campaign aimed at 
informing Ryanair customers of ways in which they can complain to the company about its service, was using the 
domain name in bad faith.
The U.N. arbitration system, which started in 1999, allows those who think they have the right to a domain to get it 
back without having to fight a costly legal battle or pay large sums of money.

disgruntled former customer, according to a ruling issued by a United Nations panel Wednesday.
Michael Coulston of London set up a Web site critical of Ryanair's business practices in July under the domain 
name http://www.ryanaircampaign.org.
The Irish carrier complained to the World Intellectual Property Organization that the domain name infringed on its 
trademarks and should therefore be transferred into Ryanair's possession.
But a WIPO panel said there was no evidence that Coulston, who runs a private online campaign aimed at 
informing Ryanair customers of ways in which they can complain to the company about its service, was using the 
domain name in bad faith.
The U.N. arbitration system, which started in 1999, allows those who think they have the right to a domain to get it 
back without having to fight a costly legal battle or pay large sums of money.
Ryanair 
had 
previously 
succeeded 
in 
forcing 
Coulston 
to 
hand 
over 
another 
domain 
name, 
http://www.ryanair.org.uk, by lodging a complaint with Nominet UK, an organization responsible for Web domains 
ending in the .UK suffix.

Necessity proved to be the mother of invention when I found myself having to plan a last-minute trip to Vienna this 
winter. A Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Graz deposited me just over a couple of hours' train journey from 
Vienna. To get home two days later, my best bet was to head across the border to the Czech city of Brno, an hour-
and-a-half north of the Austrian capital. None of this seemed ideal, but I decided to sit back and enjoy the journey.
With its impressive but compact centre, full of handsome historic buildings, Graz provides a rewarding introduction 
to Austrian culture. The city combines a parochial self-regard coloured by an unexpected dynamism. With one of 
the highest standards of living in Europe, the people of Graz have a surface formality, yet more than occasionally a 
radical edge. This is a lively university town, proud of its forward-looking culture, home to numerous museums, 
galleries and music festivals.
This progressive spirit is expressed in Graz's new art gallery, the Kunsthaus. Created by the British architects Peter 
Cook and Colin Fournier, it sits incongruously in historic surroundings, like an invading giant slug sucking against 
the banks of the river Mur.
Climbing up to the ancient clock tower at the top of the Schlossberg, the wooded hill that rises out of Graz's 
atmospheric medieval quarter, you look out across a landscape that, with its sunny, vine-covered slopes, isn't a 
million miles away from Tuscany. One tip: don't mention Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Keen to emphasise 
their cultural credentials, the people of Graz don't want to be reminded that the erstwhile purveyor of Hollywood 
action schlock is the town's most famous son.
Graz has an essentially provincial feel but stand on any platform at the Hauptbahnhof, the city's main station, and 
you get the exhilarating feeling of being at the centre of things. It's a lesson in the imperial history of Mitteleuropa, 
written in rail. The aggressive economic and political expansionism of the Habsburgs and their Austro-Hungarian 
successors in the 19th century has left its mark on the sheer possibilities of European travel: trains draw into Graz 
Mitteleuropa at its best There are still destinations that offer relaxed experiences and none of the cattle-market 
scrum that is present in most European airpor....
station en route from Zagreb and Ljubljana in the south to Prague and Krakow in the north. The border with 
Hungary is less than an hour away to the east, bringing Budapest within easy reach; the spectacular transalpine 
railroad to the west takes you to Venice in half a day.
My train from Graz to Vienna had started its journey in Croatia. I settled into a compartment plastered with signs in 
Serbo-Croat, which I presumed said something like "No Smoking", until the man sitting opposite me leaned over 
and offered me a strong Turkish cigarette. I declined but as he lit up, the aromatic smoke seemed to tinge the 
journey with nostalgia. My route took me through the eastern fringes of the Alps; gentle, forested hills, glowing with 
the sepia and gold of late autumn, gave way to deep, romantic ravines and castles set on impossibly sheer 
outcrops, with glimpses of snow-capped Alpine peaks in the middle-distance. The plaintive melodies of Schubert's 
Winterreise went in and out of my head.
Encountering a real border-crossing in Europe, in these days of Schengen visas and free trade, is something of a 
thrill. As you approach the Czech Republic from Austria, there is an air of old-fashioned formality as the severely 
uniformed Czech guards pass through the train with the unsettling cry of "Documents please!". Across the border lie 
the flat plains of Moravia, bleakly beautiful with the wintry morning sun glimmering through a low mist.
Brno, the Moravian capital, is the Czech Republic's gritty second city, delightfully free of the tourist jamboree that 
accompanies any visit to Prague, a couple of hours to the north. Dubbed the "Moravian Manchester" by some 
unhelpful tourism agency, the city preserves a refreshingly ramshackle and unpretentious Eastern Bloc charm after 
the splendour of its Austrian neighbours. In spite of its industrial reputation, Brno has an architectural heritage that 
includes fine buildings from Baroque to Bauhaus, and its crumbling medieval centre is crowned by the grimly 
imposing spire of Petrov cathedral. (Brno is also the birthplace of composer Leos Janacek.) A tram system, with 
classic postwar rolling stock, criss-crosses the cobbled streets, and at lunchtime, the city's deep restaurant cellars 
teem with workers tucking into cheap but delicious beer and sausages.
At the start of my journey I had regarded Brno as merely an escape route from an impossibly over-booked Vienna. 
In fact, there's plenty to keep a visitor interested for a few days, and precious few tourists to disturb you while you're 
there. But all that looks set to change. The opening of a fabulous new terminal, a space-age pod of steel and glass 
straight out of James Bond, at Brno's Turany Airport heralds an influx of tourists that is bound to change the 
character of the city. The terminal has been built to process a thousand passengers a day, but for now is gloriously 
empty. The only scheduled services are to London and Munich, with Ryanair operating one flight between Brno and 
Stansted a day. Flying from Brno was hassle-free travel as it used to be, with none of the cattle-market scrum that 
characterises most European airports these days. Enjoy it while it lasts.

Northern Ireland airport forced to publish subsidy deal with Ryanair
Northern Ireland airport forced to publish subsidy deal with Ryanair

Ryanair Holdings PLC received 250,000 pounds (€375,000; US$490,000) a year and a range of taxpayer-
subsidized benefits to use an airport in the northwest corner of Ireland, the airport's government owners 
acknowledged Friday.
The Derry City Council, owners of City of Derry Airport near Northern Ireland's second-largest city, made the 
acknowledgment after losing two cases during a yearlong legal battle with the British news agency Press 
Association. The agency sought the information under Britain's Freedom of Information Act.
The document, which was not published on the Derry City Council's Web site but e-mailed to The Associated Press 
by the council, confirmed that Ryanair Europe's fastest-growing and most aggressively marketed airline began 
flying into City of Derry Airport in 1999 only on condition that the council-owned airline foot most of the bill.
Derry City Council, the second-largest council in the British territory of Northern Ireland, said parts of the deal were 
supposed to run until July 2009 but were withdrawn in December 2005 because they violated European Union 
competition laws on attracting business to regional airports.
Ryanair declined to comment on the document, which indicated the airline received more than 1.5 million pounds 
(€2.25 million, US$3 million) in payments "for purposes of promotion and operations consultancy."
Ryanair, which specializes in using out-of-the-way, privately owned airports to reduce its operating expenses, 
frequently complains when other European airlines receive financial aid from governments.
But the Dublin-based airline has already been forced to pay back more than €4 million (US$5 million) in benefits it 
received from another state-owned airport in Charleroi, Belgium, after European competition authorities ruled these 
in violation of EU law.
Derry City Council, meanwhile, has faced intense scrutiny over its management of the airport. During the legal 
action, the council confirmed it has been losing an average of 1.5 million pounds (€2.3 million, US$3 million) a year 
nearly double its revenues and taxpayers cover the shortfall.
Northern Ireland airport forced to publish subsidy deal with Ryanair
Londonderry journalist Eamonn McCann, who has reported extensively on the Ryanair-Derry airport deal, accused 
the council of wasting taxpayers' money and releasing the information at moment when it was likely to attract the 
least newsprint.
"The council has waited until the brink of Christmas, when it might be a good time to bury news that they never 
wanted put out in the first place," McCann said.
"For Ryanair, negotiating with the council was like taking candy from a baby. The council was so anxious to do 
Ryanair's bidding for them they gave them everything they asked for in terms of ratepayers' money," he said.
The four-page document, a March 1999 letter from a Ryanair representative, spelled out the airline's conditions for 
opening a daily service between City of Derry Airport and Ryanair's biggest base, Stansted Airport northeast of 
London.
It said the airline would expect to receive the 250,000-pound payment and pay no additional costs to the airport 
other than a flat 100-pound (€149, US$196) fee per landing aircraft. This fee was to cover all the usual charges for 
passengers, baggage, air traffic control and other airport services.
The document emphasized that airport authorities must bear the cost for a range of staff and facilities, including 
computers and ticket-printing machines.
Tony McGurk, chief executive officer of Derry City Council, said four state bodies contributed almost equally to the 
250,000-pound annual payment: the Derry council; a Republic of Ireland council in the neighboring county of 
Donegal; and the state tourism boards for both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
McGurk said the payment was cut off in December 2005. He said the airport was currently charging Ryanair 3 
pounds (€4.47; US$5.90) per passenger and 1 pound (€1.49; US$1.96) per bag.
Ryanair services at City of Derry Airport have expanded to four routes today, linking northwest Ireland to London, 
the largest Scottish city of Glasgow, Liverpool in northwest England, and the East Midlands region of England.

Relief in sight for thousands of stranded holiday travelers at London's Heathrow airport

Relief was in sight for thousands of stranded travelers at Heathrow Airport on Friday after forecasters said the thick, 
freezing fog that forced flight cancellations and delays for four days should begin to lift.
Dry air from the south was expected to help remove the blanket of fog around Europe's busiest airport by Saturday 
morning, forecasters said. "While it may remain gray and misty, the key factor visibility should improve 
considerably," Meteorological Office spokesman Keith Fenwick said.
Heathrow built on flat, grassy land and surrounded by reservoirs and canals is particularly vulnerable to fog.
British Airways canceled 170 incoming and outgoing flights Friday, 84 of them domestic and the rest short-haul to 
Europe. While the airline's long-haul services were still operational, some departing passengers were expected to 
face delays of several hours.
"At this stage we are hopeful that the weather will improve slightly over the weekend and therefore we can get back 
to operating a full planned Christmas Eve schedule," Geoff Want, director of ground operations at British Airways, 
said in a statement.
The airline said it would be able to fly 95 percent of customers on Saturday, adding that it was already operating 80 
percent of short haul flights. "We're seeing a gradual improvement," spokeswoman Amanda Poole said.
Airport operator BAA warned that an immediate resumption of full services was unlikely because the cancellations 
had stranded jets and cabin crews across Europe.
Hundreds of flights have been canceled since the fog rolled in Tuesday, affecting an estimated 40,000 people. On 
Friday, the busiest day of the holiday season, 150,000 were estimated to be passing through the airport, about 
50,000 fewer travelers than might otherwise have been expected.
Relief in sight for thousands of stranded holiday travelers at London's Heathrow airport
Heathrow's second-busiest airline, bmi, said Friday it expected half of its scheduled flights to be canceled. No-frills 
airline Ryanair canceled 16 flights.
BAA said it was providing a range of amenities for stranded passengers, including heated tents outside terminals 
with blankets, ponchos, sleeping mats, children's packs and food and drink. In one tent, a brass band played 
Christmas carols.
With Heathrow hotels full, some people slept in chilly terminals overnight while waiting to rebook a flight home.
"I knew that there was going to be trouble, but I've never seen anything quite like this," said Jon Davidson, 22, a 
student from Austin, Texas, waiting on Friday for a flight to Amsterdam.
Bob Ostreck, 33, waiting for a flight to Paris for a second day, said he had been unable to book a train ticket. "We're 
so close, I hope we don't miss Christmas," he said.
Virgin Trains, which provides services between London and Scotland, said it added an extra 4,800 seats due to 
"record-breaking demand." Eurostar, operating trains from London to Paris and Brussels, reported a 15-percent 
spike in traffic and said all seats Friday had been booked.

The lad doth protest too much methinks. The European competition authorities' decision to refer Ryanair's Euros 
1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) hostile bid for Aer Lingus for in-depth investigation has sparked the usual storm of protest from 
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's combative boss.
In fact, Mr O'Leary is sitting rather pretty. The Competition Commission's investigation must end by May 11. If it 
approves the deal, Ryanair can then, with the agreement of the Irish Takeover Panel, relaunch its bid.
Alternatively it may not be able to agree with the Commission on the remedies necessary to get the bid through, or 
the bid may be refused approval. In this case, Ryanair can sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, on which it has 
currently made a tidy paper profit. Or it could simply remain as a large shareholder in Aer Lingus, in effect blocking 
other bids and acting as a permanent thorn in the side of its management and the Irish government.
Ryanair shareholders may feel this is an inappropriate use of their money. After all, they presumably bought shares 
in Ryanair expecting it to concentrate on its high-growth, low-cost model - rather than diversifying into Aer Lingus.
Given the 17 per cent increase in Ryanair's shares since the Aer Lingus bid was launched, sympathy for 
shareholders seems misplaced. Better to save it for Aer Lingus's management, which is now under pressure from 
all directions. Dermot Mannion, its chief executive, must deliver on a demanding business plan, whilst dealing with 
even more demanding unions. Aer Lingus stock will be highly illiquid - between them, the government, employees 
and Ryanair hold about 70 per cent.
Investors will, with justification, want to see a share price well north of Ryanair's Euros 2.80 offer, since Mr Mannion 
rejected it with such conviction. All in all, it would not be surprising if Mr O'Leary does not have to wait too long in 
the wings.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it is immediately withdrawing its offer to buy Aer Lingus after EU regulators 
launched a probe into its hostile bid for the Irish carrier.
The no-frills carrier said its 1.48 billion euros ($1.9 billion) offer was now void. It said it would only make another 
offer if the European Commission approved the proposed takeover.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O' Leary accused European Commission competition officials of bias against his 
airline. He noted that the same authority approved a deal between Air France SA and Dutch carrier KLM.
In that transaction, the parties offered to surrender 120 landing slots, O'Leary said. Ryanair offered as part of its bid 
to surrender more than 500 slots including slots currently belonging to Aer Lingus Group PLC, he said.
"The commission appears to apply different and totally inconsistent principles to the Ryanair-Aer Lingus deal than it 
applied to the much larger Air France-KLM deal, which was waved through with little difficulty," O' Leary said.
Ryanair insisted that under European Union competition rules, it could no longer continue with its bid. However, the 
EU executive regularly launches four-month investigations into deals where it sees possible problems and a 
decision to do so does not require the bidding company to withdraw its bid during the investigation.
The European Commission said earlier Thursday that it saw "serious competition concerns" with the proposed deal 
to combine Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and lead to higher fares.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus have no other rivals on most routes out of Dublin and it was likely that the EU would have 
asked for more concessions before it could approve the combination. Regulators said solutions put forward by 
Ryanair in recent weeks did not go far enough to clear doubts about the deal.
Ryanair had put forward two plans to calm regulators' fears, but the commission said the first was "not sufficient" to 
remove its serious doubts while the second was handed in too close to the deadline to be properly assessed.
O'Leary stressed Ryanair would publish a new bid as soon as regulators permitted it.
Ryanair withdraws bid to buy Aer Lingus
"Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus," he said.
O'Leary declined to say whether Ryanair would increase its offer from the current bid price of 2.80 euros ($3.70).
Ryanair's bid already looked troubled, however. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, 
fiercely oppose the deal. Ryanair's offer has so far won over less than 1 percent of shareholders and it has so far 
failed to build its 25-percent stake into the controlling share it needs.
Ryanair has run into trouble with regulators before and was ordered to pay back millions of euros in subsidies it 
received from the Belgian regional government of Wallonia to help run flights out of Charleroi. However, Ryanair 
has also made similar complaints about unfair state subsidies given to Air France.
Ryanair stunned Ireland Oct. 5 when it launched its surprise bid, barely a week after the Irish government had 
floated most of its holding on the Irish and British stock exchanges at a share price of 2.20 euros ($2.85). At the 
time, Ryanair said it had bought 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares, but was legally restricted from buying more 
once the takeover plan sent Aer Lingus shares soaring above its bid price.
Analysts and investors almost universally viewed the current bid as doomed to fail. Analysts believe to be 
successful Ryanair will have to raise its bid above 2.80 euros ($3.70).
Growing rapidly from its Irish base, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading low-frills cheap flights 
that forced Aer Lingus to do the same.

Highlight: AIB and Bank of Ireland led the ISEQ to a fresh record closing high tonight.
Body
Shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland closed sharply higher this evening, leading the ISEQ to a fresh record closing 
high.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 18.07 points higher at 9317.48 having been as high as 9325.88 earlier in the 
session - a new trading record.
The gains came ahead of tomorrow's half day on the Irish Stock Exchange, with markets closing for Christmas at 
13.15. Trading will re-commence on Wednesday 27 December.
 AIB led the way, up 29c to 23.00, while Bank of Ireland also made decent headway, jumping 17c to 17.27. 
Elsewhere in the banking sector shares were mixed, with Anglo Irish Bank down 1c to 15.42 and Irish Life and 
Permanent down 5c to 21.00. Shares in Ryanair closed 2c higher at 10.10 following the European Commission's 
predictable decision to launch an in-depth probe into its takeover bid for Aer Lingus. Brussels said it is concerned 
about the implications of having only one Irish airline instead of two. The decision forced Ryanair to allow its E2.80 
per share bid to lapse. Despite the setback, the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said: "Ryanair remains 
committed to acquiring Aer Lingus and will continue this process - to what we believe will be - the successful 
conclusion of the Phase 2 investigation". The EC ruling is not expected until March at the earliest. Meanwhile, 
shares in Aer Lingus closed flat on 2.73 after the airline announced earlier this week that it is to commence direct 
scheduled flights to Lithuania for the first time with three flights a week from Dublin to Vilnius starting in May 2007. 
CRH turned lower in late afternoon trading despite announcing plans to invest E200m in modernising its Platin 
Works plant near Drogheda, through its Irish Cement division. It said this will increase the plant's capacity from two 
million tonnes to 2.8 million. Shares ended the day 5c lower at 30.90. Grafton turned in a positive performance, up 
20c to 12.37, after it said on Wednesday that earnings for the full year are "set to come in on target". The building 
materials and DIY group said its underlying sales in Ireland grew by a high digit percentage, while growth was in the 
low single digits in the UK. The firm also announced it had made 16 acquisitions in the UK this year at a total cost of 
AIB & BoI lead ISEQ to record close
about E80m. It added that it had also continued to sell off some of its property in the second half of the year and 
would make profits of around E33m from these deals in 2006. Shares in recently launched fencing and scaffolding 
firm Siteserv ended the day unchanged on 1.09 after it announced the purchase of formwork and scaffolding 
provider Easy Access for E20m - E17m in cash, the rest in shares. Easy Access operates from sites at Clondalkin 
in Dublin, Tuam in Galway and Glanmire in Cork. In the year to the end of February, it had turnover of E16.5m and 
earnings before interest and tax of E4.3m. CandC led the fallers, down 24c to 13.26, while Elan lost 25c to end the 
day at 10.45. Paddy Power closed 10c lower on 15.40.

Shares on the Dublin market edged higher today having closed at fresh record highs last night.
Just before 1300, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 19.77 points to 9319.18, having hit a new all time trading 
high of 9321.97 earlier in the session.
Leading the way today was no frill airline Ryanair after its takeover bid for Aer Lingus collapsed on Wednesday 
following the EU decision to launch a four month, in depth probe into the takeover. Despite the setback, the airline's 
chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said that "Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus and will continue 
this process - to what we believe will be - the successful conclusion of the Phase 2 investigation". Shares in Ryanair 
jumped 12c to 10.20 today, while Aer Lingus lost 1c to trade at 2.72.
 Shares in CRH added on a modest 4c to 30.99 after the building materials group said that its Irish subsidiary, Irish 
Cement, is beginning a E200m investment project to modernise its Platin Cement Works near Drogheda. 
Elsewhere in the building sector, shares in Grafton were up 21c to 12.38 after it said on Wednesday that earnings 
for the full year are "set to come in on target". The building materials and DIY group said its underlying sales in 
Ireland grew by a high digit percentage, while growth was in the low single digits in the UK. The firm also 
announced it had made 16 acquisitions in the UK this year at a total cost of about E80m. It added that it had also 
continued to sell off some of its property in the second half of the year and would make profits of around E33m from 
these deals in 2006. Kingspan was down 3c to 19.54, while McInerney added on 10c to 14.50. Other notable 
movers today included AIB, up 4c to 22.75, Anglo Irish Bank, down 3c to 15.40, Bank of Ireland, up 15c to 17.25, 
and Irish Life and Permanent, down 5c to 21.00.

Body
The European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA) today welcomed the decision to include airlines in the EU 
Emissions Trading Scheme announced by the European Commission.
However, it expressed disappointed at the decision to delay inclusion of all flights arriving and departing EU 
airports, as proposed in the initial draft of the proposed legislation.
It said the decision to limit the scope of the scheme initially to intra-EU flights only will capture only 20pc of EU 
aviation carbon emissions, or approximately 0.5pc of overall EU emissions.
 "It cannot be right to press ahead with a quick political fix which results in capturing only a tiny proportion of 
emissions," the association said. "It is unfair and discriminatory that long haul airlines, who are the biggest polluters, 
would not have to pay the cost of their emissions. There is also a serious risk that the delay in incorporating long 
haul traffic would become intractable and we would end up with an intra-EU only scheme. This would be a 
ridiculous result." The association said it will be calling on the European Parliament to ensure that all flights into and 
out of Europe are covered by the scheme at the same time. ELFAA airline members include EasyJet, Flybe, 
Hapag-Lloyd Express, My Way Airlines, Norwegian, Ryanair, Sky Europe, Sterling, Sverige Flyg, Transavia.com 
and Wizz Air.

Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 999m)hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus lapsed last night in the face of serious 
misgivings expressed by the European competition authorities, which announced the start of an in-depth 
investigation into the offer.
The low-cost carrier, said, however, that it remained "committed to acquiring Aer Lingus". It intended to make a 
further offer in the event of the deal eventually being cleared by the European Commission. Under Irish Takeover 
Panel rules,Ryanair can apply for permission to mount a new bid within 21 days of a final clearance by the 
Commission.
The launch of the in-depth investigation by European competition regulators into the bid will prolong the legal 
uncertainty surrounding the deal by another four to five months. The European Commission said it needed more 
time to examine the trans-action's likely impact oncompetition.
The combination of Europe's biggest no-frills airline and Ireland's flagship carrier raised "serious competition 
concerns in the passenger air transport sector and, in particular, could reduce choice for consumers and could give 
rise to higher fares than would be likely if the two carriers remained separate," it said.
Brussels will have an additional 90 working days until May 11 to scrutinise the deal. The Commission stressed that 
the opening of an in-depth probe did not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.
Last night, Ryanair attacked the decision by Brussels and said it flew in the face of the Commission's stated policy 
of encouraging consolidation among European airlines.

Ryanair has ended its hostile takeover plans for Aer Lingus after negative comments from the EU.
The airline last night said "all acceptances of the offer received to date are void", but it said that if the commission 
cleared the deal after its phase two investigation, it "intends to make a further offer for Aer Lingus". To make a 
second offer, it will need the consent of the Takeover Panel.
The European Commission has said Ryanair's proposed E1.4 billion take-over of Aer Lingus would raise serious 
competition concerns and could reduce choice for consumers and increase fares.
 The EC has now opened a Phase 2 inquiry, which will give the Commission 90 days to decide if the take-over 
would significantly impede competition within the European Economic Area. 'My main priority on this case is to 
make sure that consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of airline services,' said Competition 
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

 The Commission said the proposed merger could lead to the elimination of competition between the carriers on a 
large number of routes out of Ireland as well as eliminate competition at Dublin airport. Ryanair said following the 
decision of the European Commission to refer the acquisition to Phase II, Ryanair's offer lapses, in accordance with 
the requirements of the take-over rules, and it intends to make a further offer for Aer Lingus. Ryanair had just two 
days to secure acceptances from Aer Lingus shareholders before the bid was due to lapse on Friday.

Corp.'s second-quarter profit gain of 9 percent was overshadowed 
Wednesday by the outlook for the third quarter. After reporting a strong 
second quarter that exceeded analyst expectations, the company said it 
expected lower third-quarter earnings than last year, largely due to a 
sluggish U.S. economy and fuel bills.

The package shipper's third-quarter forecast was below Wall Street predictions. Shares tumbled almost 2 percent, 
down $2.15, to close at $111.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.
While predicting lower third-quarter earnings than for the same period year, FedEx is looking for a stronger than 
expected fourth period.
In a conference call with analysts, FedEx founder and chief executive Frederick W. Smith said FedEx expects 
"steady performance" for the fiscal year ending May 31 largely because of a "healthy global economy led by 
continued strong growth in Asia."
WASHINGTON (AP) A sharply divided Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 along partisan lines 
Wednesday to impose new measures meant to ensure that local governments do not block new competitors from 
entering the cable television market.
The vote came on the same day that FCC Chairman Kevin Martin released a report on cable prices that shows in 
2004, average cable rates rose 5.2 percent. The report also shows that from 1995 to 2005 rates increased a total of 
93 percent.
The new rules approved by the commission will require local cable franchising authorities to act on applications 
from competitors with access to local rights of way within 90 days, and to act within six months on applications from 
other new competitors.
The FCC will also ban local governments from forcing new competitors to build out new systems more quickly than 
the incumbent carrier and to count certain costs required of new carriers to go toward the 5 percent franchise fee 
they are required to pay.

ATLANTA (AP) The unsecured creditors committee in Delta Air Lines' bankruptcy case, which holds a key role in 
deciding the carrier's fate, said Wednesday it supports Delta's decision to file its stand-alone reorganization plan, 
but that it also will weigh alternatives.
The committee had been largely silent since US Airways' unsolicited $8.4 billion bid for Delta that was disclosed on 
Nov. 15.
"A number of issues, including those left open in the plan of reorganization, will be the focus of continuing 
discussions between the committee and Delta over the coming weeks," the committee said in a statement. "At the 
same time, the committee will continue to consider potential alternatives in order to maximize the ultimate 
recoveries for the unsecured creditors in the Delta bankruptcy."
The committee did not elaborate on its views, and a lawyer for the committee, Daniel Golden, did not return 
repeated calls and e-mails seeking comment.
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) LM Ericsson's plan to buy Redback Networks Inc. for $2.1 billion is a sign of how the 
popularity of Internet video is expected to drive demand for broadband network upgrades.
Analysts said Wednesday the acquisition also plugs a key hole in Ericsson's product line as the company girds itself 
for an increasingly fierce battle with rivals Cisco Systems Inc., Alcatel-Lucent and Juniper Networks Inc.
Network equipment makers are locked in a tooth-and-nail fight to provide the gear that enables service providers to 
offer greater bandwidth on their networks and faster and cheaper downloads of data, voice and video products.
One key area of growth is expected to be IPTV, or Internet Protocol television, a form of digital television typically 
delivered over broadband. Such connections also support high-speed Web surfing and telephone service.
DUBLIN (AP) Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday that it is immediately withdrawing its offer to buy Aer Lingus 
after EU regulators launched a probe into its hostile bid for the Irish carrier.
The no-frills carrier said the offer was now void. It said it would only make another offer if the European Commission 
approved the proposed takeover.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O' Leary accused European Commission competition chiefs of bias against the 
carrier. He noted that the same authority approved a merger between Air France and Dutch airline KLM.
In that merger, the parties offered to surrender 120 flight slots, O'Leary said. Ryanair offered as part of its bid to 
surrender more than 500 slots including slots currently belonging to Aer Lingus PLC, he said.
NEW YORK (AP) John Mack's record for the biggest bonus ever paid to a Wall Street CEO didn't last even a week. 
It was smashed by the $53.4 million that Goldman Sachs gave its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein.
The bonanza for Blankfein included a cash bonus of $27.3 million, with the rest paid in stock and options. He took 
the helm of the investment bank in June after President Bush nominated Henry Paulson to be Treasury secretary.
The record payday, disclosed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on Tuesday, breaks the one set just last Thursday when Morgan Stanley disclosed that it paid CEO 
Mack $40 million in stock and options. Mack, who is 62, rejoined Morgan Stanley 18 months ago to turn around the 
company after the ouster of Philip Purcell. Mack's short-lived record bested one set in 2005 by Goldman's Paulson, 
who was given $38.3 million.
Other than Blankfein, 11 other senior Goldman executives as a group were granted slightly more than $150 million 
in shares and stock options. The highest paid among those were Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried, who both hold the 
titles of president and chief operating officer. They each received $25.6 million in shares and options in 2006.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) Aramark Corp., the nation's largest foodservice company, will be taken private for the second 
time in 22 years after shareholders on Wednesday approved a $6.3 billion leveraged buyout bid.
It will also be the second time long-running Chief Executive Joseph Neubauer leads an investment group to take 
Aramark private. The first was in 1984, to thwart a hostile takeover from corporate raiders. The company went 
public again in 2001.
More than 95 percent of 375 million votes cast at the meeting approved of the bid, the company said.
Neubauer's group which includes the private equity units of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan plus the private 
investment firm Thomas H. Lee Partners offered to buy the company in August for $33.80 per share in cash.
The group will also assume $2 billion of debt in the deal.
PARIS (AP) Publicis Groupe SA, a global advertising agency, said Wednesday it will buy U.S. digital marketing 
company Digitas Inc. for about $1.3 billion in cash.
The announcement underlines the growing importance of the Internet in advertising and marketing campaigns as 
advertisers seek to respond to changing consumer patterns.
Paris-based Publicis said it will pay $13.50 per share of Digitas, which is based in Boston. That represents a 23.5 
percent premium to Tuesday's closing price and a premium of 29.1 percent to the company's average price over the 
past three months, Publicis said.
It said the deal has the approval of both companies' boards and is expected to close in February.

European Union regulators are taking a more intensive look at the possible competitive consequences of Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's unsolicited $1.9 billion bid for Irish carrier Aer Lingus PLC, delaying any deal by months.
The European Commission said Wednesday it saw "serious competition concerns" with the proposed deal to 
combine Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and raise fares.
It has until May 11 to decide whether to approve the deal or block it.
Ryanair's bid already looks troubled, however, as it seeks to build on its 25 percent stake. The Irish government, 
which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, is fiercely opposed and less 1 percent of Aer Lingus 
shareholders have so far accepted the offer. Investors opposed to a buyout control more than 46 percent of shares.
But Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told shareholders last week that his company remained the only logical buyer for 
Aer Lingus despite growing scepticism from analysts and executives and shareholders of his own airline.
"Let's face it, nobody else is interested in acquiring Aer Lingus," he told a meeting in Dublin on Dec. 14.
Growing rapidly from its Irish base, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading low-frills cheap flights 
that forced Aer Lingus to do the same.
EU officials said the two airlines overlap on a large number of European routes and are each other's closest 
competitors for services out of Ireland.
The combination "could lead to the elimination of actual and potential competition" on many routes and eliminate 
rivalry for services at Dublin airport, the Commission said.
"My main priority on this case is to make sure that consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of 
airline services," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
European Union launches more detailed probe into Ryanair's hostile bid for Aer Lingus
Ireland has few passenger ferry links to Britain and Continental Europe. The Irish government has also stressed its 
worries that the deal might be bad for customers.
Ryanair put forward two plans to calm regulators' fears, but the Commission said the first was "not sufficient" to 
remove its serious doubts while the second was handed in too close to the deadline to be properly assessed.
The Commission can demand companies sell off units or change the way they do business before it grants the 
approval need to close the deal.
It could force the airlines to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Dublin hub. Regulators demanded that Air 
France SA and the Netherlands' KLM give up slots at their home airports of Paris and Amsterdam when they 
merged in 2004. Lufthansa AG and Swiss also had to make similar concessions last year.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it is immediately withdrawing its offer to buy Aer Lingus after EU regulators 
launched a probe into its hostile bid for the Irish carrier.
The no-frills carrier said its €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) offer was now void. It said it would only make another offer 
if the European Commission approved the proposed takeover.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O' Leary accused European Commission competition officials of bias against his 
airline. He noted that the same authority approved a deal between Air France SA and Dutch carrier KLM.
In that transaction, the parties offered to surrender 120 landing slots, O'Leary said. Ryanair offered as part of its bid 
to surrender more than 500 slots including slots currently belonging to Aer Lingus Group PLC, he said.
"The commission appears to apply different and totally inconsistent principles to the Ryanair-Aer Lingus deal than it 
applied to the much larger Air France-KLM deal, which was waved through with little difficulty," O' Leary said.
Ryanair insisted that under European Union competition rules, it could no longer continue with its bid. However, the 
EU executive regularly launches four-month investigations into deals where it sees possible problems and a 
decision to do so does not require the bidding company to withdraw its bid during the investigation.
The European Commission said earlier Thursday that it saw "serious competition concerns" with the proposed deal 
to combine Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and lead to higher fares.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus have no other rivals on most routes out of Dublin and it was likely that the EU would have 
asked for more concessions before it could approve the combination. Regulators said solutions put forward by 
Ryanair in recent weeks did not go far enough to clear doubts about the deal.
Ryanair had put forward two plans to calm regulators' fears, but the commission said the first was "not sufficient" to 
remove its serious doubts while the second was handed in too close to the deadline to be properly assessed.
O'Leary stressed Ryanair would publish a new bid as soon as regulators permitted it.
Ryanair withdraws bid to buy Aer Lingus
"Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus," he said.
O'Leary declined to say whether Ryanair would increase its offer from the current bid price of €2.80 (US$3.70).
Ryanair's bid already looked troubled, however. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, 
fiercely oppose the deal. Ryanair's offer has so far won over less than 1 percent of shareholders and it has so far 
failed to build its 25-percent stake into the controlling share it needs.
Ryanair has run into trouble with regulators before and was ordered to pay back millions of euros in subsidies it 
received from the Belgian regional government of Wallonia to help run flights out of Charleroi. However, Ryanair 
has also made similar complaints about unfair state subsidies given to Air France.
Ryanair stunned Ireland Oct. 5 when it launched its surprise bid, barely a week after the Irish government had 
floated most of its holding on the Irish and British stock exchanges at a share price of €2.20 (US$2.85). At the time, 
Ryanair said it had bought 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares, but was legally restricted from buying more once the 
takeover plan sent Aer Lingus shares soaring above its bid price.
Analysts and investors almost universally viewed the current bid as doomed to fail. Analysts believe to be 
successful Ryanair will have to raise its bid above €2.80 (US$3.70).
Growing rapidly from its Irish base, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading low-frills cheap flights 
that forced Aer Lingus to do the same.

It has until May 11 to decide whether it can approve the deal or block it.
Ryanair's bid already looks troubled, however. The Irish government, which owns a quarter of the country's national

Ireland has few commercial ferry links to Britain and Continental Europe. The Irish government has also stressed its 
worries that the deal might be bad for customers.
Ryanair put forward two plans to calm regulators' fears, but the Commission said the first was "not sufficient" to 
remove its serious doubts while the second was handed in too close to the deadline to be properly assessed.

European Union regulators are taking a more intensive look at the possible competitive consequences of Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's unsolicited $1.9 billion bid for Irish carrier Aer Lingus PLC, delaying any deal by months.
The European Commission said Wednesday it saw "serious competition concerns" with the proposed deal to 
combine Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and raise fares.
It has until May 11 to decide whether to approve the deal or block it.
Ryanair's bid already looks troubled, however, as it seeks to build on its 25 percent stake. The Irish government, 
which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, is fiercely opposed and less 1 percent of Aer Lingus 
shareholders have so far accepted the offer. Investors opposed to a buyout control more than 46 percent of shares.
But Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told shareholders last week that his company remained the only logical buyer for 
Aer Lingus despite growing scepticism from analysts and executives and shareholders of his own airline.
"Let's face it, nobody else is interested in acquiring Aer Lingus," he told a meeting in Dublin on Dec. 14.
Growing rapidly from its Irish base, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading low-frills cheap flights 
that forced Aer Lingus to do the same.
EU officials said the two airlines overlap on a large number of European routes and are each other's closest 
competitors for services out of Ireland.
The combination "could lead to the elimination of actual and potential competition" on many routes and eliminate 
rivalry for services at Dublin airport, the Commission said.
"My main priority on this case is to make sure that consumers would continue to enjoy a competitive choice of 
airline services," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Ryanair put forward two plans to calm regulators' fears, but the Commission said the first was "not sufficient" to 
remove its serious doubts while the second was handed in too close to the deadline to be properly assessed.
The Commission can demand companies sell off units or change the way they do business before it grants the 
approval need to close the deal.
It could force the airlines to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Dublin hub. Regulators demanded that Air 
France SA and the Netherlands' KLM give up slots at their home airports of Paris and Amsterdam when they 
merged in 2004. Lufthansa AG and Swiss also had to make similar concessions last year.

Banks led the Dublin market to fresh record highs this morning as the recent flood of positive trading updates from 
major Irish companies continued.
Just after midday the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 65.35 points to 9277.84, having hit 9286.29 earlier in the 
session.
Grafton was the latest company to issue a trading update today. It said that earnings for the full year are likely to be 
in-line with expectations. In a trading statement released this morning the group that operates the Woodies chain 
said it has spent E80 million this year on 16 acquisitions in the UK. This has added 27 new branches to its network 
in the UK bringing its annualised turnover to over E120 million. Sales growth in the UK was in "low single-digits", it 
said. Shares in Grafton fell 2c to 12.13 in Dublin.
 The recent strong performance of financial shares continued today, with Irish Life and Permanent leading the way, 
up 35c to 21.00. AIB also made steady progress, up 15c to 22.60, while Bank of Ireland added on 13c to 17.13 and 
Anglo Irish Bank jumped 8c to 15.43. Other notable movers included no frills airline Ryanair, up 15c to 10.20, as it 
awaits the outcome of the EU probe into whether to block its bid for Aer Lingus. Although the bid is likely to fail 
regardless of today's decision, a verdict in favour of Ryanair would allow it to bid again for the flag carrier next year. 
Shares in Aer Lingus were unchanged at 2.75. CRH was a modest mover, up 33c to 30.93, while McInerney lost 5c 
to 14.30.

The European Commission will today rule on the legality of Ryanair's takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
The Commission's merger task force can either clear or reject the bid, or begin a Phase 2 investigation which will 
give the Commission four months to consider the bid in more detail.
It has been considering whether the proposed deal would affect competition in the air travel market, particularly on 
the Dublin to London route.
 Even if it does clear the bid, the takeover is very unlikely to be successful as Michael O'Leary's airline only has until 
Friday to secure acceptances from Aer Lingus shareholders. However, a positive ruling will clear the way for 
Ryanair to make a fresh bid next year. Brussels was originally due to give its verdict at the end of last month, 
however, the deadline was extended until today because Ryanair proposed a number of remedies to resolve 
possible competition issues.

Just before 1100, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 44.56 points to 9173.15.
Anglo Irish Bank and AIB led the fallers, down 12c to 15.40 and 11c to 22.39, despite both being named by 
Goodbody as companies to invest in next year. In its Irish equity outlook for 2007, the stockbroker handpicked the 
10 stocks investors should be looking at for next year.
 It says Anglo will show 21pc growth in earnings per share over the next two years, while earnings growth at AIB is 
likely to outpace the banking sector over the next two years, and the ongoing success of the Irish economy will 
support its growth. Goodbody also predicted that Grafton will grow EPS of 11pc next year. Shares in the firm were

China may have driven down prices the world over for everything from toys to televisions, but officials are calling 
foul over "China price" airline tickets.
Spring Airlines, which launched a service a year and a half ago as the country's first budget carrier using the 
business model of airlines such as Ryanair, the no-frills carrier, offered tickets starting at Rmb1 when it began a 
daily midnight service between the eastern city of Jinan and its base in Shanghai three weeks ago.
This drew the ire of the Jinan Municipal Price Bureau, which has announced its intention to fine Spring Rmb150,000 
(Dollars 19,000) for breaking a regulation limiting fare discounts to 45 per cent of the base fare, in this case 
Rmb760.
The proposed fine highlights the difficulties faced by China's infant low-cost carriers in what is a tightly regulated 
aviation market. "The government determines the degree of float allowed in air ticket prices," a Price Bureau official 
said yesterday.
Spring is appealing against the proposed fine. The airline, one of a number launched following recent limited 
liberalisation of the aviation sector, accepts that it violated price controls, but says the 45 per cent limit is frequently 
breached during the quiet season and that its pricing benefits society.
Zhang Lei, spokesman for Spring, said the cut-price tickets had helped reduce the airline's losses on unpopular 
late-night flights since passengers had to pay a fuel surcharge and airport tax that brought the true price of their 
ticket to Rmb151.
The dispute over the cut-price flights could become a test of the government's willingness to ease controls on the 
domestic aviation market. Such rules are intended in part to help ensure the profitability of the dominant state-
owned but internationally listed carriers Air China, China Eastern and China Southern.
Spring 's prices 'too low' AVIATION
Spring said it was caught in an "extremely difficult" position between the need to obey rules created under China's 
planned economy and a desire to fully participate in market competition.
Analysts say tight government regulation of fares, sales and distribution networks, and aircraft purchasing are 
limiting the development of China's budget carriers, which need high passenger volumes to survive.
Officials of the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China, the industry regulator, were yesterday unavailable 
to comment.

Body
Financial shares were the biggest losers in Dublin today on a day of light trading as investors began to count down 
the days to their Christmas holidays.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 4.59 points lower at 9217.71, with less than 20 million shares changing 
hands.
The slight dip came after the market closed at all time record high on Friday, following a week which saw the 
release of trading updates from several of Ireland's biggest companies.
 Today it was the turn of Kingspan and FBD Holdings to publish their pre-close statements, with both firms 
predicting better than expected results for the full year. Insurance group FBD is predicting operating earnings per 
share to be 348 cents, while building materials group Kingspan said its operating profit should grow by around 33pc 
this year on the back of a strong performance in its insulated panels business. Shares in FBD fell 90c on the news 
to 42.50, with Kingspan up 14c to 19.30. The negative close in Dublin came despite a strong start in the U.S. where 
Wall Street extended its recent record breaking run. This was fuelled by a flurry of takeovers with casino group 
Harrah's Entertainment reportedly close to a private equity buyout. Banking giant Citigroup also added to the 
buoyant mood after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral', citing an attractive valuation and 
optimism over its 2007 earnings outlook. Back in Dublin, shares in AIB were a notable faller, down 20c to 22.50, on 
profit taking after shares in Ireland's biggest bank soared more than 3pc on Friday. The gains came after AIB 
recently announced that profits for the full year are likely to be up by over 20pc. Elsewhere in the financial sector, 
Anglo Irish Bank closed 3c higher at 15.55 after it announced record profits for the full year earlier this month. Bank 
of Ireland was unchanged on 17.16, while Irish Life and Permanent fell 10c to 20.90. Ryanair was a notable gainer, 
up 9c to 10.04, while its takeover target Aer Lingus closed flat on 2.75. Shares in the Kerry Group jumped 10c to 
18.80 despite negative comments from a major analyst. Global finance house ABN Amro had advised investors to 
sell their shares in the company on the grounds that earnings will be hurt by slow growth, continuing dollar pressure 
ISEQ down 4 points as banks weigh heavy
and margin pressure. In an extensive note on the group, ABN Amro analyst, Liz Hartley, predicted that, due to 
restructuring, up to 2.6pc could be knocked off projected earnings for 2008. She said that figure could rise to 5.6pc 
if further restructuring is undertaken to ship the group into shape. She said the group's plans to close 10 plants in 
seven countries across its consumer and ingredients business would result in a dip in sales of E250m. Shares in 
Kerry, before today, had fallen by E1.40 since November 22, wiping a total of E240m off the value of the company. 
Other notable movers included Paddy Power, up 26c to 14.96, Siteserv, down 3c to 1.08, and CPL Resources, up 
22c to 5.65.

Low-cost airlines step up French dispute
Low-cost airlines step up French dispute

Low-cost airlines are stepping up their fight against the French government as Paris tries to force EasyJet and 
Ryanair to move the staff they employ on French soil from British employment contracts to more expensive French 
ones.
The airlines are resisting the switch, which would force them to pay higher social security charges on their 
employees and improve their channels of employee and union representation.
The dispute is part of the French government's efforts to prevent low-cost carriers gaining an unfair advantage over 
Air France-KLM, the partially state-owned nation-al flag carrier. But the low-cost airlines suspect Paris of trying to 
protect its domestic market from foreign rivals.
EasyJet has been charged with "concealed work" and "impeding staff representation bodies" after the UK-based 
company's offices in Paris's Orly airport, where it employs 170 staff, were raided last week by French gendarmes, 
social security inspectors and tax officials.
Ryanair, the Irish company, could face similar charges over the operations it opened this year in Marseilles, where it 
employs about 60 people. The airline is thought to have appealed to the European Commission against the order to 
switch to French contracts.
French officials say that under a new decree, published in November, airlines with a permanent presence in France 
must register as French companies and give staff local contracts.
However, this is rejected by EasyJet, part of the Easy group of companies owned by entrepreneur Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, who lives in Monaco. The company argues that its pilots and cabin crew do not work in France but on its 
aircraft which fly under a British flag, while its ground staff are all subcontractors.
Low-cost airlines step up French dispute
The two low-cost companies have been waging a long-standing campaign to break into the French market. Ryanair 
this year lodged a complaint with the Brussels-based Commission over the Euros 1bn (Pounds 670m) of state aid it 
claimed Air France had received since 1993.
EasyJet has been tussling with the French authorities to gain more of the take-off and landing slots at Paris Orly 
airport. It is pursuing a court case against Cohor, the French slot co-ordinator, alleging that it is notindependent of 
the French state and is biased towards Air France.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary today made a final plea to Aer Lingus shareholders to accept Ryanair's 
E2.80 a share offer for the airline.
He makes the plea in a letter posted to Aer Lingus shareholders today, the second he has sent.
Mr O'Leary says it is a response to an Aer Lingus circular to shareholders that "completely fails to address the 
significant issues which Ryanair has raised".
 He also states that Ryanair will not be raising its bid which values Aer Lingus at E1.48bn. Ryanair says that the 
circular from Aer Lingus fails to address its "dismal H1 2006 performance, the apparent inability of management to 
tackle costs or outline any realistic prospects Aer Lingus has for enhancing shareholder value as an independent 
company". "Aer Lingus' Second Circular claims that the Ryanair Offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus. If this is 
the case, shareholders can only wonder why the Board and management sold the company at E2.20 per share just 
8 days prior to the Ryanair Offer," the latter says. "Ryanair believes that the Aer Lingus Board may have misled the 
selling shareholder and ultimately the people of Ireland by agreeing to a price of E2.20 at the IPO. Alternatively, 
they may be misleading shareholders now in recommending you reject the Ryanair Offer of E2.80 because it 
"significantly undervalues Aer Lingus." The letter urges Aer Lingus shareholders to accept the cash offer by 1pm on 
December 22.

Shares in leading European budget airline Ryanair rose Thursday after CEO Michael O'Leary told shareholders that 
it remained the only logical buyer for rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus.
Ryanair shares rose €0.35 ($0US.46), or 3.6 percent, to €9.95 ($13US.09) after O'Leary told an extraordinary 
general meeting of shareholders that Ryanair was aiming to double its passenger load and profits by 2012 and was 
still determined to acquire the formerly state-controlled Aer Lingus as part of its strategy.
"Let's face it, nobody else is interested in acquiring Aer Lingus," O'Leary told the meeting at a hotel near Dublin 
airport, the headquarters for both Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
Ryanair said more than 99 percent of its shareholders attending the meeting voted in favor of the takeover bid, 
which Ryanair launched Oct. 5 barely a week after the Irish government launched an IPO comprising most of its 
stake in Aer Lingus.
O'Leary also boosted Ryanair shares by pledging that his airline, which normally does not pay dividends to 
shareholders, would make an exceptional payout by the end of 2007, possibly in the form of a share buyback.
O'Leary said Ryanair also had signed delivery contracts to hedge 18 percent of its aviation fuel costs for the 
January-March quarter. He did not disclose the price agreed.
Analysts and Ryanair chiefs themselves agree that the Aer Lingus takeover bid appears unlikely to succeed 
because more than 46 percent of Aer Lingus shareholders led by the government and investment funds 
representing Aer Lingus employees are openly opposed to it.
But Ryanair last week extended to Dec. 22 its deadline for shareholders to accept its offer of €2.80 ($3US.68) a 
share. The offer is dependent on Ryanair, which currently holds 25.2 percent of Aer Lingus, acquiring at least 50 
percent. O'Leary said the prospect of a Ryanair takeover in the short term was "unlikely but not impossible."

Body
Shares on the Dublin market sailed past the 9000 level today to a fresh closing high following the release of several 
positive trading updates.
The ISEQ shot ahead after Irish Continental Group said it now expects its underlying pre-tax profits for the full year 
to come in ahead of expectations. It said this was the result better than expected trading over recent months. The 
Irish Ferries owner also announced an extension of its port terminal facility in Dublin. This will increase the capacity 
of its container terminal by almost 50pc. Shares closed 165c higher in Dublin this evening on 14.60.
The news comes at the end of a difficult year for the company. At the turn of the year Irish Continental Group was 
locked in a bitter dispute with trade union SIPTU over the company's plans to outsource jobs and re-flag its ships. 
The dispute sent shares in the company tumbling. In March, the share price was also hit after the group reported a 
pre-tax loss of E14.8m for 2005.
 Today's update helped drag the ISEQ index of Irish shares 134.43 points higher to 9,090.83. Market sentiment was 
also boosted by a positive update from Irish Life and Permanent which said that it expects overall group pre-tax 
operating profit growth for the FY year to exceed 20pc. Shares closed 1.21 points higher at 20.77 in Dublin. 
Elsewhere, shares in AIB were up 25c to 21.95 after it last week predicted strong profits for the full year. Bank of 
Ireland tacked on 6c to 16.75, while Anglo Irish Bank added on 2c to 15.34. A positive start across the Atlantic also 
lent support, with financial stocks leading Wall Street higher. Investors there were also reassured by a sharp fall in 
weekly job claims for a second straight week, pushing total claims down to the lowest level in two months. On the 
corporate front, consensus beating results from financial heavyweight Bear Stearns and robust results at Lehman 
Brothers also helped sentiment. Firming oil prices also lent support, higher as OPEC announced plans to slash 
crude production by 500,000 barrels per day from February next year, pushing New York light sweet crude oil 
prices by USD1.24 to USD63.59 per barrel. Back in Dublin, Ryanair jumped 31c to 9.95 after its shareholders 
backed its bid for Aer Lingus at an Extraordinary General Meeting in Dublin. Shares in Aer Lingus also rose on the

news, up 1c to 2.75. In the construction sector, Kingspan led the way, up 55c to 19.30, while Grafton added 14c to 
11.49. Shares in building materials group CRH tacked on 6c to 29.57, with homebuilder McInerney up 9c to 14.35. 
The positive market sentiment failed to lift shares in Paddy Power, with the bookmaker still suffering from being 
downgraded by Merrion Capital earlier this week. The broker said it had downgraded Paddy Power to "Hold" due to 
difficult market conditions. Other notable movers included business support services group DCC, up 91c to 25.25, 
pharmaceutical group Elan, up 5c to 10.50, and clinical research group ICON, up 35c to 27.60.

Passengers may have been horrified to learn of the traces of polonium 210 found recently on commercial aircraft, 
but many fund managers have viewed airlines as radioactive for years. Plagued by overcapacity and cyclicality, 
they have been the best example of an industry destined to make sub-economic returns.
Might this change? United Airlines and Continental Airlines, America's second and fourth biggest carriers 
respectively, are in merger talks. This follows US Airway's Dollars 8bn hostile bid for Delta and, in Europe, Ryanair's 
tilt at Aer Lingus. In Australia, Macquarie Bank's attempt at a leveraged buy-out of Qantas suggests healthy profits 
are no longer treated as a blip.
The big picture still looks grim. According to the International Air Transport Association, global industry operating 
profits will be Dollars 10bn in 2006, representing a 2 per cent margin and a 4 per cent lease-adjusted post-tax 
return on invested capital (ROIC). Since the start of 2003, industry revenues have risen by Dollars 124bn, or a third, 
but, incredibly, 90 per cent of this boost has been consumed by higher costs, mainly fuel.
If both US deals occurred, returns there would probably leap. The top three carriers' revenue market shares would 
rise from 52 per cent to 73 per cent. Potential synergies from cutting capacity and costs are big, if high risk. US 
Airways, which merged with America West in 2005, thinks a Delta combination would yield, within two years, annual 
benefits equivalent to 6 per cent of combined sales. If a United and Continental deal also achieved this level, the 
overall benefit would be Dollars 3.4bn, taking US 2006 ROIC from 4 per cent to 6 per cent.
Returns in Asia are now close to the cost of capital. In Europe, they are nowhere near it. Carriers must legally retain 
national identities, making it hard to integrate businesses fully. Synergies were only 2 per cent of sales after two 
years at Air France-KLM. An "open skies" agreement, which could change this, looks some way off. Given that the 
economic and aircraft order cycles are near peaks, fund managers should keep their Geiger counters handy.

Shareholders in Ryanair today approved the airline's bid for rival Aer Lingus at an Extraordinary General Meeting in

Ryanair launched the E1.48 billion hostile bid in October two weeks after Aer Lingus floated on the Irish Stock 
Exchange.
Ryanair said that "in excess of 99pc of the votes cast were in favour of the Resolutions approved by Ryanair 
Shareholders".
 At the meeting, shareholders also approved a share split, meaning that each ordinary Ryanair share will be split in 
two. This will happen in the first three months of 2007. The company also confirmed that it had hedged 18pc its fuel 
requirements for Q4 fiscal 2008 ( January to March 2008) at a cost per barrel that represents a 10pc reduction on

Bookmaker Paddy Power weighed heavy on the Dublin market for a second day today after its shares were 
downgraded by a leading broker earlier in the week.
Paddy Power closed 36c lower at 14.99 this evening after its shares were downgraded by Merrion Capital in the 
face of "a more difficult trading environment". The broker downgraded its rating on Paddy Power from "Buy" to 
"Hold" due to shares being "fairly valued". The bookmaker was also removed from the broker's Model Fund, which 
is made up of ten leading stocks that Merrion believes has above average growth prospects. Shares were also 
knocked by a trading update from online gaming operator 32 Red Plc, which said its operating results for the full 
year will be "significantly below current market forecasts" as a result of unfavourable horseracing results in October 
and November.
Paddy Power led a sluggish ISEQ 7.69 points lower to 8.956.40, with the index having hit an all time high of 
8987.49 earlier in the session.
 The slight dip came despite a positive opening on Wall Street after a sharp jump in November retail sales eased 
fears over a slowdown in consumer spending. Retailers in the U.S. saw sales rise by 1pc last month, following three 
straight months of lacklustre performance. The November gain, which was the best showing since a 1.4pc increase 
in July, comes at the start of the key holiday shopping season. Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris also all 
closed higher. Back in Dublin, in the financial sector, shares in AIB, Ireland's biggest bank, enjoyed a positive to the 
day, up 6c to 21.70, while Anglo Irish Bank fell on profit taking after its recent good run, down 8c to 15.32. 
Elsewhere, Irish Life and Permanent slipped 23c to 19.79, with Bank of Ireland making slight progress, up 5c to 
16.65. Shares in Bulmers manufacturer C and C fell 6c to 12.19 following reports that its British cider brand, 
Magners, will not be available in around 2,000 Tesco stores in the UK this Christmas due to a row between the two 
companies over the price of products. The two firms are said to have been unable to agree the purchase price to be

The Competition Commission is expected to begin a detailed investigation into BAA early next year, which could 
lead to the break-up of the airports group, including its London monopoly and dominance in Scotland.
The announcement yesterday of the Office of Fair Trading's intention to refer BAA to a commission inquiry comes 
months after the world's leading airports group passed into non-UK ownership with its Pounds 10.1bn acquisition by 
a consortium led by Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group.
John Fingleton, OFT chief executive, said greater competition could bring significant passenger benefits. "There is 
evidence of poor quality and high charges - BAA's investment plans . . . have raised significant concerns among 
customers."
BAA controls seven airports, which handled 145m passengers in the year to March. Last year it accounted for 63 
per cent of all UK air passengers. It owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, serving London, Glasgow, Edinburgh 
and Aberdeen in Scotland, and Southampton.
It accounted for 92 per cent of passengers using London airports in 2005, and for 86 per cent of passenger volumes 
in Scotland.
The OFT reference is subject to a two-month consultation ending on February 8. Remedies following an 
investigation could include "divestment of airports, airport runways or terminals".
BAA's leading airline customers have been campaigning for a break-up of the London monopoly and have been 
fiercely critical of BAA's rising charges and costly investment plans.
British Airways, the biggest operator at Heathrow, said separate ownership of Heathrow and Stansted would ensure 
decisions on new runways in the south-east did not lie with one company.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the leading airline at Stansted, said: "Heathrow is a shambles, which 
most passengers, if they could, would avoid at all costs. Stansted is an over-specified, gold-plated Taj Mahal." 
Airport operator faces market inquiry AVIATION
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted should be spun out into independent competing airports, where "the market and 
airport users will have more influence".
Andy Harrison, chief executive of EasyJet, which operates at Stansted and Gatwick, said ownership of BAA was not 
the biggest issue. Each airport was a local monopoly that needed "much more stringent price regulation".
BAA denied it had abused its monopoly. Stephen Nelson, chief executive, said "the main issue . . . is a lack of 
terminal and runway capacity in the south-east, which results in delay". He added: "This problem . . . is a result of 
complex planning laws, an antiquated regulatory system and inflexible slot allocation."

City of Derry Airport has been told to reveal its financial arrangements with Ryanair by a tribunal.
The ruling by Britain's Information Tribunal follows a two-year fight by airport owners Derry City Council against a 
Freedom of Information request.
The decision is seen as precedent-setting and could have implications for British public bodies doing business with 
private enterprises.
 Council chiefs refused to hand over details of how much Ryanair was paying for use of the ratepayer- funded 
airport when asked by a journalist in 2005. In February last, the information commissioner ruled the details must be 
disclosed. The council fought the decision, but the Information Tribunal has dismissed the appeal and given the 
council 30 days from yesterday to disclose the deal. It said Freedom of Information Act exemptions claimed by the 
council did not apply and disagreed the local authority would be vulnerable to a claim for breach of confidence. The 
council can appeal the decision to the High Court on a point of law.

Grupo Ferrovial SA's British airports business BAA PLC could be facing a forced break-up after the government 
ordered a full inquiry into its dominance Tuesday, criticizing its services for their poor quality and high charges.
The government's Office of Fair Trading said it plans to ask the Competition Commission to conduct a detailed 
probe into BAA's position in the airport market, particularly its stranglehold in London.
BAA owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports in London, Southampton in southeast England and Edinburgh, 
Glasgow and Aberdeen in Scotland.
The seven airports combined handle 63 percent of travelers to and from Britain, a figure that rises to 86 percent in 
Scotland and to 92 percent in London.
The Office of Fair Trading said that interested parties have until Feb. 8 to comment on its plans to refer the 
investigation to the Competition Commission.
"There is evidence of poor quality and high charges BAA's investment plans, which are of great importance to the 
U.K., have raised significant concerns among its customers," said OFT Chief Executive John Fingleton.
"We believe that the current market structure does not deliver best value for air travelers in the U.K., and that 
greater competition within the industry could bring significant benefits for passengers."
A full review by the antitrust regulator could lead to an order for Ferrovial, which bought the company as part of a 
consortium earlier this year, to sell one or more of its U.K. airports.
BAA said it has not abused its position and that its current structure has benefited both passengers and airlines. It 
blamed delays and congestion at its London airports on a lack of terminal and runway capacity.
U.K. regulator recommends full investigation of BAA 's dominance of airport market
"This problem has not arisen because of BAA's structure, but instead is the result of the U.K.'s complex planning 
laws, an antiquated regulatory system and inflexible slot allocation," said BAA Chief Executive Stephen Nelson. 
"Lack of capacity is a complex issue therefore it would be wrong to jump to quick and simplistic conclusions about 
structure."
The proposal was welcomed by Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, the two major low-cost carriers based in 
Britain.
"Competition works. It leads to more choice and better services for consumers," said Ryanair Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary.
"Heathrow is a shambles, which most passengers if they could, would avoid at all costs," he added. "Equally, 
Stansted where we operate is an over-specified, gold plated Taj Mahal."
O'Leary said that competition between Liverpool and Manchester airports in northern England and between 
Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow Paisley in Scotland had led to reduced charges and improved services.
EasyJet Chief Executive Andy Harrison said that it also welcomed the probe, but said that the operation of BAA's 
London airports as local monopolies with high prices needed to be addressed also.
"Changing the ownership of BAA will not alter this fundamental structural problem," Harrison said.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, has welcomed the pro-consumer decision by the OFT to refer the BAA airport monopoly to 
the Competition Commission.
It has also called on the Competition Commission to recommend the break-up of the BAA monopoly, which the 
airlines says has led to high prices and abject services at London's three main airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted. 
Welcoming this morning's decision, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said, "Ryanair has long called for a 
break-up of the BAA monopoly. Heathrow is a shambles, which most passengers if they could, would avoid at all 
costs. Equally, Stansted where we operate is an over-specified, gold plated Taj Mahal. The present ineffective 
regulatory regime operated by the CAA encourages the BAA monopoly to waste £4bn. building a second runway 
and terminal at Stansted, when these facilities could easily be built for less than one quarter of this figure."
 "The competition between Liverpool and Manchester airports has led to reduced charges and improved services 
for passengers. Equally, in Scotland, the competition between Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow Paisley has led to 
lower charges and choice for consumers. "Competition works. It leads to more choice and better services for 
consumers. We again call for the break up of the BAA monopoly. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted should be spun 
out into separately owned, independent, competing airports, where the market and airport users will have more 
influence over the type of low cost, efficient facilities that are provided, and so we finally do away with the era of 
gold plated Taj Mahal palaces and high prices favoured by the BAA monopoly".

A Ryanair Boeing 737-800 on approach to Knock airport, Ireland, "only marginally avoided" controlled flight into 
terrain, according to the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) report on the 23 March incident. The AAIU says 
the principal cause was that both pilots fixated on reprogramming the flight management computer (FMC) while the 
aircraft continued its descent.A contributory cause was a "systemic failure" at the airline and at chart supplier 
Jeppesen, which meant the pilots did not have up-to-date information about the navigational aids at Knock.The two 
pilots were experienced 737-200 operators, but both had less than 400h on the -800. Before departure from London 
Gatwick they had programmed the FMC for a non-directional beacon (NDB) approach to runway 09 at Knock 
because they knew there was a strong easterly wind. But they did not know, because Ryanair's pre-flight briefing 
computer system data was incomplete, that such an approach was not available because of work on the navigation 
beacons at this non-radar airport. 
When the crew called Knock, they were told they would have to carry out an instrument landing system approach to 
reciprocal runway 27 from which they could join the visual circuit to land on 09, although the cloudbase - broken at 
900ft (275m) above ground level (AGL) - was marginal.What transpired, says the AAIU, was an unbriefed descent 
in which Shannon radar assisted the crew to intercept the ILS. But as the pilots fixated on reprogramming the FMC 
for the new approach, they arrived over the airport at 410ft AGL with gear and flaps up and an airspeed of 265kt

Body
A Ryanair Boeing 737-800 on approach to Knock airport, Ireland, "only marginally avoided" controlled flight into 
terrain, according to the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) report on the 23 March incident. The AAIU says 
the principal cause was that both pilots fixated on reprogramming the flight management computer (FMC) while the 
aircraft continued its descent.A contributory cause was a "systemic failure" at the airline and at chart supplier 
Jeppesen, which meant the pilots did not have up-to-date information about the navigational aids at Knock.The two 
pilots were experienced 737-200 operators, but both had less than 400h on the -800. Before departure from London 
Gatwick they had programmed the FMC for a non-directional beacon (NDB) approach to runway 09 at Knock 
because they knew there was a strong easterly wind. But they did not know, because Ryanair's pre-flight briefing 
computer system data was incomplete, that such an approach was not available because of work on the navigation 
beacons at this non-radar airport. 
When the crew called Knock, they were told they would have to carry out an instrument landing system approach to 
reciprocal runway 27 from which they could join the visual circuit to land on 09, although the cloudbase - broken at 
900ft (275m) above ground level (AGL) - was marginal.What transpired, says the AAIU, was an unbriefed descent 
in which Shannon radar assisted the crew to intercept the ILS. But as the pilots fixated on reprogramming the FMC 
for the new approach, they arrived over the airport at 410ft AGL with gear and flaps up and an airspeed of 265kt 
(490km/h). They saw the runway, heard the enhanced ground proximity warning system "too-low terrain" alert, and 
carried out a non-standard missed approach to join the "OK" NDB hold while they decided what to do. Knock ATC 
cleared them to hold at OK at 4,000ft from where, after 25min considering their options, they carried out a

Body
A buoyant financial sector failed to lift a sluggish Dublin market today as the ISEQ ended the week in negative 
fashion following four consecutive days of gains.
AIB and Anglo Irish Bank both moved higher today, up 4c to 21.49 and 17c to 15.44 respectively, after they both 
published trading updates in recent days.
In a trading statement released on Thursday, AIB again forecast full year earnings growth of "over 20pc". Although 
some market watchers were left disappointed by the forecast, Dolmen analyst, Stuart Draper, said "it should be 
remembered that AIB previously upgraded earnings guidance twice in 2006, and last year its year end trading 
statement gave an "in-line" update, only for the guidance to be beaten three months later when the full year results 
were announced".
 Much of that market disappointment was the result of recent stronger than expected results from Bank of Ireland 
and Anglo Irish Bank, the latter of which published its full year results on Wednesday. Anglo posted an impressive 
38pc rise in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to the end of September. The figures topped analysts forecasts by 
around 3pc. Elsewhere in the banking sector, Bank of Ireland slipped 5c to 16.65, while Irish Life and Permanent 
ended the day 10c higher at 19.75. Investors were also still trying to decipher comments from European Central 
Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet on Thursday, which seemed to suggest that the current cycle of interest rate 
hikes could be nearing its end. Despite raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.5pc at its 
December meeting, the ECB raised its euro zone growth forecasts and cut its inflation forecasts for 2006 and 2007. 
Analysts said this was a clear indication that the central bank is nearing the end of its cycle of interest rate 
increases. The uncertainty led to the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 9.76 points lower at 8917.15. Even a strong 
start on Wall Street failed to lift market sentiment after U.S. jobs data showed that the economy added 132,000 jobs 
in November, higher than the 105,000 jobs economists had expected. The unemployment rate, taken from a

separate survey of households, rose 0.1 percentage points to 4.5pc in the month. Back in Dublin, shares in CandC 
fell 25c to 12.05 on profit taking after takeover speculation sent the price soaring earlier in the week. Brewing giant 
SABMiller was the latest name to be linked with a takeover bid for the Bulmers manufacturer. Other notable movers 
included former state airline Aer Lingus, down 3c to 2.75, no-frills airline Ryanair, down 4c to 9.53, and bookmaker 
Paddy Power, down 18c to 15.90. In the construction sector, CRH was in the red, down 48c to 28.62, while Grafton 
and McInerney made modest progress, up 4c to 11.48 and 6c to 13.50 respectively. Shares in Kingspan added on 
8c to 17.80.

Price control decision compounds doubts about Stansted expansion
Price control decision compounds doubts about Stansted expansion

Body
Doubts about the potential expansion of Stansted grew yesterday following the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to 
recommend the airport be removed from the price control regime.
Ministers have previously backed the building of a second runway and terminal at Stansted as the first step in 
expanding capacity in the south-east. However, the airlines that use the airport, led by Ryanair and EasyJet, have 
been critical of the BAA's expansion proposals.
A year ago, the airport operator unveiled a Pounds 2.7bn plan to triple capacity at London's third airport to about 
76m passengers a year, more than Heathrow.
The plan drew opposition from airlines, local authorities and residents and environmental groups.
Mike Clasper, then BAA chief, said the earliest the first phase could be operational would be bythe end of 2013 but 
a "satisfactory pricing formula" from the CAA would give the BAA an incentive to deliver the second runway quickly.
If the regulatory regime was "too tight", the project would be "put back by some years".
EasyJet gave the CAA proposal "six out of 10" yesterday. It welcomed the "recognition that there is no business 
case" for the BAA's proposed expansion, but it insisted that there was a strong case for retaining price controls.
It rejected the CAA view that Stansted already faced competition from airports including Nottingham East Midlands, 
Birmingham and Luton.
The low-cost carrier said: "We don't see a need for a second runway yet, we are a long way off that."
The CAA said its investigation had found there was "only a limited possibility" that Stansted could enjoy a position 
of market power that justified price regulation. It said "competition and competition law is likely to prove a sufficient 
discipline" to allow price controls to be abandoned.
Price control decision compounds doubts about Stansted expansion
The CAA's proposal stems from an investigation of passenger flows that shows that Stansted does not have a large 
share of any particular market. In London it has 17 per cent of all passengers and 19 per cent of leisure 
passengers.
Almost 3m passengers (of a total volume of 23m) travelled more than two hours to reach Stansted, and many had a 
strong preference for regional airports. Airlines relocating as few as three aircraft from Stansted would significantly 
affect the airport's profitability and such a move would "discipline" any significant price increase.
In recent years, Stansted had in any case been unable to price up to the existing caps and it had not been a very 
profitable business.

 The document benchmarks employee costs per person at major airlines. It shows that employee costs at Aer 
Lingus have risen by 29 per cent in the last three years, whereas they have only risen at Ryanair by 4.9 per cent. In 
terms of employee costs the figure for Aer Lingus come to E72,478 per employee on average, with only British

Ryanair Holdings PLC is extending its increasingly doomed-looking takeover bid for Aer Lingus Group PLC for the 
second time after revealing Tuesday that less than 1 percent of its fellow Irish airline's shareholders have accepted 
the offer.
Ryanair ran into fierce opposition as soon as it launched its hostile 2.80 euro ($3.73) per share bid for Aer Lingus 
on Oct. 5 with other major shareholders and the Irish government opposed to a takeover.
The latest report that it has secured valid acceptances for 4.96 million shares, representing 0.9 percent of the stock, 
is an improvement from the 0.1 percent that Ryanair held on Nov. 13 when its first deadline expired.
But it still leaves the airline, which holds a stake of just over 25 percent in Aer Lingus, well short of the controlling 
stake it wants. Investors opposed to a buyout control more than 46 percent of shares.
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar acknowledged that a takeover of Aer Lingus "is probably a long shot 
at this stage."
The anti-Ryanair bloc includes the government, which retained 25.4 percent when it sold off most of its holding; a 
trust representing more than 4,600 current and former Aer Lingus employees that holds 12.6 percent; pension and 
investment funds controlled by Aer Lingus pilots that hold more than 4.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis 
O'Brien with a 2.1 percent stake.
In more bad news for Ryanair on Tuesday, it was revealed that one of its aircraft almost crashed at an Irish airport 
after the carrier failed to inform pilots about changes to the runway.
A report by Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit raised in Ireland's parliament found that the Boeing 737 from 
London's Gatwick to Knock in southern Ireland was carrying 144 passengers and crew last March when it 
marginally avoided crashing.

The report said that the aircraft had to make a sudden emergency ascent because the pilot was unaware that 
several navigational aids were switched off while the airport was being upgraded, despite Ryanair's being informed 
of the changes six weeks earlier.
Ryanair said it had cooperated fully with the AAIU report and had "accepted and implemented all of the 
recommendations made."
Ryanair shares fell 0.5 percent to close at 9.58 euros ($12.76) while Aer Lingus shares slipped 0.7 percent to finish 
at 2.72 euros ($3.62) on the Irish Stock Exchange.

The anti-Ryanair bloc includes the government, which retained 25.4 percent when it sold off most of its holding; a 
trust representing more than 4,600 current and former Aer Lingus employees that holds 12.6 percent; pension and 
investment funds controlled by Aer Lingus pilots that hold more than 4.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis 
O'Brien with a 2.1 percent stake.
In more bad news for the airline Tuesday, it was revealed that one of its aircraft almost crashed at an Irish airport 
after the carrier failed to inform pilots about changes to the runway.
A report by Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit raised in Ireland's parliament found that the Boeing 737 from 
London's Gatwick to Knock in southern Ireland was carrying 144 passengers and crew last March when it 
marginally avoided crashing.
Ryanair extends deadline on Aer Lingus bid, reports acceptances from 1 percent of shareholders
The report said that the aircraft had to make a sudden emergency ascent because the pilot was unaware that 
several navigational aids were switched off while the airport was being upgraded, despite Ryanair's being informed 
of the changes six weeks earlier.
The AAIU noted the captain and first officer were so engrossed in trying to reprogram the aircraft that they became 
distracted, before an alarm system warned they were approaching the ground, prompting an emergency ascent 
from the crew.
Ryanair said it had cooperated fully with the AAIU report and had "accepted and implemented all of the 
recommendations made."
Ryanair shares fell 0.5 percent to close at 9.58 euros ($12.76) while Aer Lingus shares slipped 0.7 percent to finish 
at 2.72 euros ($3.62) on the Irish Stock Exchange.

Ryanair Holdings PLC is extending its increasingly doomed-looking takeover bid for Aer Lingus Group PLC for the 
second time after revealing Tuesday that less than 1 percent of its fellow Irish carrier's shareholders have accepted 
the offer.
Ryanair ran into fierce opposition as soon as it launched its hostile €2.80 (US$3.73) per share bid for Aer Lingus on 
Oct. 5 with other major shareholders and the Irish government opposed to a takeover.
The latest report that it has secured valid acceptances for 4.96 million shares, representing 0.9 percent of the stock, 
is an improvement from the 0.1 percent that Ryanair held on Nov. 13 when its first deadline expired.
But it still leaves the airline, which holds a stake of just over 25 percent, well short of the controlling stake it wants. 
Investors opposed to a buyout control more than 46 percent of shares.
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar acknowledged that a takeover of Aer Lingus "is probably a long shot 
at this stage."
The anti-Ryanair bloc includes the government, which retained 25.4 percent when it sold off most of its holding; a 
trust representing more than 4,600 current and former Aer Lingus employees that holds 12.6 percent; pension and 
investment funds controlled by Aer Lingus pilots that hold more than 4.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis

AIB dragged the Dublin market sharply higher today as the ISEQ continued to recover from last week's heavy falls.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 45.85 points higher on 8737.78.
Shares in AIB closed safely in the black as it prepares to publish its pre-close trading statement on Thursday. 
Goodbody analyst, Eamonn Hughes, forecast that AIB's pre-close trading statement will include an EPS of 178.7c, 
representing 23pc growth.
 The share price was also boosted by weekend newspaper reports which suggested that AIB is planning to 
outsource its credit card processing capability to First Data, which is a part of Western Union. Mr Hughes said such 
a move could deliver savings in "tens of millions." Every E10 million would be accretive to Allied Irish Banks' EPS 
by approximately 1c, he said. Shares closed 13c higher on 21.25 in Dublin this evening. Elsewhere in the sector, 
shares in Anglo Irish Bank lacked direction, up a modest 3c to 14.40, with the company set to publish its full year 
results tomorrow. Bank of Ireland closed an impressive 15c higher on 16.31, while Irish Life and Permanent tacked 
on 24c to 19.34 after it reached an agreement with the Amicus union over a pensions dispute. Shares in IAWS fell 
8c to 18.80 on profit taking after the food group said at its annual general meeting on Monday that it is happy with 
the overall trading performance in the current year. Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair were down 11c to 9.52 after it 
further extended its deadline to Aer Lingus shareholders to accept its E1.48 billion takeover bid for the airline until 
December 22. The second deadline for acceptance of the Ryanair bid expired on Monday. In a stock exchange 
announcement today, Ryanair said that shareholders holding almost 5 million shares had accepted its offer, 
representing just under 1pc of the total shares in Aer Lingus. The airline also said today that its passenger numbers 
increased by 15pc in November compared to the same month in 2005. It said it carried 3.162 million people during 
the month compared to 2.749 last year. Shares in Aer Lingus lost 2c to 2.72 after trade union SIPTU called on the 
airline to give further details of its cost savings plans. The union particularly wants the airline to specify how much 
ISEQ closes 45 points higher on 8739.14
money the company hopes to save by cutting overheads. The airline revealed the cost-cutting programme last 
week, saying it plans to target 12 key areas including specific initiatives in staff costs, such as employee contracts, 
pay grades, overtime and air crew productivity. CRH was the star performer in the construction sector, up 21c to 
28.36, while Grafton tacked on 9c to 11.12. Meanwhile, Kingspan close 16c higher on 16.96 with McInerney up 3c 
to 13.23. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, up 21c to 16.20, media group UTV, up 25c to 
5.50, ferry group Irish Continental, up 17c to 12.90, and drinks firm C and C, up 10c to 11.50.

Body
It is axiomatic that one of the most critical aspects of running a modern airline profitably and safely is the 
relationship between the company and its frontline employees - the ones that deliver the service the customers 
actually see and feel. These include check-in staff, cabin crew and pilots.Behind the scenes another critical group is 
the engineers and mechanics. If aeroplanes don't work, no business gets done if they go wrong operations are 
disrupted, accident risk increases, and the company image suffers.All these people are company assets. Training 
cabin crew and check-in staff is not as expensive as training engineers and pilots, so high staff turnover in those 
departments is less costly and easier to deal with. 
High turnover among pilots and engineers is costly, and both these specialised professions in the fast-growing 
airline world are a finite resource. If the airlines don't do their recruitment and training planning well for these groups 
- and history shows they don't - resources like pilots and engineers cannot be generated overnight. There is a long 
training lead time, and the supply systems are not, at present, geared up for the global demand.For these reasons 
the relationship airlines have with their pilots and engineering staff is important if the companies are to get the best 
out of them, and to cut departures by skilled staff to more appealing alternative employers. These issues were 
examined at Flight International's Crew Management Conference in Brussels two weeks ago. The alternative 
management styles for interfacing with the pilot workforce were studied in two presentations entitled "Can 
recognising a pilot association be good management in a modern airline?" Well, there would have been two 
presentations, but despite our best efforts, no airline would take up the challenge of arguing its case - either for or 
against the proposition. Meanwhile, president of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association Capt Evan Cullen put the case - 
predictably - that recognition was good for airlines, and then the subject was thrown open to the floor for 
discussion.Southwest Airlines has its own pilot association, which works with management EasyJet does not have 
a formal relationship with a pilot association but always talks to pilot representatives but Ryanair - with its Dublin 
headquarters in Capt Cullen's back yard - refuses to recognise any form of pilot association. These are all 
successful low-cost airlines, but Ryanair has the biggest profit margins. Does that mean pilot associations are bad 
news for shareholders? Such a conclusion would be overly simplistic.Cullen says carriers typically have one of 
three sorts of relationships with their pilot workforce: co-operative, benign or hostile. That sounds suspiciously like, 
respectively, Southwest, EasyJet and Ryanair, but no names were mentioned. Perhaps the adjective "hostile" is 
arguable, but clearly Cullen chose it in preference to "adversarial", and cases brought - and lost - by Ryanair in the 
Prize assets
Irish courts recently against individual pilots and IALPA testify to a combative approach. KLM, represented at the 
conference, would fit in the "co-operative" category, and it declares it does not have any pilot turnover.Cullen 
concentrated on the demonstrable operational effects of these three different kinds of relationships with pilots. 
According to IALPA data, in a co-operative or benign environment, pilots tend to report safety-related incidents and 
problems that might affect their safe performance, whereas in a "hostile" environment the figures show a marked 
tendency for pilots to cover up problems - or at least to fail to report them. This was highlighted when operational 
data monitoring became mandatory in Europe: pilot incident reporting in "hostile" environments increased by about 
80%, says Cullen. That may not constitute proof that 80% of reportable incidents were previously not reported, but it 
makes you wonder.Pilots care about doing their job well. It's one of those professions in which a drop in 
performance shows immediately: everybody recognises a bad landing, especially the pilot who did it. Setting up an 
adversarial relationship with pilots is bad for safety, and accidents are bad for business. Any airline operating a 
hostile system is walking a safety tightrope, however well they train their pilots.And the result of the floor discussion 
following Cullen's presentation? No-one challenged him.see headlines P7, air transport P13

Shares on the Dublin market were marginally up this morning. 
Around midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 29.04 at 8654.85. 
Financial shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland was down 2c to 16.03 and AIB climbed 20c to 20.90. Anglo Irish Bank

will be its preclose trading statement on Thursday. Eamonn Hughes, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers today said, 
"We are forecasting a 23pc EPS jump to 178.7 cent, but of course the market will be hoping that this important data

Body
The Dublin share market managed a significant rebound today from last week's decline, as investors sought out 
bargains against the background of a falling US dollar.
The banking sector, a significant faller last week, clawed back some of its losses.
AIB led the way, climbing 42c to 2112, with Bank of Ireland tailing behind with a rise of 19c to 1616. Anglo Irish 
Bank was up 5c to 1437 and Irish Life & Permanent rose 5c to 1910. 
 While bargain hunting was the main driver behind the rises, brokers said the variability of the rebounds reflected a 
growing sensitivity in the market to how banks will weather the growing competition that it at last breaking out in 
their sector. In that sense AIB was helped by a weekend newspaper report that it is considering outsourcing its 
credit card processing capability as a cost-saving measure to First Data, part of Western Union. And it was also 
helped by anticipation of its pre-close trading statement on Thursday. Eamonn Hughes, analyst at Goodbody 
Stockbrokers said, 'We are forecasting a 23pc earnings per share jump to 178.7 cent, but of course the market will 
be hoping that this important data set provides another opportunity to maintain the positive EPS revisions cycle.' 
Evidence of the increased competition in the sector came yesterday with figures from the Irish Bankers Federation 
(IBF), suggesting that by the end of 2006 a cumulative 32,000 customers will have moved their personal current 
accounts, using the new switching code systerm. The IBF reckons that the code has prompted additional mobility 
and that, including those who have moved without using it, total switchers have amounted to around 4pc so far. 
Brokers also say that the market is now watching carefully to see how the projected fall in private sector credit and 
a probable easing in the property market will all impact on the profitability of banks here. Turning to the construction 
sector, shares there put in a modestly positive performance today, with CRH up 25c to 2815, after seeing some 
E800m wiped off its value in the past two weeks as investors reacted to the cost to the group of a slump in the 
value of the US dollar. Kingspan gained 8c to 1680 and Grafton climbed similarly to 1103. McInerney was 
unchanged at 1320. The latest Euroconstruct conference of top building industry notables in Holland has predicted 
ISEQ closes 66.12 points higher at 8,691
that Ireland's construction sector growth next will fall to just 0.6pc from 3.4pc previously forecast. This slackening 
trend will continue into 2008, the conference heard, when Ireland's construction sector is expected to shrink by 
2.6pc, from a previous growth forecast of 1.3pc. Elsewhere, shares at bookmaker Paddy Power rose 49c to 1599 
and no- frills airline Ryanair gained 5c to 963. Shares in food group, Greencore, fell by 8c to 410 ahead of its 
preliminary results tomorrow. 'While we forecast headline adjusted earnings per share to decline 4.9pc to 30.9c, its 
core convenience foods' continuing operations are expected to report profit growth of circa 5pc' said Goodbody 
analyst, Liam Igoe. He added that the preliminary statement will provide the company with an opportunity to give an 
update on current UK trading conditions, its property development plans and the sugar compensation issue.

But the airline's management insisted jobs would not be axed without agreement from workers.
The airline had been obliged by the Takeover Panel to detail staff-cost savings referred to in its defence document

 Under the plan, the board of the recently privatised airline will bring in new staff contracts, simplify pay grades and

Body
Ireland's new wealth was on display again this week with two landmark deals.
Mid-week, Barry O'Callaghan, a 37-year-old former banker, announced his Riverdeep educational software 
company had completed a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) reverse takeover of Houghton Mifflin, one of biggest US 
textbook publishers.
The next day the asset-hungry Irish bought another iconic British building when Real Estate Opportunities, the listed 
vehicle of accountant Johnny Ronan and lawyer Richard Barrett, paid Pounds 400m to the Taiwanese Hwang 
family for the Battersea Power Station.
In barely a generation, Ireland has transformed itself into one of the world's strongest performing economies. It has 
been helped by low corporate taxes, the assistance Ireland leveraged out from Brussels and the advent of US 
companies such as Intel and Microsoft who have turned the country into a key location for US overseas investment.
There is little doubt that it has unleashed the national entrepreneurial spirit.
Roy Foster, professor of Irish history at Oxford University, dubbed the Irish who made fortunes in Victorian Britain 
"micks on the make". Until the mid-1990s, those wanting to make it big in business had to go abroad to make their 
fortune.
Sir Anthony O'Reilly, among Ireland's best-known businessmen, spent a career at Heinz, the US foods giant, 
retiring as chairman, the first non-Heinz family member to hold that position.
Unlike many Irish-born businessmen of his generation, he reinvested the money he earned, buying into Irish 
companies such as Independent News & Media and Waterford Wedgwood.
New rich make their mark John Murray Brown explains how a pairof deals this week illustrates the power of the 
rejuvenated Irish business spirit
Even those who stayed in Ireland realised they had to expand overseas to achieve success. Jefferson Smurfit, the 
paper and packaging company, was Ireland's first true multinational, but barely 10 per cent of its turnover was in 
Ireland. Today, perhaps Ireland's best-known company is Ryanair, run by the flamboyant Michael O'Leary. The 
group is worth almost as much as British Airways.
"These guys have shown that if you're Irish there is no reason you can't be a global leader. That's a great 
inspiration for young managers today," says Damien McLoughlin, chief executive of Dublin's Michael Smurfit 
Business School.
The wealth today is more likely to be homegrown. JP McManus, a former bookmaker, reportedly made his first 
million betting on the Irish pound leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. He now has a range of 
investments with longtime collaborator John Magnier, owner of the renowned Coolmore stable.
They profited together from an investment in Manchester United football club, before selling to the Glazer family. 
With Dermot Desmond, the financier and Celtic football club investor, they own several showpiece assets including 
the Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados.
In the past few years, property has been the asset class in which Ireland's new rich have felt most comfortable 
investing. Many have made their money trading in the family farm, in areas re-zoned for industrial use or the family 
store, acquired by one of the big retail groups.
The Bank of Ireland calculates property assets have risen by 350 per cent in the past 10 years. Matt Dempsey, 
editor of the Farmers Journal, says: "Anyone with 20 acres of land on the edge of even the smallest town is likely to 
be a millionaire in today's Ireland."
Mr O'Callaghan of Riverdeep says few of the investors that stock broker Davy rustled up to take equity in his 
company were household names. "What was amazing in a room of say 200 people, I hardly knew a single face."
Tony Garry, managing director of Davy, says: "The money is relatively new, it's dynamic. It's probably more 
aggressive than the older money, for want of a better word."
Some of the new found wealth is evident in conspicuous consumption. The Irish marina market is booming and Irish 
art is a must-have for the new elite.
Derek Quinlan, a former Irish tax inspector, heads Quinlan Private, which owns the Berkeley, the Connaught and 
Claridges hotels in London. "I've made a lot of people in this country a lot of money," he says.
Mark Cunningham, managing director of Bank of Ireland private banking, argues that Irish investors tend to be less 
risk-averse: "I don't think this is because we have more of a punting mentality. There is just a greater willingness to 
take risk."
He says compared with Swiss and US banks where a typical investment portfolio might contain 20-30 per cent of 
debt, in Ireland the figure is closer to 60-70 per cent.
Denis O'Brien is typical of the new wealthy. He made Pounds 240m selling his Esat Telecom to BT in 2000. Mr 
O'Brien moved to Portugal, developing a golf resort there. Now he hopes to float his Digicel Caribbean mobile 
company on the New York Stock Exchange.
He says there is a striking difference between his generation and that of Sir Anthony: "I'm an entrepreneur; he runs 
companies."
A criticism of Ireland's new rich is the high number of wheeler-dealers. "Property developers don't add much value," 
says Ivor Kenny, the Irish management guru. "Good managers are still the life blood of the economy."
New rich make their mark John Murray Brown explains how a pairof deals this week illustrates the power of the 
rejuvenated Irish business spirit
While large amounts have been invested in property, the venture capital industry - arguably a guide of an ability to 
foster new businesses - has not attracted much.
Tom McCarthy, director of the Irish management institute, is more positive: "Many of our companies are still in the 
growth phase. The big question is whether they can build and sustain their businesses and turn them into the global 
Irish companies."

Body
AIB and Bank of Ireland weighed heavy on the Dublin market today as the ISEQ index closed in negative territory 
for the fourth day this week.
The ISEQ index closed 68.52 points lower on 8625.81, down 270 points for the week as a whole.
AIB was the main faller in the financial sector, down 35c to 20.70, as it prepares to release a trading statement 
Thursday next. Bank of Ireland was also in the red, down 15c to 16.05, while Irish Life & Permanent managed to 
buck the trend, adding on 8c to 19.08. Shares in Anglo Irish Bank fell 15c to 14.20 ahead if its results for the full 
year on Wednesday.
 The sharp falls in the banking sector outweighed gains in no frills airline Ryanair and fencing and scaffolding firm 
Siteserv. After falling heavily on Thursday, shares in Ryanair were up 20c to 9.60 today despite admitting earlier in 
the week that its takeover bid for Aer Lingus was a "long shot". Fencing and scaffolding firm Siteserv was also in 
the black, up 1c to 0.84, after it announced this week that it has bought infrastructure operator Holgate Fencing

The European Commission has postponed by 14 days its decision on whether to approve Ryanair's proposed E1.4 
billion purchase of Aer Lingus.
A spokeswoman for the commission said yesterday that it had put back the deadline to give it time to consider the 
proposed remedies to competition concerns as put forward on Wednesday evening by Ryanair.
She declined to give details, but any concessions by Ryanair are expected to relate to European routes where both 
carriers currently operate flights.
 Analysts said they weren't surprised by the extension, and sources familiar with the situation said it is quite normal 
for such an extension to be granted. The commission now has until December 20th, rather than the 6th, to decide 
whether to approve the transaction with the concessions offered by Ryanair, to approve it with more concessions, to 
refer it to another antitrust authority or to open a four-month extended review.

Ryanair CFO says Aer Lingus buy 'probably a long shot'

Ryanair's chief financial officer Thursday conceded that the airline's takeover of Irish rival Aer Lingus was currently 
looking unlikely.
In a speech to an airlines conference, CFO Howard Miller said a takeover of Aer Lingus Group PLC "is probably a 
long shot at this stage," because shareholders representing about 46 percent of the airline's share capital are 
against the bid.
His comments echo recent remarks by Ryanair Holdings PLC's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, who said the deal 
was unlikely to proceed because of opposition from the likes of Aer Lingus' Employee Share Ownership Trust, 
which owns 12.5 percent of the airline's share capital.
Ryanair which has made a 1.48 billion euro ($1.95 billion) bid for Aer Lingus earlier this week raised its stake in the 
carrier to just over 25 percent. A takeover is conditional on acquiring at least 50.1 percent of the share capital.
Miller said Ryanair increased its stake from about 19 percent to take advantage of a recent fall in the Aer Lingus 
share price, to make it more difficult for a counterbid and to give Ryanair certain minority shareholding rights.
For example, Ryanair can now block special resolutions at Aer Lingus Extraordinary General Meetings.
Miller repeated that Ryanair won't raise its offer for Aer Lingus.
However, Ryanair is facing a host of current Aer Lingus shareholders who are opposed to the bid, including the 
ESOT, the Irish Government, which holds about 25 percent, Aer Lingus pilots who hold about 2.27 percent, and 
Irish entrepreneur Denis O'Brien who holds about 2.1 percent.
ESOT members last week voted 97 percent against Ryanair's 2.80 euro ($3.68) a share bid.
Ryanair also faces hurdles in getting a deal past the European Union antitrust regulators.
Ryanair CFO says Aer Lingus buy 'probably a long shot'
Earlier Thursday, the E.U. extended its antitrust review to Dec. 20 from Dec. 6 to give it more time to study 
"remedies" offered by Ryanair, a commission official said. In such cases, remedies typically are selloffs designed to 
avoid antitrust problems.

Ryanair weighed heavy on the Dublin market today as the ISEQ's volatile week continued.
Shares in the airline closed 30c lower on 9.40, after it admitted that its bid for Aer Lingus was "a long shot". The 
airline's chief financial officer, Howard Millar, made the admission despite Ryanair having taken its stake in Aer 
Lingus to 25pc earlier this week. 
Shares were also hit after the European Commission announced it has delayed a decision on Ryanair's proposed 
purchase of Aer Lingus from December 6 to December 20 in order to consider possible remedies. The proposed 
remedies would fix anti-competitive problems identified by the Commission. Shares in Aer Lingus were down 1c to 
2.73 in Dublin today.
 The airlines dragged the ISEQ index of Irish shares 43.12 points lower to 8694.33. AIB was the star performer in 
an otherwise negative financial sector, adding on 1c to 21.00, as it prepares to release a trading statement next 
Thursday. Dolmen Securities analyst, Stuart Draper, said "Given the particularly strong earnings growth generated 
by the group's Capital Markets and Polish divisions in H1 2006, as well as the more robust than expected credit 
quality, and more resilient than expected net interest margin trends this year, this trading statement should be 
justifiably upbeat, confirming 2006 earnings growth of over 20pc". Meanwhile, shares were also boosted by the 
news that the UK arm of AIB has been voted the best business bank in Britain for the 7th year in a row, in a 
biannual survey of the business sector. The survey, commissioned by the Forum of Private Business, found the 'Big 
Four' British banks continue to lag behind smaller rivals, led once more by AIB, in the battle for commercial 
customer satisfaction. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Anglo Irish Bank was down 12c to 14.40 as it prepares to 
publish its results for the full year on Wednesday. Investors are anticipating good news from the bank. "Current 
consensus estimates of 90c and 106c for 2006 and 2007 respectively imply growth of 27pc and 18pc," Davy 
Stockbrokers said. Shares in Irish Life & Permanent fell 31c to 19.04, while Bank of Ireland lost 10c to close at

broadcaster has renewed its interest in a merger with Virgin Radio owner SMG. The Times said UTV has 
approached SMG with a merger proposal to create a media group worth around £400m (E592m). It comes just 
three months after SMG turned down two "unacceptable" merger offers from talkSport owner UTV. The first offer 
proposed a nil-premium merger while the second offered SMG a slightly bigger share of the combined company.

Body
British Airways' aim of playing a leading role in the consolidation of the European airline industry was jolted 
yesterday when Iberia, its leading alliance partner in Europe, expressed unhappiness with the relationship.
The Spanish flag-carrier, in which BA holds a 10 per cent stake, opened the door to potential link-ups with BA's 
main European rivals, AirFrance-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa.
Enrique Dupuy, Iberia's chief financial officer, told Expansion, the Financial Times' Spanish partner paper, that BA 
had not made Iberia one of its priorities.
"In a marriage you need two . . . our priorities and those of BA are not always the same," he said.
The two airlines agreed a strategic alliance in 1999, triggering speculation that BA could eventually buy the smaller 
carrier. This month, BA increased its stake in Iberia from 9 per cent to 10 per cent to secure its two current seats on 
the airline's board.
Mr Dupuy yesterday suggested the possibility of talks with other European groups.
"Everything points to three large European airline groups with a global presence: AirFrance-KLM, Lufthansa and, 
probably, BA. We are going to be part of one of them," he said.
Iberia sees the recent bid by Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus, its smaller Irish rival, as a signal of more changes to 
come. "It is going to be the beginning of a merger process among the European carriers," Mr Dupuy said.
Last week Air France-KLM said that it was in "exploratory" talks with Alitalia, which could lead to an eventual 
takeover of the lossmaking Italian airline.
Asked whether a BA merger could still go ahead, Mr Dupuy said: "For an integration process, you need both parts 
to have the same desire. That could still happen with BA, but it could also happen with other companies."
BA 's hopes for consolidation in Europe dented by Iberia
He said that there were "clear" advantages for an alliance between Iberia with either Air France-KLM or Lufthansa. 
Iberia dominates the routes between Europe and Latin America with a market share of 18.7 per cent.
Mr Dupuy's comments cast doubts about the vision for the consolidation of the European airline industry around the 
three existing alliances - SkyTeam, led by Air France-KLM; Star, led by Lufthansa; and Oneworld, led by BA and 
including Iberia.
*John Reid, home secretary, will make a statement to parliament today after it emerged that small traces of a 
radioactive substance linked to the death of the Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy, were found on at 
least two British Airways aircraft at Heathrow. A third jet has been taken out of service in Moscow pending 
examination, BA said.

Ryanair has joined with residents, environmentalists and others against the proposed new terminal at Dublin 
Airport.
Last night, An Bord Pleanala had received appeals from seven parties, including four individuals, Ryanair and An 
Taisce, who all oppose the Terminal Two project. 
The Dublin Airport Authority has itself asked the board to look at the conditions imposed by Fingal County Council 
in granting planning permission.
 The United Portmarnock Residents Opposing Another Runway said the council was trying to divorce the terminal 
plan from other developments at the airport. "We have no objection to the reasonable development of the airport, 
but we are most concerned with the proposed new terminal, which, in conjunction with other developments such as 
a proposed new parallel runway, will have a deleterious and long-lasting impact on the lives, amenity and welfare of 
all residents in the Portmarnock area." The DAA was granted initial planning permission by the council at the end of 
October.

Ryanair yesterday maintained pressure on Aer Lingus by increasing its shareholding from 19.2 to 25.2 per cent. 
This almost matches the 25.35 per cent held by the Irish government.
Europe's leading low-cost carrier launched a Euros 2.80 a share hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus last month, 
valuing the airline at Euros 1.48bn.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has taken advantage of the weakness in the price to build Ryanair's stake 
to a blocking minority, buying another 31.8m shares, or 6 per cent, at prices between Euros 2.72 and Euros 2.75 a 
share.
The stake will still not entitle Ryanair to a seat on the Aer Lingus board, however, without gaining a majority vote to 
back such a move.

Body
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has raised its stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group PLC to 25.2 percent in a 
renewed push to take over the recently privatized carrier, Ryanair's broker confirmed Wednesday.
Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin said it purchased nearly 31.8 million Aer Lingus shares Tuesday for about €87.4 
million (US$115.1 million) on behalf of Ryanair, raising the carrier's stake from 19.2 percent to 25.2 percent, or 
nearly 133.4 million shares.
Trading in Aer Lingus, the former state-owned airline that floated on the Irish and British exchanges Sept. 27, was 
exceptionally heavy in the last hour of business Tuesday, when its previously slumping share price surged €0.10 
(US$0.13) to €2.75 (US$3.62).
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said he understood that Ryanair now owned more than 25 percent of 
his airline. He conceded this meant Ryanair's interest "isn't going away any time soon," but reiterated Aer Lingus' 
determination to remain independent.
The raised stake does not markedly improve the chances that Ryanair's bid, launched Oct. 5 at €2.80 (US$3.69) a 
share, will reach the minimum 50 percent ownership threshold it requires to succeed. Investors opposed to a buyout 
control more than 46 percent of Aer Lingus shares.
The anti-Ryanair bloc includes the government, which retained 25.4 percent when it sold off most of its holding; a 
trust representing more than 4,600 current and former Aer Lingus employees that holds 12.6 percent; pension and 
investment funds controlled by Aer Lingus pilots that hold more than 4.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis 
O'Brien, who bought a 2.1 stake specifically to complicate Ryanair's campaign.
However, raising its ownership of Aer Lingus above 25 percent will afford Ryanair increased rights to meddle in the 
key decision-making of its major Irish competitor. Ryanair could wield a blocking vote at extraordinary general 
meetings, when Aer Lingus chiefs could be seeking shareholder approval to buy airlines, expand route networks or 
make other strategic decisions to improve its head-to-head competition with Ryanair.
Ryanair raises stake in takeover battle for rival Irish airline Aer Lingus
The increased Ryanair stake also makes it even tougher for any other potential suitor, such as British Airways PLC, 
to mount its own takeover bid for Aer Lingus. British Airways is run by Willie Walsh, who previously oversaw the 
drastic 2002-05 restructuring of Aer Lingus and tried to persuade the government to accept a management buyout 
of the Irish flag carrier. Aer Lingus and British Airways also have a code-sharing agreement.
Aer Lingus came close to bankruptcy in 2001 because of a bloated payroll and collapsing business on its key U.S. 
routes in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Walsh slashed staffing in half, shifted business to lower-fare 
European destinations and adopted an Internet-based sales system similar to Ryanair's a formula that saw Aer 
Lingus become one of the few profitable state-owned airlines.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says his company, if successful in acquiring Aer Lingus, would preserve 
the brand but make the airline much leaner. He says this could mean cutting another 1,000 of the 3,300 current 
workers a key reason why the government, labor unions and Aer Lingus employee shareholders are so hostile to 
the bid, which offers investors a 27 percent premium on the IPO price.
Shareholders have until Dec. 4 to accept or reject the bid. So far, Ryanair says only 0.12 percent of affected 
shareholders have returned forms accepting the offer, which becomes valid only if Ryanair can secure a minimum 
50 percent. If it fails, Ryanair has until Dec. 8 to decide whether to relaunch a sweetened bid.
Aer Lingus is expected to publish its final arguments against a Ryanair takeover on Friday a plan expected to detail 
its less drastic plans to cut costs and boost efficiencies. European Union competition chiefs are expected to publish 
their initial findings on the matter next week, although officials in both airlines do not expect the EU to offer any 
clear-cut views because the current Ryanair bid appears unlikely to succeed.
Shares in Aer Lingus lost their initial gains Wednesday and closed a cent lower at €2.74 (US$3.61) on the Irish 
Stock Exchange. Ryanair rose 26 cents (US$0.34), or 2.8 percent, to €9.70 (US$12.78).

euros ($115.1 million) on behalf of Ryanair, raising the carrier's stake from 19.2 percent to 25.2 percent, or nearly 
133.4 million shares.
Trading in Aer Lingus, the former state-owned airline that debuted on the Irish and British exchanges Sept. 27, was 
exceptionally heavy in the last hour of business Tuesday, when its previously slumping share price surged 0.10 
euro cents (13 cents) to 2.75 euros ($3.62).
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said he understood that Ryanair now owned more than 25 percent of 
his airline. He conceded this meant Ryanair's interest "isn't going away any time soon," but reiterated Aer Lingus' 
determination to remain independent.
The raised stake does not markedly improve the chances that Ryanair's bid, launched Oct. 5 at 2.80 euros ($3.69) 
a share, will reach the minimum 50 percent ownership threshold it requires to succeed. Investors opposed to a 
buyout control more than 46 percent of Aer Lingus shares.
The anti-Ryanair bloc includes the government, which retained 25.4 percent when it sold off most of its holding; a 
trust representing more than 4,600 current and former Aer Lingus employees that holds 12.6 percent; pension and 
investment funds controlled by Aer Lingus pilots that hold more than 4.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis 
O'Brien, who bought a 2.1 stake specifically to complicate Ryanair's campaign.
However, raising its ownership of Aer Lingus above 25 percent will afford Ryanair increased rights to meddle in the 
key decision-making of its major Irish competitor. Ryanair could wield a blocking vote at extraordinary general 
meetings, when Aer Lingus chiefs could be seeking shareholder approval to buy airlines, expand route networks or 
make other strategic decisions to improve its head-to-head competition with Ryanair.
Ryanair raises stake in takeover battle for rival Irish airline Aer Lingus
The increased Ryanair stake also makes it even tougher for any other potential suitor, such as British Airways PLC, 
to mount its own takeover bid for Aer Lingus. British Airways is run by Willie Walsh, who previously oversaw the 
drastic 2002-05 restructuring of Aer Lingus and tried to persuade the government to accept a management buyout 
of the Irish flag carrier. Aer Lingus and British Airways also have a code-sharing agreement.
Aer Lingus came close to bankruptcy in 2001 because of a bloated payroll and collapsing business on its key U.S. 
routes in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Walsh slashed staffing in half, shifted business to lower-fare 
European destinations and adopted an Internet-based sales system similar to Ryanair's a formula that saw Aer 
Lingus become one of the few profitable state-owned airlines.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says his company, if successful in acquiring Aer Lingus, would preserve 
the brand but make the airline much leaner. He says this could mean cutting another 1,000 of the 3,300 current 
workers a key reason why the government, labor unions and Aer Lingus employee shareholders are so hostile to 
the bid, which offers investors a 27 percent premium on the IPO price.
Shareholders have until Dec. 4 to accept or reject the bid. So far, Ryanair says only 0.12 percent of affected 
shareholders have returned forms accepting the offer, which becomes valid only if Ryanair can secure a minimum 
50 percent. If it fails, Ryanair has until Dec. 8 to decide whether to relaunch a sweetened bid.
Aer Lingus is expected to publish its final arguments against a Ryanair takeover on Friday a plan expected to detail 
its less drastic plans to cut costs and boost efficiencies. European Union competition chiefs are expected to publish 
their initial findings on the matter next week, although officials in both airlines do not expect the EU to offer any 
clear-cut views because the current Ryanair bid appears unlikely to succeed.
Shares in Aer Lingus rose 0.7 percent to close at 2.74 euros ($3.60) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Ryanair rose 2.6 
percent to close at 9.70 euros ($12.75).

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has raised its stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus Group PLC to 25.2 percent in a

Body
Aer Lingus chief executive has played down the significance of Ryanair's purchase yesterday of extra shares in his 
airline.
'It confirms my own view they are not going anywhere anytime soon,' Dermot Mannion told The Future of Air 
Transport conference in London.
Ryanair confirmed this morning that it had raised its stake in the flag carrier to 25.2 pc.
 In a disclosure to the stock exchange, it said that that Coinside Ltd, Ryanair's vehicle, yesterday purchased a 
further 31.8 m shares at prices ranging from 2.72-2.75 euro. It now holds 133.4 mln Aer Lingus shares. Analysts 
say the purchase will be interpreted as underlining Ryanair's determination to eventually take over Aer Lingus even 
if, as is expected, its current bid fails. Ryanair launched its 2.80 euro a share, 1.48 bn euro, hostile bid on Oct 5. 
However, analysts believe it has no chance of success and the airline has stated it will not raise its offer. Opponents 
of the bid already hold some 46.6 pc -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6 pc, the 
Irish government with 25.4 pc, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pc, the Tailwind employees/pilots group with 4.2 pc, and 
telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pc -- making the arithmetic nigh on impossible for Ryanair. Mr Mannion also 
said this morning that Aer Lingus will present details of its cost-cutting programme to unions by the end of this 
week. The Irish Takeover Panel said last week Aer Lingus must publish the details of a cost-cutting programme 
planned for next year by December 1.

Air Berlin, Europe's third largest low-cost air carrier, rattled investors yesterday as it announced the purchase of 60 
Boeing 737 airliners by 2014, bringing the list price of planes it has on order from the US company to Dollars 5.7bn, 
writes Gerrit Wiesmann in Frankfurt.
The airline's shares fell 12 per cent to Euros 114.22 in Frankfurt, amid fears that the group would have to issue new 
shares to pay for the planes, although a spokesman said he had "no information" about such a move.
The company went public in May to raise money to finance an order for 70 single-aisle A320 planes from Boeing's 
European rival Airbus. The Airbus order carries a list price of around Euros 5bn (Dollars 6.5bn) and is due for 
delivery by 2011.
Chief executive Joachim Hunold wants to expand the airline's European network and reduce its dependence on 
charter flights to challenge the UK-listed Ryanair and Easyjet.
In August, he said he paid a price in the "mid two-digit-millions" for German rival dba, once British Airways' German 
subsidiary, to gain control of the airline's slots at Munich and Dusseldorf airports.
With dba, Air Berlin took over an order for 25 Boeing 737s, which it decided to increase by a further 60 in talks over 
the past few weeks. At the end of the third quarter, Air Berlin and dba operated 89 aircraft, the group said.
In July, August and September the carrier saw revenues rise 28 per cent to Euros 510m. Operating earnings before 
interest and taxes rose 5 per cent to Euros 54.3m. The group has carried 12.2m passengers since the New Year.

This brings its shareholding in Aer Lingus up from 19pc to 25pc. The shares were bought at an average price of

It is understood the shares were purchased from a US hedge fund. 
 'Aer Lingus' view is that this does not change anything. We believe do not believe the offer from Ryanair represents 
good value for shareholders,' a spokesman for the airline said tonight. Despite this evening's development, 
shareholders opposed to the Michael O'Leary-led bid still own over 46pc of Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus shares closed

Financial shares were the big losers today as shares on the Dublin market went into freefall for the second day 
running. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 120.43 points lower on 8625.90 this evening, meaning that the index has lost 
almost 250 points so far this week.
The banks suffered heavy losses amid a plethora of releases about the future of stamp duty, next months budget 
and economic forecasts from the OECD.
 In its Quarterly Economic Bulletin Friends First today urged the Government to abolish stamp duty for first time 
buyers and to double mortgage interest relief in the 2007 Budget. The firm's chief economist, Jim Power, also 
predicted further interest rate increases from the ECB bringing the base rate up to 4pc during 2007. AIB was the 
biggest faller in the sector, down 58c to 20.57, while Bank of Ireland fell 11c to 16.05 and Irish Life & Permanent 
lost 39c to close at 19.40. Shares in Anglo Irish Bank also slipped into the red as it prepares to publish its full year 
results next week. Shares closed 12c lower on 14.20. The market was also hit by news of a larger than expected 
drop in durable goods orders in October in the U.S. The report raised concern that the U.S. economy is slowing far 
more than initially anticipated and increased the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates early 
next year. A lower-than-expected reading of consumer confidence in November added to the negative sentiment. 
However, the market did get some relief from data that showed existing home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly rose 
by 0.5pc to 6.24 million units in October from the previous month. CRH led the fallers in the construction sector, 
down 34c to 28.15, while Kingspan lost 28c to 16.71. McInerney closed 15c lower, while Grafton managed top buck 
the trend, tacking on 1c to 11.01. Elsewhere today, shares in Petroceltic, the Irish oil and gas exploration and 
production company, closed unchanged on 0.22 despite announcing has completed drilling at its Hassi Tab Tab 2

the market, climbing 8c to 2.75 after it announced a 6pc rise in passengers numbers for the month of October. The 
airline also released figures for the first 10 months of the year, which showed an 8pc rise in passenger numbers to 
just over 7.3 million. Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair fell 11c to 9.45. Other notable movers included broadcaster 
UTV, down 39c to 5.49, bookmaker Paddy Power, down 23c to 15.35, shipping, transport and leisure group Irish

overwhelmingly against accepting the bid. Ninety seven per cent of a 70% turnout voted against the takeover. The

Shares in Dublin plummeted by more than 100 points today as Wall Street slipped on ongoing concerns about the 
weak dollar and firming oil prices.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 126.37 points lower on 8746.33.
After major falls were exaggerated last week by thin trading conditions as the US observed the Thanksgiving 
holiday, the pressure on the dollar continued yesterday as trading returned to normal levels.
 The mood in the US is set to remain one of caution as investors gear up to a string of economic data this week, 
with October durable goods orders, consumer confidence data and comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke 
all expected tomorrow. A revised third quarter GDP reading is also due out on Wednesday. In the currency markets, 
the US dollar came off earlier lows but remained under pressure at 1.9367 to the pound and USD1.3121 against the 
euro. The greenback was still showing signs of a hangover from last week when strong German data and 
comments from the Chinese central bank deputy governor dented sentiment on the currency. Analysts said 
complaints from European politicians about the euro's steep gains helped limit the dollar's declines, however, most 
predict that the dollar's falls have only stalled temporarily. Politicians are wary about the euro's ascent against the 
dollar, as it will weigh on the competitiveness of European exports. Meanwhile, oil prices hovered above the USD60 
mark, as the market found support from a Saudi warning that OPEC will likely cut output again next month. The 
concerns in the US weighed heavy on CRH in Dublin, down 56c to 28.49, while other construction shares were 
mixed. Grafton fell 24c to 11.00, while Kingspan lost 6c to 17.08. McInerney bucked the trend, closing 6c higher at 
13.21. The financial sector was dragged lower by AIB, down 50c to 21.15, after Bank of Ireland announced it is to 
offer a 6pc interest rate to savers. Shares in Bank of Ireland fell 34c to 16.16, while Anglo Irish Bank closed 12c 
lower on 14.48. Irish Life and Permanent ended the day just 1c lower at 19.79. Elsewhere, shares in Ryanair lost 
16c to 9.56 after it last week ruled out any increase in its bid for Aer Lingus. The bid now looks dead in the water 
ISEQ plummets 120pts on weak DOLLAR
after Aer Lingus's employee share ownership trust last week voted against it. The vote means that the anti-Ryanair 
camp owns 46.6pc of Aer Lingus, making it virtually impossible for Ryanair to reach more than 50pc of the flag 
carrier. Michael O'Leary said that Ryanair would not be increasing its E2.80 bid. Shares in Aer Lingus were 
unchanged on 2.68 in Dublin today. Other notable movers included drinks group C&C, down 6c to 11.60, Elan, 
down 25c to 11.15, and Kerry Group, down 16c to 19.29. Shares in Donegal Creameries were up 19c to 4.80, while 
ICON jumped 60c to 29.00. Veris, formerly Irish Estates, closed 20c higher on 4.75.

You are on your way to the airport, flying out for a meeting that could make or break your career - even your 
company. Then the traffic closes in and your taxi gets stuck in a full-on, bumper-to- bumper jam. That familiar 
feeling of dread fills your stomach and by the time it rises to your head you know you're not going to make it. Either 
you fret and then flail around with your phone, or you slide back in your seat and allow yourself to have a silly 
thought: never mind, the plane will wait for me.
Well, soon it will.
At least that's the promise of a company that is serious about turning your silly thought into a business proposition. 
If everything goes to plan, in 2009 JetBird will start operating Europe's first low-cost, on-demand private jet service. 
And on its website it promises, among other things, that: "If you are stuck in traffic or held up in a meeting, we will 
wait for you."
The man behind this venture is no fantasist who has spent too much time in the back of a cab in traffic thinking up 
ways to make money from his (and everyone else's) misfortune. In fact, Domhnal Slattery has already made 
millions in aviation - and he's not even 40 yet. He reckons he can do it again.
Slattery hasn't revealed exactly how many tens of millions of euros he received by selling his aviation advisory 
business, IAMG, to Royal Bank of Scotland in 2001. But he believes he has found a way to repeat his success by 
making the glamorous world of private jet travel available to the "mass affluent" of Europe.
There is something familiar about the style, about the easy eloquence of the man as he flips rapidly through his 
presentation charts over breakfast at a fashionable boutique hotel in the shadow of London's Telecom Tower. It's 
that Irish thing. Slattery learnt the trade at GPA, formerly Guinness Peat Aviation, the pioneering aircraft leasing 
company led by the legendary Tony Ryan, which acted as a business school for a generation of bright young 
Irishmen in the 1980s. It was Ryan too who gave us Ryanair and that other Irish airline entrepreneur Michael

O'Leary. It must be something in the water. But whatever it is, Slattery has always been a bit of prodigy - he joined 
GPA as trading-floor officer, what he calls the lowest rung on the management ladder, at just 22.
This is Slattery's proposition: Europe has a bigger population than the US, while incomes are expanding at similar 
rates on both side of the north Atlantic. There are 2.8 million individuals in Europe with assets of more than Dollars 
1m - roughly similar to the 2.9 million in the US, according to the latest Merrill Lynch/Capgemini world wealth report. 
Despite all that wealth, the number of corporate jets in Europe is still only 20 per cent of what it is in the US. Yet the 
hassle and inconvenience of European commercial air travel are just as great, and the attractions of travelling by 
private jet just as real.
Business aviation is already growing strongly around the world. The US is the heartland of the industry and 
accounts for three-quarters of the world fleet of business jets, but demand is now also flowing in from Europe, 
Russia, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
Slattery believes private jet travel is now poised to make the next big leap, with a new generation of cheaper jets 
coming on to the market - and he wants JetBird to be first mover in Europe.
He knows a thing or two about the business. In 1994, a year after Jack Welch's GE Capital bought GPA (now GE 
Capital Aviation Services), Slattery moved out and set up his own business, crossing the fence to advise airlines on 
their dealings with leasing companies and banks, first in Latin America and then around the globe. When he sold 
his company to Royal Bank of Scotland, IAMG was underwriting and arranging Dollars 1bn of business annually.
He has remained a non-executive director at RBS Aviation Capital, but the day-to-day focus of his activities is 
Claret Capital, a Dublin-based private investment company formed to manage the private wealth of four Irish 
families, including the Slattery fortune. Claret Capital has moved into property and private equity, but along the way 
Slattery has been unable to resist the pull of aviation.
Across Europe and the US, start-up ventures - often called air-taxi or air-limousine services - are emerging, taking 
advantage of the newest arrival on the business jet scene, so-called very light jets (VLJs). "The economic model for 
(private) jet travel is about to change, because of the dramatically reduced costs per seat mile these aircraft offer," 
says Jack Pelton, chief executive of Cessna Aircraft, a subsidiary of the US company Textron. Advances in small jet 
engines and avionics, and higher-volume production rates will make VLJs cheaper to buy and run. "This change in 
economics will allow today's air charter and fractional operators to lower their costs and attract a whole new market 
to their services," Pelton says.
Some of the first models, such as the Eclipse 500 and the Cessna Mustang, have recently received certification 
from the US Federal Aviation Authority, clearing the way for deliveries.
Ronald Epstein, a research analyst at Merrill Lynch, says private aviation is evolving "from a luxury of the highest-
paid corporate jet-setters to something more of a tool used by mid-level managers and the upper middle class."
JetBird will be based in Switzerland. As the fleet grows, the plan is that further bases will be developed in Germany, 
France, the UK and Italy. Data from Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control organisation, show how most 
business aviation traffic in Europe is concentrated roughly along a London-Rome axis, taking in Paris, Geneva, 
Cannes and Milan.
Slattery believes he will be able to offer a traditional private- jet premium service but at a much lower price: one 
comparable to current business-class travel and costing less than 50 per cent of existing branded private jet 
services.
JetBird will be able to operate to and from more than 800 European destinations, with flights typically of 60-90 
minutes duration. Customers will be able to book flights online, by phone or through travel companies, and they will 
be able to book on a flight-by- flight basis or through a pre-paid membership card. Flights will be charged by the 
hour with the flat hourly rate including take-off and landing charges.
The only way is up Domhnal Slattery's JetBird is just one of a slew of businesses hoping that a new breed of 
mini-jets will make private air travel more afforda....
Slattery maintains that JetBird's hourly charges will be around half of those levied by NetJets, the biggest operator 
of private jets, owned by legendary investor Warren Buffett. A JetBird customer will have sole use of the aircraft 
once booked and will not have to share it - although additional passengers can be added to your flight booking for a 
small premium per person. He says that, for three colleagues or members of a family flying together, the shared 
cost will typically be less than the cost of each travelling business class.
JetBird has ordered 50 of the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer's Phenom 100 aircraft and has options for another 
50. First delivery is in April 2009. At Dollars 2.85m (at January 2005 prices), the Phenom 100 will seat four 
passengers and have a range of 1,160 nautical miles (2,148km).
On the other side of the Atlantic, Florida-based DayJet aims to start a similar service early next year from five 
Florida cities. It is also eyeing the European market.
Amid all the froth of a rapidly rising market the world of business aviation is beginning to offer some uncomfortable 
reminders of the years when the dotcom bubble was inflating: new business models, seemingly endless demand 
stretching to a blue horizon, paradigm shifts in behaviour.
And some of the biggest operators clearly cannot help themselves. Buffett famously bought NetJets because he 
used the service himself and loved it. Yet it was this same Warren Buffett who famously warned students in the 
early 1990s of the financial dangers of falling in love with flight, given airlines' unfailing ability to destroy rather than 
add value. ("If you had been down there at Kitty Hawk, and you had seen this guy go up, and all of a sudden this 
vision hit you that tens of millions of people would be doing this all over the world one day and that it would bring us 
all closer together, (you would) think, my God, this is something to be in on. But if there had been a capitalist down 
there, the guy would have shot down Wilbur (and Orville Wright in 1903). You know, 'one small step for mankind, 
one huge step backwards for capitalism'.")
Despite operating a fleet of hundreds of business jets across north America and increasingly in Europe, NetJets has 
struggled to make money. In his latest annual letter to shareholders earlier this year Buffett was forced to confess: 
"I said last year that this business would earn money in 2005 - and I was dead wrong."
Buffett appears to remain relaxed about the losses, however, and is irredeemably hooked on the private-jet 
experience. "Once a customer has tried us, going back to commercial aviation is like going back to holding hands," 
he told his shareholders.
As the world of private jets expands, many new actors are being attracted to the scene. One of them is Ricky 
Sitomer, who made his first millions as a Wall Street broker during the dotcom boom.
Seated in the gilded foyer of London's Dorchester Hotel recently, he laid out his plans to open a London office and 
begin to tap the UK market. This will be his first move outside the US, where he claims to have become the largest 
broker of private jets in little more than five years. "We had a great run (as Wall Street brokers), but then the market 
tanked. We were tech-heavy. We had to decide, did we want to rebuild or go to another growth business? We 
chose a growth industry."
When the times were hot on Wall Street, Sitomer liked to offer his star employees private-jet travel to Las Vegas or 
Atlantic City as incentive rewards - but often he was unable to find the right aircraft at the right time. The business 
idea was born.
"We ran in circles with other people that used private jets. Of our contemporaries more and more were flying 
privately. We were aware of the potential demand."
He now claims a workforce of 250 salesmen at his brokerage, Blue Star Jets, spread across offices in New York, 
Los Angeles, Boca Raton, Miami and Chicago, and says he is looking for between 50 and 100 sales people in 
London.
The only way is up Domhnal Slattery's JetBird is just one of a slew of businesses hoping that a new breed of 
mini-jets will make private air travel more afforda....
"We are in the personal luxury and lifestyle business. We like personal service," he says. "Our representatives 
organise everything, including the food onboard and the flowers for the wife."
The brashness of Blue Star's approach has not endeared Sitomer to some of his much longer-established rivals, 
but he is unapologetic. He even took the name for his company from the movie Wall Street, in which Michael 
Douglas's character Gordon Gekko, a power-hungry corporate raider, seeks to buy an airline called Blue Star using 
inside information. Gekko, typified by his "greed is good" speech, was supposed to be the villain of the piece, but 
appears to have become an inspiration for a generation of Wall Street brokers. "We did like the movie," says 
Sitomer. "We are from Wall Street. We chose (the name) for brand recognition. It is ironic -well, Michael Douglas 
liked it. Our name has become synonymous with service and great luxury. I don't think I will regret it."
Sitomer claims access as a broker to more than 3,500 private jets in the US, and he believes charter or jet-card 
membership schemes will lure customers away from fractional ownership companies such as NetJets, because 
they do not involve the same level of long- term, financial commitment.
"My goal is having the woman taking tea in Palm Beach saying not that she flew in a Gulfstream G550, but that she 
flew Blue Star as a luxury status symbol."

Having just sold Euros 24m of Ryanair shares, one wonders why Michael O'Leary, its chief executive, bothers going 
into the office. Yet his enthusiasm for the job and for taking over Ryanair's Irish rival Aer Lingus seems undimmed. 
Now that Aer Lingus employees have rejected Ryanair's Euros 2.80-a-share bid, though, he is unlikely to succeed.
This battle may be over but the war is not. Ryanair still owns 19 per cent of Aer Lingus, mostly bought at Euros 2.42 
a share. This makes it unlikely that any alternative bid will materialise. Aer Lingus's shares will also be illiquid, with 
nearly two-thirds in the hands of employees, the government and Ryanair. Assuming Ryanair's offer lapses on 
December 22, it can bid again in a year's time. Until then, it can buy more Aer Lingus shares at below Euros 2.80. 
These closed yesterday at Euros 2.68.
European competition authorities will issue a preliminary judgment on the bid by December 6. Even if further 
investigation is recommended, Ryanair will gain useful information on what remedies might be imposed if a bid 
were successful.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus's management will be under severe pressure. Investors will require share price increases; 
unions may feel less supportive if costs are squeezed; and the management must start to deliver on a demanding 
business plan. It is difficult not to feel that, while Aer Lingus now has the worst of both worlds, Ryanair has the best.

It is that blissful few minutes between the duty-free trolley and the sale of scratchcards. Wedged into a seat, you 
somehow manage to drift into sleep. But then you are woken by a chilling sound. Is an engine falling off? No, the 
Crazy Frog ringtone has invaded the skies.
If Ryanair and Emirates can manage it - and both the highly profitable low-cost airline and its luxury peer rarely get 
it wrong - this will be a familiar scene from the middle of next year. While a number of airlines are lukewarm on the 
wisdom of allowing passengers to use mobile phones in the air, the pair intend to plunge straight into commercial 
use of new technology in 2007 that will cause the last bastion of phone-free peace to be invaded.
As well as an opportunity to get one over on its bigger rivals, Ryanair also sees phones as a platform for in-flight 
entertainment and gambling to generate additional revenues. "If you want a quiet flight, use another airline," said 
Michael O'Leary, the company's chief executive, when he announced the new service in August. "Ryanair is noisy, 
full and we are always trying to sell you something."
For technology lovers, the ever-forceful O'Leary and the providers of the service have a point. Why on earth do you 
have to be earthbound to make mobile phone calls, compose crucial BlackBerry messages or surf the web?
But in spite of the growing spread of phones and personal digital assistants, finding a successful business model for 
airline technology has proved elusive. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, gambled on in-flight passenger 
communications and lost spectacularly. Airlines dropped orders for its Connexion broadband service in cost-cutting 
exercises after the September 11 attacks. Those that stayed faithful - such as Boeing's most committed Connexion 
customer, Lufthansa, will be left high and dry at the end of the year when the manufacturer pulls the plug.
Passengers who need to make important calls already can, of course - although it is generally expensive, requires a 
credit card, and they cannot receive in-bound calls.
Let us bray One of the last havens from daft ringtones and inane conversations is about to be lost as airlines 
bring in technology to allow passengers to use mo....
Like Boeing, other pioneers in in-flight communications have failed to find enough passengers willing to pay 
premium prices for the services. Verizon Communications said in June that it would cancel its US Airfone product, 
which costs passengers calling fixed lines Dollars 3.99 to connect and Dollars 4.99 per minute.
But if the story of in-flight telephony is not one of steady progress, 2007 is still likely to prove a landmark year as 
competing operators look to pick up where Boeing and Verizon gave up. The new entrants' belief is that those 
frequent fliers who shied away from the hassle and expense of previous products will be unable to resist the 
prospect of using their own phones and paying a modest charge to their own bills.
The OnAir consortium will test its service allowing mobile phone calls at a normal roaming rate in January before 
providing it to Ryanair's fleet in the second half of the year. Broadband internet access is expected to follow close 
behind, although not at the high speeds that Connexion offered.
Meanwhile, Dubai-based Emirates is pioneering the competing AeroMobile system on a Boeing 777 in January. 
Inmarsat, the satellite operator that provides the backbone for both the new mobile phone services and part of the 
established fixed phone market, said that lower prices and charging via mobile phone bills rather than credit cards 
would make a big difference. "People never really used (the fixed phones)," admits Paul Griffith, vice- president at 
Inmarsat. "(Now) the roaming rates will be equivalent to if you were travelling to France or Germany."
The industry is alive to concerns that chirruping mobile phones could be a cause of air rage. Both AeroMobile and 
OnAir's systems give the crew the power to prevent passengers from making calls at night, although a "silent mode" 
will allow insomniacs to check their BlackBerrys or send text messages.
The ground-based mobile operators see the services as a possible revenue generator but are concerned about 
possible interference with mobile communications on the ground. It is partly for this reason that flight crew solemnly 
warn passengers to turn off their mobile phones for the duration of the flight with the implicit threat that it could bring 
down the aircraft. While the risk of mobile phones obstructing avionics equipment is not imaginary, it is widely 
thought to be overblown. "Although the use of mobile phones on aircraft has not been permitted due to safety 
concerns, it appears that for every eight or 10 passengers on an aircraft there will be one mobile phone left on, very 
often in luggage that cannot be easily accessed," says Chris Kemp, regulatory director at Ericsson, the handset 
maker. "Such active mobile phones do not appear to have any impact on avionic systems." In any case, it is a 
primary area of concern for regulators as they examine whether to approve different systems.
Even if large numbers of passengers are making and receiving telephone calls and sending e-mails by the end of 
next year, there will still be one significant gap: the US. Regulators are yet to be convinced of the benefits of lifting a 
ban on the use of mobile phones and any US services in commercial airliners are not expected before 2008. To 
look on the bright side, passengers flying over the country will be spared the Crazy Frog for the foreseeable future.

AIR FRANCE - KLM REPORTS 30% INCREASE IN OPERATING PROFITS
AIR FRANCE-KLM REPORTS 30% INCREASE IN OPERATING PROFITS

Body
The airline, formed in 2004 through Air France's takeover of KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, forecast a "significant 
increase" in operating profits for the full year despite a sharp downturn in the profitability of its cargo operations in 
the second quarter.
Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chairman and chief executive, said the group was pressing ahead with its planned launch of a 
low-cost airline subsidiary in France in order to take a share of the growing short-haul leisure market.
The group has previously stood aloof from the fast-growing low-cost airline sector in Europe. However, it is facing 
growing competition from a number of no-frills operators, led by EasyJet and Ryanair and including more recent 
start-ups such as Spain's Vueling, which are gradually building a presence in the French market despite problems 
in gaining take-off and landing slots - in particular, at the two main Paris airports.
Air France-KLM reported a 30.5 per cent increase in operating profits from Euros 750m to Euros 979m (Dollars 
1.27bn) in the first half, although operating profits rose by only 7.8 per cent in the second quarter to Euros 568m.
Group turnover rose by 10.3 per cent, from Euros 10.8bn to Euros 11.9bn, in the first half, as the group benefited 
from the strong increase in demand for air travel in particular from premium passengers on long-haul routes.
Air France-KLM said that its operating margin had risen by1.2 percentage points to 9.1 per cent in the first half, one 
of the best performances among European carriers.
The group is gaining market share in European long-haul traffic through its strengthened network based on its Paris 
Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol airport hubs created by the merger of the French and Dutch airlines.
It said it had again raised its target for revenue and cost synergies to be gained from the merger, which were 
expected to reach Euros 1bn by 2010-11, up from Euros 605m in 2007-08.
AIR FRANCE - KLM REPORTS 30% INCREASE IN OPERATING PROFITS
The group was spending about Euros 100m a year on the development of joint information technology systems with 
a key move planned in 2007 with the transfer by KLM to the same Amadeus reservations system used by Air 
France.

Highlight: The Irish Takeover Panel today ruled that Aer Lingus broke takeover rules.
Body
The Irish Takeover Panel today ruled that Aer Lingus has broken takeover rules. 
It said that 2007 earnings plus the imputed multiple referred to in a recent circular to shareholders constituted a 
profit forecast under Irish takeover rules. 
The circular relates to its defence against a hostile takeover bid from Ryanair.
 Aer Lingus said it was not its intention that this reference be regarded as a profit forecast and it has been 
withdrawn. The intention was to illustrate that the offer made by Ryanair values Aer Lingus at a significant discount 
to Ryanair and Aer Lingus' European peer group, Aer Lingus said. Separately, the Irish Takeover Panel has ruled 
that Aer Lingus must publish details of its Process Improvement Programme, part of its takeover defence, by Dec 1. 
The panel said the recent Aer Lingus response circular contained the claim that 'we are continuing to drive unit cost 
efficiencies and will write to you with details of our 2007 Process Improvement Programme in due course.

Air France-KLM said Thursday that fiscal second-quarter profit rose 26 percent, but shares of Europe's biggest 
airline fell as much as 8 percent after it announced tentative talks on a tie-up with Alitalia.
Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta said Air France-KLM had begun discussions on a possible combination with 
Italy's unprofitable state-controlled national airline, as his company posted net profit of 374 million euros ($482 
million) for the July to September quarter, buoyed by strong passenger traffic.
That compares with 298 million euros in the same quarter a year ago, excluding a 419 million euros gain from the 
sale of a stake in the Amadeus flight booking system. When the sale proceeds are included in the year-earlier 
figure, however, quarterly net profit fell 48 percent.
Spinetta said the discussions with Alitalia would focus on the Italian airline's financial situation, the merger 
synergies possible and the compatibility of the two carriers' strategies.
"Only if we have positive answers to these three points will we open merger talks with Alitalia," he said.
Shares of Air France-KLM Group fell as much as 2.63 euros, or 8.2 percent, to 29.62 euros in Paris, while in Milan, 
Alitalia SpA shares rose as much as 5.2 percent to 0.99 euro.
In a separate statement later in the day, the Franco-Dutch airline underlined that the merger discussions had been 
initiated "at Alitalia's request" and were at the stage of "exploratory talks."
Ever since Rome lobbied unsuccessfully for Alitalia to be included in the 2004 Air France-KLM merger, Spinetta has 
said he would consider a tie-up with the Italian carrier once it had restructured and returned to profit.
Even so, the timing of the discussions was "puzzling," Paris-based analysts Edmund Shing of Kepler Equities said.
"It doesn't make sense and is not good," Shing said. Italy's national carrier "is still not profitable and hasn't sorted 
out its problems."
Air France - KLM shares drop on possible merger with unprofitable Alitalia
Alitalia has not turned a profit in four years and last week reported a third-quarter pretax loss of 65.8 million euros 
($84.8 million).
The talks come amid consolidation moves across the industry. Last week, U.S. Airways Group Inc. made an $8.8 
billion bid for Delta Air Lines Inc. Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has also made a $1.9 billion bid for 
rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, although the hostile offer is seen as unlikely to succeed.
Air France-KLM reiterated its previous full-year forecast of a "significant rise" in operating profit, declining to be 
more specific.
Revenue rose 8.8 percent to 6.13 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in the second quarter from 5.64 billion euros a year-
earlier.
Dow Jones Newswires correspondent Greg Keller in Paris contributed to this report.

That compares with 298 million euros in the same quarter a year ago, excluding a 419 million euros gain from the 
sale of a stake in the Amadeus flight booking system. When the sale proceeds are included in the year-earlier 
figure, however, quarterly net profit fell 48 percent.
Spinetta said the discussions with Alitalia would focus on the Italian airline's financial situation, the merger 
synergies possible and the compatibility of the two carriers' strategies.
"Only if we have positive answers to these three points will we open merger talks with Alitalia," he said.
Shares of Air France-KLM Group fell as much as 2.63 euros, or 8.2 percent, to 29.62 euros in Paris, while in Milan, 
Alitalia SpA shares rose as much as 5.2 percent to 0.99 euro.
In a separate statement later in the day, the Franco-Dutch airline underlined that the merger discussions had been 
initiated "at Alitalia's request" and were at the stage of "exploratory talks."
Ever since Rome lobbied unsuccessfully for Alitalia to be included in the 2004 Air France-KLM merger, Spinetta has 
said he would consider a tie-up with the Italian carrier once it had restructured and returned to profit.
Even so, the timing of the discussions was "puzzling," Paris-based analysts Edmund Shing of Kepler Equities said.
"It doesn't make sense and is not good," Shing said. Italy's national carrier "is still not profitable and hasn't sorted 
out its problems."
Air France - KLM shares drop on possible merger with unprofitable Alitalia
Alitalia has not turned a profit in four years and last week reported a third-quarter pretax loss of 65.8 million euros 
($84.8 million).
The talks come amid consolidation moves across the industry. Last week, U.S. Airways Group Inc. made an $8.8 
billion bid for Delta Air Lines Inc. Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has also made a $1.9 billion bid for 
rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, although the hostile offer is seen as unlikely to succeed.

Air France-KLM said Thursday that fiscal second-quarter profit rose 26 percent, but shares of Europe's biggest 
airline fell as much as 8.2 percent after it announced tentative talks on a tie-up with Alitalia.
Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta said Air France-KLM had begun discussions on a possible combination with 
Italy's unprofitable state-controlled national airline, as his company posted net profit of €374 million (US$482 
million) for July-September, buoyed by strong passenger traffic.
That compares with €298 million in the year-earlier quarter, excluding a €419 million gain from the sale of a stake in 
the Amadeus flight booking system. When the sale proceeds are included in the year-earlier figure, however, 
quarterly net profit fell 48 percent. Net profit per share fell to €1.30 (US$1.68) from €2.52.
Spinetta said the discussions with Alitalia would focus on the Italian airline's financial situation, the merger 
synergies possible and the compatibility of the two carriers' strategies.
"Only if we have positive answers to these three points will we open merger talks with Alitalia," he said.
Shares of Air France-KLM Group fell as much as €2.63 (US$3.39), or 8.2 percent, to €29.62 in Paris, while in Milan,

Air France-KLM Group shares fell as much as 8.2 percent after the airlines said it is in exploratory merger talks with 
Alitalia SpA, the unprofitable Italian state-controlled carrier.
Separately, Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline, said strong passenger growth helped net profit to rise by a 
quarter in July-September, excluding a one-time gain from an asset sale in the year-earlier quarter.
The company, created in a 2004 merger between the national carriers of France and the Netherlands, posted fiscal 
second-quarter net profit of €374 million (US$482 million), compared with €298 million (US$384 million) in the same 
period a year earlier. The figures exclude the impact of the sale of a stake in the Amadeus flight reservations 
system.
Air France-KLM also reiterated its previous full-year forecast of a "significant rise in operating income."
Spinetta said Air France-KLM had begun discussions on a possible merger with Alitalia that would focus on the 
Italian airline's financial situation, the merger synergies possible and the compatibility of the two carriers' strategies.
"Only if we have positive answers to these three points will we open merger talks with Alitalia," Spinetta said.
Rome lobbied unsuccessfully for Alitalia to be included in the 2004 Air France-KLM merger, and Spinetta has 
consistently said he would consider a tie-up once the Italian carrier was profitable.
Shares of Air France-KLM fell as much as 8.2 percent to €29.62 (US$38.15) in Paris, while in Milan, Alitalia shares 
rose as much as 5.2 percent to 99 euro cents (US$1.28).

The Dublin market fell back this morning as investors pocketed yesterday's gains from construction shares.
At midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 37.83 points to 8866.60.
CRH was the main faller of the morning session, falling 40c to 29.13, while Kingspan slipped 20c to 17.40. Also in 
the construction sector, McInerney fell 15c to 13.00. Grafton was down 5c to 11.40.
 Banking shares fared marginally better, with Irish Life and Permanent up 15c to 20.15 and Anglo Irish Bank up 10c 
to 14.45. However, AIB was down 10c to 21.75, while Bank of Ireland fell 5c to 16.25. With Ryanair's bid for Aer 
Lingus now looking dead in the water, shares fell 1c to 9.73 in Dublin this morning. It was announced yesterday that 
members of the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust Limited (ESOT) voted 97pc to reject Ryanair's offer. 
The vote was seen as crucial in deciding whether the offer would be accepted. The result means that it is now 
virtually impossible for Ryanair to reach more than 50pc. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 1c to 2.66. Other notable 
movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, down 15c to 15.40, Kerry Group, down 10cto 19.40, and Irish 
Continental Group, down 16c to 12.71. United Drug tacked on 1c to 3.71 after it reported on Thursday, pre-tax 
profits of E55.2m for the year ending September 2006, up 14pc from the previous year and slightly ahead of 
forecasts. United Drug said that 2006 represented another 'significant milestone' in the development of the 
company. The company added that is looking for more bolt-on deals to follow a number of purchases recently of 
endoscopy and drugs distributors.

A sluggish Dublin market closed virtually unchanged today despite sharp gains in Anglo Irish Bank as it prepares to 
publish its full year results at the start of next month.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 4.93 points lower on 8899.50.
Anglo Irish Bank is due to announce its results on 6 December. Dolmen Securities analyst, Stuart Draper, has 
forecast profit before tax and earnings per share of E860m and E0.95 respectively, representing year on year 
growth of 40pc and 34pc. He said such a result would be around 4pc stronger than consensus forecasts.
 Elsewhere in the banking sector, Irish Life and Permanent was up 16c to 20.16, while AIB fell 15c to 21.85. Bank of 
Ireland was unchanged on 16.30. The market lacked direction due to the Wall Street Thanksgiving holiday, dealers 
said. Construction shares weighed heavy on the market after recording sharp gains on Wednesday. Grafton was 
the main faller, down 25c to 11.20, while CRH slipped 18c to 29.35. Kingspan also closed in the red, down 15c to 
17.45, with McInerney unchanged on 13.15. Despite its bid for Aer Lingus now looking dead in the water, shares in 
no-frills airline Ryanair closed 3c higher on 9.77 today. It was announced on Wednesday that members of the Aer 
Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust Limited (ESOT) voted 97pc to reject Ryanair's offer. The vote was seen 
as crucial in deciding whether the offer would be accepted. The result means that it is now virtually impossible for 
Ryanair to reach more than 50pc. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 3c to 2.68. Other notable movers included 
bookmaker Paddy Power, down 15c to 15.40, Kerry Group, down 10cto 19.40, and Irish Continental Group, down 
16c to 12.71. United Drug tacked on 1c to 3.71 after it announced on Wednesday that pre-tax profits hit E55.2m in 
the year ending September 2006. The figures were up 14pc from the previous year and slightly ahead of forecasts. 
United Drug said that 2006 represented another 'significant milestone' in the development of the company. The 
company added that is looking for more bolt-on deals to follow a number of purchases recently of endoscopy and 
drugs distributors. Greencore performed strongly again after Cork County Council confirmed it has been in 
discussions with the firm over its plans for the future of the former sugar plant at Mallow. Greencore said earlier this 
ISEQ flat despite gains in Anglo Irish
week that it was planning a E1.1 billion development of its site in Carlow. It is believed to be trying to have the 300-
acre site rezoned from industrial to commercial and residential use. Shares were up 8c to 4.20 in Dublin this 
evening. Other notable movers included Dragon Oil, which tacked on over 10pc to 2.69, up 25c, Pharmaceutical 
group Elan, down 12c to 11.38, and Kerry Group, up 9c to 19.59. Meanwhile, diagnostic products manufacturer 
Trinity Biotech added on 5c to 1.80.

Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) hostile bid for Aer Lingus has been rebuffed by staff, with 97 per cent of the 
former state airline's employee share ownership trust (Esot) rejecting the offer in a ballot of its 4,666 members
Esot owns 12.58 per cent. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has long argued that without the trust's 
backing the Ryanair bid was unlikely to succeed.
Bernard Harbor, spokesman for Impact, the union representing cabin crew, pilots and middle managers, said: "I 
doubt if they would have voted for Michael O'Leary as boss at any price."
Given opposition from the Irish government, with 25 per cent, two pilots bodies with 4 per cent and Denis O'Brien, 
an Irish businessman with 2.1 per cent, some analysts assume the Ryanair bid is dead.
Ryanair, which acquired 19.2 per cent of Aer Lingus in the wake of its initial public offering in September, said on 
Tuesday it would not raise the offer of Euros 2.80 a share except where there was a counterbid from a white knight 
or where the Aer Lingus board recommended a higher Ryanair offer.
Advisers say Ryanair may be content to let the offer lapse and see Brussels rule in its favour over antitrust issues, 
knowing that in a year it would be able to mount another bid without the uncertainty of a possible regulatory 
challenge.
The Ryanair offer runs to December 4, when it lapses unless the company chooses to extend the offer period.
On December 6 the European Commission is to rule on whether the deal is big enough to trigger a full competition 
probe.
Aer Lingus shares closed down 5 cents last night at Euros 2.61, or lower than the offer price.

However, hedge funds have been buying shares and appear not to have ruled out the possibility of an increased 
offer.
Separately Mr O'Leary disclosed he had sold 2.5m shares in Ryanair at Euros 9.70. He still owns 32.5m, or 4.2 per 
cent of the equity.

David Bonderman, the founding partner of Texas Pacific Group, has never shirked from opportunistic interest in the 
airline industry, highlighted
by an audacious - if unsuccessful - effort to join a union-backed bid for Boeing's commercial aircraft business in 
2003.
The Texas-based businessman has proved an astute observer of the airline sector through a series of deals 
including the rescue of America West and Continental Airlines, and his identification of the potential now stamped 
on the European market by Ryanair, the fast-growing Irish low-cost carrier he now chairs.
However, TPG's interest comes amid signs that private equity groups are losing interest in the sector they once 
targeted because of strong profit growth outside the US and a shortage of aircraft that had prompted interest in 
leasing companies.
Mr Bonderman's influence in the industry was apparent when he addressed the International Air Transport 
Association last June. "It's time to sell, ladies and gentleman," he told his audience in Paris. "This is as good as it 
gets in the airline industry and it's only going to get worse."
He suggested there were limited opportunities in an industry which saw record orders last year, driven by rising 
demand from carriers in the Middle East and Asia, notably India and China. The peak, he said, had been reached.
Such "opportunities" included investment in Tiger Airways, a low-cost offshoot of Singapore Airlines backed by 
Indigo Partners, an investment vehicle including Mr Bonderman, Bill Franke, a former head of America West, and 
Tony Ryan, founder of Ryanair.

A pivotal shareholder in Aer Lingus Group PLC, the recently privatized Irish airline, overwhelmingly rejected a 
takeover bid Wednesday by rival Ryanair, dealing a mortal blow to the no-frills carrier's ambitious merger plan.
About 97 percent of the approximately 4,650 members of the Employee Share Ownership Trust voted to oppose a 
takeover by Ryanair Holdings PLC, the fastest-growing and most ruthlessly cost-cutting airline in Europe. The trust, 
which controls 12.6 percent of Aer Lingus on behalf of current and former employees, holds the effective balance of 
power between Ryanair and other shareholders hostile to the bid.
The rejection which was widely expected even by Ryanair executives further depressed shares in Aer Lingus, which 
fell 2 cents to close at €2.72 (US$3.52), nearly 3 percent lower than Ryanair's takeover offer of €2.80 (US$3.62) a 
share.
Labor union chiefs, who were influential in advising trust members to oppose the bid, said Aer Lingus employees 
were unlikely to support a Ryanair takeover at any price partly because they feared losing their quality of 
employment, and perhaps their very jobs.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has argued that a successful takeover would mean sizeable layoffs at Aer 
Lingus, a modestly profitable and growing airline that currently employs 3,200.
The trust's decision to join the openly anti-Ryanair camp the government, an Aer Lingus pilots' trust and pension 
fund, and Irish telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien means that shareholders formally opposing the bid have risen above 
45 percent. O'Leary has already conceded that Ryanair cannot acquire more than 50 percent of shares, the 
minimum required for a takeover, without support from the trust.
Ryanair stunned Ireland Oct. 5 when it launched its surprise bid, barely a week after the Irish government had 
floated most of its holding on the Irish and British stock exchanges at a share price of €2.20 (US$2.85). At the time, 
Ryanair said it had bought 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares, but was legally restricted from buying more once the 
takeover plan sent Aer Lingus shares soaring above the bid price.
Key Aer Lingus shareholder rejects takeover bid by Ryanair , effectively killing deal
Aer Lingus in recent weeks has steadily retreated from its record high of €3.05 (US$3.94) as investors discounted 
Ryanair's chances of success. Traders say Ryanair has not tried to build its holding since the Aer Lingus slipped 
back below €2.80 two weeks ago.
But Ryanair says it will retain its 19.2 percent slice of Aer Lingus if only to block any other potential suitor, such as 
British Airways, from seizing control of Aer Lingus and gaining a strong foothold in Ireland.
Meanwhile, O'Leary announced to the Irish Stock Exchange that he sold 2.5 million shares in Ryanair on Tuesday 
for €24.3 million (US$31.4 million). O'Leary retained more than 32.5 million Ryanair shares, a 4.2 percent stake 
worth more than €316.5 million (US$409.3 million).
The sale didn't dent the value of Ryanair, which rose 4 cents, or 0.3 percent, to close Wednesday at €9.74 
(US$12.60).

The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 14.36 points higher on 8904.43, having been as high as 8936.33.
Across the Atlantic, stocks on Wall Street endured a volatile start to the last session before the Thanksgiving 
Holiday, with data showing consumer sentiment falling and jobless claims rising, offsetting strong earnings from 
Dell.
 Back in Dublin, Kingspan was the star performer climbing 50c to 17.60, while CRH jumped 22c to 29.40 after the 
Architectural Billings Index, which is a nine to twelve month leading indicator of US non-residential construction 
activity, came in at 51.1 in October. Although this was down slightly from the 51.4 recorded in September, 
Goodbody Stockbrokers said it was "crucially above 50", which indicates confidence in the sector. Elsewhere in the 
sector, McInerney tacked on 5c to 13.15, while Grafton tacked on 7c to end the day at 11.50. Financial shares were 
largely in the black, with AIB up 14c to 22.00 and Irish Life & Permanent up 10c to 20.00. However, Anglo Irish bank 
fell 4c to 14.36 as it prepares to release its full year results on 6 December, while Bank of Ireland, down 18c to 
16.30, was hit by profit taking after it issued strong third quarter results last week. Shares in Aer Lingus tumbled 
again today after Members of the Employee Share Ownership Trust, which own 12pc of the airline, voted by a 
majority of 97pc to reject the takeover bid from Ryanair. This vote, seen as crucial in deciding whether the offer will 
succeed, means that the anti-Ryanair camp own 46.6pc making it virtually impossible for Ryanair to get more than 
50pc of Aer Lingus. The results came hot on the heels of Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary announcing on 
Tuesday that Ryanair would not be increasing its E2.80 per share offer for the flag carrier. Under stock market rules 
this means that he cannot bid again for Aer Lingus for 12 months. Aer Lingus closed 3c lower on 2.65 today. 
Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair added 2c to 9.74 after Michael O'Leary confirmed he had cut his stake in Europe's 
largest no-frills airline to 4.2pc. A disclosure to the stock exchange revealed he sold 2.5m shares at E9.70 a share, 
ISEQ closes higher, but off day highs
taking his holding to 32.5m shares. Other notable movers included South Wharf, down 7c to 6.70, DCC, up 25c to 
24.05, and FBD Holdings, up 46c to 41.30. However, pharmaceutical group Elan managed to buck the trend, falling 
21c to 11.53 on profit taking. Shares in Greencore were in the black again after it announced earlier in the week 
that it has submitted plans to build a E1.1bn town centre on the site of one of its former sugar factories in Carlow. 
Included in the plan are 3,000 residential units, retail facilities and a 50-acre business park on the 330-acre former 
Irish Sugar factory in the town. Greencore has put its project before Carlow County Council for its consideration. 
Shares added 2c to 4.12 today.

Construction shares led the Dublin market towards a new record closing high today as the ISEQ continued its 
recent surge to move ever closer to the 9000 level.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 29.01 points to 8919.08, having been as high as 8936.33.
Kingspan was the star performer climbing 40c to 17.50, while CRH jumped 37c to 29.55 after the Architectural

tumbled again today after Ryanair said yesterday that it would not up its bid for the former state airline. Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O'Leary ruled out any increase in its E2.80-a-share offer for Aer Lingus which, under 
takeover rules, means it cannot increase its offer for 12 months. Meanwhile, the ESOT ballot, which will effectively

Macquarie-led team targets Qantas in buy-out approach
Macquarie-led team targets Qantas in buy-out approach

Body
Qantas, Australia's dominant airline, has received a preliminary approach to take it private from a consortium led by 
Macquarie Bank and Texas Pacific Group, the US buy-out firm.
The Sydney-based carrier revealed the approach early today but said the discussions were at an early stage.
There has been market speculation for some days that Macquarie and Texas Pacific, the airline turnround specialist 
led by David Bonderman, have been preparing a bid of ADollars 5.20-ADollars 5.50 a share, valuing the airline at 
more than ADollars 10bn (Pounds 4.2bn). This compares with a closing price of ADollars 4.35, up 3.1 per cent, 
yesterday.
"The approach is confidential and incomplete and is being investigated by Qantas," the airline said in a brief 
statement.
Macquarie, the acquisitive Australian financial services and infrastructure management group, declined to 
comment.
A takeover of Qantas, an iconic Australian company and the world's second oldest airline, would be one of the 
highest-profile private equity deals of recent times and by far the biggest such deal in Australia.
Any deal would have to be structured to comply with the remaining foreign ownership limits on Qantas, which has 
nearly 40,000 employees and more than a 60 per cent share of Australia's domestic aviation market. Foreign 
ownership is capped at49 per cent, with any single investor restricted to a 25 per cent holding.
The approach is part of the flood of private equity interest in Australia. It follows two deals in the past month 
involving private equity worth ADollars 8.5bn in the media sector alone.
Macquarie-led team targets Qantas in buy-out approach
The potential deal would be one of the largest in which Macquarie, the world's biggest private infrastructure 
operator, has been involved. Through its listed funds arm, it already manages Sydney Airport, which includes a 
Qantas terminal, and has a long history of involvement in aircraft leasing and financing.
Although Qantas, which was privatised from 1993, has ranked as one of the world's most profitable and best-run 
airlines, its shares have been held back by the uncertainties facing the global sector and have underperformed local 
benchmarks.
Mr Bonderman, a veteran of the private equity industry and chairman of Ryanair, the European low-cost carrier, 
also has substantial experience in the airline sector, notably helping engineer the turnround at US Airways in which 
TPG invested in 2002.

Ryanair is planning to open 20 new routes in Italy next year, chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
He told a news conference in Rome that Ryanair is committed to expansion in the Italian market and may "open up

The airline already uses three 'hub' airports in Italy to station aircraft and personnel and flies to 21 destinations.
 Mr O'Leary said most of the new routes will be to international destinations.

The ballot of Aer Lingus employee share ownership trust (ESOT) members take place today with Ryanair's Michael 
O'Leary warning that Aer Lingus' share price would collapse if his bid for the airline fails.
In a letter posted to all shareholders yesterday, O'Leary said he will not be increasing the E2.80 per share offer the 
former State-owned carrier.
"We do not believe there is anything in the Aer Lingus defence document to sustain any prospect of the current 
management of Aer Lingus delivering a share price of E2.80 or better. We believe that the markets share this view 
given the current share price is already below the Ryanair offer," Mr O'Leary said.
 Mr O'Leary again challenged Aer Lingus management on how it can claim the E2.80 offer undervalues the 
business when it was floated on the stock market at E2.20. In the letter, Mr O'Leary heavily criticised Aer Lingus 
management, accusing them of lacking "vision" for the future of the business.

Ryanair has to respect noise rules with its flights to Rome's Ciampino airport, Italy's transport minister Alessandro 
Bianchi said.
Bianchi was replying to reporters questions on a possible exclusion of Ryanair from using Ciampino because of 
complaints about noise from its flights.
'There is a problem of noise pollution. For the company, we have the maximum respect. However, it has to learn 
that flying and landing in Italian airports has to respect the rules,' he said.
 'This is not a pretext... For some time there are complaints in the area around Ciampino,' he said, without 
explaining further. Bianchi is a key minister working on turning around Alitalia SpA, which says it faces strong 
competition from low cost airlines. Ryanair today announced that it is planning to open 20 new routes in Italy next

"This is a ringing endorsement of the Union's call for the bid to be overwhelmingly rejected," said Mr. Halpenny.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, has told Aer Lingus shareholders that it does not plan to raise its Euros 
2.80 a share offer for its smaller Irish rival.
The Aer Lingus share price has traded below Euros 2.80 for the past two weeks as investors lost confidence in the 
bid succeeding.
It closed last night 9 cents lower at Euros 2.66, the lowest point since the bid was announced on October 5.
The result is due today of the ballot of members of the Aer Lingus employee share ownership trust (Esot), which 
holds a 12.58 per cent stake in theairline and is regarded as a key factor in determining the final outcome of the bid.
The Esot is expected to join the Irish government, which holds a 25.35 percent stake, and several smaller investor 
groupings in firmly rejecting the offer, which puts a value of Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) on the former state-owned 
airline.

The combative chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, mocked the directors of rival Aer Lingus and ruled out 
raising his takeover offer Tuesday in a letter to the shareholders of the recently privatized airline.
O'Leary warned that the price of Aer Lingus Group PLC would drop if Ryanair Holdings PLC abandoned its effort to 
take control of its main Irish competitor.
Aer Lingus' current direction does not justify a price exceeding Ryanair's offer of €2.80 (US$3.59) a share, O'Leary 
wrote. "Accordingly, Ryanair confirms that it will not increase its offer," he said in a 17-page letter, which is likely to 
be Ryanair's last effort to win backing from shareholders before a Dec. 4 deadline.
O'Leary, whose own aggressively marketed airline is the most rapidly growing and profitable in Europe, blasted the 
judgment and record of Aer Lingus directors. He said they were "not committed to delivering shareholder value" 
because they opposed Ryanair's approach in principle, and are "soft on staff costs" because they, unlike the cut-
throat Ryanair, were committed to negotiating with labor unions.
He said Aer Lingus' recent purchases and rentals of Airbus aircraft cost 40 percent more than Ryanair's bulk orders 
of Boeings. He said Aer Lingus had been hiring new staff, when it needed to be cutting its work force dramatically. 
Last year, he noted, Ryanair carried nearly five times as many passengers per employee.
Ryanair, which launched its takeover bid Oct. 5 barely a week after the Irish government sold most of its stake in 
the national carrier, bought 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus' shares before they rose above the €2.80 level. But it faces 
an uphill climb to secure the required 50 percent of shares by Dec. 4. Last week it admitted that just 0.12 percent of 
shareholders had responded positively to the offer.
The government, which has retained more than 25 percent of shares, also opposes the deal. So do the Aer Lingus 
pilots, who control more than 4.5 percent of shares, and Irish telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien who holds 2.1 percent.
Ryanair mocks Aer Lingus leaders in shareholder letter, rules out raising its takeover bid
On Wednesday the pivotal shareholder, the Employee Share Ownership Trust representing more than 4,600 
current and former Aer Lingus employees, is expected to announce the result of its internal ballot of members. 
O'Leary has already conceded that he requires support from the trust, which controls 12.6 percent of Aer Lingus, 
but probably won't get it.
Shares in both airlines dropped after the letter's publication. Aer Lingus fell 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at €2.70 
(US$3.46), while Ryanair was 13 cents lower, or 1.3 percent, at €9.72 (US$12.45), despite broadly positive trading 
Tuesday on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Stuart Draper, an analyst at Dolmen Stockbrokers in Dublin, said some investors still expected Ryanair to increase 
its bid price before Dec. 8, the deadline for Ryanair to present a revised offer. Were Ryanair to walk away, he said, 
Aer Lingus would be likely to fall back to the €2.50 (US$3.20) mark.

Stocks Hold Ground
NEW YORK (AP) Wall Street drifted in a narrow range Tuesday as investors paused from taking new positions in a 
holiday-shortened week even as shares of Google Inc. surpassed $500 for the first time. The hesitation by investors 
comes as Wall Street snapped a six-session winning streak on Monday, concerned that a recent run-up has driven 
some stocks too high. Big movements were not expected this week ahead of Thanksgiving, though retailers remain 
in focus ahead of one of the biggest shopping days of the year on Friday.
White House Lowers Economic Projections
WASHINGTON (AP) The White House on Tuesday lowered its forecast for economic growth this year and into 
2008, reflecting the drag from the housing slump. Even with the downgrade, though, the Bush administration is 
predicting that the unemployment rate will turn out to be slightly lower than previously thought.
Deere 4Q Profit Rises 19 Percent
MOLINE, Ill. (AP) Higher prices for farm and lawn-care equipment helped lift Deere & Co.'s fiscal fourth-quarter

slowdown over the next year. Deere chairman and chief executive officer Robert W. Lane said the company's

NEW YORK (AP) Oil prices climbed Tuesday amid temporary trouble with an Alaskan pipeline and a couple of U.S. 
refinery outages. Still, milder-than-normal U.S. temperatures and skepticism that OPEC members are committing to 
production cuts helped moderate the price increase.
Avis Budget Posts 3Q Loss Due to Charges
NEW YORK (AP) Avis Budget Group Inc. on Tuesday posted a $1.01 billion loss for the third quarter as the car 
rental company incurred substantial charges related to the breakup of its parent, the former conglomerate Cendant. 
The Parsippany, N.J.-based company posted a loss of $10.07 per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 
compared with year-ago earnings of $499 million, or $4.72 per share. The loss from continuing operations totaled 
$325 million versus earnings of $3 million a year earlier.
AK Steel's Mansfield Workers OK Contract
MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) Workers at AK Steel Holding Corp.'s Mansfield plant have approved a new four-year 
contract affecting about 300 hourly production and maintenance employees, the company said. The old contract 
with the United Steelworkers Local 169 was not due to expire until February. The new one was negotiated in less 
than a month, while company bargainers took a break from talks at its largest mill in Middletown, where about 2,500 
workers were locked out nearly nine months ago.
Google Shares Top $500 for 1st Time

rival Irish airline Aer Lingus and ruled out raising his takeover offer Tuesday in a letter to the shareholders of the 
recently privatized airline. O'Leary warned that the price of Aer Lingus Group PLC would drop if Ryanair abandoned

billion).
Ball Maker: Nike Move Could Cost Jobs
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) Nike Inc.'s decision to cancel orders from a Pakistan-based supplier of hand-stitched 
soccer balls due to labor violations could cost the company more than 4,000 jobs, its general manager said 
Tuesday. Saga Sports, which employs 8,000 to 9,000 people, exported products valued at 2 billion rupees (almost 
$33 million) last year, said the company's general manager, Rizwan Dar. He said soccer balls for Nike accounted 
for 70 percent of the company's business.

Stocks Hold Ground
NEW YORK (AP) Wall Street drifted in a narrow range Tuesday as investors paused from taking new positions in a 
holiday-shortened week even as shares of Google Inc. surpassed $500 for the first time. The hesitation by investors 
comes as Wall Street snapped a six-session winning streak on Monday, concerned that a recent run-up has driven 
some stocks too high. Big movements were not expected this week ahead of Thanksgiving, though retailers remain 
in focus ahead of one of the biggest shopping days of the year on Friday.

Deere 4Q Profit Rises 19 Percent
MOLINE, Ill. (AP) Higher prices for farm and lawn-care equipment helped lift Deere & Co.'s fiscal fourth-quarter 
profit by 19 percent. Its stock jumped 5 percent to a new high for the year, even as the company warned of a sales 
slowdown over the next year. Deere chairman and chief executive officer Robert W. Lane said the company's

New Macy's Stores Keep Holiday Tradition
CHICAGO (AP) The bronze signs on the department store's exterior walls still read Marshall Field's, but to Rick 
Roche, the transformed 10-story Macy's on Chicago's State Street is an unwelcome invader. "They're not going to 
get any of my business," huffed Roche, 52, a reference librarian from Downers Grove. He unceremoniously cut up 
a Macy's credit card after the retailer acquired Field's and other regional department stores as part of $11 billion

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair Holdings PLC's combative chief executive, criticized the directors of rival Irish airline Aer 
Lingus and ruled out raising his takeover offer Tuesday in a letter to the shareholders of the recently privatized 
airline.
O'Leary warned that the price of Aer Lingus Group PLC would drop if Ryanair abandoned its effort to take control of 
its main Irish competitor. Ryanair's bid values Aer Lingus at 1.48 billion euros ($1.89 billion).
Aer Lingus' current direction does not justify a price exceeding Ryanair's offer of 2.80 euros ($3.59) a share, 
O'Leary wrote. "Accordingly, Ryanair confirms that it will not increase its offer," he said in a 17-page letter, which is 
likely to be Ryanair's last effort to win backing from shareholders before a Dec. 4 deadline.
O'Leary, whose own aggressively marketed airline is the most rapidly growing and profitable in Europe, blasted the 
judgment and record of Aer Lingus directors. He said they were "not committed to delivering shareholder value" 
because they opposed Ryanair's approach in principle, and are "soft on staff costs" because they, unlike the 
cutthroat Ryanair, were committed to negotiating with labor unions.
He said Aer Lingus' recent purchases and rentals of Airbus aircraft cost 40 percent more than Ryanair's bulk orders 
of Boeings. He said Aer Lingus had been hiring new staff, when it needed to be cutting its work force dramatically. 
Last year, he noted, Ryanair carried nearly five times as many passengers per employee.
Ryanair, which launched its takeover bid Oct. 5 barely a week after the Irish government sold most of its stake in 
the national carrier, bought 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus' shares before they rose above the 2.80 euro level. But it 
faces an uphill climb to secure the required 50 percent of shares by Dec. 4. Last week it admitted that just 0.12 
percent of shareholders had responded positively to the offer.
The government, which has retained more than 25 percent of shares, also opposes the deal. So do the Aer Lingus 
pilots, who control more than 4.5 percent of shares, and Irish telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien, who holds 2.1 
percent.
Ryanair mocks Aer Lingus leaders in shareholder letter, rules out raising its takeover bid
On Wednesday the pivotal shareholder, the Employee Share Ownership Trust representing more than 4,600 
current and former Aer Lingus employees, is expected to announce the result of its internal ballot of members. 
O'Leary has already conceded that he requires support from the trust, which controls 12.6 percent of Aer Lingus, 
but probably won't get it.
Shares in both airlines dropped after the letter's publication. Aer Lingus fell 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at 2.70 
euros ($3.46), while Ryanair was 13 cents lower, or 1.3 percent, at 9.72 euros ($12.45), despite broadly positive 
trading Tuesday on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Stuart Draper, an analyst at Dolmen Stockbrokers in Dublin, said some investors still expected Ryanair to increase 
its bid price before Dec. 8, the deadline for Ryanair to present a revised offer. Were Ryanair to walk away, he said, 
Aer Lingus would be likely to fall back to the 2.50 euros ($3.20) mark.

Greencore led the Dublin market to a record closing high today after it confirmed plans to build a E1.1 billion new 
town centre on the edge of Carlow.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 84.20 points higher on 8890.07.
The impressive gains in Dublin came despite a weak start on Wall Street, ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving 
holiday.
 Greencore jumped over 1pc after it announced plans for its 330-acre former sugar factory in the town. The plan, 
which the company has submitted to Carlow County Council, includes 3,000 residential units, retail facilities and a 
50-acre business. The firm said the development will create 2,000 jobs in the area and "transform" the town. Shares 
closed 5c higher in Dublin this evening on 4.10. The financials also closed deep in positive territory with Bank of 
Ireland climbing 42c to 16.47, after it last week posted very strong growth in resources and profits, and again 
upgraded its earnings outlook for the full year. AIB also traded strongly, jumping 18c to 21.86, while Irish Life and 
Permanent added 30c to 19.85. Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 5c to 14.40 as it prepares to announce its results for the 
full year on 6 December. Dolmen Securities analyst, Stuart Draper, has forecast profit before tax and earnings per 
share of E860m and E0.95 respectively, representing year on year growth of 40pc and 34pc. He said such a result 
would be around 4pc stronger than consenus forecasts. In the construction sector, CRH was up 38c to 29.18, while 
Grafton added on 13c to 11.38. Kingspan and McInerney were also in positive territory, adding on 7c to 16.95 and 
13.10 respectively. Other notable movers included Ryanair, down 13c to 9.72 after it said it would not be upping its 
offer for Aer Lingus. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 4c to 2.70 on the news. United Drug, due to publish its full year results 
tomorrow, fell 1c to 3.77, while Elan climbed 34c to 11.74 after it announced on Monday that it has secured a 
larger-than-expected debt offering of USD615m rather than its previously announced USD500m. UTV closed 
unchanged on 5.88 after ITV, whom UTV gets much of its prgramming from, announced that it has formally rejected 
a £4.74bn cash-and-paper takeover offer, from cable giant NTL. ITV said the 122 pence per share offer 'materially 
ISEQ closes at record high on Greencore
undervalued' the business. Other notable mores yesterday included Dragon Oil, up 7c to 2.39, Irish Continental 
Group, down 29c to 12.71, Kerry Group, up 17c to 19.52 and Paddy Power, up 8c to 15.40. Newcourt Group was 
again in the black after weekend reports suggested that Newcourt is considering a bid for Cork-based co-op SWS. 
The company, which has a price tag of E100m, has interests in waste, wind energy and business services.

Ryanair has posted a document containing a letter to Aer Lingus shareholders urging them to accept its E2.80 per

The letter from Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, also says that the offer will not be increased. 
It also says that Ryanair does not believe there was anything in the recent Aer Lingus Defence Document to sustain 
any prospect of the current management of Aer Lingus delivering a share price of E2.80 or better.
 Mr O'Leary said that the markets obviously shared this view as Aer Lingus' share price currently stands below 
E2.80. "Aer Lingus shareholders should not accept investment advice from a board and management who 
determined that E2.20 was an appropriate flotation price for Aer Lingus, yet eight days later rejected Ryanair's offer 
of E2.80 - a 27pc premium - which they describe as "derisory"," the letter says. At 1300, shares in Aer Lingus were 
trading flat at E2.74.

The Dublin market started the week in a sluggish manner thanks to sharp falls amongst financial shares.
At 1300, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 40.34 to 8768.42.
Banking shares were the main fallers, with Irish Life and Permanent down 40c to 19.40, AIB down 18c to 21.55 and 
Anglo Irish Bank down 13c to 14.24. Bank of Ireland 2c to 16.01.
 The falls came after a report from Ulster Bank today indicated that The European Central Bank could hike interest 
rates to 4pc next year to combat inflation. Many analysts believe the ECB will call a halt at 3.75pc next Spring, but 
Ulster Bank's Niall Dunne says the bank is concerned about the outlook for inflation next year. Markets have almost 
taken for granted a 0.25-point rise at the next ECB meeting early next month. Meanwhile the Bundesbank has 
warned that euro zone interest rates are still very low and inflation risks persist despite a recent drop in the inflation 
rate. In its November monthly report, the Bundesbank said that the euro zone interest rates remain 'markedly low' 
even after the European Central Bank's 25 basis-point rate hike in October taking rates to 3.25pc. Elsewhere in 
Dublin today, shares in CRH were up 4c to 28.64, while Grafton tacked on 9c to 11.39 and Kingspan jumped 6c to 
16.93. McInerney bucked the trend falling 12c to 12.98. Other notable movers included paddy Power, down 9c to

Airline stocks are at record highs. For an industry that has lost more than Dollars 40bn in the past five years, and 
has become more inclined to pessimism than optimism, this is quite an achievement. Shares have received their 
biggest boost from the fall in the oil price. Fuel, 12 per cent of Association of European Airlines members' total costs 
in 2003, accounted for 20 per cent by last year, and for some operators much more. Airlines that chose not to 
hedge their fuel costs, such as Ryanair and Iberia, are the most obvious beneficiaries of the sharp decline. The 
impact on other airlines varies. For some, such as Lufthansa, a 10 per cent fall in the fuel price is estimated to result 
in a jump in operating profits of nearly a third. Airlines that imposed fuel surcharges on tickets are also unlikely to 
remove them swiftly. British Airways now imposes a Pounds 70 surcharge for long-haul return flights.
Fuel prices are not the only good news for airlines. Passenger numbers, which grew more than 5 per cent last year, 
are still increasing. Yields - which measure revenues per kilometre - are generally stable or rising.
Some caveats, though, are appropriate. The airline industry remains hostage to external shocks - be it another rise 
in the oil price, terrorist activity or global epidemics. There are more predictable clouds on the horizon, as well. After 
a post-9/11 lull, there has been a huge surge in aircraft orders in the past year. Capacity in European short-haul, 
where yields are already falling, is expected to grow particularly strongly.
So far, earnings estimates have only partially emulated share price rises, mainly because the consensus is 
expecting another oil price rally. Yet, on both earnings-per-share and cash flow-based valuations, the European 
airline sector is trading only at the top end of its historic range. Just a little bit more optimism on the oil price could 
give further fuel to the rally.

BSkyB's swoop on ITV underscores the increasing use of stakebuilding in takeover battles - a tactic made easier by 
reforms this year from the Takeover Panel, writes Chris Hughes.
Last month, Ryanair, led by Michael O'Leary, chief executive, scooped up 16 per cent of Aer Lingus before 
mounting a takeover bid, while Osprey, the consortium bidding for AWG, raised its existing stake in the water utility 
to scare off rival bidders, even after it had agreed a deal.
Spain's Ferrovial sealed its bid for BAA by mopping up 14 per cent of the airport operator in the summer, freezing 
out a rival bidder that was prepared to pay more. Stakebuilding was also critical to Pendragon's successful bid for 
Reg Vardy.
The tactic is intended to deter competing bidders, be they private equity firms or industrial rivals, or at the very least 
to make a turn if trumped.
Possession of a large stake may lock out business rivals whether or not the stakebuilder ultimately follows up with a 
bid for the company.
Some observers believe this may be what Nasdaq has in mind with its 25 per cent stake in the London Stock 
Exchange.
This year, the Takeover Panel relaxed its so-called substantial acquisition rules that had limited stakebuilders to 
buying no more than 15 per cent of a company in one day. They were forced to wait a week before acquiring a 
further 9.9 per cent and another week before buying an additional 4.9 per cent.
Stakebuilding has also become easier thanks to the increased activity of hedge funds.
Long-term shareholders often sell their shares in a company as soon as it becomes the subject of takeover interest.
Hedge funds take their place and are more easily persuaded to sell out again for a small - but rapid - profit.

in France, after accepting that it can no longer ignore the development of the fast-growing no-frills airline sector.
The project is expected to be approved at a meeting of the Air France board on Wednesday.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost carrier, has led the battle to break into the French market but has faced a struggle with 
the French authorities, in particular to gain more take-off and landing slots at Paris Orly airport.
Air France said it was also planning to establish its low-cost subsidiary at Orly, where it would use a separate 
terminal to its mainline operations. Full-service airlines around the world have had a chequered history of trying to 
launch low-cost operations. British Airways sold its Go subsidiary in mid-2001 but more recently Lufthansa 
developed Germanwings as its low-cost arm and last month Spain's Iberia led the launch of a low-cost affiliate, 
Clickair, based in Barcelona.
The Air France business will be based on an expansion of the Transavia.com subsidiary of KLM, the Dutch national 
carrier, which Air France took over in 2004.
Air France has held back from entering the low-cost sector. One European airline executive said: "For many years 
Air France was so arrogant to expect it could keep the low-cost carriers out of its market with the help of the French 
government, but now it realises that Brussels will not let the government act in this way any more."
Separately, KLM has made several efforts to respond to the challenge posed by the no-frills operators.
It launched Buzz in the UK as a low-cost brand at London Stansted airport and tried to develop Basiq Air as a low-
cost scheduled brand in the Netherlands as an extension of its Transavia charter business.
Both failed, with the loss-making Buzz operation being taken over by Ryanair in 2003. The Basiq Air brand was 
dropped at the end of 2004, when KLM decided to develop Transavia as a hybrid charter andscheduled leisure 
operator, which was rebranded as Transavia.com.
Air France plans foray into the low-cost sector TRANSPORT
Transavia.com, which has operating bases at Amsterdam Schiphol, Rotterdam and Eindhoven airports, has been 
seeking to expand beyond the Netherlands, and the base at Paris Orly will be the first such move.
Air France said it would maintain the Transavia.com brand for the French operation, which would be owned 60 per 
cent by Air France and 40 per cent by Transavia.com.
It will be French registered, with personnel working under French labour contracts in an effort to avoid conflicts with 
Air France's heavily entrenched trades unions.
Air France said the French Transavia.com subsidiary would operate a fleet of 186-seat Boeing 737-800s from Paris 
Orly's south terminal. Flights would be sold both to package tour operators and to individual passengers through the 
internet and call centres.
It would be launched next spring with a network of scheduled leisure routes from Paris to Spain, Morocco and 
Tunisia as well as a Paris-based holiday charter business.
In the Netherlands, Transavia.com has a fleet of 28 Boeing 737s, which is expanded in summer by chartering more 
aircraft.

CRH led the Dublin market higher this morning after the Government confirmed that it is to keep spending big in 
2007.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 32.66 points to 8824.62.
Building materials group CRH led the charge after Minister for Finance Brian Cowen said in his pre-budget 
estimates that building up the country's infrastructure remains a priority for the Government. Shares in the company 
jumped 55c to 28.70.
 The other construction shares were mixed with Grafton up 2c to 11.48, Kingspan down 10c to 16.85 and 
McInerney down 2c to 13.08. After announcing strong profits for its first six months yesterday, shares in Bank of 
Ireland were unchanged in Dublin this morning at 16.15. AIB made an impressive start, climbing 22c to 21.83, while 
Anglo Irish Bank remained flat on 14.40. Irish Life and Permanent added on 25c to 19.55. Aer Lingus continued its 
resurgent week, climbing 2c to 2.75, Ryanair remained flat on 9.85, while Paddy Power 15c to 15.60. Elsewhere,

Body
Bank of Ireland led the Dublin market modestly higher this morning after it issued a strong trading update for its first 
six months and upgraded forecasts for the full year.
At 1300, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 37.73 points to 8762.31.
Shares in Bank of Ireland were in favour after the bank announced a 5pc jump in pre tax profits for the six months 
to the end of September. It posted pre-tax profits of E887m for the period. After exceptional items such as 
restructuring charges and profits from asset sales are stripped out, pre-tax profits were 28pc higher at E852m, in 
line with expectations, it added. The results prompted the bank to lift its full-year earnings growth forecast to 20pc 
up from guidance in September for "high-teens" percentage growth. Shares were up 17c to 16.17 in Dublin.
 The results had a positive effect on the rest of the sector, with AIB up 4c to 21.53, Anglo Irish Bank up 2c to 14.32 
and Irish Life and Permanent up 3c to 19.30. Elsewhere, CRH led the construction sector higher, tacking on 18c to 
28.17. Grafton added on 4cto 11.44, while Kingspan jumped 11c to 16.75. McInerney bucked the trend, slipping 3c 
to 13.10. Shares in United Drug were down 1c to 3.72 as it prepares to release its full year results next week. 
Goodbody analyst, Ian Hunter, has forecast that the company will report adjusted earnings per share of 19.9c from 
revenue of E1.4bn. However, he said that there is potential for some upside to these numbers, after the firm 
published relatively strong interims. Other notable movers today include Ryanair, up 15c to 9.80, Aer Lingus, up 1c 
to 2.73, and Kerry Group, up 15c to 19.35. Paddy Power slipped 5c to 15.50.

No-frills airlines had 'little impact on growth' AVIATION
No-frills airlines had 'little impact on growth' AVIATION

Low-cost airlines, regarded by many environmental groups as one of the leading causes of surging air travel and 
rising carbon emissions, are largely blameless, a controversial report by the Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday.
"No-frills airlines do not appear to have significantly altered overall traffic growth," said Harry Bush, CAA group 
director for economic regulation.
The report says the low-cost carriers have revolutionised the short-haul market in the past decade in terms of the 
level and type of fares offered and the range of choice for passengers of airlines, airports and destinations. 
However, "contrary to common perceptions" the no-frills airlines appeared to have had little impact on overall rates 
of traffic growth.
There is little evidence of any marked change in the income and socio-economic profile of air passengers as a 
result of the arrival of Ryanair, EasyJet and the host of other low-cost carriers.
The report says the profile of no-frills and full-service leisure passengers has changed little over the past 10 years. 
It is still the better-off who travel by air.
Mr Bush said passengers on no-frills airlines closely resembled those on full service airlines. The main effect of the 
growth of the low cost carriers "has been to provide further opportunities to those in middle and higher income 
groups to fly more often".
The report shows that the average annual rate of growth in short-haul traffic in the past 10 years was similar to that 
before the arrival of the no-frills airlines.
The average growth of combined UK domestic and UK/European Union passenger traffic was 5.6 per cent a year in 
the years between 1975 and 1998, before the low-cost carriers had much presence, and between 1998 and 2005, 
the period in which they became a force in short-haul aviation.
Their biggest impact has been on the rival full-service and charter airlines, which have been forced to cede a large 
part of the aviation market to the new breed of competitors, losing almost half the market.
No-frills airlines had 'little impact on growth' AVIATION
Last year no-frills carriers, dominated by Ryanair and EasyJet, accounted for 42 per cent of total UK-EU traffic and 
for 49 per cent of total domestic traffic. Their share of UK-EU scheduled traffic was 52 per cent. The biggest losers 
have been the charter operators, as travellers have moved away from package holidays.
One area where the low-cost carriers are playing a significant role in social change, however, is in the migration of 
workers from east Europe, in particular to the UK and Ireland. In the early years of the no-frills carriers their 
business was dominated by outbound traffic, but this picture is changing rapidly, says the report.
"Inbound traffic on no-frills carriers has increased significantly, particularly with the opening of routes to eastern 
Europe, most notably Poland." This had coincided with a rise in the number of eastern Europeans taking up jobs in 
Britain after the enlargement of the EU. "But we cannot say that without the low-cost carriers there would be no 
Polish plumbers," said Mr Bush. "People might have come by bus anyway."

Bank of Ireland dominated corporate news stories yesterday with its upbeat half-year results and helped to lift the 
finance sector.
At teh close, the ISEQ was up 67.38 points to 8,791.96.
Bank of Ireland shares gained 16c to E16.16 while AIB rose by 12c to E21.61, Anglo Irish climbed 7c to E14.37 and 
Irish Life and Permanent edged up 3c to E19.30.
 No frills carrier, Ryanair, was a major gainer on the day with shares up 20c to E9.85 amid growing belief that 
Ryanair will be able to strike a very advantageous deal on future fuel supplies. Goodbody's analyst, Joe Gill, said 
trading in oil futures on the global market point to a possible 'excellent' deal for Ryaainr. 'We've kept an eye on Apr-
Sept 07 jet fuel futures because they will determine when RYA could strike with a hedge for next summer. Last 
night they dipped significantly, equating to the magic 10pc cost cut Ryanair is shooting for on oil next year. If that 
price is available in volume, expect news of a hedge with third quarter numbers in January,' he said.

Bank of Ireland led the Dublin market sharply higher this morning as it prepares to release its interim results 
tomorrow.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 46.59 points to 8693.88.
Shares in Bank of Ireland jumped 18c to 15.95 ahead of tomorrow's announcement. Goodbody analyst, Eamonn 
Hughes, said he is looking for headline Earnings Per Share of 72.5 cent, up 26pc year on year.
 "The Pre Tax Profit outturn is anticipated to be E853m (excluding any exceptionals). We are also pencilling in 
dividend growth of 15pc in H1 (though this should normalise to 12pc at the full year stage)." "Band of Ireland's 
preclose statement in mid-September led us to revise up our forecasts by 5pc. Our Irish numbers moved up 3pc, 
wholesale by 9pc and the UK by 10pc. As is the case at AIB, it appears that the international operations are 
providing the bulk of the operational leverage. Therefore, any potential positive EPS revisions bias is likely to reside 
in these businesses." The gains in Dublin today came despite around 250 workers from the bank holding a one-day 
strike over its new pension proposals for new staff. "The proposed move brings Bank of Ireland into line with other 
financial firms, so the action by the union is not welcomed, particularly ahead of a decision by the Labour Court on 
the issue to be published next month," Mr Hughes said. Other financial shares were boosted by comments from the 
Bank of England that indicated it was now less concerned about inflation. The bank thinks that inflation in the UK 
will return towards target quicker than it anticipated just three months ago, with the headline rate actually dipping 
below 2pc if one more rate rise materialises. In its quarterly economic projections, the central bank also said it 
thinks that the UK economy will grow by more than it anticipated in the August Inflation Report. The news lifted AIB 
5c higher to 21.50, while Anglo Irish Bank jumped 5c to 14.25. Irish Life and Permanent tacked on 9c to 19.29. 
Elsewhere on the market, CRH tacked on 41c to 11.79 after PPI figures released in the US on Tuesday showed 
price rises in concrete products. CRH is the number one producer of concrete in the US. Grafton climbed 9c to

Paddy Power, up 9c to 15.64. Shares in Ryanair were up 4c to 9.48 after it extended its offer for Aer Lingus on 
Tuesday after receiving shareholder support of only 0.118pc. The offer has now been extended to December 4. 
Meanwhile, shares in Aer Lingus continued to climb, up 1c to 2.74.

Bank of Ireland led the Dublin market sharply higher today ahead of its interims which are due out tomorrow 
morning.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the day 77.29 points higher on 8,724.58 
The bank's shares jumped 23c to 1600 amid predictions of impressive figures.
 Goodbody analyst Eamonn Hughes said he was looking for headline earnings per share of 72.5 cent, up 26pc on

UK by 10pc. "As is the case at AIB, it appears that its international operations are providing the bulk of the growth," 
Hughes said, adding that any upside in earnings per share was now dependent on activies outside Ireland. The rise 
in Bank of Ireland's share price today came despite it having around 250 members of its staff on a one-day strike 
over changes in its pension scheme. Hughes said the changes in the pension scheme brought the bank into line 
with other financial firms. With the emphasis on international earnings, both Bank of Ireland and other financial

EasyJet, the UK low-cost airline, increased its profits strongly in the past 12 months despite the impact of higher oil 
prices and the security upheaval at UK airports during the summer.
As a sign of growing confidence, EasyJet also announced yesterday a firm order for an additional 52 Airbus jets, 
with a current catalogue price of Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 1.73bn) before very heavy discounts, for delivery between 
2008 and 2010.
EasyJet said that Airbus had granted it "substantial price concessions," and the basic price for the additional 52 
aircraft was "substantially the same" as the deeply discounted price it had secured in its original firm order for 120 
aircraft placed in 2002.
The order will secure the airline's position as one of the two leading low-costcarriers in Europe alongside Ireland's 
Ryanair, and establishes EasyJet as one of Airbus's biggest customers worldwide.
EasyJet reported pre-tax profits up 55 per cent from Pounds 83m to a record Pounds 129m in the year to the end of 
September supported by an 11.5 per cent rise in passenger numbers to 33m. Turnover rose 21 per cent to Pounds 
1.62bn.
The EasyJet share price closed 7 1/2p higher at an all-time high of 573 1/2p.
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JPMorgan, said there was "good potential" for EasyJet to lift its margins further with 
more business passengers and lower aircraft costs. He left his forecast unchanged for a further rise of 44 per cent 
in pre-tax profits in this financial year.
Mr Harrison said the growth in profits was driven by higher ancillary revenues, the significant improvement in 
passenger yields and a continuing reduction in unit costs, excluding fuel, helped, in particular, by lower main-
tenance costs.
Ancillary revenues, which cover areas such as commission earnings on hotel, car rental and travel insurance 
bookings rose significantly by 34 per cent or 86p a seat.

The group achieved a 10.1 per cent return on equity, up from 7.1 per cent a year ago. It is aiming for a 15 per cent 
return in the year to September 2008.
EasyJet said it expected to increase capacity measured by available seats by 15 per cent in the current 
year,following an increase of 12.1 per cent last year.

Ryanair yesterday extended the deadline for acceptances for its Euros 2.80 a share bid for Aer Lingus to December 
4.
In a statement, Ryanair said it had so far received acceptances representing just 0.095 per cent of Aer Lingus' 
outstanding share capital.
Ryanair holds about 19.2 per cent of Aer Lingus, which it acquired on the open market. Aer Lingus shares traded at 
about Euros 2.73. Ryanair has made its offer conditional on gaining 50.1 per cent of Aer Lingus stock.
But it is facing a block of shareholders representing about 44 per cent of the share capital who are not likely to 
accept the bid. The block includes the Irish government, which holds about 25 per cent, Aer Lingus pilots, and the 
Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust, which has about a 12.5 per cent stake and is balloting members.

Ryanair Holdings PLC extended the deadline Tuesday for shareholders in Aer Lingus to accept the price of its 
takeover bid for the rival Irish airline and conceded its offer had won backing from only a tiny fraction of investors 
being targeted.
Ryanair needs more than 50 percent of Aer Lingus Group PLC shares to win control of the previously state-owned 
airline. It secured 19.2 percent of shares by Oct. 5, the day it launched a surprise 2.80 euro ($3.59) a share bid for 
Aer Lingus and just a week after the government floated most of its stake on the Irish and British markets for 27 
percent less.
But in a statement Tuesday, Ryanair said it had received acceptance forms from investors who held just 0.118 
percent of the Aer Lingus shares being sought for purchase. It said the deadline to reply would be extended to Dec. 
4. Ryanair said the deadline for it to raise its bid price or change other takeover proposals, in event of failing to win 
a majority stake, would be Dec. 8.
Ryanair, Europe's most aggressive and rapidly expanding no-frills airline, has run into a wall of opposition over its 
bid for Aer Lingus, its major competitor in this economically booming country of 4.2 million.
The government, which has retained more than 25 percent of the airline's shares, says it won't sell to Ryanair at 
any price. An investment fund and a pension fund representing Aer Lingus pilots with more than 4.5 percent also is 
opposed. Irish telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien bought a 2.1 percent stake specifically to complicate Ryanair's move.
The likely deal-breaker is the Employee Share Ownership Trust, which owns 12.6 percent on behalf of more than 
4,600 current and former employees of Aer Lingus. ESOT hasn't ruled out a deal with Ryanair but has criticized 
Ryanair's claims of member profits, in event of acceptance, as grossly overblown.
Ireland's corporate merger watchdog, the Takeover Panel, last week said Ryanair broke regulatory law with its 
claim that each ESOT member would receive more than 60,000 euros ($75,000). ESOT says the true figure, after 
taking into account the trust's debts and members' tax liabilities, in most cases would be less than half of this figure.
Ryanair extends takeover bid deadline for Aer Lingus shareholders to Dec. 4
Throughout October, investors' belief that Ryanair would raise its offer price kept Aer Lingus trading well above 2.80 
euros, but its shares have fallen over the past two weeks once Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary began 
stating his view that ESOT's opposition would probably kill the takeover bid.
Aer Lingus rose 0.7 percent to close at 2.73 euros ($3.51) Tuesday on the Irish Stock Exchange. Ryanair rose 0.3 
percent to end at 9.44 euros ($12.13).

Europe's second-largest discount airline easyJet PLC posted a 59 percent gain in full-year profit Tuesday after the 
company boosted passenger numbers and raised ticket prices.
The carrier also said it exercised options to buy another 52 Airbus A319 planes.
Net income increased to 94.1 million pounds (US$179 million; €139.9 million) from 59 million pounds in 2005, 
easyJet said in a statement. Revenue rose 21 percent to 1.62 billion pounds (US$3.09 billion; €2.41 billion). The 
company did not break out quarterly figures.
The airline also exercised options for the 52 A319s for delivery between 2008 and 2010 and took new options on 
another 75 planes of the A320 class. The additional 52 planes have a value of US$2.3 billion (€2.41 billion), though 
easyJet said it received "substantial price concessions" from Airbus and the engine manufacturer.
The company currently has a total of 122 aircraft.
During the period, easyJet began service on 58 new routes and to 11 new destinations. Passenger revenue during 
the period rose 5.9 percent to 2.13 pounds (US$4.07; €3.16) a seat.
Shares in easyJet slipped 0.2 percent to 564.75 pence (US$10.77; €8.39) on the London Stock Exchange.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, reported earlier this month that its second-quarter profits 
and sales rose more strongly than expected as passenger numbers on new routes grew. The company also raised 
its forecasts for coming months.

claim that each ESOT member would receive more than 60,000 euros ($75,000). ESOT says the true figure, after 
taking into account the trust's debts and members' tax liabilities, in most cases would be less than half of this figure.
Ryanair extends takeover bid deadline for Aer Lingus shareholders to Dec. 4
Throughout October, investors' belief that Ryanair would raise its offer price kept Aer Lingus trading well above 2.80 
euros, but its shares have fallen over the past two weeks once Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary began 
stating his view that ESOT's opposition would probably kill the takeover bid.
Aer Lingus rose 0.7 percent to close at 2.73 euros ($3.51) Tuesday on the Irish Stock Exchange. Ryanair rose 0.3 
percent to end at 9.44 euros ($12.13).

Ryanair Holdings PLC extended the deadline Tuesday for shareholders in Aer Lingus to accept the price of its 
takeover bid for the rival Irish airline and conceded its offer had won backing from only a tiny fraction of investors 
being targeted.
Ryanair needs more than 50 percent of Aer Lingus Group PLC shares to win control of the previously state-owned 
airline. It secured 19.2 percent of shares by Oct. 5, the day it launched a surprise €2.80 (US$3.59) a share bid for 
Aer Lingus and just a week after the government floated most of its stake on the Irish and British markets for 27 
percent less.
But in a statement Tuesday, Ryanair said it had received acceptance forms from investors who held just 0.118 
percent of the Aer Lingus shares being sought for purchase. It said the deadline to reply would be extended to Dec. 
4. Ryanair said the deadline for it to raise its bid price or change other takeover proposals, in event of failing to win 
a majority stake, would be Dec. 8.
Ryanair, Europe's most aggressive and rapidly expanding no-frills airline, has run into a wall of opposition over its 
bid for Aer Lingus, its major competitor in this economically booming country of 4.2 million.
The government, which has retained more than 25 percent of the airline's shares, says it won't sell to Ryanair at 
any price. An investment fund and a pension fund representing Aer Lingus pilots with more than 4.5 percent also is 
opposed. Irish telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien bought a 2.1 percent stake specifically to complicate Ryanair's move.
The likely deal-breaker is the Employee Share Ownership Trust, which owns 12.6 percent on behalf of more than 
4,600 current and former employees of Aer Lingus. ESOT hasn't ruled out a deal with Ryanair but has criticized 
Ryanair's claims of member profits, in event of acceptance, as grossly overblown.
Ireland's corporate merger watchdog, the Takeover Panel, last week said Ryanair broke regulatory law with its 
claim that each ESOT member would receive more than €60,000 (US$75,000). ESOT says the true figure, after

Sharp gains in Elan failed to inspire the Dublin market today as early gains were eroded by a negative start on Wall 
Street.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 3.84 points lower on 8647.29, having been up as much as 50 points earlier in 
the day.
A sluggish start across the Atlantic was enough to send the market lower as a mixed retail sales report offset in-line 
numbers from Wal-Mart and Target and a surprising drop in core PPI data.
 Pharmaceutical group Elan was the day's star performer as it put weeks of sluggish trading behind it to jump 49c to 
11.19. Shares in the biotech have struggled over recent times after it announced worse than expected results for 
the third quarter. The firm, which reintroduced Tysabri for multiple sclerosis in July, said last month that its third-
quarter loss widened to USD117m, or 27 cents a share, from a loss of USD67.1m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. AIB 
weighed heavy on the market, falling 17c to 21.45 on profit taking. Elsehwere in the financial sector, Bank of Ireland 
closed 1c higher on 15.91, while Irish Life and Permanent tacked on 5c to 19.20. Anglo Irish Bank was unchanged 
on 14.12. Shares in the business support services group DCC were in the black for the second consecutive day 
after it announced strong interim results on Monday. The firm reported pre-tax profits of E40.4m for the six months 
to the end of September, up 20pc on the first half of 2005, while total revenues were up 18pc to E1.8bn. As a result, 
the group has raised its full-year growth forecast. DCC also announced the acquisition of a 90pc stake in 
Nottingham-based Wastecycle. The price initially is E8.7m, with a further E8m to be paid depending on profit 
targets. Shares in DCC closed 5c higher on 23.30 in Dublin today. CRH was in the black, up 22c to 27.72, while 
Grafton fell 19c to 11.26. Kingspan was down 5c to 16.45, while McInerney fell 10c to 13.20. Shares in Ryanair 
were up 1c to 9.43 after it extended its offer for Aer Lingus after receiving shareholder support of only 0.118pc. The 
offer, which ran out at 3pm today, will be extended to December 4. The extension comes as no surprise to the 
Buoyant Elan fails to lift sluggish ISEQ
market as Ryanair had been expected to extend this as the Aer Lingus ESOT, which represents current and former

black, jumping 2c to 2.73. Other notable movers included CandC, up 1c to 11.82, Kerry Group, up 10c to 19.25, and 
United Drug, up 5c to 3.73. Food group IAWS continued its recent strong trading, climbing 3c to 18.18, as it 
continues to go from strength to strength. The firm last month announced its largest ever acquisition, with the 
purchase of US bakery products outfit Otis Spunkmeyer in a dollar 561m deal. Since the announcement on October 
16, shares in IAWS have soared more than E3.00.

Body
Ryanair is expected today to disclose the number of acceptances it has received so far for its E1.4 billion offer for 
Aer Lingus, with the numbers expected to be low.
Ryanair is offering E2.80 a share and while this is above the current market price - which closed last night at E2.72 
- it is unlikely to persuade a sufficient number of shareholders to give Ryanair majority control of the former State-
owned airline.
Ryanair will also have the chance today to indicate whether it will extend its offer. Most sources believe the 
announcement will include an extension of the offer.
 With the Aer Lingus share price falling back over the past week, this could prompt an improved level of 
acceptances. Around 47pc of the shareholders remain opposed to the offer - this includes the Government, the 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot), two pilot groups and entrepreneur Denis O'Brien.

Pilots at airlines such as Ryanair with bases all over Europe are being offered a system for liaising with their 
company centrally - no matter in which state or jurisdiction they are domiciled - the European Cockpit Association 
(ECA) announced at its General Assembly last week. Known as the trans national airlines convention (TNAC), the 
tool allows the ECA to deal with individual pilots' employment issues by providing representation at the airline's 
headquarters and expert local assistance.ECA secretary general Philip von Schoppenthau says the first such 
arrangement - for EasyJet pilots - that was set up in June is proving helpful to pilot members, and the TNAC 
structure can assist flightcrew, whether their airline recognises a representative association or not. ECA president 
Martin Chalk says: "In the liberalised European aviation market, social laws are still lagging behind while airlines 
stretch out across borders and employ and base pilots in several countries. We will not stand by and do nothing 
where determined employers have the possibility to split the pilot voice and play pilot groups off against each 
other."crew management conference: www. FLIGHTGLOBAL.COM/CREW06

Airport operator Fraport AG said Monday that the number of passengers using its six facilities from January to 
October rose by 1.5 percent, or about 63 million passengers.
The company said that all of its airports showed an increase in the number of passengers during the first 10 months 
of the year. Its biggest, Frankfurt International Airport, had 44.9 million passengers come through, up 0.8 percent 
from the first 10 months of 2005. Cargo increased by 9.3 percent to 1.7 million metric tons.
In October alone, overall passenger traffic rose to 6.9 million, up 1.7 percent from a year ago. That included a 23.9 
percent rise at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, which counted 347,512 passengers. Hahn is a base for Irish airline Ryanair.
Traffic last month at Fraport's other German airports fell, including at Frankfurt International, which posted a 0.6 
percent decline in passenger numbers.
Hanover Airport saw traffic decline 5.8 percent in October to 592,590 passengers, while Saarbruecken Airport's 
passenger rate fell 15.9 percent with 45,718 passengers.
However some 565,536 passengers used Fraport's international terminal at Antalya Airport in Turkey, a 9 percent 
rise, while 568,719 passengers flew in and out of Peru's Lima Airport, up 16.2 percent from a year ago.

Bank of Ireland dragged a sluggish Dublin market lower today as investors await its interim results, due on 
Thursday.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 33.85 points lower on 8651.13.
Bank of Ireland weighed heavy on the financial market, falling 5c to 15.99. Goodbody analyst Eamonn Hughes is 
forecasting pre-tax profits of E853m (excluding exceptionals) and a 26pc jump in earnings per share to 72.5c. 
"Bank of Ireland's pre-close statement in mid-September led us to revise up our forecasts by 5pc. Our Irish 
numbers moved up 3pc, wholesale by 9pc and the UK by 10pc," Mr Hughes said.
 "We are anticipating a 27pc jump in profits in its Irish business to E336m. This will be underpinned by double digit 
revenue growth, but less than 5pc cost growth as benefits of the restructuring process flow through." Elsewhere in 
the sector, AIB fell 7c to 21.68, while Anglo Irish Bank made 1c to 14.18. Irish Life and Permanent tacked on 17c to 
close on 19.24. Construction shares performed sluggishly with CRH falling 15c to 27.50 and Grafton down 5c to 
11.45. Kingspan managed slight gains tacking on 5c to 16.40, while McInerney added 2c to 13.15 after the 
housebuilder confirmed the appointment of Desmond O'Connor as managing director for McInerney Spain. United 
Drug fell 1c to 3.69 despite one of its main competitors in the Irish drug wholesale business, Celesio, posting 
weaker growth in its third quarter. Meanwhile, Elan was a major faller, down 25c to 10.70. Shares in drinks group 
C&C were in the red again following indications last week that its Magners brand may not be performing as well as 
hoped. Poorer than expected data from Neilson led to sharp falls on Friday, while investors also took the 
opportunity to pocket gains from recent months. Shares in C and C have increased more than five-fold since a 2004 
stock market debut and have more than doubled this year thanks largely to the success of Magners and Bulmers 
cider. Fyffes closed 3c lower on 1.65 after it issued a circular on Friday covering the demerger of its General 
produce and Distribution business. The move will see the cancellation of its listing on the official lists and admission 
ISEQ down as financials weigh heavy
to the AIM market in London and the IEX market in Dublin. Shareholder in Fyffes will receive one share in new firm 
- Total Produce - for every one share they own in Fyffes. Shares in Independent News and Media also slipped into 
the red, down 4c to 2.66, while FBD Holdings fell 17c to 29.83 and IAWS slipped 5c to 18.15. No frills airline 
Ryanair jumped 3c to 9.45, while Aer Lingus lost 1c to 2.72. The falls in Dublin came despite a strong start on Wall 
Street, where stocks edged higher on falling oil prices. However, trade there is likely to be volatile ahead of a busy 
week for US data, with producer prices, consumer prices and retail sales all due.

Meteor, the mobile phone operator owned by Eircom, has reported a pre-tax loss of E81m despite a massive surge 
in revenues.
In the 15 months to the end of March last, Meteor recorded revenues that rose to E255m compared to revenues of 
E100m in the same period a year earlier when pre-tax losses amounted to E35m.
The company, which was taken over by Eircom for E420m last year, changed its accounting period to fall into line 
with its new parent.
 Eircom is now required to publish separate accounts for Meteor as a condition of the Competition Authority's 
approval for the takeover. The losses come as Meteor - described by former Eircom chairman, Tony' O'Reilly as the 
'Ryanair of the mobile phone industry' - has invested heavily in its attempts to build up market share against its two 
main rivals, Vodafone and O2. Meteor has raised its share of the Irish mobile market to 16pc over the last four 
months and is adding subscribers at a rate of almost 19,000 a month. However, this has come at a hefty price.

Charlie McCreevy, a former Irish government minister and a leading European commissioner, has pitched into 
Ryanair's takeover battle for Aer Lingus, emerging as unlikely cheerleader for the low-cost airline's business 
achievements and provoking an angry trade union response.
Although he said he did not want to enter the row over Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 995m) hostile bid, the 
former Irish finance minister used a speech on Thursday night to praise Ryanair for "bringing competition to the 
market".
Mr McCreevy said: "In a speech about competition, it would be strange not to mention the benefits that travel has 
brought and Ryanair has been at the forefront."
He said Ireland had "benefited extraordinarily" through competition and the opening up of new air routes and 
"Ryanair has been the leader in that market".
The threat to competition posed by the planned take over by Ryanair of Aer Lingus is the main argument the Irish 
government has been using in Brussels to urge the bid be blocked.
Christy McQuillan, of the Services Industrial Professional Technical Union, the main union body that accounts for 
half of Aer Lingus's 3,500 workforce, said: "It is very difficult to know where Charlie McCreevy is coming from and 
certainly it flies in the face of what the government says they're doing in Europe with regard to the Ryanair bid."
He described Mr McCreevy's comments as "interference we don't need".
The Irish government retains a 25.8 per cent stake following Aer Lingus' initial public offering in September. The 
Employee Share Ownership Trust, which is balloting its 4,666 members, owns 12.58 per cent.
The EU Commission has indicated it will give a provisional response on December 6 on whether the deal is big 
enough to trigger an official competition probe.
Anger over McCreevy praise for Ryanair
Mr McCreevy said in his speech that Ryanair was "at or near the top of the list" of companies that have transformed 
Ireland in recent years.

A robust earnings season and intense merger and acquisition activity helped drive European shares up.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index advanced just above1 per cent over the week to 1,464.19, a five and a half-year high. 
The French benchmark index, the CAC 40, rose 1.4 per cent to 5,447.5 while the Xetra Dax in Germany added 1.9 
per cent to 6,357.77.
Sacyr Vallehermoso belatedly emerged as the week's strongest performer. Its shares jumped 6 per cent on Friday 
to Euros 46.80, an increase of 13.3 per cent on the week. Investors expect strong third-quarter results on Monday 
from the Spanish construction group, which on Thursday was reported to have raised its stake in oil group Repsolto 
as much as15.2 per cent.
Sacyr declined to confirm the move, which would make it Repsol's biggest shareholder. In October Sacyr said it 
wanted to buy up to 20 per cent of the company. Repsol shares rose4.3 per cent over the week to Euros 27.80. 
JPMorgan raised its price target in the company to Euros 23.50 from Euros 21.50.
The brokerage said Sacyr's move increased the risk of a takeover, and reiterated its "underweight" rating on the 
shares. Numico rose 9.4 per cent on the week to Euros 38.96 after the Dutch food group posted a 25 per cent 
increase in third-quarter earnings before interest, tax and amortisation to Euros 123m.
Sampo Bank, the third-largest bank in the Nordic region, rose strongly on news of an agreed takeover by 
Denmark's Danske Bank for DKr30.1bn (Dollars 5.2bn) in cash. Sampo, the Finnish parent of Sampo Bank, gained 
almost 11 per cent over the week to Euros 18.82. UBS raised its price target on the group to Euros 19 from Euros 
17.5, but kept its "neutral" rating. Danske Bank rose 1.5 per cent to DKr252.
No-frills airline Ryanair gained 5.1 per cent over the week to Euros 9.42, hitting a record high of Euros 9.66 along 
the way, after raising its full-year profit target.
Sweeping successes for the Democratic party in the US mid-term elections proved a bitter pill for the 
pharmaceuticals sector. Novartis fell 3.7 per cent to SFr73.75 while Fresenius, the German dialysis group, lost 3

Adidas, the German sportswear maker, shed7 per cent during the week to Euros 36.84 after it issued a profit 
warning on Thursday, prompting a wave of broker downgrades. Adidas said net income growth would app-roach 15 
per cent for the year, against the 20 per cent previously forecast. It also said its recently acquired Reebok brand 
would post a full-year loss.
Natexis Banques Populaire fell 6.1 per cent on the week to Euros 209 ahead of an upcoming secondary share 
offering.
Michael Schenk, an analyst at UBS Investment Research, said: "We're not surprised Natexis is coming down, since 
it has been quite expensive. Our target price is Euros 205."

Jump racing in Britain is booming, with more trainers, more horses in training and significant investment in improved 
facilities. And today the winter sport comes into its own with Cheltenham's Open meeting, highlighted by the Paddy 
Power Gold Cup.
Some things change. Martin Pipe, 15 times the champion trainer, lost the title last year to Paul Nicholls and retired. 
But some things stay the same.
The ante-post gambling excitement in the Paddy Power, of whose 10 runnings Pipe won seven, is still a horse 
trained at his Nicolashayne yard in Somerset.
Only now the man in charge is his 33-year-old son David, who has demonstrated his ability to handle top horses by 
winning the Charlie Hall Chase with Our Vic. Vodka Bleu is his main hope for the Paddy Power but he also runs 
Tamarinbleu, and the sponsor will only give you 11/4 against a Pipe-trained winner.
Paul Nicholls trains the favourite Taranis and looks set for another rewarding season with chasers such as Kauto 
Star, Star de Mohaison and Denman, while Desert Quest, a winner at Ascot under a big weight, provides his first 
serious contender for the Champion Hurdle. His West Country rival, Philip Hobbs, has Detroit City, with whom he 
won the Cesarewitch on the Flat, and Noble Request as challengers.
The man who could give them both a run for the trainers' championship is Jonjo O'Neill. After two seasons blighted 
by a stable virus, he leads the table after the summer jumping phase with 66 winners.
Backed by owner and fearless punter J.P. McManus and with Tony McCoy as their contract rider, O'Neill could 
make a serious run at the championship this year with horses such as Black Jack Ketchum, the most impressive 
winner of all at Cheltenham's Festival meeting in March.
Some big prizes could go north to Nicky Richards, who trains the thrilling grey chaser Monet's Garden, and Howard 
Johnson, backed by millionaire Graham Wylie and with the exciting talent of Paddy Brennan as stable jockey.
Trainers set the pace for vintage season HORSERACING
The big question is whether the Irish will continue their domination. Last year they took a record 10 of 24 
Cheltenham Festival contests. Gold Cup winner War of Attrition, owned by Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary, was 
followed home by two more Irish runners, and the Irish supplied the first four in the Champion Hurdle won by Brave 
Inca.
They had the first two as well in Numbersixvalverde's Grand National. Only the third place obtained by Clan Royal 
(owned by McManus, trained by O'Neill and ridden by McCoy but at least trained in Gloucestershire) denied an Irish 
1-2-3.
So far this season though it is the Welsh factor that has been in evidence. Second in the trainers' table is 
Haverfordwest-based Peter Bowen with 45 winners and fourth with 40 is Evan Williams, who trains near Cardiff. 
Expect to hear a lot more of Williams, who has achieved first-class results with cheap cast-offs from better-known 
yards and who is now being sent better horses by owners such as Sir Robert Ogden. Another Welsh trainer doing 
well is Alison Thorpe.
Riding find of the season has been Tom O'Brien, who started last year as an amateur with Hobbs but who has 
ridden many of the Bowen horses. Only McCoy, who tops the table with 83 winners - despite a six-week absence 
with a broken wrist - and Richard Johnson, with 67, lead O'Brien's total of 59.
A vintage season beckons. May they all come back safely.

To get to Reggio Calabria, by air you need to change at either Milan, Rome or Bologna airport.
An alternative is to take Ryanair to Lamezia Terme airport, some 160km north of Reggio Calabria and hire a car.

There is a shortage of good hotels in Reggio proper. It is better to opt for one of the hotels in Scilla, overlooking the

C and C led the Dublin market lower this morning as shares in the drinks group fell almost 5pc.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 24.15 points to 8667.02.
C and C was the biggest faller, shedding 60c to 11.77, however, Davy analyst John O'Reilly said that the sharp falls 
could just be an "overreaction" to cider consumption figures released in the UK.
 Financial shares also weighed heavy, with AIB down 8c to 21.73 and Anglo-Irish Bank down 10c to 14.30. 
Meanwhile, Irish Life and Permanent managed marginal gains, up 5c to 19.10, while Bank of Ireland was 
unchanged on 16.00. Amongst construction shares, CRH was a strong performer, climbing 15c to 27.47. Grafton 
slipped 7c to 11.58, while Kingspan fell 8c to 16.30 and McInerney traded flat on 13.06. Shares in insurance group 
FBD Holdings were up 15c to 40.00 after inflation figures, released by the Central Statistics Office on Thursday, 
showed that personal insurance rates held steady during the month October having fallen sharply in September. 
The figures were good news for FBD as they showed that year-on-year declines in household rates now stand at 
7.4pc (unchanged), while in motor the decline is running at 9.5pc (down from over 10pc in September). Household 
rates are now down 16pc from their peak in 2003 and motor 32pc from their peak in 2002. Davy said that rates for 
the latter are now back to where they were in 1999. Elsewhere, Ryanair was down 10c to 9.33 on profit taking after 
a run of impressive gains over recent weeks. The falls came despite EU internal markets commissioner and former 
finance minister, Charlie McCreevy, heaping praise on Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary for bringing competition to the 
airline industry. With the budget carrier's E1.4 billion takeover bid for Aer Lingus floundering, Mr McCreevy, head of 
the EU's internal market, said the no-frills policies were good for the Irish economy revolutionising business. Shares 
in Aer Lingus fell a further 1c today to trade at 2.73.

The Irish Takeover Panel yesterday reprimanded Ryanair for deficiencies in statements that it made in its offer 
document about the gains to be made by Aer Lingus employees from its Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) takeover bid 
for its rival Irish airline.
It said Aer Lingus shareholders were unable to assess the significance of the Ryanair claims as Ryanair had failed 
to provide sufficient detail on the assumptions underpinning its figures.
In the offer document, Ryanair said that its Euros 2.80-a- share bid "equates to an average of over Euros 60,000 
per (Aer Lingus) employee with a tax-free option for Esot (employee share ownership trust) members".
Esot said two weeks ago that it had informed the panel that current employee members of the trust would realise 
Euros 38,864 on average, if the Ryanair bid was accepted, while former empl- oyees would receive Euros 13,915 
on average. Kevin Done

Irish regulators criticized Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday for making a misleading claim to Aer Lingus 
shareholders as part of its troubled campaign to take control of the rival airline. Shares in both carriers fell.
The Irish Takeover Panel said Ryanair failed to provide an adequate explanation for its repeatedly made claim that 
Aer Lingus employees would receive more than $76,800 each if they accepted the no-frills airline's hostile takeover 
bid.
The government-appointed panel, which monitors and regulates merger activity in the Republic of Ireland, noted 
that Aer Lingus had offered a far more specific and much lower-valued breakdown for the potential payout to 
members of the Employee Share Ownership Trust. The trust, known as ESOT, controls 12.6 percent of Aer Lingus 
shares on behalf of 4,700 current and former Aer Lingus employees and is considered the swing vote in 
determining whether Ryanair's bid succeeds.
ESOT estimates that the average actual payout, before tax, to each current employee would be $49,750, and for 
former employees $17,800.
While not commenting on whether Ryanair's or ESOT's accounting was more credible, the Irish Takeover Panel 
ruled that Ryanair's claim broke regulatory requirements because it "did not satisfy the standards of completeness."
The panel said Ryanair failed to provide "sufficient detail on the assumptions underpinning the figures. ... 
Consequently, Aer Lingus shareholders were provided with insufficient detail to enable them to assess the 
significance of this statement."
Ryanair holds at least 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares, but requires more than 50 percent for its takeover plans to 
succeed. Ranged against it are the government, which holds 25.4 percent of shares; investment trusts led by Aer 
Lingus pilots with 6.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 percent.
Irish regulator says Ryanair made misleading claim in Aer Lingus takeover bid
If the ESOT directors rejected the Ryanair offer as expected, together the confirmed anti-Ryanair camp would 
account for 46.6 percent of shares.
Ryanair offered 2.80 euros ($3.58) a share for Aer Lingus on Oct. 5 just a week after the government sold most of 
its stake in the previously state-controlled airline for 27 percent less. Aer Lingus shares immediately soared above 
that price on the Irish and British stock exchanges and reached a high of 3.05 euros as investors waited for a higher 
Ryanair offer that didn't come.
Ryanair has been legally barred from buying more Aer Lingus stock until its shares slipped back below 2.80 euros, 
which happened Wednesday night. Aer Lingus shares fell 2.15 percent to close at 2.73 euros ($3.49).
Traders said they didn't see Ryanair moving back into the market for Aer Lingus shares Thursday.
Ryanair shares fell back from Wednesday's 52-week high as well, shedding 0.7 percent to end at 9.43 euros 
($12.05).

Sharp gains in AIB were not enough to stop the Dublin market slipping into the red today, as early gains were wiped 
away by a slow start on Wall Street and increasing interest rate fears.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 13.91 points lower on 8691.17 having almost broken through the 8700 level 
earlier in the session.
There was little doubt who was the star performer as shares in AIB soared after it issued a bullish investor 
presentation in London on Wednesday. The bank said that it was confident it would achieve double-digit profit 
growth up to 2010. Ireland's largest bank said the growth would come mainly from its Irish and Polish operations. 
The bank reported a 30pc rise in first-half profit in August and for the last full financial year AIB reported pre-tax 
profit of E0.7 billion. Shares closed 35c higher on 21.91.
 The news lifted other financial shares with Bank of Ireland climbing 5c to 16.00 and Irish Life and Permanent up 
19c to 19.05. Anglo Irish Bank bucked the trend, falling 19c to 14.52. Elan slipped into negative territory after 
trading in the black for much of the day after the pharmaceutical firm announced that it intends to raise USD500m 
through offering senior fixed and floating rate notes, repayable in 2013. The rates have yet to be agreed and will be 
determined by investor demand and market conditions. The proceeds will be used to repay a part of the outstanding 
USD613m of the 7.25pc Athena notes due in 2008. Goodbody Stockbrokers described the transaction as a "sound 
financial move". Shares closed 5c lower on 10.90 last night. The construction sector fell back, with CRH the biggest 
faller, down 25c to 27.32. Shares in McInerney were down 4c to 13.06, while Kingspan fell 8c to 16.42 and Grafton 
closed flat on 11.65. Other notable movers included drinks group CandC, down 7c to 12.58, business support 
services firm DCC, down 25c to 21.95 and Independent News and Media, down 6c to 2.67. South Wharf fell 10c to 
6.90. Aer Lingus continued its recent falls as investors continue to pocket profits and admit resignation that 
Ryanair's takeover bid seems doomed to fail. Shares were down 6cto 2.73. Meanwhile, Ryanair dropped 7c to 9.43 
after its recent good run which has seen its share price jump almost 34pc since August 21. The falls came after the

AIB led the Dublin market sharply higher this morning after it last night said it expects to post double-digit profit

Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 45.31 points to 8750.39.
After closing 15 points lower on Wednesday, shares recovered well in early exchanges with the ISEQ almost

 AIB was the star performer, climbing 39c to 21.95, after it issued an upbeat trading update to investor conference

up to 2010, with the impetus for the earnings growth coming mainly from its Irish and Polish operations. The bank

intend to offer, subject to market conditions, USD500 million in aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate 
notes/bonds due 2013 and senior floating rate notes due 2013. Shares tacked on 2c to 10.97 on the news. 
Construction shares were mixed, with CRH and Grafton climbing 15c to 27.72 and 10c to 11.75 respectively. 
McInerney slipped 6c to 13.04, while Kingspan fell 5c to 16.45. Ryanair continued to make steady progress, 
climbing 9c to 9.59, after it posted excellent quarterly results on Monday. The airline said that revenues were up 
27pc and profits up 23pc. However, shares in Aer Lingus continued their recent dip, falling 2c to 2.77.

Highlight: Ryanair has been rapped by the Irish Takeover Panel over its claim that ESOT members would get 
E60k from its bid.
Body
Ryanair has been rapped by the Irish Takeover Panel for breaching the regulator's rules in a statement made 
relating to the 1.48 bn euro hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
Ryanair had claimed in an Oct 20 statement its 2.80 euro a share bid for Aer Lingus was worth an average of over 
60,000 euro to each member of the Irish flag carrier's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT), which holds a 
12.6 pc stake.
'While some of the assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement are set out in the announcement, the 
panel decided that sufficient detail on the assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement was not disclosed,' 
the panel said.
 'Consequently, Aer Lingus shareholders were provided with insufficient detail to enable them to assess the 
significance of this statement. As such, the statement did not satisfy the standards of completeness required.' Aer 
Lingus reckons Ryanair's offer is worth an average of 38,864 euro to employee members of ESOT and an average 
of 13,915 euro to ex-employee members. Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pc stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 
50.1 pc holding that will give it management control. However, opponents of the bid hold already some 46.6 pc -- a 
figure made up of ESOT's holding as well as the Irish government with 25.4 pc, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pc, the 
Tailwind employees/pilots group with 4.2 pc, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pc -- making the 
arithmetic difficult for Ryanair. On Monday, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said it was most likely ESOT 
members would reject the offer, making it hard for the bid to succeed.

Many American fliers searching for better service have turned to European carriers for the perks such as free 
meals, alcohol and newspapers that have vanished from U.S. airlines. Now, the stinginess is moving across the 
ocean.
Threatened by low-cost competition from the likes of Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, and running up 
against some of the financial concerns that have bedeviled the U.S. industry in the past five years, European 
airlines are increasingly looking to the nickel-and-dime tactics that have come to characterize service in the 
domestic U.S. And the areas that are seeing the deepest cuts are the very delights that Europe is best known for: 
food and drink.
Last month, Scandinavian Airlines System started giving passengers in intercontinental economy just one free 
alcoholic drink, compared with the previous policy of unlimited booze. SAS began charging for food and drink in its 
intra-Europe economy class last year. Earlier this year, British Airways PLC stopped serving full meals on flights 
that occur during midmorning or midafternoon. (There are snacks and drinks instead.) Austrian Airlines AG began 
charging last year for meals on economy flights under 2 1/2 hours (coffee, tea, water and a chocolate remain 
complimentary). Iberia SA, Spain's airline, has taken free meals out of the economy cabin on all short- and medium-
haul flights. Aer Lingus Group PLC of Ireland now charges for food and drink on flights within Europe water, for 
instance, costs about $1.90. On the airline's trans-Atlantic flights, all alcoholic beverages now cost money.
Airlines are increasingly charging for other services, too. Taking a page from Ryanair, SAS this year started 
charging for large baggage checked by passengers flying within Sweden; skis are 100 Swedish krona, or about 
$14, for example. British Airways this year raised its surcharge for travelers within the U.K. who pay with credit 
cards (it's now GBP 3, up from GBP 2). Aer Lingus charges for newspapers on flights around Europe.
The policy shifts are irking some travelers, especially Americans who like a little pampering overseas. Shantanu 
Rana, a 30-year-old product manager for a research firm who lives in Jersey City, N.J., was surprised when, on a 
recent SAS flight between Copenhagen and Frankfurt, economy passengers were asked to pay for food and drink. 
"I didn't expect SAS to be nickel-and-diming like that," he says. "It's becoming a lot like the U.S. domestic carriers."
European airlines get stingy
Cecilia Galluzzi, SAS Sweden's product manager for Europe, explains that the airline needed to cut some services 
in order to bring prices down, and that the majority of passengers surveyed favored low prices over expanded in-
flight options.
The majority of changes are taking place within Europe, but they're being felt on more trans-Atlantic routes, too. As 
more airlines team up as members of alliances, U.S. and European airlines have been standardizing some of their 
offerings. The beefed-up alliances, coupled with the fact that U.S. airlines have added flights to Europe, also mean 
that a passenger who buys a ticket on a European airline could wind up on a U.S. carrier's plane instead. Delta Air 
Lines, for instance, increased its trans-Atlantic service 25 percent this September, compared with last. And because 
Delta has a code-share arrangement with Air France-KLM SA, passengers who purchase Air France coach tickets 
(and are expecting the carrier's unlimited booze) could end up on a Delta plane (where there's only one free 
alcoholic beverage per coach passenger).
All of this is happening as more travelers look to the skies to cross the short distances between countries in Europe. 
Since the European skies were deregulated in the late 1990s, the low-cost industry in Europe has grown from five 
carriers with 50 planes, to 50 low-cost carriers with about 350 aircraft, according to Chris Avery, a European airline 
analyst with J.P. Morgan.
The competition is good news for travelers, since it means that fares are falling: Earlier this year, for example, 
British Airways slashed many fares within Europe by up to 50 percent.
"In Europe, a la carte pricing has been a response to the new entrants in the market," says Chris Tarry, a European 
airline industry analyst. "As air travel is changing in Europe, it's getting much closer to what it is in the U.S. It's 
become much more mass market, much less elitist."
Paul Paflik, general manager of Austrian's Americas division, says that this increasing price competition was the 
reason his airline had to go to a paid food system. Nonetheless, he says that passengers didn't always like the 
airlines previous complimentary meals. "Now people have to pay, but the food is much larger, and is of high quality 
and quantity, so less people complain," he says.
Some European airlines, of course, continue to maintain high service standards. Upstarts Eos Airlines and MAXjet 
Airways have challenged mainline carriers over the past year, and as a result, high-end services across the Atlantic 
have gotten an injection. Air France continues to serve free champagne on all long-haul flights. And Lufthansa 
serves all meals free of charge, as long as the flight is long enough for a meal service.
Business-class services on the European carriers are also getting upgrades, as the competition to lure and retain 
the big spenders intensifies. Austrian, for example, has hired an in-flight chef to serve its business-class 
passengers on long-haul routes. The carrier has also introduced "Viennese coffee service" on its business class, 
which pairs a choice between 11 coffees with dessert. Swiss is running regional specialties in first and business 
class, and includes a dinner such as sea bream in Noilly Pratt sauce, followed by a "nidelzeltli parfait" for dessert 
(caramel specialty with spiced plums).
Still, some fliers say that service is slipping in business class, too. Thomas Amberg, who frequently flies Swiss' 
business-class, says the quality of the food has declined in recent years. "Business class food is what economy 
food used to be 15 years ago," says the 40-year-old financial analyst from Bassersdorf, Switz. "But it's still much 
superior to domestic first class in the U.S."
A Swiss spokeswoman said, "We continually monitor our in-flight food service, welcome customer feedback and 
take measures to improve our service accordingly based on input from our customers."
Some airlines are finding that their cost-cutting policies are sparking a consumer backlash. Swiss International Air 
Lines Ltd. tried charging for food on short flights in 2003. But last year the airline reversed its decision after some 
passengers complained. Sarah Klatt-Walsh, Swiss' head of product development and management, said the 
concept especially annoyed travelers flying economy class on business trips and passengers flying long distances 
from Asia and the Middle East. Now, all of its food is complimentary again.
European airlines get stingy
Still, the new free food isn't always what it used to be. Before 2003, Swiss passengers used to get hot or cold meals 
on a tray on flights over about an hour and a half. A meal could include a salad and cold cuts, dessert and a warm 
roll. Now the free meal on that route is most often a cold sandwich.
The changes bother Kurt Renold, a 54-year-old hotel manager in Amsterdam, who flies on Swiss about once a 
month. He says that the new free food is a welcome improvement over the paid service, since he very rarely was 
willing to spend money on the in-flight food. However, he says that the quality of what is now served free can't 
compare with the meals he used to get on the carrier. "Now, it's tasteless sandwiches that are packaged to keep for 
days. The sandwiches used to be crispy and fresh and good," he says.

Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Wednesday he was "rigorously opposed" to a new airline monopoly that could 
emerge if Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus is successful.
The Irish government, which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, is against Ryanair Holding PLC's 1.48 
billion euro ($1.9 billion) hostile takeover attempt.
"As an island nation, Ireland needs a range of competitive air services serving different markets and needs," Ahern 
told reporters in Brussels after he met with EU officials.
EU antitrust regulators are currently examining if the deal could cause problems and must rule by Dec. 6. They can 
refer the case to the Irish competition authority if they believe the companies have two-thirds of their sales in that 
country.
The deal is likely to face careful scrutiny from regulators because the two control over 70 percent of the Irish short-
haul market.
Ryanair says it competes directly against Aer Lingus Group PLC on 17 out of 500 routes but analysts say that 
number is higher if cities, rather than airports, are used to define routes. Ryanair usually flies to smaller airports 
farther away from the city destination, using shuttle buses to connect the two.
If the deal goes ahead, the airlines may be forced to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Dublin hub. 
Regulators demanded that Air France SA and the Netherlands' KLM give up slots at their home airports of Paris 
and Amsterdam when they merged in 2004. Lufthansa AG and Swiss also had to make similar concessions last 
year.

Body
Pharmaceutical group Elan dragged a sluggish Dublin market into the red today as it continues its recent bad run 
after announcing worse than expected results for the third quarter last month.
The firm, which reintroduced Tysabri for multiple sclerosis in July, said last month that its third-quarter loss widened 
on lower sales of the antibiotic Maxipime and increased administrative costs. The net loss widened to USD117m, or 
27 cents a share, from a loss of USD67.1m, or 16 cents, a year earlier.
Its shares dropped by 44c today to 1095.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 15.32 points lower on 8705.08, having closed at a record high the previous 
day. A negative start on Wall Street also failed to lift investor sentiment in Dublin after the Democrats scored a huge 
victory in congressional elections, raising questions about how sympathetic the federal government will be toward 
business. Investors had largely expected the Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives, but still 
undecided Senate races in Montana and Virginia left the leadership of that house unclear - creating the type of 
uncertainty investors dislike. Back in Dublin, the financials were largely higher, with Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of 
Ireland both in the black, tacking on 12c to 14.71 and 10c to 15.95 respectively, while Irish Life and Permanent 
jumped 11c to 18.86. Shares in Ireland's biggest bank, AIB, bucked the trend however, falling 14c to 21.56. Shares 
in Aer Lingus fell 5c to 2.79 after the president of the European Commission told the Taoiseach today that he will 
decide his stance on Ryanair's attempted takeover of Aer Lingus early next month. The Taoiseach told Jose 
Manuel Barroso that the Irish Government believes the bid contravenes EU competition law. Bertie Ahern also said 
that the takeover would not be in the best interests of either the consumer or the market. Mr Barroso said that 
competition was key to the sector. "It's amazing the landscape of air transport competition today when compared to 
the situation some years before. We, the European Commission, are absolutely committed to competition, namely 
in this very successful sector," he said. Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair were in positive territory again, climbing 6c to 
9.51, as it continues its roadshow through the US and Europe. The no frills airline's share prices has now gained

almost 34pc since August 21. Elsewhere on the market, shares in Kingspan were hit by profit taking, down 10c to 
16.50, while CRH fell 28c to 27.52. Grafton managed to record modest gains, climbing 12c to 11.65, while 
McInerney was unchanged on 13.10. Veris, which last week changed its name from Irish Estates, was amongst the 
notable fallers today, down 15c to 4.60. Irish Continental was also in the red, slipping 32c to 13.08, while C&C shed 
27cto 12.68. Those fallers outweighed sharp gains in ICON and IAWS who jumped 95c to 30.27 and 70c to 17.80 
respectively.

Sir Terry Leahy rarely appears in advertisements, so when posters bearing the likeness of the Tesco chief 
executive recently appeared, passers-by might have supposed they had something to do with the supermarket's 
record-breaking financial performance. On closer examination, though, it was clear they were giving Sir Terry a 
warning. "George is watching you," read the menacing strapline.
The George in question is George Monbiot, a veteran environmental campaigner and author of several books. His 
book presents a powerful case for climate catastrophe.
Climate change has risen to the top of the UK political agenda in the past week following the publication of the 
Stern review of the economics of climate change, which suggested that we have a choice between paying a 
relatively small amount now for the safety of the planet or a very large amount later.
Sir Nicholas Stern recommended urgent action to reduce emissions to avoid running the world into economic as 
well as climatic meltdown. Monbiot goes much further, arguing that we should cut carbon emissions by 90 per cent 
by 2030. What's more, however, he shows that such cuts are feasible without massively reducing our quality of life.
As the advertising campaign indicated, in large part this book is a broadside aimed at the business community, who 
are roundly criticised for failing to take action on climate change.
But rather than focus on the likes of Exxon or Ryanair, whose utterances have been dismissive of 
environmentalists, or companies that have kept quiet on the issue, Monbiot has selected companies and business 
figures who have been vocal in support of action on climate change. Sir Terry Leahy cast himself as a green 
champion earlier this year by declaring Tesco would cut emissions and set up a fund devoted to low-carbon 
technology. Sir Richard Branson, who promised to invest the profits of his airlines in low-carbon technology, also

figures. Even the saintly Chris Martin, frontman of the band Coldplay, who has campaigned on anti-poverty and 
environmental issues, comes in for a roasting.
For Monbiot, the statements of these figures belie the truth that they are bent on destroying the planet. As he says 
on his website, turnuptheheat.org: "Few corporations or public figures are now stupid enough to deny that climate 
change is happening, or that we need to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. Instead, most of them now 
claim to be on the side of the angels. They make public statements or publish reports designed to persuade us that 
they are 'working towards sustainability'."
These people, says Monbiot, are the ones we should be looking out for: "The people who will destroy the 
ecosystem are not only sneering industrialists in pinstriped suits, but nice-looking people in open-necked shirts."
So Sir Richard gets it in the neck for running an airline, and Sir Terry because he still sells inefficient lightbulbs. Mr 
Martin has foolishly admitted that he flies by private jet whenever possible, prizing the privacy this gives him.
Clearly, Monbiot is right to expose hypocrisy and the wide disparity between what people profess and their actions.
But it is difficult to see how any business that attempted to improve its environmental performance without 
immediately plunging into losses would win praise from Monbiot.
If Monbiot's intention is to change the minds or behaviour of the business community, this book will not achieve it. 
Anyone in business who does not think climate change is happening or that British businesses should bear any 
responsibility for reducing the world's emissions is unlikely to be persuaded by what they read here. Those most 
likely to read it are already engaged in combating climate change or wish to become so.
Thanks to Monbiot's thorough disapproval of any company foolish enough to express green intentions, the 
message businesspeople will take away is that you are damned if you don't try to take a stand on the environment 
and damned if you do.
For all this, the book is well-researched and worth reading for the detailed technical analysis showing just how 
Britain could cut its greenhouse gas output and still enjoy the comforts of modern life. We have grown so profligate 
in our use of energy, he points out, that we do not even notice our waste. Supermarket chillers, for instance, 
compete with heated aisles, resulting in enormous wasted energy.
Monbiot has done a good job on the arguments but does not seem the man to persuade businesspeople on the 
environment. Is there anyone who could?
Well, Tony Blair is going to have some free time soon.

Body
Ryanair has been ordered to pull a TV ad campaign offering 'free' flights in the UK by Britain's Advertising 
Standards Authority.
The budget airline's fare didn't include non-optional extra taxes and charges, the Advertising Standards ASA said.
Those costs ranged from £11.70 (E17.50) to £21.70 (E32.40) across 20 UK airports.
The advert featured large on-screen text which stated: "4 million seats £0 fare". A voice-over said: "Ryanair, 
Britain's biggest passenger airline, has released four million zero fare seats on its website in an amazing autumn 
sale." It added: "All fares under this offer are zero. Only taxes and charges are payable and we guarantee no fuel 
surcharges." Monarch Airlines complained to the ASA about the commercial. After an investigation, the industry 
watchdog found Ryanair in breach of advertising rules relating to pricing requirements. It said the lowest amount 
payable under the terms of the promotion was £11.70. For that reason the airline could have said seats cost "from" 
that amount - and made clear that the charge varied according to the different airports.

Kingspan drove the Dublin market to a new record closing high today after it confirmed earlier in the week that it 
has dropped its bid for insulation firm Xtratherm.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 89.54 points higher on 8720.40.
Kingspan was a notable gainer, up 31c to 16.61, following its announcement on Monday that it has withdrawn from 
its proposed acquisition of UK and Ireland-based insulation board manufacturer Xtratherm. Kingspan had agreed in 
June to buy the firm for E87m but was last month refused clearance by the Competition Authority.
 Elsewhere in the sector, the mood was not so bright with CRH down 21c to 27.79, Grafton down 1c to 11.54 and 
McInerney unchanged on 13.10. Market sentiment was given a boost in the afternoon today by a strong start on 
Wall Street, where US stocks jumped on encouraging corporate news and economic optimism. This data helped 
ease market jitters over the outcome of mid-term elections, dealers said. Traders were betting on a strong 
Republican performance as America went to the polls. 'Wall Street typically favours a Republican White House and 
would not welcome a change in power in Congress,' one dealer said. Back in Dublin, AIB was the most notable 
mover in the banking sector, climbing an impressive 40c to 21.50. Bank of Ireland also nudged higher, up 18c to 
15.78, while Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 15c to 14.60. Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend, falling 9c to 18.76. 
Shares in property firm Blackrock were down 1c to 0.38c after it confirmed the purchase of a large industrial 
investment property in Santry, Dublin for around E10m, including costs. The building is situated within Woodford 
Business Park which is 7km north of Dublin city, 2km from Dublin airport and close to Dublin Port Tunnel, M50 and 
M1. Blackrock says that given its prime location, the property is well positioned to generate attractive levels of 
income while at the same time offering longer term redevelopment potential. Elsewhere, shares in pharmaceutical 
group Elan recovered in late trading to finish 18c higher on 11.33, while drinks and snacks group C&C tacked on 
21c to 12.90. Shares in Greencore recovered after Monday's falls, up 3c to 4.08. After jumping almost 4pc in Dublin 
on Monday, shares in Ryanair were in the black again today, up 15c to 9.43. The budget carrier announced on 
ISEQ soars 89pts to record closing high
Monday that profits increased by 39pc to E329m in the six months to September. The airline reported net profit of 
E213m for the three months to the end of September, E3m above the E210m figure that had been predicted by 
analysts. Following the announcement, Ryanair's colourful leader, Michael O'Leary all but conceded defeat in its 
takeover bid for Aer Lingus. Shares in Aer Lingus closed 2c lower on 2.84 today. Other notable movers included 
IAWS, up 19c to 17.19, Kerry Group, up 13c to 19.33, and Newcourt, up 10c to 1.54. Shares in Paddy Power 
tacked on 8c to close on 15.18.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, stands to collect at least Euros 10m (Pounds 6.7m) should the low-
cost carrier decide to go ahead with plans to return some of its cashpile to investors.
Mr O'Leary, who holds a 5 per cent stake in the Dublin-based airline, yesterday said Ryanair was looking into a 
number of options for returning "a couple of hundred million euros" to shareholders. These include an annual 
dividend policy, or a share buy-back programme, or a one-off special dividend.
"I'd expect to do one of those things by the end of 2007 calendar year,'' said the 45-year old chief executive, adding 
that the cash return, should there be one, will proceed regardless of whether his bid for rival Aer Lingus goes 
through.
A dividend pay-out would be a first for Ryanair shareholders. Despite amassing cash resources of Euros 2bn, 
including Euros 460m in net cash, the company has shunned the idea of returning cash to investors, arguing that 
the money will be better used to pursue organic growth.
In 2003, Mr O'Leary famously declared: "We are never paying a dividend as long as I live and breathe and as long 
as I'm the largest individual shareholder."
Yesterday's news is likely to appease investors, especially those who have been questioning the financial logic 
behind Mr O'Leary's Pounds 1bn approach for Aer Lingus. "The timing suggests that Ryanair might be trying to 
quell investor discontent," said one analyst.
The bid for the Irish flag carrier has surprised many in the industry because it is such a radical departure from the 
low-cost, low-fare discipline that has seen Mr O'Leary make Ryanair one of the world's most profitable carriers.
Mr O'Leary spoke as Ryanair unveiled another set of forecast-beating first-half figures and upgraded its outlook for 
the full year.
UK AND IRELAND : Investors in Ryanair may receive cash TRAVEL & LEISURE
In the six months to the end of September, Ryanair's revenues rose 33 per cent to Euros 1.26bn while pre-tax 
profits increased 38 per cent to Euros 372.2m.
Net profits rose 39 per cent to Euros 329m and earnings per share were 42.67 cents (31.68 cents).
The strong performance came despite a continued rise in the price of fuel, the airline's biggest cost item, which rose 
34 per cent in the second quarter and 42 per cent in the half-year.
The company, which has 437 routes in Europe, said passenger numbers rose by 23 per cent to 22.1m during the 
period as it pursues ambitious growth plans to carry 80m passengers by 2012.
Ryanair also upgraded full-year forecasts. The company now expects full-year net profits to rise 16 per cent to 
Euros 350m, instead of the previous forecast of an 11 per cent rise.
The shares rose 26 cents to reach a new high of Euros 9.26.

Bid rumours and strong earnings reports drove gains for European equity markets yesterday as sentiment 
recovered following last week's losses.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of top European shares gained 1.1 per cent to 1,464.96, its highest close since May 
2001. The index has risen almost 14.8 per cent since January.
Ryanair, the Irish "no-frills" airline, cheered the market with its quarterly earnings, adding that it had used oil-price 
weakness to extend its hedging against fuel costs.
The shares gained 3.6 per cent to Euros 9.28 after the company announced a forecast-beating 23.7 per cent rise in 
second-quarter net profit, and raised its outlook for the full year.
Insurers were among the top performers as brokers were out in force in support of Germany's Allianz following its 
better-than-expected results on Thursday.
Credit Suisse said it was raising its target price from Euros 157 to Euros 171. "The group is to reduce its equity 
leverage over the next 24 months, by selling equities," said analyst Robin Mitra.
"This could not only increase the reported earnings of the group, but also the potential for further share buy-backs."
Allianz shares gained 2.8 per cent to Euros 147.90 as Merrill Lynch, UBS and Lehman Brothers also voiced 
approval.
Investors were banking on Munich Re ahead of its results today. After a quiet hurricane season in the Caribbean, 
the German reinsurer was expected to announce a near-50 per cent rise in third-quarter net profit.
Domestic rival Hannover Re gained 2.57 per cent to Euros 33.94, while Swiss Re gained 2.71 per cent to SFr106.
Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, was up 2.9 per cent to NKr81.30 on speculation that Iceland's Kaupthing Bank 
would use the proceeds from a new share issue to increase its stake.

Kaupthing, which could issue shares worth about Euros 640m at current values, already owns 7.8 per cent of 
Storebrand.
Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena climbed on reports that ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, could be interested in the 
Italian bank.
Monte Paschi gained 3.5 per cent to Euros 4.95 in spite of denials from Augusto Fantozzi, chairman of ABN's Italian 
unit Antonveneta, that he had indicated it as a specific target. ABN shares gained 1.1 per cent to Euros 23.02.
Merrill Lynch upgraded Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever from "sell" to "neutral" following better-than-
expected third-quarter results last week.
The broker said the numbers represented the "first signs of recovery", as it also raised its 2007-08 earnings per 
share forecast by 5 per cent. Unilever's Amsterdam-listed shares rose 2.4 per cent to Euros 20.20.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, appeared to concede the low-cost airline's current bid for Aer Lingus, 
which values the former state carrier at Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 992m), was set to fail. But he refused to say whether 
he would raise the offer or let it lapse.
Mr O'Leary said yesterday that the Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot), which owns 12.58 per cent of Aer 
Lingus, "looks likely to turn us down, in which case it looks unlikely our offer will succeed".
This is the first time he has conceded the current offer of Euros 2.80 a share might be rejected.
With the first closing date for acceptances next Monday, analysts expect Ryanair to extend the offer to allow time 
for Esot to ballot its 4,666 members, 1,200 of whom are former Aer Lingus staff. Esot sent ballot papers and a letter 
to members on Monday.
Mr O'Leary told analysts in London he might be ready to see the offer lapse, which would mean Ryanair would be 
restricted from making another bid for its Irish rival for 12 months.
Mr OLeary said: "If our offer is not accepted by a majority of Aer Lingus shareholders, we will continue to be a 
significant minority shareholder and will exercise whatever influence we can to encourage Aer Lingus to reduce 
costs and offer lower fares which is, we believe, its best strategy for the future."
Ryanair owns 19.2 per cent of Aer Lingus, acquired in a dawn raid in the immediate wake of Aer Lingus' initial 
public offering in late September.
However, Ireland's government, which retains a 25 per cent stake, is against the deal. Bertie Ahern, prime minister, 
repeated over the weekend that the government's stake in Aer Lingus would remain unchanged.
Also opposed are two pilots bodies, which together own almost 4 per cent, and the businessman Denis O'Brien, 
who owns 2.1 per cent. With the Esot holding, this is an effective blocking stake.

Analysts say that if the deal lapses, Ryanair would probably be able to prevent anyone else from making a 
successful bid.

Discount airline easyJet PLC said Tuesday the number of passengers it carried in October rose 7.3 percent.
Total passenger figures rose to 2.9 million, from 2.7 million in September, the company said in a statement. The 
load factor or the amount of capacity taken up by passengers and freight slipped to 83.2 percent from 85.6 percent.
The company raised its full-year profit forecast last month on the back of increased passenger numbers and higher 
ticket prices.
Europe's second largest low-cost airline behind Ryanair Holdings PLC now expects pretax profit for the year ended 
Sept. 30 to be "slightly ahead" of its previous guidance of growth of 40 percent to 50 percent. The airline had a 
pretax profit of 82.6 million pounds ($155US million) last year.
The company is scheduled to report full-year figures on Nov. 14.

It warned, however, that "the market is only likely to start recognising the group's 'cash cow' qualities when words 
become actions".

U.S. stock market futures on Monday headed higher after losses last week, with a cooling off of oil prices helping to 
bring bulls back into the market. Traders also may be taking last-minute positions ahead of Tuesday's mid-term 
elections.
Dow Jones futures were recently up 41 points, S&P 500 futures rose 5.3 points and Nasdaq futures advanced 6 
points.
On Friday, the Dow industrials dropped for the sixth session in a row, as a surge in long-term interest rates and a 
spike in oil prices overshadowed a largely positive October jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 
32.5 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.2 points and the S&P 500 lost 3 points.
But crude oil futures dropped back below $59 a barrel in electronic trading on Monday. December crude declined 
45 cents to $58.69 a barrel.
A number of Federal Reserve members are due to speak Monday, including Chicago Fed President Michael 
Moskow, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pinalto and San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen.
The dollar rose on the Japanese yen and was about level against the euro.
Gold futures slipped $1.50 to $627.70 an ounce.
Earnings releases are due from El Paso, Anadarko Petroleum, XM Satellite and RealNetworks Inc.
Anadarko separately said it's selling Gulf of Mexico assets to Statoil for $901 million.
Also on the deal front, Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts and the private-equity arm of Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $4.6 
billion for the forklift unit of Germany's Linde.
KKR also was in the news after France's Vivendi confirmed it received, and rejected, a takeover approach from the 
private-equity group said to be worth around $50 billion. Vivendi shares declined in Paris on concerns that tax 
issues may make it difficult for the entertainment and telecommunications conglomerate to be bought.

Also on the private-equity front, The Wall Street Journal reported that Merrill Lynch's arm received an informal 
inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies being probed suggest that the Justice Department may 
be examining Ford Motor Co.'s sale of its Hertz rental unit to private-equity buyers.
Elsewhere, ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers Squibb reported mixed Phase III trials of Erbitux to treat colorectal

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Monday second-quarter earnings rose 24 percent as 
sales and average ticket prices rose more than expected.
Net profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to €213.45 million (US$271.29 million) from €172.63 million in the 
same quarter of 2005, the company said in a statement. The number of passengers carried rose 21 percent to 11.5 
million, while the average ticket price rose 6 percent.
Ryanair also revised upward its previous forecasts for profits and ticket prices. The company now expects full-year 
profit to rise 16 percent, up from previous projections of 11 percent, while average ticket prices for the third quarter 
will probably rise between 2 percent and 3 percent, compared with a previous forecast of a 5 percent decline.
Second-quarter sales rose 27 percent to €689.8 million (US$876.7 million), including a 23 percent gain to €87.7 
million (US$11.5 million) in non-ticket business, which includes in-flight food, drinks and shopping.
Ryanair's earnings and forecasts come against a backdrop of continued high fuel costs, which rose 34 percent to 
€169.6 million (US$215.6 million) versus the second quarter of 2005. The company said the cost of salaries also 
rose 38 percent to €57.1 million (US$72.6 million), chiefly because the number of employees rose 30 percent to 
3,881.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Monday second-quarter profits and sales rose more 
strongly than expected as passenger numbers on new routes grew. The company also raised its forecasts for 
coming months.
Net profit for the quarter ending Sept. 30 rose 24 percent to €213.45 million (US$271.29 million) from €172.63 
million in the same quarter of 2005, the company said in a statement. The number of passengers carried rose 21 
percent to 11.5 million, while the average ticket price rose 6 percent.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary plans to launch 130 new routes within the next six months along with three new 
bases in Bremen, Germany, Madrid, Spain, and Marseilles, southern France.
O'Leary expects full-year net profit to rise 16 percent to €350 million (US$445 million), up from previous projections 
of 11 percent, while average ticket prices for the third quarter will rise between 2 percent and 3 percent, compared 
with a previous forecast of a 5 percent decline.
"The Ryanair lowest-fare model has repeatedly proven that it can generate increased profitability and significant 
passenger growth during difficult trading conditions while many of our competitors are struggling to deliver profits or 
are losing money," O'Leary said.
In Dublin, Ryanair shares rose €0.32 (US$0.43), or 3.6 percent, to close at €9.28 (US$11.80).
Second-quarter sales rose 27 percent to €689.8 million (US$876.7 million), including a 23 percent gain to €87.7 
million (US$11.5 million) in non-ticket business, which includes in-flight food, drinks and shopping.
Ryanair's earnings and forecasts come against a backdrop of continued high fuel costs, which rose 34 percent to 
€169.6 million (US$215.6 million) versus the second quarter of 2005. The company said the cost of salaries also 
rose 38 percent to €57.1 million (US$72.6 million), chiefly because the number of employees rose 30 percent to 
3,881.
Ryanair shares rise as 2nd-quarter profit increases 24 percent
O'Leary reiterated Ryanair's interest in buying Irish rival Aer Lingus in a deal valued at €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion). 
Its hostile takeover bid, launched Oct. 5 barely a week after the government sold its majority state in Aer Lingus, 
has run into considerable opposition from shareholder groups.
One pivotal player, an employee share-ownership trust representing 4,700 current and former Aer Lingus 
employees, holds a 12.59 percent stake. On Sunday, in its first public comment on the takeover bid, the Employee 
Share Ownership Trust questioned whether the deal made good sense for the trust.
"It looks likely they're going to turn us down," O'Leary said, "in which case it looks unlikely our offer will succeed."
Aer Lingus shares have remained above Ryanair's all-cash offer of €2.80 (US$3.55) a share in expectation that 
Ryanair will raise its bid to secure the required 50 percent of shares. Ryanair is legally barred from building its 
current 19.2 percent stake until the Aer Lingus share price falls back to €2.80 (US$3.56).
Aer Lingus shares slipped 1 cent to close at €2.86 (US$3.63) Monday amid declining expectations of a Ryanair 
takeover.

U.S. stocks on Monday headed higher after losses last week, with a cooling off of oil prices helping to bring bulls 
back into the market. Traders also may be taking last-minute positions ahead of Tuesday's mid-term elections.
In the opening minutes, the Dow Jones industrials gained .08 of a point to 11,986.12, the S&P 500 rose .06 of a 
point to 1,364.36, and the Nasdaq advanced 10.87 points to 2,341.66.
On Friday, the Dow industrials dropped for the sixth session in a row, as a surge in long-term interest rates and a 
spike in oil prices overshadowed a largely positive October jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 
32.5 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.2 points and the S&P 500 lost 3 points.
But crude oil futures dropped back below $59 a barrel in electronic trading on Monday. December crude declined 
45 cents to $58.69 a barrel.
A number of Federal Reserve members are due to speak Monday, including Chicago Fed President Michael 
Moskow, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pinalto and San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen.
The dollar rose on the Japanese yen and was about level against the euro.
Gold futures slipped $1.50 to $627.70 an ounce.
Earnings releases are due from El Paso, Anadarko Petroleum, XM Satellite and RealNetworks Inc.
Anadarko separately said it's selling Gulf of Mexico assets to Statoil for $901 million.
Also on the deal front, Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts and the private-equity arm of Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $4.6 
billion for the forklift unit of Germany's Linde.
KKR also was in the news after France's Vivendi confirmed it received, and rejected, a takeover approach from the 
private-equity group said to be worth around $50 billion. Vivendi shares declined in Paris on concerns that tax 
issues may make it difficult for the entertainment and telecommunications conglomerate to be bought.
Stocks Up Slightly in Opening Minutes
Also on the private-equity front, The Wall Street Journal reported that Merrill Lynch's arm received an informal 
inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies being probed suggest that the Justice Department may 
be examining Ford Motor Co.'s sale of its Hertz rental unit to private-equity buyers.
Elsewhere, ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers Squibb reported mixed Phase III trials of Erbitux to treat colorectal 
cancer. The companies said they will talk to the Food and Drug Administration after the studies.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Monday second-quarter profit and sales rose more 
strongly than expected as passenger numbers on new routes grew. The company also raised its forecasts for 
coming months.
Net profit for the quarter ending Sept. 30 rose 24 percent to 213.45 million euros ($271.29 million) from 172.63 
million euros in the same quarter of 2005, the company said in a statement. The number of passengers carried rose 
21 percent to 11.5 million, while the average ticket price rose 6 percent.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary plans to launch 130 new routes within the next six months along with three new 
bases in Bremen, Germany; Madrid, Spain; and Marseilles, southern France.
O'Leary expects full-year net profit to rise 16 percent to 350 million euros ($445 million), up from previous 
projections of 11 percent growth. Average ticket prices for the third quarter are expected to rise between 2 percent 
and 3 percent, compared with a previous forecast of a 5 percent decline.
"The Ryanair lowest-fare model has repeatedly proven that it can generate increased profitability and significant 
passenger growth during difficult trading conditions while many of our competitors are struggling to deliver profits or 
are losing money," O'Leary said.
In Dublin, Ryanair shares rose 0.34 euro cents (43 cents), or 3.8 percent, to reach a 52-week high of 9.30 euros 
($11.82).
Second-quarter sales rose 27 percent to 689.8 million euros ($876.7 million), including a 23 percent gain to 87.7

Lingus, has run into considerable opposition from shareholder groups.
O'Leary said Ryanair would retain its current 19.2 percent stake in Aer Lingus if a pivotal shareholder effectively 
blocks the deal.
"We will continue to be a significant minority shareholder, and will exercise whatever influence we can to encourage 
Aer Lingus to reduce costs and offer lower fares which is, we believe, its best strategy for the future," O'Leary said.

Body
Shares in Ryanair found their wings this morning, soaring almost 4pc, after the no-frills airline announced that 
profits increased by 39pc to E329m in the six months to September.
At 11.00 the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 38.78 points at 8582.93.
Ryanair was the mornings' star performer, climbing 34c to 9.30. The shares found favour with investors after the 
airline reported net profit of E213m for the three months to the end of September, E3m above the E210m figure that 
had been predicted by analysts.
 The Michael O'Leary led airline also revised upwards its expectations for the full year. It said it was more optimistic 
about the winter period and now expects a 16pc increase in full year net profit after tax to E350m. Ryanair had 
previously forecast an 11pc rise. Shares in its takeover target Aer Lingus slipped back this morning, however, down 
3c to 2.84 as its employees prepare to vote on the takeover bid by Ryanair. Voting papers were issued to the 4,665 
members of the trust (ESOT) on Friday and they now must decide whether to sell or hold all the shares. The vote is 
likely to decide whether Ryanair bid succeeds or fails. The company's biggest union, SIPTU, has recommended 
rejection. AIB led the way in the financial sector, climbing 14c to 20.93, after it last week denied reports that it is set 
to sell its minority stake in Goodbody Stockbrokers. Elsewhere in the sector, Bank of Ireland was down 3c to 15.52, 
while Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 5c to 14.32 and Irish Life and Permanent was fell 15c to 18.85. CRH was in the 
black this morning, up 17c to 27.64, while Grafton fell 11c to 11.53. McInerney and Kingspan both also slipped into 
the red, falling 5c to 13.10 and 6c to 16.40 respectively. Other notable movers this morning included South Wharf, 
up 10c to 7.00, Readymix, up 3c to 2.55, Elan, up 17c to 11.18, and FBD Holdings, down 51c to 39.49.

Shares in Ryanair found their wings today, soaring almost 4pc, after the no-frills airline announced that profits 
increased by 39pc to E329m in the six months to September.
The airline led a buoyant ISEQ index of Irish shares 86.71 points higher to 8630.86.

previously forecast an 11pc rise. Meanwhile, an admission by Mr O'Leary that its bid for Aer Lingus is unlikely to 
succeed if the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) votes against the deal, had little impact on shares today. 
The colourful leader said that if the bid was unsuccessful, it still remain a vocal minority shareholder in the flag 
carrier. Should ESOT members back the bid, Mr O'Leary said he was confident that European competition 
authorities would clear the deal with conditions. It was also announced at the press call that Ryanair is planning to 
return cash to shareholders by the end of the 2007 calendar year - the first cash return ever made by the airline. 
Shares in Aer Lingus closed 1c lower on 2.86 in Dublin today. AIB led the way in the financial sector, climbing 32c 
to 21.10, after it last week denied reports that it is set to sell its minority stake in Goodbody Stockbrokers. 
Elsewhere in the sector, Bank of Ireland was up 5c to 15.60, while Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 8c to 14.35. Irish Life

climbed 14c to 12.54, regaining some of last weeks losses. Greencore was in negative territory, down 3c to 4.05, on 
a day when ex-employees gathered outside its head office in Dublin to protesting that Greencore has ignored a 
recommendation from the Labour Court awarding union members significantly improved redundancy terms. 
Elsewhere, Dragon Oil was up 6c to 2.38 after it announced last month that average gross production since July 
has grown by 14pc to 21,113 barrels of oil per day.

Ryanair plans two-for-one stock split

Body
Ryanair has reported a better-than-expected 39pc increase in first half profit after tax and raised its guidance for full 
year earnings.
The carrier also announced plans to seek shareholder approval for a two-for-one stock split at the extraordinary 
general meeting to be held in December on the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.
For the six months to Sept 30 Ryanair made record profit after tax of E329 m, up from E237 m last time, giving 
earnings per share of 42.67 cent, up 38pc.
 The group said it remains cautious about its second half due to substantial capacity expansion and higher oil 
prices. However, it still raised its guidance for year to end-March 2007 net profit after tax - it now expects a rise of 
16pc to E350 m, up from previous guidance of E335 m. Ryanair is now forecasting third quarter yields up 2-3pc 
compared to its original forecast of a 5pc decline. It reckons that fourth quarter yields may be 'slightly lower' but not 
as much as the 5pc decline it previously guided. Accordingly the airline expects yields to be flat over the winter 
period although second half net profit is still forecast to be lower than last year. First half revenue rose 33pc to 
E1.26bn, reflecting a 23pc increase in passenger numbers to 22.1m and a 9pc increase in yields, offsetting a 7.5pc 
rise in unit costs, primarily a 42pc hike in the fuel bill to E337m. After tax margins rose 1 percentage point to 26pc. 
Some 42 new routes were launched and three new bases opened. Ancillary revenue grew 27pc, faster than the 
growth in passenger volumes. 'Ryanair has again delivered record half year profits despite intense competition and 
very high fuel prices,' said chief executive Michael O'Leary. 'The Ryanair lowest fare model has repeatedly proven 
that it can generate increased profitability and significant passenger growth during difficult trading conditions while 
many of our competitors are struggling to deliver profits or are losing money.' The CEO noted the 9pc rise in 
summer yields was achieved despite a 22pc increase in seat capacity. 'This benign yield environment continues to 
be driven by the multiple fuel surcharges imposed by European flag carriers, which has widened the gap between 
their high fares and Ryanair's lowest fares,' he said. For the remainder of the current year Ryanair is 90pc hedged 
Ryanair plans two-for-one stock split
at rates equivalent to USD73 per barrel. Having taken advantage of recent weakness in forward prices it is 50pc 
hedged for the quarter from October to December 2007 at a cost 10pc lower than the comparable third quarter this 
year. The group plans to double in size to over 80m passengers by 2012. In October it exercised options for 32 
Boeing 737-800 next-generation aircraft for delivery by June 2009. Ryanair has amassed a 19.2pc stake in Aer 
Lingus and is targeting the 50.1pc holding that will give it management control. However, opponents of the bid hold 
already some 46.6pc - the Irish government with 25.4pc, the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) 
with 12.6pc, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3pc, the Tailwind employees/pilots group with 4.2pc, and telecoms tycoon 
Denis O'Brien with 2.1pc - making the arithmetic difficult for Ryanair. The airline said today that if its offer is not 
accepted by a majority of Aer Lingus shareholders it will continue to be a significant minority shareholder.

Profit record for Ryanair as it awaits regulatory ruling on Aer Lingus bid

Low-fares airline Ryanair has once again flown against intense competition and higher fuel charges to post record 
profits.
Some airlines are struggling and others are losing money, but Ryanair has increased its traffic to become the first 
European budget airline to carry four million passengers a month.
But true to form, chief executive Michael O'Leary uses the interim results to talk up Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, 
attack the Irish government for its Dublin airport plans, and criticise the British Airports Authority for a £4 billion 
'gold-plated Taj Mahal' at Stansted. He believes it could be built for a quarter of the cost.
Ryanair (RYA) carried 22.1 million passengers in the six months to 30 September, 23% more than last year's 18 
million. Passenger yields in the summer increased 9% and total revenue 33% to 1.26 billion (£846 million) from 
946.2 million (£635 million) in the first half of 2005.
As some of its rivals have imposed fuel surcharges on top of fares that are already higher than Ryanair's, the price 
gap has widened allowing it 'to deliver rapid traffic growth and generate higher profits', O'Leary said.
Unit costs increased 7.5%, largely because of fuel, staff and airport handling costs. Fuel costs rose 42% to 337 
million, but the after tax profit margin still rose from 25.9% to 26%. Net profit rose 39% to 329 million.
Profit before tax for the half year rose to 372.2 million from 269.5 million, up 38%. For the three months to 30 
September it was 26% up at 243.6 million against 192.6 million last time. The shares added 0.302 to 9.302.
After acquiring a 19.2% stake in Aer Lingus (AERL), on 5 October Ryanair launched a cash offer worth 2.80 a share 
valuing the recently privatised group at 1.48 billion.
'The combination of Aer Lingus and Ryanair into one strong Irish airline group will be rewarding for consumers and 
will enable us both to vigorously compete with the mega carriers in Europe' said O'Leary.
He says the European regulatory authorities are expected to make a decision before the end of the year. If the 
Ryanair bid fails, O'Leary says the group will keep its shares and exert what influence it can on Aer Lingus to 
reduce costs and offer lower fares.
Profit record for Ryanair as it awaits regulatory ruling on Aer Lingus bid
During the summer Ryanair added 42 new routes and three new bases at Liverpool, East Midlands and Shannon. 
These took the total number of routes to 437 in 24 countries and the bases to 18.
Ryanair is 90% hedged on fuel at rates equivalent to $73 per barrel. The recent lower oil prices have allowed it 
hedge 50% of its requirements for the quarter from October to December 2007, 10% lower than the comparable 
quarter this year.
O'Leary is cautious looking ahead, but he is expecting significant traffic growth from 130 new routes and three new 
bases in Marseilles, Bremen and Madrid. Yields in the third quarter are expected to be up by between 2-3% 
compared to the original forecast of falling 5%. The four-quarter yields might be lower, but not by as much as 5%.
Net profit for the second half will be lower than last year, but the increase for the year should still be up 16% at 350 
million, higher than the previous indication of 335 million, up 11%.
The airline wants to split each of its shares into two to improve the marketability of the stock. It hopes that this will 
be passed at an extraordinary general meeting in December.
Broker Collins Stewart is a buyer of Ryanair whether or not the Aer Lingus bid succeeds. Although fuel costs have 
dampened the returns to around 15.4%, these 'should begin to rise again as this cost pressures eases' it said.
Planning approval has been given at Dublin airport for a second terminal at a cost of 750 million, 4.5 times more 
than the 170 million cost revealed 11 months earlier in September 2005.
O'Leary says only a government-owned monopoly would seek a cost increase of over four fold with no increase in 
passenger capacity. It means that costs at Dublin are rising by an 'outrageous' 60%. Ryanair will continue to 
oppose the scheme and has appealed the planning decision.
BAA, O'Leary says, is a monopoly that will continue to build facilities that do not meet the needs of users and says 
until there is competition between the three London airports, charges will keep rising and passengers will suffer 
from insufficient facilities. He is particularly concerned about the continuing under staffing of security at Stansted 
that has led to repeated delays
'The management of Stansted security is inept, and the BAA has again proven that it is incapable of providing 
adequate or appropriate security services at Stansted. This shambles again highlights that the BAA is an inefficient, 
incompetent airport monopoly which should be broken up,' he said

No frills airline, Ryanair, has posted a stronger-than-expected 23.7pc rise in second-quarter net income today and 
revised upwards its guidance for the full year on an improved outlook for the winter period.

the E210 million average of six analysts' forecasts compiled by Reuters.
It said that it now expected a 16pc increase in full-year net profit after tax to E350 million compared to previous 
guidance of an 11 per cent rise.
 Traffic grew by 23pc to 22.1 million passengers, while yields increased by 9 per cent. The airline said total 
revenues rose by 33 per cent to E1.256 billion. Unit costs increased by 7.5pc as fuel costs rose by 42pc to E337

Highlight: Ryanair today admitted its bid for Aer Lingus is likely to fail if the ESOT votes against the deal.
Body
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary today admitted that his airline's takeover bid for Aer Lingus is likely to fail 
if the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) votes against the deal
Speaking at a news conference to announce Ryanair's first half figures, the colourful leader said that if the bid was 
unsuccessful, it still remain as a vocal minority shareholder in the flag carrier.
It said that it would continue to call for reduced costs and lower fares at Aer Lingus.
 When asked whether he would consider submitting an improved offer, should the bid be rejected, he said that 
takeover panel rules prohibited him from indicating whether or not this would be the case. Should ESOT members 
back the bid, Mr O'Leary said he was confident that European competition authorities would clear the deal with 
conditions. It was also announced at the press call that Ryanair is planning to return cash to shareholders by the 
end of the 2007 calendar year - the first cash return ever made by the airline.

Highlight: Esot warned that accepting Ryanair's offer for the airline could jeopardise the group's ability to repay 
debt.
Body
The staff shareholding group at Aer Lingus has warned its members that accepting Ryanair's E1.4 billion offer for 
the airline could jeopardise the group's ability to repay debt of E35 million it incurred in order to purchase shares in 
Aer Lingus.
The board of the Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot) said it had concerns as to how the profits of Aer Lingus 
would be reported if Ryanair was to acquire the company and how the Esot's entitlement to a share of those profits 
would be calculated.
The Esot, which has begun balloting its members on the Ryanair bid, was intending to use a new profit share 
agreement with Aer Lingus to repay borrowing costs of around E35 million that it incurred to purchase 15.5 million 
shares at E2.20 each from the Government under an option agreement entered into before the initial public offer.

Everything has its price. But not, perhaps, Aer Lingus, which published its defence against a bid by Ryanair 
yesterday. Ryanair's Euros 2.80-a-share bid has always looked mean. It values Aer Lingus among the cheapest of 
its European peers, based on enterprise value to next year's estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and rentals. Yet its 21 per cent ebitda margin makes it Europe's second most profitable airline after 
Ryanair.
Estimates of its break-up value also justify a higher bid. The Irish carrier's fleet could be sold; some Heathrow slots 
could be disposed of; and it has Euros 470m net cash. Shareholders should not accept less than Euros 3 a share.
Nearly half of Aer Lingus investors, though, seem unlikely to accept even a significantly higher offer. Employees 
hold 19 per cent of the shares. Many are unenthusiastic about working for Ryanair rather than the highly unionised 
Aer Lingus. Even the prospect of receiving, on average, Euros 39,000 (pre-tax) from the sale of their stake does not 
seem to be an incentive. The government, which owns 25 per cent, does not want a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus for 
a potent mixture of reasons. The 47 per cent stake pro-management investors hold is not enough to block Ryanair's 
ambitions. But it is certainly enough to make price only one of the factors that will determine the bid's success.

The Aer Lingus workers' trust, which owns 12.58 per cent of the airline, is to start balloting its members next week 
on whether they accept the terms of Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 990m) hostile takeover offer.
The seven trustees of the Employee Share Ownership Trust will tomorrow publish the letter, accompanying a ballot 
paper, they intend to send to each of the trust's 4,666 members or beneficiaries, about 1,200 of whom are former 
employees.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said last week that the bid would probably fail without the backing of the 
ESOT.
Ryanair owns 19.2 per cent, acquired in a dawn raid in the days immediately following Aer Lingus' initial public 
offering in late September. The Irish government, which opposes the bid, retains 25 per cent.
Two bodies representing pilots own slightly less than 4 per cent and Denis O'Brien, a local businessman, bought 
2.1 per cent. Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus's chief executive, was confident yesterday that ESOT would reject the 
offer of Euros 2.80 a share. "The ESOT ballot will speak for itself but I believe it will overwhelmingly reject the 
Ryanair bid - full stop," he said as he launched his company's defence document.
The ESOT trustees include two members from each of the main unions, two from the company, and the trust's 
lawyer.
The Central Representative Council, which liaises between the management and unions, yesterday said: "Staff at 
Aer Lingus are strongly opposed to Ryanair's offer."

Aer Lingus has formally rejected a takeover bid by rival airline Ryanair, telling shareholders in its defense document 
published Friday that the offer places a low value on the formerly state-controlled carrier.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's fastest-growing airline, offered 2.80 euros ($3.57) a share for Aer Lingus Group 
PLC on Oct. 5, just days after its shares were floated on the Irish and British stock exchanges at 2.20 euros ($2.81) 
or 27 percent less.
But in a Dublin news conference formally rejecting the offer, Aer Lingus chiefs said the IPO had generated more 
than 500 million euros ($650 million) for the previously cash-poor airline that would allow it to borrow heavily, buy 
new aircraft and rapidly expand its network, particularly into the United States.
They said Ryanair Europe's most rapidly expanding and ruthlessly cost-cutting airline intended to gobble up Aer 
Lingus and create a near-monopoly on air travel in Ireland.
"Ryanair, our principal short-haul competitor, has reacted in a hostile, anticompetitive manner designed to eliminate 
a rival at a derisory price," Aer Lingus Chairman John Sharman said in a statement accompanying the defense 
document.
The defense document said a combined Ryanair-Aer Lingus operation would account for 80 percent of all flights 
between Ireland and other European countries.
"Ryanair claims in its offer document that `because the two airlines will compete vigorously, this will not lead to a 
monopoly.' However, don't be fooled. Even Ryanair's founder and former chairman has admitted that the 
combination would be a monopoly," the document said, referring to Ryanair pioneer Tony Ryan, who launched the 
airline with a single route in 1985.
The Aer Lingus share price has remained firmly above Ryanair's 2.80 euros offer, in expectation that Ryanair will be 
forced to raise its price to secure more than 50 percent of shares, the minimum required for a takeover. Ryanair is 
Aer Lingus rejects takeover bid from no-frills rival Ryanair , saying offer is too low
legally barred from building its Aer Lingus holding, currently exceeding 19 percent, until the shares fall below its 
offer price again.
Ryanair shares rose 0.8 percent to close at 8.99 euros ($11.50) in trading Friday on the Irish Stock Exchange, while 
Aer Lingus shares ended flat at 2.86 euros ($3.65).
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has insisted he won't raise his bid but concedes that a successful 
takeover probably depends on the 11 percent of shares controlled by a trust of 4,700 current and former Aer Lingus 
employees. That trust has reserved its position publicly.
Already ranged against the hostile takeover are the government, which retained a 25.4 percent holding; two 
investment funds operated on behalf of Aer Lingus pilots accounting for about 4 percent of shares; and Irish 
telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien, who bought 2.1 percent of shares explicitly to complicate Ryanair's move.
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said his company was fundamentally opposed to a merger with 
Ryanair, even if it raises its price.
"I cannot conceive of the circumstances where the Aer Lingus management and Ryanair would be able to work 
harmoniously together," Mannion said in an interview. "This is simply a reflection of the fact that these organizations 
have been competing head to head, without fear or favor, for 20 years.
"It would be like merging Manchester United and Liverpool football clubs," he said. "You just wouldn't do it."
Mannion noted that Ryanair had no experience of working constructively with labor unions, which are powerful 
inside Aer Lingus, or of operating long-haul routes, which require higher levels of expense and service.
He said Aer Lingus was focused on competing with Ryanair in Europe and with U.S. airlines on trans-Atlantic routes 
in expectation of exploiting an eventual "open skies" agreement between the United States and European Union. 
Current rules restrict foreign airlines from opening new routes in both Europe and the United States.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus is beefing up its existing U.S. services by expanding its long-haul fleet from seven aircraft to 
nine. Next summer it plans to double its Boston and Chicago routes to twice daily, and raise its current five-day-a-
week Los Angeles service to daily. The airline already flies twice daily to and from Newark, New Jersey.
Aer Lingus was founded by the government in 1936. It came close to bankruptcy in 2002 because of a bloated 
payroll and plummeting business following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The airline managed a swift turnaround by slashing staff nearly in half and moving to a low-frills model emphasizing 
Internet sales and continental European routes Ryanair's formula. Today Aer Lingus connects Ireland to more than 
50 European cities, four U.S. cities, and the Middle East emirate of Dubai.

legally barred from building its Aer Lingus holding, currently exceeding 19 percent, until the shares fall below its 
offer price again.
Ryanair shares rose 0.8 percent to close at 8.99 euros ($11.50) in trading Friday on the Irish Stock Exchange, while 
Aer Lingus shares ended flat at 2.86 euros ($3.65).
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has insisted he won't raise his bid but concedes that a successful 
takeover probably depends on the 11 percent of shares controlled by a trust of 4,700 current and former Aer Lingus 
employees. That trust has reserved its position publicly.
Already ranged against the hostile takeover are the government, which retained a 25.4 percent holding; two 
investment funds operated on behalf of Aer Lingus pilots accounting for about 4 percent of shares; and Irish 
telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien, who bought 2.1 percent of shares explicitly to complicate Ryanair's move.
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said his company was fundamentally opposed to a merger with 
Ryanair, even if it raises its price.
"I cannot conceive of the circumstances where the Aer Lingus management and Ryanair would be able to work 
harmoniously together," Mannion said in an interview. "This is simply a reflection of the fact that these organizations 
have been competing head to head, without fear or favor, for 20 years.
"It would be like merging Manchester United and Liverpool football clubs," he said. "You just wouldn't do it."
Mannion noted that Ryanair had no experience of working constructively with labor unions, which are powerful 
inside Aer Lingus, or of operating long-haul routes, which require higher levels of expense and service.
He said Aer Lingus was focused on competing with Ryanair in Europe and with U.S. airlines on trans-Atlantic routes 
in expectation of exploiting an eventual "open skies" agreement between the United States and European Union. 
Current rules restrict foreign airlines from opening new routes in both Europe and the United States.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus is beefing up its existing U.S. services by expanding its long-haul fleet from seven aircraft to 
nine. Next summer it plans to double its Boston and Chicago routes to twice daily, and raise its current five-day-a-
week Los Angeles service to daily. The airline already flies twice daily to and from Newark, New Jersey.
Aer Lingus was founded by the government in 1936. It came close to bankruptcy in 2002 because of a bloated 
payroll and plummeting business following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The airline managed a swift turnaround by slashing staff nearly in half and moving to a low-frills model emphasizing 
Internet sales and continental European routes Ryanair's formula. Today Aer Lingus connects Ireland to more than 
50 European cities, four U.S. cities, and the Middle East emirate of Dubai.

Financial shares led the Dublin market modestly lower today as markets continued to digest comments from the 
European Central Bank which suggested that it could keep tightening interest rates in 2007.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 23.93 points lower on 8544.15.
After leaving rates unchanged at 3.25pc at its meeting on Thursday, ECB president Jean Claude Trichet all but 
guaranteed an increase at next month's meeting by using the term "strong vigilance". 
 Many analysts are now forecasting that ECB rates will be at 3.75pc at the end of the first quarter of 2007, however, 
they will no await the accompanying statement from the December meeting for further insight into what the bank 
has planned for next. Sentiment was also hit by a negative start on across the Atlantic, where US stocks turned 
weaker at the end of a tough week on Wall Street. Stocks edged lower as investors turned cautious following a 
mixed set of job data, with the unemployment rate reaching five-year lows, while non-farm payrolls missed market 
forecasts. Back in Dublin, Aer Lingus was again in the headlines after it published a detailed rejection of the 
"unwanted" E1.48bn bid from Ryanair. The airline's chief executive, Dermot Mannion, urged shareholders not to sell 
their shares to Ryanair and vowed to defeat any offer from its rival. At a press conference in Dublin, Mr Mannion 
ruled out the possibility of Ryanair's bid being successful, saying he "could not conceive of circumstances where the 
Ryanair offer would be approved by the Aer Lingus board" or where the two airlines would merge. Shares in the 
former state airline closed flat on 2.86. Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair were up 7c to 8.99, after it announced a 23pc 
jump in passenger numbers during October. Financial shares bore the brunt of today's falls, with AIB down 10c to 
20.80, Anglo Irish Bank down 8c to 14.27 and Bank of Ireland down by 1c to 15.55. Irish Life and Permanent was 
the biggest faller in the sector, shedding 21c to 19.00. In the construction sector, CRH closed 13c higher on 27.58, 
while Grafton tacked on 5c to 11.55 and McInerney jumped 5c to 13.15. Kingspan fell for the second consecutive 
day, down 10c to 16.50. Qualceram Shires continued to find favour with investors, up 15c to 1.95. The Irish

bathroom fittings firm announced in September that it returned to profit in the first six months of the year and 
remained upbeat about results for the full year. Since then, shares in the company have risen steadily. Drinks and 
snacks group C and C was a notable faller, down 31c to 12.40, while FBD Holdings fell 10c to 39.35 and Paddy 
Power lost 7c to 15.00. Clinical research firm ICON was in the black today, up 1.07 to 29.32, after it posted a 40pc 
revenue rise for the three months to August. Chairman Dr. John Climax described the period as an "excellent

Body
Aer Lingus has reiterated its rejection of arch-rival Ryanair's hostile bid for the company, describing the E1.48 billion 
offer as 'derisory'.
'Faced with a strong, well-capitalised and independent Aer Lingus, Ryanair, our principal short-haul competitor, has 
reacted in a hostile, anti-competitive manner designed to eliminate a rival at a derisory price,' Aer Lingus chairman 
John Sharman said in the airline's defence document posted to shareholders today.
In the document, Aer Lingus said Ryanair's E2.80 per share bid overlooks its prospects as an independent 
company, and prices the airline at a discount to other European carriers of a similar size.
 The carrier revealed it has set itself a target return of 15pc a year on its investment in new aircraft. The group also 
highlighted the 'significant growth prospects' of its long-haul service to the US, a route not served by Ryanair, which 
currently only operates short-haul services. 'We have excellent growth opportunities and we have the fleet, staff, 
capital resources and management to deliver for shareholders,' Sharman said. Ryanair, led by colourful chief 
executive Michael O'Leary, launched the surprise offer on Oct 5, just eight days after Aer Lingus' initial public 
offering valued the airline at E1.16 billion. The bid was immediately rejected by Aer Lingus' board as 'unsolicited 
and wholly opportunistic'. Ryanair has amassed a 19.2pc stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1pc holding 
that will give it management control. However, opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6pc -- the Irish 
government with 25.4pc, the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6pc, Aer Lingus pilots 
with 2.3pc, the Tailwind employees/pilots group with 4.2pc, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1pc -- making 
the arithmetic difficult for Ryanair. Ryanair reports second-quarter results on Monday.

vowed to defeat any offer from its rival.
At a press conference in Dublin, Mr Mannion ruled out the possibility of Ryanair's bid being successful, saying 
he"could not conceive of circumstances where the Ryanair offer would be approved by the Aer Lingus board" or 
where the two airlines would merge.
He said the board of Aer Lingus is "united as never before to defeat the Ryanair bid in as quick a time as possible".
 Mr Manion made the claims after Aer Lingus had published a detailed rejection of the "unwanted" E1.48bn offer 
from Ryanair. The former state airline said that it did not need any help from Ryanair to drive the airline forward and 
that it had the expertise to grow the airline on its own. When asked about possible job cuts, Mr Mannion said the 
airline would rule nothing in or out as it looks for ways to cut costs. Mr Mannion said he had not heard directly or 
indirectly from telecoms entrepreneur Denis O'Brien or his investors. Last month, Denis O'Brien bought a 2.1pc 
stake in Aer Lingus in a move he said was designed to help block the Ryanair bid. In the rejection document, 
posted out to shareholders today, Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman described the offer as "derisory". "Faced

Body
Members of the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) would gain an average of just E4000 each if 
Ryanair's takeover bid succeeds, according to Aer Lingus unions.
This is the difference between an estimated market value of E2.50 per Aer Lingus share and Ryanair's offer of 
E2.80.
In an addendum to the company's defence document, the Aer Lingus Central Representative Council (CRC), which 
represents all unions in the company, also says the E4000 would have to be held in Ryanair shares instead of cash 
to avoid large tax liabilities.
 The union's say this is a bad deal, not least because Ryanair shares have "significantly underperformed" compared 
to the European airline sector in recent years. The value of Ryanair shares rose just 21pc in the last three years, 
compared by 85pc for the European airline sector as a whole. British Airways shares rose 121pc in the same 
period. The CRC also warns that a Ryanair takeover would massively dilute the staff shareholding, from 14.9pc of 
Aer Lingus to just 3.2pc of Ryanair, substantially weakening the employee voice in the company. It says the Ryanair 
offer document is silent on key issues like profit sharing and the ESOT's right to appoint directors to the board. The 
unions say all share holders will benefit from maintaining an independent Aer Lingus. "The unknown future battles 
between a Ryanair led management team and trade unions and staff are an uncertainty that this already volatile 
industry can do without," it says.

Aer Lingus has announced plans to expand its long-haul flights to the US, ahead of today's publication of its formal 
defence document aimed at thwarting the Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 991m) hostile takeover bid from Ryanair, its larger 
Irish rival.
The defence document is expected to highlight the airline's prospects as a long-haul carrier, which Aer Lingus will 
argue would be imperilled if it were owned by Ryanair.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, said the delivery of two new A330 aircraft in May and June next year, will allow 
the former national carrier to expand capacity by 28 per cent in 2007 on routes to the US and the Middle East.
Ryanair's current bid of Euros 2.80 a share compares with the Euros 2.20 strike price when Aer Lingus was floated 
in late-September. At that time Ireland's government reduced its stake from 85 per cent to about 25.4 per cent.
Ryanair's formal offer, published last week, includes a proposal to allow the members of Aer Lingus' employee 
share ownership trust (Esot), which owns 12.58 per cent of the airline, to take up its cash offer, without paying tax.
The proposal envisages that the trust sell its stake and the individual beneficiaries re-invest the proceeds in Ryanair 
shares, which can then be sold after some months without incurring tax.
Ryanair has suggested that individual Esot members could receive an average of Euros 60,000 if the offer was 
accepted. Aer Lingus disputes this figure.
Ryanair owns 19.6 per cent of the airline following a raid on the market. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, 
has conceded that without the backing of the Esot, Ryanair's bid will probably fail.
Bankers believe Mr O'Leary may have to raise the offer to succeed, given the informal group of shareholders 
capable of blocking the bid. This includes the Irish government with its 25.4 per cent, two pilots bodies that together 
UK AND IRELAND : Long-haul plans central to Aer Lingus TRAVEL & LEISURE
own just less than 4 per cent, and Denis O'Brien, a local telecommunications entrepreneur who has bought 2.1 per 
cent of Aer Lingus.
John Sheehan of NCB calculates Ryanair could raise the offer price as high as Euros 3.72 a share and still make a 
15 per cent return on its net cash outlay.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Friday the number of passengers it carried in October 
rose 23 percent.
Total passenger numbers rose to 3.73 million compared with 3.03 million in the same month in 2005, Ryanair said 
in a statement.
The load factor or the amount of capacity taken up by passengers and freight was 83 percent in the same month 
compared with 85 percent in October 2005.
The company's shares rose 0.5 percent to €8.97 (US$11.44) on the Dublin Stock Exchange.
Ryanair is trying to take over rival Aer Lingus Group PLC. The former Irish state-owned carrier rejected the takeover 
bid on Friday, telling shareholders the offer places an "insultingly" low value on the business.
Ryanair offered €2.80 (US$3.57) a share for Aer Lingus just days after its shares were floated last month for €2.20

Budget airline Ryanair today reported a 23pc increase in passenger traffic during the month of October, carrying 
3.73 million passengers compared with British Airways's 2.06 million UK/ Europe passengers. 
The no- frills airline said that it carried 3.731 million passengers in October compared to 3.025 million a year earlier 
and now claims to be the world's favourite airline. 
In the 12 months to the end of October, the airline carried 39.591 million passengers.
 Announcing the passenger figures, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said, "Ryanair has yet 
again been voted the world's favourite airline by the travelling public, with 3.73M passengers choosing to travel with 
Ryanair during October, more than opted for BA. These figures affirm our position as the UK passengers' favourite, 
as the travelling public continues to enjoy Ryanair's low fares and top punctuality, while spurning BA's high fares, 
late flights and fuel surcharges in the survey that counts". However, Ryanair said its load factor -- the number of 
passengers as a proportion of available seats -- dipped to 83pc in October from 85pc a year earlier.

sector, McInerney was in the red, falling 10c to 13.10, while Grafton closed 1c higher on 11.50. Financial shares 
were hit by the ECB comments, with only Anglo Irish Bank able to make any positive headway, up 16c to 14.43. AIB 
was the biggest faller in the sector, down 32c to 20.90, while Bank of Ireland lost 14c to 15.56 and Irish Life and 
Permanent closed 13c lower on 19.21. The news was not all bad, with Ryanair managing modest gains, up 10c to

 (ANSA) - Rimini, November 2 - The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will resume on March 27, 2007 the flights from the 
northern Italian airport of Rimini, Ryanair's marketing manager for Italy, Alessia Viviani, said.
 The first flight of Ryanair from Rimini will be to Nottingham, central England.
The flight will be sold on the Internet for one week, starting from November 2, 2006, at the launch price of 0.01 euro 
($ 0.013), excluding taxes.
 Rimini's airport operator Aeradria SpA has signed a five-year contract with Ryanair, which will launch two more 
flights from the airport in September 2007 and March 2008, Aeradria's chairman, Massimo Masini, said.
 The Rimini-Nottingham flight will be operated three times a week with a 189-seater aircraft. The airline expects to 
transport 40,000 passengers on the route in the first year of operation.
 Compared to Ryanair's average price of 41 euro ($ 52.3) per flight, Italian state-owned air carrier Alitalia charges 
186 euro ($ 237.4), the low-cost company said. Compared to Alitalia's punctuality rate of 79 pct, Ryanair boasts a 
rate of 90 pct.
 Ryanair currently operates 425 routes and targets to transport 52 million passengers by 2008, 64 million by 2010 
and 73 million by 2012.

It is also corporate broker to 75 per cent of the companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The management buy-out is the latest in a shake-out in the Irish broking community, which has seen NCB sold by 
Ulster Bank and Merrion set up as a breakaway from NCB.
Goodbody, owned by Allied Irish Banks, is now the only non-independent Irish stockbroker.
Bank of Ireland had always been reluctant to sell Davy.
It realised, however, that if it did not accede to the broker's demands, it might start to lose key staff.
This has already happened at Bank of Ireland's asset management business, where Perpetual Trustees, an 
Australian financial services group, poached four of the bank's top fund managers.
Davy was founded in the 1920s. Tony Garry, chief executive, is proud of the fact that Davy was Ireland's first 
Catholic brokerage in what had traditionally been a profession dominated by the minority Protestant merchant class 
under British rule. At the time of Big Bang in 1987, Citigroup held a small stake in Davy.
But in 1988 Bank of Ireland bought 90 per cent, with a small group of directors and managers owning the remainder 
while controlling 51 per cent of the voting rights.
Retaining staff key to Euros 317m management buy-out at Davy John Murray Brown examines the latest turn in 
an Irish shake-out
Mr Garry insists that the MBO is not a prelude to selling the business. "We bought it so we can own it, not sell it."
He says there was a "widespread desire for ownership" on the part of ordinary staff. "Broking works better in a 
partnership ethos."
If the deal had been concluded a year ago, when first raised with the Bank of Ireland board, the asking price would 
almost certainly have been lower.
But the sale of rival Merrion to Landsbanki last December, with the Icelandic bank taking an initial 50 per cent stake 
for Euros 27m, raised valuations placed on Irish brokerages.
A few years ago, there was a dearth of new listings. The advent of the euro had seen Irish fund managers selling 
Irish equities in the belief they could better match their assets and liabilities across the bigger euro area economies.
Today the pendulum is swinging back in Dublin's favour, with 55 per cent of trading in Irish shares now handled in 
Dublin.
One reason is that foreign institutions, who now own half the market, like to trade where there is the most liquidity.
Davy made a profit last year of Euros 45m and has clearly been one of the main beneficiaries of these 
developments.
But the real change has been the emergence of Dublin's new rich who, as Mr Garry puts it, "are very aggressive in 
looking for returns on their cash".
Wealth management now accounts for half the firm's profits. Hardly any big property deal involving Irish investors, 
at home or abroad, goes ahead without Davy involvement.
"Ireland never had a history of wealth management because there was no wealth to manage," says Mr Garry, who 
together with Brian Davy and Kyran McLaughlin, is one of the original shareholder directors leading the MBO.
Ireland's new rich are not all native Irish. Davy is looking to hire Chinese-speaking equity salesmen to sell equities 
to Dublin's growingChinese community.

One man who'd never be bound by the sedate rules of Aim is Michael O'Leary.
On a dash through London yesterday to promote Ryanair's latest venture, an online gambling deal with 
Jackpotjoy.com, he insisted he was unable to comment on the airline's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 990m) bid for Aer 
Lingus, as he was not being "chaperoned" by a posse of lawyers and investment bankers. But he managed to give 
a flavour of his thinking. Hadn't Ryanair.com just been declared the most popular website in Ireland by a Google 
survey, he was asked. True, he enthused.
"Ryanair.com was number one ahead of Big Brother at number two, God help us, and a small, pissy airline, Aer 
Lingus, was number three." (The Takeover Panel must be breathing a sigh of relief that this bid doesn't come under 
its jurisdiction.)
O'Leary also tore into the "environmental claptrap" that was being talked about role of aviation emissions in climate 
change. Higher taxes on aviation would not affect Ryanair's growth, he said - "We will continue to grow like 
gangbusters."
It was the price differential to airlines such as British Airways and EasyJet that was driving its expansion, and taxes 
would not change that.
Taxes on motoring had had no effect on people buying their second and third family car and driving when they 
wanted, he said. Road transport accounted for 23 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions, and aviation for only 3 per 
cent.
If you stopped all flying, O'Leary said, any benefit would soon be overwhelmed by all the power stations being 
opened in China.
And anyway, if they were serious about the environment, all the "chattering classes should stop driving their SUVs 
to Sainsbury's at the weekend", he said, before jetting back to Dublin.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's fastest-growing airline, said Wednesday it is launching a new gambling Web site in 
a deal with a leading Internet gaming company, Jackpotjoy.com.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he hoped the deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, would help 
the carrier to boost non-ticket revenue to 20 percent from the current 15 percent.
The deal means visitors to Ryanair's Web site are being offered the chance to make a credit-card deposit to play 
more than 80 online games, including several kinds of bingo, casino and card games. Next year, O'Leary said, 
Ryanair hopes to allow passengers to play Jackpotjoy games on their cell phones during flights once the airline 
installs new telecommunications equipment on its planes that permits in-flight cell phone use.
In September, Ryanair announced a five-year contract with an advertising company, InviseoMedia, to install 
seatback ads on all of its aircraft in another initiative to generate income from passengers during flights.
Dublin-based Ryanair, which was founded in 1985, today has 3,700 employees and operates more than 350 routes 
to 23 countries across Europe. It is currently pursuing a hostile takeover of Irish rival Aer Lingus Group PLC, a 
formerly state-controlled airline that was floated on the Irish and British stock exchanges last month.
Online gambling has been the subject of international controversy since the United States effectively banned it last 
month.
Britain is seeking support from dozens of nations for new regulations on the booming sector, saying that would offer 
gamblers better protection than a ban.
The U.S. Congress caught the gaming industry by surprise when it added a provision to an unrelated bill making it 
illegal for banks and credit card companies to settle payments to online gambling sites. President Bush signed it 
into law Oct. 14.

Shares on the Dublin market rallied late on today to close marginally higher, with CRH and Kingspan leading the 
charge.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 7.64 points higher on 8628.97.
The late surge in Dublin came despite a negative opening on Wall Street after a shock slowdown in US 
manufacturing growth for October tempered initial enthusiasm following strong earnings from MasterCard and an 
upbeat forecast for new private-sector jobs.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index registered 51.2 in October, below September's 
reading of 52.9 and at its lowest level since June 2003. In Dublin, shares in Kingspan were notable higher, climbing 
almost 4pc late on. Shares in the building materials firm have now gained one euro since last Thursday. Davy 
analyst, Florence O'Donoghue, said that the gains could have came from "a last minute auction at the end of the 
day's trading". "This may well resolve itself tomorrow but we'll have to wait and see," he added. CRH was up again 
after brokers earlier this week signalled a likely expansion of highway construction in the US. Shares were up 18c to 
27.87. McInerney and Grafton both slipped in to the red, however, down 6c to 13.20 and 1c to 11.49 respectively. 
Elsewhere, shares in Ryanair were down 5c to 8.80 after the no-frills airline announced that it is to offer bingo on its 
website. The news was outweighed somewhat, however, by reports that its hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus may 
be too small to be judged by EU competition chiefs. A report in the Financial Times on Wednesday said it would be 
a 'significant setback' for Ryanair if the deal were scrutinised by the Irish Competition Authority, rather than the EU. 
Shares in Aer Lingus were up 2c to2.85, after the flag carrier announced several new routes for next summer earlier 
this week. The airline is launching new routes from Cork to Manchester and Madrid and from Dublin to Newcastle, 
Milan-Malpensa and Athens. AIB was a major faller in the banking sector, down 12c to 21.23, while Bank of Ireland 
was down 9c to 15.70 after it confirmed that it had sold its 90.44pc in Davy Stockbrokers to Davy's management for 
E316.44m. Irish Life and Permanent jumped 12c to 9c to 19.34 Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo Irish Bank managed 
Kingpsan drags sluggish ISEQ higher
to buck the trend, tacking on 22c to 14.27 after it announced on Tuesday, the opening of several new offices in the

third-quarter losses widened on lower sales of the antibiotic Maxipime and increased administrative costs. The 
pharmaceutical group said on October 25 that net losses widened to USD117m, or 27 cents a share, from a loss of 
USD67.1m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Since then shares have been out of favour with investors. Other notable 
movers included DCC, up 20c to 21.40, Drinks and snacks group C and C, down 2c to 13.00, and Qualceram 
Shires, up 14c to 1.84. Meanwhile, shares in software firm Norkom shot up by more than 6pc, or 10c, to 1.65, after 
it won a major deal to help one of Austria's largest retail banks fight financial fraud and detect terrorist financing. 
Bawag PSK, which has more than 1.3 million private customers and over 60,000 business customers, will deploy 
Norkom's financial crime and compliance software across its business to detect, investigate, manage and report 
suspicious activity.

Body
No-frills airline Ryanair has dismissed calls for green taxes on aviation, saying aircraft emissions are insignificant 
compared to the pollution caused by emerging economies and cars.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary described recent demands by UK lawmakers and environment campaigners for 
the airline industry to face new taxes to help fight climate change as 'the usual horseshit'.
A report commissioned by the UK Treasury and released earlier this week called for tougher measures to combat 
the effects of global warming.
 The report's author, former World Bank economist Sir Nicholas Stern, said international flights create twice as 
many emissions as domestic journeys and the impact on climate changes goes beyond greenhouse gases. 
Speaking at a news conference to launch a new Ryanair gaming service, O'Leary claimed aviation accounts for 
only 3pc of global greenhouse gas emissions. He said campaigners should instead be focusing on more significant 
sources of pollution, such as tiger economies like China and road transport. 'If people are really serious about 
tackling the minuscule emissions from the aircraft industry, they should be looking at airlines still using old gas-
guzzling aircraft,' he added. O'Leary claimed green taxes on flights would not affect the growth of Ryanair or other 
no-frills airlines because of the price differential between the cost of their flights and those of traditional flag carriers. 
He said Ryanair had no plans to join the European Union's carbon emission trading scheme, which he said he had 
not even heard of. International air travel is not included in the scheme, but the British government is keen to see it 
included, particularly with the rise in low cost carriers. Meanwhile, O'Leary said security at most British airports had 
returned to normal following the disruption caused by the discovery in August of an alleged plot to blow up 
transatlantic flights. However, he said security at Stansted airport near London was still 'a shambles' and accused 
airport operator BAA of not recruiting enough security staff. BAA claimed Ryanair had failed to agree to its request 
to open airline check-in desks earlier to cope with the extra demand, but O'Leary said that would still leave 
passengers waiting.

Highlight: Imagine a Ryanair for Asia and the analogy will help to establish how Tiger Airways is regarded in the 
region. Alex Lennane finds out from Tony Davis, the carrier's chief executive officer, on how the carrier's business 
model ensures a competitive advantage.
Body
Davis: "Tiger will consider all business strategies in its expansion plans to become a Pan-Asian airline"
 You would expect an airline part owned by Ryanair founder Tony Ryan to be both ambitious and cheap - and Tiger 
Airways, the hungry Singapore-based budget carrier, is just that. Expanding quickly, it is taking on rival AirAsia, 
looking to capture new Chinese markets, and sticking hard and fast to its tight, trusty business model. A Ryanair for 
Asia. 
Tony Davis, its chief executive officer, is keen to point out the airline's ambitious growth plans, which will see a 
further eight A320s added to its fleet in the next four years, with the first delivering in 2008. 
The carrier already operates seven A320s, with two more arriving before the end of 2006, and a further three to be 
delivered in 2007. The orders will bring its fleet total to 20 aircraft by 2010, all in a typical low-cost airline single-
class configuration of 180 seats. 
Boeing, it seemed, barely got a look in when it came to fleet selection, based on the carrier's business model, which 
demands low operating costs and fast turn-round times. 
"We chose the A320 because of the aircraft's superb operational cost efficiency and high passenger appeal," says 
Davis. "The aircraft is designed to optimize revenue through cabin adaptability and passenger comfort and features 
the most modern and complete fly-by-wire technology available on any single-aisle aircraft. It ensures savings in 
every element of the direct operating cost and provides us with the highest degree of operational commonality and 
economy for an aircraft." 
He adds that fast turn-rounds are made easier because the aircraft has the widest single-aisle fuselage available. 
"This is essential in the low-cost markets. The cabin size and shape also allow larger overhead stowage to be fitted 
for faster boarding and deplaning," says Davis. 
The rigid business strategy means that the airline will not consider adding different aircraft types to its fleet. "As a 
true low-cost carrier, the airline will operate a single aircraft type fleet to enjoy cost-saving benefits. Single fleet type 
allows savings in crew efficiencies and reduces engineering costs and complexity," says Davis. Tiger Airways has 
Enter the tiger
invested S$110 million ($70.5 million) in a five-year maintenance contract with parent company Singapore Airlines, 
and its maintenance, repair and overhaul work is done by SIA Engineering. 
Financing In keeping with its private status, Tiger is staying tight-lipped about its finances and how it is paying for its 
new orders. But it has weighty backers. 
The carrier is owned by Singapore Airlines (49%), investment firm Indigo Partners (24%), Irelandia Investments 
Limited, the private investment arm of Ryan and his family, (16%), and Temasek Holdings (11%). Davis does 
reveal, however, that the first four aircraft are on lease, and the following eight will be on a sale/leaseback 
arrangement. Lessors include Boullioun, GATX and RBS. 
The new fleet will be deployed to cover the airline's expanding ambitions. The aim is to grow Tiger Airways, which 
has been operating since 2004, "into a pan-Asian low-cost carrier". The network is a simple point-to-point operation, 
says Davis, "to avoid high flight transfer costs, reduce lost and delayed baggage, improve punctuality, and allow 
simple tariffs". 
Flying high Tiger flies to 15 cities in seven countries within a four-hour flight time of Singapore, and is looking to 
increase its network, but Davis says the expansion will be careful, not rushed. 
"Tiger Airways is poised for fast but measured growth with its aircraft delivery schedules timed to achieve 
economies of scale in our operations," he says. Davis remains cagey about possible new markets, pointing out that 
Tiger will go where there is demand for the product. 
But he reveals that the airline and its backers may look into a possible strategic investment in another carrier. "Tiger 
Airways will consider all business strategies in its expansion plans to be a pan-Asian airline," he states, adding: "We 
see tremendous opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region... low fares mean more people can afford to travel and more 
often." 
The low-fare idea is central to the airline. Its model is pure - and is based on similar principals to those of the kings 
of the low-cost carriers, Southwest and Ryanair. The objective, says Davis, is basic: "A simple operation to keep 
costs as low as possible, where savings are passed on to customers through low fares." 
Business model The business model as used by Tiger has all the correct elements. High aircraft utilization, 
operating as many flights as possible on each aircraft with short turns on the ground to reduce unproductive time. 
Fares are set at levels designed to sell as many seats as possible on every flight. The airline believes in high 
investment in marketing costs to establish brand awareness, which will lead to direct sales. And the frills don't come 
for free. 
"We offer consumers choice in relation to additional purchases for food and drink, additional baggage allowance, 
changes to tickets. We eliminate costs, which would otherwise increase fares, such as frequent-flyer programmes," 
says Davis. Tiger has added its own innovations - for example, the ability to add extra baggage for a small fee, an 
idea equivalent to the McDonald's super-size. 
But the airline has had to make accommodations for the Asian market. "The Asian market is more fragmented as 
compared to Europe and there are more regulations. Tiger Airways plans to enter new markets through marketing 
agreements and operational tie-ups with local carriers in these markets." 
The airline has no concerns about lack of internet and credit card penetration in Asia, and its distribution strategy 
again adheres firmly to the low-cost model. 
Tickets are sold mainly through the internet, "which accounts for more than 90% of our sales", says Davis. "We also 
sell seats through our call-centre and any travel agent that is able to access the internet. Credit card acceptance is 
fast growing in the Asia-Pacific region. However, in areas that credit card usage is low, cash is accepted at our call-
centres and at travel agents," he adds. 
Enter the tiger
Tiger does not use a global distribution system, so travel agents can only get tickets by logging on to the website to 
access the internet fares - and, of course, the airline is ticketless. 
"By offering direct sales to our customers using the internet, we reduce distribution costs and avoid ticket 
production costs," says Davis. 
Advantage 
Tiger has one big advantage - the budget terminal at Singapore's Changi Airport. Using cheap airports is part of the 
plan, says Davis. "We utilize secondary or underserved airports with lower operating costs, and limit the services 
purchased from the airport to only those that are essential," he explains. 
But the convenience of a well-located and linked major airport as a hub puts Tiger ahead of the game and, says 
Davis, it would like to see more, similar terminals in Asia. "A specially designed budget terminal will help us to 
improve our cost and operational efficiency," he says, adding: "Since moving to the Changi budget terminal we 
have cut costs and increased efficiency because it was designed specifically for low-cost airline operations." 
It is evidently successful: more than 500,000 Tiger passengers have used the terminal since it became the first 
carrier to launch its operations from there just six months ago. Davis says: "The airline benefits as the utilization 
costs are reduced while operational efficiency increases; passengers benefit on costs savings by enjoying lower 
fares and shorter time spent at the terminal." He explains: "Due to the streamline terminal layout, Tiger Airways 
allows passengers to check in a minimum of 30 minutes before take off at the budget terminal compared to 45 
minutes at terminal one." 
Although Tiger is reluctant to put a figure on the cost cuts achieved, the airline says it makes savings through not 
using aerobridges, through lower handling charges and a more efficient use of resources. 
Tiger Airways is working hard to make sure its future is secure but, this being the airline industry, there are still a 
few hurdles. The region is increasingly busy with competition, although, says Davis, Tiger has nothing to fear if it 
sticks to its pure model and continues to offer low fares. 
The other problem is, of course, fuel costs, which are continuing to rise. "Fuel costs form a significant cost 
component and, like all airlines, we are affected by  the rise and volatility of fuel prices," admits Davis. 
He declines to reveal the airline's hedging strategy but most low-cost carriers hedge a significant proportion of their 
fuel costs. Unlike with some carriers, though, the price hikes are not passed on directly to the passengers. "We do 
not impose a fuel surcharge but try to be even more cost efficient in areas where we can control or reduce costs to 
continue to keep fares low," he says. 
Challenges Other challenges include expansion. Regional government regulations make it harder for the airline to 
open new markets, which, while not preventing Tiger from its ambition to be a pan-Asian airline, is making it a little 
more complicated. 
"One of the challenges we'll be facing over the coming year is to develop more routes for our expanding fleet," says 
Davis. "Setting up overseas operations, such as the marketing tie-up with SEAIR of the Philippines, will assist to 
develop new areas of growth." 
The airline will not discuss financial projections, investment plans or financial results, but it expects to see its two 
millionth passenger before the end of this year, and hopes to find more ways of increasing margins in 2007. 
"We are vigilant all the time in looking for ways to reduce costs to keep fares low but without compromising safety 
and security," he says. The carrier credits its success so far to its "ability to deliver consistently low fares over the 
long term" - and claims to be Singapore's only real low-cost carrier because it offers low fares all-year round. 
The focus on fares never stops - again echoing Ryanair's mantra. There is no talk of customer service, or 
passenger preference - the belief at Tiger is that the passenger will always be happy if the fare is low enough. 
Enter the tiger
The carrier's aim for next year is to be able "to offer customers even lower fares to more destinations around the 
Asia-Pacific region". This low fare game has certainly made Ryanair rich, but some industry observers in Europe 
wonder whether the tide is turning and whether passengers would prefer to pay a little extra for a few certainties 
and comforts. 
Climate change could also spell trouble for the budget airlines. But in the near future, for Tiger Airways at least, 
cheap is definitely looking cheerful.

Ryanair seeks Brussels go-ahead on Aer Lingus bid TRAVEL & LEISURE

Ryanair has notified the European competition authorities of its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus, its smaller Irish 
rival, but there were growing doubts last night about whether the size of the deal was big enough to place it within 
Brussels' jurisdiction.
It would be a significant setback for Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, if it fails to have the deal scrutinised 
by Brussels and instead has to face an examination by the Irish Competition Authority.
There is also the possibility that UK Office of Fair Trading and competition authorities in some other European 
member states might scrutinise the proposed takeover.
The Irish government, which still owns a stake of 25.35 per cent in Aer Lingus, has expressed fierce opposition to 
Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 990m) bid for the former state-owned carrier.
Martin Cullen, Irish transport minister, has claimed that Ryanair is trying to "recreate a monopoly in the aviation 
sector in this country. A monopoly is bad for business, bad for this country, bad for the customer, bad for the 
travelling public and it's bad for tourism interests in this country."
To come under the jurisdiction of Brussels the deal has to satisfy a series of key conditions, namely that:*the 
combined worldwide turnover of the two groups is greater than Euros 2.5bn*the combined turnover exceeds Euros 
100m in at least three European Union member states, and that*each company has a turnover of more than Euros 
25m in those three member states.
It is understood that the proposed takeover meets the first two conditions but possibly fails narrowly on the third, 
depending on how the precise rules on the origination of traffic at either end of routes is interpreted.
It is believed that figures provided by Aer Lingus to Brussels suggest that it has turnover of more than Euros 25m in 
only two member states, Ireland and the UK.
In public Ryanair has expressed confidence that it will be able to overcome any competition objections. Brussels 
has shown itself favourable to consolidation in the European airline industry because it is too fragmented.

Ryanair has asked European competition watchdogs to rule on its bid for Aer Lingus, but concerns are growing that 
the size of deal may not be big enough for Brussels to get involved, the Financial Times reported.
If the no-frills airline fails to have Europe scrutinise the deal, it will instead face an examination by the Irish 
Competition Commission, which the paper claimed would be a significant set back for Ryanair.
The Irish government, which owns a stake of 25.35 pct in Aer Lingus, has expressed fierce opposition to the E1.5bn 
bid for the former state-owned airline.
 To come under the jurisdiction of Brussels the merger must lead to combined worldwide turnover greater than 2.5 
bln eur and combined turnover of more than E100m in at least three European Union member states, while each 
company must have a turnover of more than E25m in those three member states. The proposed deal may narrowly 
fail on the latter condition, the FT said.

Ryanair's request that the European Commission look at its planned takeover of Aer Lingus does not guarantee an 
EU review of the deal, the Commission said today.
Ryanair notified the E1.48 billion deal to the Commission yesterday.
'The fact that Ryanair has notified the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus to the Commission is without prejudice as to 
whether or not it actually falls within the scope of the merger regulation,' Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd 
said.
It is up to companies involved to calculate whether a planned deal falls within the jurisdiction of the Commission and 
then to notify it. If companies make a mistake in their calculations, the Commission can send the deal back to 
national authorities for review. Ryanair shares closed up three cent at E8.85 in Dublin this evening.

EU regulators must still check if Irish low-fare airline Ryanair's bid for rival Aer Lingus falls within its responsibility, 
an EU spokesman said Tuesday.
The European Commission usually decides on mergers where both companies have more than €250 million 
(US$316 million) in sales in Europe, but a national antitrust regulator can take charge if the businesses have two-
thirds of their sales in one country.
EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said it was up to Ryanair to decide if EU or national regulators would be responsible 
for the deal, and the EU would then have to evaluate if that was justified.
"As with any other case notified to it, the Commission will now verify and check whether it agrees that this ... has a 
European dimension," he said.
Irish low-fare airline Ryanair Holdings PLC asked the Commission on Monday to approve its €1.48 billion (US$1.9 
billion) hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
The Commission set a provisional deadline of Dec. 6 to clear the deal but can extend that if it identifies antitrust 
problems or receives complaints from rivals.
The deal is likely to face careful scrutiny from regulators because the two control over 70 percent of the Irish short-
haul market.
Ryanair says it competes directly against Aer Lingus on 17 out of 500 routes but analysts say that number is higher 
if cities, rather than airports, are used to define routes. Ryanair usually flies to smaller airports farther away from the 
city destination, using a shuttle bus to connect the two.
If the tie-up goes ahead, the airlines may be forced to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Dublin hub. 
Regulators demanded that Air France SA and the Netherlands' KLM make give up slots at their home airports of 
Paris and Amsterdam when they merged in 2004. Lufthansa AG and Swiss also had to make similar concessions 
last year.

Rise in air travel puts CO2 targets out of reach EMISSIONS

Body
The spotlight fell on the aviation industry yesterday since, while it is still a relatively small source of carbon 
emissions, it is one of the fastest growing. Given its dependence on jet fuel, it has little room for manoeuvre.
Aviation represents 2.6 per cent of CO emissions in the European Union but some fear that, in 40-50 years' time, 
the industry will demand almost all of the emission allowances for the European economy.
Airlines in Europe believe they have unjustifiably become the target for the environmental lobby in the climate 
change debate. In Europe, international aviation emissions were 114m tonnes in 2004, while road transport and 
residentialCO emissions were 10 times that size and have risen by 175m tonnes since 1990.
The growth in the budget airline sectorhas strengthened the call for measures to curb the expansion of aviation, led 
by demands for higher taxation.
Globally, capacity in the scheduled airline industry grew by 18.4 per cent from 2000 to 2006, but the capacity of the 
low-cost sector more than doubled, albeit from a small base.
By 2006 it was 12.9 per cent of global capacity but it accounted for 47 per cent of the increase in capacity between 
2000 and 2006.
The airline industry in Europe argues against the use of taxation to cut emissions, but with some exceptions - most 
notably Ryanair - it has begun to accept that aviation should be included in some form of emissions trading scheme. 
A study for the European Commission said ticket prices in Europe would rise by up to Euros 9 (Pounds 4.70) for a 
return flight from such a move.
Improvements in technology, operations and infrastructure could all help to curb emissions, but are likely to be 
outstripped by growth in air travel.
Taxation would raise revenues for governments, but may have little impact on demand. The fuel surcharges on 
long-haul flights, introduced by airlines in response to the oil price rises of the past two years, have done little to 
dampen demand.
Rise in air travel puts CO2 targets out of reach EMISSIONS
The inclusion of aviation in emissions trading schemes does not meet the demands of environmental groups, 
however, who are fighting climate change, noise, local air quality and airport expansion.
In the UK, passenger numbers are forecast to more than double, from 200m in 2003 to 470m in 2030. A study by 
the University of Oxford found the amount of carbon dioxide from aviation would be four to 10 times above 1990 
levels by 2050.
This increase would, in effect, outweigh the reductions in emissions made by most other sectors of the economy 
combined. The study found the increase would "make official government targets to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions by 60 per cent by 2050 almost impossible to achieve".

Ryanair is reported to have asked the European Commission for permission to buy Aer Lingus.
The move, which was confirmed last night on the Commission's website, ends doubts about whether the proposed 
takeover would be reviewed by regulators in Brussels or in Dublin.
The no-frills airline launched a hostile bid for the former state-owned airline earlier this month.
 The EU must decide by December 6 whether to approve the deal or extend the consideration date. Michael 
O'Leary has offered E1.48m for Aer Lingus, with Ryanair already owning 19.2pc of the airline. The Government and 
Aer Lingus's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) are both against the takeover. The Government has said 
that any competition review of the proposed takeover must look at the impact on Irish aviation, as well as the 
European market as a whole. It is concerned that any merger would effectively create an Irish airline monopoly. 
Ryanair believes the proposed deal should be judged by its effect across the European Union.

Ryanair formally issued its Euros 2.80 a share offer document: "We may have won the battle, but we haven't won 
the war."
Aer Lingus is set to take the full 14 days allowed under stock exchange rules before publishing its defence 
document, now expected on Monday week.
Aer Lingus said it would deal with "numerous misrepresentations by Ryanair" in its response to Ryanair's 
conditional offer.
The company on Thursday issued a statement rebutting Ryanair claims that members of the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust, which owns a 12.58 per cent stake, would each receive Euros 60,000 tax free if they accepted 
Ryanair's offer.
Aer Lingus said Ryanair's calculation assumed there were just 3,200 trust beneficiaries when, in fact, there were 
4,665, with the result that the Ryanair offer was actually worth Euros 32,500, or little more than half what Michael 
O'Leary claimed.
The Ryanair boss last week for the first time conceded that the success of its bid would probably depend on 
winning the backing of the Esot, given opposition to the bid from the government, which retains 28per cent, Denis 
O'Brien, the telecommunications entrepreneur, who has 2.1 per cent, and pilots bodies, which have more than 4 per 
cent.
UK AND IRELAND : Aer Lingus chief pledges to thwart Ryanair 's hostile bid TRAVEL & LEISURE
Potentially damagingto Aer Lingus's case, however, was this week'sIrish media reports, denied by union officials, 
that Mr Mannion told Wednesday's meeting that there would have to be job cuts to reduce costs in the face of 
thecompetitive threat from Ryanair.
Preserving jobs has been the main argument deployed by union bosses in urging Esot members to reject the 
Ryanair offer.
Last week, Mr O'Leary indicated job cuts were likely in areas such as catering and marketing rather than among 
pilots and cabin crew.
He said: "There will be job losses but it won't be half of the 3,500 people - I'd be surprised if it was a third of the 
3,500 people."
But he also predictedif Ryanair's bid succeeded "there will be more people in Aer Lingus in three years' time".

The Aer Lingus takeover battle intensified yesterday as Ryanair and its smaller Irish rival traded blows over how Aer 
Lingus employees might benefit personally from the Ryanair offer.
In a statement to the Irish and London stock exchanges released this morning, Aer Lingus accused Ryanair of 
"serious inaccuracies and misrepresentations".
In its offer document, which was posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Monday, Ryanair said that its Euros 2.80-a-
share bid "equates to an average of over Euros 60,000 (Pounds 40,300) per employee with a tax-free option for 
Esot (employee share ownership trust) members".
The trust's votes are likely to play a key role in the outcome of the bid battle as it now controls a stake of 12.58 per 
cent in Aer Lingus.
It is yet to express publicly an opinion on the bid but if, as expected, it joins the Irish government, which holds a 
25.35 per cent stake, and several smaller investor groupings, which have already firmly rejected the bid, Ryanair 
faces an uphill struggle to achieve its target of winning a stake of at least 50.1 per cent, unless it chooses to raise 
its offer significantly.
The trust has around 4,665 members, of which some 1,200 no longer work for Aer Lingus.
In its statement, Aer Lingus said that, after taking account of the trust's borrowing costs of about Euros 35m, the 
Ryanair offer was only worth an average of about Euros 32,000 per trust member, little more than half the total 
claimed by Ryanair.
It also said that the "purported tax-free status" of the option offered by Ryanair was "highly conditional".
The employee share ownership trust said last night that it had informed the Irish Takeover Panel that current 
employee members of the trust would realise Euros 38,864 on average, if the Ryanair bid was accepted, while 
former employees would receive Euros 13,915 on average.

Ryanair yesterday sought to make capital from reports that Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, had 
warned employees that the airline faced the needto make significant cost savings and job cuts regardless of the

Takeover target Aer Lingus kept up its fight against Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday, claiming its suitor had 
seriously misrepresented its position in a statement designed to bolster its bid.
Ryanair, which earlier this month launched a €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) bid for fellow Irish carrier Aer Lingus 
Group PLC, said in a statement Thursday that Aer Lingus staff shareholders should accept its offer, based on the 
money they would receive and reports of possible job cuts.
Ryanair claimed that staff members of Aer Lingus' Employee Share Ownership Trust, which has a 12.6 percent 
stake in the airline, could expect to get €60,000 (US$76,300) each by selling their shares in the airline.
Aer Lingus said the statement was "incorrect and seriously misleading," and that its own calculations showed that 
trust members would receive around €32,500 (US$41,300) each if they accepted the offer.
Gaining the support of the trust could be the key to winning control of Aer Lingus after the government said it would 
not sell its 25.35 percent stake. A number of smaller Aer Lingus shareholders are also opposed to the bid.

Body
Aer Lingus today said Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus is worth just over half of the amount Ryanair has claimed that 
ESOT members could receive.
Aer Lingus said the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) has approximately 4,665 members and, after 
allowing for the trust's borrowings, the offer is worth an average of approximately E32,500 per ESOT member, an 
inaccuracy which has been drawn to Ryanair's attention.
Yesterday, Ryanair urged Aer Lingus employees to accept its offer of E2.80 per share which it said, "will result in 
Aer Lingus employees realising over E220m for their shares in the airline... an average of over E60,000 per 
employee, with a tax free option for ESOT members".
 Today's response from Aer Lingus said: "This purported tax-free status is highly conditional, dependent on 
Revenue approval and, extraordinarily, dependent on Aer Lingus employees and former employees going into the 
public markets and buying shares in Ryanair, a company whose stock has under-performed other European airlines 
during 2006." "The numerous misrepresentations by Ryanair will be dealt with in full when Aer Lingus issues its 
response to Ryanair's conditional offer."

Shares in Independent News and Media rose in line with the wider Dublin market this morning after it made a 
E2.9bn bid for Australian media group APN in which it has a 40pc stake.
At midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 25.92 points to 8565.61.
Independent, which already owns a 40pc stake in the company, made the approach in conjunction with private 
equity group Providence. Shares in the company were up 4c to 2.60.
 It is understood that the funding of a buy-out with bank debt would enable Independent to take some E362-E420 
million in cash from APN while indirectly holding onto its 40pc interest in the business. While a return of cash to 
shareholders is also a possibility, it is more likely that such funds would be used to help Independent to finance its 
international expansion. Elsewhere on the market, the financials performed strongly with the exception of Bank of 
Ireland, which slipped 6c to 15.44. The news was better elsewhere in the sector however, with AIB up 8c to 21.23, 
Anglo Irish Bank up 7c to 13.96 and Irish Life and Permanent up 18c to 19.35. Kingspan suffered heavy falls after it 
was confirmed that the Competition Authority has rejected its takeover bid for Ireland and UK-based firm Xtratherm. 
Shares were down 25c to 16.30. CRH was also in the red, slipping 8c to 27.25, while McInerney was unchanged on 
13.45. Grafton managed to buck the trend, tacking on 5c to 11.50. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 1c to 2.85 despite 
reports overnight that it is about to cut staff in a bid to fight the Ryanair threat. Airline Chief Executive, Dermot 
Mannion said there would have to be job cuts if they are to compete with Michael O'Leary's airline. Shares in 
Ryanair were down 1c to 8.85. Elsewhere, Elan bounced back in fine style after it announced worse than expected 
third quarter results yesterday. Shares were up 25c to 12.25 today. IAWS made steady headway, up 40c to 17.65, 
after it announced it is planning to set up a new a new operating company, Origin Enterprises, to focus on its 
original core agri and non-lifestyle foods businesses.

Independent News and Media led the Dublin market modestly higher today after it made a E2.9bn bid for Australian 
media group APN in which it has a 40pc stake.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 35.39 points higher on 8575.08.
Investors in Dublin shrugged off a sluggish start in the US, where mixed economic news outweighed the decision by

today. CPL Resources was hit by profit taking after it announced on Wednesday that earnings for the half-year to 
the end of December are likely to beat expectations. Chairman John Hennessy told a meeting of shareholders that 
trading has been strong across most sectors of the group's business during the period, reflecting continued growth 
in the Irish economy and labour market. Shares in Ryanair fell 6c to 8.80 after it urged Aer Lingus employees to 
accept its offer of 2.80 euro per share. The no-frills airline said that by doing so they would be realising over 220m 
euro for their shares in the airline, which it said equates to an average of over 60,000 euro per employee, with a tax

Shares in Aer Lingus were up 1c to 2.85. Elsewhere, FBD Holdings made impressive headway tacking on 90c to 
39.90, while DCC jumped 32c to 20.85. South Wharf succumbed to profit taking after recent gains, falling 30c to

Irish males aged between 21 and 30 outstrip their female counterparts by 38pc for online spending, according to

3V Vouchers is a service, which allows customers access to online shopping via prepaid VISA numbers.
Customers can buy vouchers from Payzone shops nationwide in the same way that they currently purchase credit 
for their mobile phones.
 3V Vouchers are designed to enable customers to purchase goods and services over the Internet without using a 
credit or debit card or needing to have a bank account. With over 60,000 customers in Ireland research shows that 
men are by far the more active online shoppers with 69pc of 3V's customers falling into the male bracket between 
the ages of 21 and 30. Dublin accounts for 33pc of all 3V customers, the firm said, with cities Cork and Galway 
second and third respectively for the highest percentage of customers, 3V said. Kieron Guilfoyle, CEO of 3V 
Transaction Services, said, "today's research and our performance in our first twelve months demonstrates the 
significant demand for an alternative to the traditional credit card. The fact that 33pc of our customer base also have 
a credit card, highlights that savvy Irish consumers view the 3V Voucher as the most secure option for online 
shopping in terms of data protection and controlled spending." The most popular websites for purchases attract 
50pc of all 3V customers, with the remaining 50pc spread across 13,000 websites, 3v said. The top ten sites range 
from travel sites such as Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann, music and entertainment sites such as Play.com, 
Ticketmaster and I-Tunes and the not to be forgotten essentials such as Motor Tax Online.

Ryanair has been named as the most unpopular airline in the world, according to a poll in the UK's Guardian 
newspaper.
In the survey of 4,000 travellers worldwide by travel website TripAdvisor, unfriendly staff, delays and little leg-room 
were the biggest reasons the low-cost carrier Ryanair was named the world's least liked airline.
Heathrow is constructing a new terminal, its fifth, that will increase its capacity from 45 million passengers a year to 
around 75 million - the hub currently handles about 68 million passengers every year, which may improve the 
airport's image in future surveys.
 It was wracked by delays after some 25 suspected terror plotters were arrested and flights were held back over a 
suspected plot to blow up US-bound passenger jets in August. Meanwhile, Singapore's Changi international airport 
was voted the world's favourite, while terrorism was the biggest concern for travellers, followed by natural disasters

Recruitment group CPL Resources led the Dublin market modestly higher this morning after it announced that 
earnings for the half-year to the end of December are likely to beat expectations.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 28.84 points to 8564.87.

With its undulating roof and luminous halls, Terminal 4 at Barajas airport heralded a new age of airport design when 
it opened in February. The vast Madrid airport terminal, with 67 stands, also ushered in an era of intense 
competition for the Spanish skies.
Low-cost carriers swooped on the extra capacity and now they are drawing up the battle lines in Spain, which is on 
track to receive 58m foreign visitors this year.
"With Terminal 4, the government made a crucial bet that Madrid would become the hub of European air traffic," 
says Antonio Lopez de Avila, tourism specialist at Instituto de Empresa business school inMadrid. "There is 
significant room for growth in the Spanish low-cost market."
Spain is already the second biggest destination for low-cost flights originating in Europe, after the UK, according to 
the Institute of Tourism Studies. More than 15m people flew to Spain last year on low-cost airlines, 30 per cent 
more than in 2004.
The additional capacity at Barajas means that airlines can turn around their planes faster and increase utilisation of 
their fleet.
Ryanair is to open its second base in Spain, at Barajas airport, in November, with an investment of Dollars 210m. It 
aims to add 1m passengers per year with three new aircraft on 14 new routes. The airline also plans to add 17 
routes to its operations in Girona airport, near Barcelona, in March.
EasyJet plans to open its first Spanish operating base at Barajas in February and begin flying Spanish domestic 
routes.
Vueling, a Spanish low-cost operator launched two years ago, will increase its daily flights between Madrid and 
Barcelona to five from two this month and open three new routes. Vueling is 40 per cent owned by private equity 
Gimmicks and innovation mark budget carriers' battle for skies AIRLINES: The government and airlines are 
betting on big passenger growth, says Victoria Burnett
group Apax Partners, 30 per cent by Inversiones Hemisferio, a subsidiary of Spanish media group Grupo Planeta, 
and 23 per cent by the management. Dave Barger, JetBlue president, leads a group of investors with a 7 per cent 
stake.
In the face of rising low-cost competition and the threat of a growing high-speed rail network, Iberia, the national 
flag-carrier, has begun retreating from domestic routes and spawned a low-cost line, Clickair, which began flying in 
October.
Iberia has a 20 per cent stake in Clickair and the option to raise that to 80 per cent after three years.
"The Clickair strategy is purely defensive. It arose out of Iberia's total failure (to compete with low-cost airlines)," 
says Josep Fransesc Valls, professor of marketing at the Esade business school in Barcelona.
Barcelona-based Clickair, established with Euros 120m in startup capital, began flying seven routes with three 
Airbus A320 aircraft on October 1. It hopes to increase its fleet to 30 aircraft and fly 70 routes by the end of 2008. It 
has as shareholders - each with20 per cent - Nefinsa, owner of Air Nostrum, a franchise of Iberia; Iberostar, a 
tourism group; Cobra, an affiliate of Spanish building company ACS; and Quercus Equity, a Spanish venture capital 
fund. From their spare offices in the same building in the Mas Blau industrial park outside Barcelona, Vueling and 
Clickair have set their sights on the same segment of the market: business travellers from small and medium-sized 
companies prepared to pay a little extra for greater convenience.
Vueling, which passed the 5m-customers mark this month, gets about 25-40 per cent of passengers from this 
segment and wants to build on this. Carlos Munoz, chief executive, says the key to this market is competitive 
service. Vueling flies its lemon-and-grey aircraft only to primary airports, guarantees no overbooking, assigns seats 
and says it beats industry averages for lost luggage and delays.
To this it adds cute gimmicks, such as an onboard string quartet on occasional flights and naming aircraft after 
passengers.
Vueling plans an aggressive targeting of the Barcelona-Madrid route, currently dominated by Iberia's shuttle 
service, which flies every 15 minutes between the cities. It aims to fly 400,000 passengers between the cities next 
year, against 130,000 this year. Iberia flew 2.7m passengers between the cities last year and Spanair, a subsidiary 
of SAS Scandinavian Airlines, more than 1m.
"We're strong now in Barcelona and Madrid and we're going to increase our frequencies. That's what our customers 
want," says Mr Munoz.
Clickair, a self-styled "third-generation" low-cost airline, offers passengers a basic ticket with the option of adding 
services for a fee. Customers can pay extra to buy tickets through a travel agent, rather than online, and change 
travel dates. "The big theme on third generation is build your own," said Alex Cruz, the airline's director-general and 
former European director of commercial aviation at Accenture. "I would gladly pay five quid (extra) to board among 
the first 10-15 people."
Mr Cruz says he is trying to reverse the relationship between the airline and its suppliers, negotiating with caterers 
to pay Clickair a commission for onboard sales. He declined to offer details of such deals.
Clickair and Iberia are at pains to stress their mutual independence, despite Clickair operating some Iberia routes, 
and the airline also having maintenance and baggage handling deals with Iberia and an agreement to sell Iberia 
frequent flyer miles to Clickair passengers.
But the close relationship has raised eyebrows in the industry and some analysts and competitors question the 
prospects of a low cost linked to an incumbent - a model that has failed elsewhere.
"People say: If it looks like Iberia, if it smells like Iberia, if it tastes like Iberia, it must be Iberia," Mr Cruz says. 
"Giveme a few weeksoperating and then come taste me."
Gimmicks and innovation mark budget carriers' battle for skies AIRLINES: The government and airlines are 
betting on big passenger growth, says Victoria Burnett
Meanwhile, Iberia is focusing on Madrid's growing role as a European hub and its ability to connect its long-haul 
customers to domestic routes and, eventually, the high-speed train network. Traffic on its domestic flights fell 5 per 
cent in the first nine months of the year, while traffic on medium and long-haul flights grew 6 per cent and 9 per cent 
respectively. Overall traffic rose 0.2 per cent.
"We have a long-haul market niche that we dominate: Europe toLatin America. Madridhas many advantages (that 
will ensure) it remainsthe gateway to Latin America," says Enrique Depuy, Iberia's director of finance.

Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus is now virtually impossible as opponents amass close to 50pc of Aer 
Lingus' equity.
An alliance of pilots, pilot pensioners, Denis O'Brien, the Government, individual staff shareholders and the 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot) are now effectively blocking the bid.
The group has about 46 per cent of the shares.
 Yesterday a group of pilots, called Tailwind Nominees, confirmed to the stock exchange that they had purchased 
6.1 million shares at E2.90 a share. They now claim to have a 1.6 per cent stake. The Aer Lingus shareholders' 
register indicates that a significant portion of the remaining shares are held by retail investors, many of them buying 
as part of a family investment. If a portion of these and possibly one or two institutions fail to accept the Ryanair bid, 
it would only have a remote chance of success.

The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) plans to spend E450 million on the existing airport terminal where Ryanair will 
be based in future.
Despite concerted opposition to most of its proposals from Ryanair, the DAA has committed to expenditure of E450 
million on Terminal 1, which is currently used by all passengers, the Irish Times reported.
Aer Lingus will move to the new Terminal 2 building. A planning decision on this building is expected today from 
Fingal County Council. Approval may be granted, but it could come with conditions.
 Declan Collier, the chief executive of the DAA, said that a range of projects were being planned for Terminal 1, in 
addition to the construction of Terminal 2. These included a basement area for additional check-in desks, Pier D, 
apron works, a Pier A extension, retail upgrades and a reconfigured check-in and security area. The most 
significant item will be Pier D, which will cost E120 million.

The potential opposition to Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus strengthened yesterday as a pilots group said it had spent 
Euros 17.8m (Pounds 11.9m) to increase its stake.
The Tailwind Participation Trust, which is allied to the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, said it had bought 6.1m 
shares at Euros 2.90 a share, taking its holding to 1.7 per cent.
Analysts said that groups likely to oppose Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn bid now controlled about 46.5 per cent of Aer 
Lingus.
Ryanair, which wants to buy at least 50.1 per cent, so far holds 19.16 percent.
The Irish government, which is opposed to Ryanair's bid, holds 25.35 per cent while the Aer Lingus employee share 
ownership trust owns 12.58 per cent.
In addition, an Aer Lingus pilots fund, Irish Airline Pilots Pensions, now has 2.27 per cent.
Aer Lingus employeesare believed to hold about 2.4 per cent and a 2.1 per cent stake has been built up by Denis 
O'Brien, the Irish entrepreneur opposed to Ryanair's bid.

The Aer Lingus employee share ownership trust (Esot), which is expected to play a key role in the outcome of 
Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn bid for the smaller Irish airline, yesterday increased its stake by exercising options to buy 
more shares from the Irish government.
The trust said it had bought an additional 15.5m shares at Euros 2.20 a share, the price at which the Aer Lingus 
initial public offering was launched at the end of September. The Aer Lingus share price closed 1 per cent lower at 
Euros 2.83.
Ryanair's takeover bid, posted yesterday to Aer Lingus shareholders, was at Euros 2.80 a share, a 27 per cent 
premium to the IPO price.
The employee trust, which has not yet made an official response to the offer, said it had increased its stake from 
9.65 to 12.58 per cent, financing the purchase througha commercial bank loan.
This reduced the Irish government's stake from 28.3 to 25.4 per cent. The government has rejected Ryan-air's bid 
and accused it of seeking to create a monopoly.
Expected opposition to the bid has been strengthened by last week's purchase of a 2.1 per cent stake by Denis 
O'Brien, the Irish telecommunications entrepreneur, and the Irish Airline Pilots Pensions fund, increasing its stake to 
2.27 per cent.
John Sharman, chairman of Aer Lingus said yesterday that a takeover by Ryanair "would be bad for Aer Lingus", its 
shareholders, employees and consumers.A combination would also face "significant regulatory issues", he said.
The Aer Lingus board had decided that two of its members, Francis Hackett and Michael Johns, appointed by the 
transport minister and by the Esot respectively, should not take part in consideration of the offer.

Ryanair's bid to take a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus had another setback as pilots' group, Tailwinds, bought 
a 1.2pc stake in the recently floated airline for E18m.
Opponents of the E1.4 billion Ryanair bid now have more than 46 per cent of the shares, making it difficult for 
Ryanair to get over 50 per cent, unless the Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot) decides to back the bid. 
Ryanair has 19.2 per cent.
It is understood that 6.2 million shares were bought at E2.90 yesterday in a transaction handled by Merrion 
Stockbrokers, which declined to comment last night. A stock exchange disclosure is expected today.
 Tailwinds Nominees is a loose association of pilots interested in having a strong position in the airline. It was 
incorporated in late August, shortly before the Aer Lingus flotation took place. It is understood that this group had 
started selling its shares following the flotation, but this was halted when the Ryanair bid was announced.

 The directors concerned are Francis Hackett and Michael Johns. Mr Johns was appointed in August 2006 and is a

Ryanair delivers takeover plan to Aer Lingus shareholders

Body
Budget airline Ryanair disclosed details of its hostile takeover plan for Irish rival Aer Lingus on Monday and told the 
carrier's shareholders they stood to lose money if they didn't accept the offer.
Ryanair Holdings PLC had unveiled its offer of 2.80 euros ($3.52) per share for Aer Lingus Group PLC on Oct. 5, 
just one week after the Irish government sold its majority stake in the carrier in an IPO that valued Aer Lingus 27 
percent below that price.
On Monday, Ryanair distributed its 125-page offer document to Aer Lingus shareholders and told them they should 
accept or decline the offer by Nov. 13.
In the document, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary noted that his company's aggressive bidding for Aer 
Lingus from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5 rapidly drove up the value of its shares. "If the offer is not accepted, there is a 
likelihood that the share price of Aer Lingus will fall significantly," O'Leary wrote.
He listed a range of potential benefits from a takeover by Ryanair, which last year carried 42.5 million passengers 
compared to Aer Lingus' 8 million. He noted that Ryanair had superior "purchasing power," including its latest deal 
announced last month for 32 new aircraft from Boeing Co. four more than Aer Lingus' entire existing short-haul 
fleet.
Rejecting the offer, he said, would leave Aer Lingus "as a small regional airline in a competitive market with a high 
fare structure and an uncompetitive cost base."
But the chairman of Aer Lingus, John Sharman, reiterated his company's rejection of Ryanair's approach and said 
Aer Lingus would publish a formal rebuttal within 14 days.
"A takeover by Ryanair, no matter how it is dressed up, would be bad for Aer Lingus, for its shareholders, for its 
employees and for consumers," Sharman said.
Aer Lingus shares fell 2 euro cents (2 U.S. cents) to €2.84 (US$3.57) on the Irish Stock Exchange, while shares in 
Ryanair rose 11 euro cents (13 U.S. cents) to €8.82 (US$11.07).
Ryanair delivers takeover plan to Aer Lingus shareholders
The document detailed Ryanair's buildup of more than 100 million Aer Lingus shares, or 19.2 percent of the total, 
before their shock announcement to the British and Irish stock exchanges.
Ryanair since has been legally barred from buying more Aer Lingus shares because they have remained above 
Ryanair's offer price. Many analysts and investors expect Ryanair to raise its offer to secure more than 50 percent 
of shares.
Ranged against Ryanair's bid is the government, which has retained a 25.1 percent stake; an Aer Lingus pilots 
pension fund that holds about 2.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien, who bought 2.1 percent of 
shares this month with the stated aim of thwarting O'Leary's gambit.
Transport Minister Martin Cullen defended the Irish government's handling of the IPO.
"There's no future in state-owned airlines," Cullen said. "That (bid) has happened, but once you go to the market, 
that is what occurs."
Cullen said the government remained confident that most shareholders would reject Ryanair's offer. He said ceding 
control of Aer Lingus to Ryanair would leave Ireland with only "one model" of airline. "We need a diversity of models 
in the market," he said.
The swing vote is probably held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust, which owns more than 11 percent of Aer 
Lingus shares on behalf of 4,700 current and former employees.
O'Leary is wooing the trust's directors and members by offering them a tax-free way to cash in their Aer Lingus 
shares by using the profits to buy and hold Ryanair shares for at least three years.
The ESOT directors have not declared their position on the bid. But in a widely expected move, the directors 
confirmed Monday they had purchased more than 15.5 million shares, or nearly 3 percent of the company, from the 
government at the original IPO price. That took ESOT's share of ownership to nearly 12.6 percent.
As part of winning labor union support for its privatization plan, the government pledged to give ESOT an option to 
buy up to 3 percent of its shares in subsequent years at the original IPO price. Analysts said ESOT snapped up 
their maximum allotment quickly to strengthen its negotiating leverage with Ryanair, which has publicly insisted it 
will not raise its offer.

Ryanair delivers formal takeover plan to Aer Lingus shareholders

Budget airline Ryanair published its hostile takeover plans for Irish rival Aer Lingus on Monday and warned the 
carrier's shareholders they stood to lose money if they didn't accept the offer.
Ryanair Holdings PLC had unveiled its €2.80 (US$3.52) a share offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC on Oct. 5, just one 
week after the Irish government sold its majority stake in the carrier in an IPO that valued Aer Lingus 27 percent 
below that price. On Monday, Ryanair distributed its 125-page offer document to Aer Lingus shareholders and told 
them they should accept or decline the offer by Nov. 13.
In the document, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary noted that his company's aggressive bidding for Aer 
Lingus shares from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5 rapidly drove up the value of Aer Lingus shares. "If the offer is not accepted, 
there is a likelihood that the share price of Aer Lingus will fall significantly," O'Leary wrote.
He listed a range of potential benefits from a takeover by Ryanair, which last year carried 42.5 million passengers 
compared to Aer Lingus' 8 million. He noted that Ryanair had superior "purchasing power," including its latest deal 
announced last month for 32 new aircraft from Boeing Co. four more than Aer Lingus' entire existing short-haul 
fleet.
Rejecting the offer, he said, would leave Aer Lingus "as a small regional airline in a competitive market with a high 
fare structure and an uncompetitive cost base."
But the chairman of Aer Lingus, John Sharman, reiterated his company's rejection of the Ryanair approach and 
said Aer Lingus would publish a formal rebuttal within 14 days.
"A takeover by Ryanair, no matter how it is dressed up, would be bad for Aer Lingus, for its shareholders, for its 
employees and for consumers," Sharman said.
Aer Lingus shares fell 3 euro cents (4 U.S. cents) to close at €2.83 (US$3.55) on the Irish Stock Exchange, while 
shares in Ryanair rose 11 euro cents (14 U.S. cents) to €8.82 (US$11.07).
Ryanair delivers formal takeover plan to Aer Lingus shareholders
The document detailed Ryanair's buildup of more than 100 million Aer Lingus shares, or 19.2 percent of the total, 
before their shock announcement to the British and Irish stock exchanges.
It bought more than 43 million shares on Sept. 27 the IPO date at an average price of €2.37 (US$2.98); 25 million 
more the next day at an average €2.45 (US$3.08); 8 million on Sept. 29 at €2.47 (US$3.10); nearly 8 million more 
on Oct. 4 at €2.49 (US$3.13); and 16.5 million on the day its takeover plans became public at €2.79 (US$3.51).
Ryanair since has been legally barred from buying more Aer Lingus shares because they have remained above the 
€2.80 offer price. Many analysts and investors expect Ryanair to raise its offer to secure more than 50 percent of 
shares.
Ranged against Ryanair's bid is the government, which has retained a 25.1 percent stake; an Aer Lingus pilots 
pension fund that holds about 2.5 percent; and Irish telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien, who bought 2.1 percent of 
shares this month with the stated aim of thwarting O'Leary's gambit.
Transport Minister Martin Cullen said the government was confident that most shareholders would reject Ryanair's 
offer. He said ceding control of Aer Lingus to Ryanair would leave Ireland with only "one model" of airline. "We need 
a diversity of models in the market," he said.
The swing vote is probably held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust, which holds Aer Lingus shares on behalf 
of 4,700 current and former employees. O'Leary is wooing the trust's directors and members by offering them a tax-
free way to cash in their shares by using the profits to buy and hold Ryanair shares for at least three years.
The ESOT directors have not declared their position. But the directors confirmed Monday they had purchased more 
than 15.5 million shares, or nearly 3 percent of the company, from the government at the original IPO price of €2.20 
(US$2.78). That took ESOT's share of ownership to nearly 12.6 percent.
As part of winning labor-union support for its privatization plan, the government pledged to give ESOT an option to 
buy up to 3 percent of its shares in subsequent years at the IPO price. Analysts said ESOT snapped up their 
maximum allotment to strengthen its leverage with Ryanair, which has publicly insisted it will not raise its offer.
James Forbes, an analyst at Hibernian Investment Managers in Dublin, said Ryanair should open negotiations 
speedily with ESOT chiefs in hopes of striking a deal at the current €2.80 offer. "There's no point in putting in a 
higher bid at the moment," he said.

Body
Ryanair published its take over document for Aer Lingus this morning. 
It is offering E500 million to the Government for its shareholding and a total of E220 million to members of an 
employee trust.
The document, which relates to Ryanair's all cash offer of E2.80 per share in Aer Lingus, is being posted to all Aer 
Lingus shareholders today. The no-frills airline claims that employee shareholders stand to make E60,000 each that 
could, under certain conditions, be free of tax. Meanwhile, Minister for Social Welfare and Family Affairs, Seamus 
Brennan has warned Aer Lingus pilots against using their pension fund in their efforts to thwart Ryanair's bid for Aer 
Lingus. Last week, the Pensions Board cautioned that the pilots' strategy of buying shares to block Ryanair's bid 
could reduce the Aer Lingus share price as it could result in a loss on the investment for the pension fund and its 
pensioners. The trustees of the Aer Lingus pilots' fund were told they have a duty to act in the best financial interest 
of members In a television interview, Minister Brennan said, "Pension funds have trustees; it's the job of the 
trustees to act on behalf of the pensioners, not to have any other objective." "If it's their objective to get some power 
play as to who owns the airline and that's their main objective, then I would caution against that," he said. 
Meanwhile, An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has again stressed that the Government would not be selling its Aer Lingus 
shares to the low fares airline and said the proposed take over is not something he believes will happen.

Section: LEX COLUMN; Pg. 16
Length: 310 words
Body
The one puzzle about Neuf Cegetel's initial public offering is why it is happening at all. There is already a potential 
buyer for the French telecoms business - namely, SFR, which is among its main competitors and happens to be a 
dominant shareholder too.
SFR's potential interest in one day taking over Neuf is part of the attraction for institutional investors. After all, 
investors recently saw Aer Lingus become the subject of a takeover bid from rival airline Ryanair just days after its 
float in early October.
But this is a risky basis on which to buy into Neuf's float. It is odd that SFR has not sewn up a deal to buy Neuf 
before the IPO gathered momentum - even if the float is being used as a lever to force SFR into making an offer. In 
2005, Liberty Global snapped up Cablecom just a day after the Swiss cable group set the price range for a 
proposed float.
Investors should ask instead whether SFR may be content to squat on the register of its rival for a while yet. And 
viewed on a standalone basis, Neuf does not look like a must-have. For all its broadband potential, it is still exposed 
to the challenging French fixed-line telephony market, and its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation are forecast to grow at mid single-digit rates from 2007.
Neuf probably merits a valuation closer to France Telecom than to the already expensive, fast-growing broadband 
star Iliad. On this basis, a sensible IPO valuation would be 6.2 times 2007 forecast ebitda, giving an enterprise 
value of about Euros 4.2bn, and an equity value - adjusting for debt, deferred tax credits, float proceeds and the 
cost of acquiring AOL France - of Euros 3.9bn. This is at the lower end of the stated range.
SFR may yet acquire Neuf before it floats. If not, investors should not buy the shares in the hope that they will 
command a lasting bid premium.

Both billionaire, Denis O'Brien, and Aer Lingus pilots are bout of pocket substantially from their efforts to thwart 
Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus.
Mr O'Brien last week bought nine million shares in Aer Lingus at E2.95 each with a E26.5 million price 
At the close of trading on Friday on the Irish Stock Exchange the airline's shares were worth E2.80 a piece, bringing 
Mr O'Brien's shareholding down to E25.2 million - a E1.3 million loss in just under a week.
 Meanwhile, the Irish Airline Pilots' Pension Fund is also suffering. It has bought Aer Lingus shares at the top end of 
their market prices with one ten-million share lot bought for E3.04 a share and several other lots bought for between 
E2.87 and E2.92 a share. The pilots had lost just over E2 million by Friday's market close.

Highlight: Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid will face a further obstacle from ESOT's shareholding.
Body
Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid will face a further obstacle after new indications that just one-third of ESOT's shareholders 
are ex-employees.
Ryanair was hoping to gather support from ex-Aer Lingus staff who took redundancy over recent years and who 
might be open to its offer.
An offer document from Ryanair being sent to all Aer Lingus shareholders this morning contains details of a tax-free 
scheme Esot members could avail of and which would allow them to take the proceeds of the Ryanair offer tax-free.
 But figures released over the weekend show that only 25 per cent of the Esot's 4,700 members work outside Aer 
Lingus. A ballot of members will be needed if the Ryanair offer is to be accepted or rejected. Ryanair said on Friday 
at a press briefing that it did not have the latest figures on Esot membership or the proportion of members no longer 
working at Aer Lingus. The figures show that building support around ex-Aer Lingus employees within the Esot may 
turn out to be futile unless Ryanair improves its offer of E2.80 a share.

Budget long-haul airline Oasis to take off from Hong Kong
Budget long-haul airline Oasis to take off from Hong Kong

Dateline: HONG KONG 
Body
It's cheap as chips, feeds you hot food, provides 14 entertainment channels with a personal video screen, and you 
don't have to transit in far-flung airports.
That, at least, is what's promised for economy class travelers with Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, the first discount 
carrier to fly between Hong Kong and London. The startup airline is stirring budget travelers and competitors with its 
combination of long-haul, low-cost flights and full services.
Oasis, which is scheduled to begin flying its first passengers Wednesday, is charging fares as low as HK$1,000 
(US$130; €105) before taxes for a one-way direct flight to London one-third of the lowest price currently available. 
Flying business class starts at HK$6,600 (US$850; €675) one-way.
Those are thrillingly low prices, but Oasis says it doesn't combine them with the no-frills approach taken by other 
budget airlines. Economy travelers will get free in-flight entertainment and two hot meals with the option of paying 
for a meal upgrade.
It's an unusual business model, but chief executive Stephen Miller is confident it will work.
"We're starting a new breed of airline," says Miller, a veteran of the aviation industry. Oasis is different from 
easyJet, Ryanair or Malaysia's AirAsia not only because it offers full service but also because it has no plans to fly 
regional short-haul, he says.
"We cannot be compared with those, although we're taking the best of the low-cost model that can be transferred to 
the long-haul," Miller says.
Oasis, which owns two Boeing 747-400s, will fly to London's Gatwick airport four times a week in its first month, 
expanding to daily flights in November.
It also plans to fly direct to Oakland, California which like Gatwick is a hub for low-cost carriers once it has bought 
three more aircraft in 2007. European cities such as Berlin and Milan are other likely destinations.
Budget long-haul airline Oasis to take off from Hong Kong
Flying only long haul allows the carrier to get the best use of its aircraft and keep productivity high, Miller says. That, 
combined with cost-cutting measures such as outsourcing catering and call centers, will be the key to Oasis's low 
prices, he says.
Miller, who founded Hong Kong's Dragonair, says he came up with the idea for Oasis when he realized there was a 
shortage of affordable direct flights to Europe and that large numbers of passengers are traveling to Europe via 
stops like Dubai and Helsinki.
Oasis was born when Miller approached pastor and property businessman Raymond Lee, who with his wife and 
two others invested HK$800 million in the airline.
"We feel there is a niche for the service we're trying to offer," Miller says. The plan is simple: to attract budget 
travelers already flying indirect long-haul routes to take a direct flight at the same price.
"There's not a huge amount of risk there, if we simply transfer them from the indirect to the direct service," he says.
The initial response in Britain and in Hong Kong has been encouraging; Oasis has already sold 19,000 tickets for 
flights up to April 2007, Miller says.
The four other carriers flying direct between Hong Kong and London are feeling the heat. Some have slashed fares, 
but none offers anything as cheap as Oasis Qantas lowered its round-trip fares to HK$3,550 (US$462; €373), while 
Cathay Pacific Airways is offering a HK$4,850 (US$630; €509) round-trip.
Cathay Pacific spokeswoman Maria Yu declined to comment on whether Oasis was a threat.
"The competition for this route has always been intense, and ticket prices have been going progressively lower," Yu 
said. "But it's most important for our clients to feel our service is worth it."
Virgin Atlantic also cut its fares.
"We can't go to that kind of price level," said Virgin Atlantic public relations executive Kalo Man. "We already have a 
very stable market share in this route. But of course we'll watch how the market reacts to Oasis."
Miller says Oasis will keep at least one in 10 of all economy class seats at HK$1,000 in its first year. But he made 
no guarantees for business-class fares, and won't rule out future price hikes.
"We're determined to be a low-fare airline offering the lowest fares in the market," he says. "But in order to be a 
good airline we have to be profitable. So there's a balance."

In a typically contrary move, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, yesterday announced the details ofhis 
Euros 2.80-a-share bid for Aer Lingus without publishing the offer document itself.
These details, though interesting, do not provide a convincing argument for a tie-up. Getting it past competition 
authorities will be the first challenge. Ryanair and Aer Lingus argue about whether a merger would create a 
monopoly, but neither knows what demands Brussels might impose. The deal's rationale is also confusing. Mr 
O'Leary proposes running the airlines as separate entities - a distinction that, frankly, seems specious.
Nevertheless, the outrage with which the Irish government and Aer Lingus have met Ryanair's approach is even 
less convincing. Aer Lingus, now it is (finally) public, must be open to offers. So far, it has failed to make the case 
that any buyer should pay significantly more than the 27 per cent premium Ryanair is offering to Aer Lingus's Euros 
2.20 flotation price. Aer Lingus has done a great job redefining itself as a low-cost airline with extra service frills. But 
the value that should be placed on its business plan - predicated on turning Dublin into an international hub - is 
dubious.
The government clearly feels betrayed by Ryanair, whose development it has generously supported. Mr O'Leary, of 
course, is not beyond a bit of emoting himself. Now he must decide whether to put more money where his mouth is.

Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair known for his antipathy towards trades unions, yesterday appealed 
to the workers of Aer Lingus to accept Ryanair's offer for the rival airline as he promoted a tax-efficient scheme for 
staff to relinquish their shareholdings.
Ryanair, which has pitched a Euros 2.80 a share offer for the partially privatised company, yesterday detailed how 
members of the employee share ownership trust (Esot), which controls a 12.9 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, could 
avoid tax on any potential gains.
Under the Ryanair tax proposal, to be detailed in an offer document to shareholders on Monday, Esot members 
would reinvest the proceeds of the sale of Aer Lingus shares in Ryanair shares. These could then be sold after a 
period of time without incurring tax.
A senior trade union official: "I think if this had happened a week ago, people might have said the game's up and 
would have been ready to accept - but a lot has changed in the meantime. The Esot is now in the driving seat."
The Irish government, which retains a 28 per cent stake after the IPO, had already indicated that it would not accept 
Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 990m) bid. Last week, Denis O'Brien, the Irish telecommunications entrepreneur, 
acquired a 2.1 per cent stake and said he was "supporting" Aer Lingus and its unions in opposing the bid.
In addition, pilots have used their pension fund to acquire 2.1 per cent.
Mr O'Leary for the first time conceded publicly that it was "probably unlikely" the bid would succeed without the 
support of the Esot's members. He said: "You can take Euros 2.80 a share now in a tax-free manner and isolate 
yourself from the volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus or you can turn it down, in which case you are likely to be 
sitting on shares which will be very illiquid and will probably fall."
Union officials say there is likely to have to be a ballot of the estimated 3,500 Esot members.
O'Leary tries to woo Aer Lingus workers TRAVEL & LEISURE
John Sheehan, analyst with NCB stockbrokers, said the priorities of the individual members "will vary widely 
depending on their status, whether current or former employees, and also length of service." He added: "Ryanair's 
ability to engage with, or appeal to the Esot and the employee base directly will be the key."
While wooing the workers with this new offer, Mr O'Leary made it clear there would be significant job cuts in the 
short term. "There will be job losses but it won't be half of the 3,500 people. I'd be surprised if it was a third of the 
3,500 people," he said.
Aer Lingus shares closed down 2 cent at Euros 2.87 yesterday.

Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said Friday he would cut jobs at rival airline Aer Lingus if the budget carrier's 
takeover bid succeeds.
O'Leary spoke as Ryanair Holdings PLC presented advance details of its formal takeover offer for Aer Lingus 
Group PLC, the formerly state-controlled airline that was floated on the British and Irish stock exchanges Sept. 27.
In surprise move, Ryanair quickly acquired 19.2 percent of the shares and offered €2.80 (US$3.55) for the rest a 27 
percent premium over the IPO price in a hostile takeover bid unveiled Oct. 5. Europe's no-frills leader planned to 
publish its formal plans Monday morning.
But O'Leary offered details of the sales pitch at a Dublin news conference that contained equal measures of carrot 
and stick.
He criticized Aer Lingus' current 3,300-strong staff as bloated, particularly in its clerical and catering divisions. He 
noted Aer Lingus employed 600 people in clerical positions, Ryanair just 40, and wondered why Aer Lingus 
employed caterers at all when it largely "buys in sandwiches like Ryanair."
"There is no doubt in my mind there would be significant job losses at Aer Lingus if Ryanair's bid succeeds," 
O'Leary said.
He also conceded that Ryanair's bid could hinge on whether the Aer Lingus employees' own share-ownership trust 
decides to back the bid.
The Employee Share Ownership Trust, or ESOT, owns more than 11 percent of shares but has declined to take a 
stand pending the publication of Ryanair's official takeover plan. The government, an Aer Lingus pilots pension fund 
and Irish telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien which together control about 33 percent of shares have already declared 
their opposition.
"If the ESOT rejects this offer, we're unlikely to get 50.1 percent," O'Leary said, referring to the threshold required 
for a successful takeover.

But he argued that Aer Lingus employees would be foolish not to take the offer because they would receive profits 
exceeding €60,000 (US$75,000) per employee. These profits would be tax-free, he said, if beneficiaries chose to 
put their money directly into Ryanair shares.
He said that, with the exception of catering and clerical positions, Aer Lingus employees could be confident that 
accepting Ryanair's bid would safeguard their jobs.
"A lot of you are not in danger of losing your jobs," O'Leary said, arguing that Ryanair's cut-throat strategies for 
expanding its routes and filling seats meant "Aer Lingus will actually grow."
He warned that Aer Lingus shares were likely to fall substantially if Ryanair's bid failed. They closed Friday down 
0.7 percent at €2.86 (US$3.64).
The shares have remained above Ryanair's €2.80 offer for the past two weeks, blocking Ryanair hopes of building 
its stake. Takeover laws prevent Ryanair from buying Aer Lingus shares above its offer price.
O'Leary painted a bleak future for Aer Lingus if it didn't join forces with Ryanair. He said it would grow "increasingly 
irrelevant," and would "continue to lurch from crisis to crisis." He said it would be "dominated by government and 
trade union interests, which unfortunately means more strikes and stoppages and bad working practices."
Aer Lingus was one of the world's few profitable state-owned airlines at the time of its flotation, but four years ago it 
nearly went bankrupt because of inefficiencies and lost business from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United 
States. Aer Lingus rebounded by slashing its staff nearly in half, switching to a Ryanair-style Internet sales model, 
and refocusing its business on lower-fare, European destinations.

Body
Ryanair has warned that shares in Aer Lingus will fall substantially if its proposed takeover fails.
The claim was made by Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary in a briefing for reporters ahead of the release on 
Monday of its formal proposal document.
He said that failure would mean a collapse in confidence in the stock which would 'flounder' as Aer Lingus faced the 
future as a small regional airline in a competitive market with an uncompetitive cost base, he said.
 He added that the sustainability of Aer Lingus profitability is 'uncertain'. He said that, should Aer Lingus 
shareholders not support the takeover offer of E280 per share, Aer Lingus fares would continue to rise and that 
Ryanair would compete vigorously with it and beat it on price every time. Mr O'Leary said the rise from the IPO 
price of E2.20 per share to its current E2.85+ price had been sustained on the back of the Ryanair offer and would 
settle back to the E2.20 mark or below if it failed. He added that, even if the deal founders, Ryanair was committed 
to being a significant minority stakeholder. O'Leary said Ryanair would not increase the offer of E2.80 per share for 
Aer Lingus but would offer a tax efficient way for members of the Aer Lingus employee share ownership trust 
(ESOT) to take the money without paying so much tax. He also suggested that his company would concentrate job 
cuts in Aer Lingus in its catering and clerical divisions if it buys the airline.

Highlight: The ISEQ index ended its day down 30 points in Dublin after a lacklustre day's trading.
Body
The Dublin market has closed the week with a particularly lacklustre performance with little in the way of news to 
spike investors' interest and as the two biggest capped stocks declined to profit taking.
Finance Minister, Brian Cowen's pre-Budget outlook gave an assurance that he will not interfere with stamp duty 
but instead indicated that the focus would be on tax band and credit changes to benefit the lower paid.
Mr Cowen's Budget Outlook yesterday showed that he believes that volatility of economic growth should be kept to 
a minimum despite the release of SSIA funds equivalent to 10pc of GDP between this year and next. He sees GDP 
growth of 5.25pc in 2006, followed by 5.0pc and 4.5pc in 2007 and 2008, respectively.
 None of this proved enough, however, to stimulate buying on the ISEQ today, with both financials and building 
stocks mostly in the red. There was also some concern in the market over what now appears to be a marked 
slowdown in the property market, especially second hand home sales. More than half the properties put up for sale 
at yesterday's auctions failed to sell by the day's close of business. There has also been extensive commentary in 
recent weeks that the possibility of stamp duty reductions or amendment to the rate bands is putting activity in the 
property market on hold as owner-occupiers in particular defer purchases. "So, this (referring to Mr Cowen's 
statement) may come as some relief for the property market after a few weeks of poor auction results and a general 
uptick in concerns in the market," said Goodbody's analyst, Eamonn Hughes. AIB shares fell by 13c to 2113 as 
investors clawed back profits from last week's spike in the shares, which was prompted by rumours that Citicorp 
was running a rule over the Irish bank. Shares in the rest of the financial sector were mixed. Anglo Irish edged 9c 
lower to 1390 after it announced further expansion in the US with a new office in Chicago, Bank of Ireland was 
down 23c to 1545 and Irish Life & Permanent declined 5c to 1915. Meanwhile, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary today 
delivered a characteristically robust broadside against critics of his bid attempt for Aer Lingus and warned share 
owners in the newly floated airline that their investment could plummet if the deal is rejected. He said a rejection 
would leave an Aer Lingus that is inefficient and unprofitable and without a future in a world where consolidation is

the norm. Shareholders can read the 150-page formal offer document in full on Monday morning. Aer Lingus shares 
dropped 2c to 286 while Ryanair shares surged 16c to 871. CRH was another significant faller with the shares down 
39c to 2731. In response to the slowing housing market and a timing-related fallback in infrastructure projects, 
international broker Martin Marietta has reduced its Q3 guidance from a range of USD1.70-USD1.90, to a range of 
USD1.63-USD1.65 earnings per share. There was also an impact from weather and transportation issues, which 
negatively impacted performance in the quarter. The company remains confident for the rest of the year as 
improved pricing and falling energy prices flow through. Other shares in the construction sector were mixed with 
Grafton up 5c to 1130, McInerney down 1c to 1342 and Kingspan up 7c to 1639.

Body
Reports this morning suggest that Ryanair is threatening to stop flying to three Spanish airports due disruptions 
caused by baggage handlers.
It is believed that the no-frills airline is warning that it will withdraw services from Granada, Seville and Jerez at the 
end of next month unless there is an end to the disruptions.
The airline has described the disruptions being caused by baggage handlers as "unwarranted and unjustified".
 The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) reported on Monday that ground handling staff in Spain were 
taking strike action all this week, culminating in a 24 hour strike on October 23, as a result of "Ryanair persistently 
ignoring negotiated agreements". Speaking earlier this week, Ingo Marowsky, secretary of the ITF's civil aviation 
section said: "Discontent is never far from the surface at Ryanair, where workers feel mistrusted, marginalised and 
mistreated. With this kind of reaction to his (Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's) tactics it is no surprise that O'Leary's 
attempted takeover of Aer Lingus has been greeted with such opposition".

Body
Denis O'Brien has been asked to clarify remarks he made in support of opponents to Ryanair's hostile bid for Aer 
Lingus.
The request for clarification came from The Takeover Panel, which oversees all bids on the stock market.
Following his purchase of a 2.1pc share in the former state airline, Mr O'Brien said he had purchased the shares in 
Aer Lingus because he believes in competition and because he believes in Aer Lingus as a company.
 He added that he has agreed to support the pilots and the staff and the board and management of the company. 
The Irish Times reports that the panel is examining whether his alignment with the anti-Ryanair investors raises 
concerns on "concert party" grounds, particularly in relation to the 28pc stake held by the Government. If Mr O'Brien 
and the Government were found to be acting working together, they would have to launch a mandatory bid as their 
joint shareholding exceeds the 29.9pc threshold above which investors must mount a bid. The newspaper reports 
that the panel is understood to have asked Mr O'Brien to explain his use of the word "support".

Senior officials from the Department of Transport are today set to meet with the European Commission in to discuss

The talks in Brussels are expected to centre on whether the proposed buy-out would be in-line with European 
competition laws.
The Irish Government has already spoken out against the move and expressed concernthat it was not in the best 
interests of competition.
 Meanwhile, reports this morning suggest that Ryanair is set to unveil more details about its bid. The airline is said 
to be working on an offer document, which is expected to be released later today or on Monday. However, it is not 
expected that the Ryanair document will increase its offer of E2.80 per share. RTE suggests that the document will 
instead offer a tax efficient way for members of the Aer Lingus employee share ownership trust to take the money 
without paying so much tax.

Highlight: Sharp gains at Iona Technologies failed to inspire a sluggish Dublin market today.
Body
Sharp gains at Iona Technologies failed to inspire a sluggish Dublin market today as a mixed start on Wall Street 
weighed heavy. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 0.67 points lower on 8531.16.
Despite the Down Jones edging back above the 12,000 level for a second-straight session, sentiment in the U.S. 
was weighed down by a weak trading update from Citigroup, while oil prices rose higher. The mixed trading on Wall 
Street, combined with losses overnight in Tokyo, had a negative impact on major bourses in Europe.
 Shares in Dublin traded in the red for virtually all of the day as investors took a breather following sharp gains in 
recent weeks that have pushed the ISEQ comfortably above the 8500 level. In Dublin today, shares in Iona soared 
by almost 10pc, or 35c, to 4.05 after the software group announced strong third quarter figures with revenues up 
17pc to USD20.3 million (E16.1 million) compared to the same period last year. The firm said that sales of its Artix 
product line were up 114pc with overall product revenues increasing 25pc to USD11.7 million. Meanwhile, net 
profits would have been USD1.8 million excluding USD1.3 million in stock-based compensation expenses, which 
were included this year after an accounting change. The firm said it expects fourth quarter revenues to be in the 
range of USD20.0 - USD22.0 million with costs to be in the range of USD19.0 - USD20.0 million. In the financial 
sector, Anglo Irish Bank was in the black, up 10c to 13.95, while AIB jumped 11c to 21.26. The news was not son 
good for Bank of Ireland however who slipped 9c to 15.71 after it announced plans to sell almost half of its 
branches in the UK. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent were also in the red, slipping 14c to 19.11. In the 
construction sector, CRH was largely unchanged, losing 1c to 27.70, while Kingspan and McInerney both fell into 
negative territory, down 16c to 16.32 and 2c to 13.43 respectively. Grafton bucked the trend, tacking on 8c to 11.23. 
Shares in Aer Lingus lost 1c to close 2.88 as investors await to see whether Ryanair will up its bid for the flag 
carrier. Despite businessman Denis O'Brien snapping up more than a 2pc share in the airline, Ryanair said it 
remains confident that it will be able to complete the audacious takeover. Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot 
Iona fails to inspire sluggish ISEQ
Mannion said he did not believe that Ryanair would be able to overcome all the regulatory hurdles. Shares in 
Ryanair were down 14c to 8.55 in Dublin today. Elsewhere, South Wharf was hit by profit taking, falling 30c to 7.70, 
while United Drug closed 2c lower on 3.45 and FBD Holdings lost 43c to 39.77. C and C was again trading higher, 
up 11c to 12.01, as it continues to enjoy a positive stream of broker comment after it last week posted strong first 
half earnings. The drinks and snacks group reported a stronger than expected 77pc jump in first half earnings and 
said its thriving Magners and Bulmers cider brands should also ensure stronger profit growth in the second half. 
Blackrock International was in the black, tacking on 1c to 0.38, along with DCC, which jumped 18c to 20.38. Shares 
in Paddy Power and Elan were both unchanged on 14.45 and 12.25 respectively.

The tribunal convened to look into a secret deal between Ryanair and City of Derry Airport hears closing arguments 
today.
The Information Tribunal is hearing an appeal from airport-owners Derry City Council against a ruling it must reveal 
financial details of its contract with the low-cost carrier.
The disclosure order followed a Freedom of Information request, and it is believed the case could impact on all UK 
public bodies doing business with private companies.
 The final day's hearing is expected to centre on legal arguments and the exemptions claimed by Derry City Council 
under the Freedom of Information Act to withhold the documents. An EU ruling in 2004 that Charleroi Airport, in 
Belgium, was acting illegally in providing state funding to Ryanair will also be raised. Mr McGurk yesterday 
confirmed the airport was costing ratepayers in the region of £1.3m a year, and that Derry householders pay among 
the highest rates in the Six Counties.

Body
The battle to block Ryanair's hostile bid for Aer Lingus is heating up with Aer Lingus employee shareholders fund, 
Esot, set to up its stake.
Several members of the Esot have told The Irish Times that opposition to the bid is significant among trustees, with 
the chances of a positive result from a ballot of staff members extremely slim.
Meanwhile, investment groups such as Gartmore and JP Morgan Asset Management now have leading positions in 
the airline, it has emerged. JP Morgan has a 3.1 per cent stake in the airline, while Gartmore controls 1.1 per cent. 
The Irish banks AIB and Bank of Ireland also have substantial stakes.
 Based on these figures, JP Morgan could play a pivotal role, particularly when opponents and potential opponents 
of the Ryanair bid already control approximately 45 per cent of the shares. Included in this group is the 
Government, the Esot, the pilots and Denis O'Brien. It is understood Mr O'Brien may be prepared to purchase more 
shares if required to block the Ryanair offer.

Aer Lingus pilots have raised their stake in Ireland's former state airline to 2.27 per cent, buying a further 200,000 
shares at Euros 2.87 apiece in an apparent attempt to frustrate a Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 993m) hostile takeover by 
Ryanair, its bigger Irish rival.
The stake was bought by the pension fund of the Irish association of airline pilots, an affiliate of the Impact union, 
representing pilots and cabin crew.
The move came despite concerns raised in a letter from the pensions board about the decision by trustees to invest 
the pilots pension fund in shares in their own company in the middle of a bid battle.

Budget airline Ryanair said Wednesday it will not raise the price of its hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, the 
recently privatized Irish airline whose board is increasingly confident of repelling the takeover.
Ryanair's deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, said the Oct. 5 offer of 2.80 euros ($3.55) a share was 27 
percent higher than Aer Lingus' Sept. 26 IPO price.
"This represents an extremely generous return over a very short time frame," he said.
When asked if Ryanair would consider raising its offer price to secure a majority of shares, he said, "Absolutely 
not."
Aer Lingus chiefs and market analysts, meanwhile, have appeared increasingly confident that Ryanair would fail to 
accumulate more than 50 percent of Aer Lingus' shares, the threshold necessary for a takeover.
Ryanair has acquired more than 19 percent of the shares, but is barred by law from buying more while the stock 
remains above 2.80 euros. Investors have kept the share price well above that in expectation that Ryanair would be 
forced to raise its price. They likewise dismissed Cawley's denial, driving Aer Lingus shares up 1 euro cent to 2.89 
euros ($3.65) on the Irish Stock Exchange in Wednesday afternoon trade.
To succeed, Ryanair probably will need to buy the lion's share of Aer Lingus stock not held by the government or 
Aer Lingus employees a scenario that will require the share price to fall or the Ryanair offer to rise.
"I believe we will defeat the Ryanair bid," Aer Lingus CEO Dermot Mannion said. He pointed to the difficulties that 
Ryanair would face, even if it secured a 50.1 percent shareholding, from EU competition authorities.
"There are very large regulatory hurdles to be overcome. I don't believe Ryanair can overcome them," Mannion 
said.
The government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, which has criticized the Ryanair bid, has ruled out selling its 
remaining 28.1 percent holding in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair says it won't raise price of takeover bid for rival airline Aer Lingus
Irish telecom entrepreneur Denis O'Brien shook up the markets by announcing Tuesday night he had spent 32 
million euros ($40 million) to acquire a 2.1 percent stake in Aer Lingus. O'Brien said he was acting to help block the 
Ryanair takeover, citing the need for Ireland to have at least two competing airlines.
A pension fund run by Aer Lingus pilots bought another 200,000 shares Wednesday, raising their stake to 
approximately 2.3 percent. They also oppose the Ryanair bid.
Institutional and private investors, chiefly in Ireland, Britain and the United States, hold more than 35 percent of Aer 
Lingus.
Cawley denied Dublin media reports that his boss, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, was in the United States 
specifically to lobby major U.S. shareholders to accept the Ryanair offer. He said O'Leary was in the U.S. to attend 
a conference and had no plans to meet Aer Lingus shareholders.
A possible kingmaker, holding the balance of power between Ryanair and anti-Ryanair shareholders, is a trust that 
owns about 11 percent of Aer Lingus shares on behalf of more than 3,000 Aer Lingus employees. The Employee 
Share Ownership Trust, or ESOT, has remained silent since Ryanair's surprise bid was unveiled.
While Cawley said each member of the ESOT trust would receive more than 60,000 euros ($75,000) from the 
Ryanair offer, he conceded that Irish capital-gains taxes would dramatically reduce their net profit. He said Ryanair 
was aware that ESOT trustees might prefer to be offered a more tax-efficient deal that involved Ryanair shares, not 
just cash.
"Certainly we'll be looking at all eventualities, so that the maximum value of our offer of 2.80 euros can be secured 
by all recipients," Cawley said.

Body
Britain's antitrust regulator revealed Wednesday that it has forced budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC to extend its 
compensation for flight delays and remove exclusions on its policy for payments to travelers for lost luggage.
The Office of Fair Trading said that Ryanair's previous options for travelers facing a flight delay or cancellation did 
not reflect customers' full rights under EU law.
Likewise, the carrier's policy on lost or damaged luggage excluded payment for items such as sporting equipment, 
infant equipment, medical or mobility equipment and musical instruments.
The OFT said that Ryanair had agreed to lift the restrictions on both sets of policies.
"The OFT's action has secured improvements to Ryanair's terms that will benefit passengers," said spokesman Ray 
Hall. "We expect other airlines using similar terms to stop doing so immediately."
Ryanair made no comment on the OFT statement, but announced separately that is extending its online check-in 
and priority boarding service.
The airline said that from Nov. 1 the service will be open to all passengers, rather than only those traveling without 
checked-in bags, which is currently the case.
The carrier is charging passengers checking in luggage €3 (US$3.75) and passengers with only hand luggage €2 
(US$2.50) for the priority boarding service.
The carrier also announced that is starting two new routes from Dublin next year to Warsaw and Stockholm bringing 
its total new routes planned for 2007 to 20.

CRH led the Dublin market higher for the second day running today, while much attention was focused on Aer 
Lingus as Ryanair displayed increasing signs of desperation in its bid to get its hands on the airline.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 26.46 points higher on 8531.83.
The gains were in line with markets in London and in the US where the Dow Jones was flirting with all time highs. 
 The Dow Jones broke through the key 12,000 barrier for the first time in its history in early deals today as pleasing 
key inflation data strengthened expectations the Fed will not hike rates anytime soon. However a spike in oil prices, 
after US government data revealed domestic inventories of gasoline and heating oil fell sharply, prompted investors 
to cash in on the gains. As for the data, the consumer Price Index fell 0.5pc last month, sharper than the 0.3pc 
decline analysts had expected and the largest drop since November last year, when it declined 0.7pc. Back in 
Dublin, shares in Ryanair moved up 7c to 8.67 after the no-frills airline the introduction of two more routes from 
Dublin and said it was still confident of completing the audacious takeover of Aer Lingus. The claims came despite 
businessman Denis O'Brien confirming that he had bought a 2pc share in the airline in a bid to stop Ryanair from 
taking it over. Ryanair's deputy chief executive Michael Cawley claimed that more than one third of shares were still 
up for grabs and that it was "still in a position to gain a majority share". "We're still looking at 54-55pc of the shares, 
including our own 19pc, in hands of people who have not declared their position," he said. However, Aer Lingus 
chief executive Dermot Mannion poured scorn on Ryanair's bid, saying that he does not believe that Ryanair will be 
able to overcome all the regulatory hurdles. The Aer Lingus chief said he fully supported billionaire Denis O' Brien's 
move that saw him increasing his stake in Ireland's former national flag carrier to 2.1pc at a cost of E32m on 
Tuesday. Shares in Aer Lingus closed 1c higher on 2.89. Elsewhere, shares in CRH were in the black for the 
second consecutive day, up 27c to 27.60 after the building materials group confirmed another purchase in China 
earlier this week. Shares were also boosted by the news that the pace of US home building unexpectedly 
strengthened in September as new housing starts rose 5.9pc. CRH gains much of its revenue from the US housing

No frills airline Ryanair today announced two new routes from Dublin to Warsaw and Stockholm.
The airline said this brings the number of new routes it will launch from Dublin 2007 to 20 and the number of routes 
it operates in total from Dublin to 71.
It also said that the expansion proved there is "ample room" at Dublin Airport and will further increase competition 
between it and Aer Lingus regardless of whether the current bid succeeds or not.
 The airline also announced a new online check-in and priority boarding service enhancement that will allow all 
passengers to enjoy online check-in / priority boarding for just £2/E3 per flight from 1st November 2006. 
Passengers travelling with checked in luggage will (from 1st November) be able to enjoy priority boarding at 
departure gates for £2/E3 per flight. These passengers will then be entitled to board the aircraft first and choose 
their seats. This will be particularly advantageous for families and groups who wish to travel together. Meanwhile, 
those travelling with hand luggage only will also have the option to enjoy the double benefit of bypassing airport 
check-in queues and avail of priority boarding at the departure gate by checking in on line for just £2/E3 per flight. It 
said the new service will extend the option of priority boarding to all passengers and not just those travelling without 
checked in bags as was previously the case.

Denis O'Brien, the Irish telecommunications entrepreneur, has bought a small stake in Aer Lingus, the former Irish 
state airline that is fighting off a hostile Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 992m) bid from Ryanair, its larger rival.
Mr O'Brien, who made Pounds 240m when he sold Esat Telecom to BT in 2000, bought some 8.6m shares, or 1.61 
per cent. He said he received an approach from the Irish Association of Airline Pilots whose pension fund last week 
bought a 2 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
The shares closed unchanged at Euros 2.88.
Ryanair owns about 19 per cent of its rival, which it acquired in the wake of the initial public offering this month. The 
Irish government retains 28 per cent, while an employee trust owns more than 9 per cent.
Ryanair is offering Euros 2.80 a share, compared with the IPO price of Euros 2.20, contingent on gaining 50.1 per 
cent of the company's shares.
Ryanair last month ridiculed Mr O'Brien when promoting its new route to Malta, after it was reported that the 
businessman had taken up residence in the Mediterranean island state to reduce his tax liabilities.
A Ryanair advert featured a picture of the businessman and announced the offer of "free flights" adding that "all you 
pay is taxes". John Murray Brown, Dublin

The OFT had a number of concerns regarding Ryanair's liability for damage to or loss of luggage and delay or 
cancellation of flights and the company said it has now changed its contract with passengers to give them a fairer 
deal.
Specifically, Ryanair has removed the exclusion of liability for damage or delay to sporting equipment, infant 
equipment, medical/mobility equipment and musical instruments from its terms and conditions.
 For baggage claims Ryanair has removed the requirement for passengers to reclaim after 21 days if baggage is 
still reported as lost and not found. Ryanair's liability in the event that flights are delayed or cancelled, or 
passengers are denied boarding on a flight have also been amended.

Billionaire, Denis O'Brien, has bought a 2.1pc stake in the recently privatised Aer Lingus and wants to help block a 
hostile takeover bid by Ryanair.
Mr O'Brien said he had purchased the shares in Aer Lingus because he believes in competition. He added that he 
believes Aer Lingus, as a company, had a strong national and international reputation.
He said he has agreed to support the pilots and the staff and the board and management of the company.
 Ryanair holds more than 19pc of the shares but requires more than 50pc to mount a successful takeover. It is 
legally barred from increasing its holding while the share price remains above its E2.80 offer. The government still 
holds more than 28pc of the shares and has ruled out the prospect of selling to Ryanair. A long-established share 
ownership trust for the entire Aer Lingus work force, representing more than 3,300 people, owns more than 11pc of 
shares. A new trust representing Aer Lingus pilots had built up a 2.24pc stake as of Tuesday.

SIPTU workers at Aer Lingus are to stage a protest outside the Dail this morning to highlight their opposition to 
Ryanair's takeover bid.
The union has come out strongly against the move, which it says would be bad for workers, passengers and the 
country in general.
It has also called on the Government to buy back shares in the national carrier in order to block Ryanair's bid.
 Yesterday, businessman Denis O'Brien announced that he had bought up 2.1pc of Aer Lingus shares for E32m in 
a move to prevent the takeover. He said he was making the move in support of the airline's staff and management 
and because he believed in competition.

Irish tycoon Denis O'Brien said Tuesday he has bought a 2.1 percent stake in the recently privatized airline Aer 
Lingus Group PLC and wants to help block a hostile takeover bid by rival carrier Ryanair.
The intervention by O'Brien, who has made billions developing mobile-phone companies from Ireland to the 
Caribbean, represented the first confirmed effort by a third party to oppose the takeover bid launched Oct. 5 by 
Ryanair Holdings PLC.
The surprise attack by Ryanair, Europe's fastest-growing airline, came just a week after the government sold its 
majority stake in Aer Lingus, one of the world's few profitable state-owned airlines.
The Irish government, Aer Lingus management and labor unions all oppose the Ryanair offer of 2.80 euros ($3.55) 
a share, which is a 27 percent premium over Aer Lingus' Sept. 27 IPO price of 2.20 euros ($2.79).
Since the bid was announced, Aer Lingus shares have remained well above the Ryanair offer price they closed 
Tuesday at 2.87 euros ($3.65) in expectation that Ryanair would raise its offer.
O'Brien said in a statement he had purchased more than 32 million euros ($40 million) of Aer Lingus shares 
because he didn't want Ryanair to strangle airline competition in Ireland. He said his move was designed to bolster 
existing efforts by investment trusts representing Aer Lingus employees to build up a blocking share.
Ryanair holds more than 19 percent of the shares but requires more than 50 percent to mount a successful 
takeover. It is legally barred from increasing its holding while the share price remains above its euros 2.80 offer.
The government still holds more than 28 percent of the shares and has ruled out the prospect of selling to Ryanair. 
A long-established share ownership trust for the entire Aer Lingus work force, representing more than 3,300 people, 
owns more than 11 percent of shares. A new trust representing Aer Lingus pilots had built up a 2.24 percent stake 
as of Tuesday.

Shares on the Dublin closed modestly lower today as investors pocketed gains from the previous day.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 22.45 points lower on 8505.37.
The falls were in line with a negative start to trade on Wall Street and falls on major bourses around Europe.
 US stocks were dragged under as investors took profits after the Dow closed at yet another record high on 
Monday, having almost hit the 12,000 mark during the session. Today's sentiment was also damaged by a higher-
than-expected reading of core inflation in September, which jumped 0.6pc last month excluding energy and food, 
the biggest increase in this area in 20 months. However, including energy and food, wholesale inflation plunged by 
the largest amount in more than three years in September as a record drop in the cost of gasoline offset rising 
prices in a number of other areas. In Dublin, the banks were the biggest drag on the market with AIB giving away 
over 2pc, falling 49c to 21.06 and Irish Life and Permanent down 11c to 19.53. Anglo Irish Banks was down 3c to 
13.83, while Bank of Ireland closed flat on 13.83. CRH was the day's biggest gainer, tacking on 55c to 27.35, after 
the building materials group confirmed another purchase in China, following its first acquisition in the country last 
week. The strong sentiment spread to Grafton, whose shares closed 10c higher on 11.15, however, Kingspan 
slipped 29c to 16.24, while McInerney remained unchanged on 13.38. After its sharp gains on Monday, C and C 
was hit by profit taking yesterday, sending shares down 19c to 11.95. The drinks and snacks group has saw its 
share price soar after it reported a stronger than expected 77pc jump in first half earnings earlier this month. It said 
its thriving Magners and Bulmers cider brands should also ensure stronger profit growth in the second half. South 
Wharf was again in the black after it was reported over the weekend that it is set to pocket hundreds of millions of 
euro from the sale of the former Irish Glass Bottle factory in Ringsend. is set to fetch more than E500m. The 25-
acre site, which is being sold by South Wharf and Dublin Port, is expected to fetch over E500m. South Wharf will 
receive 66.4pc of the proceeds. Shares closed up 14c to 7.89 in Dublin today. Shares in Ryanair jumped 5c to 8.60 
with investors keenly awaiting any new developments in its attempt to takeover Aer Lingus. The airline has been 
ISEQ down 22pts as profit-takers pounce
tight-lipped in recent days, however much attention will be focused on its press briefing scheduled for tomorrow 
morning. Meanwhile the news that Aer Lingus pilots had taken their share in the flag carrier to 2.24pc had little 
impact on the share price, with Aer Lingus closing flat on 2.88. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 20c to 
14.40, while United Drug fell 2c to 3.43 and Elan shed 11c to 12.31. Irish Continental Group closed in the black, up 
20c to 12.20, while Iona Technology tacked on 15c to 3.75 and Irish Estates jumped 10c to 4.55.

Just before midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 26.54 to 8501.28.
The morning session's main fallers were the financials, with AIB falling 27c to 21.28, Anglo Irish Bank down 3c to

 CRH was popular with investors after it announced another move into China, following its first acquisition in the 
country last week. The building materials firm plans to acquire a 26pc stake in the cement operations of the Jilin

Greencore fell 1c to 4.01. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 2c to 2.90 after it was confirmed to the Irish Stock

A statement to the Irish Stock Exchange today showed that Aer Lingus Pilots bought up more shares in the airline 
yesterday, taking their stake to 2.24pc.
The statement said that they had bought 300,000 shares at E2.90 per share, meaning that they spent a total of 
E870,000.
The buy-up of shares is part of an attempt by the pilots to block a hostile bid from Ryanair.
 Aer Lingus rejected a E2.80 per share, or E1.48bn, offer from Ryanair earlier this month. Ryanair has amassed a 
19.2pc stake in Aer Lingus, however, and has made its offer conditional on securing 50.1pc. The Irish government 
holds 28pc and is opposed to the bid. Aer Lingus employees hold 15pc.

Denis O'Brien has pitched into the battle to stop Michael O'Leary taking over Aer Lingus.
The billionaire telecoms entrepreneur revealed last night that he had bought 2.1pc of the airline's shares for 32m 
euro.
In a statement he said that he had done so because he believes in competition.
 O'Brien had previously criticised Ryanair's bid for the newly privatised airline, but now he has put his money where 
his mouth is. His relations wit h O'Leary are widely thought to have hit a low when Ryanair ran a recent advert 
referring to O'Brien's decision to move his tax domicile to Malta. The advert suggested that he had been attracted 
by Ryanair's virtually free fares to the island, adding that all he had to pay to go were taxes and charges. His 
investment announcement comes in the wake of Aer Lingus pilots bringing their holding in the airline up to 2.24pc.

Body
Fine Gael's transport spokeswoman, Olivia Mitchell, has warned the Government not to be tempted to give in to 
union pressure to buy back Aer Lingus in an effort to keep it out of the hands of Ryanair.
She said that, if the government were to raise its stake in Aer Lingus to beyond 29pc, it would be obliged to make a 
bid for the company.
She said that to spend up to E1 billion on buying a bigger share of the airline after having sold the company a few 
weeks ago for E200 million is 'unsustainable'.
 She added that any attempt by the State to buy back Aer Lingus would land the taxpayer with a massive bill, 'for a 
company which needs to be in the private sector in order to survive'. "SIPTU's proposition that having sold the 
company a few weeks ago for E200 million, the State should now pay E1 billion to buy it back, is unsustainable. 
The State sold the majority of its own shareholding for E200 million, but it also created new shares which raised 
E534 million for Aer Lingus. An offer would have to be made for all of these shares at more than the current market 
price, which has gone up by around a third since the shares were issued,' she said.

CAE Inc. has won 65 million Canadian dollars ($57.1 million) worth of orders for six full-flight simulators, training 
devices and simulator upgrades, with most of them being purchased by European discount airline Ryanair, the 
company announced Monday.
Ryanair is buying five Boeing 737NG Level B full-flight simulators, taking delivery of one each year from 2008 to 
2012, while Prescient Systems & Technologies is purchasing a full-flight simulator for the Airbus A-320.
Prescient will use its simulator at the new aviation training center in the Philippines.
The orders bring CAE's total number of full-flight simulator sales to 19 for the 2007 financial year, which ends in 
March.
"This contract with Prescient once again demonstrates CAE's continued success in the growing Asian aviation 
market, where the company is committed to playing a key role in developing the industry by offering a wide range of 
solutions," said Marc Parent, CAE's Group president for the simulation products department.
CAE also announced separately that it has signed an agreement with Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer to 
form a global training joint venture.
The initial training program will be offered at CAE's SimuFlite operation in Dallas. There are also plans to expand to 
Western Europe and the eastern United States.
The joint venture will provide comprehensive pilot and ground crew training to Embraer customers of the Phenom 
100 Very Light Jet and Phenom 300 Light Jet aircraft.
CAE and Embraer will work together to develop all required courseware and provide a team of qualified instructors. 
As part of the training program, CAE will design and manufacture full-flight simulators and combine CAE Simfinity 
technology and devices into the Phenom training program.
CAE also said it won contracts to provide several unnamed airlines and aircraft manufacturers with CAE Simfinity 
PC-based training software.

No-frills airline Ryanair is facing industrial action in both Italy and Spain, according to the International Transport 
Workers' Federation (ITF).
In a statement, the ITF said that in Italy, the Irish carrier's employees are refusing to sell non-essential 'extras', such 
as hot drinks, food and alcohol.
It said the workers are protesting because after they joined the Fit Cisl Comparto Volo union to represent them, 
Ryanair refused to engage in talks and tried to transfer the staff who had been nominated as union representatives.
 In Spain, the ITF said ground handling staff will take strike action from today, culminating in a 24 hour strike on Oct 
23. This follows what their union, the Comisiones Obreras, describes as Ryanair persistently ignoring negotiated 
agreements, the right to join a union and statutory requirements. 'Discontent is never far from the surface at 
Ryanair, where workers feel mistrusted, marginalised and mistreated,' said Ingo Marowsky, secretary of the ITF's 
civil aviation section. 'With this kind of reaction to his (Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's) tactics it is no surprise that 
O'Leary's attempted takeover of Aer Lingus Group PLC has been greeted with such opposition,' he said. Earlier this 
month Aer Lingus rejected a E1.48 billion offer from Ryanair.

Minister for Transport Martin Cullen was criticised for not permitting competition in the Dublin bus market.
Addressing the annual conference of the Dublin Economics Workshop in Kenmare, competition economist Pat 
Massey said the Republic was lagging behind the rest of the world by its failure to reform the bus industry, the Irish 
Times reported.
In a paper entitled Delayed Indefinitely, Mr Massey, a former chairman of the Competition Authority, argued that the 
lack of competition allowed inefficiency to persist. He described this as a "sizeable hidden cost of social 
partnership".
 Mr Massey contrasted the Government's stance on bus deregulation with remarks made by Mr Cullen in the Dail 
last week in respect of the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, in which the Minister warned of a possible monopoly in air 
travel. "It is somewhat disappointing that the Minister has failed to apply the same logic in the case of bus services," 
he said yesterday.

Competition issues arising from Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) bid for Aer Lingus would have to be 
considered by the authorities in Dublin as well as in Brussels, Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus chief executive, said 
yesterday as he mounted theairline's defence.
The financial scale of a merger of the two airlines - a combined turnover of more than Euros 2.5bn and sales in at 
least three individual markets of more than Euros 100m - would formally place scrutiny of the bid within the 
jurisdiction of the European competition authorities.
Mr Mannion said the impact on the Irish aviation market and on Dublinairport would be so great that the Irish 
Competition Authority would also have to request a role in the investigation.
In each of the top five aviation markets from Ireland to the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, a merged 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus group would have a market share of more than 80 per cent of the available seat capacity, Mr 
Mannion said yesterday. "That says it all."
Aer Lingus would be focusing on the Irish market dimension, said Mr Mannion. "I don't believe this can be resolved 
through the competition remedy of Ryanair giving up (take-off and landing) slots (to potential competitors). The 
regulatory hurdles will be too great for Ryanair to overcome."
Ryanair last week launched a Euros 2.80 a share all-cash offer for Aer Lingus and had captured a stake of 19.2 per 
cent before the Aer Lingus share price rose above the offer price. It is seeking a controlling stake of at least 50.1 
per cent.
The Irish government has refused to sell its remaining 28.3 per cent stake and has accused Ryanair of trying to 
recreate a monopoly in the Irish aviation sector.
A further 9.65 per cent stake is held by the Aer Lingus employee share ownership trust, 2.18 per cent is held by an 
Aer Lingus pilots pension fund and a stake of 2.47 per cent is believed to have been bought by Aer Lingus 
employees in last month's initial public offering, priced at Euros 2.20 a share.

The Irish government is seeking talks with European Union antitrust authorities to discuss Ryanair Holdings PLC's 
surprise takeover bid for Aer Lingus Group PLC, officials said Friday.
Aer Lingus, its employees and the Irish government rejected Ryanair's €1.48 billion (US$1.86 billion) offer for the 
carrier last week.
"We have been contacted by the Irish government with a view to set up a meeting next week," said EU spokesman 
Jonathan Todd.
He said it was not unusual for contacts to take place before a bid is notified and said it was up to Ryanair whether to 
bring the case before the EU or the Irish competition authorities.
Ryanair's bid is conditional on it gaining 50.1 percent of Aer Lingus. It currently holds 19.2 percent after buying up 
shares last week.
Pilots for Aer Lingus revealed Friday that they had bought more shares in the carrier, increasing their stake slightly 
to 2.18 percent. The Irish Airline Pilots Pension Group has been increasing its holding in small increments since 
Ryanair launched its bid.
The pilots have declined to comment on the purchases, but analysts said the move could be part of a creeping 
equity grab designed to block Ryanair's takeover.
The Irish government sold most of its holding in the previously state-owned carrier, but still holds a 28 percent stake 
in Aer Lingus. It has pledged to retain a minimum 25.1 percent stake the minimum required to block any attempt by 
a majority owner to have the company de-listed from stock markets.
The current government stake, combined with the pilots' holdings and the 12 percent owned by employee share 
ownership trusts, gives government and staff just over 42 percent of the carrier.
Opponents to the takeover claim it will wipe out competition, drive up prices and lead to job cuts. Labor leaders are 
also concerned that Ryanair does not recognize union rights, insisting instead of individual staff contracts.
EU official says Ireland wants meeting over Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
Analysts said that Ryanair was unlikely to succeed without raising its offer price. They believe the discount carrier, 
which has rapidly expanded across Europe but never mounted such an ambitious takeover bid before, certainly 
could afford to raise its offer, because it has cash reserves exceeding €2 billion (US$2.6 billion).

Mannion hits out at Ryanair over bid
Mannion hits out at Ryanair over bid

Highlight: Aer Lingus boss Dermot Mannion says it is "almost inconceivable" that his team could integrate with 
Ryanair.
Body
Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion has said that it is "almost inconceivable" that his company's 
management could be integrated with that of Ryanair.
He has also claimed that enough investors in the new floated airline will remain loyal to it to see off the bid from the 
no frills carrier.
Speaking on radio tonight he said: "We very successfully sold the Aer Lingus business case to investors and have 
been interacting with them since then.
 "I confidently expect that we will retain more than enough support to fend off the Ryanair bid." Mr Mannion said 
investors had been enthusiastic about the airline's business case for independent growth and he predicted that it 
would "comfortably retain" their support. Asked whether he agreed it was up to government to help defend the 
airline from the bid, he replied "No", adding: "Clearly if they recently sold shares in the market, we wouldn't expect 
government to be in the market to buy shares back." He also declined to speak in favour of workers using pension 
funds to buy shares. "In relation to purchases by any of the pension funds, that is something the company has no 
influence over or involvement in." As regards using competition rules to ward off Ryanair, he said: "That is a matter 
for regulators but our assessment is that .. the hurdles are very significant and I don't believe Ryanair is capable of 
surpassing these hurdles." Mr Mannion insisted that there was "great unity of purpose" within Aer Lingus. The IPO 
process had achieved its objectives of finding money for new aircraft and to dealing with the pension gap. Right 
now it was "very much business as usual" within the company. Asked why not team up with Ryanair, the chief 
executive said Aer Lingus had a product which offered "differentiating factors that the public value". "We compete 
aggressively and that is to the benefit of the Irish travelling public," he said. "Aer Lingus knows better than anyone 
how to compete with Ryan air and have done so successfully for 20 years. "We are Europe's second most 
profitable airline....Aer Lingus is very successful by Ryanair's own admission." Mr Mannion denied that there were 
Mannion hits out at Ryanair over bid
synergies that could be exploited in terms of aircraft purchasing. He said Ryanair operated a totally Boeing 737 
fleet, whereas Aer Lingus had a totally Airbus fleet. It was only now beginning to reap the savings that flowed from 
having a unified fleet and it was "inconceivable that any time soon we would go back to mixed fleet operation" 
Asked if he could work with Michael O'Leary, he said: "I don't think in all honesty, not to personalise this too much, 
that in any circumstances would management would work successfully with Ryanair." It was "almost inconceivable" 
that the two managements teams could be integrated. He said his message to Aer Lingus staff was: "Business as 
usual."

Body
Having missed a huge opportunity to buy Aer Lingus shares before the raid and bid from Michael O'Leary's Ryanair, 
the pilots' pension scheme has upped its stake to 2.18%, buying 300,000 shares at 2.92.
It appears that Aer Lingus pilots are so desperate to keep out of Ryanairs clutches that they are prepared to take 
risks with their pensions.
Collins Stewart analyst Andrew Fitchie says the pension fund could have picked the shares up after last weeks Aer 
Lingus (AERL) floatation for as little as 2.30.
But he says the pilot pension scheme has paid up to 3.04 a share. He reckons that including the Irish governments 
28% stake, shareholders hostile to Ryanair (RYA) hold around 40% of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair needs 50.1% to win and has already accumulated a 19.2% stake - at far lower prices than Aer Lingus 
luckless pilots.
The shares, up 5 cents at 2.93, are trading well above Ryanairs 2.80 bid suggesting Ryanair will have to go higher.
Fitchie believes Ryanair could come back at, or slightly above 3 and still make money.
There are the slots at Heathrow which are worth several hundred million, there are savings to be made at Aer 
Lingus in efficiency cuts and then there is the opportunity to create a national champion' he said.

Body
Pilots working for Aer Lingus have increased their stake in the Irish flag carrier to 2.18pc in an attempt to help block 
a hostile takeover bid by Ryanair , Europe's largest no-frills carrier.
A statement to the stock exchange revealed that Irish Airline Pilots Pensions yesterday bought 300,000 shares in 
Aer Lingus at E2.92 a share.
Last week Aer Lingus rejected a E2.80 a share, or E1.48bn, offer from Ryanair.
 However, Ryanair has amassed a 19.2pc stake in Aer Lingus and has made its offer conditional on securing 
50.1pc. The Irish government holds 28pc and is opposed to the bid. Aer Lingus employees hold a further 15pc. 
Meanwhile, union representatives at the airline are reportedly calling for the staff pension fund to be used to buy up 
shares in the airline. Union officials reportedly want to acquire up to 6pc of shares, which would make it a lot more 
difficult for the no-frills airline to succeed in its hostile takeover bid.

The Dublin market climbed out of the red today as investors turned to AIB after rumours that the world's biggest 
bank was running the rule over it and as Ryanair shares rose.
By 11:15, the ISEQ index was up 14.73 points to 8,471.57.
Shares in AIB rose for the second day today following reports that Citigroup was having a look at it. In the last few 
weeks, rumours about a possible European move by Citi have been doing the rounds and last week's interview with 
CEO Chuck Prince and Citi's Q3 numbers have served to perpetuate the rumours, according to Goodbody analyst, 
Eamonn Hughes.
 "We can't say definitively that it would not consider one of the Irish banks, but it strikes us it would make sense that 
any transaction in Western Europe would look to give it a toehold in a number of European markets. Buying AIB 
would also give it a large position in a major European market that it could grow via acquisition in due course, he 
added. The speculation sent shares up 40c to 2175.

Body
Drug development group, Amarin, which is a spin-off from Elan, has been granted approval for its patent application 
covering the use of its proprietary ultra-pure ethyl-EPA compound Miraxion in Huntington's disease by the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office.
Rick Stewart, Chief Executive Officer said, "We believe this patent substantially enhances Miraxion's already 
significant commercial potential. Amarin has additional patents granted for Miraxion in other central nervous system 
disorders, such as depression, and has many patents pending for a range of indications. We are committed to 
further strengthening our existing intellectual property portfolio to protect the future market for Miraxion."
Earlier this year, the company reported a pre-tax loss of USD6.98 million for the second quarter to June 30, from a 
loss of 6.39 million a year before, and said it should have enough cash to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 
2007 -- and beyond if revenue is generated from potential partnerships.
 It noted that its widened net loss -- which stood at USD6.8 million against USD6.1 million last time -- was a result of 
substantial R and D investments, in particular for final-phase trials of Miraxion. Amarin was founded by former Elan 
finance director Tom Lynch and also includes Ryanair-founder Tony Ryan on its share register.

Financial shares led the Dublin market sharply higher today, erasing all of the previous day's losses amid fresh 
record highs on Wall Street.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 75.41 points higher on 8456.84.
US stocks leapt higher on Wall Street in early trading, with weaker oil prices and upbeat earnings news combining 
to push the Dow to all-time highs and within sight of the 12,000 mark.
 AIB was the day's star performer in Dublin, jumping 53c to 21.35, while Bank of Ireland tacked on 8c to 15.50. The 
strong trading spread right through the financial sector with Anglo Irish Bank closing 20c higher on 13.72 and Irish 
Life and Permanent up 7c to 19.56. Construction shares turned in a fairly lacklustre performance with CRH slipping 
16c to 27.25 and Kingspan down 26c to 16.46. McInerney managed to buck the trend, closing marginally higher, up 
7c to 13.27, while shares in Grafton were up 6c to 11.19. Large financial institutions continued to buy and sell Aer 
Lingus shares as the hostile attempt by Ryanair to acquire a controlling interest in the recently floated national 
airline goes on. Shares slipped 5c to 2.90 today with over one million shares changing hands. Shares in Ryanair 
were unchanged on 8.50. A report from NCB Stockbrokers said that Ryanair could afford to pay over E4 a share for 
Aer Lingus from its own resources. NCB analyst John Sheehan said a full takeover of the national carrier by 
Ryanair could generate significant annual cost savings without cutting Aer Lingus's staff numbers. He added that 
Aer Lingus's cost base as a percentage of overall revenues was 91.9pc compared to 80.8pc at Ryanair. He said 
saving could be made on aircraft maintenance (77pc higher than at Ryanair despite a smaller fleet), marketing and 
airport changes. NCB says annual cost saving of E50 million could be achieved with reducing payroll costs. 
Sheehan said if the E50m cost savings were achieved Ryanair could pay E3.48 per Aer Lingus share and add 9.8 
cents to its earning per share (EPS). If the bid was increased to E4.02 per share, Ryanair could still add 8 cents to 
its EPS. At E4.22 per share, Ryanair's earnings would be 7.3 cents higher, he said. Shares in South Wharf bounced 
back after the firm last week reported pre-tax losses of E1.3m for the first half of this year. The loss marked a 60pc

increase on that of the same period last year, despite an increase in turnover to almost E530,000 from E230,000. 
Shares were up over 12pc, or 90c, today to 8.00. Shares in drinks and snacks group C and C slipped 22c to 11.21 
despite the group posting strong first half profits, while Waterford Wedgewood was a notable mover, climbing 12pc, 
or 1c, to 0.05, after it said that its first-half operating loss has 'reduced substantially' and it has improved margins. 
Other notable movers included Donegal Creameries, which slipped 30c to 4.30, while FBD Holdings climbed 8c to 
39.48 and Kerry Group tacked on 21c to 18.56. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was in the red, slipping 4c to

Body
Stake-building is fast becoming a routine tactic in takeovers. Osprey, an international consortium, on Monday raised 
its holding in AWG to 22 per cent despite having won a recommendation for its bid for the UK water utility days 
before. Ryanair last week bought 16 per cent of Aer Lingus before mounting a bid. Earlier this year, BNP Paribas 
secured 48 per cent of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro before launching an offer.
The tactic comes into its own in contested cash offers. Its popularity partly stems from the proliferation of cash 
bidders, fuelled by cheap debt, chasing a smaller number of targets. In the UK, the removal of caps on the amount 
of a company's stock that can be bought in a single day may also be a factor.
But stake-building has also become easier, thanks to the shortening time horizons of investors. Many institutions 
sell out when a company comes into play. Fickle hedge funds take their place. This revolution in bid dynamics is 
unlikely to be undone even when deal activity tails off.
The concern is that stake-building deters rival bidders. Selling shareholders may deprive more patient investors of a 
higher offer in an auction. For example, a private equity consortium was prepared to pay more for BAA than 
Ferrovial, which saw off its rival by buying 14 per cent of the target in the market.
Such worries are understandable but should not be overdone. There is an important principle that shareholders 
have the right to take cash up front from a bidder, rather than wait months for a deal to close. And mere talk of a 
counterbid prompted Osprey to raise its AWG bid even though it was already stake-building.
The real lesson is that now that stake-building has become easier, companies will have to fight even harder to 
retain their independence.

Pilots for Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC have bought up almost €30 million (US$37.7 million) worth of the 
carrier's shares, raising speculation that those opposed to a takeover bid by low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC 
are shoring up a blocking stake.
A notice to the Irish Stock Exchange on Wednesday confirmed that the Irish Airline Pilots Pension group has bought 
almost 10 million shares at €3.04 (US$3.81) each, building a 2.12 stake in the airline.
Ryanair's surprise €1.48 billion (US$1.86 billion) offer for Aer Lingus last week was rejected by the company, the 
Irish government and Aer Lingus employees. Analysts said the pilots' move spelled potential trouble for Ryanair 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
The pilots' association declined to comment on the stock purchase, but analysts said the move could be part of a 
creeping equity grab designed to block Ryanair's takeover.
Ryanair's bid is conditional on gaining 50.1 percent of Aer Lingus. It currently holds 19.2 percent after buying up 
shares last week.
The government, which sold most of its holding in the previously state-owned carrier to give it the freedom to grow, 
still holds a 28 percent stake in the carrier. It has pledged to retain a minimum 25.1 percent stake the minimum 
required to block any attempt by a majority owner to have the company de-listed from stock markets.
The current government stake, combined with the pilots' holdings and the 12 percent owned by employee share 
ownership trusts, gives government and staff just over 42 percent of the carrier.
Dresdner Kleinwort analyst Mike Powell said that Ryanair now faces a battle.

"It's up against entrenched interests with over 40 percent of Aer Lingus stock government, employees, unions, 
including some resistance among their own shareholders," said Powell. "I know some investors who have 
completely sold their Ryanair stake. Strategically, Ryanair's bid is a disaster."
Analysts said that Ryanair was unlikely to succeed without raising its offer price. They believe the carrier, which has 
rapidly expanded across Europe but never mounted such an ambitious takeover bid before, certainly could afford to

Aer Lingus shares were well above Ryanair's offer price of €2.80 (US$3.51) at €2.95 (US$3.70), up 1.7 percent, on 
Wednesday. Ryanair shares fell 1.3 percent to €8.52 (US$10.69).
Opponents to the takeover claim it will wipe out competition, drive up prices and lead to job cuts. Union leaders are 
also concerned that Ryanair does not recognize union rights, insisting instead of individual staff contracts.

Body
A group of Aer Lingus pilots yesterday moved to block a takeover bid from Ryanair by buying approximately E24m 
worth of shares in the airline.
The pilots bought the shares yesterday afternoon at a price of E3.05 in a transaction managed by Goodbody 
Stockbrokers, which are advising the airline, The Irish Times reports.
The purchase of 8.5 million shares is expected to be formally declared to the stock market later today.
 Yesterday's transaction will give the group a 1.6pc share of the airline's equity. Analysts said it was a defensive 
move against Ryanair, which last Thursday launched a E1.4bn, or E2.80 per share, bid for Aer Lingus. Ryanair 
currently holds a 19.2pc stake in the airline and wants to buy at least 50pc. The pilots and other opponents believe 
that they can veto any bid from Ryanair by buying up as many shares as possible. Meanwhile, the newspaper also 
reports that Aer Lingus's plans to fly to additional US cities suffered a set-back yesterday when US officials said a 
draft aviation deal agreed with the Government was unlikely to be honoured without an EU-wide "open skies" 
agreement. A US official in Brussels said the administration's clear preference was to have a full "open skies" 
agreement come into force with all EU member states.

In the brief period since the Ryanair Euros 1.48bn cash bid for Aer Lingus took off, it has already provided plenty of 
in-flight entertainment. The prospect of the famously rude low-cost airline imposing its culture on the newly 
privatised Irish national carrier is one for outsiders to relish. There is also onlooker appeal in the idea that ifRyanair 
failed in a takeover its current stake would still enable it to be a thorn in Aer Lingus' side as an investor. Equally, if 
Ryanair was successful the Irish government could be an irritant minority shareholder in the combined group. But 
beyond the political and corporate fireworks lie serious competition concerns.
The scale of the proposed deal makes it likely that it will fall to competition authorities in Brussels rather than 
Dublin. The combined entity would control more than 70 per cent of the UK/Ireland market, with attention rightly 
focusing on the all-important Dublin-London route. The key point here is whether the regulator looks at the market 
on a city-to-city basis or airport-to-airport.
An airport-to-airport basis would split the route into five markets with relatively little overlap: Aer Lingus is not 
present in London Stansted, for example, while Ryanair is absent from Heathrow. But looking at individual airports 
would be misguided. London is not a destination served by just one airport at the heart of a city and another so far 
outside it that only the most generous geographical interpretation - as sometimes used by Ryanair itself on other 
routes - would put them both in the same location.
Whatever the differences between the London airports, these are not as striking as the similarities. The relative 
distances of the airports from the city centre may play a part in some travel decisions, but are for many people 
much less important than fares or the convenience of flight times. Moreover, there is an intrinsic difficulty in trying to 
distinguish between Heathrow and Gatwick as international hubs. At the Irish end of the route the problem is that of 
a single airport. A jointRyanair/Aer Lingus would have a stranglehold on Dublin airport.
Forbidding the deal would not be the only way to prevent such undesirable dominance. But the alternative remedy - 
forcing the group to give up enough slots to slacken its grip - might well undermine whatever commercial rationale 
exists for the takeover. Development plans for a second Dublinterminal make the issue particularly delicate. Ryanair 
currently favours a no-frills structure but Aer Lingus is seeking a more elaborate building that would boost its long-
haul business.
A turbulent takeover Air regulators should see Dublin-London route as one market
The impact on Dublin is so critical that Brussels should give special consideration to any request from the national 
regulator for this element of the deal to be referred back. If, that is, the Irish competition authorities are feeling brave 
enough to ask.

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, yesterday intensified the already fierce battle that is being waged in the Spanish 
aviation market by announcing the launch of an operating base in Madrid.
Spain has become the main focus for the expansion of low-cost carriers in Europe after the UK and Germany, and 
the move by Ryanair came only weeks after EasyJet, its UK rival, announced its own plans for a Madrid base.
Ryanair announced aninitial network of 14 routes to and from Madrid, including Dublin, Paris-Beauvais, Brussels-
Charleroi, Gothenburg, Marseille and Eindhoven as well as Nottingham East Midlands and Bournemouth in the UK.
Initially, at least, it is avoiding head-to-head competition with EasyJet.
It said it would base three aircraft in the Spanishcapital, which will become its 18th base in Europe. It planned to 
carry 1mpassengers a year on the Madrid routes, which would begin operations in late November.
The airlines are expanding in Madrid to take advantage of the big increase of capacity at Barajas airport, which has 
doubled the number of runways from two to four and has opened a fourthterminal.
The launch of a base in Madrid will open a second front for Ryanair, which is already expanding fast from its first 
Spanish base atBarcelona-Gerona.
Two weeks ago it said that it was doubling the number of aircraft based in Gerona from four to eight in March next 
year and would add 17 more routes taking the network to 40 destinations.
Passenger numbers to and from Gerona were forecast to rise to 4m a year with its total Spanish network rising to 
9m passengers a year, including the new Madrid base.

Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, its rival Irish airline, hitfurther resistance yesterday when pilots in the former state-
owned carrier boughta 2 per cent stake thatcould help to block the Euros 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) takeoveroffer.
A pension fund connected with the Aer Lingus pilots acquired a block of 8.5m shares at a Euros 3.05.
The shares closed yesterday at Euros 2.87 compared with the Ryanair offer price of Euros 2.80.
Ryanair owns about 20 per cent of Aer Lingus, the bulk of which was acquired before official trading started 
following the initial public offering two weeks ago when the Irish government reduced its 85 per cent stake.
Ryanair is restricted from buying more shares as the price is now above its offer price.
Brokers said that, if the share price remained at the higher levels, Ryanair would have to raise its price to have any 
chance of persuading shareholders to accept its offer.
The government now holds a 28 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and an employee shares ownership trust owns 9.6 
per cent.
Separately, two approved employee profit-sharing schemes own just under 2 per cent. Together with the pilots' 
stake this adds upto a potential blockingstake of more than 40 per cent.
There was no evidence these parties would actin unison "but you canbe certain they won't be talking to the big 
badwolf, Ryanair", said one broker.
The government is preparing to argue that the deal is bad for competition and the consumer.
Aer Lingus has enlisted Mario Monti and Karel van Miert, two former European Union competition commissioners, 
said to be "actively involved" making the case on Aer Lingus's behalfin Brussels.

Both are consultants to Goldman Sachs, advisers to Aer Lingus.
Meanwhile, Ryanair dismissed as a distraction a move by Impact, the union representing pilots andcabin crew, to 
lodge a pay claim with the labourrelations commission on behalf of pilots at Ryanair,a non-unionised work-force.
Impact argued that, if Ryanair was to take over Aer Lingus, the pilots should have the same pay and conditions.
Impact put their proposal to Ryanair a month ago and it was rejected.
Ryanair said: "This is the first of many feeble attempts by Impact to distract from Ryanair's generous offer for Aer 
Lingus, which, if it proceeds, will lead to lower costs and lower fares for Aer Lingus customers."

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said it is opening up 14 European routes into and out of Madrid as it 
invests euro168 million ($210 million) to create a new travel hub in Spain.
The Irish carrier hopes to carry a million passengers in its first year of operations out of Madrid's Barajas airport, a 
plan for which it is buying three Boeing 737-800 jetliners, Ryanair CEO Michael Cawley said in a news release 
Tuesday.
Cawley added that the new base would create 1,000 jobs.
Among the 14 new routes are daily flights from Madrid to Paris, Dublin, Ireland, and Marseille, France. The Dublin-
based carrier said it will also offer flights from Madrid to a range of cities, including Brussels and Oslo, four times a 
week.
Ryanair has operated routes to and from Spain since 2003, with a base in the northeastern city of Gerona.
