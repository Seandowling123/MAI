December 23rd, 2023 ( Activist Post  — Delivered by  Newstex )
By Chris Burt
Biometrics in support of reusable digital ID is a theme running through several of the news articles that drew the 
most viewers over the past week on Biometric Update. Worldcoin is cleared for a return to operations in Kenya, BT 
is planning UK government certification for its digital ID, and a webinar examined SpruceID's work on California's 
mDL. In a slightly different vein, a new partnership between Tech5 and Visa will work on delivering cash transfers 
from government to people digitally. Each involves contactless biometrics, mostly face. Face biometrics also feature 
in popular stories about Google's new age estimation service, Thales' ambitions in Indonesia's smart capital city 
project, and emerging startup VNPay.
Top biometrics news of the week
Worldcoin has negotiated a return to operations  in Kenya, resuming biometric ID verifications after a pause of 
several months to address the data privacy and other concerns of local regulators. Co-founder Alex Blania also 
explained the addition of face biometrics and a third level of assurance for World ID in a recent interview.
The EU appears to have set a new launch date for its biometric Entry/Exit System, which would avoid the potential 
hassles of introducing a new ID check process until after the Paris Olympics . October 6, 2024 is the target launch 
date. Ryanair is already complaining that the system is poorly managed, and Eurotunnel, which announced the new 
date, estimates that additional biometric checks will significantly increase processing times.
Canadian lawmakers have advanced a bill that would mandate age checks for online pornography  to the 
committee stage. The bill does not specify the method of age assurance, which could be based on digital ID, 
identity document and selfie uploads, or facial age estimation. MPs voting against it say a broader set of online 
harms, such as gambling and violent content, should be subject to age verification.
Google has developed facial age estimation  technology which is now approved by the UK's Age Check 
Certification Scheme. The company has achieved EAL3 for age estimation and EAL1 for biometric presentation 
attack detection, though it has not officially launched the service or made clear its market plans.
Face Biometrics Taking Over Authentication and Age Assurance
A growing trend of the UK's biggest businesses providing their own digital identity products continues with 
discussions between BT and the government on recognition for its EE ID app . The digital ID is secured with face 
and fingerprint biometrics, and BT is planning for it to become certified under the DIATF. Yoti CEO Robin Tombs 
weighs in on the UK's maturing market.

Officials with the California government and SpruceID  discussed how the state turned to the open-source digital 
credentialing provider to build its digital wallet and mobile driver's license in a GovTech webinar last week. They 
discussed the motivation to build a decentralized system and avoid vendor lock-in for the mDL, which uses iProov 
biometrics.
Tech5 formed a strategic partnership with Visa to work on digital identity, payments and other aspects of digital 
government ecosystems. Visa will integrate Tech5 's SSI-based identity wallet and contactless biometric 
technologies, with digitized payments to people from governments among the goals of the collaboration.
Thales has signed an MoU to work with Indonesia's government as the country constructs its planned future capital 
city, Nusantara. Thales believes the project could present contract opportunities worth as much as $300 million for 
smart city technology , which often includes facial recognition.
A widely-cited statistic from America's National Retail Federation that nearly half of the $94.5 billion in retail theft in 
the country in 2021 was attributable to organized retail crime disappeared from the group's report earlier this month. 
The figure for total theft by the shoplifting mafia, it seems, was drawn from congressional testimony later admitted to 
be mistaken. As the Los Angeles Times  points out, this figure has been used to support arguments about the 
necessity of facial recognition in stores that now merit reconsideration.
Sri Lanka is determined relaunch a tender  for the contract to print its digital ID cards by the end of 2023. The 
government has also been preparing to enroll people for the digital ID, raising the fee registered photographers can 
charge for taking face photos to ICAO standards.
Digital payments startup VNPay has passed iBeta PAD testing  and received ISO/IEC 27001 certification, as it 
positions itself to compete in the selfie KYC market. The company is a subsidiary of Vietnam-based VNLife, and 
briefly reached a $1 billion dollar valuation in 2021.
Burger King Brasil has teamed up with ad agency DM9 to turn facial recognition technology to the task of hangover 
analysis, The Drum  reports. The ' Hangover Whopper ' marketing campaign promises customers a discount on the 
purchase best suited to counteract the effects of their holiday indulgences.

EU Court Sides with Ryanair in Case Against Air France 's Covid Bailout
EU Court Sides with Ryanair in Case Against Air France's Covid Bailout

The European General Court has ruled in favor of Ryanair in a significant legal battle over state aid granted to Air 
France during the Covid-19 pandemic. The court annulled the European Commission's decisions from 2020 and 
2021 that approved French state aid for Air France, citing concerns that the Air France-KLM group, including KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines, unfairly benefited over competitors.
This case is part of a series of legal challenges initiated by Ryanair and its subsidiary Malta Air against pandemic-
related state aid provided to airlines by EU member states. The aid, often directed at flag carriers, was criticized for 
disadvantaging low-cost carriers like Ryanair.
In its December 20 judgment, the Luxembourg-based court stated that the European Commission failed to properly 
define the aid's beneficiaries, erroneously excluding the Air France-KLM holding and KLM. The court emphasized 
the necessity for the Commission to exercise vigilance in assessing the connections between companies within a 
group receiving state aid.
The ruling stems from a EUR 7 billion aid package announced by France for Air France in April 2020, where the 
European Commission initially declared Air France as the sole beneficiary. A subsequent EUR 4 billion 
recapitalization in March 2021, excluding KLM, was also quickly approved by the Commission. Ryanair and Malta 
Air contested these decisions, arguing they were contrary to EU law and incorrectly defined the beneficiaries of the 
aid.
The court's decision opens the possibility for an appeal within two months and ten days. Following the ruling, Air 
France stated that it complied with state aid exit regulations and is considering an appeal to the Court of Justice of 
the European Union.
Ryanair hailed the court's decision as a victory for fair competition and consumers across the EU. The airline urged 
the European Commission to demand immediate recovery of the illegal state aid from Air France-KLM and to 
implement measures to mitigate the impact of the bailout on market competition.
This ruling represents a significant development in the ongoing debate over state aid to airlines during the 
pandemic, underscoring the complexities of ensuring fair competition in the aviation sector.

21 December 2023
RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC - INTERIM DIVIDEND FOR FY24
Dividend Information
Ryanair Holdings plc is pleased to announce that the FY24 interim dividend of (EURO)0.175 per ordinary share will 
be payable to shareholders on the register of members at close of business on 19 January, 2024. The dividend will 
be paid on 28 February, 2024.
Dividends Payments
Dividends will be paid in euro to all shareholders. Shareholders holding their shares via the central securities 
depository operated by Euroclear Bank or via CREST will receive dividends electronically via such systems.
However, in order to avoid inconvenience to overseas certificated shareholders when negotiating euro cheques, the 
Company has arranged that its registrar, Link Registrars Limited (the "Registrar"), will provide an International 
Payments Service ("IPS"), whereby dividends can be paid to those shareholders in their local currency. If 
shareholders wish to have their dividend paid in a currency other than Euro then they must complete an IPS 
mandate 
which 
can 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
registrar 
and 
will 
be 
available 
on 
their 
website 
https://www.linkgroup.eu/get-in-touch/shareholders-in-irish-companies/. This election form must be completed and 
received by Link Registrars Limited, PO Box 7117, Dublin 2, Ireland (By Post) or to Link Registrars Limited, Suite 
149, The Capel Building, Mary's Abbey, Dublin 7, D07 DP79, Ireland (by hand during normal business hours) by 
close of business on 26 January, 2024.
RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC - INTERIM DIVIDEND FOR FY24
For certificated shareholders, dividends will be paid by cheque and will be sent by ordinary post on 27 February, 
2024. Alternatively, if you are in the Single Euro Payments Area ("SEPA") you can update your bank details on the 
Registrar's share portal www.signalshares.com. You will need your Investor Code ("IVC") to register on the portal 
and this can be found on your share certificate.
Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) currently deducted at a rate of 25%, must be deducted from dividends paid by an 
Irish resident company, unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed 
exemption form to the Registrar. Non-resident shareholders and certain Irish companies, trusts, pension schemes, 
investment undertakings and charities may be entitled to claim exemption from DWT. Copies of the form may be 
obtained online from the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Shareholders should note that DWT will be deducted from 
dividends in cases where a properly completed form has not been received by the market deadline date for a 
dividend, which is Friday, 26 January 2024 in this case. Individuals who are resident in Ireland for tax purposes are 
not entitled to an exemption. If shares are held via Euroclear Bank or via CREST, the owners of the shares will 
need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held to ascertain their arrangements and cut-off 
times for tax relief for eligible investors to be applied at source.

Biggest aviation deals of 2023
Biggest aviation deals of 2023

Highlight: A breakdown of some of the biggest deal in the aviation industry throughout 2023.
Body
From record aircraft orders to landmark mergers and significant investment into the use of sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF), the aviation industry has received billions of dollars of investment this year as it continues to recover from 
the damage of the pandemic shutdowns.  Now, as the year comes to a close, Airport Technology is taking a look 
back at some of the biggest and most impactful deals to take place in the aviation industry across 2023, including 
the largest commercial aircraft order in history and a game-changing acquisition for the US aviation sector.  
Lufthansa goes for minority stake in ITA In a deal that continued evolving throughout the year, Germany's 
Lufthansa first entered its bid to acquire a minority stake in Italian airline ITA Airways at the beginning of the year.  
The agreement saw Lufthansa buy a 41% stake in the company in a deal worth (EURO)325m ($356.8m) which 
includes an option to acquire the remaining shares at a later date.  Air India signs $70bn in aircraft orders with 
Boeing and Airbus Air India further cemented its position as one of the fastest growing airlines in the world with this 
order in February that saw it sign an agreement to acquire 470 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing with two orders 
worth $70bn.  The deal, which was later finalised at the Paris Air Show, was part of the airline's desire to expand on 
both its domestic and international offerings, with a mix of single-aisle and widebody aircraft.  Hawaiian Airlines 
agrees to buy 50m gallons of SAF from Gevo  One of many airlines to sign multi-year agreements on the use of 
SAF in 2023, Hawaiian's deal with in-development biofuel company Gevo was one of the biggest, despite not being 
expected to come into effect until 2029.  The deal will last five years with the supply of 50m gallons of SAF and is 
part of the airline's target of achieving net zero across its operations by 2050, in line with industry standards. The 
airline will remain in the skies in 2024, despite being acquired by fellow West Coast carrier Alaska. 
Ryanair signs its largest ever purchase for 300 aircraft with Boeing The low-budget airline continued its significant 
expansion and modernisation plans with this deal which was the largest in its history, acquiring up to 300 737 MAX 
10 aircraft from Boeing.  The $40bn deal saw Ryanair order 150 of the aircraft, with the option to order 150 more, as 
it sought to replace ageing planes and build on strong post-pandemic travel demands.  Airbus signs seven orders 
during Paris Air Show While both Airbus and Boeing celebrated successful showings at the Paris Air Show, it was 
the French manufacturer that clinched one of the aviation industry's biggest deals ever with Indigo's order for 500 
Biggest aviation deals of 2023
jets, the largest commercial aircraft order in history.  The deals didn't stop there for Airbus either, with the company 
signing and finalising a range of other deals for a variety of aircraft with airlines from around the world.  Boeing 
signs seven orders during Paris Air Show While the previously mentioned order from Air India was Boeing's largest 
at the Paris Air Show, the US manufacturer also welcomed a number of other deals with international airlines and a 
leasing company.  Boeing's total orders from across the air show added up to 356 orders to its backlog with a 
specific focus on its 737 MAX family of aircraft as well as the 787 Dreamliner group of planes.  NetJets signs a 
record order for 1,500 jets over 15 years with Textron The deal featuring the largest amount of aircraft on this list, 
NetJets 15 year agreement with manufacturer Textron Aviation will see the historic private jet company have the 
option to acquire up to 1,500 Cessna business aircraft.  Beginning in 2025, the order includes NetJets adding new 
Cessna Citation Ascend, Cessna Latitude, and Citation Longitude aircraft to its fleet, adding to the 800 aircraft 
already delivered by Textron over the last eight years.  DHL Express signs seven-year contract for 668m litres of 
SAF with World Energy Another fuel-focused deal, DHL Express' seven-year contract with SAF producer World 
Energy is believed to be the largest and longest of its type in the world.  The agreement will see the supply of 668 
million litres of SAF through the use of SAF certificates as part of the logistics company's efforts to reduce its 
carbon footprint across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.  Ferrovial sells its stake in Heathrow Airport for $3.04bn In one 
of the biggest airport deals in 2023, Ferrovial sold its significant stake in one of the world's busiest airports, 
Heathrow, in two deals worth over $3bn to Saudia Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and French private equity 
group Ardian.  PIF's involvement in the deal was particularly notable due to the Kingdom's wide-ranging efforts to 
expand its presence in the aviation industry, including in the infrastructure of other countries such as the UK.  
Alaska Airlines acquires Hawaiian for $1.9bn While JetBlue's ongoing issues over its acquisition of Spirit Airlines 
was the focus of much attention throughout the year, Alaska Airlines announcement in the final month of 2023 that 
it would look to acquire Hawaiian Airlines could be another game changer for the US aviation industry.  While it is 
expected to face its own scrutiny from the country's Department of Justice, the $1.9bn deal could see Alaska take 
significant control of the aviation market in Hawai'i, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.

Highlight: Low-cost airline Ryanair has won a court case against the EU over its approval of the French 
Government's (EURO)11bn financial aid for Air France and Air France-KLM during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Body
In a joint case with Malta Air, Ryanair said that the approval of the aid in 2020 and 2021 went against EU law by 
claiming that authorities had not considered the impact of the aid on the French flag carrier and other airlines 
involved in the Air-France-KLM group including the Netherlands' KLM.  The EU General Court ruled with Ryanair 
and thus annulled the European Commission's decisions on the French state's loan guarantee coverage of 90% of 
a (EURO)4bn loan and a shareholder loan of (EURO)3bn in 2020, and a recapitalisation of Air France and Air 
France-KLM for (EURO)4bn in 2021.  The court said that the Commission had "erred in defining the beneficiaries of 
the state aid granted" by excluding the other airlines and the Air France-KLM holding, despite the court saying that 
links between the companies and the contractual framework meant that the group and KLM "were capable of 
benefiting" from the advantages of the aid.  Ryanair, which has also filed a number of other challenges to state aid 
given during the pandemic, described the ruling as a "triumph for fair competition and consumers" which highlighted 
the Commission's role in ensuring a level playing field.  A Ryanair spokesperson said: "Today's judgments 
underline the need for the European Commission to immediately act to recover these illegal State aid packages and 
order remedies to restore at least some of the damage done to competition.  "Undistorted competition eliminates 
inefficiency and benefits consumers through low fares and choice. 
Unjustified subsidies, on the other hand, encourage ineffectiveness and will harm consumers for decades to 
come."  Meanwhile, Air France and Air France-KLM said they would be looking at the ruling and deciding whether 
to file an appeal, though also highlighting that it had already "fulfilled all exit requirements of all state aid."  In 
addition to its celebration of the ruling, Ryanair also took the opportunity to point to an alleged lack of action 
regarding a previous ruling, where the General Court ruled against decisions on similar state aid given to SAS, 
Lufthansa and airlines in Italy, saying that the Commission had not yet acted to recover the aid.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), Europe's largest budget airline, achieved a significant victory in the EU General 
Court on Wednesday when the court annulled the European Commission's 2020 decision to approve (EURO)7 
billion in French state aid for Air France.
The aid was initially granted to mitigate the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic under a (EURO)40 
billion package.
Ryanair has been actively contesting multiple cases of state aid provided to various airlines across Europe, 
advocating for fair competition in the single market.
The airline has called out Swedish, Danish, German and Italian governments for favouring their local airlines over 
other EU airlines, which Ryanair believes to be a breach of EU law.
A Ryanair spokesperson pulled no punches in a public statement: "The EU Commission's spineless approach to 
state aid since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis allowed member states to write open-ended cheques to their 
inefficient zombie flag carriers in the name of faded national prestige.
"Undistorted competition eliminates inefficiency and benefits consumers through low fares and choice. Unjustified 
subsidies, on the other hand, encourage ineffectiveness and will harm consumers for decades to come."

BRUSSELS (AP) — Low-cost airlines Ryanair and Malta Air won a court case Wednesday against the European 
Union's decision to approve billions of euros in state aid by the French government to Air France and holding 
company Air France-KLM during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ryanair has filed several court challenges against measures introduced by EU countries to help some airlines 
weather the fallout of coronavirus restrictions.
The Irish airline welcomed the decision and urged the European Commission “to order France to immediately 
recover this multi-billion euro illegal state aid package."
The bloc's 27 members must seek approval from the commission — which is the EU's executive branch — when 
granting financial support to companies. Many countries across Europe did so to help keep their airlines afloat 
during the pandemic.
Back in 2020, French authorities notified the European Commission of an aid measure of 7 billion euros ($7.67 
billion), which was supposed to solely benefit Air France, to the exclusion of all the other companies in the Air 
France-KLM group. A year later, France told the commission about plans for 4-billion-euro ($4.38 billion) 
recapitalization of Air France and the holding company.
In both cases, the European Commission didn't raise objections.
But the European General Court ruled that the Air France-KLM holding and KLM “were capable of benefiting, at 
least indirectly, from the advantage granted by the state aid at issue" and annulled the European Commission’s 
decisions.
“Where there are grounds to fear the effects on competition of an accumulation of state aid within the same group, 
the onus is on the Commission to exercise particular vigilance in examining the links between the companies 
belonging to that group,” the court said.
EU court annuls approval of French pandemic aid to Air France and Air France - KLM
Air France-KLM and Air France said they will consider whether to lodge an appeal before the Court of Justice of the 
EU.
“In parallel, they will contribute to any exchange between the French State and the European Commission with a 
view to the adoption of possible new approval decisions,” the companies said.
The European Commission is also the EU’s anti-trust watchdog. As pandemic restrictions in 2020 brought travel to 
a halt and threatened the existence of airlines, the commission eased its policies, approving billions of euros in 
support for national flag carriers.
Under a fast-track system set up during what the commission described as “an unprecedented crisis,” Brussels 
approved around 3 trillion euros in state support across all sectors in member nations. Ryanair believes that 40 
billion euros was granted to Europe’s airline sector alone.
The EU General Court had previously ruled in other cases that the European Commission had been wrong to 
approve massive bailouts designed to help German flag-carrier Lufthansa and Scandinavian airline SAS deal with 
the impact of the pandemic restrictions. It also annulled approval of $140 million of COVID-19 aid for Italian airlines.
 “The European Commission’s Directorate General for Competition has still not acted to force recovery of the 
unlawful aid, nor has it imposed any measures to remedy the damage to competition caused by the Swedish, 
Danish, German, and Italian governments favoring their local airlines over other EU airlines, in breach of EU law," 
Ryanair said. “Today’s judgments underline the need for the European Commission to immediately act to recover 
these illegal state aid packages and order remedies to restore at least some of the damage done to competition.”

December 20th, 2023 ( International Business Times News  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A top EU court annulled on Wednesday the approval of a pandemic state aid programme for Air France-KLM that 
had been challenged by Irish rival Ryanair and Malta Air.
The General Court ruled that the European Commission "erred" in approving the French government's financial aid 
for Air France-KLM.
The group received billions of euros (dollars) from the state after the pandemic grounded the aviation sector in 2020 
-- money that has since been reimbursed, with interest.
The court noted that Ryanair and Malta Air had argued that the measures were "contrary to EU law".
The two airlines said the commission had "incorrectly defined the beneficiaries" by deciding that neither the group's 
holding company nor Dutch airline KLM were recipients of that aid.
Ryanair on Wednesday called the ruling "a triumph for fair competition and consumers across the EU."
The General Court previously sided with Ryanair in May in a case against massive government bailouts for German 
airline Lufthansa and Scandinavia's SAS during the pandemic.
"Today's judgments underline the need for the European Commission to immediately act to recover these illegal 
State aid packages and order remedies to restore at least some of the damage done to competition," it added.
Air France-KLM said it took note of the ruling.
"Air France-KLM and Air France will carefully study these judgments and assess their implications," the group said 
in a statement.
"They will consider whether to lodge an appeal on points of law before the Court of Justice of the European Union," 
the statement said.

FOR AVID racing fans, Christmas Day is not the main event, that comes 24 hours later on Boxing Day with the 
feature race of the Christmas period, and second most important jumps race in the calendar, the King George 
(2.30pm).
Kempton Park will be packed to the rafters for the festive spectacle and, looking at the fields at this stage, it's set to 
be a post-Christmas cracker.
The ante-post market is headed by Allaho after Willie Mullins confirmed the four-time Grade One winner would line 
up in the £250,000 contest and, with support building behind him in the market, he's likely to go off at short odds.
Since winning the 2022 Ryanair and then destroying his rivals in the Punchestown Gold Cup a month later,
Allaho has only been seen once, when making a winning reappearance at Clonmel in November.
He didn't have much to beat last time and there has to be a concern that after 561 days off the track prior to that, 
the bounce factor could come into play.
At his current odds of 7/4 I'm keen to steer clear.
Last year's winner Bravemansgame must be respected, especially as his trainer Paul Nicholls has won this race an 
unprecedented 13 times.
Prepare for a Royale rumble on Boxing Day Bill Esdaile looks ahead to the best of the Christmas racing
Kempton clearly suits him, as a sharp track where he can make best use of his accurate jumping, but it's 
disappointing that he has been beaten twice at odds-on already this season.
Shishkin looks a big price for a horse of his ability, but he hasn't had an ideal preparation and who knows if he'll 
consent to race this time.
At this stage, I'm always hunting for a bit of value and ROYALE PAGAILLE could just be it.
Venetia Williams has her team in red-hot form at the moment, and after winning the Betfair Chase at Haydock last 
month her nine-year-old is sure to be ready for this test.
He finished second behind Bravemansgame in this race last year, but beat that rival comprehensively at Haydock 
last time, so I think there's plenty of juice in his price of around 10/1.
One thing he could do with is a bit more give in the ground, as he relishes testing conditions, so if there's some rain 
around before Boxing Day, expect his price to shorten considerably.
The big races come thick and fast after Christmas and next stop is the Welsh Grand National (2.50pm) on 
December 27.
This is always one of the most gruelling races in the calendar, run over 3m6½f at Chepstow and often in heavy 
ground, so having bags of stamina is essential.
Monbeg Genius is the obvious one here and will love conditions, but from a value perspective I'd rather look 
elsewhere.
NASSALAM won the trial for this race impressively at the beginning of the month, when seemingly relishing the step 
up in trip and testing conditions.
That was over just shy of three miles, so while there has to be a question about him staying this marathon trip, he is 
still unexposed as a stayer, and this could yet be his game.
I'm willing to chance him each-way at around 10/1.
Chasing Nassalam home last time was WAYFINDER, and this race looks to have always been the target for 
Rebecca Curtis' runner.
This nine-year-old loves it at Chepstow, with four of his six career wins coming at the Welsh venue, he'll stay the 
trip and will relish the likely ground, so he looks a massive price at 50/1.

 Care to share? 
The European Union's General Court of Justice has annulled the French state aid package provided to Air France 
in 2020 and 2021. In a complaint filed by Ryanair and its subsidiary Malta Air, theGeneral Court said on 
Wednesday[1] that it can't be ruled out that not just Air France, but also KLM and the holding Air France-KLM have 
benefitted from the French aid under the EU Temporary Framework. The European Commission can appeal today's 
ruling. 
 In April 2020, weeks after the first wave of Covid paralyzed the airline industry, the French government announced 
that it would guarantee 90 percent of a (EURO)4.0 billion loan that was provided by a consortium of banks, plus 
(EURO)3.0 billion as a shareholder loan. At the time, the French State owned 14.3 percent of Air France. The 
package was approved by the European Commission in May, as it qualified for the Temporary Framework for state 
aid measures to support companies during the pandemic.

Dec 20, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) scaled a 52-week high of $133.34 in the trading session on Dec 19, 2023, 
before closing a tad lower at $133.09. 
The company's shares have gained 78% year to date, significantly higher than 14.9% growth of the industry[1] it 
belongs to. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Let's find out the factors supporting the uptick. 
Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic from the 
pandemic lows. Ryanair's second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023) revenues of $5,361.3 million beat the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,137.7 million. Revenues improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger 
volumes. 
An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. Traffic grew 11% to 105.4 million 
during the first half of fiscal 2024. Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. On the back of 
the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax grew 59% year over year during the first half of fiscal 2024. 
The load factor increased to 95% in the first half of fiscal 2024 from 92% in the year-ago reported quarter. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair recently reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more passengers 
flew than a year ago. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 
2023. The reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 
2023. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in air-travel demand are encouraging. RYAAY's 
total fleet included 536 aircraft as of Sep 30, 2023. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[2] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[3] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[4]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.43% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving the Stock?
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 26.1% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 38.9% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 209.7% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

Dec 19, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The record-breaking traffic during the Thanksgiving period has provided a much-needed boost to the airline stocks 
in the sector after a few tough months due to headwinds like high labor and fuel costs and a slowdown in domestic 
air travel demand. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand for domestic as well as international 
flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk 
of most airlines' top lines. 
Impressive air traffic has led to a 15.6% appreciation in the Zacks Airline[1] industry so far this year. This northward 
movement compares favorably with the 11.6% rise recorded by the broader Zacks Transportation[2] sector in the 
same time frame. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic,Copa Holdings(CPA),Azul S.A.(AZUL) andRyanair 
Holdings(RYAAY) reported impressive traffic numbers for November. CPA, AZUL and RYAAY carry a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' November traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in November on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In 
November, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 11.9% year over year. Revenue passenger miles 
increased 12.4%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by 
passengers) improved to 87.4% from 87.1% in November 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul also reported year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for November 2023. AZUL's 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, 
on a year-over-year basis. The load factor came in at 79.2% in November 2023. 
On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year 
over year, respectively. The load factor came in at 78.2% in November 2023. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.6% and 33.9%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 82.5% from 79.7% in November 2022. 
Ryanair, a European carrier, also reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. 
The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more 
passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was similar in 
Airlines Post Impressive November Traffic Numbers: An Analysis
the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 960 flights 
got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict.

Boeing ( BA ) Wins Deal to Deliver 40 737 MAX Jets to Avolon
Boeing (BA) Wins Deal to Deliver 40 737 MAX Jets to Avolon

Dec 19, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Boeing Company BA[1] recently received a commitment from aviation finance company Avolon for delivering 
40 of its 737-8 jets. This order remains subject to approval from Avolon's primary shareholders. 
The order, once delivered, will boost Boeing's revenues for its commercial airplane business segment, which 
recorded a solid 25% year-over-year revenue improvement in the third quarter of 2023. 737 MAX, A Solid Revenue 
Earner The 737 MAX caters to the single-aisle market with enhanced efficiency, improved environmental 
performance and increased passenger comfort. In particular, Boeing's 737-8 MAX reduces fuel use and emissions 
by 20% while producing a 50% smaller noise footprint than the airplanes it replaces. The jets also offer increased 
comfort and relaxation for passengers, with modern technologies, greater space and larger pivoting overhead 
storage bins. 
Such remarkable features must have bolstered demand for this jet family over the past few years. The latest order 
for 40 737-8 jets is a bright example of that. 
Notably, Dublin-based Avolon has been a much-valued customer for Boeing's 737 program. It ordered 40 737-8 jets 
in June and, with the latest agreement, has fulfilled its commitment to purchase 80 new airplanes this year. 
Prospects in Commercial Aviation Market With the woes of the pandemic behind us and economies across the 
globe witnessing growth once again, the demand for air travel can be expected to continue to rise in the near future. 
To this end, per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the Commercial Aviation market size is expected to go 
from $218.97 billion in 2023 to $271.96 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 4.43%. 
Such solid market growth prospects should aid Boeing, one of the biggest jet manufacturers in the world. 
Impressively, during third-quarter 2023, Boeing secured 398 net orders for commercial jets, including 150 737 MAX 
10 airplanes for Ryanair, 50 787 airplanes for United Airlines and 39 787 airplanes for Saudi Arabian Airlines. The 
company delivered 105 airplanes and the backlog amounted to $392 billion. Such developments, along with the 
company's latest agreement with Avolon, should increase Boeing's profitability in the coming days. Opportunities for 
Peers Apart from Boeing, aircraft manufacturers in the commercial aviation industry that may gain from the 
flourishing market prospects are as follows: 
Embraer ERJ[2]: The company has a huge portfolio of commercial jets. During third-quarter 2023, Embraer's E195-
E2 jet, the largest in the E-Jet family, received Type Certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. On 
Nov 29, 2023, Embraer received an order for 25 E195-E2 passenger jets from Porter Airlines. 
Boeing ( BA ) Wins Deal to Deliver 40 737 MAX Jets to Avolon
ERJ boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an 
improvement of 21.3% from the 2022 reported figure. 
Airbus EADSY[3]: In the first nine months of 2023, Airbus delivered 488 commercial aircraft comprising 41 A220, 
391 A320 Family, 20 A330 and 36 A350. In December 2023, Airbus received multiple orders - four A330-900 from 
Azul Linhas Aereas, 150 A321s and 70 A350 from Turkish Airlines, 100 A321neo from Avolon and A350F from 
Cathay Group.  
EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies 
an improvement of 12.9% from the 2022 reported figure. 
Textron TXT[4]: Its Textron Aviation business segment's principal market includes general aviation aircraft, 
business jets and commercial transportation. In October 2023, the company announced its agreement with Hahn 
Air, which is set to become the European launch customer for TXT's Cessna Citation CJ3 Gen2. The aircraft is 
expected to be delivered in 2026. 
TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an 
improvement of 6.4% from the 2022 reported figure. Price Performance In the past year, shares of BA have rallied 
38.2% against the industry[5]'s 7.7% decline.

Ryanair boss eyeing (EURO)100 million bonus

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) boss Michael O'Leary is nearing an eye watering (EURO)100 million (£86 million) 
bonus.
The bonus itself would mark the largest in European corporate history and comes after Ryanair has benefitted from 
a rebound in travel demand following the pandemic.
Should shares in the budget carrier hit and remain above (EURO)21 for 28 days, O'Leary would receive the reward 
through share options.
These would allow him the right to buy 10 million Ryanair shares at (EURO)11.12 each, effectively leaving O'Leary 
with an instant paper profit of (EURO)98.8 million.
Ryanair closed Friday at (EURO)18.84 per share, having beaten a previous record high set in late 2017 during last 
week's final day of trading on the Euronext Dublin.
He could also be granted the bonus if Ryanair records a (EURO)2.2 billion post-tax profit for the full year, the 
Financial Times first reported, as agreed in 2019.
Post-tax profit between (EURO)1.85 billion and (EURO)2.05 billion is being targeted by Ryanair for its financial year 
to March meanwhile, marking as much as a 43% increase on 2022's (EURO)1.43 billion.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is on track to earn a (EURO)100mn bonus after the low-cost airline's shares hit a 
record high last week.
Shares rose to (EURO)18.99 on Friday, bringing their gains for the year to more than 50 per cent and underlining 
Ryanair's position as by far the most valuable airline in Europe.
Under a bonus scheme agreed in 2019, O'Leary can earn share options worth around (EURO)100mn if the airline's 
share price hits (EURO)21 for 28 days, or it reports (EURO)2.2bn in annual profits after tax.
The payout would be one of the biggest in corporate European history and would see O'Leary granted the options 
to buy 10mn shares at (EURO)11.12 each.
Financial analysts covering Ryanair have an average share price target of (EURO)24 over the next 12 months, 
according to Bloomberg, while the airline has forecast profit after tax of between (EURO)1.85bn and (EURO)2.05bn 
for the fiscal year to March.
The incentive plan was originally due to run until 2024, but was extended until 2028 in December last year, when 
the shares were below (EURO)13.
Ryanair chief on course to claim (EURO)100mn option reward Low-cost carrier's shares at record high Target 
for O'Leary's bonus within sight
O'Leary was paid (EURO)925,000 in Ryanair's most recent financial year, but also owns 3.9 per cent of the 
company, a stake that has a market value of (EURO)907mn, according to FactSet.
Low-cost rival Wizz Air has also offered its chief executive an eye-catching incentive plan. József Váradi can earn 
£100mn if that airline's share price hits £120. But Wizz's growth has been hit by supply chain issues that have 
grounded part of its fleet and its shares are virtually flat this year at £20.
O'Leary, who became Ryanair CEO in 1994, has masterminded the carrier's breakneck growth as it has morphed 
from a small regional airline into a global aviation powerhouse.
The airline has cemented its position as the undisputed leader in European low-cost aviation after using the 
disruption caused by the pandemic to increase its market share as financially weaker rivals retrenched.
Ryanair is the second most valuable airline in the world by market capitalisation behind Delta Air Lines in the US, 
according to Bloomberg data, and has outlined plans to double passenger numbers over the next decade.
O'Leary told the FT this year that he believed there was room for more growth in Europe, even as some analysts 
questioned whether the market was essentially at maximum capacity.
"As long as we don't do something stupid - which is a daily challenge in this industry - we will continue to wipe the 
floor with every other airline in Europe," he said.
Analysts at Barclays have said Ryanair's growth targets "should be relatively straightforward", but that like all 
airlines the company faced risks from "regulatory intervention, particularly relating to environmental regulation, but 
also consumer protection".
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.

price remains above 21 euros for 28 days or if it posts annual profits after tax of 2.2 billion euros. The airline's stock 
was trading at 18.99 on Dec. 15.
O'Leary would receive the options to buy 10 million shares at 11.12 euros apiece in what would be one of the 
biggest corporate payouts in European history, according to the publication.

RYANAIR's chief executive Michael O'Leary could be in line for a bumper (EURO)100m (£86m) pay packet. This 
comes as the carrier's shares hit record highs this week.
O'Leary will receive share options of around (EURO)100m, one of the largest payouts in corporate Europe's history, 
should the low-cost airline's shares reach (EURO)21 for 28 days, or if it nets (EURO)2.2bn in annual post-tax profit.
Shares reached (EURO)18.99 on Friday and are up over 50 per cent in the year to date, with Ryanair proving one 
of the biggest beneficiaries of this year's post-Covid travel boom.
The company is looking at posttax profits of between (EURO)1.85bn and (EURO)2.05bn for the year ending March, 
a forecast made after it reported record half-year earnings in November and announced a maiden dividend for 
shareholders.
O'Leary agreed last December to widen his contract to 2028, in a deal which extended the company's bonus 
scheme to the same year.
He also holds a 3.9 per cent stake at a market value of (EURO)907m, according to Factset data cited by the 
Financial Times, which first reported the story.

Dec 18, 2023( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, is inching towards a potential (EURO)100m (86m) bonus that would be 
among the largest in European corporate history, after the no-frills airline's shares reached a record high. 
Ryanair's stock price rose to (EURO)18.99 by the end of last week, taking O'Leary closer to a threshold that could 
trigger the enormous payout. 
 Shares in the airline must either reach (EURO)21 and stay there for 28 days, or the company must report annual 
post-tax profit of (EURO)2.2bn, for O'Leary to collect the bonus, which was agreed in 2019. 
 If the stock hits the watermark, O'Leary would be given share options, the right to buy equity at a discounted price, 
according to the Financial Times, which first reported the possible bonus. 
 O'Leary would be able to buy 10m shares at (EURO)11.12 each, meaning he could pick up $210m worth of stock 
for $111.2m, scoring an instant paper profit of (EURO)98.8m. 
 The share price increase required to yield the bonus would mean the Dublin-based airline's value had more than 
doubled since August 2019, taking the company's stock market value to nearly (EURO)24bn. It is already the 
second most valuable airline in the world by stock market capitalisation, behind the US carrier Delta Air Lines. 
 O'Leary, who took over at Ryanair in 1994, has presided over the carrier's meteoric rise to become Europe's 
largest airline. During that time, he has amassed 3.9% of the company, a stake that has a market value of 
(EURO)907m. 
 The prospective new share bonus is the result of an incentive scheme agreed in 2019 that was originally due to 
expire in 2024 but was extended until 2028 in December last year. At that time, the airline's stock price was below 
(EURO)13. 
 Financial analysts predict an average share price target of (EURO)24 of the next 12 months, according to data 
from Bloomberg, which would easily put O'Leary above the threshold to collect the bonus. 
 He is less likely to achieve it by virtue of the company's profits, which Ryanair has predicted will hit (EURO)2.05bn 
at the highest for the year to the end of March, compared with the bonus target of (EURO)2.2bn. 
 Ryanair has been able to cash in on the resurgence of air travel and boom in average fares after the pandemic. It 
has said it plans to double passenger numbers[1] over the next 10 years. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in line for (EURO)100m after shares reach high
 'As long as we don't do something stupid, which is a daily challenge in this industry, we will continue to wipe the 
floor with every other airline in Europe,' O'Leary told the Financial Times earlier this year. 
 The airline said in November that it would hand shareholders regular payouts for the first time after soaring air 
fares put Ryanair on track to make record profits.

Dec 15, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Themes ETFs recently launched a pureplay airlines ETF, namely Themes Airlines ETF (AIRL). The resurgence of 
consumer demand post-pandemic has encouraged the issuer to launch the fund. Let's delve a little deeper. Inside 
AIRL The Themes Airlines ETF (AIRL) looks to track the Solactive Airlines Index, which identifies the largest 30 
airline companies by market capitalization. The fund AIRL seeks to provide investment results that correspond 
generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the SOLAIRN Index. 
The 31-stock fund charges 35 bps in fees. Ryanair Holdings (5.02%), Deutsche Lufthansa (4.98%) and EasyJet 
(4.94%) hold the top three spots in the fund. United States (37.1%) take the top spot in the country allocation, 
followed by United Kingdom (9.4%) and Japan (9.1%). How Does It Fit In a Portfolio? The International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) anticipates a solid surge in traveler numbers and revenues for airlines in 2024. The 
sector is projected to achieve a net profit of $25.7 billion, with a 2.7% net profit margin. This forecast marks a 
modest improvement from the revised estimate of $23.3 billion net profit and a 2.6% margin for the current year,as 
quoted on CNBC[1]. 
Airports Council International too expects a rebound in 2024. The agency believes that the airline travel is projected 
to grow over 25% by 2027 relative to pre-pandemic levels. International travel is expected to contribute to the 
rebound in airline traffic. European travel giant Tui has also issued an optimistic forecast for a 25% rise in EBIT in 
2024 (read: Airlines ETF (JETS) to Surge in 2024 on Solid Travel Forecast?[2]). 
In 2024, the airline industry is set to witness a 7.6% annual increase in total revenues, reaching a historic high of 
$964 billion. The number of travelers is expected to climb to approximately 4.7 billion, surpassing the pre-pandemic 
figure of 4.5 billion in 2019. Competition The expense ratio of the newbie is 50% lower than the category average. 
This is also lower than what the only one pureplay airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS[3] charges, i.e., 60 bps. 
The fund JETS currently has an AUM base of $1.79 billion. 
Apart from this, there are transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF XTN[4] and iShares U.S. 
Transportation ETF IYT[5]. These funds, too, hold airlines stocks. These funds charge 35 bps and 40 bps, 
respectively.

Attached is a link to the Monthly Investment Report for November 2023.
http://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/5590W_1-2023-12-12.pdf
November proved to be a positive month for asset owners, as both bonds and equities rallied sharply. The catalyst 
was a growing hope that falling inflation will not be accompanied by slowing economic growth. This is an ideal 
outcome since it would allow policymakers to gently ease interest rates, helping to sustain high equity valuations 
without dampening earnings. Policymakers have also changed their tone, leaving investors less concerned about 
further monetary policy tightening.
The market moves were significant, with global bonds experiencing their best monthly return since 2008 and US 
equities recording their best monthly return this year. We added to the Company's bond duration in recent months 
to take advantage of compelling valuations (eg US ten year real yields reaching 2.5%), and with the belief that 
yields were reaching levels beyond which they would begin to cause acute pain to the financial system. The 
increased exposure enabled the Company to further benefit from November's rally in fixed income, which was the 
largest contributor to returns over the month. Likewise in equities, we had tactically added to the Company's 
exposure as risk assets struggled with rising yields in prior months. These increases to both bonds and equities 
Monthly Investment Report - November 2023
enabled the portfolio to deliver a positive return and outweighed the headwinds from our protective assets. From a 
stock picking perspective, holdings in Ryanair, Coty and Jackson Financial were large positive contributors, 
alongside exposure to US banks Citi and EastWest.
On the negative side of the ledger, protective positions to guard against pain in the corporate bond market naturally 
suffered in the buoyant environment as credit spreads narrowed sharply. Elsewhere, exposure to energy was a 
headwind, partly as the perceived risk of wider military conflict across the Middle East has faded. Within our growth 
seeking assets, the exposure to Chinese equities continued to stutter. Whilst we deem the visit of Xi Jinping to San 
Francisco as a positive step in easing the tensions between the World's two largest powers, investor sentiment 
remains weak. We acknowledge there are good reasons for the high risk premium applied to Chinese equities, but 
it does stand out for both depressed valuations and, in our view, the increasing likelihood of further policy stimulus 
to come.
Given the speed of the rally across bonds and equities, we felt it was prudent to reduce the Company's exposures 
towards the end of the month. Bond markets are now pricing in over 1% of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the 
Federal Reserve. High equity valuations, tight credit spreads and low volatility suggest complacency may have 
returned to financial markets. There is a path for policymakers to pull off the magic trick of raising interest rates 
aggressively without derailing the economy, but we see an obvious vulnerability should events deviate from this 
narrow route. Policy changes feed through with a lag and the initial signs of a possible soft landing are eerily similar 
to those pre-empting something more severe. The Company's portfolio is designed to deliver positive returns in 
both benign conditions such as we saw this month, but also in those which are likely to be more challenging ahead.

Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Growth Stock
Here's Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Strong Growth Stock

Zacks Investment Research

Byline: Zacks Equity Research

Dec 13, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old 
investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both. 
The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks 
#1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, 
more confident investor. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. 
With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better 
chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a 
stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value 
Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of 
upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly 
percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine 
favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks. 
Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Growth Stock
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio. 
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% 
average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large 
number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, 
on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still 
has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RYAAY has a Growth Style Score of A, 
forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 21.7% for the current fiscal year. 
One analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.23 to $8.87 per share. RYAAY also boasts an average earnings surprise of 18%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

Dec 13, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Copa Holdings, S.A.CPA[1] reported solid traffic numbers for November on the back of upbeat air-travel demand. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits in 
November on a year-over-year basis. 
To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In November, available seat miles (a measure of 
capacity) increased 11.9% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 12.4%. With traffic growth 
outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 87.4% from 
87.1% in November 2022. 
Impressive air traffic has led to an 18.5% appreciation in the CPA stock in the past year. This northward movement 
compares favorably with the 10.7% rise recorded by the Zacks Airline[2] industry in the same time frame. 
Copa Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[3]. 
Given the buoyant traffic scenario, Copa Holdings is not the only airline to report impressive traffic numbers for 
November. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Brazilian carrierAzul S.A. AZUL[4] also reported year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for November 
2023. AZUL's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 8.2% and 8.7%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor came in at 79.2% in November 2023. 
On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year 
over year, respectively. The load factor came in at 78.2% in November 2023. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.6% and 33.9%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 82.5% from 79.7% in November 2022. 
Ryanair HoldingsRYAAY[5], a European carrier, also reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat 
air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 
4% more passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict.

Boeing said Tuesday that it delivered 56 commercial planes in November, an increase as the company tries to fix 
manufacturing problems that have disrupted production of its best-selling aircraft.
Most of the planes were 737 Max jets to airlines and lessors, including eight to United Airlines, seven to Southwest 
Airlines and five to Ireland's Ryanair.
With one month left, Boeing is close to achieving its goal of delivering at least 375 737s this year — it has 351 so 
far. November deliveries nearly matched the total for September and October, when manufacturing issues hindered 
shipments.
Deliveries are an important source of cash for Boeing, since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase 
price at delivery.
Boeing reported orders for 104 commercial planes after cancellations. The company previously announced an 
Emirates order for 90 Boeing 777s at the Dubai Air Show.

Dec 12, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Azul S.A. AZUL[1] reported solid year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for November 2023. 
In November, the Brazilian carrier's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and 
available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year 
basis. The load factor (the percentage of seats filled by passengers) came in at 79.2% in November 2023. 
On the domestic front, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 1.7% and 3.3%, year 
over year, respectively. The load factor came in at 78.2% in November 2023. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.6% and 33.9%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 82.5% from 79.7% in November 2022. 
Azul's chief executive officer, John Rodgerson, stated, 'In November, we continue to see improvements in booking 
trends in a resilient demand environment in both markets, with rational capacity deployment in the domestic and 
surpassing 2019 levels in the international. We continue excited for the strongest period of the year.' 
Impressive air traffic has led to a 58.2% year-to-date appreciation in the AZUL stock. This northward movement 
compares favorably with the 10.9% increase recorded by the Zacks Airline[2] industry in the same time frame. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Given the buoyant traffic scenario, AZUL is not the only airline to report impressive traffic numbers for November. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], a European carrier, also reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat 
air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 
4% more passengers flew than a year ago. 
The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, AZUL carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[4] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[5] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[6]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.02% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
AZUL November Passenger Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 5.1% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 19.4% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 31.5% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 194.8% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

THE BOSS of Ryanair has called for the head of the UK's air traffic control body to step down after an outage at 
Gatwick caused significant disruption.
Flights were grounded and passengers faced hours of delays on Saturday after a system failure at the east-Sussex 
hub's air traffic control tower.
In a statement, Ryanair's combative chief Michael O'Leary said: "It's time for Martin Rolfe to go. At an annual 
package of over £1.5m this clown has repeatedly shown he is incompetent."
The outage at Gatwick is the latest in a string of incidents at the UK's National Air Traffic Service (NATS). In 
August, a "one in 15 million"
system-wide meltdown caused thousands of cancellations across the country's airspace.
"If he won't quit, then transport minister Mark Harper should fire him. These repeated UK NATS system failures are 
unique to the UK and are not repeated in any other European ATC service," O'Leary said. Gatwick Airport has been 
approached for comment.

Is Boeing 's Best-Selling 737 Max a Money-Maker?
Is Boeing's Best-Selling 737 Max a Money-Maker?
Airguide Business & AirguideBusiness.com
December 08, 2023
Copyright 2023 Pyramid Media Group Inc. All Rights Reserved
Section: Air and Travel Business News - Aircraft; ISSN: 1939-666X
Length: 654 words
Body
The Boeing 737 MAX is not just Boeing's highest-volume aircraft; it's arguably its most crucial. However, currently, it 
isn't a money-maker. In the coming years, Boeing aims to change that, and according to J.P. Morgan, it's entirely 
feasible.
For analyst Seth Seifman, MAX profitability remains a few years away. In a recent research report, he stated, 'One 
critical component of Boeing's anticipated $6 billion-plus free cash flow growth between 2023 and 2025-2026 is the 
737 program.'
Despite nearly 400 deliveries expected in 2023, the 737's contribution to cash flow remains modest due to program 
cash costs exceeding what is recognized on the profit and loss statement.
Several factors, including product mix, volume, and quality control, contribute to the 737 MAX's cash flow 
challenges. Boeing has had to address issues even after planes left the assembly line.
Nonetheless, there's optimism for a turnaround. Investors can monitor Boeing's 'deferred production balance,' 
disclosed quarterly, for progress tracking.
Aircraft accounting differs significantly from standard bookkeeping practices. It takes billions and several years to 
bring a new plane to market, but the aircraft's revenue spans roughly 20 years, making revenue and expense 
matching a complex task.
Boeing books revenue when a plane is sold, assuming an average cost. However, actual costs can differ. When 
they exceed estimates, the deferred production balance for the 737 MAX program increases.
A shrinking deferred production balance indicates cost reduction and smoother operations, but it hasn't occurred 
yet. Currently, the balance for the 737 MAX program stands at $5.4 billion, up from $3 billion at the end of 2022. 
Seifman anticipates stabilization in the balance next year, with a decline expected in 2025-2026.
Product mix improvements will play a role. Boeing has been delivering many MAX jets to customers with the best 
pricing, such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair, a trend that's expected to moderate in the coming years.
Is Boeing 's Best-Selling 737 Max a Money-Maker?
In addition to adjusting the customer mix, Boeing must enhance quality, ramp up production, and address the MAX 
inventory accumulated during the global grounding lasting nearly two years, following two deadly crashes from 
March 2019 to November 2020.
All these factors affect Boeing's cash flow statement, and the deferred production balance offers a clear indicator of 
its progress.
Wall Street anticipates Boeing generating approximately $3.2 billion in free cash flow in 2023, marking the second 
consecutive year of positive free cash flow after the pandemic and worldwide grounding challenges.
Between 2019 and 2021, Boeing posted a cumulative negative free cash flow of $28.4 billion, according to FactSet. 
Analysts project a 2025 free cash flow of $11.3 billion, a significant increase over this year's figures.
Investors share the optimism regarding Boeing's improvement goals. Seth Seifman rates the stock as a Buy and 
has raised his price target to $270 from $245.
Over the past 12 months, Boeing's shares have gained about 34%, outperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 
18 percentage points. Investors are enthusiastic about the recovery in global air travel post-pandemic.
Through October, Boeing successfully delivered 298 MAX jets out of a total of 405, as reported on its commercial 
website. Single-aisle aircraft, similar in size to the 737, remain the workhorses of the commercial aerospace 
industry.

British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) and other major European airlines 
slumped after a more cautious view of the airline sector was put forward by JPMorgan, which cut ratings and 
slashed price targets.
Against a backdrop of potentially weaker economic growth, the investment bank highlighted the potential for large 
increases in seat capacity, which could bring revenue per passenger-mile yields down. 
The investment bank prefers low-cost carriers such as Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) to the networks due to 
capacity constraints which could aid pricing. 
It thinks the long-haul supply picture looks more difficult given network capacity increases in particular on 
Transatlantic while lower margins and elevated fuel/ex-fuel cost pressure mean unit revenues are unlikely to grow.  
Balance sheets and valuations do not look overly stretched; however, earnings pressure could send stocks lower, in 
the broker's opinion. 
JPM moved IAG to 'underweight' from 'neutral' and Lufthansa and Air-France KLM to 'underweight' from 
'overweight' with its top sector pick Ryanair - rated 'overweight' - where it noted superior pricing, best-in-class 
margins, and growing net cash.
The broker has nearly halved its price target for IAG to (EURO)1.45 from (EURO)2.80, Lufthansa's target is cut to 
(EURO)7.50 from (EURO)12.00 and Air France to (EURO)9.50 from (EURO)21.50.
British Airways owner IAG nosedives as JPMorgan cuts rating, slashes target
The bank remain 'neutral' on easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ).
Shares in IAG fell 3.6% to 155.65p, Lufthansa fell 4.4% to (EURO)8.20 and Air France dropped 5.9% to 
(EURO)11.92.

An individual has been arrested as part of an investigation into AOG Technics, the company accused of supplying 
suspicious engine parts to airlines, the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced Wednesday Dec. 6.
Affected airlines include Tui, Ryanair, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, TAP 
and Virgin Australia Airlines.
According to Bloomberg, the person in custody is AOG Technics' founder and director, Jose Alejandro Zamora 
Yrala. Business Insider reached out to the SFO for confirmation on this but didn't immediately hear back. AOG 
Technics could not be reached by BI.
"This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the 
consequences of which are potentially far-reaching," said Nick Ephgrave, the SFO director.
"We are determined to establish the facts as swiftly as possible," he added.
The SFO said it raided the Greater London home of the suspect and seized material as part of its investigation.
Aviation authorities in the US, UK, and European Union all issued alerts about AOG Technics earlier this year.
The EU's Aviation Safety Agency said that it suspected the company used false documentation for engine parts of 
an unknown origin.
It left repair shops and airlines scouring their records to find references to AOG Technics.
All three of the major US airlines - Delta, United, and American - are among those who have found parts supplied 
by AOG Technics in their engines.
Some airlines in the US and UK were forced to ground planes because of the scandal. The Independent previously 
reported that at least 100 planes were grounded.
Last week, Ryanair's CEO told Bloomberg that it too had discovered suspect parts during scheduled maintenance 
checks.
Arrest Made in Dodgy Engine Parts Scandal That Affected United , Delta
Southwest was the first major carrier to disclose that it had found parts from AOG Technics in its engines, back in 
September.
"In an abundance of caution, we made an immediate decision to promptly replace those parts on that single 
engine," a spokesperson previously told BI.
The faulty parts were used for CFM56 engines, which power older-generation Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 jets.
Bloomberg reports that the CFM56 is by far the most frequently flown engine, with an aircraft powered by it taking 
off every two seconds around the world.

Belarus Bans Landing of Aircraft from EU without Special Authorization
Belarus Bans Landing of Aircraft from EU without Special Authorization

The government of Belarus has implemented a ban on the landing of any aircraft entering from European Union 
airspace, effective December 3, 2023. The ban requires special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 
landing, and it will be in force until at least March 3, 2024. Overflights are not affected by this decision.
The corresponding NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), O0770/23, was issued to protect national interests, according to 
Belaeronavigatsiya. Simultaneously, the ban extends to aircraft departing from Belarus, preventing them from 
entering the airspace of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia-Belarus's EU neighbors.
The impact of this decision is limited, given that all Belarusian airlines have been banned from entering the EU 
since December 2021. The EU imposed the ban in response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair B737 orchestrated 
by Belarus to arrest anti-government activists on board. Belarus's alignment with Russia during the invasion of 
Ukraine further heightened tensions. Currently, there is no airline traffic between the EU and Russia/Belarus. 
Foreign airlines from non-EU countries, however, continue to serve Minsk National, linking the city with destinations 
in Russia and other Asian countries without overflying the EU.

UK authorities make arrest following investigation into the sale of unapproved jet engine parts

Authorities in London have arrested one person as they investigate the sale of unapproved aircraft parts that have 
turned up in the fleets of several major airlines.
The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said Wednesday that the arrest and seizure of material came during a raid of an 
address in London.
The agency said that it launched a new investigation into fraud at London-based AOG Technics Ltd., which for 
several years has supplied aircraft businesses with parts for popular jet engines produced by CFM International.
Earlier this year, aviation authorities in Europe, the U.K. and the United States warned businesses about the AOG 
parts and asked them to check the origin of parts supplied by AOG.
Suspected unapproved engine parts have wound up at Ireland’s Ryanair, TAP Air Portugal, Virgin Australia and 
several U.S. carriers including American, United, Delta and Southwest, according to published reports.
Fake or unapproved parts have plagued the aviation industry for years, with authorities blaming greed on the part of 
suppliers and poor oversight by regulators.
In some cases, the parts are counterfeits, akin to knockoff handbags. In other cases, they are mislabeled, 
paperwork may be forged, or used parts are passed off as new ones.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has raided an address and arrested one individual as part of a criminal 
investigation into AOG Technics Ltd, the company accused of supplying unauthorised plane engine parts to major 
international carriers.
 AOG Technics was accused in September of a "deliberate, dishonest and sophisticated scheme" to supply 
unauthorised engine parts that ended up in Boeing aircraft.
Lawyers of jet engine maker CFM International told the High Court how AOG potentially sold thousands of engine 
components using forged paperwork, causing Virgin Australia (ASX:VAH), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and 
United Airlines to ground some aircraft when the news came to light.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) was caught up in the scandal earlier this month after reporting the discovery of 
unauthorised aircraft components in two engines.
Barrister Matthew Reeve KC of Quadrant Chambers said there was "compelling documentary evidence that 
thousands of jet engine parts have been sold by (AOG) to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with the 
claimants' jet engines."
Little is known about AOG.
According to Companies House filings, the company has one director, Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, who is also 
listed as a director at Sunwave Solutions Ltd and Kensho Group, the former of which dissolved earlier this year.
Arrest made over 'fakes on a plane' scandal
AOG has taken down its website since the 'fakes on a plane' scandal came to light, while Zamora Yrala does not 
have an active LinkedIn profile.
Nick Ephgrave QPM, director of the Serious Fraud Office, said: "This investigation deals with very serious 
allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far reaching.
"The SFO is best placed to take this investigation forward vigorously and we are determined to establish the facts 
as swiftly as possible."
The SFO has not disclosed the name of the individual under arrest.

December 6th, 2023 ( International Business Times News  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Major airport expansion projects are taking off across Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and a new airline is set to 
launch next year -- all banking on an expected boom in air travel in Southeast Asia, fuelled by Chinese and Indian 
tourists.
But there are doubts about whether it will materialise in an uncertain economic environment and as worries about 
the impact of travel on climate change.
Thailand's Really Cool Airlines is expected to start flying between Bangkok and Japan around mid-2024, but CEO 
Patee Sarasin -- a veteran of the region's cutthroat budget sector -- says it has been a battle to launch a new carrier 
just after a pandemic.
"It's a lot of money. It has been quite gruelling to raise the funds," he told AFP.
"There are some points (where you say) 'why am I doing this?' It crossed my mind many, many times."
Patee ran budget carrier Nok Air for more than a decade, but while he is coy about the finer details of the new 
venture, he claims it may yet "change the aviation paradigm".
Flying took a hammering globally during the pandemic as international travel all but shut down, but the industry is 
bullish about its bounceback, evidenced by a flurry of big-ticket orders at this month's Dubai Air Show and bumper 
profit jumps for the likes of Air France-KLM and Ryanair.
Southeast Asia is becoming a hot property, with private and public players competing for an expanding market.
The region currently accounts for 10 percent of global traffic -- more than 500 million passengers in 2019.
And Boeing expects this figure to grow around 9.5 percent a year over the next two decades, well above the global 
average of 6.1 percent.
Southeast Asia Banks On Aviation Boom
Across the region from Bangkok to Hanoi, governments are splashing billions of dollars to update and expand 
airport infrastructure.
A new terminal opened at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok's main international airport, in September, and a third runway is 
being built.
There are plans for a third terminal at the city's other airport, Don Mueang, as well as a doubling of capacity at 
Chiang Mai in the north, and expansion in the major island tourism hub Phuket.
Cambodia has grand plans to make Phnom Penh's new $1.5 billion airport, expected in 2025, a regional hub to 
compete with Bangkok and Singapore, with about 50 million passengers by 2050.
Further evidence of the kingdom's ambitions came earlier this month with the opening of the new Chinese-funded 
$1.1 billion airport at Siem Reap, the gateway to the Angkor Wat temple complex, Cambodia's biggest tourist draw.
Built as part of Beijing's sprawling "Belt and Road" infrastructure scheme, the Siem Reap airport is designed to 
handle 12 million passengers a year by 2040 -- double the total number of foreign tourists who visited the country in 
2019.
Philip Kao, president of a Siem Reap tourism association, hailed the new airport as a "game changer" because its 
longer runway means it can handle bigger planes flying long-haul.
But while some are hoping for a tourism bounceback, others are grappling with the environmental impact of the 
construction boom.
Outside Ho Chi Minh City, work on what will be Vietnam's biggest airport, the $15 billion Long Thanh terminal, has 
blanketed nearby neighbourhoods in thick red dust.
Tourist numbers are not yet hitting pre-pandemic highs, and Mayur Patel, Asia Director for aviation data 
consultancy OAG said they are unlikely to do so before late 2024 or early 2025.
"It's fragmented from an economic perspective, but there is a coordinated effort to bring tourism back. Complexities 
will ease out in the years to come," he told AFP.
Thailand, where tourism accounts for around a fifth of gross domestic product, has stepped up measures in recent 
weeks to boost numbers by granting visas on arrival to visitors from China and India -- two huge reservoirs of 
customers.
Analysts expect growth to be powered by the growing Chinese and Indian middle classes -- as well as a younger 
generation more keen to travel than their parents.
But OAG warns the region's tourism has sometimes been over-reliant on China, and for now Chinese visitor 
numbers still way below pre-pandemic levels as the Asian superpower grapples with a challenging economic 
slowdown.
In Thailand's deep south, Betong International Airport stands as a monument to misguided expansion.
Opened in 2022 in a remote spot near the Malaysian border, the airport struggled for passengers, and now stands 
idle as airlines halted operations within a few months.

Our weekly Online Travel Update for the week ending December 1, 2023, is below. This week's Update features of 
variety of stories - resort fees, potential new EU traveler regulations and Ryanair's continued pursuit of OTAs. 
Enjoy.
New Traveler Rights Proposed in EU. Privacy and data security, competition and now, traveler rights . . . Our 
friends at the EU Commission have been busy. The latest from the EU Commission proposes changes to existing 
traveler regulations, including free air travel for those accompanying persons with disabilities, deposit limitations on 
package travel and guaranteed refunds for expired travel vouchers. We will continue to keep an eye on these 
proposed changes in the months ahead.
Add Massachusetts to List of States Seeking to Regulate So-Called Junk Fees. Not to be outdone by her 
contemporaries in California, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell announced this past week 
new regulations requiring hoteliers (and others) to display the 'true' price of a night's stay. The proposed regulations 
will now be the subject of a public hearing on December 20, after which the AG can decide whether to move 
forward with putting the regulations into effect with or without changes coming out of the public comments. My bet is 
on the rules becoming effective.
Ryanair's War with OTAs Continues. In the latest salvo in the ongoing war between Ryanair and OTAs, Ryanair's 
CEO called out those OTAs that allegedly charge travelers 'unjustified fees and charges.' OTAs making the 
illustrious list include Kiwi.com, lastminute.com, Opodo and eDreams. Ryanair went on to accuse the UK's Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of ignoring OTAs' 'rampant internet piracy 
and anti-consumer mis-selling.' Earlier this year, some of the largest OTAs (Expedia and Booking.com) sent letters 
to these same UK authorities accusing Ryanair of 'invasive, unnecessary and unfair treatment' of their customers. 
So, what's the real motivation behind these complaints by Ryanair? Is it simply a bizarre form of direct booking

Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY 's Traffic Impresses
Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY's Traffic Impresses

Dec 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, the major news in the airline domain was the inking of Alaska Air Group's ALK[1] deal to buy 
Hawaiian Airlines for $18 per share in cash. The price represents a massive 270% premium to the closing price of 
Hawaiian Holdings HA[2] - Hawaiian Airlines' parent company - on Dec 1 (the last trading day before the deal was 
announced). The transaction is valued at $1.9 billion. This includes $900 million of Hawaiian Airlines' debt. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was also in the news, courtesy of its impressive traffic numbers for November, driven 
by upbeat air travel demand. The antitrust trial, which was debating on JetBlue Airways' JBLU[4] planned 
acquisition of Spirit Airlines SAVE[5], has ended. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Alaska Air's deal to buy 
HA is expected to be accretive to ALK's earnings within two years post-closure, with at least $235 million of 
expected run-rate synergies. In the event of the deal materializing, Alaska Air's fleet will expand to 365 narrow and 
wide-body planes. The transaction has gained approval from the boards of both companies. However, the 
materialization of the buyout is dependent on required regulatory approvals, Hawaiian Holdings shareholders' 
approval (expected to be sought in the first quarter of 2024) and other customary closing conditions. After all these 
steps, the deal is expected to close in 12-18 months. Even after the deal closure, both companies will maintain their 
respective brands[7]. 
In another development, it was announced that ALK will exit the S&P 500 index on Dec 18, 2023. The airline will 
move down to the S&P SmallCap 600. 
2. The number of passengers ferried on Ryanair flights in November was 11.7 million, marking a 4% year-over-year 
rise in passengers. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. 
The reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. 
However, more than 960 flights got canceled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. 
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[8]. 
3. The trial in which the U.S. Department of Justice urged a federal judge to block JetBlue's intended $3.8-billion 
acquisition of Spirit Airlines in an effort to preserve competition among the lowest-cost carriers has been wrapped 
up. The federal judge may allow the merger to proceed if JetBlue divests more assets. Per a Reuters report,[9] U.S. 
District Judge William Young told a JetBlue lawyer that he expected airline fares to rise if no-frills, ultra-low-cost 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALK to Buy HA for $1.9B, RYAAY 's Traffic Impresses
Spirit no longer was around to "undercut everyone else" and drive down prices. The judge, who will decide the case 
in the non-jury trial in Boston, told both parties that he was having "trouble" with the Justice Department's request 
for a permanent injunction blocking a deal in a "dynamic industry facing unique opportunities and challenges in the 
post-COVID environment." Price Performance The following table shows the price movements of the major airline 
players over the past week and during the past six months.

The table above shows that almost all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. Consequently, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index improved 12.2% to $62.3 over the past week. Over the course of six months, the sector 
tracker has decreased 6.1%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

Ryanair has revealed the discovery and replacement of unauthorized engine parts in two of its aircraft during 
routine inspections. The parts, suspected to be supplied by UK-based AOG Technics, were identified several 
months ago during checks in Brazil and the United States. Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, stated that the issue 
involved certain CFM56 engines manufactured by CFM International, impacting several Boeing B737NG and Airbus 
A320ceo family aircraft.
AOG Technics has faced scrutiny for selling parts with falsified Authorized Release Certificates (ARCs), as revealed 
by the European Aviation Safety Agency in August. While the problem has affected multiple airlines globally, 
O'Leary emphasized that Ryanair had been "largely unaffected" by the issue, having never engaged with AOG 
Technics.
The two affected engines are currently in workshops, with the relevant parts forwarded to investigators examining 
AOG Technics. O'Leary called for stricter controls over third-party suppliers in light of this incident. Other airlines, 
including Southwest Airlines, TUI Airways, TAP Portugal, and Virgin Australia, have also temporarily grounded 
aircraft to address the problem. Ryanair operates over 500 Boeing B737NG aircraft.

RYANAIR cancelled 960 flights in November due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, it has been revealed.
In a report, the low-cost airline said it flew 11.7m passengers in November, a four per cent increase on the prior 
year and taking its 2023 total to 180.8m.
However, the number marks a significant dip in October's figure of 17.1m. Load factor, the proportion of seats filled 
by passengers, sat at 92 per cent.
Airline shares dipped after Hamas invaded Israel last month, amid investor concern over route offerings and a spike 
in oil prices. The Irish carrier already cancelled over 870 flights in October due to the violence in the Middle East.
Ryanair has been one of the few major carriers to see shares continue rising in the quieter autumn months, 
following this summer's record season of travel.
Budget rival Wizz Air reported a more measured fall in November's passenger numbers, carrying 4.8m passengers, 
down from 5.4m the prior month.
Chief executive of Wizz Air, József Váradi told City A.M. that the war had created a "ripple effect" on demand 
across neighbouring countries.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) reported a strong increase in passenger numbers, capacity and load factor in 
November. 
The budget airline operator said it carried 4,760,154 passengers, representing a 29.3% increase compared to 
November 2022, at a load factor of 88.4%. 
Capacity was 28.8% higher at 5,384,679 seats. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, capacity rose 27.6%, passenger numbers jumped 34.9% and the load factor increased 
4.9 percentage points to 91.1%. 
The company said it has decided to restart inbound flights to Chisinau, Moldova from December 14, but has 
suspended operations in Israel until early January 2024. 
Gerald Khoo at Liberum said the acceleration in both passenger and capacity growth in November compared with 
the trend of recent months "surprised us".
"This comes against a tougher comparative and management had guided to capacity growth slowing," Khoo 
pointed out. 
Retaining a 'hold' rating, Khoo added that although "there was (as usual) no commentary on unit revenues, we 
would see the balance of risks being to the downside with faster growth and flat load factors".
Wizz Air and Ryanair report jump in passenger numbers in November
Separately, Ryanair also posted its traffic numbers, with passenger numbers rising 4% to 11.7 million passengers 
from 11.2 million last year with an unchanged load factor of 92%.

Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) are flying in different directions, according to analysts at Deutsche 
Bank.
Central Europe-focused Wizz is downgraded to a 'sell' with its target price slashed to 1,550p from 2,850p, while 
Dublin-listed Ryanair gets a healthy target upgrade to (EURO)24.50 from (EURO)21.00.
Overall, Deutsche Bank says prices in peak periods are approaching a ceiling but off-peak there are gains to be 
had.
Ryanair continues to see healthy premiums and stands out in the short-haul market and can still get a re-rating in 
2024 as this feeds through, especially as Deutsche Bank says its forecasts are below consensus.
For Wizz Air, the reverse is the case and the broker suggests that consensus forecasts are too high, hence the 
downgrade.
Shares in Ryanair were unchanged at (EURO)15.40 while Wizz eased 0.6% to 1,935p.

Dec 04, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported solid traffic numbers for November, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 11.7 million, implying that 4% more passengers 
flew than a year ago. 
The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 92% in November 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 66,400 flights in November 2023. However, more than 
960 flights got cancelled due to the Israel/Gaza conflict. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 60.7% so far this year compared with 6.6% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. Passenger volume has been 
robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic. The company recently reported 
second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023) revenues of $5,361.3 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $5,137.7 million. 
Revenues improved year over year driven by upbeat passenger volumes. Further, traffic grew 11% to 105.4 million 
during the first half of fiscal 2024. On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax grew 59% 
year over year during the first half of fiscal 2024. Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[4] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[5]. Each stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.02% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 5.1% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 17.3% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SKYW's current-year 
earnings has improved 31.5% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 181.3% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

Dec 03, 2023( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  
 This is true of booze, of drugs, of tobacco and, yes, jet engine parts[1]:  
Ryanair has found 'fake parts' in two of its aircraft engines during scheduled maintenance checks, becoming the 
latest airline to be impacted by a brewing scandal. 
The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been 
removed from the engines, the low-cost carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary told Bloomberg News. 
It comes as the global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators 
scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment. 
We do not, of course condone this. But we do know quite a bit about it as a result of having been out there in that 
international and global economy for all these decades.  
The difficulty is that the nut, bolt or screw for a jet engine is worth 5x to 10x with the right piece of paper than it is 
without. Let's not make the situation more complicated than that. It's righteous that it should too, traceability of parts 
in something so complex, so horrendous in effects if failure occurs, is a very good idea indeed. 
But, it's always going to happen that people will try to trade across a 5x to 10x price difference. Note that this is not 
a result of markets or capitalism. This isn't neoliberalism run riot - this is just what happens among humans. This 
also doesn't mean that people who do even fake jet engine parts should not be righteously jugged, not that we 
should not investigate allegations of it - as here, allegations only so far. 
What it does mean is that governments simply cannot go around creating 5x and 10x price differences as will be 
true of banning tobacco and so on. Because people simply will trade across those differences. As they do with 
drugs, at large scale, and as currently also does happen with both tobacco and booze.  
With jet engines the consumers - the airlines - absolutely do not want fake parts at any price. For knowing use of 
them would likely violate both their insurances and also their licences. Now switch the model to one where 
consumers do desire the item on offer - drugs, booze, baccy. There is that demand, there is that profit margin, trade 
will happen across it. 
This then being the message for the prohibitionists. Even if it were true that society would be better without these 
things - it wouldn't - it still won't work. And there's absolutely no point at all in implementing a policy that won't work. 
So, don't.

Ryanair caught up in unauthorised aircraft parts scandal
Ryanair caught up in unauthorised aircraft parts scandal

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has reported the discovery of unauthorised aircraft components in two engines, 
making the Irish carrier the latest to be embroiled in a scandal involving the distribution of aircraft parts with falsified 
certification documents.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the parts likely originated from UK-based AOG Technics, although Ryanair had 
no direct business dealings with the little-known group.
The unauthorised parts were found and removed during routine maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil in recent 
months.
 AOG Technics was accused in September of a "deliberate, dishonest and sophisticated scheme" to supply 
unauthorised engine parts that ended up in Boeing aircraft.
Lawyers of jet engine maker CFM International told the High Court how AOG potentially sold thousands of engine 
components using forged paperwork.
Barrister Matthew Reeve QC of Quadrant Chambers said there was "compelling documentary evidence that 
thousands of jet engine parts have been sold by (AOG) to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with the 
claimants' jet engines", according to Reuters reporters covering the case.
Virgin Australia (ASX:VAH), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines grounded some aircraft when the 
news came to light, though Ryanair remains "largely unaffected" overall by the scandal, O'Leary commented.
Ryanair caught up in unauthorised aircraft parts scandal
According to Companies House filings, AOG has one director, Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, who is also listed as a 
director at Sunwave Solutions Ltd and Kensho Group, the former of which dissolved earlier this year.
AOG has taken its website down, while Zamora Yrala does not have an active LinkedIn profile.

Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, is set to establish its third seasonal base in Croatia at Dubrovnik airport in early April 
2024, furthering its commitment to the Croatian market. Similar to its existing seasonal bases, including the one in 
Zadar, the Dubrovnik base will operate during the summer months.
As part of the expansion, Ryanair will base two Boeing 737-8-200 aircraft at Dubrovnik airport and introduce 16 new 
routes, enhancing connectivity to popular destinations across Europe. The newly announced routes include:
London Stansted (2x daily)
Rome Fiumicino (10x weekly)
Stockholm Arlanda
Helsinki Vantaa
Berlin Brandenburg International
Milan Bergamo
Paris Beauvais
Brussels Charleroi
Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden
Memmingen
Kraków John Paul II International
Manchester International
Düsseldorf

Poznan
Oslo Torp
Wroclaw (4x weekly each)
In addition to the new routes, Ryanair will increase frequencies on existing summer-only routes from Dublin 
International (from 4x weekly to 2x daily) and Vienna (from 3x weekly to 8x weekly). The move aims to meet 
growing demand and provide passengers with expanded travel options during the summer season.
While Ryanair currently does not operate flights to Dubrovnik in the winter season, the establishment of a seasonal 
base highlights the airline's strategic focus on capturing summer travel demand in the popular Croatian destination.
Ryanair's other bases in Croatia include Zagreb Franjo Tudman, serving as the only year-round destination, and 
seasonal bases in Osijek, Pula, Rijeka, and Split during the summer months. The expansion into Dubrovnik further 
solidifies Ryanair's presence in the Croatian market, providing travelers with increased accessibility to diverse 
European destinations during the peak travel season.

European low-cost heavyweights Ryanair and Easyjet reported net cash positions at the end of September 2023, 
which will help support increasing capital expenditure in the coming years.
Ryanair's net cash totalled (EURO)840 million ($919 million) as of 30 September, versus (EURO)560 million in 
March and net debt of (EURO)500 million as of 30 Sep 2022, with over (EURO)1 billion of debt repayments made 
during the first half of the year. All of the Group's owned Boeing 737 fleet (534 aircraft) are unencumbered, said the 
carrier.
Ryanair took delivery of 26 Boeing 737 Max 8200s in the first half of the year to reach 124 Max units at the end of 
September. The company noted that its debt free 737 fleet provides flexibility for financing options including bonds 
through its Euro medium term notes (EMTN) programme, bank financing, sale and leasebacks and Jolco 
financings.
The carrier said it is on track to repay its second 2023 bond of (EURO)750 million due next month and (EURO)2.8 
billion of fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures (capex) using internal cash resources. "We are determined to pay 
down our remaining debt as it matures between now and 2026," the carrier stated in its first half results.
UK low-cost carrier Easyjet returned to a net cash position of £41 million ($52 million) at the end of fiscal-year 2023. 
This compares with net debt of £670 million at the same time in 2022 and £326 million as of 30 September 2019.
Easyjet had unrestricted access to £4.7 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash, cash equivalents and money market 
deposits of £2.92 billion (versus £3.64 billion in 2022) and borrowings of approximately £1.85 billion, despite 
repaying £1.2 billion of gross debt and the purchase of 10 aircraft during the year.
During the financial year, it repaid the drawn element of the UK Export Finance (UKEF) facility and its February 
2016 (EURO)500 million Eurobond, reducing gross debt.
The carrier also repaid $950 million of debt under the UKEF facility, replacing it with a new $1.75 billion undrawn 
five-year sustainability-linked term loan facility in the third quarter.
European LCCs leverage net cash positions
Easyjet said this benefited net interest costs in the second half of the financial year, with a positive impact from 
higher interest rates on cash balances throughout the whole year, resulting in the net finance charge for the year of 
£48 million being 59% lower than the prior year.
"This strength, reflected in the investment grade credit ratings we hold, positions easyJet to be able to prepare for 
the capex coming over the next few years, as aircraft deliveries increase, but also provides a base to deal with 
those challenges and opportunities that the current macro-economic environment may present," it said in its annual 
report.
The carrier reported headline ROCE of 12.6% driven by the higher headline profit before interest, foreign exchange 
gains and tax of £476 million this year, combined with the reduction in net debt.
In October Easyjet sold three Airbus A319 units to parties and leased them back. The carrier booked £32 million in 
gross proceeds. This followed the sale and leaseback transactions of eight A319 aircraft in the 2023 financial year 
which resulted in a net cash inflow of £76 million.
Easyjet's total fleet as of 30 September 2023 comprised 336 aircraft, compared with 320 aircraft a year ago.

 Posted by Andy Cullwick, head of marketing at Legal Futures Associate First4Lawyers[1] 
Cullwick: Consumers want to interact on their terms 
Good customer service should be a priority for any business and, if you want to stay ahead of the competition, 
something that's constantly under review. 
According to a recent Salesforce report[2], 80% of customers now consider their experience with a company to be 
as important as its products. This is particularly important if you're not able to compete on price. 
Brands such as Ryanair may have built their business on being cheap, but if you cannot undercut competitors, then 
you need to focus your efforts on making sure that your service stands out. 
Reviews and feedback forms will help you gauge satisfaction levels, but if you want to take a more proactive 
approach, then I'd recommend giving customer journey mapping a try. 
Get connected 
If the process is new to you, then the Salesforce report is a good starting point. Now on its sixth annual edition, the 
global survey of more than 14,000 customers and business buyers provides a useful snapshot of behaviours and 
trends to watch out for. 
It says that 69% of consumers want to talk to a company in real time, for example, while 84% consider it crucial that 
they are treated like a human and not just a number. 
Consumers' number one frustration with organisations is disconnected experiences, it says, so isn't it worth 
reviewing your own offering? 
Customer journey mapping helps you to see your business through a customer's eyes. The idea is that you map out 
the touchpoints and then create user journeys for each type of client, which helps you to see what happens and 
when, and what you are missing. 
There is software for this, but you can also do the mapping manually using a pen, a pack of Post-it notes and as 
much information about your customers as you can find. Google Analytics is a great place to start, but you should 
also gather any other available data, such as from customer reviews, complaints, feedback forms and, crucially, 
colleagues, especially any in customer-facing roles who may have valuable insight to add. 
How a good customer journey can put your business on the map
Identify any pain points - a particular website page with a high drop-off rate, for example - potential solutions to the 
problem and next steps to put them into practice. 
Finally, make sure you follow-up to see if the measures implemented have been effective and repeat the mapping 
exercise regularly as consumer habits can and do change. 
Touchpoints 
What the common touchpoints are has changed significantly in the last few years and particularly since the Covid 
pandemic, which saw more communications move online. 
Consumers want to interact on their terms with live chat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and other social media 
channels increasingly becoming the chosen points of contact rather than traditional email or phone. 
A common disconnect in many companies is that staff who handle new phone or email enquiries do not have 
access to social media accounts so that they can also respond to enquiries through those channels in real time. 
Not only do you need to ensure you are using all your routes to market to attract prospective clients, but that when

Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA ( GOL , Financial ) has experienced a notable fluctuation in its stock price over 
recent periods. With a current market capitalization of $6.11 billion and a stock price of $3.82, the company has 
seen a 2.55% gain over the past week. However, the past three months have painted a different picture, with a 
25.49% loss in stock value. This volatility in stock performance is a critical point of analysis for investors and market 
watchers alike.
Understanding Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA
Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, a prominent player in the transportation industry, is a Brazilian airline that 
operates both domestic and international flights. The company's business model is divided into flight transportation 
services and the Smiles loyalty program. The majority of GOL's revenue is generated from its domestic operations, 
which is a significant factor to consider when analyzing the company's financial health and stock performance.
Profitability Analysis
When it comes to profitability, GOL has a Profitability Rank  of 4/10, which suggests moderate performance within 
the industry. The company's Operating Margin  stands at 14.10%, outperforming 69.25% of 956 companies in the 
same sector. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) figure is not applicable, and the Return on Assets (ROA) is at a 
low 0.63%. The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is more favorable at 6.77%. Over the past decade, GOL has 
managed to be profitable in only two years, which is a concern for long-term investors.
Growth Prospects
The Growth Rank  for GOL is currently at 1/10, indicating significant challenges in the company's growth trajectory. 
The 3-Year Revenue Growth Rate per Share has declined by 50.60%, and the 5-Year Revenue Growth Rate per 
Share has decreased by 43.60%. Despite these concerning historical figures, the Total Revenue Growth Rate 
(Future 3Y To 5Y Est) is projected at 16.12%, which could signal a potential turnaround for the company's revenue 
streams.
What's Driving Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA's Surprising 25% Stock Rally?
Investor Holdings
Notable investors have taken positions in GOL, with  Jim Simons  ( Trades , Portfolio ) holding 313,100 shares, 
representing a 0.02% share percentage.  Jefferies Group  ( Trades , Portfolio ) holds 177,549 shares, accounting 
for a 0.01% share percentage. The involvement of these investors may provide a level of confidence in the 
company's future performance.
Competitive Landscape
In comparison to its competitors, GOL's market cap of $6.11 billion positions it between Azul SA ( BSP:AZUL4 , 
Financial ) with a market cap of $1.25 billion and larger airlines such as Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL , Financial ) and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC ( DUB:RYA , Financial ), with market caps of $23.06 billion and $21.36 billion, respectively. 
This comparison highlights GOL's standing within the industry and the competitive challenges it faces.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA's recent stock performance has been a mixed bag, with short-term 
gains overshadowed by a significant three-month loss. The company's valuation, as indicated by the GF Value , 
suggests that it is currently fairly valued, a shift from the previous assessment of a possible value trap. While 
profitability remains moderate, growth prospects show potential signs of improvement. The investment by major 
holders and the company's position relative to its competitors are also key factors to consider. As the airline 
industry continues to navigate a challenging environment, GOL's future performance will be closely watched by 
investors and industry analysts alike.

Ryanair Loses Court Battle Over French and Swedish COVID Aid
Ryanair Loses Court Battle Over French and Swedish COVID Aid

Ryanair  has faced a setback as the Court of Justice of the European Union rejected the airline's appeal concerning 
COVID-19 support measures provided to airlines in Sweden and France during the early stages of the pandemic. 
The court ruled against all arguments put forward by the low-cost carrier in a decision issued on November 23.
In 2020, France and Sweden implemented measures to alleviate financial pressures on their airlines. France 
allowed operators with a French air operator's certificate (AOC) to defer payments for civil aviation and solidarity 
taxes, while Sweden permitted its AOC holders to obtain government guarantees for loans of up to SEK 5 billion 
kronor (USD 476 million). These measures received approval from the European Commission.
Ryanair contested the decision and initially challenged it in the European Union's General Court. The General Court 
dismissed the application, leading Ryanair to escalate the matter by appealing to the Court of Justice on five 
grounds. The arguments included allegations of discrimination, infringement of the free movement of services, 
errors in the application of a balancing test, and a violation of procedural rights.
Justice Alfredo Calot Escobar dismissed all five arguments and upheld the previous decisions. He emphasized that 
aid cannot be deemed incompatible with the internal market based solely on whether it is selective or distorts 
competition. The ruling requires Ryanair to cover its costs as well as the European Union's costs. Additionally, the 
governments of Sweden and France, as interveners in the initial action, are obligated to bear their costs.
This decision marks a legal setback for Ryanair and underscores the complexities surrounding state aid in the 
aviation sector during the pandemic. Stay tuned for further developments as the airline industry continues to 
navigate the aftermath of COVID-19.

Highlight: The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has confirmed that Boeing's new 737 MAX 10 model has 
begun its flight testing certification process with the granting of a type inspection authorisation.
Body
The authorisation means that the aircraft manufacturer can now begin a flight testing program that will count 
towards certification of the model with the participation of FAA pilots.  FAA confirmation of the step comes after 
reporting on a letter sent to Boeing employees that hailed the certification as a "significant milestone" for the 
company.  Reuters reported on a letter signed by Mike Fleming, Boeing's senior vice president for development 
programs, Ed Clark, 737 program head, and Wayne Tygert, the testing lead.  It said: "This is a significant milestone 
as we work to get the 737-10, the largest airplane in the 737 MAX family, certified to enter passenger service with 
operators around the world."  While the FAA's certification usually marks the beginning of a certification process, 
there is now a set timeline for the full approval of the model, and the FAA added "safety will dictate the certification 
timeline."  The 737 MAX 10 is the largest plane of the single-aisle 737 MAX family with a seating capacity of 
between 188 and 204 and a length of 43.8m, though the plane has the smallest range in the group at 3,100nm.  
The aircraft has already been popular with airlines ahead of its launch, with Ryanair placing an order for up to 300 
of the planes in May in an order worth around $40bn.

Airlines are struggling to convince investors to back the travel recovery despite reporting booming profits and 
splurging tens of billions on new planes.
The MSCI index tracking global airlines is trading about 40 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. It has fallen more 
than 20 per cent since the start of July, even as many industry groups including IAG, which owns British Airways, 
easyJet and Singapore Airlines have reported record earnings.
Carriers have also ordered more than 2,800 planes so far this year in a multibillion-dollar bet the industry is set for a 
period of strong growth.
Yet high fuel prices have combined with economic fears and concerns about consumer spending to unnerve 
investors, who have long seen airlines as a cyclical sector vulnerable to external shocks, from volcanic ash clouds 
and pandemics to economic downturns.
One investment banker said the industry was considered "uninvestable" by many investors after the pandemic.
Some airlines are still in vogue. Shares in Asian carriers including Singapore Airlines have performed well as the 
region is still enjoying a post-pandemic surge in travel after opening up slowly.
Investors wary of airlines despite record profit High fuel prices and economic risks weigh on industry and keep 
share prices languishing below pre-pandemic leve....
US airlines with less exposure to the slowing domestic market outperformed their peers, while Ryanair, the budget 
carrier, has been picked out as a longterm winner in Europe after using the pandemic disruption to its advantage to 
embark on a period of rapid growth.
However, shares in Air France-KLM hit a record low on the same day the company announced a record profit in the 
third quarter.
"Investors are fully looking through the results with an eye on macro risks into the northern hemisphere winter," said 
Alex Irving, a Bernstein analyst.
The investor scepticism in Europe comes despite airlines reporting strong demand for travel into the winter, 
although data released this month showed a hit to bookings globally following the outbreak of war in the Middle 
East.
"There is always this question 'summer is good but how about winter?'" said Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of Wizz 
Air, the budget carrier. "Winter is good, too."
This year's profits have been built on an increase in air fares, as high demand for flying has collided with a shortage 
of aircraft.
But some cracks have appeared in the US market, where several leading airlines have announced profit warnings 
off the back of rising costs including labour and fuel.
With investor scepticism running high, the latest round of airline earnings "needed to be flawless", said Conor 
Cunningham, analyst at Melius Research. "They were largely mixed, resulting in consistent selling pressure," he 
said.
There have also been signs that airlines are putting on too many flights in the domestic market just as demand has 
begun to slow, putting pressure on yields as carriers inevitably have to reduce fares to fill planes.
"You've got fuel, capacity and demand all headed in the wrong direction, we're kind of the canary in the coal mine," 
Barry Biffle, chief executive of domestic-focused Frontier Airlines, said at an industry event last month.
Goh Choon Phong, Singapore Airlines chief executive, said while he expected "robust" demand for the rest of the 
financial year to March, there had been recent signs that airfares have "softened" in his market, too.
Carriers including Ryanair, easyJet and Southwest Airlines have still scrambled to lock in increasingly scarce 
delivery slots from Boeing and Airbus, in particular for single-aisle, or narrow-body, aircraft for short-haul flights.
Although one of the factors driving demand is the need to replace older aircraft, the spree has prompted questions 
about whether some airlines are at risk of over-ordering.
Combined order backlogs for Airbus and Boeing, the plane makers, are at record highs of more than 13,900 to the 
end of October, according to data from Cirium, the aviation consultancy.
These will swell further after a flurry of orders from Middle Eastern airlines, including Emirates, during last week's 
air show in Dubai.
Rob Morris, head of Cirium's Ascend consultancy business, warned the orders pose a risk for the airlines given the 
"global and regional macroeconomic and geopolitical drivers which seem to be increasingly difficult to predict post-
Covid".
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, said the industry had a history of mistiming these transactions, ordering planes 
enthusiastically during boom times only for the aircraft to arrive just as demand and yields fall.
Investors wary of airlines despite record profit High fuel prices and economic risks weigh on industry and keep 
share prices languishing below pre-pandemic leve....
"The expectation is that in a number of markets, capacity will be fully restored just when there is a slowdown in 
economic activity or consumer expenditure," said Tarry.
"The aviation market most certainly does not adjust instantly and without cost," he added.

EU Justice Court Dismisses Ryanair's Appeal Against COVID-19 State Aid 
for Airlines

 The European Union's Court of Justice on Thursday rejected Ryanair's (RYA.IR) appeal against the state aid 
provided by France and Sweden to airline companies back in 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The justice court said France's deferral of tax payments for airlines holding a French license and Sweden's loan 
guarantee scheme of up to 5 billion kronor for airlines holding a Swedish license "cannot be considered 
incompatible with the internal market for reasons that are linked solely to whether the aid is selective or distorts or 
threatens to distort competition."
The Ireland-based low-cost carrier initially challenged the measures in the EU General Court, which dismissed 
Ryanair's petition and ruled that both schemes were compliant with EU law.
Ryanair's shares were down nearly 2% in late morning trading.

In response to heightened security concerns, both Wizz Air and Ryanair have decided to suspend their flights to 
Aqaba, Jordan. The Hungarian low-cost carrier, Wizz Air, has rerouted some of its flights to Amman Queen Alia, 
while Ryanair announced a complete suspension of all flights to Aqaba from November 11, 2023, through January 
4, 2024. Ryanair cited "operational restrictions beyond its control" as the reason for the suspension.
Wizz Air, according to Flightradar24 ADS-B data, canceled its services to Aqaba from Warsaw Chopin between 
November 13 and 17, attributing the decision to "security-related reasons." The airline flew its November 21 rotation 
to Amman, with further flights to Aqaba remaining canceled. Additionally, Wizz Air removed its planned services 
from Katowice, originally set to launch in mid-December 2023, from its internet booking engine. Meanwhile, Wizz 
Air Abu Dhabi, which initially connected Aqaba with Abu Dhabi International, began flying to Amman on November 
19.
Despite the absence of current operational or safety NOTAM affecting the airlines' ability to fly to Aqaba, the 
proximity of the Jordanian airport to the Israeli border (just two kilometers) and its location around 200 kilometers 
from the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military is engaged in conflict with Hamas, may have contributed to the 
decision.
It's noteworthy that Turkish Airlines and Royal Jordanian are continuing their services to Aqaba, maintaining 
operations amid the temporary suspensions by Wizz Air and Ryanair.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has laid into the European Union after announcing a host of flight cancellations 
on Monday due to the latest strikes by French air traffic controllers.
Explaining it had been forced to cancel flights in a statement, Ryanair argued the effects of strikes had become 
"unfair" due to the lack of overarching minimum service laws in Europe.
"Ryanair calls on the EU [...] to take urgent action to protect overflights and EU citizens' freedom of movement 
during air traffic control strikes," the Irish airline said.
Some 86 Ryanair flights were cancelled on Monday morning, as per tracking website FlightAware, while over 100 
others faced delays.
According to Ryanair, the 65 days of air traffic control-related strikes in 2023 marks a 13-fold increase in the 
number of industrial action days seen last year.
Monday's strike by French workers relates to new laws requiring management to be informed of strike action at 
least 48 hours in advance.
Airlines have been hit by costs of flight cancellations out of their control on several occasions this year, including in 
August when UK air traffic restrictions were temporarily put in place due to a system shutdown.
Ryanair shares slipped 0.8 % to (EURO)17.34.

Air traffic controllers' strike hits flights over France
Air traffic controllers' strike hits flights over France

Body
An air traffic controllers' strike in France led to cancellations and delays on Monday, and also affected flights 
travelling from other countries through French airspace.
Ahead of the industrial action, the Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) had asked Paris-Orly and Toulouse airports to 
reduce the number of flights by 25%. In Bordeaux and Marseille, 20% of flights were to be cancelled.
Other airports and airlines flying over France, on their way from Germany to Spain, for example, were also affected.
The airline Ryanair called on the EU to protect overflight rights and the freedom of movement of EU citizens during 
the air traffic controllers' strike.
This year, air traffic has already been disrupted on 65 days during strikes by French air traffic controllers, leading to 
the cancellation of thousands of flights from Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland and the UK.
France had prioritized flights within France during emergency operations during the strikes, which budget airline 
Ryanair described as unfair.
The current strike by French air traffic controllers was directed against a government decision that obliges air traffic 
controllers to give 48 hours notice of whether or not they will take part in a strike.
This is intended to make restrictions in air traffic more predictable and allow time for measures to mitigate them.

(ANSA) - NOV 20 - The main problem with Italy's air-transport sector is not high prices but its low capacity and this 
is linked to the costs airlines face here, Ryanair Chief Commercial Officer Jason McGuinness told ANSA on 
Monday. Italy's competition authority said last week it has launched a fact-finding investigation into the use of 
pricing algorithms in passenger air transport on routes between the Italian mainland and the island regions of Sicily 
and Sardinia. 
Earlier in the year Premier Giorgia Meloni had announced a cap on the prices of flights to the two islands, following 
a spike in the summer, but it reconsidered the plan after Ryanair and other airlines complained it breached 
European law. "Italy doesn't have a price problem, but it does have a capacity problem, a shortage of seats," 
McGuinness said. "To be able to guarantee low fares in Italy, it is necessary to reduce the costs that airlines face. 
"But, unfortunately, this is not happening. Italy is not competitive. The government must realize this. "It has nothing 
to do with the algorithm, that's nonsense, you're barking up the wrong tree". He said, for example, that air-
traffic.control costs are 70% higher in Italy than in Spain. McGuinness also called on the government to abolish the 
local 'addizionale comunale' tax on departures.

Over the year to 30 September 2023, the Company's net asset value per share (NAV) total return was 8.3% 
compared to a total return of 20.5% for the comparative index. The share price total return for the same period was

public benchmarks, though operational progress remains good; and payments processing company Adyen which 
fell after announcing some market share losses in the US.

Chairman's Statement
Performance
The net asset value per share ('NAV') total return over the Company's financial year was 8.3% compared to a total 
return of 20.5% for the FTSE Europe ex UK Index, in sterling terms. The share price total return over the year was 
8.6%; as at 30 September 2023 the discount to NAV of the Company's shares was 13.6%.
The dramatic shift in macroeconomics and interest rates of all durations has continued to make it a challenging time 
for growth investors. Discount rates have risen; price earnings ratios are conversely lower. Despite strong 
operational performance from most of our holdings (further detail provided in the Managers' report on below) the 
share prices of the types of companies we own have not recovered from the significant falls we saw in the previous 
year, and in some cases have fallen further.
Since Baillie Gifford began managing the portfolio in November 2019, the NAV total return has been 9.3% 
compared to a total return of 25.1% for the FTSE Europe ex UK Index, in sterling terms. The share price total return 
has been 2.6%, with the discount widening from 7.5% to 13.6%.
After an initially strong run of performance, the Company has suffered two years of poor investment results. This 
has damaged the longer run outcome for now. The Board is painfully aware of the volatility and disappointment this 
has entailed for shareholders but is confident that Baillie Gifford's currently out-of-favour growth style will be 
vindicated in the longer term. The reason equity investment yields the best long run returns is that it involves 
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
volatility and requires patience and, on occasion, a degree of endurance. The Board therefore considers it 
premature to make a proper assessment of long-term performance.
Earnings and dividend
During the year the Company received a repayment of tax (and interest) from HMRC, totalling £7.9 million (2.20p 
per share) following receipt of a settlement agreement in relation to the Franked Investment Group ('FII GLO') 
computational-based claims. The Board distributed this to shareholders as a special interim dividend of 2.20p per 
ordinary share on 15 September 2023.
Revenue return per share for the year was 2.68p (2022 - 0.79p) and the Board is recommending a final dividend of 
0.40 p per ordinary share (2022 - 0.70p). Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting ('AGM'), 
the dividend will be paid on 2 February 2024 to shareholders on the register on 5 January 2024. The ex-dividend 
date will be 4 January 2024.
Borrowings
The Company has two (EURO)30 million long-term debt facilities: the first has a remaining duration of 17 years and 
is priced at a fixed rate of 1.57% and the other has over 12 years outstanding at a fixed rate of 1.55%. The 
Company also has an undrawn (EURO)30 million overdraft facility with The Northern Trust Company, which at 
present is capped at (EURO)15 million following Board agreement. At the year end, the Company had gearing of 
15.6% of shareholders' funds.
Share buybacks, issuance and discount
Over the course of the Company's financial year, the share price moved from a 13.5% discount to NAV to a 13.6% 
discount to NAV. During this period, the Company bought back 538,471 shares at a total cost of approximately 
£501,000. The shares repurchased by the Company are held in treasury and are available to be reissued, at a 
premium, when market conditions allow.
The Board is of the view that the Company should retain the power to buy back shares during the year and so, at 
the AGM, is seeking to renew the annual authority to repurchase up to 14.99% of the shares in the Company in 
issue. When buying back shares, the Board does not have a formal discount target and is prepared to buy back 
shares opportunistically.
The Company also has authority to issue new shares and to reissue any shares held in treasury for cash on a non 
pre-emptive basis. Shares are issued/reissued only at a premium to NAV, thereby enhancing NAV for existing 
shareholders. The Directors are, once again, seeking 10% share issuance authority at the AGM. As with the buy 
back authority, this authority would expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2025.
The Board
As noted in the 2022 Annual Report, Dr. Woodward will stand down from the Board at the AGM. The Board 
therefore undertook a recruitment process seeking to appoint an additional independent non-executive Director and 
was pleased to announce the appointment of David Barron with effect from 1 October 2023. David has spent 25 
years working in the investment management sector and was until November 2019 Chief Executive Officer of Miton 
Group PLC following six years with the firm. Prior to this he was Head of Investment Trusts at JP Morgan Asset 
Management for more than ten years having joined Robert Fleming in 1995. David will stand for election at the 
upcoming AGM. On Dr Woodward's departure from the Board, Andrew Watkins will become Chair of the Audit 
Committee and Emma Davies Senior Independent Director. It is my intention to stand down at the 2025 AGM, at 
which time David will replace me as Chair. The Board intends to undertake a recruitment process next year and 
anticipates appointing a further Director by 30 September 2024.
The Board wishes to thank Dr Woodward for his many years of commitment, service, energy and insight and, in 
particular, for his assiduity and experience in the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 11 a.m. on 18 January 2024 at the Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London, SW1Y 
5ED. The Managers will make a presentation and I look forward to meeting shareholders who are able to attend. To 
accurately reflect the views of shareholders of the Company, the Board intends to hold the AGM voting on a poll, 
rather than by a show of hands as has been customary. This will ensure an exact and definitive result. The Board 
encourages all shareholders to exercise their votes on the AGM resolutions by completing and submitting the form 
of proxy enclosed with the Annual Report to ensure that your votes are represented at the meeting (whether or not 
you intend to attend in person).
If you hold shares through a share platform or other nominee, the Board encourages you to contact these 
organisations directly as soon as possible to arrange for you to submit votes in advance of the AGM. Alternatively, 
the Association of Investment Companies' ('AIC') website theaic.co.uk/how-to-vote-your-shares has information on 
how to vote your shares if you hold them via one of the major platforms. The following link will also take you through 
to the AIC website where there is information on how your platform can help you attend the AGM in person 
theaic.co.uk/aic/ready-to-invest/shareholder-voting/attending-an-agm.
Should shareholders have questions for the Board or the Managers, or any queries as to how to vote, they are 
welcome, as always, to submit them by email to trustenquiries@bailliegifford.com or call 0800 917 2112.
Information on the resolutions can be found on pages 110 and 111 of the Annual Report. The Directors consider 
that all resolutions to be put to shareholders are in their and the Company's best interests as a whole and 
recommend that shareholders vote in their favour.
Outlook
Fund managers are nearly always prone to regard the current environment as difficult. It is no exaggeration, 
however, to describe the present geopolitical turmoil and deterioration in the fabric and harmony of both democratic 
and autocratic societies as troubling and unusual. 25 years of unprecedented and arguably reckless money printing 
has come home to roost. Adding value in anticipating big picture change either good or bad is difficult, even 
accepting an element of reflexivity: one thing leads to another. Inflation leads to falling living standards and, 
historically, wars. The good news, as ever, is in the degree of innovation, disruption and commercial success that 
can flow from human ingenuity. Stock-picking in the form of focussing on what might go right is the best way to 
explore and mine this seam. Growing, high quality companies delivering goods and services that enhance their 
customers' lives are worthy of attention and investment. Our Managers are adept at this activity. They have been 
sticking to their guns. In this we support them.
Michael MacPhee
Chairman
16 November 2023
Managers' Report
We took over management of the Company four years ago with the aim of investing in Europe's most dynamic 
growth companies. Since then, the share price has experienced a spectacular rise and equally spectacular fall. 
Adjusted for the share split, we started at just over 80p, peaked at around 170p, and ended the current period 
almost where we started. While we continually ask ourselves what we could have done differently, Baillie Gifford 
has been managing European portfolios since 1985 and has experienced poor performance before. Many of our 
most successful companies have been through similarly difficult bouts. Just as those companies did, we emerged 
from each one in a stronger position. We do not wish to downplay the recent period of poor performance. We think 
about it every
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
day. Disappointing as this is, however, it is more important to consider where the share price will be five years from 
now.
Over short periods there are many variables that help dictate what a company is worth. These include interest 
rates, risk appetite, social media, and many of the behavioural shortcomings from which we humans regularly 
suffer. Companies make mistakes too - operational hiccups happen. These are businesses run by real people trying 
to navigate complex issues and unpredictable events. Over longer periods of time, however, these variables play a 
far less significant part. What is more important for value creation is a strong, durable corporate culture, and the 
ability to grow profitably over time. We will make mistakes, but if we build and maintain a portfolio of high-quality 
growing businesses run by people we trust, we believe that we can deliver for our shareholders.
Performance
Over the last financial year, the Company's NAV delivered a total return of 8.3% while the FTSE Europe ex UK 
index returned 20.5% in sterling terms. The Company's share price total return was 8.6%, ending the period at 
83.6p, representing a discount of 13.6% to the NAV. This compares to a discount of 13.5% at the beginning of the 
period.
Despite these relative returns, we are increasingly optimistic about the future. Operational progress has been at 
least in line with our expectations, and we are seeing many affirming signals that our companies are taking 
advantage of this environment, investing while peers retrench, carrying out acquisitions, and buying back shares. 
We are not the only ones who think the selloff is overdone.
Positive contributors in the period include Ryanair, which continued to take market share from weaker airlines and 
invest in new capacity. Online classified companies Adevinta and its major shareholder Schibsted showed that they 
can offset temporarily weaker volumes with price increases. Both companies' share prices have also been boosted 
by news that a private equity consortium is looking to acquire Adevinta. Freight forwarder DSV and building 
materials manufacturer Kingspan continue to execute well, and both have been linked with potential large-scale 
acquisitions made feasible by their strong balance sheets. Spotify continues to grow healthily and now boasts over 
550m monthly active users. After much investment, its recent focus has shifted to profitability using cost reductions 
and price increases as levers. This shift is underway at many technology companies, although Spotify is the first to 
be rewarded by the market.
Some companies performed less well. Battery startup Northvolt was written down to reflect moves in public 
benchmarks, though operational progress remains good. Elsewhere, payments processing company Adyen fell 
almost 50% in the week after announcing some market share losses in the US. This looks temporary to us, though 
we continue to monitor progress and debate the attractiveness of the new, lower valuation. Sartorius Stedim 
Biotech, which manufactures bioprocessing equipment for the biologics industry, also reported negative news, 
noting a slowdown in demand and higher inventories. Again, these issues feel temporary, and
we have made a modest addition. Swedish gaming company Embracer has been more disappointing. The 
investment case centred on the founder's strategy of acquiring media content and gaming studios and letting their 
founders flourish in a decentralised organisation. Unfortunately, this was a case of overpromising and 
underdelivering, and management is now being forced to sell assets to pay down debt. We have some sympathy 
for the idea that the company is now undervalued, but we have lost faith in the management team and the board. 
Trust in management and alignment are non-negotiable for us so we have sold our entire position.
Improving performance
We genuinely believe that the future looks brighter than the past. Cynics may argue that this is what all 
underperforming fund managers say, so the onus is on us to explain the underpinnings of our optimism. So, what 
are the catalysts to drive improving performance?
Cognitive psychologist Gary Klein, in his book 'Seeing What Others Don't', suggests that performance is improved 
by 'reducing errors and increasing insights'. As we have written before, our main error has been misjudging the 
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
impact of rapidly shifting monetary policy on the valuations of growth companies. Because the companies in the 
portfolio tend to be smaller and grow much faster than average, most of their lifetime cashflows are in the future, 
and these are now being discounted at a much higher rate than they were. We have therefore felt the impact of 
rising rates much more acutely. When panic sweeps the market,
it is the more nascent, higher growth companies that get hit hardest.
In order to minimise future valuation risk, we monitor interest rate and duration risk in the portfolio and construct a 
reverse discounted cashflow model for every company we look at. These process tweaks will help us test our 
assumptions on valuation, but also to take advantage of opportunities in a volatile market. This is crucial - the 
potential upside is much greater than the potential downside, so while minimising errors is important, it is less 
important than identifying insights to help us invest today in tomorrow's winners.
Insights
"Insights shift us toward a new story, a new set of beliefs that are more accurate, more comprehensive, and more 
useful. Our insights transform us in several ways. They change how we understand, act, see, feel, and desire."
- Gary Klein
We strive to identify insights. We look for new ways of seeing companies, truths that others are perhaps less able to 
see, potential that the market is not currently discounting. This is how one outperforms the market over the long 
term. Klein suggests that insights are often generated through pattern recognition and making connections as a by-
product of coincidence or curiosity. Insights can also come from contradictions and inconsistencies. When we come 
across things that don't make sense, we need to build new mental models to understand what is going on. For us 
this is happening more and more when thinking about company valuations.
We have underperformed over the past two years - this simple observation is irrefutable. Interest rates have risen, 
and valuation multiples have fallen. However, here's the contradiction: over the past two years, the forward price-to-
earnings multiple of our portfolio has fallen by 50%, from 34x to 17x*, which is a 40% premium to the index we are 
trying to outperform. If you believe sell-side analysts, earnings per share (EPS) of our portfolio are expected to grow 
12% per annum over the next three years which compares favourably to 4% per annum for the index. At those 
rates, the valuation multiple of our portfolio would be below that of the index within five years, although we would be 
disappointed if it wasn't sooner. This doesn't make any sense to us. The companies we invest in typically grow 
faster than the index and we would expect this to continue for far longer than five years. We think they are higher 
quality, have unique corporate cultures, have less debt, and are run by some of the best capital allocators in 
Europe. Things can always get cheaper but even the idea that our portfolio would trade at a discount to the index in 
a few years highlights just how inefficient the market is at valuing growth.
So, what's going on? Part of the explanation could be related to hyperbolic discounting. This is a complicated 
sounding way of saying that future profits are being excessively discounted. We are reminded of the 1972 Stanford 
marshmallow experiment, led by psychologist Walter Mischel, which set out to measure a child's willingness to 
defer gratification. Children would often choose to devour one marshmallow immediately rather than wait fifteen 
minutes to receive two. This desire to experience immediate rewards at the expense of bigger rewards in the future 
plagues markets as much as children.
As long-term investors, we believe that the market tends to underestimate the attractiveness of special companies 
over long periods. This inefficiency becomes much more acute during times of stress, when time horizons shrink, 
risk appetite diminishes, and a premium is placed on certainty. It's no great surprise, then, that market breadth has 
narrowed sharply since 2021. Many have sought refuge in the perceived safety of the largest companies in the 
index regardless of their fundamentals or valuations. We've long believed that the midcap space in Europe contains 
a high proportion of future outliers, but this view is increasingly at odds with what the market is pricing in. This won't 
last forever, so we believe that this is the time to be adding to those stocks where we see asymmetric payoffs.
Portfolio
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Portfolio turnover for the year was 9%, implying an average holding period of just over 10 years. During the second 
half of our financial year, we made six new investments in public companies: EQT, one of the world's largest and 
most reputable private equity firms; LVMH and Moncler, two luxury goods companies that are getting better as they 
get bigger; Soitec, an innovative French semiconductor company exposed to rapidly growing markets; Royal 
Unibrew, a multi-beverage company with serial acquirer characteristics; and Eurofins, a global lab testing business 
we've been waiting patiently to buy for many years. We also made a new investment in an unlisted Italian software 
company called Bending Spoons, which has a unique approach to monetising consumer mobile apps. This is a 
diverse, high-quality, highly profitable collection of companies growing much faster than the market, with meaningful 
inside ownership and attractive valuations.
During the same period, to make way for these new holdings, we completely sold five investments. We have 
already mentioned Embracer, but food delivery firm Just Eat Takeaway.com and green holding company Aker 
Horizons didn't work out either. Just Eat Takeaway.com suffered from an ill-timed acquisition in the highly 
competitive US market. Legislators also introduced fee caps which effectively turned a profitable business into a 
loss making one. With Aker Horizons we underestimated how difficult it would be for its portfolio of clean tech 
businesses to generate profits. MedTech distributor Addlife, and heat pump manufacturer NIBE, have been more 
successful. During the Covid pandemic, Addlife benefitted from increased demand for diagnostics and hospital 
equipment, while demand for NIBE's energy efficient heat pumps far exceeded supply during the energy crisis. In 
both cases we determined that valuations had risen too much, and that the capital would be best redirected into 
better ideas.
Private companies
While the Company can invest up to 20% of total assets in private companies, we currently have five investments 
accounting for around 11%: Northvolt (4.9%), McMakler (1.8%), sennder (1.8%), Flix (1.5%) and Bending Spoons 
(0.9%). Overall operational progress has been good and both Northvolt and Flix are rumoured to be considering an 
initial public offering ('IPO') in 2024.
We think giving investors low-cost access to private companies that would otherwise be unavailable is an attractive 
proposition. Companies are staying private for longer, as many of them are relatively asset light and therefore 
require little capital to grow. As a result, many are in the fortunate position to be able to choose their investors. We 
think our reputation as long-term growth investors and our ability to invest in both private and public markets mean 
we are advantaged when it comes to deal flow. We absolutely believe that investing in Europe's increasingly 
dynamic private companies can generate significant value and provide insights into a level of disruption not 
normally seen in public markets.
Northvolt
Our very first private investment is becoming increasingly important to us and the broader European economy. 
Northvolt was founded in 2016 by two former Tesla executives backed by two Swedish entrepreneurs who wanted 
to accelerate decarbonisation. Their mission was to produce the world's greenest batteries with the lowest carbon 
footprint. In just seven years, the company has taken on over 4,000 employees, secured more than $8bn in funding, 
and received more than $55bn in orders from customers like BMW, VW, Scania, Siemens and ABB. This is truly 
remarkable.
At 4.9% it is the largest position in the portfolio, so its success will help underpin any rebound in performance. The 
rumoured IPO in 2024 is just a milestone for us if it happens as we can continue holding the shares if there remains 
sufficient upside. Either way it should be very high profile particularly given its strategic importance to Europe's 
automotive industry, politicians, and financial institutions who all want to see it succeed. Europe cannot afford to 
rely on Asian battery manufacturers. It needs to build its own supply chain and Northvolt is the best chance we 
have.
Northvolt's opportunity is large and growing. In Europe alone, battery demand is expected to increase from around 
150GWh in 2022 to 1,370GWh in 2030. This is likely to be revised upwards as new markets and applications 
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
emerge. We suspect this will be a commoditised market, but Northvolt's strategy seems well-suited. Important 
aspects of this strategy include:
· An ambition to lower the carbon footprint of a battery to 10kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour, a 90% 
reduction from the current industry benchmark. This will be driven by access to very cheap renewable hydroelectric 
power, using responsibly sourced raw materials, and using at least 50% recycled material.
· Its unique vertical integration. Everything from cathode production to cell assembly to recycling will be done in-
house. This not only lowers carbon emissions but also helps capture more recycled materials and improves quality.
· A European supply chain. A local champion needs local supply, and Northvolt's aim is to source 90% of 
components from within Europe. This creates a lot of alignment with those customers and politicians responsible for 
orders and subsidies.
· A focus on talent. Northvolt has assembled one of the best R&D teams in the world. Battery chemistries and 
technological roadmaps will evolve so it is important that the company can adapt and compete with its Asian 
competitors.
During an investment trip to Sweden with the Board, we recently visited Northvolt's first factory, Northvolt Ett, in the 
small town of Skellefteå. The 200-hectare site near the Arctic Circle is equivalent to around 300 football pitches, so 
is a highly ambitious project. The current plan is to produce 150GWh of batteries by 2030, but there is upside 
potential to this figure. To put this into context, if the average electric car has a 70kWh battery, this would be 
enough to power more than 2 million of the 11 million cars sold in Europe in 2022. Using public estimates for battery 
prices in 2030, this could result in $10-15bn in sales. Engineering and manufacturing at this scale poses 
tremendous challenges, and there will no doubt be delays and setbacks. If Northvolt succeeds, however, the payoff 
for investors could be huge.
Outlook
Our investment style is very much out of favour, and we have undoubtedly made mistakes, but we have the right 
people and corporate culture at Baillie Gifford to persevere through this difficult time. There are plenty of geopolitical 
tensions and economic headwinds to worry about, but we must not let such factors overshadow the adaptability, 
innovation, and capital allocation of the companies we invest in. We are riding on the coat-tails of founders, families 
and management teams who are doing all the hard work. That this work is being so discounted by the market gives 
us confidence in a brighter outlook for returns from here.

Investments in securities are financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. In 
accordance with FRS 102 the tables above provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value 
hierarchy described below which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair 
value.
Fair value hierarchy
The levels are determined by the lowest (that is the least reliable or least independently observable) level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows:
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Level 1 - using unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market;
Level 2 - using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are directly or indirectly observable 
(based on market data); and
Level 3 - using inputs that are unobservable (for which market data is unavailable).
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on pages 92 and 93 of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis by valuation technique of the unlisted securities is 
on pages 104 and 105 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

The Company's shareholder authority permits it to hold shares bought back in treasury. Under such authority, 
treasury shares
may be subsequently either sold for cash (at a premium to net asset value per ordinary share) or cancelled. At 30 
September 2023 the Company had authority to buy back 53,228,811 ordinary shares. During the year to 30 
September 2023, no ordinary shares (2022 - nil) were bought back for cancellation and 538,471 ordinary shares 
were bought back into treasury at a cost of £500,000 (2022 - £7,444,000). Under the provisions of the Company's 
Articles of Association share buy-backs are funded from the capital reserve. The Company has authority to allot 
shares under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board has authorised use of this authority to issue new 
shares at a premium to net asset value per share in order to enhance the net asset value per share for existing 
shareholders and improve the liquidity of the Company's shares. During the year to 30 September 2023 no shares 
were issued (in the year to 30 September 2022 - no shares were issued).

Automatic Exchange of Information
In order to fulfil its obligations under UK tax legislation relating to the automatic exchange of information, the 
Company is required to collect and report certain information about certain shareholders.
The legislation requires investment trust companies to provide personal information to HMRC on certain investors 
who purchase shares in investment trusts. As an affected company, Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust will have 
to provide information annually to the local tax authority on the tax residencies of a number of non-UK based 
certificated shareholders and corporate entities.
Shareholders, excluding those whose shares are held in CREST, who come on to the share register will be sent a 
certification form for the purposes of collecting this information.

Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation ('SFDR')
The EU SFDR does not have a direct impact in the UK due to Brexit, however, it applies to third-country products 
marketed in the EU. As Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust is marketed in the EU by the AIFM, Baillie Gifford & 
Co Limited, via the National Private Placement Regime, the following disclosures have been provided to comply 
with the high-level requirements of SFDR. The AIFM has adopted Baillie Gifford & Co's Governance and 
Sustainable Principles and Guidelines as its policy on integration of sustainability risks in investment decisions.
Baillie Gifford & Co's approach to investment is based on identifying and holding high quality growth businesses 
that enjoy sustainable competitive advantages in their marketplace. To do this it looks beyond current financial 
performance, undertaking proprietary research to build an in-depth knowledge of an individual company and a view 
on its long- term prospects. This includes the consideration of sustainability factors (environmental, social and/or 
governance matters) which it believes will positively or negatively influence the financial returns of an investment. 
More detail on the Managers' approach to sustainability can be found in the Governance and Sustainability 
Principles and Guidelines document, available publicly on the Baillie Gifford website bailliegifford.com.
Taxonomy Regulation
The Taxonomy Regulation establishes an EU-wide framework of criteria for environmentally sustainable economic 
activities in respect of six environmental objectives. It builds on the disclosure requirements under SFDR by 
introducing additional disclosure obligations in respect of alternative investment funds that invest in an economic 
activity that contributes to an environmental objective. The Company does not commit to make sustainable 
investments as defined under SFDR. As such, the underlying investments do not take into account the EU criteria 
for environmentally sustainable economic activities.
Glossary of Terms and Alternative Performance Measures (APM)
An Alternative Performance Measure ('APM') is a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, 
financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial 
reporting framework. The APMs noted below are commonly used measures within the investment trust industry and 
serve to improve comparability between investment trusts.

Total assets
This is the Company's definition of Adjusted Total Assets, being the total value of all assets less current liabilities, 
before deduction of all borrowings.
Shareholders' funds
Shareholders' Funds is the value of all assets held less all liabilities, with borrowings deducted at book value.
Net asset value
Net Asset Value is the value of total assets less liabilities with borrowings deducted at either book value or fair value 
as described below. The net asset value per share (NAV) is calculated by dividing this amount by the number of 
ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares).
Net asset value (borrowings at fair value) (APM)
Borrowings are valued at an estimate of market worth. The fair value of the Company's loan notes is set out in note 
19 on page 107 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
.
A reconciliation from shareholders' funds (borrowings at book value) to net asset value after deducting borrowings 
at fair value is provided below.

Net liquid assets
Net liquid assets comprise current assets less current liabilities, excluding borrowings.
Discount/premium (APM)
As stockmarkets and share prices vary, an investment trust's share price is rarely the same as its NAV. When the 
share price is lower than the NAV it is said to be trading at a discount. The size of the discount is calculated by 
subtracting the share price from the NAV and is usually expressed as a percentage of the NAV. If the share price is 
higher than the NAV, it is said to be trading at a premium.

Gearing (APM)
At its simplest, gearing is borrowing. Just like any other public company, an investment trust can borrow money to 
invest in additional investments for its portfolio. The effect of the borrowing on shareholders' funds is called 
'gearing'. If the Company's assets grow, shareholders' funds grow proportionately more because the debt remains 
the same. But if the value of the Company's assets falls, the situation is reversed. Gearing can therefore enhance 
performance in rising markets but can adversely impact performance in falling markets.
Gearing is the Company's borrowings adjusted for cash and cash equivalents expressed as a percentage of 
shareholders' funds.
Gross gearing is the Company's borrowings expressed as a percentage of shareholders' funds.
Leverage (APM)
For the purposes of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Regulations, leverage is any method which 
increases the Company's exposure, including the borrowing of cash and the use of derivatives. It is expressed as a 
ratio between the Company's exposure and its net asset value and can be calculated on a gross and a commitment 
method. Under the gross method, exposure represents the sum of the Company's positions after the deduction of 
sterling cash balances, without taking into account any hedging and netting arrangements.
Under the commitment method, exposure is calculated without the deduction of sterling cash balances and after 
certain hedging and netting positions are offset against each other.
Active share (APM)
Baillie Gifford Europe Growth Tst plc Final Result
Active share, a measure of how actively a portfolio is managed, is the percentage of the portfolio that differs from its 
comparative index. It is calculated by deducting from 100 the percentage of the portfolio that overlaps with the 
comparative index. An active share of 100 indicates no overlap with the index and an active share of zero indicates 
a portfolio that tracks the index.

Antitrust opens probe into flight prices to islands (3) 'High prices for Sicily and Sardinia coincide with peak

Antitrust opens probe into flight prices to islands (3); 'High prices for Sicily 
and Sardinia coincide with peak demand'
ANSA English Corporate Service

Body
(ANSA) - NOV 16 - Italy's competition authority said on Thursday it has launched a fact-finding investigation into the 
use of pricing algorithms in passenger air transport on routes between the Italian mainland and the island regions of 
Sicily and Sardinia. "This decision is based on the fact that, coinciding with the resumption of demand for 
passenger air transport starting in 2022, institutional and non-institutional actors have detected high prices in 
correspondence with periods of peak demand," the antitrust authority said in a statement. The competition 
watchdog said the probe would "focus on the possible negative impact of the use of pricing algorithms on market 
functioning and the conditions of supply to consumers" as well as on "how airline ticket prices and their various 
components are communicated to the public". The investigation comes after the government of Premier Giorgia 
Meloni reconsidered controversial new rules concerning air fares on certain domestic routes in its so-called 'Asset' 
decree, eliminating the price cap of 200% of the average fare and giving the Italian competition authority powers to 
verify possible abuses particularly on routes to Sicily and Sardinia due to their specific transportation needs. 
"The conduct exercised (by airlines) on the routes to the islands, the period of peak seasonal demand, and prices 
that are more than 200% above the average fare are considered circumstances and indications that the Authority 
can take into account," read the technical report accompanying an amendment to the decree presented by the 
government during the process of conversion into law in parliament. Airlines had blasted the price cap, arguing to 
the European Commission trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) that it could "set a precedent and lead to a domino 
effect" as well as "violating" the rights of companies to '"compete wherever possible, set prices and define services 
as they see fit". Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson also slammed the measure, describing it as "ridiculous, illegal and 
interfering with the free market, according to European law" and later announcing an eight per cent reduction in the 
air line's services to and from the Italian island region of Sardinia this winter as a direct result.

GLOBAL dividend payouts dipped by one per cent on a headline basis in the third quarter of 2023, according to 
Janus Henderson's latest Global Dividend Index.
Total distributions fell to $421.9bn in the third quarter from $425.8bn the quarter prior, mainly thanks to a strong 
dollar and lower special dividends.
Adjusted for currency, underlying growth stood at 0.3 per cent.
However, when the two biggest dividend cutters - Brazilian oil producer Petrobras and Australian miner BHP - were 
excluded, underlying growth was 5.3 per cent.
Payouts in the UK grew 1.5 per cent on an underlying basis in the third quarter.
In contrast, Europe saw payouts jump 23 per cent, leaving the region "comfortably" on track to deliver record 
distributions this year.
Janus Henderson found UK dividend growth was held back by sharp cuts in distributions from the mining sector, 
though it pointed to Glencore as a notable exception.
This year saw Glencore shareholders receive £6bn after record profits.
"These reductions masked strong growth from the wider market, with more than half the non-mining companies in 
our index delivering double-digit growth," the report read.
Banks, oil companies and utilities made the largest contribution to dividend growth in the UK.
UK dividend growth lags as Europe set for record payouts
This month saw a profit-pumped Ryanair announce plans for its first ever regular dividend.
According to AJ Bell's latest dividend dashboard, the total FTSE 100 dividend pay-out is expected to reach £78.7bn 
in 2023.
This would be down from the £83.8bn predicted three months ago but marginally higher than the £76.1b paid out in 
2022, when excluding special dividends.
Dividend forecasts in the UK continue to slip as FTSE 100 profit projections fall back.
Pretax profit across the FTSE 100 is expected to rise by just ten per cent this year, a cut from the 19 per cent 
growth predicted three months ago.
As a result, AJ Bell warned it will be difficult for total distributions to return to the record of £85.2bn recorded by 
FTSE 100 companies in 2018.

Nov 15, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Zacks Airline [1]industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand following the easing of COVID-19 
travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand 
for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger 
revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[2], Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes 
GOL[3], Azul S.A. AZUL[4] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported impressive traffic numbers for September 
2023. CPA, GOL and RYAAY each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). AZUL is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' October traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in October on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In October,

In October, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) increased 2.6% on a year-over-
year basis, while available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) fell 1.2%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity 
expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for October 2023 improved to 84.5% from 
81.4% in October 2022. The number of flight departures at GOL in October registered a 3.1% year-over-year 
increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 8.6% year over year.

factor increased to 84.6% from 81.6% in October 2022. Internationally also, the load factor increased to 83.4% from

passengers on board rose 9% year over year.

Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)delivered 34 airplanes during October, according to new data published on Tuesday by 
theairplane manufacturer. This included 18 737 MAX jets, a military version of the 737, six 787 Dreamliners, six 
767s and three 777 cargo planes to a range of customers including the U.S. Navy, Air India, Alaska Airlines, FedEx 
(NYSE:FDX) Express, Ryanair, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines. In the year-to-date, Boeing has 
delivered 405 aircraft, including 305 737s and 56 787s. The plane maker needs to ramp up its production efforts to 
meet its delivery guidance for the year of 375 to 400 737s and 70 to 80 787s. Before the release of its third quarter 
financial results in late October, Boeing had been expecting to deliver more 737s, targeting 400 to 450 deliveries by 
the year-end. 
Boeing said in October it is transitioning to the production of five 787 planes per month instead of four, with plans to 
increase to 10 per month by 2025/2026. It anticipates production of 38 737s per month by the year-end, ramping up 
to 50 per month by 2025/2026. Boeing shares traded higher on Tuesday after it announced a spate of purchase 
ordersin recent days, including orders from Emirates for 90 777X airplanes and from Ethiopian Airlines for 11 787s 
and 20 737s. The stock was up 1.6% at US$207.78 and has gained 8.6% week-over-week. Contact the author at

In a recent legal development, Ryanair has faced another setback in its ongoing legal battle with online travel agent 
(OTA) Kiwi.com. The Regional Court in Brno, Czech Republic, ruled in favor of Kiwi.com on November 7, 2023, 
rejecting Ryanair's attempt to compel the OTA to provide customer credit card details and email addresses.
The long-standing dispute stems from Ryanair's objection to Kiwi.com selling its flights without any direct 
commercial relationship between the two entities. Ryanair has initiated several lawsuits against Kiwi.com and other 
OTAs globally, aiming to prevent them from scraping fare information and reselling tickets. The airline has accused 
Kiwi.com of supplying false passenger contact and payment details.
A key point of contention is the lack of specific passenger details, including contact information and payment 
details, in OTA bookings. Ryanair contends that this information is crucial for direct communication with passengers 
in case of issues like delays or cancellations. OTAs argue that they act as bona fide agents for passengers, while 
Ryanair's motive is perceived as an attempt to eliminate them from the market.
This particular legal matter dates back nearly three years, with a Czech court initially ordering Kiwi.com to provide 
data to Ryanair in early 2021. However, the OTA successfully appealed this ruling. Subsequently, in late 2021, 
Kiwi.com was again instructed to release the data by a lower court. Although the higher court annulled this ruling, it 
focused on procedural matters rather than the dispute's substance.
Legal disputes between Kiwi.com and Ryanair are ongoing in Italy and Spain, highlighting the complexity of the 
broader conflict between airlines and OTAs over data and distribution practices.
Kiwi.com's CEO, Oliver Dlouhý, welcomed the recent court decision, expressing hope that it would end the 
longstanding allegations made by Ryanair against OTAs. Dlouhý suggested that Ryanair's insistence on obtaining 
unnecessary customer information is a tactic to stifle competition.
While the decision is not final, as Ryanair plans to appeal, the legal dynamics underscore the ongoing tension 
between traditional carriers and OTAs in the evolving landscape of airline distribution and data sharing. Stay tuned 
for updates on this legal saga as it continues to unfold.

Gaza war hits demand for international flights Airlines
Gaza war hits demand for international flights; Airlines

Demand for international flying has fallen in recent weeks, according to new data, with a significant hit to bookings 
to the Middle East in the first signs that the war in Israel is affecting air travel.
Global flight bookings made in the three weeks after the October 7 Hamas crossborder raid on Israel were 20 per 
cent below 2019 levels, according to travel industry data company ForwardKeys.
The decline reverses a trend in which demand had been increasing sharply after international air travel plummeted 
during the pandemic. Before the attack, bookings were tracking at 15 per cent below 2019 levels.
Airlines have reaped bumper profits over the past six months on strong demand for travel at high ticket prices, but 
have faced persistent questions over whether bookings will weaken into the northern hemisphere winter.
Few have reported a slowdown in demand, although several, including Ryanair, have warned their outlooks were 
dependent on geopolitical events.
Olivier Ponti, a senior executive at ForwardKeys, said that the war had "jeopardised the strong recovery trend in 
demand" seen throughout the year.
"This war is bound to put people off travelling to the region, but it has also dented consumer confidence in travelling 
elsewhere too," he said.
Gaza war hits demand for international flights Airlines
Many airlines had cut flights to Israel following the attacks. But the flight data offers one of the first indications of 
how the geopolitical uncertainty appears to have affected air travel more broadly.
The data is drawn from the industrywide ticketing database from the International
Air Transport Association and includes big national carriers. However, it does not have sales from low-cost carriers 
such as Ryanair or easyJet.
The hit to flights to the Middle East has been most dramatic, with bookings falling 26 percentage points from 13 per 
cent above 2019 levels in the weeks before the attacks, to 13 per cent below.
Bookings for flights from the US have also taken a hit, with a 10 percentage point drop taking them from 6 per cent 
above 2019 levels to 4 per cent below.

The low-cost carrier plans to pay (EURO)0.35 per share for 2024 and 25 per cent of annual profits afterwards
The share prices of many lowcost airlines have taken a hit over the past three months as investor concerns about 
the durability of travel demand in a tougher economic climate have grown.
Management at Ryanair remains as bullish as ever, though - announcing that the airline will pay a maiden dividend 
of (EURO)400mn (£347mn) this year, and distribute 25 per cent of its post-tax profit from 2025 onwards.
Although the company has a huge order of 300 new Boeings to pay for, chief executive Michael O'Leary said it was 
generating strong enough profits and cash flows to allow for sustained payouts. Revenue for the six months ending 
in September rose by 30 per cent to (EURO)8.6bn and earnings per share jumped by 72 per cent to (EURO)1.91, 
with passenger numbers, ticket prices and ancillary revenues all advancing at double-digit levels.
Third-quarter bookings are also expected to be stronger than last year, and the company said full-year post-tax 
profit was expected to be between (EURO)1.85bn to (EURO)2.05bn. At its midpoint that is about 7 per cent higher 
than the current Bloomberg consensus, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.
Ryanair's shares jumped 6 per cent on the announcement. They trade at 10 times broker Peel Hunt's forecast 
earnings for next March's year-end, falling to nine times for the following year. Given its record and potential to 
continue grabbing more market share, we see this as decent value and justification for our buy call. Michael Fahy

Wizz narrows outlook after being forced to ground jets Airlines
Wizz narrows outlook after being forced to ground jets; Airlines

Wizz Air has cut its annual profit forecast after bing hit by an "unprecedented operational challenge" and 
geopolitical uncertainty.
The London-listed airline yesterday said it would be forced to ground 45 of its roughly 200 planes because of 
potential problems with their Pratt & Whitney engines.
József Váradi, chief executive, said the company expected to be compensated by the engine maker for its direct 
financial losses.
However, it was facing an "unprecedented operational challenge" that could last 18 months as the engines were 
removed for inspection amid concerns over contaminants in the powdered metal used to make them.
"I don't think the industry has ever gone through this," he said. "This is new territory. But we think we are ready for 
it. We will be covered for the financial losses, but we have to still protect capacity and remain intact as a competing 
force."
Wizz has tried to contain the worst impact of the groundings by using its remaining aircraft more intensively and 
extending leases, while it has continued to take deliveries of new Airbus planes.
But the engine problems will hit growth plans, with schedules in the year beginning March 2024 forecast to be "at 
similar levels" to the current year.
Wizz narrows outlook after being forced to ground jets Airlines
"While the group is offsetting the headwind as best it can ... it is not enough to maintain expansion, and a lower 
number of operating aircraft will mean numbers have to come down," said analysts at Bernstein.
Wizz said it expected to report a net profit for the current financial year of between (EURO)350mn and 
(EURO)400mn, down from guidance in June of (EURO)350mn to (EURO)450mn.
Other airlines have also faced supply chain problems, including delays in deliveries of new aircraft. Ryanair has 
said it is concerned its summer season next year could be hit by delays in receiving new aircraft from Boeing.
Váradi said the narrowed guidance was also down to geopolitical uncertainty and war in the Middle East. Wizz has 
suspended flights to Israel, which account for 5-6 per cent of its flight schedules, and reported a slowdown in sales 
to neighbouring countries.
Shares in Wizz dropped 9.8 per cent in London yesterday.
The airline became the latest to report strong trading over the summer, with net profit of (EURO)400mn for the six 
months to the end of September, up from a (EURO)384mn loss a year earlier. Wizz said it had "positive bookings" 
in the current quarter.
Separately yesterday, Emirates said profit in the six months to the end of September had risen 134 per cent against 
a year earlier to a record $2.6bn on strong demand for air travel, on revenues that were up 19 per cent to $16.2bn.
By the end of September the airline was operating passenger and cargo services to 144 airports as it restored 
operations to destinations such as Nice, Beijing and Shanghai.
Emirates carried 26.1mn passengers over the half-year, up 31 per cent on the same period 12 months earlier. 
Average passenger seat factor reached 81.5 per cent, up from 78.5 per cent in the same period last time.

Nov 10, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and 
revenues for third-quarter 2023. The results were hurt by the year-over-year decline in air traffic apart from the rise 
in fuel costs. Average fuel price per gallon increased 6.5% sequentially in third-quarter 2023. Latin American carrier, 
Gol Linhas GOL[2] reported a loss in the September quarter. 
Fortunes were brighter for European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], which reported better-than-
expected earnings per share and revenues for second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 30, 2023), driven by upbeat 
passenger volumes. Riding on the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, another Latin American carrier Azul AZUL[4] 
reported rosy traffic numbers for the month of October. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Low-
cost carrier Allegiant reported third-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding $1.53 from non-recurring items) of 9 cents per 
share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents but surged more than 100% year over year. 
Operating revenues of $565.4 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $583.7 million but increased 
marginally on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk (91.3%) of the top line, 
remained flat on a year-over-year basis. Management now expects 2023 earnings per share (airline) in the $7.75-
$8.50 (prior view: $10.50 - $13.00) range. 
Updates on the third-quarter earnings report of another low-cost carrier, JetBlue Airways JBLU[5], are available in 
the previous week's write-up[6]. 
2. Gol Linhas incurred third-quarter 2023 loss of 25 cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
earnings per share of 4 cents. In the year-ago quarter, GOL had incurred a loss of 75 cents. Net operating revenues 
of $956 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $974.4 million. Management now expects [7]capacity to 
increase 10%-15% year over year in 2023. 
Currently, Gol Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
3. Ryanair reported second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share of $7.21, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $7.13 and improved year over year. Revenues of $5,361.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
of $5,137.7 million. Average airfare, which rose 24% in the first half of fiscal 2024, is expected to rise year over year 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Q3 Earnings Miss, GOL 's Loss & More
by mid-teens percentage in the fiscal third quarter. Management expects [9]fiscal 2024 traffic to be 183.5 million. 
Profit after tax is anticipated in the range of €1.85 billion and €2.05 billion for fiscal 2024. 
4. For the month of October, Azul's consolidated traffic increased 13.7% year over year. To match the increased 
demand situation, AZUL is expanding its capacity. In the same period, capacity grew 8.4% year over year. Since 
traffic growth was more than capacity expansion, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased 3.9 
percentage points to 81.1% last month. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the 
major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.  
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that the majority of the airline stocks traded in the green over the past week. Consequently, 
the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained 1% to $48.68 over the past week. Over the course of six months, the sector 
tracker decreased 18.3%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will look forward to the third-quarter 2023 
earnings report of Azul, scheduled to be out on Nov 14.

Nov 10, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Azul S.A. AZUL[1] reported double-digit year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for October 2023. 
In October, the Brazilian carrier's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available 
seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 13.7% and 8.4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With 
consolidated passenger traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 81.1% from 77.2% in October 2022. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (7.6%) outpacing available seat kilometers (3.1%), the 
load factor increased to 78.6% from 75.3% in October 2022. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 37.5% and 31.8%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 89.8% from 86.1% in October 2022. 
Azul's chief executive officer, John Rodgerson, stated, In October, passenger demand grew 13.7% outpacing our 
capacity growth as we continue to see a robust demand environment in both domestic and international markets. 
Recent booking trends are strong and we are very excited about the revenue potential for the upcoming months as 
we entered in the seasonally stronger period of the year.' 
Impressive air traffic has led to a 45% year-to-date appreciation in the AZUL stock. This northward movement 
compares favorably with the 4.9% decline recorded by the Zacks Airline[2] industry in the same time frame. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair HoldingsRYAAY[3], a European carrier, also reported impressive traffic numbers for October 2023, driven 
by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in October was 17.1 million, 
implying that 9% more passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) 
came in at 93% in October 2023. RYAAY operated more than 96,700 flights in October 2023. Zacks Rank and 
Stocks to Consider Azul currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[4] sector are Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies 
Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation WAB[5] and SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[6]. Each stock carries a Zacks 
Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 20.99% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.11%, on average. 
AZUL October Passenger Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 11.6% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year 
earnings has improved 18.4% over the past 90 days. Shares of SKYW have surged 160% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.57%, on average.

Following today's interim trading report, Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) retained itscrown as the clear leader 
when it comes to generatingnonticket, ancillary revenues from its passengers.
Ancillary revenues increased by 27.5% to (EURO)1.29 million in the first six months of the year, compared to 
passenger ticket revenues increasing by 49.1% to (EURO)1.76 billion.
Therefore, as a percentage of total revenues, non-ticket sales accounted for 42% of total revenues.
In comparison, budget competitor Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA)'s ancillary revenues comprised29% of its 
(EURO)8.57 billion total revenues in the first half of 2023.
Over at easyJet plc, ancillary revenues for the past financial year totalled just 26% of total group revenues, making 
Hungary's Wizz Air the clear leader of the budget airline pack when it comes to milking passengers for extra costs.
What comprises these ancillary, or non-ticket, sales exactly?
It's a broad church, combining the following:
  
•
Baggage charges  
•
Currency conversion charges  
•
Check-in fees  
•
Priority boarding (inlcuding extended legroom and reserved seats)  
•
Loyalty programme membership fees  
•
On-board refreshments  
Wizz Air leads the airline flock in non-ticket revenues
•
Commissions generated from travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls, car rentals and other ground 
and on-board services
Unfortunately, Wizz Air, nor its competitors, like to itemise these ancillary revenues, so we can't determine how 
much they earn from beer sales, for instance.

Highlight: Ireland-based low-cost airline Ryanair has announced the extension of its partnership with Erasmus 
Student Network (ESN) for the seventh year.
Body
ESN is a Europe-wide organisation that supports students on exchanges around Europe via the European Union's 
Erasmus+ study abroad programme. The partnership is designed to enable low-cost travel for students on 
exchanges through a specialised discount area on the Ryanair website. Eligible students will receive a 10% flight 
discount on four one-way flights per year and a free 20kg checked-in bag with every flight booked. 
The programme, which has been running since 2017, has been successful, with more than 700,000 bookings since 
its inception. Ryanair's head of public affairs, Matthew Krasa, described the benefits for students as "generous." 
Krasa said: "Ryanair is pleased to announce our exclusive partnership with ESN for the seventh year running, 
promoting student mobility by offering third-level [tertiary level education including university and college] students 
across Europe a range of exclusive flight offers, including generous discounts and free-of-charge baggage. "As 
Ryanair continues to grow and invest in Europe, we are delighted to support the EU flagship Erasmus programme 
and the incredible opportunities offered to their student members". The ESN discount will be available during the 
academic year from 1 September to 15 June 2024. According to ESN, financial uncertainty and a lack of financial 
means have been reported as the biggest obstacles to students participating in overseas education. ESN president 
Rita Dias and ESN treasurer Ayberk Yavuz made a joint statement highlighting the importance of the partnership in 
advancing the ESN's commitment to making educational mobility more accessible for students across Europe. Dias 
and Yavuz said: "ESN recognises the value of the partnership with Ryanair in addressing one of the main barriers 
faced by students. Numerous students have encountered difficulties when deciding to undertake a foreign 
exchange programme due to a combination of geographic factors and financial constraints. "Ensuring that this 
opportunity is accessible to a wide range of students is essential for the future of Europe. We thank Ryanair for their 
ongoing commitment to the ESN and for facilitating these opportunities."

Airlines are making huge profits from a global travel boom that's keeping airfares at elevated levels. Travelers are 
asking if the ticket prices will come down. Many others believe they need to be even higher.Life has gotten more 
expensive since the pandemic but few things have risen as much as the price of flying.Anyone who has bought a 
flight in 2023 will know it already but the EU confirmed last month that average airfares across Europe were 
between 20% and 30% higher in summer 2023 compared with 2019.It's a global issue that has been building since 
early 2022. In February 2023, data from aviation analytics company Cirium revealed that average ticket prices for 
hundreds of the world's most popular routes had risen by 27.4% from early 2022, when prices were low as 
pandemic-hit airlines looked to entice travelers back to the skies.Although inflation has soared in many countries 
since then, the increase in airfares when compared with the pre-pandemic period comfortably exceeds national 
rates of inflation during that time.The EU's transport commissioner Adina Valean told the Financial Times this week 
that Brussels was now looking into the issue to find out what is exactly going on in the market and why.Lots of 
reasons have been given by airlines, from surging demand for travel, to disrupted supply chains for everything from 
planes themselves to the seats that fill them.Yet many say high prices for flights are here to stay and that in itself 
need not be a bad thing, given the industry's major carbon footprint.The old chestnuts, demand and supplyThere 
are two major reasons behind the dramatic rise in the price of flights: increased demand and disrupted supply.For 
two years, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the industry. 
With planes grounded around the world, the sector's combined losses in 2020 and 2021 were at least $200 billion 
(€187 billion) according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade body.Just as the pandemic 
brought flights to a dramatic halt, the return to normality has driven a remarkable travel boom. Throughout 2023, 
practically all of the world's major airlines have been posting record profits as they rush to keep up with huge 
demand.Ryanair, Europe's biggest carrier by passenger numbers, said this week it expects to make a record profit 
of up to €2 billion ($2.1 billion) in the current financial year. Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, IAG, Air-France-KLM, 
Emirates and American Airlines are among those who have been posting stellar results this year.IATA said in June 
it expects the airline industry's total revenues to top $800 billion for the first time since 2019. Airlines say that while 
the demand is helping them score record profits, their own lack of capacity has forced them to ramp up prices. 
Supply chain snarls in the sector have led to delays at Airbus and Boeing, who are struggling to meet airlines' 
demands for new planes and parts.Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said this week the delays at the two major aircraft 
makers are a major cause of higher prices. He told investors on a call this week that he expected some airlines to

be forced to slash capacity in 2024 due to supply issues. He expects prices to continue to rise as a result.It's not 
just supply chain troubles either. Airlines are grappling with their own increased costs amid staffing problems at 
airports that have also increased since the pandemic, prompting airport operators to cut capacity.However, 
according to Karolina Wojtal from the EU's European Consumer Centres Network, airlines are themselves allowing 
prices to rise higher than the rate of inflation.The airlines are also automatically pushing up prices with their booking 
systems because people really want to travel again after the coronavirus, she told DW.The question of price-
gouging has been leveled at airlines, with some accusing them of trying to offset the huge losses they suffered 
during the pandemic by overcharging now. Airlines deny it, saying prices are an accurate reflection of the current 
state of the industry.Will airfares ever fall?With the supply chain problems expected to persist for some time, and 
the travel boom showing little sign of abating, prices are not going to fall any time soon.Another issue that could 
further drive up prices in the years ahead is the potential costs for airlines as they turn to costly sustainable aviation 
fuels. The aviation industry has a major carbon footprint and is under pressure to reduce it as soon as 
possible.Willie Walsh, the director-general of IATA, said earlier this year that he expected fares to keep rising over 
the next 15 years due to the higher costs of more sustainable fuels. It will mean higher fares because sustainable 
aviation fuel is more expensive than your traditional jet kerosene. And as we transition to net zero, it is going to cost 
some money, he said.Should airfares be regulated?Environmental groups have argued that higher air travel costs 
could help cut the growth of air traffic and would help to both fund the green transition and reduce emissions in the 
shorter term.Jon Worth, a railway transport analyst based in Germany, says the travel boom of 2023 has also seen 
a huge increase in people opting for less polluting methods of transport, such as rail, but he says something needs 
to be done with prices to discourage excessive travel by plane.We have to ask what sort of price structure would 
make sense with regard to trying to discourage those extremely frequent flyers which make up an enormous 
amount of your airline passengers, he told DW. For him, that means a range of things, from increased taxes on 
kerosene fuel for airplanes to a frequent flyer tax and from increased landing charges for airlines at airports to less 
direct government support for the sector.We all have to fly less and flights have got to be more expensive in the 
medium to long term because that should act as a way of discouraging people from flying so much, he said.In her 
interview with the Financial Times, EU Commissioner Valean said she had no plans to intervene in the aviation 
market but would seek a detailed explanation from airlines about rising airfares.Some governments have sought to 
intervene though. The Italian government announced plans in early September to cap airfares between mainland 
Italy and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia after prices soared in the summer. However, after a fierce backlash from 
airlines, led by Ryanair, the government pulled back.France is looking to set an opposite course. The country's 
transport minister said recently he is seeking support from other EU nations to set minimum prices on flights within 
the EU, to try and help curb emissions. He says a debate is needed on the social and environmental price of a flight 
ticket.Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey

Virgin Atlantic receives UK permit for transatlantic SAF flight
Virgin Atlantic receives UK permit for transatlantic SAF flight

Highlight: Virgin Atlantic has received permission from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to conduct the first 
transatlantic flight using 100% SAF at the end of this month after months of planning.
Body
The airline, owned by British billionaire Richard Branson, will fly the VS100 route from London Heathrow to New 
York JFK on 28 November to test the feasibility of using 100% SAF for long-haul flights, which would provide 
significantly lower emissions compared to normal jet fuel.  CEO Shai Weiss said the CAA's permit marked a key 
milestone for the project: "Getting to this point has been more than a year in the making and taken radical 
collaboration across our consortium partners and government.  "We're committed to using 10% SAF by 2030, but to 
get there, we need the government to support the creation of a UK SAF industry."  The flight, which will be operated 
by a Boeing 787 using a Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine, was first announced in December 2022 after the airline 
was announced as the winner of a UK government competition to receive partial funding for the world-first flight.  
Though the CAA's permit marks a significant step forward for the flight, Virgin Atlantic will now need to apply for 
permission from the Federal Aviation Administration for its arrival in the US and from the Irish Aviation Authority and 
Transport Canada to allow it to pass through Irish and Canadian airspace.  While SAF has already been used in 
many flights around the world, it has mostly been blended with traditional jet fuel, though this is currently limited to a 
maximum 50% blend and the supply chain for the fuel has yet to be scaled up enough for widespread use.  Rohit 
Kumar, assistant vice president of Diversified Industries for credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar, commented on 
the slower rollout of the technology, saying it will take years to be able to implement 100% SAF use on a broad 
scale.  Kumar said: "Technology questions regarding whether modifications to current SAF properties and/or 
existing aircraft will be required remain unanswered at this stage.  "In addition, fuel infrastructure upgrades to 
accommodate 100% SAF might also be required. 
Higher cost of the fuel and production bottlenecks are also material challenges." Despite these concerns, many 
airlines have already been signing significant orders for SAF as a key part of net zero sustainability goals, with 
Ryanair recently purchasing 500t of the fuel from OMV and Emirates agreeing an order for 300,000 gallons with 
Shell Aviation.  The EU also approved SAF targets in recent months, meaning European airports could be bound to 
provide 20% of their fuel as SAF by 2035 and 70% by 2050. The UK has also committed to making it mandatory for 
Virgin Atlantic receives UK permit for transatlantic SAF flight
10% of jet fuel to be produced from sustainable sources by 2030. However, a GlobalData report published this 
month reported that the US was set to become the world leader in SAF production over the next decade, 
forecasting that the country would have a production capacity of 1,200 million gallons per year by 2030.

Nov 08, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Care to share? Last week, AirInsight published an estimate[1] of the value of Airbus's advantage in the single-aisle 
market.\xC2 There were two key numbers: AirInsight estimated Airbus has an average of $2.7m per aircraft delivery 
and that Airbus has, between January 2021 and the end of October 2023, accrued $27Bn in value. 
The data used for this estimate combined AirInsight's delivery tracker and current market values from ch-Aviation. 
The numbers are eye-popping. 
AviationValues,[2] a London-based values and data provider, collaboratively provided a fresh dataset to work with. 
All AviationValues values and data are updated daily. The values are calculated using a sophisticated algorithm that 
translates real transaction pricing into values, supplying a more accurate and detailed view of the delivery picture. 
AirInsight decided to see if there is any appreciable difference. 
Let's lay out the data. AviationValues provided the following table of values and volumes. 
AviationValues 
In our initial estimate, as seen below, we estimated Airbus had a $2.7m value advantage per aircraft delivery, based 
on generic average market value figures, which summed to over $27Bn over the period. 
AirInsight 
Using the same logic but with AviationValues data and values, here's what we have now. The Airbus advantage 
rises to $5.5m per delivery and sums to nearly $32Bn. 
AirInsight AviationValues 
Notice the number of deliveries varies between the two sources. Also, the difference in approach to the MAX 8: 
AviationValues does not assess a value premium to the MAX 8-200 variant on the basis that it accounts for less 
than 10% of the current MAX 8 fleet and is almost exclusively concentrated with one entity (Ryanair). 
In terms of delivery figures, AviationValues numbers are slightly lower for Airbus and slightly higher for Boeing than 
our initial estimate.\xC2 However, the values are averaged across and aggregated from delivery value figures by 
year of delivery. This specificity results in a total accrued value 17% higher than estimates based on generic 
averages. 
The Implications What are the implications of this data? 
Estimating the value of Airbus Single-Aisle Market Advantage
Airbus has, by either data source, a substantial market and financial advantage. The following chart illustrates the 
point.\xC2 Based on AviationValues' cumulative delivery data, Boeing's MAX 8 delivery volumes are leading.\xC2 
But both Airbus models are not far behind, and the A321neo has started to overtake its smaller sibling. 
The financial advantage is fundamentally due to Airbus' dominance of the higher capacity segment: the A321neo 
clearly outperforms the MAX 9 in terms of deliveries, and its competitor, the MAX 10, has not yet been certificated. 
AviationValues assesses approximately $10 million in incremental value per aircraft between the MAX 8 and MAX 9 
or between the A320neo and A321neo. So, for every A321neo Airbus delivers, the revenue advantage widens. 
AirInsight AviationValues 
AirInsight AviationValues 
The two charts help explain why Boeing is anxious to get the MAX 10 certified. Without the MAX 10, Boeing has no 
competitive product to capture a share of the A321neo's market. 
The MAX 10 is the MAX model with the second highest orders after the MAX 8, so there is apparent demand for a 
competing high-capacity Boeing single-aisle product. But Boeing must bring the MAX 10 to market first before it can 
crystallise that interest. 
And in the meantime, Airbus is not standing still, with the more capable A321neo LR variant in service and the XLR 
nearing certification. At present, the A321neo backlog alone is larger than the backlog for Boeing's entire MAX 
family, which means Boeing has some significant catching up to do. 
The interest in high-capacity single aisles like the MAX 10 and A321neo highlights a potential issue - what happens 
to MAX 9 values and demand? Will it be squeezed on either end? That's going to be one to watch. 
The data suggests that Airbus enjoys a tremendous market advantage in the single-aisle segment.\xC2 
AviationValues' fleet and values data shows this is mainly due to the success of the A321neo: Airbus has been able 
to capitalise on a market need in that segment, and Boeing has not. 
This advantage is already worth about $30Bn.\xC2 To put that number in perspective, $30Bn could fund a new 
aircraft program. At present, the A321neo backlog alone is larger than the backlog for Boeing's entire MAX family, 
so barring some unforeseen event that suddenly tips the scales in Boeing's favour, we would expect this advantage 
to persist for some time even after the MAX 10 enters service.

On The Beach OTA Secures £2 Million in Landmark Refund Case Against Ryanair
On The Beach OTA Secures £2 Million in Landmark Refund Case Against

In a landmark legal victory, Manchester-based online travel agency (OTA) On The Beach (OTB), alongside affiliated 
entities Sunshine Co. UK. Limited and Classic Package Holidays Limited, has won over £2 million (USD 2.47 
million) in a refunds case against Ryanair Holdings. This case, involving the refusal of Ryanair to provide refunds 
for flights canceled during the pandemic, has set a legal precedent concerning the rights of package holiday 
organizers to seek reimbursements from airlines.
Judge Nigel Cooper of the UK High Court delivered the decision on October 31, 2023. The dispute centered around 
Ryanair's contention that OTAs had no legal entitlement to claim refunds for flights canceled during the pandemic. 
The court ruling establishes that online travel agents, including On The Beach, are legitimate agents acting on 
behalf of their clients.
On The Beach and its affiliated entities claimed and won a total of £2,074,674 for the flight component of package 
holidays in which they had booked a Ryanair flight on behalf of clients. Despite paying Ryanair for the flights, the 
airline later canceled or made significant changes to the flight times. Ryanair refused to refund the OTAs, leading to 
the legal dispute.
The court clarified the legal framework by relying on regulation 29 of the Package Travel Regulations 2018, 
providing a "right to redress" for package organizers against third parties causing them loss. Additionally, the law of 
unjust enrichment grants package organizers the right to claim a contribution from third parties whose liability to 
refund the customer is extinguished by a payment made by the package organizer.
Fox Williams, representing On The Beach, stated that the ruling clarifies the law and is expected to open the door 
for similar claims in the future. Shaun Morton, Chief Executive of On the Beach, welcomed the judgment and called 
for a review of anti-competitive behavior by certain low-cost airlines, emphasizing the importance of consumer 
choice and fair access to flights.
The legal victory, while concluding a protracted and costly process, underscores the significance of establishing 
legal precedents that protect the rights of package organizers and consumers in the evolving landscape of travel 
regulations. On The Beach intends to apply for costs in the aftermath of this ruling.

Since 2008, the low-cost airline has returned more than (EURO)6bn to shareholders through buybacks and special 
dividends. From 2025, it will pay a quarter of the previous year's profit after tax as an ordinary dividend. Ryanair is 
expanding its aircraft fleet to hit a target of 300mn passengers a year by 2034, up from 169mn.
In the past decade, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has undergone an image change. The airline boss has stopped 
insulting passengers and has adopted a more conciliatory tone in his public appearances.
Now Ryanair is maturing financially as well. It will pay a regular dividend for the first time from next year. Ryanair is 
no longer a mouthy upstart but a cash-generative incumbent with relatively low debt.
But do not expect Ryanair to give up its position as the industry's disrupter-in-chief entirely.
Ryanair's coming-of-age should not come as a shock. The business has weathered the pandemic years better than 
rivals. A strong recovery in European air travel has meant that free cash flow, negative in 2021, rebounded to 
(EURO)2bn last year.
Consumers have prioritised holidays despite tight budgets. This has allowed
Ryanair to increase average fares 24 per cent in the first half to offset higher fuel costs, and has freed it to prioritise 
debt repayment. Previously, Ryanair preferred to return excess cash via buybacks and special dividends. That ad 
hoc approach makes less sense now that M&A is less likely.
Ryanair : victor mature Twitter : @FTLEX
Ryanair will pay an ordinary dividend of (EURO)400mn in two parts next year. Thereafter it has committed to pay 25 
per cent of the previous year's profit after tax, a payout worth just under (EURO)500mn for 2025.
Cash flow this year will be crimped by paying for the remaining 737-8200 aircraft Ryanair has ordered from Boeing. 
Delivery began in 2021. Capex should dip in 2025 before Ryanair starts paying towards its most recent order for 
Max-10 jets. These should be delivered from 2027. The intervening capex holiday could inspire further buybacks.
Ryanair shares have outperformed European rivals this year yet trade on a forward price-earnings multiple of about 
nine times compared with about 14 times pre-pandemic.
Airlines are always vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and consumer downturns. But with a strong balance sheet and 
cost base at least 50 per cent lower than rivals, middle-aged Ryanair should still demonstrate the vigour of a much 
younger airline.

Ryanair's share price can rise by more than 50% , according to JP Morgan, which rates the airline as "extremely 
attractive".
On a short-term view, there is potential for earnings momentum to keep rising while longer-term Ryanair's cost 
advantage over peers will show through, says the bank.
In the second quarter results, out yesterday, yield strength far exceeded JP Morgan's expectations, which bodes 
well for the sector amid concerns that air travel spend could come under pressure.
Winter guidance looked relatively conservative given that implied fourth-quarter losses of around the level seen 
duringCOVID-19.
Finally, the year to March 2025 could see a big step-up in net income on alleviated fuel and ex-fuel cost pressure 
alone, even if fares finally begin to step down, JP Morgan believes.
The bank's share price target rises to (EURO)25 or 56% above the market level.

Body
Belavia, the Belarus flag carrier, has been operating while restricted by sanctions for more than two years but 
remains financially stable, according to its CEO. The airline was hit by sanctions stemming from the actions of the 
Minsk Government in 2021, including the forced landing of a Ryanair jet, which were later extended when President 
Lukashenko supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The European Union banned Russian and 
Belarusian planes from its airspace, which severely restricted Bealvia's route options. 
The airline has pivoted heavily towards former Soviet states and the Middle East. The anti-war sanctions have 
restricted trade with companies in Russia and Belarus, which has created stock issues for Belavia. Although the 
airline operates Boeing and Embraer jets, sanctions mean the companies have stopped servicing and parts 
supplies. This has both increased costs for the airline and forced it to look elsewhere for its next fleet upgrade. 
Belavia CEO Igor Cherginets said: "We are preparing agreements with United Aircraft Corporation for the purchase 
of MS-21 and Superjet New." "I very much hope that this will be the case and that we can expand the airline's fleet," 
he added. But before the renewal can be finalised, spares and repair costs have escalated. "Our spending on 
components has practically tripled," Cherginets explained. Despite the increased costs and restrained income from 
fewer flight operations, Cherginets told a press conference in Minsk the airline is not losing money. "We work 
profitably and, unlike Russian companies, do not receive any subsidies," he told local media.

Ryanair forecast a record annual profit and outlined plans to pay a regular dividend for the first time as it cashed in 
on its busiest summer and a rise in airfares.
Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers yesterday forecast a fullyear net profit of between (EURO)1.85bn 
and (EURO)2.05bn for its financial year ending in March, which would beat a record set in 2018.
The carrier became the latest to report booming profits over the summer as the industry rebounded from the 
pandemic thanks to strong demand and high ticket prices.
Rivals including British Airways owner IAG, easyJet and Air France-KLM have all reported record summer earnings 
in recent weeks.
Ryanair announced plans to pay shareholders a regular dividend for the first time, starting with (EURO)400mn over 
the next year. It pledged to then return about 25 per cent of the previous-year profit after tax to shareholders. The 
airline paid more than (EURO)6bn to shareholders between 2008 and 2020, but only through buybacks or special 
dividends.
Ryanair plans to pay regular dividend Airlines Carrier is latest to post summer earnings surge as sector 
bounces back
Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, said that the switch to regular payouts reflected the "maturity" of Ryanair's 
business, following years of high capital spending before the pandemic as it built its position in the European 
market.
As carriers across Europe report record profits, the biggest question facing the industry is how long the boom can 
continue, and whether demand for travel will remain strong into next year.
Sorahan said Christmas looked "strong" and the airline was "pleased" with early sales for summer 2024.
But Ryanair warned that its financial guidance was "highly dependent on the absence of any unforeseen adverse 
events", like those in Ukraine or Gaza.
The airline said it faced a "significantly" higher fuel bill - up (EURO)1.3bn this financial year. That meant it was 
unlikely to replicate last year's "bumper" fiscal third quarter.
Ryanair said it faced higher environmental EU charges from January and delivery delays for aircraft from Boeing.
Ryanair carried 105.4mn passengers between April and September, a record for the summer season.Net profit for 
the period rose 59 per cent compared with the previous year to (EURO)2.18bn, as average fares rose by nearly a 
quarter.
Airlines have been able to raise fares in Europe as strong demand for leisure travel has come amid a capacity 
crunch, and the industry still has fewer planes in the air than before the pandemic after retiring many jets during the 
coronavirus crisis.
Airbus and Boeing have suffered from delays in producing new aircraft, while some airlines have had to take their 
existing jets out of service because of a product recall from engine maker Pratt & Whitney.
Sorahan said he expected airfares to stay high into next summer because of the imbalance between supply and 
demand in the industry. "Capacity is going to remain constrained for some time to come ... I think it leads to higher 
fares for the next while and potentially into next summer." See Lex

Sky-high fares Brussels looks at surge in flight prices

Brussels is probing the recent rise in air fares across Europe after airlines pushed up prices by as much as 30 per 
cent over the summer, leading to bumper profits.
Adina Valean, the EU's transport commissioner, told the Financial Times that EU officials were "looking into detail ... 
of what is exactly going on in the market and why".
The European Commission does not have the power to regulate air fares but Valean's intervention adds to pressure 
on airlines over the recent price rises, triggered by a travel boom and supply chain issues. She said she was 
seeking explanations from airlines about the rise in fares and the potential barriers to connectivity in the bloc.
Average air fares across Europe were between 20 and 30 per cent higher over summer 2023 compared with 2019, 
according to EU data released in October in response to a question in the European parliament.
Valean said she had no plans to intervene in the "functioning" aviation market but the commission needed more 
details of the industry dynamics that had led to the higher prices.
"We are still investigating because we don't have a full, detailed explanation," she said, particularly on whether the 
fare rises were a long-term trend.
Brussels is concerned that high air fares could affect the EU's outer regions, such as islands or isolated territories 
that rely on aviation for connections with the rest of the bloc.
Sky-high fares Brussels looks at surge in flight prices
"We cannot go as a regulator into micromanagement of prices or imposing that, I don't think this is doable or 
desirable," Valean said. "On the other hand, what I as a regulator worry [about] is that a price [could] become a 
barrier for connectivity.
"We are in a permanent conversation with the industry ... to understand what the cause of this development is."
Valean's intervention adds to political pressure on airlines over rising fares. The Italian government has proposed 
capping prices on routes to some islands, but partially backtracked in September and instead gave the country's 
competition authority new powers to police ticket prices.
Airlines are free to set their own fares under EU laws, and the liberalised air market has historically driven down 
prices and opened new routes. But a surge in demand for flights has this year, amid a shortage of aircraft, drove up 
ticket prices.
Many airlines retired planes during the coronavirus pandemic, while supply chain problems hit deliveries and 
inflationary pressures across fuel and labour also pushed up costs.
While ultra low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air are flying more than in 2019, most European airlines are not.
Airlines including British Airways owner IAG, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa still reported record profits over the 
summer, helped by rising fares, partly repairing the damage to their balance sheets from the pandemic. The global 
industry has more than doubled its profit forecast for the year, according to the sector's trade body, as a result of 
surging post-pandemic demand.
Valean said she feared higher prices would continue because of the imbalance between demand for travel and tight 
supply of new aircraft. "We do expect that capacity is not going to grow at the same level as the demand."
Airlines also face paying a higher price to pollute after member states and the European parliament last December 
agreed rules that will speed up the phasing out of free carbon credits given to airlines under the bloc's emissions 
trading system and require the industry to report on non-CO2 emissions too.
Airline bosses have said they broadly support the EU's climate targets but said they need more support if they are 
to cut emissions, particularly in the development of sustainable aviation fuels.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) on Monday advised Prime Minister Rishi Sunak against interfering in the airline industry's 
practice of advertising a low price, which excludes the use of services such as seat reservations and overhead 
storage. 
The UK government is poised to roll out plans to curb such pricing methods in King Charles III's speech on

were once a part of standard airfares, but make the charges more transparent to customers.

PostNL fell sharply following a "tough quarter", admitted chief executive Herna Verhagen, who warned that full-year 
earnings would now be at the lower end of the Dutch postal group's guidance.
Verhagen said parcel volumes "grew at a lower rate than anticipated", which contributed to a normalised operating 
loss of (EURO)11mn in the quarter - way worse than the (EURO)3mn profit expected by analysts.
Ryanair rallied on plans to pay a regular dividend for the first time, with the budget airline unveiling a maiden payout 
of (EURO)0.35 per share for its fiscal 2024 year.
For subsequent financial years, it set out a dividend policy with a payout ratio of 25 per cent.
This came on the back of "record summer traffic and higher fares, which offset significantly higher fuel costs", said 
the group, which forecast an annual profit of (EURO)1.85bn to (EURO)2.05bn - markedly higher than RBC Europe's 
(EURO)1.84bn estimate.

Topping the FTSE 100 index was Melrose Industries, which announced that it had signed a "major new agreement" 
with GE Aerospace, the engines maker.
The former turnaround specialist, which was now an aerospace company, said it expected total sales from this deal 
to be about $5bn during the 30-year span of GENX, a jet engine found on Boeing's wide-body aircraft.
Sam Burgess, an analyst at Citi, estimated the value of this deal to be around 15p to 25p per share, assuming 
revenue was "spread evenly" over three decades.
In the top half of the FTSE 250 mid-cap index was budget airline easyJet, which rallied on the back of a bullish 
trading update by rival Ryanair.
Music rights owner Hipgnosis retreated on announcing that it would not be paying dividends for the rest of its 
financial year.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Hipgnosis made this move because it needed "to set aside cash to

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary has blamed delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus for hiking air fares 
across Europe.
O'Leary told analysts on a conference call that capacity constraints caused by supply chain issues at the 
planemakers would "underpin strong pricing."
"Even if consumer demand is challenged, there will be less capacity than there was pre-Covid and I think the price 
of that capacity will be higher," he said.
"We've certainly seen that amongst the legacy airlines in Europe," he explained, with Air France-KLM and the IAG 
"materially increasing air fares" in recent years.
Ryanair has jostled with the planemaker over long delivery times in the past, but tensions have cooled since it 
placed a colossal £31.7bn order for 300 Boeing 737 Max 10 jets in May.
O'Leary added that "both Airbus and Boeing are running materially behind because of supply chain challenges."
O'Leary's comments come off the back of the announcement of Ryanair's maiden dividend for shareholders 
following a £1.8bn half-year profit.
The ordinary dividend of (EURO)400m will be split between an initial payment of (EURO)200m in February and a 
final dividend of (EURO)200m in September 2024.

Good morning from London where the FTSE 100 is off to a steady start to the week so far, as investors continue to 
mull last week's interest rate pauses by central banks.
London's blue-chip index is virtually unchanged from Friday at around 7,420 points with a bullish update from 
Ryanair the only real standout. The low-cost airline is to pay its first ever dividend after half-year profits hit nearly 
(EURO)2.2bn. The (EURO)400m payout amounts to a quarter of annual profits buoyed by an 11% rise in 
passengers and higher fare prices.
Elsewhere, Tech investor Scottish Mortgage Trust's net asset value fell in the first half of the year but said it is still 
backing its strategy in the long-term. Insurer Prudential's sales stormed ahead in its latest quarter with new 
business up 37% on higher Asian demand for life insurance, health insurance and pensions. It says momentum has 
continued into the fourth quarter.
In small caps, 88 Energy is claiming some 250 million barrels of contingent oil equivalent resources in one reservoir 
in Alaska, where the company is working on developing what it calls Project Phoenix.
And fellow oil & gas junior Plexus meanwhile has seen a 20% jump in its share price this morning as it revealed 
more orders for its well-head technology.
Those are the main points so far but stay tuned throughout the day for all the latest news as it happens.

3:54pm: British Steel to shut Scunthorpe blast furnaces
British Steel has announced a £1.25 billion plan to replace two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, in a move that would 
further reshape the UK steel industry and could eventually threaten the jobs of up to 2,000 steelworkers.
FTSE 100 Live: Blue-chips end subdued session little changed
The company, owned by China's Jingye, on Monday informed workers that it proposed to replace the blast furnaces 
with greener electric arc models, rejecting the possibility of capturing the carbon in a blow to thenascent British 
carbon capture industry.
Under the proposals, the two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, in North Lincolnshire, would be replaced by an electric 
arc furnace at Scunthorpe and another at a site in Teesside, North Yorkshire.
3:21pm: Jefferies lifts StanChart price target
Heading towards the close and the FTSE 100 remains just the right side of the line, up 4points at 7.422.
Melrose Industries remains the top riser afterits dealwith GE Aerospace, closely followed by Standard Chartered 
PLC (LSE:STAN), up 2.7%.
Jefferies has increased its price target to 1,100p from 1,020p and reiterated a buy rating.
The broker pointed out the Asia-focused bank's share price hit a 52-week low on Friday, which doesn't compute 
against an absence of downgrade's to 2024& 2025E numbers and Jefferies newly increased buyback estimates to 
$2.5 billion/year, implying total return of 35% of current market cap through 2025E.
The broker believes StanChart is capable of delivering 12% return on total equity (ROTE) against 0.5x TBV.
The path to value creation lies in executing on its projected 12% ROTE, delivering capital repatriation (dividend 
plusbuybacks) of $7.0 billion and effective communication of the company's investment case, the broker feels.
2:43pm: Wall Street opens on the front foot
It's been a steady start in the US where investors continue to bet on a soft economic landing and hope interest 
rates have peaked.
Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up86.54 points, 0.3%, at 34,147.86, the S&P 
500 was up7.48 points, 0.2%, at 4,365.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was up36.53 points, 0.3%, at13,514.81.
Craig Erlam at Oanda said: "Investors got everything they wanted from the Federal Reserve and the jobs report."
"Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues adopted a slightly less hawkish tone for the meeting while maintaining its 
extremely cautious position on inflation and interest rates."
Shares in WeWork were halted for trading early on Monday, as Wall Street anticipated an imminent bankruptcy 
filing of the flexible working space company once valued at $47 billion.
The company, founded by Adam Neumann and backed with billions of capital from SoftBank, had previously 
announced it would not make an interest payment due to bondholders as it negotiated a comprehensive 
restructuring of $13 billion in lease obligations.

2:14pm: Next cut but Dunelm raised as RBC rejigs retailers
RBC Capital Markets has rejigged ratings of two retailers, with Next PLC (LSE:NXT) downgraded and Dunelm 
heading the other way.
"We continue to view Next as a blue-chip UK consumer proxy offering longer-term growth potential from its Total 
Platform."
FTSE 100 Live: Blue-chips end subdued session little changed
"However, we see more valuation upside for some other retailers, hence we have downgraded our rating to sector 
perform, the broker said.
RBC sees the Leicester-based retailer as being relatively exposed to higher interest rates and softer employment 
trends in the UK, given it generates over 85% of its sales here.
"We do see Next as more exposed to the lagged impact of higher interest rates, given its relatively high exposure to 
the 30-50 age group, where average spend on mortgages is highest," it said.
As such we expect Next's underlying sales performance to be more in line with the market next year, particularly as 
benefits from less competition in the midmarket are in the base.
It has cut its pre-tax profit forecasts for by 1-2% and lowered its price target to 7,700p from 8,000p.
It sees more valuation upside for some other stocks such as AB Foods, Boss and B&M European Value Retail.
RBC upgraded Dunelm to sector perform, pointing out it is trading towards the lower end of its historical valuation 
range.
"We view this as fair given Dunelm's well-managed, cash generative model, albeit a relatively challenging outlook 
for home related sales," it said.
Shares in Next are down 1.1% while Dunelm is also lower, down 0.2%.
Elsewhere, JD Sports Fashion is up 1.2% after Citi initiated coveragewith a buy rating.

Shares of Aptamer Group PLC (AIM:APTA) fell 11%, despite the company's announcement of operational progress 
and strategic advancements under its new management team.
A recent lull in customer confidence preceding a £3.6 million fundraise led to a temporary revenue shortfall 
compared to the previous year.
Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited (LSE:SONG) slipped another 5% as it warned there would be no dividend this year 
due to a need to build up cash buffers to pay bigger-than-expected sums to its artists.

million across three tranches.
12:35pm: Ex-NatWest boss gets an apology
Britain's Information Commissioner has apologised to former NatWest CEO Dame Alison Rose, for suggesting she 
had breached data protection rules over the debanking scandal involving Nigel Farage.
Last month,an ICO reportsaid that Rose had broken data protection rules, first by revealing to the BBC that Farage 
had a banking relationship with its private bank, Coutts; and secondly by providing "misleading information" that led 
the BBC to believe the bank was closing his accounts for purely commercial reasons, linked to his wealth.
The UK Information Commissioner's Officesaidit had incorrectly given the impression that it had examined the 
actions ofAlison Rose, when it was NatWest that was under investigation.
The agency said its investigation did not find that Rose had breached data protection law when she discussed the 
closing ofNigel Farage's bank account with a reporter, and said it regretted giving the impression that she had.
11:55am: US markets expected to open slightly higher
US stocks are expected to make steady progress on Monday as investors mull the implications of last week's 
interest rate decision and weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls.
In pre-market trading, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1%, while those for the S&P 500 
were 0.2% higher, and contracts for the Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.
Joshua Mahony at Scope Markets said: "US markets look set for tentative gains at the open, with all eyes on big 
tech after a dramatic surge for the Nasdaq last week."
"With markets now pricing in a lower chance of additional tightening from the Fed, we have seen both big tech 
(Nasdaq) and small caps (Russell 2000) outperform."
"This week marks a significant cooling off period as the influence of earnings and economic data releases start to 
fade."
"With that in mind, the price action seen this week should provide a good temperature check for markets having 
seen central banks and the vast majority of Q3 earnings reported."
Tesla rose after it said it will produce a new model that will cost (EURO)25,000 at its factory near Berlin, according 
to Reuters.
Chief Executive Elon Muskannounced the plan to staff last week when he visited the Tesla factory in Gruenheide, 
Reuters said Monday, citing an unnamed source.
11:19am: Analysts upbeat on Prudential despite third quarter slowdown
Prudential PLC (LSE:PRU)'s shares have slipped 0.8% to 892.60p after its third quarter trading update showed a 
slowdown in new business during the quarter.
AJ Bell's Russ Mould explained "there are signs the unsettled Chinese economy and market are starting to weigh 
on the company."
FTSE 100 Live: Blue-chips end subdued session little changed
But he said "the challenges should be kept in perspective."
"Consumer demand has remained resilient for now andPrudentialstill operates in immature markets with more 
significant growth potential than those targeted by counterparts operating in the West."
At Jefferies, analysts noted domestic Hong Kong new business profit grew by a double-digit amount, suggesting 
thatPrudentialis taking share, probably from Manulife and FWD, whose share has been falling.
"Mainland Chinese APE fell as expected, due to strong prior year bancassurance sales and diversification ahead of 
regulatory changes", it pointed out.
UBS highlighted growth trends appear to have declined marginally versus the first half update, where growth of 
37% (APE) was reported,versus 34% growth in the third quarter.
The new business margin at 47% was also lower than the 49% reported at the half-way stage.
But Bank of America felt there was a continuation of the trends seen at the half-year "which should be a relief."
"We think momentum is building for Pru and think the shares do not reflect the company's long-term growth 
potential," it said.
Mainland China sales slowed again due to regulatory changes, which should not be a surprise, but other ASEAN 
businesses picked up the slack, it pointed out.
UBS, Jefferies and Bank of America rate Prudential at buy.
10:47am: Ocado has turned a corner, says BofA
Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO) has "turned a corner," with the risk/reward "skewed to the upside" and significant 
opportunities in the non-grocery market.
That is the view of analysts at Bank of America which reinstated coverage of the online food retailer today with a 
buy rating and 850p price target, offering 57% upside from current levels.
The investment bank thinks both Ocado Retail and Ocado Technology Solutions are at a positive inflection point as 
online penetration rises and inflation fades.
E-commerce penetration is now rising after two years of continuous decline, which should incentivise grocers to 
invest again in their online fulfilment capabilities, BofA thinks, with . Ocado Technology Solutions best positioned to 
meet that demand.
It sees potential for a further 30 customer fulfilment centres on top of the current pipeline for 60 which BofA believes 
backs the group's key financial targets for 2026-28.
"Next up, Ocado is entering the non-grocery market, where its tech is easily transferrable: we think this is a £55 
billion opportunity in the UK alone - 2.5x bigger than grocery," the bank said.
"Overall, we believe Ocado's existing operations support the group market valuation, and we would expect any new 
deal - in grocery or beyond - to act as a positive catalyst for the shares," the bank said in a research note.
Shares are up 0.6% at 545.20p, off an earlier high of 577p.
10:26am: Construction decline shows impact of rate rises
Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks the latest construction PMI data shows the adverse impact of 
the rise in interest rates on construction activity "now that the backlog of work that built up in the wake of the 
pandemic has been fully depleted."
FTSE 100 Live: Blue-chips end subdued session little changed
He noted the "silver lining" for construction firms, however, is that supply-side constraints have continued to ease, 
with subcontractor availability improving for the 12th consecutive month and suppliers' delivery times shortening for 
the 8th consecutive month in October.
He said that the construction PMI is consistent with the official measure of output falling at a 1% quarter-on-quarter 
pace.
10:05am: Construction contracts once more amid housebuilding slump
The UK construction sector picked up slightly in October but remained in decline amid a further slump in 
housebuilding.
The latest S&P Global/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction purchasing managers' index rose 
to 45.6 points in October, from 45.0 in September, the second-lowest reading since May 2020.
The survey showed "challenging" business conditions persisted during October, with business activity falling for the 
second month running amid a lack of new work to replace completed projects.
"House building decreased for the eleventh successive month in October and at a much steeper pace than 
elsewhere in the construction sector (index at 38.5)," S&P Global said.
"Falling work on residential construction projects was widely linked to a lack of demand and subsequent cutbacks to 
new projects," the survey reported.
Civil engineering activity also decreased sharply in October (index at 43.7) and the rate of decline was the fastest 
since July 2022.
Meanwhile, there were signs of stabilisation in the commercial; building segment, with activity falling only marginally 
and at a slower pace than in September (index at 49.5).
Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: "October data highlighted another solid 
reduction in UK construction output as elevated borrowing costs and a wait-and-see approach to new projects 
weighed on activity."
Dr John Glen, Chief Economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: "There is no doubt 
that UK construction is in a difficult period and there will likely be further challenging months to come."
9:44am: RyanAir results beat forecasts
Peel Hunt said RyanAir's second quarter exceeded its forecasts due to higher average fares, which increased 29% 
to (EURO)65.45, ahead of its (EURO)64.26 estimate.
As a result, scheduled revenues were (EURO)3,600 million compared to its (EURO)3,534 million prediction.
Ancillary revenues were (EURO)7 million less than it expected, as were operating costs, due to lower fuel over the 
quarter, giving operating profit of (EURO)1,705 million, growth of 20%, and ahead of its (EURO)1,607 million 
forecast.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment, interactive investor explained: "Ryanairhas been able to pass on additional 
cost pressures to consumers through higher airfares with ticket prices likely to continue to go up next year."
"Plus, it has been enjoying a tailwind from strong demand post pandemic which it expects will be even stronger next 
year, despite cost-of-living pressures with elevated inflation and interest rates."
She pointed out Ryanairhas also been more focussed than rivals on keeping its debt down and the airline expects it 
will be debt-free by the end of 2026.
FTSE 100 Live: Blue-chips end subdued session little changed
"Investors have lots to be cheerful about in this set of results including its better-than-expected earnings, its outlook, 
and its dividend announcement," she added.

The FTSE 100-listed firm expects the deal to boost GKN Aerospace sales by around $5 billion over the full 30 year 
life of the GEnx engine.
The benefits will read through significantly in the medium term from GEnx aftermarket activities and as new GKN 
technology enters the GE engine fleet, it said, adding "there is no material change to short-term guidance."

following increases in passenger fares.
Europe's largest discount airline said it plans to hand over about a quarter of its annual profits to shareholders after 
benefitting from a record summer of passenger traffic.
The airline forecast a full-year profit after tax of between (EURO)1.85 billion to (EURO)2.05 billion for its financial 
year ending in March, which would be a record.
It said it will pay a dividend of (EURO)400 million and plans to give around a quarter of its annual profit to 
shareholders in its financial first-half results, along with a pledge to consider special dividends and share buybacks 
in the future.
Ryanair carried 105.4 million passengers between April and September, another record for the summer season.

economic updates.

at17,939.62.
Equities rallied last week on hopes that interest rates have peaked and for a soft economic landing in the US.
Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said: "The fascinating thing about markets is that the path to a hard landing is often via 
the appearance of a soft landing first."
"So we're in this window where the data is softening but if it only ends up softens a bit, and then stabilising, then its 
great news."
"However if it's the start of something bigger it's not," he noted, adding "the former scenario won out last week."
On a quiet morning for company news, Prudential fell 2.0% despite a strong trading update.
The Asia-focused insurer said in the first nine months to end-September, new business profitwas up 37% to $2,143

strategy.

Ryanair Declares Maiden Ordinary Dividend as Interim Earnings Surge on Record Summer Traffic
Ryanair Declares Maiden Ordinary Dividend as Interim Earnings Surge on 
Record Summer Traffic

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) will pay shareholders a first-time ordinary dividend in fiscal 2024 after its profit for the fiscal first 
half surged on the back of record traffic in the peak summer months, according to a Monday business update. 
The Irish budget airline's board intends to pay a dividend of 0.35 euro per share for fiscal 2024, to be distributed 
through equal interim and final dividends payable in February 2024 and September 2024, respectively. Meanwhile, 
from fiscal 2025 onward, the company aims to return 25% of its prior-year profit after tax to shareholders in the form 
of ordinary dividends. 
The payout was backed by a significant jump in Ryanair's attributable profit to 2.18 billion euros in the six months 
ended Sept. 30 from 1.26 billion euros in the prior year. Total operating revenue also swelled to 8.58 billion euros 
from 6.62 billion euros.
The interim earnings boost was triggered by an 11% annual growth in traffic to 105.4 million passengers, mainly 
due to strong demand during Easter in the first quarter and a summer traffic surge. The 24% increase in average 
fares also contributed to higher revenue during the period. 
For fiscal 2024, the airline continues to target 9% growth in traffic to 183.5 million passengers, with profit after tax 
estimated in the range of 1.85 billion euros to 2.05 billion euros. However, the guidance remains subject to any 
unforeseen adverse events until the end of March 2024.
Ryanair also updated its environmental targets and invested heavily in efficient technology to make progress toward 
its climate targets. "In H1 we took delivery of 26, new, B737-8200 "Gamechangers" (4% more seats, 16% less fuel 
& CO2). We're accelerating the retrofit of scimitar winglets to almost 130 B737NGs (target 409 by 2026), reducing 
fuel burn by 1.5% and lowering noise emissions by a further 6%," Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary noted. 
Shares in Ryanair were up 5% Monday morning.

Ryanair Rewards Shareholders After Profit Soars

November 6th, 2023 ( International Business Times News  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair on Monday announced the start of regular dividends to shareholders after net profit 
surged 72 percent in its first half on higher fares and record traffic.
Profit after tax came in at 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in the six months to the end of September year-on-year, 
Ryanair said in a statement.
The Dublin-headquartered airline said it would begin regular dividend payments for the first time in its history.
It comes as the aviation sector is enjoying a strong recovery after suffering heavy losses at the start of the decade 
when the Covid pandemic grounded flights worldwide.
"We want to thank those shareholders for their support during a very difficult Covid period," Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said.
The carrier announced "a maiden ordinary dividend of 400 million euros" spread across two equal payments in 
February and September next year.
In the years ahead, Ryanair said it expects to pay about 25 percent of net profits in dividends.
The dividend announcements, along with expectations of record-high annual profits despite a number of 
headwinds, helped send Ryanair's share price rallying six percent to 16.12 euros in Dublin.
Ryanair has previously paid out a total of 6.74 billion euros in share buybacks and ad hoc dividends in the 12 years 
to 2020, the company confirmed to AFP.
O'Leary added that the carrier's full-year outlook "remains highly dependent on the absence of any unforeseen 
adverse events -- for example such as Ukraine or Gaza -- between now and the end of March".
Ryanair profits ballooned in the first half "thanks to a strong Easter in the first quarter, record summer traffic and 
higher fares which offset significantly higher fuel costs", the company statement said.
Ryanair Rewards Shareholders After Profit Soars
Traffic grew 11 percent to 105 million passengers and average fares jumped by almost one quarter.
O'Leary said the company expects record full-year net profit of between 1.85 billion euros and 2.05 billion euros -- a 
forecast that assumes "modest losses" over the winter.
He added that the outlook was clouded by uncertainty over the delivery of new Boeing planes, "a significantly 
higher full-year fuel bill, very limited fourth-quarter visibility and the risk of weaker consumer spending over coming 
months".
US planemaker Boeing last month reported another hefty loss as it trimmed its full-year forecast for deliveries of the 
737 to address a manufacturing problem on the aircraft.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a half-year profit rise and outlined ordinary dividend 
policy plans, which will kick off with a maiden EUR400 million payout. 
The dividend outlook came in its first-half results, which showed revenue jumped 30% on-year in the six months to 
September 30 to EUR8.58 billion from EUR6.62 billion. Profit after tax, before one-offs, surged 59% to EUR2.18 
billion from EUR1.37 billion. Pretax profit rose at the same pace to EUR2.46 billion from EUR1.42 billion.
"Ryanair Holdings reported a strong half-year profit... thanks to a strong Easter in the first quarter, record summer 
traffic and higher fares which offset significantly higher fuel costs," the company statement said Monday.
Traffic grew 11% to 105 million passengers, while average fares jumped by almost one quarter.
Ryanair still targets full-year traffic of 183.5 million passengers. It expects profit after tax of EUR1.85 billion to 
EUR2.05 billion. 
Ryanair declared a maiden ordinary dividend of EUR400 million, some EUR0.35 per share, though an interim and 
final dividend of EUR200 million each. These will payable in February and September of next year.
"Ryanair's shareholders invested EUR400 million in a share placing during the peak of the Covid crisis in 
September 2020, which was key to Ryanair subsequently issuing a timely, low cost, EUR850 million bond, which 
helped the group emerge from the Covid pandemic in a position of unrivalled strategic and financial strength," the 
firm said.
For subsequent financial years, Ryanair will return about 25% of profit after tax, adjusted for non-recurring gains or 
losses, through ordinary dividends. 
UPDATE: Ryanair sets out dividend plans as half-year profit jumps
In addition, Ryanair said it will "will retain the flexibility to consider, when or if appropriate, the return of surplus cash 
to shareholders through special dividends and/or share buybacks".

(Alliance News) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday announced that net profit surged 72% in its first

year ending in March, which would be a record.

Ryanair's bullish update had very little to find fault with, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.
Second quarter net profit was 2% above consensus and 7% higher than the broker expected due to strong 
revenues.
Net cash was lower than expected at (EURO)844 million due to a material working capital outflow, but other than 
that there was much to like, suggests the bank.
Third-quarter average fares are expected to again be up by a 'mid-teens percentage' year-on-year, while the guide 
is for a full-year net profit of (EURO)1.85bn to (EURO)2.05bn.
The mid-point of (EURO)1.95bn is 7% above Bloomberg's consensus and 20% higher than Deutsche Bank's.
A maiden (EURO)400m dividend plus the promise of future returns equal to 25% of after-tax profit as a dividend 
plus specials and buybacks if appropriate.
Buy is the rating with a (EURO)21 share price target against (EURO)16.24, up 7% today.

Highlight: The FTSE 100 was steady this morning after rising on the back of interest rate pauses last week, with 
airlines gaining altitude after Ryanair announced its first ever dividend.
Body
The FTSE 100 was steady on Monday following a busy week of interest rate calls, with airlines flying higher 
after Ryanair (RYA) announced it will pay its first ever dividend. 
The main market was flat at 7,417 after a strong performance last week on the back of interest rate pauses from 
both the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England. US stocks extended their rally on Friday after the US non-farm 
payroll report revealed 150,000 job additions in October, half the September number. 
‘The weaker data helped to extend last week’s rally, with US stocks logging their best week in a year,’ said Victoria 
Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. 
‘Investors are hoping that the Fed is at the peak of its tightening cycle, also fuelling gains for equities last week after 
a torrid month for price action in October.’ 
Positive news came from Irish budget airline Ryanair, which jumped more than 7% after it confirmed it will pay its 
first ever dividend as profits surged to nearly €2.2bn thanks to an increase in passenger fares. Europe’s largest 
discount airline, which is listed in Dublin, plans to return a quarter of its annual profits to shareholders. 
The update from Ryanair lifted UK-listed airline stocks, with British Airways owner International Consolidated 
Airlines (IAG) up 1.1% at 152p, and mid-cap airlines Easyjet (EZJ) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) up 3.8% and 2.3%, 
respectively. 
Engineering buyout specialist Melrose (MRO) moved to the top of the index, adding 3.7%, or 18p, to reach 508p, 
after signing a new $5bn aftermarket services agreement with engines group GE Aerospace. 
Sportswear retailer JD Sports (JD) added 1.6% to reach 133p after Citi analysts initiated coverage with a ‘buy’ 
rating. 
Property stocks gave back some of the gains they made last week on expectations that the Bank of England had 
reached the peak of its interest rate hiking cycle. Unite (UTG) fell to the bottom of the blue chips, down 1.8%, at 
935p. Land Securities (LAND) fell 1% to 610p and Segro (SGRO) was down 1.25% to trade at 774p. 
FTSE steady after rate gains, Ryanair inaugural dividend lifts airlines
The FTSE 250 fell 0.38%, or 68 points, to 17,915 despite the strong showing from airlines. The mid-cap index was 
led lower by beleaguered song royalty investor Hipgnosis Songs (SONG ), which dropped 5.2%, or 3p, to 68p, as 
it halted its dividend in light of a review of its financial position. This is the latest blow for shareholders who have 
already rejected a $440m deal to sell the investment company’s 29 music catalogues, forcing the company to come 
up with a restructuring plan or wind up within six months. It regained some momentum as the morning 
continued leaving it down 3% at 70p.  
Ventilation group Volution (FAN) was down 1.6%, or 6p, at 378p, while real estate investment trust Tritax Eurobox 
(EBOX ) lost 4.1% to reach 48p, giving back a chunk of the gains the investor in European warehouses made last 
week on interest rate hopes.

November 6th, 2023 ( Digital Journal  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair on Monday announced the start of regular dividends to shareholders after net profit 
surged 72 percent in its first half on higher fares and record traffic.
Profit after tax came in at 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in the six months to the end of September year-on-year, 
Ryanair said in a statement.
The Dublin-headquartered airline said it would begin regular dividend payments for the first time in its history.
It comes as the aviation sector is enjoying a strong recovery after suffering heavy losses at the start of the decade 
when the Covid pandemic grounded flights worldwide.
"We want to thank those shareholders for their support during a very difficult Covid period," Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said.
The carrier announced "a maiden ordinary dividend of 400 million euros" spread across two equal payments in 
February and September next year.
In the years ahead, Ryanair said it expects to pay about 25 percent of net profits in dividends.
The dividend announcements, along with expectations of record-high annual profits despite a number of 
headwinds, helped send Ryanair's share price rallying six percent to 16.12 euros in Dublin.
Ryanair has previously paid out a total of 6.74 billion euros in share buybacks and ad hoc dividends in the 12 years 
to 2020, the company confirmed to AFP.
– Clouded outlook –
O'Leary added that the carrier's full-year outlook "remains highly dependent on the absence of any unforeseen 
adverse events - for example such as Ukraine or Gaza - between now and the end of March".
Ryanair rewards shareholders after profit soars
Ryanair profits ballooned in the first half "thanks to a strong Easter in the first quarter, record summer traffic and 
higher fares which offset significantly higher fuel costs", the company statement said.
Traffic grew 11 percent to 105 million passengers and average fares jumped by almost one quarter.
O'Leary said the company expects record full-year net profit of between 1.85 billion euros and 2.05 billion euros - a 
forecast that assumes "modest losses" over the winter.
He added that the outlook was clouded by uncertainty over the delivery of new Boeing planes, "a significantly 
higher full-year fuel bill, very limited fourth-quarter visibility and the risk of weaker consumer spending over coming 
months".
US planemaker Boeing last month reported another hefty loss as it trimmed its full-year forecast for deliveries of the 
737 to address a manufacturing problem on the aircraft.

 Care to share? 
Despite a number of headwinds,\xC2Ryanair[1] is expecting this financial year 2024 to end with a profit after tax of 
between €1.85 and €2.05 billion, up from €1.43 billion reported over FY23. While forward bookings look good and 
fares are up by a mid-teen percentage, the first months of 2024 offer little visibility. Going into next year, Ryanair is 
concerned the most about\xC2delayed aircraft deliveries[2] and rising fuel costs. 
Ryanair reported a €2.178 billion net profit for its first half year from March to September, up from €1.371 billion in 
the same period last year. Revenues were up to €8.575 billion from €6.616 billion. Passenger revenues grew by 37 
percent to €6.074 billion from €4.425 billion and ancillary revenues by 14 percent to €2.501 billion from €2.191 
billion. Expenses were up by 24 percent to €6.159 billion, with fuel costs up by 29 percent to €2.815 billion. Staffing 
costs were also up, reflecting the pay restoration that Ryanair promised last year, having cut back wages during the 
pandemic. The operating profit was €2.416 billion, up from last year's €1.546 billion.

This week's Update features updates on several recently featured stories, including Booking.com's ongoing 
payment and fraud challenges and new legislative efforts to limit junk fees.
OTAs Raise Issues with Airlines' Aggressive Tactics. Online travel agents, On the Beach and UK Holidaymakers, 
have raised objections with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) over the aggressive tactics of 
Ryanair (and other discount airlines) to push travelers to book direct. According to the paper presented to the CMA 
and UK government, discount airlines are harming consumer choice by blocking sales of certain products (seat-only 
offerings), charging excessive OTA fees and delaying refunds. The OTAs are asking the UK competition authority 
to mandate that airlines provide with fair access to products and services and create a code of conduct for airlines 
and their OTA partners. Really?
Citi and Navan Announce Partnership. Further to my comment in last week's Update about the explosion of interest 
in small and medium businesses (SMB), Citi and Navan announced this past week a new partnership under which 
the parties will offer a travel and expense solution for Citi's Commercial Bank cardholders. For those companies 
that provide Citi cards to their employees, the new solution will provide services that rival competitors SAP Concur 
and Egencia. With the deal, Citi will be well positioned to grow its commercial card member base by offering travel 
and expense services.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) have announced a dip in passengers in 
October as the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas prompted flight cancellations.
Ryanair carried 17.1 million passengers throughout the month, which was an increase on 2022, but down on 
September's 17.4 million.
Wizz Air's monthly passengers slipped from 5.5 million to 5.4 million between September and October meanwhile, 
with its load factor similar to Ryanair's at around 93%.
The Irish carrier had cancelled 870 flights as a result of the Israel-Hamas conflict, while Wizz Air has suspended 
operations in Israel until mid-November.
Liberum analysts suggested that the reductions could hint to the beginning of a wider slowdown in the aviation 
sector, after a rapid post-Covid recovery this year.
"Although slight, this was the first fall in load factor since the recovery from the pandemic began," analysts 
commented on Ryanair's update, with the figure having fallen from 96% to 93%.
"There is a sense that load factors have plateaued," the bank added.
Investors still seemed convinced by the figures though, with Ryanair and Wizz rising 2.4% and 6.6% respectively.

(Alliance News) - Online travel agents have won a High Court fight with Ryanair Holdings PLC after suing over 
refunds paid after flights were cancelled or changed.
A judge has awarded three companies within On the Beach Group PLC GBP2 million damages after considering 
evidence at a High Court hearing in London.
Judge Nigel Cooper outlined his conclusions in a ruling published on Tuesday.
The judge said On the Beach, Sunshine.co.uk and Classic Package Holidays had claimed GBP2 million in total.
He said that figure represented the cost of flights refunded to travellers for package holidays in "circumstances 
where Ryanair have cancelled or made what are described as major changes to flights which were part of the 
packages".
Lawyers representing the airline disputed that the On the Beach group had "any good cause of action" against 
Ryanair.
The judge made findings in favour of the On the Beach group and said its claim succeeded "in the amount" of 
GBP2,056,745.
"On the Beach group's claim in this action is for a sum of some GBP2 million which they say represents the cost of 
flights which they have refunded to travellers for package holidays in circumstances where Ryanair have cancelled 
or made what are described as major changes to flights which were part of the packages," said the judge in his 
ruling.
"Although Ryanair dispute that On the Beach group have any legal entitlement to the refunds claimed, Ryanair have 
acknowledged …that for commercial and political reasons Ryanair are willing to refund the cost of flights which 
On The Beach companies win GBP2m High Court damages fight with Ryanair
have been cancelled provided that appropriate arrangements are put in place so that they are not at risk of being 
required to refund travellers twice for the same flight."
The judge indicated that the litigation was "part of a much wider" dispute "as to the extent to which online travel 
agents may book flights operated by Ryanair".
Shaun Morton, chief executive of On the Beach, said: "We welcome the High Court's decision to uphold our 
application for Ryanair to pay back what was owed.
"Today's outcome sends an important message on how refunds should be handled and emphasises the industry's 
responsibility to holidaymakers.
"On the Beach is committed to doing the right thing for its customers."

The increased financial strength of airlines post Covid-19 pandemic and recovery in air travel means airlines are in 
a better position to cover higher fuel costs and fleet renewal spending, however this also comes at a time when 
costs associated with carbon emissions are increasing.
"Maximum financial health for the global industry is extremely important," Air Control Tower (ACT) director Neil 
Glynn said during the Aviation Carbon conference in London.
"A lot of airlines are back to where they were or near enough in terms of financial leverage. That financial health 
brings M&A and other strategic opportunities, opportunities to grow the fleet and for airlines to act strategically 
rather than operate on a short-term basis."
He says there is an "inescapable" need to invest in new aircraft to mitigate future volatilities.
"It is not the case for every airline, but a lot of airlines have record Capex bills to contend with... whether you are 
Qantas or Air France-KLM or United Airlines, there is clearly a high Capex bar to supplement a high ex-fuel cost bar 
for airlines to navigate.
"That emphasises that execution needs to be strong to generate operating cash flow to fund these Capex needs."
He points to European low-cost carrier Ryanair, which has line of sight on becoming debt free in the coming years.
"It is anomalous and may not be a sensible aspiration for many other airlines, but it highlights that airlines that have 
managed their balance sheets will have lower financing costs going forward.
"That is important because airlines that are not forced to finance expensive debt or more expensive operating 
leases may end up seeing additional daylight in terms of their cost differentials.
"Those balance sheet top-ups, driven by the strong recovery, need to be used sensibly, to ensure continued strong 
performance and operating cash flow, and also, notwithstanding supply chain bottlenecks, to decarbonise via fleet 
renewal investments as soon as possible."
ETS costs for carriers in the European Union will also separate those carriers that have demonstrated good balance 
sheet management versus those that continue to struggle.
Aviation growth needs "sense-check" in bid to decarbonise: ACT
"ETS costs could cost Ryanair 8% of its revenue by 2030," he says, assuming a (EURO)79 per tonne cost in 2024 
increasing to (EURO)100 by 2030.
"Their carbon bill would prevent other airlines around the world from returning to profitability."
He also said that the growth of the industry needs to be "sense-checked", in particular for low-cost carriers, if it 
hopes to succeed in reaching net zero by 2050, arguing that simultaneous investment in growth and 
decarbonisation may not be possible for an industry that historically has struggled financially and that is vulnerable 
to economic shocks.
"The financial performance of the industry doesn't suggest that it should be growing while it is trying to decarbonise.
"In my view, the growth mantra needs to be sense-checked. There is a far higher bar for missteps for growing 
unsustainability and there are a number of airlines around the world that historically only lease aircraft. We see what 
that does to their ownership costs compared to those that don't."
Easyjet's senior sustainability manager, Lahiru Ranasinghe, said the company has a "pretty good idea" of when its 
emissions will peak. He noted however that any growth it plans to make will be within its current operating region, 
80% of which is covered in the EU and UK ETS. "It is within a capped industrial footprint."
Ranasinghe also admitted that the company's licence to grow is dependent on its ability to decouple capacity 
growth from emissions. "All the operational efficiencies and new technology is an attempt to delink business growth 
from emissions growth."
While Easyjet is exploring every avenue available to it to decarbonise, its fleet gauge homogeneity facilitates the 
ability to move to zero emissions propulsion. "It won't happen overnight, but we have a fleet of over 300 aircraft with 
a sector length of less than 1500km. So we can conceivably start transitioning that whole operation to zero carbon 
emissions from 2035 onwards.
"That is the biggest difference between the network carriers," he continued.

EU adds step-up mechanism in SAS recapitalisation
EU adds step-up mechanism in SAS recapitalisation

The European Commission has issued a new decision declaring Denmark and Sweden's participation in the 2020 
recapitalisation of SAS as compatible state aid under EU rules.
The participation is subject to the introduction of a new step-up mechanism for the states' share investments, which 
entails unilateral commitments from SAS to issue new hybrid notes to the states without any consideration, under 
certain conditions related to the states' 2020 share investments.
The 2020 investments were initially approved by the European Commission in 2020 as compatible under the EU 
Temporary Framework for state aid measures during Covid-19.
However, in May 2023 the EU General Court held, following challenges brought by Ryanair Group, that the 
European Commission had erred in its initial approval decision by not requiring the states to include a step-up 
mechanism to increase the remuneration of the states and incentivise their exit in line with the Covid-19 Temporary 
Framework.
In 2020, the states participated in the recapitalisation of SAS through a subscription for hybrid notes and common 
shares in the Scandinavian carrier for approximately SEK9.5 billion ($909 million).
The recapitalisation by the two member states comprised approximately SEK2 billion equity participation through 
the subscription of new shares, shared between Denmark and Sweden, approximately SEK6 billion newly issued 
state hybrid notes with the features of an equity instrument non-convertible into shares, of which approximately 
SEK2.5 billion is allocated to Sweden and approximately SEK 3.5 billion is allocated to Denmark, as well as 
approximately SEK1.5 billion equity participation through the subscription and underwriting of new shares in a rights 
issue, shared between Denmark and Sweden.
SAS said the contemplated step-up mechanism does not affect the investment agreement entered as part of SAS' 
Chapter 11 process in the USA.
The carrier will convene a shareholder meeting to be held in January 2024 to approve the contemplated step-up 
instrument.

Highlight: Low-cost airline Ryanair has been ordered to pay £2m ($2.43m) to online travel agency On the Beach 
for refunds paid over cancelled flights, by the High Court of Justice in the UK.
Body
The online travel agency brought the action in October 2021 after paying customers refunds for cancelled or 
significantly affected Ryanair flights during the pandemic and had asked for a summary judgment, with the judge 
ruling that the airline had no real prospect of defending the claim that it was obliged to refund the money to On the 
Beach. On the Beach CEO Shaun Morton welcomed the decision and said it emphasised the industry's 
responsibility to holidaymakers over refunds: "On the Beach is committed to doing the right thing for its customers 
and provided full cash refunds for flights that were cancelled or subject to major changes during the pandemic, 
whether or not airlines had complied with their obligations. "We continue to call on the CMA to review the anti-
competitive behaviour by certain low-cost airlines, protecting consumer choice with fair access to flights and a code 
of conduct for airlines and travel agents. 
It has taken a protracted and expensive legal process to reach today's outcome, which could and should have been 
avoided." Despite rising between 2019 and 2020, mentions of the word "bookings" in Ryanair's company filings 
have dropped overall each year since 2021, when On the Beach first filed its lawsuit, according to GlobalData's 
company 
filings 
database.

agitated Ryanair, leading CEO Michael O'Leary to describe the company as "hypocritical" and claim that the 
company used fake credit cards, emails and phone numbers to book travel for customers on the Ryanair website. In 
a quote published before the high court ruling, O'Leary said: "If Shaun Morton and his screenscraping pirate, On the 
Beach, want to call for "fair play", then they should start first with their own website. "Ryanair does not (contrary to 
the false claims of Shaun Morton) deny consumers choice. We have offered to licence OTA's like On the Beach, 
but only if they agree not to scam customers for inflated airfares or inflated ancillary services." O'Leary further

Ryanair concerned about Max delays

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has expressed concerns about its Boeing 737 Max delivery schedule, with potentially 
one in six aircraft being affected.
"While Boeing are currently suffering delivery delays with Spirit (their fuselage supplier), we are working with them 
to minimise delays ahead of peak summer 24. At this stage, we are concerned that up to 10 of our 57 contracted 
Gamechanger deliveries pre summer 24 may be delayed until winter 2024," the carrier said during its half-year 
results.
At 30 September Ryanair operated a 563 aircraft fleet including 124 Boeing Max 8200s.
Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with more than (EURO)3.6 billion ($3.86 
billion) gross cash at period-end (30 September 2023) despite (EURO)1.6 billion capital expenditure and over 
(EURO)1 billion debt repayments (including a maturing (EURO)750 million bond and (EURO)260 million 
prepayment of its revolving credit facility in August).
Net cash totalled (EURO)840 million at 30 September, versus (EURO)560 million in March. All of the Group's 
owned Boeing 737 fleet (534 aircraft) are unencumbered, said the carrier.
First-half revenues increased 37% to (EURO)6.1 billion. Traffic grew 11% to 105.4 million passengers during the 
period while average fares rose 24% to c.(EURO)58 due to a strong Easter and record summer 23 demand. 
Ancillary revenue increased 14% to (EURO)2.5 billion (c.(EURO)23.70 per passenger).
Total revenues rose 30% to (EURO)8.6 billion for the six-month period. Total operating costs increased 24% to 
(EURO)6.2 billion, primarily due to much higher fuel costs (29% increase to (EURO)2.8 billion), higher staff costs 
(reflecting pay restoration, pre-agreed pay increases and higher crewing ratios) and higher air traffic control fees.
Outlook
Ryanair continue to target approximately 183.5 million passengers fiscal year 2024 traffic, although the final figure 
depends on Boeing meeting delivery commitments between now and year-end, said Ryanair.
As previously guided, Ryanair expects ex-fuel unit costs to increase by c.(EURO)2 this year. Forward bookings 
(both traffic and fares) are robust over the late October mid-terms and into the peak Christmas travel period. With 
Ryanair concerned about Max delays
the benefit of constrained EU capacity this winter (Eurocontrol expect EU capacity to recover to only 94% of pre-
Covid) and the impact of P&W engine repairs on competitor fleets, it expects third-quarter average fares to be 
ahead of the prior year third quarter by a mid-teens percentage.
"Despite uncertainty over Boeing deliveries, a significantly higher full year fuel bill (up c.(EURO)1.3 billion on last 
year), very limited Q4 visibility and the risk of weaker consumer spending over coming months, we now expect that 
FY24 PAT will finish in a range of between (EURO)1.85 billion to (EURO)2.05 billion, assuming modest losses over 
the H2 winter period. This guidance remains highly dependent on the absence of any unforeseen adverse events 
(for example such as Ukraine or Gaza) between now and the end of Mar. 2024," said Ryanair.

SMBC AC exploring involvement in SAF offtakes

Following the acquisition of Goshawk Aviation last year, SMBC Aviation Capital became the second largest lessor 
by aircraft numbers.
In the context of sustainability in aviation, the larger the fleet, the bigger the responsibility for being aware of the 
amount of the lessor's scope 3 emissions, SMBC Aviation Capital's SVP environment social governance, Orla 
Benson, said during the Aviation Carbon event in London this week.
"It is important that we are part of the solution," Benson told delegates.
The aircraft lessor has spearheaded various initiatives including a carbon credit portfolio investment launched last 
year, with Southwest Airlines signing up as the launch customer. This was followed by its first sustainability-linked 
loan signed in October 2023 tied to ESG metrics including carbon intensity of its owned fleet and gender diversity 
across currently under-represented levels of seniority in the business.
"We continue to speak with airlines to find out what we can do to help particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 
outbreak.
"Looking at the longer term, we are thinking how to get more involved in SAF in a meaningful way. We are fortunate 
to be owned by a large Japanese conglomerate in SMBC Bank but also Sumitomo Corporation. We work closely 
with shareholders to deliver for our airlines and Sumitomo Corporation has a large green financing area as well as 
debt financing capabilities through SMBC."
She noted that SMBC AC is also looking at ways to enter into sustainable aviation fuel offtake agreements to help 
drive production.
"What the market wants is surety of offtakes, so we're looking at how to become more involved in offtake 
agreements, but this work is in its infancy stages," she said.
With the EU gradually ramping up mandated SAF blends for refuelling under the RefuelEU scheme, could 
compliance with these regulations find their way into lease agreements?
SMBC AC exploring involvement in SAF offtakes
"Absolutely," said Barry Moss, director of Avocet. "Currently there is generally an EU ETS clause in lease 
agreements... they are obligations, and they can pass onto the aircraft owner. We see that in CORSIA and the EU 
ETS and RefuelEU, and penalties are quite substantial."
Benson pointed out the importance of educating the wider team about sustainability goals. "Getting our credit teams 
up to speed takes time... we haven't really seen any lease agreements yet that are attached to KPIs, but it would be 
such a win for the leasing industry to do that, and to have airlines that want to set science-based targets where 
possible.
"I don't know if there is much scope for attaching a lease to these, but it is a way for airlines to show they are going 
above and beyond, and lessors also have to step up."
Benson recalled the Aviation Leasing Ireland conference last year where delegates heard carriers Wizz Air and 
Ryanair calling out for sustainability-linked leases. "They have to keep calling on the leasing community to step up."

 Mohammed Shiraz Riaz, aged 42, of West Yorkshire, was jailed for 14 months for drunkenly hurling racist and 
misogynistic abuse towards women on two flights back to Britain. 
The first incident happened on July 15, 2019, when Riaz began drinking Jack Daniels with cola as he sat on board 
a Ryanair flight from Morocco to Liverpool John Lennon airport from Morocco. 
According to stewardess Jelena Zuravska, trouble began when Riaz demanded another drink. 
When she said she was busy, he went to the toilet muttering 'f***ing fat b**** stewardess'. 
Ms Zuravska said: 'I remained professional and suggested that he sat down and have something to eat and at this 
point, I made the decision not to serve him any more alcohol as I didn't want to make the situation any worse. 
'But he started verbally attacking me personally, saying 'who f***ed your mother, you fat stewardess white b****'. 
'He seemed to have a real hatred towards women. He was shouting, he was screaming. He gave me the feeling he 
was going to fight me. 
'As he became more aggressive towards me and more vocal, other passengers stepped in to try and calm the 
situation. One even wanted to punch him on my behalf.' 
Riaz even used the safety announcement she made during the descent as 'an opportunity to further humiliate' her 
as he shouted 'look at that fat f***ing b****' and blew raspberries shouting 'look she's farted'. 
The crew were eventually forced to move other passengers from seats near Riaz. Related Reads 
Police at Liverpool were faced by a 'clearly upset' Ms Zurvaska with Riaz standing behind her holding a black 
holdall. 
As other passengers applauded his removal from the plane, Riaz presented his wrists to officers and said: 
'You may as well handcuff me now. I've done f*** all wrong. That fat b**** has called you to make me look stupid. 
F***ing fat b****.' 
Riaz later bit a policeman, leaving him with teeth marks on his arm. 
In the police interview, Riaz said he had taken Tramadol and two ibuprofen tablets with alcohol and claimed the 
allegations against him had been exaggerated. 
The second incident occurred on January 2, 2021, when Riaz was returning from Istanbul to Manchester. 
During the flight, Riaz drunkenly shadow-boxed in the aisles and punched the seats. 
Plane Passenger jailed for Drunken Tirade of Misogynistic Abuse
He hurled a torrent of sexist and racist abuse towards cabin crew, fellow passengers, police and female airport 
officials. 
When he was subsequently thrown off the plane, he unleashed a tirade of abuse at a female Border Force official, 
saying: 
'You f***ing b**** I bet you didn't get your leg over last night. You need a good s**g.' 
And as he was led away to the cells, Riaz shouted: 
'F*** you slag - I'll punch your f***ing head in.' 
As he was placed into a police van, Riaz continued: 
'No wonder it's so easy for us to rape your white children - you're all a bunch of p******. 
'You f***ing s***s, fat-a*** c****. White women are easy to rape. White children are easy to rape because white men 
are p******.' 
Police bodycam footage showed Riaz squaring up to another passenger at passport control before being told to 
stop swearing as children were nearby. 
One officer told Riaz: 'You might not like us but these children do not deserve this - you stink of booze.' 
Riaz replied: 'I won't shut the f*** up. You're a fat mother f***er. Why should I f***ing shut up?' 
Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard Riaz had 30 offences for drink-related thuggery, including assault 
on police and being drunk and disorderly. 
In 2019, Riaz was convicted of criminal damage after he smashed up a camper van and two hotel rooms but he 
was freed with a community order. 
He admitted being drunk on an aircraft, assaulting an emergency worker and four charges of using threatening 
behaviour. 
Riaz was not charged with any racially aggravated offences. 
In mitigation for Riaz, Ella Embleton said: 
'He recognises there is no excuse for his behaviour and describes himself as behaving like a 'Dog'.' 
'He is very embarrassed by his actions on these two days. 
'His underlying problem is alcohol. When he has one drink he goes on to binge drink and he gets carried away. The 
behaviour he displays when he is intoxicated is not reflective of the man he is when sober.' 
Judge Joanne Woodward told Riaz: 
'This was a sustained course of highly abusive conduct causing distress to others. 
'The level of verbal abuse in the presence of families and young children was at the highest end.' 
Riaz was jailed for 14 months.

(Alliance News) - Online travel agents have won a High Court fight with Ryanair Holdings PLC after suing over 
refunds paid after flights were cancelled or changed.
A judge has awarded three companies in the On The Beach Group PLC group GBP2 million damages after 
considering evidence at a High Court hearing in London.
On The Beach shares rose 0.7% to 95.00 pence each in London on Tuesday. 
Judge Nigel Cooper outlined his conclusions in a ruling published on Tuesday. The judge said On the Beach, 
Sunshine.co.uk and Classic Package Holidays had claimed GBP2 million in total.
He said that figure represented the cost of flights refunded to travellers for package holidays in "circumstances 
where Ryanair have cancelled or made what are described as major changes to flights which were part of the 
packages".
Lawyers representing the airline disputed that the On the Beach group had "any good cause of action" against 
Ryanair.
The judge made findings in favour of the On the Beach group and said its claim succeeded "in the amount" of 
GBP2,056,745.
"On the Beach group's claim in this action is for a sum of some GBP2 million which they say represents the cost of 
flights which they have refunded to travellers for package holidays in circumstances where Ryanair have cancelled 
or made what are described as major changes to flights which were part of the packages," said the judge in his 
ruling.
"Although Ryanair dispute that On the Beach group have any legal entitlement to the refunds claimed, Ryanair have 
acknowledged …that for commercial and political reasons Ryanair are willing to refund the cost of flights which 
On The Beach wins GBP2 million High Court damages fight with Ryanair
have been cancelled provided that appropriate arrangements are put in place so that they are not at risk of being 
required to refund travellers twice for the same flight."
The judge indicated that the litigation was "part of a much wider" dispute "as to the extent to which online travel 
agents may book flights operated by Ryanair".

 A London court ordered Ryanair Holdings (RYA.IR) to pay more than 2 million pounds sterling over refunds made 
by online travel agents in response to flight cancellations made during the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to a report by Bloomberg News on Tuesday, the court has determined that the budget airline must cover 
the refunds made by package holiday firms, including On The Beach Group (OTB.L), to customers on grounds of 
"unjust enrichment."
On Oct. 27, Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary criticized On The Beach Group and its CEO Shaun 
Morton for their appeal for "fair play" and their call for the UK competition regulator to "investigate airlines."
Ryanair was 1% lower, while On The Beach Group was up 1% during late afternoon trading.

medical leave caused restrictions in the summer.
Body
London Gatwick Airport has reassured airlines that it has been working on staffing constraints at its air traffic control 
(ATC) tower to address the issues that led to temporary flight restrictions in September after a group of airline 
leaders said that the problem could not be allowed to continue. The UK's second busiest airport responded to the 
concerns collated by the Financial Times by saying it was working with UK air traffic control body NATS to fix the 
problem, while also outlining its success through the rest of the year, saying it had hit 99.6% of measured service 
level requirements during the first six months of 2023. A spokesperson said: "NATS, who operate the London 
Gatwick air traffic control tower, have been addressing the staffing constraints as a matter of urgency to ensure they 
will be able to maintain service levels next summer. "NATS continue to train additional air traffic controllers and 
expect more to qualify to work in the tower over coming months, ready for next summer. 
We continue to liaise closely with our airlines and airport partners and are keeping them closely informed." The 
original incident leading to the week of flight restrictions was attributed at the time to high levels of staff on medical 
leave, including some with reasons relating to Covid-19. While airline executives, such as British Airways' Sean 
Doyle, acknowledged that it had been a challenging time for the airport, he said that it was important the airport was 
resourced correctly, adding: "For the second biggest airport in the UK, we need to be doing better." In addition to 
Gatwick's response, NATS also clarified that it was working on fixing the staffing problems at the airport by training 
new staff, something that can take nine months even for experienced ATC controllers. A spokesperson said: "We 
have been very clear that we inherited a staff shortage when we took over the contract last autumn and are working 
to return the team to full strength. "NATS is working to a plan agreed with the Gatwick Airport team to recruit and 
train additional controllers which will deliver further resilience ahead of summer 2024." In addition to the recent 
concerns expressed by airlines, at the time of the restrictions, Ryanair had described the issue as a "shambles" and 
called on the Civil Aviation Authority to intervene. While a cause for concern on its own, the issues experienced by 
Gatwick likely received additional scrutiny as they closely followed a full nationwide outage of NATS' systems 
caused by a flight route that its flight plan processing sub-system could not process.

Airlines hit out at higher UK air traffic charges after August chaos
Airlines hit out at higher UK air traffic charges after August chaos

News that airline passengers will be hit with higher costs following the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to allowthe 
UK's air traffic controller to hike fees has been met with fury.
Given a fault in the National Air Traffic Services (NATS)system caused a week of travel chaos in August, the 
regulator's decision has faced scrutiny.
Airlines will see air traffic control fees increase from an average of £47 per flight to £64 from next year until 2027 
underthe CAA's new pricing decision.
Airlines UK boss Tim Alderslade argued that the move was "yet another kick in the teeth for passengers", following 
sweeping cancellations in August caused by a NATS issue.
Passengers will "inevitably end up footing the bill of millions of pounds for increases", he said.
Some 2,000 flights were cancelled as a result of the issue - which is said to have shut down the NATSsystem, 
leaving controllers manually inputting flight data for several hours over the August bank holiday weekend.
This saw hundreds of thousands of passengers affected, with many left waiting for hours or even days for flights to 
eventually depart.
Though NATS is under investigation over the issue, Alderslade suggested the CAA should face scrutiny too.
Airlines hit out at higher UK air traffic charges after August chaos
"It is clear that a wider independent review into how NATS is regulated is needed to protect passengers and ensure 
that airlines are not always forced to act as the insurer of last resort and bear millions of pounds of costs for failures 
that are not their fault," he added.
His comments come after heated scrutiny of NATS by airlines in the wake of the fault, with Airlines UK representing 
carriers such as easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and British Airways.
The CAA said that NATShad been granted powers to charge more in part to recover losses from the pandemic, 
alongside financing new investment.
Furthersteps following August's travel chaos will be considered following the CAA's independent review, the 
regulator added.

Ryanair gets "record" advance bookings for 17 new flights in Albania
Ryanair gets "record" advance bookings for 17 new flights in Albania

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday hailed record advance bookings on 17 new routes to and 
from Tirana, Albania, starting from Tuesday next week.
The Dublin-based budget airline said the 17 new routes will connect Albania to major inbound visitor markets, such 
as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden and the UK. 
Ryanair said it believes "substantial" traffic and tourism growth will be stimulated by its "unbeatable low air fares, 
which finally offer low fare competition and choice to the high fare airlines, who presently dominate in Albania".
Fares start from EUR15 one way, Ryanair said, forecasting 1.6 million annual passengers in the first year of the 
new flights.
"The scale of Ryanair's winter operation in Tirana with 17 routes, and over 200 weekly frequencies show the 
extraordinary demand there is for really low fare inbound travel to Albania and among Albanian citizens too," said 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. 
He added: "Ryanair is the only major airline in Europe that has recovered to 130% of its pre-Covid traffic. This 
winter we hope to receive 57 new aircraft from Boeing [Co] as part of our post-Covid growth and recovery 
plan...Ryanair plans to grow its fleet to 800 aircraft, and its traffic to 300m passengers [per annum] over the next 
decade, and we believe that Albania will be a key growth market for Ryanair's low fares."
Shares in Ryanair were down 2.1% to EUR14.06 each in Dublin midday Thursday.

Air India to shift focus to boosting ancillary revenues

Spreading wings. To provide cab, insurance services, integrate payment solutions
Air India is taking measures to boost its ancillary revenues by providing passengers cab and insurance services, 
and payment solutions, among others.
'We have partnered with Mojoboxx to provide cab services. We have added insurance services. We will also be 
integrating new payment solutions by partnering with banks and other players. We are also looking at providing tour 
packages, ' a source from the airline said.
The airline recently partnered with AccessRail to provide intermodal services to passengers. This will soon be 
integrated with its website, sources added.
The airline's website is also likely to include multiple options on seat as well as food and beverages, the person 
said.
Air India, however, did not respond to businessline's query.
Five-year goal
Air India has set a five-year goal under Vihaan.AI. The plan is to focus on five aspects: customer experience, robust 
operations, industry-best talent, industry leadership and commercial efficiency and profitability. The airline has 
completed the first phase (Taxiing Phase), as of September, and its ancillary revenues have gone up from Rs. 84 
crore to Rs. 125 crore, a 48 per cent increase. The next phases include Take Off and Climb.
Industry experts said ancillary revenues had never been the focus area. According to CAPA India, in the 10 years to 
FY2020, traffic has grown at a CAGR of 13.2 per cent, but non-passenger revenue has grown at only 4.1 per cent. 
However, at Ryanair, non-passenger revenue grew at around 1.5x traffic from FY14 to FY20, despite being in a 
mature market.
Air India to shift focus to boosting ancillary revenues
'Ancillaries have simply not been a focus. Even hand baggage fares are not being marketed with intensity,' it said.
Cargo gained attention only through compulsion, but is now recognised for the contribution it can make, CAPA India 
noted. 'A similar focus should be given to ancillaries. Airlines in India are focusing only on fares. Without a strategic 
focus on ancillaries, structural profitability is not feasible. Rather than a one-size-fits-all proposition, ancillaries can 
drive increased customisation for the passenger, while delivering higher revenue.'

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported a narrowed loss in the third quarter which it said was impacted by 
unfavourable defence performance and lower 737 deliveries. The Seattle, Washington-based aeroplane 
manufacturer reported a 13% rise in revenue to $18.10 billion from $15.96 billion the year before with a narrowed 
net loss of $1.64 billion, down from $3.31 last year. GAAP loss per share totalled $2.70, down from $5.49 a year 
ago and core LPS of $3.26 compared to $6.18. Commercial Airplanes revenue increased to $7.9 billion driven by 
higher 787 deliveries while Defence, Space & Security revenue grew 3% to $5.5 billion. 
During the quarter, Commercial Airplanes booked 398 net orders, including 150 737 MAX 10 airplanes for Ryanair, 
50 787 airplanes for United Airlines, and 39 787 airplanes for Saudi Arabian Airlines. The firm said it will deliver 
fewer 737 Max aircraft than it expected this year as it works throughproduction flawsdetected on some of the best-
selling aircraft. The company expects to hand over between 375 and 400 of the plane this year, down from a 
previous estimate of 400 to 450. Global Services revenue rose 9% to $4.8 billion with the operating margin of 
16.3% reflecting higher commercial volume and mix. 'We continue to progress in our recovery and despite near-
term challenges, we remain on track to meet the financial goals we set for this year and for the long term,' said 
Dave Calhoun, Boeing president and chief executive officer. Boeing reaffirmed guidance for the full-year of $4.5-
$6.5 billion of operating cash flow, $3.0-$5.0 billion of free cash flow and revenue of $18.1 billion. Shares in Boeing 
rose 3.7% in pre-market trading.

Many Decrees, Little Change In Italian PM Meloni's First Year

From bank profits to migrants, Giorgia Meloni's Italian government has been active on numerous fronts in its first 
year in office, but many measures seem more designed for show than lasting change.
The prime minister has sought to please her right-wing voters with a busy domestic programme, only to see 
proposals ruled unconstitutional, criticised as impossible to enforce, challenged under EU regulations, or watered 
down by parliament or her own ministers.
"The government has not done much," said Gianfranco Pasquino, professor of political science at Bologna 
University.
Instead, it has "sometimes emphasised repressive elements which please the right", without seeking to initiate 
structural reforms, he told AFP.
Claudio Cerasa, director of Il Foglio newspaper, put it more bluntly last month, accusing the government of "using 
laws not to govern but to make propaganda".
It seems to be working, however, with opinion polls showing that 12 months after taking office, Meloni's far-right 
Brothers of Italy party is more popular than ever.
Top of the list was a surprise tax on profits made by Italian banks from rising interest rates, announced late one 
August evening only to be heavily watered down after bank shares plunged the next day.
That same night, ministers announced plans to cap tickets on flights to and from the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, 
prompting low-cost carrier Ryanair to complain to the EU.
Weeks later, the government quietly dropped the plan.
Elsewhere, a law currently being debated in parliament to extend Italy's ban on surrogacy beyond its borders has 
been denounced as unconstitutional and unenforceable.
Many Decrees, Little Change In Italian PM Meloni's First Year
A totemic issue for Meloni's coalition, which places huge importance on traditional family values, the law would 
open up to prosecution Italian couples -- both straight and gay -- who use a surrogate mother even in countries 
where surrogacy is legal.
On the hot button issue of mass migration, Meloni's government has also announced a string of interventions, 
including the detention of irregular migrants and a clampdown on those posing as minors.
But two separate Sicilian judges have refused to apply one of the government's decrees on migrants.
And the number of people arriving on Italy's shores on boats from North Africa has almost doubled in the past year, 
according to interior ministry figures.
"It's one thing to make political propaganda to gain votes and win elections, it's another thing to govern," noted 
Francesco Clementi, from Rome's Sapienza University.
"The promises Meloni made as a politician, she cannot keep as prime minister."
The format is often the same. A story dominates Italy's news channels and newspapers, Meloni calls a cabinet 
meeting and they announce a new decree law to tackle the problem in question, from juvenile delinquency to the 
vandalism of public buildings.
Decree laws take effect immediately but must be approved by parliament within 60 days. Often they are amended, 
but by that time, the news cycle has moved on and what remains in the public eye is the original announcement.
Meloni is not the only prime minister to use decree laws, although analysts note she has relied on them more 
heavily than previous governments -- despite having a healthy majority in parliament, meaning she should be able 
to pass laws relatively easily.
Antonio Nicita, vice president of senators of the opposition centre-left Democratic Party, noted that Meloni herself 
used to rail against the use of decree laws while in opposition.
He accused the government of trying to distract public attention from slowing economic growth and the lack of 
progress in reducing Italy's colossal debt.
"The government is compensating for a poor socio-economic performance with ideological and populist 
interventions on crime and migrants," he told AFP.
However, Meloni has defended her record, which also includes tax cuts and support for families and businesses hit 
by high inflation.
On Sunday, marking her one-year anniversary in office, Meloni acknowledged on Facebook that the road ahead 
was "still long and winding".
"We'll continue, with our heads held high, making those courageous choices that for too long were not made."

A LONG-RUNNING feud between online travel groups and low-cost carriers is heating up after holiday retailer On 
the Beach Group called on the Competition Markets Authority (CMA) to step in to protect consumers.
In a report sent to the CMA, the aviation watchdog and senior transport ministers, On the Beach slammed 
"aggressive tactics" used by low-cost carriers to "remove consumer choice from the market".
Online travel agents (OTAs) have for years clashed with budget airlines.
On the Beach chief executive Shaun Morton said low-cost airlines are "taking advantage of their market power" 
using scaremongering and smear campaigns.
Ryanair refuted all allegations made by On the Beach and said OTAs missold flights with hidden mark-ups.
Wizz Air and Easyjet did not respond to a request for comment.

The General Court of the European Union has dismissed legal challenges brought by Ryanair against the state aid 
provided to Alitalia and Brussels Airlines during the Covid-19 pandemic. The court ruled on October 18, 2023, that 
the financial assistance received by the two carriers in 2020 was compatible with the internal market of the 
European Union.
In the case of Alitalia, the Italian carrier received two separate aid measures totaling EUR 199.45 million in 2020, 
which the European Commission approved in September of that year. The aid covered the period from March 1 to 
June 15, 2020, and a subsequent period from June 16 to October 31, 2020. Ryanair challenged these decisions, 
arguing that a formal procedure to assess compatibility had not been initiated.
The court emphasized Alitalia's significant role in global connectivity, serving over 100 destinations and employing 
more than 11,000 staff. It noted that Alitalia was involved in repatriation flights, maintained essential services, and 
operated public service obligation (PSO) routes in Italy, justifying the Italian government's decision to provide aid.
In the case of Brussels Airlines, the court rejected Ryanair's challenge to the Belgian state aid package of EUR 300 
million approved by the European Commission in August 2020. The court concurred with the commission's view 
that the aid aimed to support an essential company during the pandemic without the need for an in-depth 
investigation.
Ryanair expressed dissatisfaction with the court's rulings, stating that the decisions favored specific flag carriers 
over other EU airlines affected by the Covid-19 crisis. The airline highlighted previous rulings in May 2023, where 
the EU General Court deemed state aid received by SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, and certain Italian 
airlines as unlawful. Ryanair criticized the European Commission for not recovering the unlawful aid and not 
addressing the damage to competition caused by favoring local airlines.

The General Court of the European Union has dismissed legal challenges brought by Ryanair against the state aid 
provided to Alitalia and Brussels Airlines during the Covid-19 pandemic. The court ruled on October 18, 2023, that 
the financial assistance received by the two carriers in 2020 was compatible with the internal market of the 
European Union.
In the case of Alitalia, the Italian carrier received two separate aid measures totaling EUR 199.45 million in 2020, 
which the European Commission approved in September of that year. The aid covered the period from March 1 to 
June 15, 2020, and a subsequent period from June 16 to October 31, 2020. Ryanair challenged these decisions, 
arguing that a formal procedure to assess compatibility had not been initiated.
The court emphasized Alitalia's significant role in global connectivity, serving over 100 destinations and employing 
more than 11,000 staff. It noted that Alitalia was involved in repatriation flights, maintained essential services, and 
operated public service obligation (PSO) routes in Italy, justifying the Italian government's decision to provide aid.
In the case of Brussels Airlines, the court rejected Ryanair's challenge to the Belgian state aid package of EUR 300 
million approved by the European Commission in August 2020. The court concurred with the commission's view 
that the aid aimed to support an essential company during the pandemic without the need for an in-depth 
investigation.
Ryanair expressed dissatisfaction with the court's rulings, stating that the decisions favored specific flag carriers 
over other EU airlines affected by the Covid-19 crisis. The airline highlighted previous rulings in May 2023, where 
the EU General Court deemed state aid received by SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, and certain Italian 
airlines as unlawful. Ryanair criticized the European Commission for not recovering the unlawful aid and not 
addressing the damage to competition caused by favoring local airlines.

Wizz Air faces further challenge from Middle East conflict
Wizz Air faces further challenge from Middle East conflict

The Israel-Palestine conflict adds a new challenge for Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ), on top of its uncertainties 
from the GTF engine problems. 
Barclays highlighted data which showed 11.3% of Wizz Air's available seat kilometres were deployed on routes 
to and from Israel, Egypt and Jordan, ahead of easyJet's 10.1% and Ryanair's 3.0%. 
The bank expects trading in Wizz's other Middle East markets to face some incremental weakness as a result of the 
geopolitical instability. 
However, recalling how relatively sanguine Western European travellers were in the face of the outbreak of the 
Ukraine conflict, it thinks it is likely any softening of demand elsewhere in the Middle East would be transitory, 
provided the conflict does not spread.  
Nonetheless, the broker has lowered financial 2024 net profit estimates by 7% anticipating weakness on mid-east 
flying.  
Also weighing on the budget airline operator is the very great uncertainty about how the required checks on the 
GTF engines from Wizz's A320NEO family aircraft will get done. 
Pratt and Whitney's parent company RTX indicated aircraft would require between 250 and 300 days to be checked 
while Wizz has 104 Pratt and Whitney powered aircraft and outsources all its engine maintenance.  
It stays 'underweight," with a reduced price target of 1,500p, down from 1,800p.

Dealmaking wave raises lucrative prospect for Europe's top carriers;

Europe's three biggest long-haul airlines are pushing ahead with a series of deals that would transform the aviation 
landscape in the region by opening up lucrative routes and raising the prospect of higher profits.
If the deals materialise, it will help turn a fragmented sector with dozens of national flag carriers into a market more 
like the US, where a handful of large airlines dominate.
British Airways owner IAG, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are hoping to gain regulatory approval for deals that 
would give them a combined share of nearly three quarters of the long-haul market.
"Europe airlines need to consolidate," said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. "We will emerge with an 
industry not unlike America: US groups carrying 200mn passengers annually that have the ability to invest."
If regulators back IAG's purchase of Air Europa and Lufthansa's swoop on ITA after Air France-KLM this month took 
a 20 per cent stake in SAS, then Europe will have taken a step towards replicating the US market, the most 
profitable.
All three airline groups have expressed an interest in buying part of Portugal's national carrier TAP after Lisbon this 
month announced the start of privatisation.

At least one big airline group had considered a push into eastern Europe with a bid for a national airline there, 
according to a person familiar with the matter.
However, winning regulatory approval for cross-border mergers could be difficult in Europe, industry experts 
warned.
On Tuesday, the EU antitrust commissioner said the bloc planned to tighten rules around airline mergers because 
of competition concerns.
"There should and will be more consolidation in Europe, but it is sometimes a daunting challenge ... traditionally 
there has always been national interest and identity that has been inexorably linked to the airline industry," said Dan 
McKone, senior partner at consultancy LEK.
The European deals have come as carriers rebuild their balance sheets after a lucrative summer with 
holidaymakers shrugging off high prices and filling up planes.
That has allowed the big carriers to hunt for mergers to expand their networks with demand for travel recovering 
from the pandemic.
The dealmaking burst comes after years of steady consolidation before the pandemic had already concentrated 
long-haul flights into the hands of Europe's three large global airline groups.
IAG was formed in 2011 to consolidate regional participants into a group and owns airlines including Aer Lingus, 
Iberia and Vueling.
Lufthansa has expanded from its German roots and hoovered up other central and northern European airlines and 
also owns Swiss, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines.
Air France and KLM merged in 2004 and the group holds minority stakes in a clutch of other airlines.
Low-cost airlines have been slower to consolidate, although Wizz Air made an opportunistic bid for easyJet in 2021, 
which was rejected. O'Leary has ruled out dealmaking for Ryanair, Europe's biggest group, which will concentrate 
on organic growth through slashing fares.
Consolidation in Europe has historically lagged behind the US, which underwent frenetic consolidation between 
2008 and 2013.
In the US, the four major airlines - United, Delta, American and Southwest - will operate 72 per cent of flight 
schedules this year, according to a Financial Times analysis of figures from aviation data company OAG.
In Europe, the biggest airline groups - Ryanair, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and easyJet - have a combined 46 per 
cent market share.
US airlines are forecast to report an average pre-tax profit of $9.53 per passenger this year, more than double the 
$4.36 in Europe, according to trade body the International Air Transport Association.
Still, long-haul flying is more concentrated in Europe, and the big three groups will control 73 per cent of widebody 
capacity in the region if their proposed deals go through, according to
Robert Boyle, consultant and former director of strategy at IAG.
The effect of US consolidation had also been mixed, according to analysts.
On the one hand, it had boosted balance sheets with higher fares and fuller planes, said Savanthi Syth, an analyst 
at Raymond James. But the billions returned to shareholders instead of being invested in operations had been 
blamed for a string of disruptions.
Dealmaking wave raises lucrative prospect for Europe's top carriers Lufthansa , IAG and Air France - KLM look 
to open up routes and lift profit but face regulat....
A poll in August found that more people held a negative view of the industry than a favourable one for the first time 
in 10 years.
Yet executives in Europe are united that the push for consolidation must continue.
"We need to compete in a global market," said Luis Gallego, IAG chief executive. "The problem we have in Europe 
is we have small airlines that need to compete in a global world."
Mergers are also the route to scaling up in Europe, because opportunities for organic growth are limited, with 
ferocious competition from low-cost rivals in the short-haul market.
Added to this are capacity bottlenecks and a shortage of landing slots at the hub airports which serve long-haul 
flights, such as Heathrow.
All three airline groups circling TAP would substantially expand their presence in the lucrative South American 
market at a stroke with a deal.
Likewise, a stake in ITA, successor to the failed Alitalia, would give Lufthansa access to a base hundreds of miles 
further south from its northern European hubs, and better access to the southern hemisphere.
Gallego said that airlines would need greater scale to afford the bill for decarbonisation that is expected in the 
coming decades as the industry switches to newer, more expensive, but less polluting fuels.
Airline mergers were "nearly always compelling" on paper, said McKone, with opportunities to cut costs by 
combining maintenance operations, pooling orders for planes, and boosting revenues by optimising flight networks 
and integrating loyalty programmes.
"There is a lot of economic gravity pulling towards consolidation in the airline industry," McKone said.

US airlines are forecast to report an average pre-tax profit of $9.53 per passenger this year, more than double the 
$4.36 in Europe, according to trade body the International Air Transport Association.
Still, long-haul flying is more concentrated in Europe, and the big three groups will control 73 per cent of widebody 
capacity in the region if their proposed deals go through, according to
Robert Boyle, consultant and former director of strategy at IAG.
The effect of US consolidation had also been mixed, according to analysts.
On the one hand, it had boosted balance sheets with higher fares and fuller planes, said Savanthi Syth, an analyst 
at Raymond James. But the billions returned to shareholders instead of being invested in operations had been 
blamed for a string of disruptions.
Dealmaking wave raises lucrative prospect for Europe's top carriers Lufthansa , IAG and Air France - KLM look 
to open up routes and lift profit but face regulat....
A poll in August found that more people held a negative view of the industry than a favourable one for the first time 
in 10 years.
Yet executives in Europe are united that the push for consolidation must continue.
"We need to compete in a global market," said Luis Gallego, IAG chief executive. "The problem we have in Europe 
is we have small airlines that need to compete in a global world."
Mergers are also the route to scaling up in Europe, because opportunities for organic growth are limited, with 
ferocious competition from low-cost rivals in the short-haul market.
Added to this are capacity bottlenecks and a shortage of landing slots at the hub airports which serve long-haul 
flights, such as Heathrow.
All three airline groups circling TAP would substantially expand their presence in the lucrative South American 
market at a stroke with a deal.
Likewise, a stake in ITA, successor to the failed Alitalia, would give Lufthansa access to a base hundreds of miles 
further south from its northern European hubs, and better access to the southern hemisphere.
Gallego said that airlines would need greater scale to afford the bill for decarbonisation that is expected in the 
coming decades as the industry switches to newer, more expensive, but less polluting fuels.
Airline mergers were "nearly always compelling" on paper, said McKone, with opportunities to cut costs by 
combining maintenance operations, pooling orders for planes, and boosting revenues by optimising flight networks 
and integrating loyalty programmes.
"There is a lot of economic gravity pulling towards consolidation in the airline industry," McKone said.

Oct 20, 2023( Biofuels Digest: http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In Ireland, Ryanair purchased 500 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from OMV. This agreement will 
save over 1,250 tons in CO2 emissions (equivalent to c.100 Ryanair flights from Dublin to Vienna). 
This purchase follows on from the MoU agreement made between the companies last year, providing Ryanair with 
unique access to purchase up to 160,000 metric tons of SAF from OMV up to 2030. 
Ryanair has committed to its 12.5% SAF use by 2030 target, as well as the airline and OMV's ambition to achieve 
net-zero emissions by 2050. Ryanair has already significantly advanced these commitments by partnering with 
Trinity College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, investing $22bn in its 
'Gamechanger' fleet, which reduce CO2 emissions by 16% and a further $40bn investment for 300 Boeing 737 
MAX-10 aircraft which reduce CO2 emissions by 20% while carrying 21% more passengers.

Boeing 's 737 Max Production Issues Impacting Ryanair and the Broader Aviation Industry

Boeing's production of the 737 Max jets is currently facing another setback, much to the frustration of airlines like 
Ryanair that depend on the deliveries of these aircraft for their operations. This issue has broader implications, 
affecting the finances, reputation, and operations of the companies involved.
Boeing's 737 Max jet deliveries have been significantly delayed due to multiple production problems. The most 
recent problem stems from improperly drilled fastener holes in a component that helps maintain cabin pressure. 
This component was supplied by Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc.
Ryanair, a major European budget airline, had already sounded the alarm about potential disruptions to its flying 
schedule due to the defect from Spirit. With the issue proving harder to rectify than initially thought, Ryanair expects 
more significant delays in aircraft deliveries. The airline's CEO, O'Leary, indicates that the situation seems to be 
deteriorating, with fewer Max jets expected by the end of December than initially planned.
Boeing's recent acknowledgment about the defect's extent suggests the issue affects a significant portion of their 
737 Max inventory. This spells trouble not just for Ryanair but potentially for other airlines awaiting their Max 
deliveries.
Boeing CFO Brian West hinted that Max deliveries might hit the lower end of their estimated range. There are also 
concerns about the effect of these quality control issues on Boeing's free cash flow forecasts for the next few years. 
Earnings reports from both Boeing and Spirit in the coming weeks are eagerly anticipated and will shed more light 
on the financial repercussions of the ongoing crisis.
Boeing's troubles with the 737 Max, starting with the high-profile crashes and subsequent worldwide grounding, 
have been a significant blow to its reputation and finances. The production issues further exacerbate this situation. 
For airlines like Ryanair, which have significant operational plans tied to the delivery of these aircraft, these delays 
can mean curtailed flight schedules, potential revenue loss, and logistical challenges.
From an industry perspective, the timely delivery of aircraft is paramount for airlines. With the 737 Max being a 
popular choice for many carriers due to its fuel efficiency and passenger capacity, disruptions in its delivery can 
have a ripple effect across the aviation industry.
Boeing 's 737 Max Production Issues Impacting Ryanair and the Broader Aviation Industry
Boeing's upcoming earnings report will be closely watched to gauge the full impact of these issues on its bottom 
line. The overarching question remains: Can Boeing swiftly address these issues to regain the trust of its airline 
partners and stakeholders, or will these setbacks give competitors like Airbus an opportunity to gain more market 
share?

Boeing's production of the 737 Max jets is currently facing another setback, much to the frustration of airlines like 
Ryanair that depend on the deliveries of these aircraft for their operations. This issue has broader implications, 
affecting the finances, reputation, and operations of the companies involved.
Boeing's 737 Max jet deliveries have been significantly delayed due to multiple production problems. The most 
recent problem stems from improperly drilled fastener holes in a component that helps maintain cabin pressure. 
This component was supplied by Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc.
Ryanair, a major European budget airline, had already sounded the alarm about potential disruptions to its flying 
schedule due to the defect from Spirit. With the issue proving harder to rectify than initially thought, Ryanair expects 
more significant delays in aircraft deliveries. The airline's CEO, O'Leary, indicates that the situation seems to be 
deteriorating, with fewer Max jets expected by the end of December than initially planned.
Boeing's recent acknowledgment about the defect's extent suggests the issue affects a significant portion of their 
737 Max inventory. This spells trouble not just for Ryanair but potentially for other airlines awaiting their Max 
deliveries.
Boeing CFO Brian West hinted that Max deliveries might hit the lower end of their estimated range. There are also 
concerns about the effect of these quality control issues on Boeing's free cash flow forecasts for the next few years. 
Earnings reports from both Boeing and Spirit in the coming weeks are eagerly anticipated and will shed more light 
on the financial repercussions of the ongoing crisis.

Ryanair to purchase 500 tonnes of SAF from OMV
Ryanair to purchase 500 tonnes of SAF from OMV

Highlight: European budget airline Ryanair has purchased 500t of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from oil, gas and 
chemicals company OMV as it continues its work to reach a 12.5% SAF use target by 2030.
Body
The purchase is part of the airline's memorandum of understanding (MoU) agreement made with OMV last year for 
access to purchase up to 160,000t of SAF from OMV in Austria, Germany and Romania through 2030, as part of its 
ambitions to reach net zero by 2050, in line with the industry standard. Ryanair's head of sustainability Steven 
Fitzgerald said: "SAF plays a key role in our Pathway to Net Zero decarbonisation strategy, in which we have 
committed to increasing our use of SAF over the coming years-a commitment that this deal with OMV will help 
move further forward." The deal builds on another MoU signed between Ryanair and Spanish energy company 
Repsol earlier this year, which also outlined potential access to up to 155,000t of SAF between 2025 and 2030 for 
the airlines' Spain and Portugal operations.  The fuel, which can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to 
conventional fuel, has gained popularity within the aviation industry as a key part of achieving its net zero goals, 
with most of the major airlines investing in the technology, including Emirates, United and Virgin Atlantic. 
Martijn van Koten, OMV's executive vice-president of fuels and feedstock, said: "We are building a growth business 
for sustainable aviation fuel to support the industry's journey towards a more sustainable future. "We are proud of 
our partnership with Ryanair that allows both companies to leverage their expertise in promoting the use of SAF. 
This facilitates the transition towards the application of more sustainable forms of energy and helps reduce the 
climate impact of aviation." OMV has also previously agreed to supply SAF to other European airlines, including 
Austrian Airlines, which also partnered with the company to produce the fuel at a factory in Austria.

O'Leary: NATS air traffic report a 'tissue of lies'
O'Leary: NATS air traffic report a 'tissue of lies'

RYANAIR's chief executive Michael O'Leary launched a tirade against the boss of Britain's National Air Traffic 
Services (NATS,) describing the group's report into August's air traffic control disaster as a "tissue of nonsense".
Around 2,000 flights were cancelled on 28 August across the UK, following a system-wide failure at the premier 
airspace provider.
In a heated Transport Select Committee hearing yesterday, airline bosses revealed the extent of this failure, in 
direct contradiction to NATS's own account of the event. O'Leary claimed NATS was ill-prepared and staff were 
working from home.
However, NATS remains firmly behind its preliminary report. Its chief Martin Rolfe said the failure was "unlike any 
we'd seen before".

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC fell on Wednesday after rival Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) 
was dealt a downgrade by Citigroup.
Kicking Wizz from its 'neutral' to 'sell' lists, Citi pointed to future reductions in the airline's capacity from 
investigations into potential issues with Pratt & Whitney engines.
Wider concerns with the short-haul sector were also cited despite Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz enjoying a more rapid 
post-pandemic recovery than those primarily committed to longer routes.
"We believe pricing will lose momentum in short-haul compared to long haul," the bank said in a note.
Ryanair was indeed specifically tipped by Citi as likely to outperform against peers on pricing, given the Irish carrier 
has more flexibility, according to the bank.
However, the view that things may not be as rosy in the short-haul sector was echoed by Deutsche Bank analysts.
Pointing to the "uneasy" market, which resulted in easyJet shares falling despite a confident update last week, 
Deutsche hit the carrier with lower profit expectations.
Higher than anticipated fuel costs may not be offset by higher yields per seat, the German bank said, leading to 
lower-than-expected growth in pre-tax profits for easyJet over the coming years.
Shares in Wizz fell almost 5% to 1,615p on Wednesday.
Ryanair , easyJet fall on analysts' short-haul aviation concerns
Ryanair and easyJet were down 2.7% and 4% respectively, with Tui AG and Jet2 PLC (AIM:JET2) also taking a hit.

Shares in Wizz Air Holdings are flying low, down 3.2% at 1,642p after Citi put the stock on its 'sell' list, downgrading 
from 'neutral'.
"We believe pricing will lose momentum in short haul compared to long haul," the broker said.
In the short haul sector, it expects Ryanair will outperform on pricing against peers, driven by network flexibility.
But it thinks the recent engine-related bottlenecks will impact around 4% of short haul capacity, with Wizz the most 
exposed, with around 23% exposure of current capacity.
"We downgrade Wizz to sell, given the impact on capacity ramp-up will result in unit cost pressure," Citi said. 
The broker also more than halved its price target to 1,400p from 3,100p.
Citi has also lowered the price target for IAG, the owner of British Airways, to 175p from 195p although it has kept a 
'buy' rating.
Lufthansa has been downgraded to neutral, due to downside risk to its 2024 margin target.
Lufthansa shares are down 2.4% to (EURO)6.95 in Frankfurt today.

(ANSA) - OCT 18 - The subsidies granted by Italy to now-defunct flag carrier Alitalia during the COVID-19 
pandemic constitute aid compatible with the internal market, the General Court of the EU ruled Wednesday, 
rejecting Ryanair's two appeals challenging the European Commission's green light for state aid. According to the 
Court, Alitalia played an important role in the air service and the country's economy, serving more than 100 
destinations around the world and carrying more than 21 million passengers. As a result, the judges note, the 
reasons why Italy chose this company as the sole beneficiary of the measure are clear. Alitalia was wound up last 
year and replaced by a smaller airline, ITA Airways.

(ANSA) - OCT 18 - The subsidies granted by Italy to now-defunct flag carrier Alitalia during the COVID-19 
pandemic constitute aid compatible with the internal market, the General Court of the EU ruled Wednesday, 
rejecting Ryanair's two appeals challenging the European Commission's green light for state aid. According to the 
Court, Alitalia played an important role in the air service and the country's economy, serving more than 100 
destinations around the world and carrying more than 21 million passengers. As a result, the judges note, the 
reasons why Italy chose this company as the sole beneficiary of the measure are clear. Alitalia was wound up last 
year and replaced by a smaller airline, ITA Airways.

Ocado Group PLC (LSE:OCDO) , the grocery technology company, saw its client ICA, the Swedish retailer, shut 
down one of its e-commerce warehouses,  a move which analysts at Barclays feel could dampen sentiment 
surrounding the stock.
ICA, the leading grocer in Sweden, is closing a warehouse in Gothenburg as part of an alteration to its e-commerce 
strategy and while this won't cause any closures of Ocado's customer fulfilment centres (CFC) it will result in the 
cessation of its in-store fulfilment (ISF) software at one site.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC fell on Wednesday after rival Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ)  
was dealt a downgrade  by Citigroup.
Kicking Wizz from its 'neutral' to 'sell' lists, Citi pointed to future reductions in the airline's capacity from 
investigations into potential issues with Pratt & Whitney engines .
Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) 's plans to become a major player in wealth management look possibly too ambitious, 
according to analysts at Barclays.
In a presentation yesterday , Amanda Blanc, Aviva's chief executive, set out a strategy to reach at least 250 billion 
in wealth assets and at least 280 million in operating profit per annum within the next five years.
Oil and gold prices rose amid geopolitical tensions as Israel-Hamas fighting continued, with investment bank 
strategists saying the energy sector is likely to see extended support from Middle East tensions.
A deadly explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, where 800 people were reported to have been killed, has 
inflamed the situation in the Middle-East just as US President Joe Biden visits the region as part of a plan to try 
and de-escalate tension.
Whitbread PLC (LSE:WTB)  impressed at its interims and the results have gone down well in the City with shares 
top of the FTSE 100 risers, up 2.5%.
Aviva , Ocado , Ryanair and more: What brokers said today
Jefferies said the results were 'strong' with sales a 1.4% beat and adjusted pre-tax profit a 14.5% beat against 
consensus.
As  ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)  shares fell in Amsterdam and New York pre-market trading on a 
downgrade of 2024 guidance, Bank of America was looking another year ahead and added the stock as its 'top 
pick' in the European semiconductor sector. 
Other investment banks also saw the reset guidance, where ASML  warned that revenues are likely to be flat in 
2024  versus its prior guide of 'growth', as a positive turning point.  
UK water companies will need to invest 272 billion - three times the sector's current 94 billion existing capital value - 
to meet commitments on leak reductions and sewage treatment, according to Moody's.
On the basis of the industry's own forecasts, the credit agency said significant new debt and equity funding will be 
needed if the sector's plans are to be delivered.
Hostelworld (LSE:HSW)  has upgraded its 2023 earnings guidance after generating record annual turnover due to a 
surge in global bookings, it said in a trading update today.    
Now could be a good time to buy shares in the company, according to analysts, who believe there could be 
further headroom in  Hostelworld (LSE:HSW) 's share price, which lifted to 120p per share after a slight uptick this 
morning. 
Shares in Wizz Air Holdings are flying low, down 3.2% at 1,642p after Citi put the stock on its 'sell' list, downgrading 
from 'neutral'.
"We believe pricing will lose momentum in short haul compared to long haul," the broker said.

Hungary's supreme court, the Curia, has affirmed the Budapest municipal government's decision to impose a 
HUF200 million forint (USD545,000) fine on Ryanair (FR, Dublin International). The ruling, stemming from an 
"official consumer protection procedure" initiated in April 2020, alleges that the low-cost carrier violated consumer 
protection laws by not adequately informing passengers about a flight delay from Budapest to Gran Canaria on 
February 18 of the same year.
The Budapest municipal government office, acting as a consumer protection authority, maintains that Ryanair's 
failure to provide timely information amounted to "an unfair commercial practice." Ryanair has not yet responded to 
the recent ruling.
This decision is separate from another consumer protection fine imposed on Ryanair in Hungary, totaling HUF300 
million (USD818,000), related to a departure tax implemented by the national government in the previous year. In 
June 2023, the Metropolitan Court of Budapest annulled this fine, stating that the airline lawfully passed the tax on 
to consumers in accordance with European Union regulations, a verdict welcomed by Ryanair.
It remains to be seen how Ryanair will address the upheld HUF200 million fine from the supreme court.

Airline bosses dismiss Dutch plan to phase out EU fossil fuel subsidies as 'pie in the sky' Transport
Airline bosses dismiss Dutch plan to phase out EU fossil fuel subsidies as

Airline bosses have criticised a Dutch plan for an EU-wide phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, saying such a move 
will be fanciful until there are affordable greener travel alternatives. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and Lufthansa 
chief executive Carsten Spohr were among European airline executives who said at a briefing last week that train 
fares remained too expensive to replace air travel, and policymakers' plans to make aviation more sustainable by 
cutting support would backfire.
The Dutch government announced last month it spent up to (EURO)46.4bn in 2023 supporting the use of fossil 
fuels, either through direct subsidies or tax schemes that indirectly led to more polluting energies being used. More 
than (EURO)3.6bn went to airlines, as fuel supplied for use in aviation is currently fully exempt from taxation in the 
EU.
Rob Jetten, the Dutch climate minister, said that reforming the tax system and cutting subsidies was "crucial" to 
delivering the clean transition, and that governments should "redesign the rules of the market".
He added, however, that fossil fuel subsidies, particularly ones that resulted from international agreements such as 
for airlines and shipping, "need to be tackled from the EU level".
But O'Leary pointed out: "Until you have some affordable alternative that you can offer to voters and to consumers 
across Europe, it's all just pie in the sky."
Airline bosses dismiss Dutch plan to phase out EU fossil fuel subsidies as 'pie in the sky' Transport
Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of industry body Airlines for Europe, added that increasing fuel taxes for 
airlines would increase costs, which "at some point will impact the passenger".
Fuel is one of the single biggest expenses for airlines, and accounts for about 25 per cent of operating costs. 
Aviation is also among the toughest sectors to decarbonise, with alternatives to jet fuels still at an embryonic stage.
The airline industry last week reiterated calls for more support to increase production and lower the cost of socalled 
sustainable fuels, which are significantly less polluting than kerosene.
European airlines have historically struggled with profitability amid thin margins, leaving them limited capital to 
invest on decarbonisation, Spohr said.
Still, the industry is enjoying a strong run amid high ticket prices, and European airlines are forecast by trade body 
Iata to post a combined $5.1bn net profit this year, having lost more than $45bn during the pandemic.
Wopke Hoekstra, the EU's new climate commissioner, has also backed plans to phase out fossil fuel support 
schemes, although there is "no guarantee on the outcome", one EU official insisted.
O'Leary dismissed the Dutch push to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, which for airlines include exemptions on 
kerosene tax and VAT for passenger transport, as a "wish list".
An EU proposal to update energy rules in 2019, which aimed to remove many fossil fuel subsidies, has stalled as it 
requires unanimous approval from all 27 member states, which it is unlikely to secure.
EU ministers were due to discuss support for fossil fuels yesterday as part of negotiations ahead of the UN COP28 
climate summit in December.
The Dutch government has been among the toughest in Europe on airlines as it tries to cut carbon emissions to 
meet its target of achieving net zero by 2050.
In January, The Hague increased air passenger duty and in February it introduced a cap on the number of flights 
permitted at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, which is the Netherlands' largest.
Other European countries, including Ireland, Austria and Denmark, have all indicated support for the subsidy 
phaseout plan, according to an official close to the talks.
Jetten acknowledged that some sectors would have "to pay extra in energy taxes in the upcoming years, and it 
makes total sense because they've been using [fossil fuels] for extremely low prices for a very long time and we 
need to change that".

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - October 17, 2023 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Copa Holdings CPA[1], Azul S.A. AZUL[2], 
Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[3] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4]. Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst 
Blog:Airlines Post Impressive September Traffic Numbers: An Analysis The Zacks Airline[5] industry has been 
benefiting from buoyant air-travel demand, following the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions and the reopening of 
the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand for domestic as well as international 
flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk 
of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings, Azul S.A., Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes 
and Ryanair Holdings reported impressive traffic numbers for September. Each of these companies presently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here[6]. Let's Take an In-depth Look at These Companies' September Traffic Reports Driven by high passenger 
volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits in September on a 
year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In September, available seat 
miles (a measure of capacity) increased 13.6% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 14.1%. With

 The Zacks Airline[1] industry has been benefiting from buoyant air-travel demand, following the easing of COVID-
19 travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in 
demand for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher 
passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[2], Azul S.A. AZUL[3], Gol Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes GOL[4] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported impressive traffic numbers for September. 
Each of these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks 
#1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Let's Take an In-depth Look at These Companies' September Traffic Reports 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in September on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In 
September, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 13.6% year over year. Revenue passenger 
miles increased 14.1%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 87.3% from 86.9% in September 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul reported double-digit year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for September 2023. 
In September, AZUL's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat 
kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 18.7% and 15%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With 
consolidated passenger traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 81.7% from 79.1% in September 2022. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (10.6%) outpacing available seat kilometers (7.4%), the 
load factor increased to 79.4% from 77.1% in September 2022. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 51.1% and 49.7%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor increased to 89.1% from 88.3% in September 2022.

registered an 11.2% year-over-year increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 14.1% year over year.

Ryanair, a European carrier, also reported impressive traffic numbers for September 2023, driven by upbeat air-
travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 17.4 million, implying that 
9% more passengers flew than a year ago. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 
94% in September 2023. The reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 97,350 flights 
in September 2023. Year-to-date Price Performance In fact, air traffic has been buoyant throughout the year,

Highlight: Retail Banker International asks the experts on how the markets are reacting to the Israel conflict with 
Hamas. As the death toll rises and more nations are impacted, the investors need to be aware
Body
Nikos Tzabouras, Senior Financial Editorial Writer at FXCMMarket reaction to the Hamas-Israel conflict was 
immediate.US Oilrose on Monday, as the events can affect the supply and demand of oil and Iran's return 
prospects, although it is early to assess the full impact. The events unfold at a time when supply is tight and 
inventories dwindle, due to the massive OPEC+ cuts. On the other hand, there are fears around demand as China's 
recovery is failing, while the US Fed ispushing the higher-for-longer narrative. Energy giants like BP and Shell 
strengthened. Major airliners such as Lufthansa, Ryanair and Delta Airlines faced pressure on Monday, as they 
already deal with increasing fuel costs.XAU/USDmanaged to avoid fresh 2023 lows, the risk aversion may give it 
the chance to reclaim the EMA200 (at around 1,891). Daily closes above would pause the downside bias, but we 
are cautious around its ascending prospects and the upside looks unhospitable, with multiple roadblocks.Despite 
this week's surge,XAU/USDcomes from a losing month due to the Fed's hawkish bias which benefits the 
greenback, and Friday's strong NFPs support the higher-for-longer narrative. 
The commodity is at risk of new 2023 lows (1,804), although further losses towards and beyond 1,765 may prove 
elusive in the near term. The daily chart is also unfavourable since a Death Cross has formed (EMA50 Russell 
Shor, Senior Market Specialist at FXCMThe Hamas attacks and incursion into southern Israel on Saturday morning 
is the deadliest in 50 years and carries the highest civilian casualty count. As such, financial markets begin the 
week on tentative footing.Given the conflict in the Middle East, the dollar considered the current haven of choice 
and is showing bullish signs. Its green 5-hour EMA has crossed above its orange 10-hour EMA and the stochastic 
has also crossed positively (black ellipses). The stochastic has pushed into the 80+ levels (blue arrow). If it 
maintains at these levels, there will be an underlying bullish momentum which will support the dollar price. Norman 
Villamin, group chief strategist, UBPThe Hamas invasion of southern Israel over the weekend is an eruption of an 
ongoing regional conflict and humanitarian crisis which has the potential to expand into a prolonged conflict that 
historically has been a headwind for global equity markets. A look back at the impact of such geopolitical conflicts 
on the S&P 500 going back to 1940 - ranging from coups/assassinations, to terrorist events, and including cross-
Israel -Hamas conflict: markets reaction latest
border wars between nation-states - in aggregate suggests modest upfront impact of such events which dissipate 
quickly. However, the type and duration of the event are significant in understanding the potential impact upon 
markets. Indeed, domestic terrorist attacks (2004 Madrid, 2005 London, etc.) have historically had only temporary 
impacts on markets, with the S&P 500 rising, on average 3-12 months afterwards. Importantly, however, prolonged 
conflict between or eventually drawing in multiple nations has presented at least a 6-month headwind to US equity 
returns with the notable exception being the start of hostilities in Korea. ImplicationsThus, the risk that the largest 
incursion into Israel since 1973 transforms from a localised event to one that is prolonged and engulfs a wider 
range of nations should be among the key concerns for investors. Indeed, a prolonged conflict has the potential to 
draw in Iran and imperil the potential normalisation of Saudi-Israeli ties that are reported to be close to being 
announced. With Iranian exports and US releases from its strategic petroleum reserve having virtually fully offset 
Saudi supply cuts since September, a global response which reduces Iranian supply where Saudi Arabia does not 
compensate with increased production would create a renewed supply shock for global energy markets. With 
energy equities historically cheap on an absolute basis and relative to the broader market, the sector may offer a 
safe haven amidst the geopolitical uncertainty introduced over the weekend. Nigel Green, CEO, deVere GroupThe 
events in this region are now directly impacting financial markets worldwide, which, as ever in times of increased 
volatility, is immediately prompting some investors into selling off riskier parts of their portfolios, such as stocks and 
some currencies. Oil has a disproportionate impact on global financial markets due to its pivotal role in the world 
economy, its interconnectedness with various sectors, and its potential to influence broader economic conditions 
and investor sentiment. I would urge investors to avoid knee-jerk reactions to the oil price surge and geopolitical 
tensions that are creating the market turbulence. Investors are likely to profit by sitting still and not selling and then 
having to buy back at higher prices. Indeed, savvy investors, including the likes of Warren Buffett, will likely use the 
volatility and lower entry points to top-up their portfolios for the long-term with high quality stocks that have robust 
fundamentals. Diversification is your best weapon to mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical events. While 
short-term market fluctuations can be unsettling, it's essential to maintain a long-term perspective when making 
investment decisions. Historically, markets have rebounded from geopolitical crises, and a well-constructed portfolio 
can weather such storms. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves LansdownThe shocking 
attacks inIsraelhave sent the price of oil soaring, as investors assess the potential for the conflict to disrupt supply in 
the Middle East, if other countries are drawn in. With theIsraeli government warning of a long and difficult war, there 
are concerns that deep and incessant retaliative strikes on Gaza could potentially bring Iran into the conflict and 
have an impact on the flow of energy in the region. The strikes and incursions by Hamas have sent the price of a 
barrel of the benchmark Brent crude, up by more than 3%, to trade above $87 a barrel. It's the latest surprise twist 
in the path of oil prices, with the commodity pushed upwards partly due to supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, 
then buffeted down by concerns about a weakening global growth outlook. This latest jump will fuel inflationary 
worries, at a time when investors are already jittery about the interest rates potentially staying higher for longer. 
Nerves are showing signs of being frayed again just as investors had started to breathe a sigh of relief that the US 
might be heading for a softer landing, despite the high level of interest rates.Investors had cheered Friday's jobs 
data given that it showed continued strength of the US economy, with a bumper payroll number, but also indicated 
that wage growth was moderating. With geo-political risk sharply in focus we've seen investors retreat into safe 
haven assets, with the dollar and the yen edging up, while gold has jumped 1%. The ultra-cautious mood is set to 
keep a lid on gains for the FTSE 100. While the higher oil price is set to support energy stocks, nervousness about 
a conflict escalating in the US is set to keep the index trading pretty flat in early trade. The S&P 500 is expected to 
start the week in a downbeat mood, given the shocking eruption of conflict inIsrael. The latest inflation snapshot, 
due out this week, is set to keep investors on edge. Although price rises are expected to have slowed again in 
September, any hint of stubbornness creeping back into the picture could lead to another bout of selling. Bond 
markets are closed for Columbus Day, so it's unclear yet what impact events inIsraelwill have on Treasury yields, 
although concerns about fresh inflationary pressures from higher oil prices, may limit a move lower despite a search 
for safety by other investors.

London's Luton Airport reopens after major disruption caused by a parking garage fire
London's Luton Airport reopens after major disruption caused by a parking

LONDON (AP) — London's Luton Airport reopened Wednesday after a vehicle fire spread through a newly built 
parking garage, causing the partial collapse of the structure and major disruption for tens of thousands of 
passengers.
Dozens of flights were canceled, diverted or delayed at Luton, located about 56 kilometers (35 miles) north of 
central London, after the blaze erupted late Tuesday.
Four firefighters and an airport employee were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation after the fire.
Officials at the airport, which is a hub for easyJet, Ryanair and other budget airlines running flights to destinations in 
the United Kingdom and Europe, said flights began to arrive and take off again Wednesday afternoon.
Investigators believe the fire started with a diesel vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson of the 
Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. The recently opened parking garage didn't appear to have sprinklers, he 
said.
“And then that fire has quickly and rapidly spread," Hopkinson told reporters. More than 100 firefighters were 
deployed to tackle the blaze, he said.
Authorities said they don’t believe someone started the fire intentionally.
Some passengers had to sleep on the floor in the airport or wait at the nearby railway station after their flights were 
canceled or delayed.
Nikodem Lesiak, a university student trying to return to Poland, said he spent the night at the station.
“When we got here, we found out Luton is burning and everything is closed, and we were supposed to have our 
flight at 7:50 today but it was canceled," he said.
London's Luton Airport reopens after major disruption caused by a parking garage fire
Video posted on social media and on the websites of British news outlets Tuesday showed police and fire 
department vehicles gathered outside the multistory parking structure where the top level was engulfed in flames.
Russell Taylor, 41, an account director from Kinross, Scotland, saw the flames after flying in to Luton from 
Edinburgh. He said that he first saw a couple of fire engines with a car on fire on an upper level of the garage, 
which served Terminal 2.
"A few minutes later, most of the upper floor was alight, car alarms were going off with loud explosions from cars 
going up in flames," he said. "The speed in which the fire took hold was incredible.”

LONDON (AP) — A massive fire tore through a newly built parking garage at one of London's international airports 
early Wednesday, and four firefighters and an airport employee were hospitalized for smoke inhalation.
All flights at Luton Airport were suspended until 3 p.m. U.K. time Wednesday, the airport said in a statement, and 
would-be passengers were asked to stay away because emergency crews were still on scene and access was 
restricted.
Luton, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of central London, is a hub for budget airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair 
and others.
In addition to the five people hospitalized, a sixth person was treated at the scene.
Video posted on social media and on British news outlets’ websites showed police and fire department vehicles 
gathered outside a multi-story parking structure where the top level was engulfed in flames.
The parking garage for Terminal 2 partially collapsed after the fire started around 9 p.m. Tuesday.
Russell Taylor, 41, an account director from Kinross in Scotland, saw the flames after flying in to Luton from 
Edinburgh. He told the PA news agency that he first saw a couple of fire engines with a car on fire on an upper 
level.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) have been forced to suspend flights in and out of 
Luton Airport after a fire partially destroyed a car park at the site overnight.
At least 140 flights are said to have been cancelled while the airport suspends operations until three o'clock on 
Wednesday afternoon, with some 25,000 passengers set to be affected.
In a lunchtime update today, Luton Airport said it is preparing to resume its first flights at about 3pm. 
As well as easyJet and Ryanair, other airlines operating out of Luton include Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) 
and TUI (LSE:TUI).
EasyJet said in a statement that it would offer refunds or rebooking for those affected, while Ryanair said 
passengers would be contacted via email or SMS "as soon as possible".
"The safety and well-being of customers and crew is easyJet's highest priority and although this situation is outside 
of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused," the former said.
Wizz echoed the statement, adding its flights would have to be cancelled also.
More than 100 firefighters attended the scene as the airport's second terminal car park went up in flames on 
Tuesday evening, believed to have started in a diesel vehicle. 
Around 1,500 vehicles were said to be in the car park at the time, many of which were not damaged, according to 
reports.

International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG) budget airline Vueling has been hit by a competition probe in Italy 
over 'profiling' customers and charging different fees for carry-on luggage depending on how they book.
Italy's competition authority, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato or AGCM, claims that the Spanish 
airline has not been upfront about differing hand luggage costs depending on whether the customer uses the 
company's website or mobile app to purchase tickets.
"It would seem that the device used by the consumer is also used as a parameter to proceed with customer 
profiling in such a way as to differentiate the purchase price of the ticket," the AGCM said in a statement.
If such practices are proven the watchdog said it could represent "non-transparent and omissive information" on 
how Vueling sets prices.
Vueling's response statement asserted that its luggage pricing model is "transparent and complies with the 
regulations".
The airline denied any discrepancies in fees based on the device used or whether the customer accessed its 
website or app. Vueling also committed to closely collaborating with the Italian officials to furnish any required 
information and resolve uncertainties.
IAG also owns airline brands like British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.
IAG's Spanish budget airline faces another hand luggage probe
This investigation follows an earlier probe in Spain where the Ministry of Consumer Affairs opened proceedings 
against several 'low-cost' airlines for charging hand luggage transported, following complaints filed against Ryanair, 
Vueling, easyJet, Volotea and Eurowings. The Spanish regulator said Eurowings would not be among those being 
prosecuted.

Ryanair : Passengers to feel the cost of carbon clampdown
Ryanair: Passengers to feel the cost of carbon clampdown

PASSENGERS risk bearing the brunt of higher prices amid the government's "unfair" clampdown on carbon 
emissions, Ryanair, one of the UK's leading airline operators, has warned.
The typically combative budget airline giant told City A.M. that newly introduced costs for carriers represent "an 
unfair burden for UK consumers who have no alternative means of connectivity".
"While Ryanair supports the goal of net zero emissions, achieving this poses unique challenges for the UK whose 
citizens and economy are dependent on air connectivity with the EU," a spokesperson said.
Ryanair's stinging criticism follows the government's decision to cut carbon allowances on Thursday, which has 
piled further pressure on aviation to go green.
Carbon allowances are effectively permission slips from the government for emissions, with energy intensive 
sectors such as aviation, manufacturing and power required to pay for every unit of carbon they emit.
Last week, the government unveiled a 12.4 per cent cut in available allowances next year: dropping from 79m to 
69m - their lowest-ever level.
It is now targeting a 45 per cent reduction by 2027 as part of its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and an over 80 
per cent decline by the end of the decade.
Ryanair argued that short-haul passengers were paying an "unfair burden" for decarbonising aviation, as long-haul 
airlines are currently exempt from the scheme.
Ryanair : Passengers to feel the cost of carbon clampdown
Airlines UK, the trade body representing the country's carriers, estimated that carriers would be forced to cough up 
an additional £4bn into the UK Emissions Trading Scheme by the end of the decade.
"It is vital for the UK's competitiveness as a global aviation hub that this additional burden is balanced by steps that 
drive net zero solutions," it said, giving the example of incentivising home production of sustainable aviation fuels, 
as is done in rival markets such as the EU and US.
The government hopes to soften the challenge industries face by allowing unused allowances between 2021 and 
2023 to be used in auctions between 2024 and 2027.
City A.M. approached the government for comment.

LONDON — London's Luton Airport reopened Wednesday after a vehicle fire spread through a newly built parking 
garage, causing the partial collapse of the structure and major disruption for tens of thousands of passengers.
Dozens of flights were canceled, diverted or delayed at Luton, located about 56 kilometers (35 miles) north of 
central London, after the blaze erupted late Tuesday.
Four firefighters and an airport employee were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation after the fire.
Officials at the airport, which is a hub for easyJet, Ryanair and other budget  airlines  running flights to destinations 
in the  United Kingdom  and Europe, said flights began to arrive and take off again Wednesday afternoon.
Investigators believe the fire started with a diesel vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson of the 
Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. The recently opened parking garage didn't appear to have sprinklers, he 
said.
'And then that fire has quickly and rapidly spread,' Hopkinson told reporters. More than 100 firefighters were 
deployed to tackle the blaze, he said.
Authorities said they don't believe someone started the fire intentionally. more

How to Find Strong Transportation Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises

Surprises

Oct 11, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the 
latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter. 
Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while 
falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by 
finding positive earnings surprises. 
Now that we know how important earnings and earnings surprises are, it's time to show investors how to take 
advantage of these events to boost their returns by utilizing the Zacks Earnings ESP filter. 
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained 
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings 
revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release 
date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to 
have more information. 
The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the 
resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The Zacks Rank is also 
factored into the ESP metric to better help find companies that appear poised to top their next bottom-line 
consensus estimate, which will hopefully help lift the stock price. 
When we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-
line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, 
according to our 10 year backtest. 
Stocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line 
with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of 
stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank. 
Should You Consider Ryanair? 
How to Find Strong Transportation Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the 
bill. Ryanair (RYAAY) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.23 a share, just 26 days 
from its upcoming earnings release on November 6, 2023. 
By taking the percentage difference between the $7.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.13 Zacks Consensus 
Estimate, Ryanair has an Earnings ESP of +1.29%. Investors should also know that RYAAY is one of a large group 
of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter[1] to uncover the best stocks to buy or 
sell before they've reported. 
RYAAY is one of just a large database of Transportation stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is 
Alaska Air Group (ALK). 
Slated to report earnings on October 19, 2023, Alaska Air Group holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and 
it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.90 a share eight days from its next quarterly update. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alaska Air Group is $1.88, and when you take the percentage difference 
between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +0.66%. 
RYAAY and ALK's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations 
in their next earnings report.

surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here  > >[1]

LOBAL airline capacity (number of seats offered multiplied by distance flown) is finally on track to restore its pre-
pandemic levels, according to data from Circium, reported by Bloomberg. This comes after a strong period for travel 
over the busy summer months.
Easyjet, for example, reported a record pretax profit in the third quarter, Tui said it has enjoyed 'a very good travel 
summer,' and Ryanair reported its fourth straight months of record passenger numbers in August. This is thanks to 
a boost to international travel over the school holidays, an ongoing rebound in demand for travel post-pandemic, 
and higher ticket prices helping to offset inflationary pressures.
However, this hasn't necessarily translated into strong earnings. The International Air Transport Association 
estimates that profits in the industry will be down 40 per cent this year versus 2019. And for investors, shares have 
still had a difficult time, struggling to restore pre- Covid levels. Part of this is because the travel industry is closely 
correlated with the economic cycle. Elevated inflation, higher for longer interest rates, and a softening consumer 
have all sparked nervousness about the strength of ticket demand ahead. There are worries that the busy summer 
could quickly switch to a quiet winter during the colder months and in term time.
Plus, corporate travel remains weak, with online video conferencing the new norm post-Covid, particularly now that 
businesses are looking for ways to cut costs.

The rising oil price is another potential headwind for airlines, potentially adding to their costs with another sharp 
increase in the price of Brent and WTI this week. The sector got off to a bruising start to trade yesterday following 
the escalating conflict between Hamas and Israel. Flight cancellations sent shares in stocks like British Airways' 
parent company IAG, Easyjet and Air France KLM sharply into the red.

Airlines Face Increasing Greenwashing Challenges

October 10th, 2023 ( JD Supra  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On September 27, 2023, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines filed a request with the Amsterdam District Court, asking it to 
dismiss a greenwashing suit brought by environmental activist groups. According to a  statement by ClientEarth , 
which represents the groups, in 2019 KLM dropped its 'Fly Responsibly' advertising campaign after the groups filed 
a petition but the carrier did not address carbon offset marketing claims or make any commitments about future 
advertising.
The motion follows the Court's decision in July, pursuant to which Dutch environmental groups Fossielvrij and 
Reclame Fossielvrij were granted permission to bring a class action lawsuit based on their complaint against KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines for violating the European Unfair Consumer Practices Directive. KLM's 'Fly Responsibly' 
campaign was comprised of 19 advertisements promoting its use of sustainable aviation fuel, reforestation and 
onboard changes to reduce its carbon footprint. The Dutch carrier opposed the claims, and in a statement, said: 
'The court declared Fossilvrij's claims admissible. That only means that Fossielvrij may continue with the 
procedure. KLM is ambitious when it comes to its climate approach and would like to involve its customers in the 
subject...We no longer use the 19 communications that are central to this case. We look forward to the substantive 
handling of the case with confidence.'
The case is one of several commenced against airlines based on alleged greenwashing. For instance, in 2020, the 
UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) censured Ryanair based on a finding that the airline made misleading 
and unsubstantiated comparative claims in its 2019 advertising touting that it was "Europe's lowest emissions 
airline." In April 2023, ASA found that two of Etihad Airways' claims concerning "sustainable aviation" lacked 
context and exaggerated the immediate positive environmental impact of flying the airline and were therefore 
misleading. And a month earlier, the ASA found that Lufthansa's advertising claim 'Connecting the world. Protecting 
its future,' in the context in which it was presented, could be understood by consumers as an environmental claim 
and that it was misleading because it suggested that Lufthansa had already taken action to mitigate its 
environmental impact, but that the airline's initiatives found on its website through a link in the advertisement were 
aspirational.
Airlines Face Increasing Greenwashing Challenges
Greenwashing in the transportation sector, and in particular in the airline industry, has also caught the attention of 
consumer protection regulators in other jurisdictions. The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets 
recently warned Ryanair that its sustainability claims related to carbon offsets were misleading. The ACM's findings 
were part of an investigation into carbon offset advertising claims across the Dutch aviation industry. The consumer 
regulator concluded that Ryanair's claims might give would-be passengers the false impression that they could 'fly 
greener' on the airline - in other words, that it was significantly more sustainable to fly Ryanair than other, 
supposedly less sustainable airlines.
Taking the Temperature: We have previously discussed  other litigation and regulatory action against airlines 
relating to sustainability statements. In July 2023, the Bureau Europen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC), an 
umbrella entity for European independent consumer organizations, filed a complaint on behalf of itself and 23 of its 
member organizations from 19 countries with the European Commission and relevant consumer protection 
agencies, accusing 17 European airlines of greenwashing in connection with their marketing practices, in breach of 
the EU regulations governing unfair commercial practices.
In the United States, a consumer class action was filed in California federal court , alleging that Delta Air Lines 
falsely claimed that it is the world's 'first carbon-neutral airline.' The plaintiff, on behalf of a putative class of 
California consumers who purchased a ticket on Delta Airlines after March 6, 2020, claims that Delta relied on 
carbon credits to offset its reported emissions, but the benefits from those carbon credits are exaggerated, 
therefore, rendering Delta's reported emissions data misleading.
As we have been reporting, greenwashing in general is a key concern for companies across all sectors. The 
European Union has an ongoing legislative campaign  to challenge misleading sustainability claims in advertising. 
Outside the EU, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) earlier this year released updated guidance  for 
advertisers making environmental sustainability-related claims to consumers, including use of the terms 'carbon 
neutral' and 'net zero.' And in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission announced that it is seeking public comment  
on potential revisions to its Green Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, in particular to address 
carbon offsets and climate change-related marketing claims. Likewise, in July 2023, the Australian Competition and 
Consumer Commission  released draft guidance  for businesses making environmental and sustainability claims 
(the Draft Greenwashing Guidance). The Draft Greenwashing Guidance establishes best practices under the 
Australian Consumer Law setting out how businesses operating in Australian jurisdictions can avoid greenwashing.
In addition, as we have noted , research shows an accelerating trend in climate-related litigation of all kinds, 
greenwashing suits among them. One significant driver of litigation overall is the publicity generated, and 
greenwashing litigation in particular threatens adverse reputational impact.

Leading international airlines have suspended or reduced flights to Israel's capital Tel Aviv amid the   and 
escalating attacks on Gaza 
About half of all scheduled flights at the airport did not operate on Sunday and a third were cancelled as of Monday 
evening.
American Airlines, Air Canada, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Egypt Air, Emirates, Finland's Finnair, Dutch carrier 
KLM, Germany's Lufthansa, Norwegian Air, Portugal's TAP, Polish carrier LOT, Ryanair and United Airlines were 
among those suspending or reducing flight to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.
Russia banned night flights to Israel and regulators including the US Federal Aviation Authority, the European 
Union Aviation Safety Agency and Israel's aviation authority urged airlines to use caution in Israeli airspace but 
stopped short of suspending flights.
Russia said it had restricted flights from going to Israel before 09:00 GMT due to what it called an "unstable political 
and military situation" and advised airlines to continue to monitor risks during daylight hours.
Israel's civil aviation authority said airlines should "review current security and threat information" and had changed 
some air traffic routes. The authority noted that delays should be expected and advised airlines flying to Israel to 
carry extra fuel as a precaution.
British Airways said it was planning to continue operating flights to Israel "over the coming days with adjusted 
departure times".
Virgin Atlantic said it would continue to run some flights but that customers could rebook or request a refund on 
their tickets.
The United Kingdom's easyJet halted flights to Tel Aviv on Sunday and Monday, and Hungarian budget carrier 
Wizz Air cancelled flights to and from Tel Aviv until further notice. Other airlines suspending flights included 
Aegean, Swiss and Austrian Airlines.

Airlines flying from China, Hong Kong and South Korea also cancelled flights to Tel Aviv.
Hong Kong's main carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, said that "in view of the latest situation in Israel", it was 
cancelling its Tel Aviv flights scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday.
"The safety of our passengers and crew are our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely," 
the airline said on its website, adding it would provide updates on the site.
Israel's national carrier El Al said that it was maintaining its Tel Aviv flights for now, "in accordance with the 
instructions of the Israeli security forces", with all flights now departing only from Terminal Three at  .

Several airlines canceled flights to and from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel's busiest airport, in recent days 
over the escalating war between Israel and Hamas .
Why it matters: With hundreds of flights canceled, thousands of people from other countries may be temporarily 
stranded inside Israel  as Hamas rocket barrages  continue to hammer the country's missile defense system.
Fighting erupted after Hamas launched a major surprise attack on Israel over the weekend, killing and kidnapping 
soldiers and civilians. At least 11 Americans were killed  and President Biden said on Monday that it is likely U.S. 
citizens are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces  said on Tuesday that more than 4,500 rockets have been fired from Gaza since the 
start of the attack, some of which made it past Israel's Iron Dome system .
Israel has responded with a intensifying bombardment of strikes on Gaza, a densely-populated Hamas-run enclave 
home to about 2 million Palestinians. It's also imposed an "complete siege" on Gaza, cutting electricity and blocking 
the entry of food, fuel and supplies.

Oct 09, 2023( Climate Home News: http://www.climatechangenews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 A wave of anti-'greenwashing' litigation[1] is seeking to hold major players in the aviation industry to account for 
sensational claims of being sustainable, low-carbon or contributing to net zero. 
While the industry has faced legal backlash in the past, the dramatic proliferation of these cases may spell disaster 
for major airlines. 
It's not hard to see why the aviation industry has provoked the ire of climate activists. Flying is responsible for a 
staggering 5% or so of human-induced global warming[2] and its climate impact is still growing at a rate far greater 
than almost any other sector. 
In this context, a profusion of 'green flying' and 'sustainability' advertising campaigns has turned the industry into an 
emblematic example of the debate between growth and sustainability. 
Why greenwashing? 
The rise in greenwashing litigation can in part be attributed to the relative ease with which cases can be brought. It's 
simply a lot easier to attack an airline's advertising compared to other activities that might be targeted by strategic 
climate litigation. 
Consumers can use legal mechanisms such as commercial practice or consumer protection regulations, as 
happened in a recent greenwashing complaint to the European Commission[3] filed by consumer groups in 19 
countries against 17 airlines. 
It's an effective form of climate action due to the power exerted by advertising on public perception and social 
norms. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[4] (IPCC) has underscored the importance of 
reducing demand for flying in the first place, something significantly hindered by adverts that downplay its 
environmental impact. 
Exposed: carbon offsets linked to high forest loss still on sale[5] 
A report[6] by Greenpeace and think tank the New Weather Institute[7] claimed that in 2019 airline advertisements 
influenced 34 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent emissions worldwide. 
This litigation is also buoyed by the demonstrable falsehoods that riddle the sustainability strategies of these 
companies. The pillars upon which their net-zero strategies rest vary from the broadly ineffective[8] to the 
dangerously fraudulent[9] and facilitate growth in a sector in dire need of reduction. 
Why airlines are perfect targets for anti-greenwashing legal action
Airlines all rely on some form of carbon offsetting - planting trees, for instance, to 'offset' the carbon emitted by the 
planes - or sustainable aviation fuel or carbon capture and storage, in order to 'mitigate' their climate impacts. 
Common litigation strategies 
Thus far, there have been six climate change-related cases brought against major airlines (four in Europe, one in 
the US and one in Brazil). These cases are buttressed by numerous legal complaints taken through the European 
Commission or the UK and US advertising standards boards which have already successfully ordered Ryanair[10], 
Lufthansa[11] and Etihad[12] to pull ad campaigns. 
In each of these three cases, authorities found that terminology like 'protecting the future', 'sustainable aviation' or 
'low-emissions airline' amounted to wilful misleading of consumers and breached advertising regulations. 
A recent case taken by Dutch campaigners against airline giant KLM[13] is the most daring example yet. Climate 
action group FossielVrij[14](Fossil-free) argues that KLM's 'Fly Responsibly' campaign constitutes misleading 
advertising under EU consumer law. 
Following coup, Gabon climate officials face corruption allegations[15] 
The group asserts that flying responsibly is impossible at present, and that KLM seeks company growth and 
increased flight sales, when it should be reducing emissions by reducing the number of flights. KLM said[16] its 
'communications comply with the applicable legislation and regulations', but has dropped the Fly Responsibly 
campaign. 
Interestingly, this case builds upon a ruling of the Dutch Advertisement Code Commission[17] and indicates the 
'snowballing' trend inherent in anti-greenwashing litigation, wherein cases rely upon precedent set by previous 
authorities. With this borne in mind, the recent 19-country complaint by the European Consumer Organisation could 
provide the strongest foundation to date for future litigation. 
Delta Airlines is also facing a class action suit in the US[18], brought by a California resident who alleges that by 
marketing itself as a 'carbon-neutral' Delta has grossly misrepresented its environmental impact. This points to a 
growing understanding of the ineffectiveness of carbon offsetting[19], a net-zero tactic adopted by almost every 
major airline. 
A Delta spokesperson[20] said the case is 'without legal merit' as the airline has 'transitioned its focus away from 
carbon offsets' towards decarbonising its own activities. European companies should follow this case closely as 
American-style 'class action' litigation will soon be made possible in the EU[21]. 
Does this litigation have teeth? 
These cases might result in companies simply pulling their green campaign while maintaining their existing 
corporate framework and growth models. More promisingly, recent research[22] suggests that any climate-related 
case taken against a major emitting company will affect the firm's value (on average by 0.057% following the filing 
of a case, and by 1.5% following an unfavourable decision). 
In reality, these early cases are merely scratching the surface of what's possible. Once these cases enter the public 
conversation, a growing understanding of consumer protection is bound to follow. 
Green Climate Fund ambition at risk after 'disappointing' pledges[23] 
In many jurisdictions, such as my home country of Ireland, significant damages can be awarded against companies 
for misleading advertisement. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which is currently investigating claims 
of greenwashing in other sectors, will soon be able to fine companies 10% of their global turnover[24] for non-
compliance. 
While anti-greenwashing litigation might not halt the growth of this industry altogether, it is no doubt an invaluable 
tool. At its most effective, it can stop blatant profiteering from the climate crisis and force the aviation sector to 
confront the chimera that is green growth.

with missile strikes.
Body
Foreign airlines have suspended flights into Israel following Palestinian fundamentalist group Hamas' surprise 
attack, but Tel Aviv's largest airport Ben Gurion remains open as Israeli carriers run emergency flights for citizens 
abroad. Yesterday evening (8 October), the Izzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, targeted Ben 
Gurion with a missile attack, claiming responsibility on Telegram. Unverified social media footage shows further 
strikes today (9 October). Izzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said on Telegram: "The Al-Qassam Brigades bombed the 
Zionist Ben Gurion Airport with a missile barrage in response to the continuing crimes and targeting of civilian 
homes."Arkia Airlines and IsraAir have announced emergency flights to return Israelis abroad to Tel Aviv. El-Al, the 
country's flag carrier airline, said it "might cancel flights to places where we don't have a lot of Israelis to help other 
Israelis in other places." 
John Grant, Senior Aviation Analyst at OAG, forecasted this will cause a "significant and damaging loss on the [El-
Al] airline for some time ahead". More than 700 people in Israel and 400 in Gaza have been killed as air strikes and 
military operations escalate. Thousands more have been injured, and hundreds reportedly taken hostage. Will 
Israel suspend air travel?The Israel Airports Authority (IAA) insists that Ben Gurion airport remains open. Dozens of 
flights have been cancelled as thousands flock to Tel Aviv's international hub in an attempt to flee the country,

https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oCMmp/1 Questions have been raised over how long the IAA can safely keep Ben 
Gurion airport open as Hamas launches repeated strikes. The airport's closure will only be avoided "as long as the 
airport authorities can operate the airport safely and without risk to passengers, airlines, employees and aircraft", 
said Grant. "This is unlikely to be very long, if at all." https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1710583005230575705 
Earlier today (9 October), Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a "complete siege" on the Gaza Strip. 
Israel controls Gaza's air space and border crossings and has already cut electricity, fuel and food supply lines. 
60,000 passengers passed through Ben Gurion airport yesterday (8 October). The IAA announced that only

Terminal 3 is operating while Terminal 1 is temporarily closed. United Airlines, Emirates, Ryanair, Lufthansa, Air 
France and American Airlines are among the foreign carriers that have suspended flights into Israel indefinitely. 
https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EigpO/1/ Border closures or religious rights?The government's continued offer of 
emergency flights for Israelis abroad is motivated in part by the 'Law of Return'. Also known as the Right of Aliyah, 
this law gives "every Jew in the world the right to settle in Israel" and has been enshrined in Israel's constitution 
since 1950. The Israeli government is attempting to counterbalance this religious right with national security 
interests. "Israel declaring a national state of emergency means borders could close at very short notice," said 
Nicholas Wyatt, Head of Analysis for GlobalData Travel and Tourism. "This, along with the obvious safety concerns, 
will deter many travellers." https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/d1AWg/3/ Wyatt pointed to foreign governments' travel 
advisory warnings as another factor behind cancellations. "The UK is advising against all but essential travel to 
Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, while the US has issued a 'Do not travel to' advisory for Gaza, and 
an 'exercise increased caution' advisory for Israel", he said. "In the past, most travellers have taken heed of such 
advisories." Qatar's foreign ministry is reportedly attempting to serve as mediator in talks between Hamas and 
Israeli officials. All eyes now look to the Israeli security forces' decision on international air travel amid what Tel-
Aviv's ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan has called "Israel's 9/11". Our signals coverage is powered by

On September 27, 2023, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines filed a request with the Amsterdam District Court, asking it to 
dismiss a greenwashing suit brought by environmental activist groups. According to a statement by ClientEarth , 
which represents the groups, in 2019 KLM dropped its 'Fly Responsibly' advertising campaign after the groups filed 
a petition but the carrier did not address carbon offset marketing claims or make any commitments about future 
advertising.
The motion follows the Court's decision in July, pursuant to which Dutch environmental groups Fossielvrij and 
Reclame Fossielvrij were granted permission to bring a class action lawsuit based on their complaint against KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines for violating the European Unfair Consumer Practices Directive. KLM's 'Fly Responsibly' 
campaign was comprised of 19 advertisements promoting its use of sustainable aviation fuel, reforestation and 
onboard changes to reduce its carbon footprint. The Dutch carrier opposed the claims, and in a statement, said: 
'The court declared Fossilvrij's claims admissible. That only means that Fossielvrij may continue with the 
procedure.KLM is ambitious when it comes to its climate approach and would like to involve its customers in the 
subject...We no longer use the 19 communications that are central to this case. We look forward to the substantive 
handling of the case with confidence.'
The case is one of several commenced against airlines based on alleged greenwashing. For instance, in 2020, the 
UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) censured Ryanair based on a finding that the airline made misleading 
and unsubstantiated comparative claims in its 2019 advertising touting that it was "Europe's lowest emissions 
Airlines Face Increasing Greenwashing Challenges
airline." In April 2023, ASA found that two of Etihad Airways' claims concerning "sustainable aviation" lacked 
context and exaggerated the immediate positive environmental impact of flying the airline and were therefore 
misleading. And a month earlier, the ASA found that Lufthansa's advertising claim 'Connecting the world. Protecting 
its future,' in the context in which it was presented, could be understood by consumers as an environmental claim 
and that it was misleading because it suggested that Lufthansa had already taken action to mitigate its 
environmental impact, but that the airline's initiatives found on its website through a link in the advertisement were 
aspirational.
Greenwashing in the transportation sector, and in particular in the airline industry, has also caught the attention of 
consumer protection regulators in other jurisdictions. The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets 
recently warned Ryanair that its sustainability claims related to carbon offsets were misleading. The ACM's findings 
were part of an investigation into carbon offset advertising claims across the Dutch aviation industry. The consumer 
regulator concluded that Ryanair's claims might give would-be passengers the false impression that they could 'fly 
greener' on the airline - in other words, that it was significantly more sustainable to fly Ryanair than other, 
supposedly less sustainable airlines.
Taking the Temperature:  We have previously discussed  other litigation and regulatory action against airlines 
relating to sustainability statements. In July 2023, the Bureau Europen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC), an 
umbrella entity for European independent consumer organizations, filed a complaint on behalf of itself and 23 of its 
member organizations from 19 countries with the European Commission and relevant consumer protection 
agencies, accusing 17 European airlines of greenwashing in connection with their marketing practices, in breach of 
the EU regulations governing unfair commercial practices.
In the United States,  a consumer class action was filed in California federal court , alleging that Delta Air Lines 
falsely claimed that it is the world's 'first carbon-neutral airline.' The plaintiff, on behalf of a putative class of 
California consumers who purchased a ticket on Delta Airlines after March 6, 2020, claims that Delta relied on 
carbon credits to offset its reported emissions, but the benefits from those carbon credits are exaggerated, 
therefore, rendering Delta's reported emissions data misleading.
As we have been reporting, greenwashing in general is a key concern for companies across all sectors. The 
European Union has an  ongoing legislative campaign  to challenge misleading sustainability claims in advertising. 
Outside the EU, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) earlier this year  released updated guidance  for 
advertisers making environmental sustainability-related claims to consumers, including use of the terms 'carbon 
neutral' and 'net zero.' And in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission announced that it is  seeking public 
comment  on potential revisions to its Green Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, in particular to 
address carbon offsets and climate change-related marketing claims. Likewise, in July 2023, the  Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission  released  draft guidance  for businesses making environmental and 
sustainability claims (the Draft Greenwashing Guidance). The Draft Greenwashing Guidance establishes best 
practices under the Australian Consumer Law setting out how businesses operating in Australian jurisdictions can 
avoid greenwashing.
In addition,  as we have noted , research shows an accelerating trend in climate-related litigation of all kinds, 
greenwashing suits among them. One significant driver of litigation overall is the publicity generated, and 
greenwashing litigation in particular threatens adverse reputational impact.

Several major US airlines, including United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, have temporarily 
suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv, Israel due to the ongoing security concerns in the region. The decision 
comes in the wake of a surprise attack by Hamas militants on Saturday, during which thousands of rockets were 
fired from Gaza into Israeli towns.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice on Saturday Oct. 7, urging US carriers to exercise 
caution when operating in the airspace of Tel Aviv. The FAA is closely monitoring the situation and will provide 
updates as needed.
This move by US airlines follows similar decisions by international carriers like Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates, and 
Ryanair. Additionally, Air Canada has announced the temporary cancellation of flights to Tel Aviv starting on 
Sunday Oct. 8. Notably, Turkish Airlines has not made any changes to its flights to Israel.
It's important to note that Ben Gurion International Airport, the primary airport serving Tel Aviv, remains open, 
though some flights have been redirected to other airports worldwide. El Al, Israel's national airline, is offering 
flexible options for passengers who wish to change or cancel their flights.
These flight disruptions come amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Hamas, resulting in casualties and 
injuries in both Gaza and Israel. The United Nations Security Council is convening an emergency meeting on 
Sunday to address the ongoing crisis.

This move by US airlines follows similar decisions by international carriers like Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates, and 
Ryanair. Additionally, Air Canada has announced the temporary cancellation of flights to Tel Aviv starting on 
Sunday Oct. 8. Notably, Turkish Airlines has not made any changes to its flights to Israel.
It's important to note that Ben Gurion International Airport, the primary airport serving Tel Aviv, remains open, 
though some flights have been redirected to other airports worldwide. El Al, Israel's national airline, is offering 
flexible options for passengers who wish to change or cancel their flights.
These flight disruptions come amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Hamas, resulting in casualties and 
injuries in both Gaza and Israel. The United Nations Security Council is convening an emergency meeting on 
Sunday to address the ongoing crisis.

Several major US airlines, including United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, have temporarily 
suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv, Israel due to the ongoing security concerns in the region. The decision 
comes in the wake of a surprise attack by Hamas militants on Saturday, during which thousands of rockets were 
fired from Gaza into Israeli towns.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice on Saturday Oct. 7, urging US carriers to exercise 
caution when operating in the airspace of Tel Aviv. The FAA is closely monitoring the situation and will provide

Airlines' losses from NATS failure to be considered - regulator
Airlines' losses from NATS failure to be considered - regulator

Britain's Civil Aviation Authority has confirmed that the cost of flight cancellations to airlines after air traffic control 
systems failed in August will be considered in an ongoing review.
After the likes of Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC called on the regulator to hold air traffic 
controller NATS responsible for the system glitch which prompted thousands of flights to be cancelled, the CAA 
gave an update on Friday.
"Airline and airport costs of providing care, assistance, and re-routing to consumers" will be considered, the 
regulator said.
According to the trade body, International Air Transport Association, the cost to airlines of the cancellations, which 
affected some 300,000, could be in the region of £100 million.
These were caused by the shutdown of the NATS flight planning system on Monday, August 28, which stopped 
working when some incorrect data was received.
As a result, air traffic controllers were left manually inputting flight data and limiting traffic for several hours during 
the afternoon.
Though resolved later that day, the incident led to travel chaos for the best part of a week as airlines worked to 
repatriate passengers who had missed flights.
Airlines are legally required to accommodate and feed passengers whose flights are cancelled.
Airlines' losses from NATS failure to be considered - regulator
Recommendations will be made based on the CAA's ongoing review, which was confirmed to have begun on 
Friday. 
"This event had a significant impact on many passengers, businesses and the aviation industry and it is clear 
lessons need to be learnt," review panel chair Jeff Halliwell said. 
Shares in easyJet and Ryanair rose by 2.3% and 1.9% respectively on Friday.

 In the past week, Air Canada's ACDVF[1] pilots demonstrated at Toronto's Pearson Airport, demanding higher pay, 
job security and better working conditions. Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] featured in the news following 
its bearish guidance for the third quarter of 2023. 
Joby Aviation JOBY[3] took a step toward fulfilling its goal of commercial operations when it expanded the scope of

prior guidance (earlier estimate was a decline of 4-8%). 
Non-fuel unit cost for the September quarter is now expected to be near the high end of the prior view (the earlier 
estimate was a 2.5-5.5% increase). With oil prices moving north, JetBlue raised its fuel cost per gallon guidance for 
the third quarter and now anticipates[5] fuel price per gallon to be around $2.95 (prior view: $2.75-$2.90 band).

2. Air Canada's pilots have received a 2% wage increase per year since 2014. The contract ended on Sep 29. The 
union believes that the ongoing talks, which have been going on since June 2023, will continue throughout October, 
leaving them without a contract. With no breakthrough yet, pilots of ACDVF are naturally pressing for a new pay-
related contract. The recent lucrative deals inked by its counterparts in the United States also acted as a catalyst[7] 
behind their decision to protest. 
Air Canada has also been in the news recently due to its fleet upgrade efforts. The news was covered in detail in 
the previous week's write-up[8]. 
3. In September, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights was 17.4 million, reflecting a 9% year-over-
year increase. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 94% in September 2023. The 
reading was similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 97,350 flights in September 2023.

4. Most of Joby Aviation's testing has been completed remotely from a ground control station by using modern 
communications technology and software. This remote testing allowed JOBY to generate a large amount of data on 
the performance of the aircraft through a variety of flight conditions. The pilot-on-board campaign was led by its 
Chief Test Pilot, James Denham. The campaign was designed to collect information[9] on the aircraft's handling 
qualities and pilot control interfaces. Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major

The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red in the past week. As a result, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index declined 3.2% over the period to $52.58. Over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker 
declined 6.9%.

Delta Air Lines DAL[10] is scheduled to kickstart the third-quarter earnings season for airlines on Oct 12. While 
passenger revenues are likely to have been impressive, high fuel costs are expected[11] to have dented DAL's

 It's a small airline with just eight aircraft and that is to remain the same, but a lot is about to change for Air Malta[1], 
the national carrier of the island of Malta in the Mediterranean. After many years of struggling and failed rescue 
attempts, the current airline will be dissolved on March 30, only to be succeeded the next day by a new airline that 
will likely continue to operate under the same Air Malta brand. 
The Maltese government announced the plans for the new national airline earlier this week. This follows two difficult 
years for Air Malta, in which it not only felt the effects of the pandemic but faced fierce competition from Ryanair 
subsidiary Malta Air and other low-cost airlines like Wizz Air and easyJet. Wizz Air[2] but also Lufthansa have 
established subsidiaries in Malta.

Ryanair has secured a victory in a Spanish commercial court, which rejected an injunction sought by online travel 
agency (OTA) Kiwi. The court ruled against suspending Ryanair's verification procedures for passengers booked 
through OTAs, stating that Ryanair does not have a commercial relationship with Kiwi.
While Ryanair welcomed the decision, Kiwi emphasized that the court did not assess the validity of the verification 
process but only considered the request for an urgent suspension. Kiwi continues to challenge Ryanair's verification 
process for indirect customers, highlighting concerns about the collection of personal information and additional 
fees charged at the airport.
The case is part of Ryanair's broader efforts to combat what it alleges are deceptive practices by OTAs, including 
false advertising of lower fares and withholding booking details from passengers. The airline has been urging 
consumers to book directly to avoid inaccuracies and additional fees associated with third-party platforms.

Teesside Airport is UK's 'most recovered' as passenger numbers take off
Teesside Airport is UK's 'most recovered' as passenger numbers take off

Oct 05, 2023( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 A surge in holiday demand has helped award-winning Teesside International Airport enjoy the biggest recovery in 
passenger numbers of any UK airport. 
The airport has seen passenger numbers soar by 96 per cent since 2019. It is by far the biggest increase by a UK 
airport in a period which the industry suffered the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The official figures show major progress being made in the long-term turnaround plan and come as the airport 
celebrates being named UK and Irish Airport of the Year. 
Civil Aviation Authority data showed 25,369 passengers passed through the airport in July, compared with fewer 
than 13,000 in 2019. Teesside was one of just six of 35 UK airports to exceed its pre-pandemic figures and bucked 
the national trend which has seen a 6 per cent drop in overall air travel. 
Separately, the airport also enjoyed its best month since 2010 in September beating the previous record set only in 
June, as the total exceeded 27,000. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: 'These figures show that our turnaround plan is working by delivering the 
flights and services that people want from their local airport. We have worked incredibly hard to recover from the 
impact of the pandemic and it's fantastic that we've achieved by far the biggest bounce-back of any airport in the 
country. 
'This is only the start. We want more great destinations to make sure we grow these numbers. This growth - 
alongside our development as a great location for businesses - will help us deliver on our plan to return the airport 
to profit.' 
The rise in passenger numbers has been fuelled by an enhanced package of holiday flights, with thousands of 
families jetting off to the sun. This summer has seen the airport enjoy its busiest period since returning to public 
ownership in 2019 and is on course to record its busiest year since 2011. 
Holiday hotspots with airline Ryanair to Alicante, Faro in Portugal, Majorca, and Corfu have proved popular. TUI 
has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity 
of the route last year and a service to Antalya, Turkey. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are using KLM's three-times daily 
service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Teesside Airport is UK's 'most recovered' as passenger numbers take off
Phil Forster, Teesside International airport managing director, said: 'These figures confirm how Teesside is moving 
firmly in the right direction. We are confident that we can now build on this success by adding more flights so 
passengers will make Teesside their first choice thanks to the fantastic experience of flying from our airport.' 
Teesside was named UK and Irish Airport of the Year at the TTG Travel Industry Awards in London after winning 
recognition for its growth in flights and delivering a great passenger experience. 
It is also in the running for the British Travel Awards for Best UK Airport, and is the only national airport going up 
against global competition in the International Airport Review's Airport Experience Award. Major progress has been 
made in developing the airport as a key location for businesses as part of the ten-year plan to return to profit. 
Work is now almost complete on the link road and first unit on the 200m Business Park South on the airport's 
southside, which is set to create 4,400 jobs when fully operational while new hangars are also being developed on 
the northside of the airport.

Scandinavian carrier SAS wipes out shareholders as Air France-KLM takes 
stake in rescue deal; Airlines

Scandinavian airline SAS is wiping out existing shareholders as part of a rescue deal that involves bigger rival Air 
France-KLM and private equity firm Castlelake becoming new major investors alongside the Danish state.
The struggling airline said yesterday that it would receive $475mn in new equity and $700mn in convertible debt as 
part of the deal, taking it off the stock exchange with no payment to current shareholders and little to bondholders.
Castlelake will become the biggest shareholder with a 32 per cent stake as well as a majority owner of the 
convertible debt. Air France-KLM would own 20 per cent, while the Danish government - the sole Scandinavian 
nation still invested in the airline - would own 26 per cent. The Swedish government's stake will be wiped out under 
the proposed deal, which SAS said did not need approval of existing shareholders.
The airline will move from its current Star Alliance group to Air France-KLM's SkyTeam as part of a transaction that 
it hopes will finally take it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after more than a year. "This is a significant 
achievement of our transformation plan, SAS Forward," said chair Carsten Dilling. He added that securing new 
capital should help "facilitate our emergence from the US Chapter 11 process".
Alex Irving, analyst at Bernstein, said that SAS had missed out by not being part of a large network or global joint 
venture and so had been left as a "subscale airline". He added: "Following Air France's own remarkable turnaround, 
can it work the same magic on another group long challenged by restrictive unions and with low margins?"
Scandinavian carrier SAS wipes out shareholders as Air France-KLM takes stake in rescue deal; Airlines
SAS has struggled for more than a decade with high costs and weak profitability and filed for bankruptcy protection 
last July in the US as it sought new owners after the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent stop in much of global 
travel pushed it over the edge.
The Norwegian government had already sold out of SAS and the Swedish state indicated that it would put in no 
fresh money, leaving Denmark alone of the three countries that founded the airline in 1946.
The latest deal in the airline industry shows how legacy carriers in Europe are consolidating around three players: 
Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM, Germany's Lufthansa and Anglo-Spanish IAG.
The traditional airline industry has struggled to fight off the threat of lowcost airlines such as Ryanair, Wizz Air, and 
in SAS's own backyard Norwegian
Air. The latter itself came out of bankruptcy protection two years ago, after trying to crack the lucrative transatlantic 
market before throwing in the towel.
Benjamin Smith, chief executive of Air France-KLM, which paid $145mn for its stake and some convertible debt, 
said: "Air France-KLM looks forward to establishing strong commercial ties with SAS.
"With its well-established position in Scandinavia and strong brand, SAS offers tremendous potential to Air France-
KLM."
Hybrid bondholders in SAS should expect a "modest recovery", the airline said, while unsecured creditors would 
receive 5-20 per cent of the nominal value of their claims.

Wizz Air passengers jump by a fifth as slowdown concerns batted off
Wizz Air passengers jump by a fifth as slowdown concerns batted off

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) has reported that the number of passengers booked on its flights jumped by a 
fifth in September, as capacity and load factors also grew.
Some 5.5 million passengers booked on September flights with Wizz Air, up 21.1% on last year, while the airline's 
capacity climbed by 14.1% to just shy of 6 million.
Load factor increased from 87.1% to 92.4% meanwhile, batting off concerns that the industry could be hit if pent-up 
demand from the pandemic plateaus.
Though the rate of growth slowed marginally, Liberum analysts pointed out, this is unlikely to translate into any 
material downturn.
"The strong improvement in the load factor continued to recent trend and brought Wizz Air into line with peers on 
this front," the investment bank added.
Rival Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) also reported 9% growth in passenger numbers during September, to 17.4 
million, while load factor sat stubbornly at 94%, further calming concerns that the sector's recovery could be short-
lived.
"Fundamentally there are storm clouds gathering though," Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates 
warned, citing growing strain on household finances from higher interest.
Wizz Air passengers jump by a fifth as slowdown concerns batted off
Travel stocks could face setbacks heading into the new year as a result, she said, with volatility likely as household 
spending is squeezed by increased mortgage rates when coming to renew.
Wizz Air is yet to feel the full effects of groundings due to suspected contaminants in its Pratt & Whitney-powered 
aircraft meanwhile, due to take place in the coming years.
How costly these reductions in capacity will be remains to be seen, with analysts most recently predicting the airline 
has plans in place to mitigate the effects.

Ryanair Holdings, a major player in the low-cost airline sector, has announced significant adjustments to its Winter 
2023/24 season schedule due to delays in the delivery of its new B737-8-200 aircraft. The airline now anticipates 
receiving only 14 aircraft by the end of the year, half of its initial plan, impacting its winter operations.
Group CEO Michael O'Leary expressed regret over the production issues affecting Boeing's deliveries to Ryanair, 
citing problems in Wichita and Seattle. O'Leary stated, "We are in regular dialogue with Boeing, and our primary 
objective is to ensure we get delivery of all 57 contracted B737 aircraft before the end of May 2024."
Originally expecting 27 new aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an additional 30 by May 2024, Ryanair is 
actively collaborating with Boeing to ensure the fleet reaches its projected size by the peak of the Summer 2024 
season.
To manage the situation, the carrier will reduce the number of aircraft based at various locations, including Brussels 
Charleroi, Dublin International, Naples Capodichino, Pisa, Milan Bergamo, Cologne/Bonn, Porto, and Nottingham 
East Midlands. Ryanair emphasizes that necessary maintenance ahead of the busier summer season has left no 
spare aircraft this winter.
The airline group has already incorporated 124 B737-8-200s into its fleet, distributed among Ryanair, Buzz 
(Poland), and Malta Air AOCs. With an additional 86 units on order from Boeing, the B737-8-200 complements the 
existing fleet of 392 B737-800s and twenty-eight A320-200s operated by Lauda Europe. Ryanair also operates a 
single B737-700 on the Polish AOC for training, corporate, and backup purposes.
As the airline navigates the challenges posed by the Boeing delivery delays, passengers and stakeholders can 
expect updates on Ryanair's winter schedule adjustments and ongoing efforts to secure timely aircraft deliveries. 
Stay tuned for further developments in this dynamic situation.

Oct 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported solid traffic numbers for September, driven by upbeat air-travel demand. The 
number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in September was 17.4 million, implying that 9% more passengers 
flew than a year ago. 
Although RYAAY's traffic has shown year-over-year growth, it has declined sequentially, mainly due to air traffic 
control strikes. The September figure compares unfavorably with the August 2023 figure of 18.9 million and the July 
figure of 18.7 million. The figure came in line with the June 2023 figure of 17.4 million. 
The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 94% in September 2023. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period. RYAAY operated more than 97,350 flights in September 2023. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 29.2% so far this year compared with 0.6% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair expects its traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. In spite of upbeat passenger volumes, RYAAY 
continues to be hurt due to headwinds like air traffic control strikes and further probable Boeing delivery delays. 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are GATX Corporation (GATX), Westinghouse 
Air Brake Technologies Corporation, operating as Wabtec Corporation (WAB) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW). Each of 
these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[4]. 
GATX has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.33% for the current year. GATX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 17.30%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX's current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the past 90 days. 
Shares of GATX have gained 1.3% year to date. 
Wabtec has an expected earnings growth rate of 16.87% for the current year. WAB delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 3.42%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB's current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of WAB have gained 5.5% year to date. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) September Traffic Increases From 2022 Levels
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable.A fall in operating expenses is a tailwind for SkyWest. In 
second-quarter 2023, the metric dipped 2.4% to $693.8 million due to a decline in operating costs. Low operating 
expenses boost bottom-line results. Shares of SKYW have surged 149.8% year to date. 
SKYW delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31.51%, on average. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's credited with a 'watershed medical breakthrough' and is developing a bustling pipeline of other projects that 
could make a world of difference for patients suffering from diseases involving the liver, lungs, and blood. This is a 
timely investment that you can catch while it emerges from its bear market lows. 
 It could rival or surpass other recent Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in 
little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top Stock And 4

European Court Rejects Ryanair 's Appeal Against SAS State Aid

The Court of Justice of the European Union has upheld the dismissal of Ryanair's appeal challenging the state aid 
granted to SAS Scandinavian Airlines by Denmark and Sweden. The aid, totaling SEK 1.5 billion kroner (USD 137 
million), was provided as compensation for losses incurred due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In its ruling on September 28, the court in Luxembourg deemed Ryanair's grounds of appeal as unfounded, 
rejecting all arguments put forward by the low-cost carrier. The decision affirmed the judgments of the European 
General Court, emphasizing that the aid measures were specifically targeted at SAS and did not violate EU law.
Ryanair had filed the appeal in May 2021, contending that the General Court had made errors in dismissing the 
case earlier that year. The General Court's ruling had concluded that the state aid complied with EU regulations, 
highlighting SAS's higher market share and greater susceptibility to pandemic-related restrictions compared to its 
closest competitor in Denmark and Sweden.
The aid, approved by the European Commission on April 15, 2020, took the form of a guarantee on a revolving 
credit facility. Ryanair has been actively pursuing legal action against the European Commission and several 
airlines concerning state aid granted by European governments, with over a dozen lawsuits filed to date. The recent 
decision underscores the regulatory support for targeted assistance to airlines facing substantial challenges during 
the ongoing aviation crisis.

Boeing lowers 737 Max target for 2023

Boeing has cut expected 2023 deliveries for the Boeing 737 Max to between 375-400 from 400-450 previously.
The US manufacturer said it previously flagged a supplier non-conformance for certain 737 aircraft during the third 
quarter.
"Near-term deliveries and production will be impacted as the program performs necessary inspections and rework, 
and the company now expects to deliver 375-400 airplanes this year," Boeing said.
"On production, suppliers are continuing with planned rate increases, and the company expects to complete the 
final assembly transition to 38 per month by year-end, with plans to increase to 50 per month in the 2025/2026 
timeframe."
On the widebody side, however, Boeing still expects to deliver between 70-80 787s this year.
The 787 program is now transitioning production to five per month and plans to increase to 10 per month in the 
2025/2026 timeframe.
During the quarter, Boeing booked 398 net orders on the commercial side, including 150 737 Max 10s for Ryanair, 
50 787s for United Airlines, and 39 787s for Saudi Arabian Airlines. 
The company delivered 105 aircraft during the quarter, down 6%, and the backlog included over 5,100 aircraft 
valued at $392 billion, including 19 787-family aircraft.
Commercial third quarter revenue increased 25% to $7.9 billion, driven mainly by higher 787 deliveries.
The segment reported an operating loss of $678 million, widening from a $622 million loss in the same period in 
2022, with a margin of 8.6%.

Boeing to eliminate leftover inventory by 2025

Boeing's chief executive officer said the US manufacturer will continue reducing leftover Boeing 787 and 737 Max 
inventory to "eliminate those shadow factories and focus our resources on the production floor".
"We still plan to deliver most, if not all, of the inventory by the end of next year, which will set us on a strong path for 
2025 and 2026," Dave Calhoun said on an earnings call, adding: "Our shadow factories will be shut down."
The company said it will exit 2023 with just over 100 of the return-to-service aircraft that it had at the end of 2020. 
"That is what our shadow factories are focused on in a big way to make sure that we can bleed that down to nothing 
by the end of next year."
"We still expect most of the Max inventory aircraft to be delivered by the end of 2024, but more are likely to slip into 
2025 tied to the fuselage recovery," Calhoun said.
Boeing said it has reduced its 2023 delivery target to 400 at the upper end of guidance, versus 450 previously, due 
to recently announced supplier non-conformance for certain 737 Max aircraft during the third quarter of 2023. Only 
70 737 Max aircraft were delivered during the third quarter, also highlighting the impact of this issue.
"Non-conformance costs are exponentially higher on all of those finished airplanes," Calhoun said. Conversely, he 
noted that correcting non-conformances gets "exponentially easier" when this inventory has been delivered to 
customers.
"And even in these last just several months with the non-conformance issues that have constrained our delivery, as 
we've said many times, we have kept our master schedule intact to get to that 38. We're building inventory in the 
process, and we're paying our suppliers. So, they're not second guessing where we will end up.
"We are keeping our suppliers hot according to the master schedule. We plan to complete the production transition 
to 38 per month by the end of the year and still plan to reach the key rate of 50 per month by that 2025- and 2026-
timeframe," Calhoun concluded.
During the third quarter, Boeing booked 398 net orders on the commercial side, including 150 737 Max 10s for 
Ryanair, 50 787s for United Airlines, and 39 787s for Saudi Arabian Airlines.

The travel industry has reaped the rewards of a frantic summer season, with airlines reporting record profits and 
hotels on both sides of the Atlantic having returned to near pre-pandemic occupancy.
But it is facing an uncertain winter and questions over whether the insatiable demand for holidays can withstand 
persistently high inflation and economic stagnation, or is a post-pandemic bubble waiting to burst.
Most senior executives, particularly in Europe, are confident that consumer spending on travel appears immune to 
the cost of living crisis.
But some cracks are appearing to show across the Atlantic, where the first signs of weakening demand have 
appeared in the domestic market.
Low-cost airline Spirit said it had turned to "steep discounting" as it issued a profit warning this month, while JetBlue 
reported a "shift away" from domestic travel in August.
More optimistic executives say travellers are swapping domestic breaks for foreign holidays, and an influx of US 
tourists certainly boosted Europe's tourist industry this summer.
Travel industry faces reality check as the summer boom starts to fade Many European executives remain 
upbeat but cracks are showing in US market as downturn bit....
But as domestic trips in the US were one of the first parts of the travel industry to restart during the pandemic, there 
are also fears that this slowdown could be an early warning that broader desire for travel is wilting.
In Europe, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the continent's largest airline Ryanair, remains "cautious" despite 
strong winter bookings that are 3-4 per cent ahead of where they were last year.
"I am worried about the state of consumer confidence ... you have higher interest rates, higher mortgage payments 
and energy prices," he said.
O'Leary expects to have to cut prices to fill planes during quieter periods as the industry becomes more "peaky" 
and for overall fares to fall by "low single digits" this winter.
Sébastien Bazin, chief executive of hotel giant Accor, agrees that the industry is braced for a "diminishing in pricing 
power". The French company has offset occupancy levels that are 4 per cent lower than before the pandemic by 
raising prices 10 per cent.
"With interest rates the way they are and what we've seen with inflation the way it is, the discretionary income of 
consumers is going to be far less, but we've planned for that," said Bazin.
Accor now expected more normal growth in revenues per available room of 2.5-5 per cent a year, he added, 
"because of pressure on the middle class population".
For most though, serious cracks are yet to appear. As of mid-September, booked occupancy for hotels worldwide in 
the fourth quarter was 11 per cent ahead of the same time last year, according to travel technology platform 
Amadeus. Revenue per available room, a key industry metric, for the year to the end of August stands at $116, just 
under the 2019 average of $117 but well ahead of $99 for 2022.
Dana Dunne, chief executive of eDreams ODIGEO, one of Europe's largest online travel agents, believes talk of a 
post-pandemic travel "bubble" that could burst is misplaced. He said the industry had returned to "normal travel 
patterns", with the to and fro of seasonality and quieter winters returning, but no sign of a collapse in demand. "It 
looks absolutely fine," he said.
The return of Chinese tourists to overseas destinations should also provide an uplift for the travel sector. Before the 
pandemic there were 170mn outbound Chinese tourists but by the end of this year there will only be about 70mn 
border crossings from mainland China, according to projections by the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute.
"The Chinese can't get out of China right now because there's no flight capacity ... so the international market hasn't 
healed there yet," said Bill Heinecke, chief of Thai-headquartered hotel group Minor International. "This will begin to 
improve by the end of the year."
The future of leisure travel is particularly important because of lingering questions over corporate travel, which has 
been slower to recover.
Airline Virgin Atlantic is expecting a "strong" final quarter of the year, with passenger numbers up 14 per cent year 
on year as it focuses on "winter sun" destinations with the launch of new routes to Dubai, the Maldives and the 
Turks & Caicos islands.
London-listed tour operator On The Beach Group reported winter bookings 26 per cent ahead of 2022-23 in a 
reassuring investor update this year, while passenger bookings at P&O Ferries going into the winter are also up 
more than 30 per cent on last year.
For airlines, the questions over winter demand have come as fuel costs have risen sharply, meaning strong 
demand for travel is key to being able to pass on the costs to consumers through higher ticket prices.
Travel industry faces reality check as the summer boom starts to fade Many European executives remain 
upbeat but cracks are showing in US market as downturn bit....
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, said the industry was still enjoying "excess demand" post-pandemic, but once 
this cools "economic factors" would again drive companies' fortunes.
Stocks in the sector have taken a recent battering, with MSCI's Global Airlines Index down a fifth since mid- July 
and 40 per cent below its pre-pandemic levels.
The industry is typically seen as cyclical and exposed to the global economy and investors have never bought into 
the recovery story, with share prices of most major carriers still below their prepandemic levels.
"Airline shares are not in vogue," analysts at Barclays said in a recent note.
Yet Dunne believes investors are wrong to tie the industry's fortunes to the global economy. "I completely disagree 
with the thesis, historically it is dead wrong," he said.
"A year ago some investors would have been telling you 'oh it's really bad, people won't travel'," he added. "And 
that just wasn't the case."

The travel industry has reaped the rewards of a frantic summer season, with airlines reporting record profits and 
hotels on both sides of the Atlantic having returned to near pre-pandemic occupancy.
But it is facing an uncertain winter and questions over whether the insatiable demand for holidays can withstand 
persistently high inflation and economic stagnation, or is a post-pandemic bubble waiting to burst.
Most senior executives, particularly in Europe, are confident that consumer spending on travel appears immune to 
the cost of living crisis.
But some cracks are appearing to show across the Atlantic, where the first signs of weakening demand have 
appeared in the domestic market.
Low-cost airline Spirit said it had turned to "steep discounting" as it issued a profit warning this month, while JetBlue 
reported a "shift away" from domestic travel in August.
More optimistic executives say travellers are swapping domestic breaks for foreign holidays, and an influx of US 
tourists certainly boosted Europe's tourist industry this summer.
Travel industry faces reality check as the summer boom starts to fade Many European executives remain 
upbeat but cracks are showing in US market as downturn bit....
But as domestic trips in the US were one of the first parts of the travel industry to restart during the pandemic, there 
are also fears that this slowdown could be an early warning that broader desire for travel is wilting.
In Europe, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the continent's largest airline Ryanair, remains "cautious" despite 
strong winter bookings that are 3-4 per cent ahead of where they were last year.
"I am worried about the state of consumer confidence ... you have higher interest rates, higher mortgage payments 
and energy prices," he said.
O'Leary expects to have to cut prices to fill planes during quieter periods as the industry becomes more "peaky" 
and for overall fares to fall by "low single digits" this winter.
Sébastien Bazin, chief executive of hotel giant Accor, agrees that the industry is braced for a "diminishing in pricing 
power". The French company has offset occupancy levels that are 4 per cent lower than before the pandemic by 
raising prices 10 per cent.
"With interest rates the way they are and what we've seen with inflation the way it is, the discretionary income of 
consumers is going to be far less, but we've planned for that," said Bazin.
Accor now expected more normal growth in revenues per available room of 2.5-5 per cent a year, he added, 
"because of pressure on the middle class population".
For most though, serious cracks are yet to appear. As of mid-September, booked occupancy for hotels worldwide in 
the fourth quarter was 11 per cent ahead of the same time last year, according to travel technology platform 
Amadeus. Revenue per available room, a key industry metric, for the year to the end of August stands at $116, just 
under the 2019 average of $117 but well ahead of $99 for 2022.
Dana Dunne, chief executive of eDreams ODIGEO, one of Europe's largest online travel agents, believes talk of a 
post-pandemic travel "bubble" that could burst is misplaced. He said the industry had returned to "normal travel 
patterns", with the to and fro of seasonality and quieter winters returning, but no sign of a collapse in demand. "It 
looks absolutely fine," he said.
The return of Chinese tourists to overseas destinations should also provide an uplift for the travel sector. Before the 
pandemic there were 170mn outbound Chinese tourists but by the end of this year there will only be about 70mn 
border crossings from mainland China, according to projections by the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute.
"The Chinese can't get out of China right now because there's no flight capacity ... so the international market hasn't 
healed there yet," said Bill Heinecke, chief of Thai-headquartered hotel group Minor International. "This will begin to 
improve by the end of the year."
The future of leisure travel is particularly important because of lingering questions over corporate travel, which has 
been slower to recover.
Airline Virgin Atlantic is expecting a "strong" final quarter of the year, with passenger numbers up 14 per cent year 
on year as it focuses on "winter sun" destinations with the launch of new routes to Dubai, the Maldives and the 
Turks & Caicos islands.
London-listed tour operator On The Beach Group reported winter bookings 26 per cent ahead of 2022-23 in a 
reassuring investor update this year, while passenger bookings at P&O Ferries going into the winter are also up 
more than 30 per cent on last year.
For airlines, the questions over winter demand have come as fuel costs have risen sharply, meaning strong 
demand for travel is key to being able to pass on the costs to consumers through higher ticket prices.
Travel industry faces reality check as the summer boom starts to fade Many European executives remain 
upbeat but cracks are showing in US market as downturn bit....
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, said the industry was still enjoying "excess demand" post-pandemic, but once 
this cools "economic factors" would again drive companies' fortunes.
Stocks in the sector have taken a recent battering, with MSCI's Global Airlines Index down a fifth since mid- July 
and 40 per cent below its pre-pandemic levels.
The industry is typically seen as cyclical and exposed to the global economy and investors have never bought into 
the recovery story, with share prices of most major carriers still below their prepandemic levels.
"Airline shares are not in vogue," analysts at Barclays said in a recent note.
Yet Dunne believes investors are wrong to tie the industry's fortunes to the global economy. "I completely disagree 
with the thesis, historically it is dead wrong," he said.
"A year ago some investors would have been telling you 'oh it's really bad, people won't travel'," he added. "And 
that just wasn't the case."

Portugal 's sale of national carrier TAP opens way for bidding war Airlines

Portugal's national carrier TAP has been put up for sale by the government in a move that opens the way for more 
airline consolidation and a potential bidding war involving British Airways owner IAG and Air France-KLM.
Fernando Medina, Portugal's finance minister, said yesterday that the cabinet had approved the privatisation of the 
airline - which is wholly owned by the government - and that at least 51 per cent of its shares would be sold.
TAP, which is estimated to be worth about (EURO)1bn and swung back into profit last year, is emerging from years 
of trouble that have included near bankruptcy, a government bailout and scandals.
Its sale would represent a new stage of consolidation in Europe's airline industry, which has been accelerated by 
the pandemic. The region's three main airline groups, IAG, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, have each said they are 
looking for acquisitions and expressed interest in TAP, which would open up the increasingly lucrative South 
American market.
"We see the takeover of TAP as being part of the ongoing consolidation that [is] playing out in Europe with the end 
game likely being three large network carriers and Ryanair," said Mark Simpson, aviation analyst at Goodbody.
Luis Gallego, IAG's chief executive said: "We'll have to study the process [of privatisation] and carefully consider 
the details, but we feel optimistic and believe that TAP can become another success story within IAG."

IAG this year agreed a deal to buy Spain's Air Europa, while Lufthansa bought Italy's ITA, the successor to the 
defunct Alitalia.
On TAP, Medina said: "There are interested airlines and their interest is public, which we welcome as a positive 
sign for the success of this operation." He also noted TAP's "privileged connections" to the Portuguese-speaking 
countries Brazil, Angola and Mozambique.
TAP ended a protracted run of losses and returned to the black in 2022 with a profit of (EURO)66mn.
The Portuguese government left open the option of selling 100 per cent of its TAP shares, but also said up to 5 per 
cent would be reserved for employees of the company. It said it was looking for "an investor of scale" from the 
airline sector that would ensure the company's growth, the development of Lisbon as a hub, and make the most of 
underutilised airports, notably Porto.
TAP was last privatised in 2015 but the collapse of air travel during the pandemic brought it to the brink of failure.
The government chose to save it in June 2020 via a nationalisation plan approved by the European Commission. 
The rescue aid totalled (EURO)3.2bn of loans and loan guarantees and led to a forced restructuring.
Along with the main TAP airline, the sale will include Portugália, a small business that does short-haul flights, as 
well as a catering company and a health services group.

Sep 29, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and 
were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose 
securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. 
With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better 
chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what 
value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, 
Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, 
and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into 
account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of 
upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly 
Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Top Growth Stock for the Long-Term
percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine 
favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks. 
VGM Score 
What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it 
one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined 
weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and 
most promising momentum. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier. 
#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more 
than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of 
stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, 
on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to 
pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 
(Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RYAAY has a Growth Style Score of A, 
forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 23.3% for the current fiscal year. 
For fiscal 2024, one analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.26 to $8.99 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has announced further cuts to its winter schedule due to delayed deliveries of 
several new aircraft from The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).
Just 14 of an expected 27 aircraft will arrive over the coming months, Ryanair said in a statement, as manufacturer 
Boeing and its own supplier Spirit AreoSystems face production delays.
"It is deeply regrettable that production problems in Wichita, and in Seattle, have yet again delayed Boeing's 
contracted deliveries to Ryanair this winter," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said.
Flights will be cancelled from October, he added, while Ryanair continues "working closely" with Boeing to secure 
delivery of all 57 737 jets by late May.
Fewer aircraft will be based at Charleroi, Dublin, Bergamo, Naples, Pisa, Porto, Cologne and East Midlands Airport 
to make up for the shortfall.
Though the full extent of the cancellations remains unclear, O'Leary added customers would be told over the 
coming days.
Boeing has repeatedly warned of delays to deliveries of its aircraft this year, with a parts issue at Spirit having 
already affected production.
Ryanair reassured it was still on course to reach its traffic target of 183.5 million passengers meanwhile, but warned 
any further delays from Boeing could weigh in.

Ryanair shares fell by 2.6% to (EURO)15.52.

Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, has been compelled to make cuts to its winter schedule 
due to 737 Max delivery delays from Boeing. Although the airline remains confident in its full-year traffic forecast for 
now, it acknowledges the potential impact if the delays persist.
Ryanair, a significant Boeing customer, originally anticipated the delivery of 27 aircraft between September and 
December. However, production setbacks at Boeing's Spirit Fuselage facility in Wichita, Kansas, coupled with 
delays in repair and delivery at Boeing's Seattle facility, have forced the airline to revise its expectations, with only 
14 aircraft expected between October and December.
Flight cancellations will commence at the end of October, with affected passengers to be notified by email. 
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, stated that, at this stage, they don't foresee the delays significantly affecting their 
full-year traffic target of 183.5 million passengers. Still, if the delays extend into January-March 2024, adjustments 
may be necessary.
Ryanair shares experienced a 2.8% drop following the announcement.
Boeing expressed its commitment to supporting Ryanair and its partnership, although it didn't confirm specific 
delivery dates.
This isn't the first time Ryanair has faced Boeing-related delays; the airline previously reduced its full-year 
passenger forecast due to potential Boeing delays and air traffic control strikes.
Ryanair had recently reconciled with Boeing, signing a multibillion-dollar deal for up to 300 Boeing jets. Despite 
initial improvements in deliveries, Boeing encountered a production flaw last month, impacting the delivery of its 
popular 737 MAX aircraft.
The schedule adjustments will affect airports in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the UK, Portugal, and Germany. Ryanair is 
actively working to accelerate deliveries in the early months of 2024 to ensure readiness for the summer 2024 peak 
travel season.

Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, has been compelled to make cuts to its winter schedule 
due to 737 Max delivery delays from Boeing. Although the airline remains confident in its full-year traffic forecast for 
now, it acknowledges the potential impact if the delays persist.
Ryanair, a significant Boeing customer, originally anticipated the delivery of 27 aircraft between September and 
December. However, production setbacks at Boeing's Spirit Fuselage facility in Wichita, Kansas, coupled with 
delays in repair and delivery at Boeing's Seattle facility, have forced the airline to revise its expectations, with only 
14 aircraft expected between October and December.
Flight cancellations will commence at the end of October, with affected passengers to be notified by email. 
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, stated that, at this stage, they don't foresee the delays significantly affecting their 
full-year traffic target of 183.5 million passengers. Still, if the delays extend into January-March 2024, adjustments 
may be necessary.
Ryanair shares experienced a 2.8% drop following the announcement.
Boeing expressed its commitment to supporting Ryanair and its partnership, although it didn't confirm specific 
delivery dates.
This isn't the first time Ryanair has faced Boeing-related delays; the airline previously reduced its full-year 
passenger forecast due to potential Boeing delays and air traffic control strikes.
Ryanair had recently reconciled with Boeing, signing a multibillion-dollar deal for up to 300 Boeing jets. Despite 
initial improvements in deliveries, Boeing encountered a production flaw last month, impacting the delivery of its 
popular 737 MAX aircraft.
The schedule adjustments will affect airports in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the UK, Portugal, and Germany. Ryanair is 
actively working to accelerate deliveries in the early months of 2024 to ensure readiness for the summer 2024 peak 
travel season.

Ryanair has announced the discontinuation of 17 routes and the relocation of 19 aircraft from Dublin Airport, citing 
disagreements over rising passenger fees and a lack of environmental incentives. The Dublin Airport Authority 
(DAA) refuted Ryanair's claim of a proposed 45% increase in charges for 2024, stating that the Irish Aviation 
Authority had sanctioned only a 6% rise. DAA CEO Kenny Jacobs criticized Ryanair's allegations of 
mismanagement and failure to implement an environmental incentive scheme, emphasizing the importance of 
safety projects and asserting that sustainability measures were forthcoming.
Routes affected by Ryanair's decision include destinations such as Carcassonne, Nuremberg, Leipzig/Halle, 
Billund, Bournemouth, Castellón, Asturias, Santiago de Compostela, Genoa, Palermo, Klagenfurt, Kosice, Plovdiv, 
Palanga, Sibiu, Suceava, and Szczecin Goleniów. The dispute highlights ongoing challenges between airlines and 
airports regarding fees and environmental considerations.

Airline Ancillary Revenue Surpasses Pre-COVID Levels, Increasing Over 50% in 2022
Airline Ancillary Revenue Surpasses Pre-COVID Levels, Increasing Over 
50% in 2022

Airline ancillary revenue, generated from add-ons and loyalty programs, has seen a significant increase, surging 
over 50% in 2022 compared to the previous year and surpassing pre-COVID levels. According to the CarTrawler 
Yearbook of Ancillary Revenue in partnership with IdeaWorks Company, airlines collected nearly $69 billion from 
ancillary revenue in 2022, up from $45 billion in 2021. This increase also marked an additional $10 billion compared 
to 2019 levels.
Several factors were cited as possible reasons for this surge in ancillary revenue. One contributing factor may be 
travelers' desire for more personal space, leading to increased purchases of ancillaries such as priority boarding 
and car rentals.
Low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, Southwest, and Spirit, experienced significant gains in ancillary revenue, with 
increases of 40% or more. EasyJet saw an impressive hike of 273%, driven by the introduction of new products and 
services, such as its Standard Plus leisure fare in 2021, as well as increased inflight retail conversion and profit.
Full-service carriers like Delta, United, and American Airlines led the ancillary revenue growth, with gains of 37%, 
44%, and 31%, respectively. These carriers benefited from their loyalty programs and co-branded credit card 
programs.
The report also highlighted the substantial contribution of loyalty programs, revealing that the five largest U.S. 
airlines generated nearly $23 billion from their loyalty programs in 2022, with an average of $33 per passenger, up 
from approximately $26 per passenger in 2019.
Peter O'Donovan, CEO of CarTrawler, emphasized the importance of diversified revenue streams for airlines in the 
post-COVID travel era. He expects ancillary revenue as a percentage of overall revenue to continue increasing over 
the next few years, with a particular focus on loyalty programs as a key trend to watch in the airline industry.
This data showcases how airlines are exploring new revenue streams beyond ticket sales to strengthen their 
business models and adapt to changing passenger preferences.

Airline ancillary revenue, generated from add-ons and loyalty programs, has seen a significant increase, surging 
over 50% in 2022 compared to the previous year and surpassing pre-COVID levels. According to the CarTrawler 
Yearbook of Ancillary Revenue in partnership with IdeaWorks Company, airlines collected nearly $69 billion from 
ancillary revenue in 2022, up from $45 billion in 2021. This increase also marked an additional $10 billion compared 
to 2019 levels.
Several factors were cited as possible reasons for this surge in ancillary revenue. One contributing factor may be 
travelers' desire for more personal space, leading to increased purchases of ancillaries such as priority boarding 
and car rentals.
Low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, Southwest, and Spirit, experienced significant gains in ancillary revenue, with 
increases of 40% or more. EasyJet saw an impressive hike of 273%, driven by the introduction of new products and 
services, such as its Standard Plus leisure fare in 2021, as well as increased inflight retail conversion and profit.
Full-service carriers like Delta, United, and American Airlines led the ancillary revenue growth, with gains of 37%, 
44%, and 31%, respectively. These carriers benefited from their loyalty programs and co-branded credit card 
programs.
The report also highlighted the substantial contribution of loyalty programs, revealing that the five largest U.S. 
airlines generated nearly $23 billion from their loyalty programs in 2022, with an average of $33 per passenger, up 
from approximately $26 per passenger in 2019.
Peter O'Donovan, CEO of CarTrawler, emphasized the importance of diversified revenue streams for airlines in the 
post-COVID travel era. He expects ancillary revenue as a percentage of overall revenue to continue increasing over 
the next few years, with a particular focus on loyalty programs as a key trend to watch in the airline industry.
This data showcases how airlines are exploring new revenue streams beyond ticket sales to strengthen their 
business models and adapt to changing passenger preferences.

Airline ancillary revenue, generated from add-ons and loyalty programs, has seen a significant increase, surging 
over 50% in 2022 compared to the previous year and surpassing pre-COVID levels. According to the CarTrawler 
Yearbook of Ancillary Revenue in partnership with IdeaWorks Company, airlines collected nearly $69 billion from 
ancillary revenue in 2022, up from $45 billion in 2021. This increase also marked an additional $10 billion compared 
to 2019 levels.
Several factors were cited as possible reasons for this surge in ancillary revenue. One contributing factor may be 
travelers' desire for more personal space, leading to increased purchases of ancillaries such as priority boarding 
and car rentals.
Low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, Southwest, and Spirit, experienced significant gains in ancillary revenue, with 
increases of 40% or more. EasyJet saw an impressive hike of 273%, driven by the introduction of new products and 
services, such as its Standard Plus leisure fare in 2021, as well as increased inflight retail conversion and profit.
Full-service carriers like Delta, United, and American Airlines led the ancillary revenue growth, with gains of 37%, 
44%, and 31%, respectively. These carriers benefited from their loyalty programs and co-branded credit card 
programs.
The report also highlighted the substantial contribution of loyalty programs, revealing that the five largest U.S. 
airlines generated nearly $23 billion from their loyalty programs in 2022, with an average of $33 per passenger, up 
from approximately $26 per passenger in 2019.
Peter O'Donovan, CEO of CarTrawler, emphasized the importance of diversified revenue streams for airlines in the 
post-COVID travel era. He expects ancillary revenue as a percentage of overall revenue to continue increasing over 
the next few years, with a particular focus on loyalty programs as a key trend to watch in the airline industry.
This data showcases how airlines are exploring new revenue streams beyond ticket sales to strengthen their 
business models and adapt to changing passenger preferences.

Budget airline Ryanair is reducing its autumn and winter schedule due to problems in the delivery of Boeing aircraft.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said, "At this early date, we do not expect these delivery delays will materially affect 
our full year traffic target of 183.5m, but if the delays worsen or extend further into the Jan to Mar 2024 period, we 
may have to revisit this figure and possibly adjust it slightly downward."
Ryanair now expects to receive only 14 aircraft between October and December, while earlier it was expecting 
deliveries of 27 aircraft between September and December.
According to the company, the expected reduction in deliveries was due to production delays at the Spirit Fuselage 
facility in Wichita, combined with Boeings repair and delivery delays in Seattle.
Ryanair will make a number of adjustments to its winter 2023 schedule this week. The company is reducing the 
number of Charleroi based aircraft by three, Dublin based aircraft by two, and will reduce five aircraft across four 
Italian bases, including Bergamo, Naples and Pisa.
There will also be aircraft reductions in East Midlands, Porto, and Cologne. These flight cancellations will take effect 
from the end of October.
Passengers will be offered seats on alternative flights or full refunds as they so wish. Ryanair said it is working with 
Boeing to try to get delivery of all 57 contracted B737 aircraft before the end of May 2024.
The company hopes to enter the summer 2024 peak travel season with all 57 new Boeing aircraft deliveries as 
expected.
The company noted that it has no spare aircraft this winter as scheduled maintenance is necessary across full fleet 
of over 550 aircraft to prepare for summer 2024 schedule.
Delivery troubles mean Ryanair cutting autumn and winter schedule

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC announced it has cut its winter flight schedule due to delays in the delivery 
of new Boeing Co 737 planes.
It will reduce the number of aircraft it planned to base at several airports across Europe, including East Midlands 
Airport and Dublin Airport.
The airline said it was due to receive 27 new Boeing aircraft between September and December, but expects the 
figure to be just 14.
This has been attributed to production delays at the Spirit fuselage factory in Wichita, Kansas, combined with 
Boeing hold-ups in repairs and deliveries in Seattle, Washington.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "We are working closely with Boeing and their supplier, Spirit, to 
minimise these delivery delays.
"It is deeply regrettable that production problems in Wichita and in Seattle have yet again delayed Boeing's 
contracted deliveries to Ryanair this winter.
"We are in regular dialogue with Boeing, and our primary objective is to ensure we get delivery of all 57 contracted 
B737 aircraft before the end of May 2024, so that Ryanair's fleet can grow to over 600 aircraft for what will be our 
largest ever summer flight programme.
"These flight cancellations will take effect from the end of October, and will be communicated to all affected 
passengers by email over the coming days.
"Passengers will be offered re-accommodation on alternative flights or full refunds as they so wish.
"We apologise sincerely to passengers for any inconvenience caused by these delivery delays this winter.
Ryanair cuts flights due to delivery delays of Boeing 737 planes
"At this early date, we do not expect these delivery delays will materially affect our full-year traffic target of 183.5 
million, but if the delays worsen or extend further into the January to March 2024 period, we may have to revisit this 
figure and possibly adjust it slightly downward."
Ryanair shares traded 1.1% higher at EUR15.72 each on Thursday morning in Frankfurt.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is facing a delay in the delivery of Boeing's (BOEI.BR) 737 Max aircraft due to quality lapses by 
aerostructures manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems (S9Q.F), which builds the jet's frame, Bloomberg News reported 
Wednesday.
Speaking in an interview on Wednesday, Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary confirmed that Boeing 
will only be able to provide 14 of the 27 jets that were originally scheduled for delivery by late December 2023, with 
the remaining 43 aircraft to be delivered by April 2024. The low-budget carrier ordered 150 737 Max jets earlier this 
year, with an additional 150 options. 
O'Leary also called Boeing out for its continued quality control and production problems, which are expected to 
impact Ryanair's plans to leverage the post-COVID-19 travel boom, the report said.
Shares in Ryanair and Spirit AeroSystems were each up more than 1% in Ireland and Germany, respectively.

 It's game on for another round of airline consolidation in Europe. The PortugueseCouncil of Ministers[1] has 
approved the plan to privatize TAP Air Portugal[2] and sell 51 percent. At least five percent will be reserved for the 
airline's employees, the government announced on Thursday. The state currently is the sole shareholder. 
During a press conference, Minister of Finance Fernando Medina said that the privatization has five targets. The 
first is to ensure that TAP Air Portugal can continue to grow under a new minority owner. The second is that Lisbon 
can be developed and grow as the main hub beyond the 53 percent market share it has there now. TAP should also 
grow end-to-end operations and operate to what Media referred to as untapped capacity at domestic airports. The 
priority is Porto, where low-cost carriers like easyJet and Ryanair have gained market share.

 Delivery delays of the Boeing MAX 8200 forceRyanair[1] to make adjustments in its original winter 2023/2024 
schedule. The low-cost carrier said on Thursday that it is expecting thirteen fewer aircraft deliveries until the end of 
December.  
Ryanair had expected 27 MAX 8200s between September and the end of December but is now anticipating only 
fourteen between October and December. The carrier cites production delays at Boeing's supplierSpirit 
AeroSystems[2] as one of the reasons. Spirit is down on its production target after employees went on strike in July 
and are unable to recover from this.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) is reportedly evaluating the possibility of relocating its primary stock exchange 
listing from Dublin to Brussels, citing concerns over high stamp duty on share trading in Ireland and governance 
rules aligned closely with the London Stock Exchange (LSE). According to CEO Michael O'Leary, the move is 
driven by a desire for more straightforward regulations on European exchanges, highlighting Brussels as a potential 
alternative to Dublin. If realized, the shift would follow the airline's delisting from the LSE in December 2021. 
O'Leary's comments come in the wake of Ryanair's decision to cut routes from Dublin International amid disputes 
over passenger charges and environmental incentives with airport operator DAA. The potential relocation could 
impact the Irish bourse. Ryanair has not yet commented on the reports.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) is reportedly evaluating the possibility of relocating its primary stock exchange 
listing from Dublin to Brussels, citing concerns over high stamp duty on share trading in Ireland and governance 
rules aligned closely with the London Stock Exchange (LSE). According to CEO Michael O'Leary, the move is 
driven by a desire for more straightforward regulations on European exchanges, highlighting Brussels as a potential 
alternative to Dublin. If realized, the shift would follow the airline's delisting from the LSE in December 2021. 
O'Leary's comments come in the wake of Ryanair's decision to cut routes from Dublin International amid disputes 
over passenger charges and environmental incentives with airport operator DAA. The potential relocation could 
impact the Irish bourse. Ryanair has not yet commented on the reports.

Reduced air traffic flow at Gatwick Airport has prompted renewed calls on the government to grant regulator the 
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) more powers over the industry.
Having been forced to reduce the number of flights due to a bout of staff illness, National Air Traffic Services 
(NATS) has been blamed for causing UK cancellations once again.
Airlines and consumer groups alike have called for the air traffic controller to be held to account as a result, given 
some 165 flights to and from the airport this week could be affected.
"Consumers are paying record amounts of money for flights they can no longer trust will go ahead," consumer 
group Which? said. 
"To help end this cycle of miserable passenger experiences, the prime minister must play his part and prioritise 
legislation to give the CAA stronger enforcement powers."
easyJet PLC, which looks set to be the worst affected airline, repeated calls for an investigation to be opened into 
NATS.
Though Covid-19 was mentioned among the reasons that have seen a third of NATS' Gatwick staff currently off 
work, easyJet urged more be done to mitigate future disruption. 
Rival budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) went as far as calling for the resignation of NATS chief 
executive Martin Rolfe.
Gatwick air traffic reductions prompt calls for greater regulation
Just three flights were cancelled at Gatwick on Tuesday, according to tracking website FlightAware, though more 
disruption looks set for later this week as departures and arrivals are capped at 800 until Sunday.

Sep 27, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common 
goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. 
The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and 
so on. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what 
value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, 
Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, 
and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into 
account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings 
outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint 
Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Value Stock
good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage 
change in earnings estimates. 
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or 
changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are 
right for you and your investing journey. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also 
have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
It also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 10.74; value

Ryanair calls for NATS boss to resign over Gatwick cancellations
Ryanair calls for NATS boss to resign over Gatwick cancellations

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has called for the resignation of National Air Traffic Services (NATS) boss 
Martin Rolfe over disruption at Gatwick Airport, expected this week.
Following news that Gatwick Airport had been forced to reduce the number of flights it can handle over the coming 
days as air traffic controllers are hit by a bout of illness, including Covid-19, Ryanair called on regulators to 
intervene.
"NATS has been a shambles for years," the Irish airline said through a spokesperson. 
"It is unacceptable that airlines have been asked to cancel flights to [and] from Gatwick Airport for the next six days 
as a result of NATS's failure to adequately staff UK air traffic control."
Nearly 170 flights could be affected after the airport placed a daily limit on the number of arrivals and departures 
until Sunday, 1 October.
No more than 800 flights will pass through the single-runway airport each day before then, meaning a peak of 65 
scheduled journeys will have to be cancelled or relocated on Friday.
"Given the levels of sickness we have experienced over the last few weeks we believe it is the responsible thing to 
do to limit the number of flights this week in order to reduce the risk of daily disruption to passengers using the 
airport," air traffic controller NATS said.
Ryanair calls for NATS boss to resign over Gatwick cancellations
Around a third of those who work in Gatwick's air traffic control tower are currently off sick, NATS explained, 
including with Covid-19.
easyJet PLC looks set to be the worst affected airline, with chief executive John Lundgren backing reduced 
operations but urging NATS and Gatwick to work to prevent future issues.
"Our call for a more wide-ranging review of NATS remains so the broader issues can be examined," he said.
A fault that caused NATS' system to shut down in August had been responsible for a week of travel chaos that saw 
thousands of flights cancelled and some 300,000 passengers hit.

Highlight: The London airport could see over 150 flights cancelled this week after its air traffic control staff have 
been hit by medical issues including Covid.
Body
Further air traffic control (ATC) issues have hit the UK after one of its major airports, London Gatwick, which is 
putting temporary flight restrictions in place to deal with reduced staffing levels at its control tower due to sickness.  
The decision to limit flights to 800 a day, covering departures and arrivals, was made alongside the UK's national 
air traffic control body NATS which is responsible for the ATC staff, 30% of whom are currently unavailable for 
medical reasons including Covid-19 diagnoses.  Restrictions, which could affect around 164 flights according to 
data for the previously expected number of movements at Gatwick each day this week, will remain in place until 
Sunday 1 October.  Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate apologised to affected passengers, he said: "This has been a 
difficult decision but the action we have taken today means our airlines can fly reliable flight programmes, which 
gives passengers more certainty that they will not face last minute cancellations.   "We are working closely with 
NATS to build resilience in the control tower, and this decision means we can prevent as much disruptions as 
possible."  News of the limits comes less than a month after a system outage, caused by an issue with a flight plan 
processing sub-system, lead NATS to introduce temporary traffic restrictions across the entire UK airspace.  
Gatwick will reportedly share the cancellations equally between airlines, but budget airline Ryanair has claimed it 
will not be cancelling any flights to and from the airport.  The airline, which has also been very critical of NATS' 
response to the summer system outage, called on NATS CEO Martin Rolfe to fix the staff shortage issue or resign 
from his position and described the organisation as "a shambles."  A spokesperson for Ryanair said it was 
unacceptable to ask airlines to cancel flights, they said: "It is clear that NATS CEO, Martin Rolfe has taken no 
action to resolve these ATC staff shortages and should now do the right thing and step down as NATS CEO so that 
someone competent can do the job.  "We call on the CAA to immediately intervene and protect passengers from 
this ongoing UK ATC shambles." 
NATS itself said that the decision had been made after looking at levels of sickness across recent weeks and it 
would continue to rain additional ATC controllers going forward, with another group set to qualify to work at the 
Gatwick tower in the coming months. A statement said: "Even an experienced air traffic controller takes at least 9 
Flights restricted for week at Gatwick due to air traffic control issues
months to qualify at Gatwick and very few are able to do so, as Gatwick is such a busy and complex air traffic 
environment. "We will continue to recruit and train air traffic controllers at Gatwick a fast as possible to ensure we 
return to a fully resilient operation as soon as we can."

Ryanair considers relisting after spat with Dublin Airport
Ryanair considers relisting after spat with Dublin Airport

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) is reportedly considering moving its primary listing from Dublin to Brussels as a 
spat with Ireland's key airport rumbles on.
Having said last week that it would scrap 17 routes from Dublin this winter, the Irish carrier could now be 
considering ditching the city's stock exchange too in search of more favourable terms elsewhere, The Times 
reported.
"There is no reason why we should be in Dublin, rather than Brussels," chief executive Michael O'Leary told the 
newspaper.
Though Dublin is included in the pan-European stock market group, Euronext, O'Learly claimed Britain's exit from 
the EU had affected the governance of Ireland's exchange.
High stamp duty could also be affecting international investors' choice to invest in Ireland, he added, with simpler 
regulation needed.
Speculation that Ryanair could ditch its Irish listing comes after the airline accused Dublin Airport of wasting money 
and hiking passenger fees out of kilter with other European airlines.
Some 19 of the airline's new Boeing 737 Max jets were relocated as a result, with Ryanair suggesting better 
sustainability incentives and lower passenger fees could be found elsewhere.
Ryanair considers relisting after spat with Dublin Airport
The move would mark Ryanair's second relisting in recent years, after the company left the London Stock 
Exchange in 2021 over concerns that Brexit had hit trading volumes.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is looking to relocate its listing to Brussels from Dublin, Ireland, amid frustration over listing rules, 
the Sunday Times reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. 
While its Dublin listing is not under immediate threat, O'Leary said the listing rules in Dublin are too similar to those 
of the London stock exchange's, instead of other Euronext NV arenas, according to the Sunday report. 
The ultra-low-cost airline moved its primary listing to Dublin from London in December 2021 following Brexit.
Shares ended 1% lower in trading on Sept. 22.
