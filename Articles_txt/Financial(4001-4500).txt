Boeing customers cancelled 34 aircraft in April, leaving the airframer with 12 net new orders for the month.
The 34 cancellations comprised 32 737 Max units: Malaysia Airlines cancelled 25 Max 8s (to be leased from Air 
Lease (ALC) instead); ALC itself cancelled commitments for five Max units and other US lessor Aviation Capital 
Group (ACG) terminated deals for two Max aircraft.
Leasing giant Aercap exited contracts for two widebody Boeing 787-10 aircraft.
Lessors did, however, also place 46 new orders with the US OEM in April.
They comprise 44 737 Max series orders and two for 777F cargo aircraft.
Aercap committed to taking nine additional 737 Max units, while ACG recommitted to two incremental Max aircraft.
The customer for 28 additional 737 Max units remains undisclosed, as does the taker for the two 777Fs.
In the month to 30 April, Boeing shifted 65 aircraft back to its firm backlog, removing them from the ASC 606 ledger 
used for deals unlikely to be fulfilled.
Boeing is still not delivering 787 aircraft and it has pushed the 777X programme out to 2025, although certain 
customers have complained to AFJ that they fear first deliveries could even take a year longer than that.
Boeing will soon move its headquarters from Chicago to Washington to seek closer proximity and alignment with 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
In April, the US manufacturer delivered 35 aircraft in April, comprising 28 737 Max aircraft, a 737-800 for military 
use, a 747-8F, three 777-300ERs and two 767s for military use.
Lessors accounted for approximately half of Boeing's April deliveries. ALC, ICBC Aviation, DAE Capital and 777 
Partners accepted Max aircraft from their own orderbooks.
Aeromexico, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Flydubai, Gol, Lynx Air, Oman Air, Ryanair, Southwest Airlines and TUI 
received Max units on direct order, although some were sold on delivery to leasing companies.
Lessors cancel Max, 787 orders
BOC Aviation was behind the three 777-300ER deliveries; all three widebodies are now in service with Thai 
Airways.

How stagflation could impact airlines and lessors
How stagflation could impact airlines and lessors

Stagflation would heighten liquidity and refinancing risks for some US airlines, with rising interest rates having the 
potential to add further pressure, Fitch Ratings warns in a recent report.
The rating agency views airlines as having medium to high rating risk under a scenario of sustained high inflation 
and sharply lower economic growth.
This is due to cyclicality, energy dependence, already negative free cash flow and significant upcoming maturities.
The credit effects would vary by issuer.  However, Fitch already has negative rating outlooks for Delta Air Lines 
(BB+), United Airlines, Inc. (B+), Southwest Airlines Co. (BBB+), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (BB-), JetBlue Airways 
Corporation (BB-), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (BB+) and Air Canada (B+). 
Higher rents?
If Fitch's stagflation scenario is correct and increasing liquidity and refinancing risks for some airlines is a growing 
concern, this also raises a question about airlines and aircraft rental fees. 
Will lessors be able to increase lease rates along with higher interest rates?
Aercap's chief executive officer said the improved operating environment is giving airline chiefs confidence on a 
first-quarter earnings call.
"When I speak to airline CEOs, I hear a consistent message: demand is strong enough in the US and Europe to 
pass through higher input costs."
The demand side of the industry continues to improve, with global flight traffic back to 75% of 2019 levels, with 
North America leading the charge at 24,000 daily flights.  Europe also continues to improve, heading into the 
summer with 20,000 daily flights.
He references Ryanair as a "very visible example" of this improving operating environment.
"Ryanair carried one million passengers in April 2021, but in April 2022, it carried 14.2 million passengers or a 14x 
increase."
How stagflation could impact airlines and lessors
Higher interest rates "have to" drive increases in lease rates, says a lessor source, adding: "Old, mid-teen money is 
vacating the space, and new lower cost of funds will be able to capitalise on increasing rates and the rising tide."
Another lessor points to a recent request for proposal (RFP) for a low-cost carrier, saying it "indeed suggests 
upward pressure on rates".
The source notes that the carrier is rumoured to have attracted a 0.6% lease rate factor (LRF) on its latest sale and 
leaseback transaction, "or close to 20% more than had on its previous package".
However, another lessor disagrees, saying lease rates will struggle to keep pace with interest rates.
The source cites an RFP for new Airbus A320neos with a large US carrier.  The sale and leaseback deal is set to 
close at a 0.5% LRF, half-life, the source says.
The lessor also references 20 A320neos destined for Russia, which were recently placed at $280,000 a month with 
another carrier.
Another lessor agrees that lease rates are lagging behind interest rate hikes.  
"We are trying to determine whether this is due to lessors having raised unsecured liquidity that they are unable to 
deploy because new aircraft deliveries are delayed," the lessor says.
The source points to a recent sale and leaseback deal in which the lessor didn't adjust the lease rate despite 
interest rates rising by 1% between the letter of intent and final docs.
"If these already raised funds need to be deployed and are depressing the lease rate market, we will only know 
when everyone has consumed their own liquidity," the source adds. 
Meanwhile, US policymakers are prepared to move ahead with multiple interest rate increases.
The Federal Open Market Committee said at a recent meeting in May policy may have to move past "neutral" and 
into "restrictive" territory.
According to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, policymakers see the need to increase 
benchmark borrowing rates by 50 points.  They expect similar hikes would be necessary at the next several 
meetings.
"Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next 
couple of meetings," the minutes said.
In addition, Federal Open Market Committee members indicated that "a restrictive stance of policy may well 
become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook."

Pilots accuse easyJet of 'bullying' on sick leave Airlines
Pilots accuse easyJet of 'bullying' on sick leave; Airlines

EasyJet's pilots have accused the airline of "corporate bullying" in its handling of staff absences as it struggles with 
a wave of disruption and cancellations. Balpa, the pilots' union, has complained to the company's board about a 
"counterproductive" push to deal with staff calling in sick, which had "completely decimated any residual goodwill 
among your workforce in one fell swoop".
EasyJet has been hit by a wave of staff sickness and been forced to cancel hundreds of flights in recent weeks. The 
disruption has come as the industry has struggled to increase operations after two years of limited flying following a 
surge of spring and summer bookings.
EasyJet's management highlighted the problem from Covid-related absences during an earnings call this month, as 
it disclosed that staff absences have hit 20 per cent in some bases.
But the union anger follows an email sent to pilots and crew last week that warned that the current level of staff 
absence "is not sustainable going forward".
The email admitted that the focus on sickness "may be a tough read", and highlighted company policies towards 
taking "formal action" against staff over absence rates.
"The triggers for formal action are guidelines and we may, if deemed necessary, skip a stage where the absence 
continues to be poor," the email said.
Pilots accuse easyJet of 'bullying' on sick leave Airlines
Staff should not come to work if sick, it said, but bemoaned a "high increase"
in those turning up to work and declaring themselves unfit at the last minute, or not properly rested.
In a letter to the board, Balpa said a wave of Covid-19 infections in the UK had led to higher staff absences.
"An email about higher than normal sickness levels was dispatched universally ... the tone of which our members 
claim, amounts to corporate bullying," the union wrote. "We seek visible and obvious redress."
EasyJet did not make any pilots redundant in the pandemic and Martin Chalk, Balpa's general secretary, said the 
email "flies in the face" of a generally collaborative relationship.
"We urge easyJet to work with us to restore an industry-leading 'win win' relationship," he said.
Chalk blamed the breakdown in relations on Peter Bellew, chief operating officer, with more than 30 years of 
industry experience. EasyJet hired Bellew from Ryanair in 2019, prompting a court challenge in which the Irish 
company failed to halt his move to a rival.
Balpa has clashed with Bellew before.
Two years ago pilots overwhelmingly voted they had no confidence in him, listing grievances including his handling 
of the early stages of the pandemic.
EasyJet said it has "always been very clear" that staff should not come to work if they are sick. "We value the skills 
and professionalism of our pilots and crew ... The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority."

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has neither confirmed nor denied an Italian news report that it is planning to open a new 
base in Trieste.
In an interview with Nordest Economia earlier this month, airport chairman Antonio Marano claimed the Irish budget 
carrier planned to base one aircraft out of the northeastern Italian airfield.
On inquiry, a Ryanair spokesperson said: "We are always interested in opening new bases which are dependent on 
demand, available aircraft capacity, competitive low airport costs and required operational needs being met. We 
continue to actively review all potential future base candidates, but competition for Ryanair capacity remains fierce 
given we are the only major airline growing in Europe."
Ryanair already holds almost 57% market share at Trieste in terms of weekly airline seat capacity, the ch-aviation 
capacities module shows. Its competitors at the airport include ITA - Italia Trasporto Aereo (25% market share), 
Lufthansa (11.6%), and AlbaStar (4.3%).
Ryanair already has bases at Turin, Bologna, Pisa, Pescara, Rome Ciampino, Rome Fiumicino, Naples 
Capodichino, Bari, Brindisi, Lamezia Terme, Catania, and Palermo, according to its website.

Some airlines have dropped a requirement for passengers to wear masks on flights to and from the US after a 
judge threw out a Biden administration mandate.
Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, a Donald Trump appointee who sits on the federal bench in Florida, deemed the 
public transport mask mandate unlawful on Monday.
She ruled that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded its legal authority with the order. The 
CDC had extended the mask rule until May 3.
After the ruling, carriers including American, United, Delta, Southwest and Alaska announced that masks would be 
optional for employees, crew members and customers in US airports and on board.
The change applies to domestic flights and some international ones, depending on the destination, and came 
despite a majority of people in the US supporting a continuation of the mandate.
Videos posted on social media showed some US passengers applauding when crew members told them masks 
were www.optional.UK carriers have followed suit, while French and German airlines are maintaining their 
mandates.

British Airways said it had moved immediately to give passengers personal choice over whether to wear a mask on 
a flight to the US, as did Virgin Atlantic.
The US joined a host of Virgin's Caribbean destinations where on-board masking is optional, but passengers must 
wear masks on flights to destinations including South Africa, Hong Kong and India.
Lufthansa and Air France have not changed their policies. They require passengers to wear a surgical face mask 
on board, regardless of where they are flying.
In the US, Uber, Lyft and Amtrak lifted mask rules, as the CDC order applied to ride-sharing and rail passengers. 
New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Chicago Transit Authority, which oversee the country's two 
largest public transport systems, are keeping mask orders in place.
The Biden administration is contemplating whether to appeal against the judge's ruling.
Several UK carriers including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, as well as Heathrow airport, dropped blanket rules 
requiring passengers to wear masks last month, as government measures against Covid-19 were dropped.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, has kept the requirement to wear a www.mask.UK carriers 
followed suit but German and French peers have not changed their policies

Did Ryanair turn away a fleeing Ukrainian family because they couldn't print their boarding passes?
Did Ryanair turn away a fleeing Ukrainian family because they couldn't print 
their boarding passes?

A Ukrainian family of three, who fled war-torn Kyiv in search of safety in the UK, were forced to miss their flight to 
the Midlands due to Ryanair's pre-departure checks.
Venera Muminova, her partner, Azamat, and their two-year old daughter, Kamila, were due to stay with couple 
Michelina and Richard Primrose in Nottingham.
The two families connected via a Ukrainian Facebook group, after the British couple failed to hear back from the UK 
Home Office's scheme aimed at helping those escaping the Russia - Ukraine conflict.
Muminova and her family were left without a home, after Russian shells targeted and destroyed it several weeks 
ago.
According to Michelina Primrose, Azamat continuously tried to check-in online but due to a lack of internet 
connection, was unable to do so successfully. They also did not have access to a printer.
After turning up three-hours prior to the flight's departure, the family were faced with questions over the father's 
passport, as he is a Turkmenistan national - which means he is not required to fight in Ukraine. But with all three 
family members equipped with UK visas, this should not have been a problem.
Ongoing issues
Trouble continued, as the airline then demanded the family pay £50 ((EURO)60) to have their boarding passes 
printed by the airline.
The family contacted the Primroses, who agreed to cover the extra cost. But, after joining the queue again, they 
were told that it was 'too late' as 'the gate [had] shut five minutes ago.'
In fact, there was still over an hour until the plane was expected to depart. Michelina spoke to a member of 
Ryanair's staff, and asked to speak with a manager to explain that the family were fleeing Ukraine.
"She was not having it," says Michelina, "she wouldn't let me speak to a manager, was not showing any sympathy, 
said they could have downloaded it in Ukraine."
Did Ryanair turn away a fleeing Ukrainian family because they couldn't print their boarding passes?
"I was trying to explain, they just don't have the facilities to do that," she adds.
With a lack of options and time running out, Michelina directed Azamat to the Ryanair help desk to see what could 
be done. She explained the situation to a representative, who said the family would need to buy new tickets.
The initial tickets had cost the Primroses £196 ((EURO)237) but had since risen to £300 ((EURO)362). The next 
possible flight the family could take was eight hours later, arriving at London Stansted.
The flights were booked and paid for, but in the meantime, the family had to wait in the Polish airport with little 
access to facilities.
"They didn't have any money so they couldn't get any snacks," explains Michelina.
'Disgusted' and 'angry'
The Primroses tried to contact Ryanair by telephone, but were told a complaint would have to be made via the 
airline's website.
"I was disgusted, I was angry," says Michelina, who does not want this to happen to any other family.
In a statement made by the airline, Ryanair said they are happy to refund the £286 ((EURO)343) paid for the later 
flight between Krakow and Stansted.
The airline refutes the Primroses' claims that "prices for flights from Poland seem to be going up all the time."
Ryanair's website states, "If you arrive at the airport without your printed online boarding pass, we can print one for 
you, but you will be required to pay a 'Boarding Card Reissue Fee' of (EURO)£20."
Owed an apology
"They owe the family an apology", says Michelina. '[They] had to leave their loved ones, and to treat them like that 
is disgusting, they need to feel thoroughly ashamed of themselves." she adds.
According to the Primroses, the Ukrainian family has settled in, and there are lots of toys for Kamila. They are now 
doing "fine," Michelina explained.

Ryanair has announced a five-year heavy maintenance agreement with Jordan-based MRO provider Joramco 
Aircraft Maintenance, which will see the airline utilising up to six heavy maintenance bay slots at its facility in 
Amman.
Ryanair's fleet will grow to more than 600 aircraft over the coming years and this agreement will ensure that the 
airline has flexibility as to where it places its aircraft for winter maintenance season.
The airline uses a mix of internal facilities and external suppliers to conduct its heavy maintenance. Ryanair 
continues to invest in its own internal heavy maintenance facilities and this agreement will complement these 
facilities to ensure the airline's maintenance requirements are more than met over the coming years.
Ryanair's Director of Operations, Neal McMahon, said: "We are pleased to extend and enhance our agreement with 
Joramco, who have been providing ad hoc maintenance for our fleet for the past three years. This agreement will 
allow Ryanair to utilise up to six heavy maintenance slots, with aircraft coming in nose to tail for the next five winter 
seasons. Joramco is a long-established maintenance provider with state-of-the-art facilities with over 50 customers 
around the world. It has an excellent reputation for a quality service offering in the industry and we are pleased to 
be announcing this new and enhanced deal."
Joramco's Chief Executive Officer, Fraser Currie, said: "We are delighted that Ryanair has selected Joramco to be 
its trusted MRO provider as Ryanair grows its fleet. This long-term partnership is a result of Joramco's world-class 
expertise and efficient services. This growth comes after completion of another successful winter season with 
Ryanair. This deal is a significant factor in our strategic growth and road map, which is expected to see an increase 
in Joramco's footprint."

Spain 's Air Europa to sublease 787s from Norse Atlantic
Spain's Air Europa to sublease 787s from Norse Atlantic

Air Europa (UX, Palma de Mallorca) has announced plans to add 11 new aircraft to its fleet during the course of 
2022, including four B787s on medium-term sublease contracts from Norse Atlantic Airways (Oslo Gardermoen).
The Spanish carrier plans to add five B787s in total. The four subleased from Norse Atlantic Airways comprise two 
B787-8s and two B787-9s. Subject to the finalisation of the agreement, the quartet will be delivered to Air Europa 
during the second quarter of 2022. The sublease will last for at least 18 months.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that Norse Atlantic Airways plans to have three B787-8s and twelve 
-9s in its early fleet, on lease from AerCap (the -8s and six -9s) and BOC Aviation (six -9s). However, the nascent 
long-haul low-cost carrier recently deferred its launch by three months and will not require all of the aircraft during 
the ramp-up phase of its operations.
"This sublease agreement with Air Europa provides a compelling opportunity to generate positive cash flow from 
aircraft that we were not planning to fully utilise in our start-up phase. The agreement strengthens our already solid 
financial position as we continue to stay true to our strategy of cautiously entering the market and ramping up based 
on customer demand," Chief Executive Bjørn Tore Larsen said.
Air Europa did not disclose any details concerning the variant or the source of the fifth B787 and the six B737s, 
other than stating they would "be added progressively over the coming months". However, the El Economista daily 
has reported that the B737s will be B737-800s formerly operated by Ukraine International Airlines (two), Malindo Air 
(two), Ryanair, and one of the TUI Group carriers (one each).
The airline did not respond to ch-aviation's request for clarification.
The Spanish carrier's fleet currently comprises fourteen B737-800s, eight B787-8s, and ten B787-9s. It also wet-

Air Europa (UX, Palma de Mallorca) has announced plans to add 11 new aircraft to its fleet during the course of 
2022, including four B787s on medium-term sublease contracts from Norse Atlantic Airways (Oslo Gardermoen).
The Spanish carrier plans to add five B787s in total. The four subleased from Norse Atlantic Airways comprise two 
B787-8s and two B787-9s. Subject to the finalisation of the agreement, the quartet will be delivered to Air Europa 
during the second quarter of 2022. The sublease will last for at least 18 months.
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that Norse Atlantic Airways plans to have three B787-8s and twelve 
-9s in its early fleet, on lease from AerCap (the -8s and six -9s) and BOC Aviation (six -9s). However, the nascent 
long-haul low-cost carrier recently deferred its launch by three months and will not require all of the aircraft during 
the ramp-up phase of its operations.
"This sublease agreement with Air Europa provides a compelling opportunity to generate positive cash flow from 
aircraft that we were not planning to fully utilise in our start-up phase. The agreement strengthens our already solid 
financial position as we continue to stay true to our strategy of cautiously entering the market and ramping up based 
on customer demand," Chief Executive Bjørn Tore Larsen said.
Air Europa did not disclose any details concerning the variant or the source of the fifth B787 and the six B737s, 
other than stating they would "be added progressively over the coming months". However, the El Economista daily 
has reported that the B737s will be B737-800s formerly operated by Ukraine International Airlines (two), Malindo Air 
(two), Ryanair, and one of the TUI Group carriers (one each).
The airline did not respond to ch-aviation's request for clarification.
The Spanish carrier's fleet currently comprises fourteen B737-800s, eight B787-8s, and ten B787-9s. It also wet-
leases a single A320-200 from Iberojet (Spain) (E9, Palma de Mallorca).

Smooth flying for Wizz Air as staff levels unaffected

WIZZ Air UK has not been affected by the current wave of Covid-19 infections that has forced other airlines to slash 
hundreds of flights, the airline's UK chief Marion Geoffroy has said.
"We haven't seen an increase in the number of infected employees and we haven't had to cancel any flights," she 
told City A.M. "But we have to be very humble with the crisis because it gets better and then it gets worse again."
The Budapest-based but London-listed airline appears to be taking off following the end of travel restrictions, with 
demand increasing in all markets ahead of the Easter peak.
Wizz reported earlier this month that passenger demand in March peaked at 2.5m at a load factor of 86.2 per cent.
"We absolutely see customer confidence is back and we see good bookings for the summer already," Geoffroy 
explained, while adding the airline will operate at 100 per cent of its capacity during the summer.
While most airlines suffered substantial losses from the pandemic, Wizz Air has emerged as one of the carriers to 
now be exceeding pre-Covid levels.
The company entered Covid-19 being "financially stable and sustainable" and seized every opportunity to expand 
its UK operations, Geoffrey said.
Capitalising on rivals' inability to maintain airport slots under EU and UK rules, Wizz acquired an additional 15 slots 
at Gatwick in December , while last week it opened its latest base in Cardiff.
"We are in the regions, we are in London, we are in all the segments and we keep growing," Geoffroy explained.
Smooth flying for Wizz Air as staff levels unaffected
Alongside low-cost competitors such as Ryanair, the carrier lobbied against legacy airlines retaining their airport 
slots if unable to use them.
In January, chief executive Jozsef Varadi called the practice "a way of distorting the market".
Wizz Air's positive streak continued against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, which forced the airline to halt all 
operations.
"We eventually want to restart our operations, but it's a matter of when we believe the time is right," Geoffroy 
concluded.

LCCs have played a significant role in Asia's tourism industry growth
LCCs have played a significant role in Asia's tourism industry growth

Highlight: Increasing numbers of LCCs (Low-Cost Carriers) have helped drive increasing numbers of Asian airline 
passengers, with the middle class a major contributor to increased air travel.
Body
LCCs provide a significant economic advantage for Asian countries since it positively impacts multiple sectors in 
addition to the aviation industry, such as overall employment, GDP, trade, tourism, and productivity. Improved 
airline infrastructure and promotion across AsiaImproving the awareness of cheaper air travel fares to the world's 
most populous continent was a major challenge. LCCs have been successful in reaching out to a growing middle 
class by using digital marketing and other marketing techniques like SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and online 
adverts. 
 Airline discounts and rewards programs have also attracted a lot of customers, especially in domestic tourism. 
Infrastructure and deregulation have also had a considerable impact on the Asian LCC market. Many countries 
such as China, India, Malaysia and the Philippines, have been proactive in matching infrastructure demands 
through the easing of regulations and development of more regional airports. This strategy has proven successful in 
helping Asia's LCC market. As per GlobalData's Market Competitor Insights Database, the number of LCC seats 
sold increased by 279% from 2009 to 2019 across China, India, Malaysia and Philippines, contributing to a 225% 
rise in domestic and outbound trips within these countries. Naturally, the pandemic impacted these figures 
throughout 2020 and 2021. However, the economic strains may actually accelerate demand for LCCs in the long 
term. A proven business model which meets market demand for low faresWhile many travellers have complained 
about the decline in quality of service within aviation, the number of complaints was not unusually high in 
comparison to the larger number of air travellers. This was due to the fact that, after accounting for inflation, airfares 
fell significantly. Customers have often understood that they get what they pay for. According to GlobalData's Q3 
2021 Global Consumer Survey, when asked "Which factors help you decide where to go on holiday "an average of 
62% consumers from China, India, Malaysia and Philippines agreed that they consider "Affordability", which is in 
favour of LCCs. LCCs in Asia offer significant airfare discounts due to their higher efficiency and better fleet 
utilisation. Furthermore, their adoption of ticketless travel and online presence allow them to reach a growing 
number of online users across Asia. This type of business model has long been successful in North America and 
LCCs have played a significant role in Asia's tourism industry growth
Europe, creating household names within the aviation sector such as Southwest Airlines, Ryanair and easyJet. 
Moving forwards LCCs in Asia will play a significant role in the tourism industry's recovery on the continent, building 
on strong initial growth before the pandemic.

easyJet still faces 'bumpy journey' even as capacity returns towards pre-pandemic levels
easyJet still faces 'bumpy journey' even as capacity returns towards pre-
pandemic levels

easyJet PLC trimmed its losses in the first half as it increased capacity back towards pre-pandemic levels, though it 
continued to be hampered by increasing numbers of crew testing positive for Covid-19.
The budget airline, which has cancelled hundreds of flights in the past few days, said its half-year losses would 
be between £535mln and £565mln, which was below the £618mln average City forecast. A year earlier it made 
a £701mln loss and for the full year it was £1.1bn. 
For the second quarter to 31 March, 67% of capacity was flown, up from 60% in the first quarter, with March at 80% 
capacity. Passenger numbers of 11.5mln for the quarter were up nearly tenfold on the preceding period.
Over the last seven days, easyJet revealed its has cancelled 6% of its scheduled flights, amid increases in the 
number of crew testing positive for Covid-19.
"We have proactively managed this in advance by making pre-emptive cancellations as early as possible, enabling 
the majority of our customers to rebook onto flights departing the same day," it said.
For the third quarter, capacity is expected to be around 90% of 2019 levels, with sales for the fourth quarter said to 
be "near" equivalent levels from the year before the pandemic.
With oil prices elevated and a metric tonne fetching around US$1,100 yesterday, the FTSE 250 company said it has 
around 64% hedging for the second half of the year at circa US$571 per tonne, around 42% hedging for the first 
half of next year at roughly US$654 and is about 15% hedged for the second half of next year.
easyJet still faces 'bumpy journey' even as capacity returns towards pre-pandemic levels
Chief executive Johan Lundgren said: "Since travel restrictions were removed, easyJet has seen a strong recovery 
in trading which has been sustained, resulting in a positive outlook for Easter and beyond, with daily booking 
volumes for summer currently tracking ahead of those at the same time in FY19."
The shares rose in initial trading before dropping into the red and were down 1.7% to 533.5p by mid-morning.
Allegra Dawes, senior airlines analyst at Third Bridge, said the capacity increases do point to the market's 
continued recovery, but the company "faces rising costs due to fuel pricing and operation ramp up and continued 
operational difficulties as a result of covid-19 and staffing shortages. The road to a full recovery remains long and 
bumpy."
While easyJet is not exposed to routes in the Ukraine or Russia, ThirdBridge analysts expect volatility in jet fuel 
pricing to further slow the pace of the airline's recovery. 
"EasyJet has lost ground within the low-cost segment of the market as Ryanair and WizzAir have both operated 
more efficiently and aggressively during the pandemic. While EasyJet has lost ground in markets like Italy and 
Spain, it has a strong position on routes to Portugal and France, positioning it to benefit from summer travel to 
these countries," Dawes said.
With challenges at its key bases in the UK from staffing shortages, she said "customers and investors will be 
concerned over the airline's ability to ramp up operations to meet higher demand in the summer holiday season and 
Third Bridge experts expect to see continued delays, cancellations, and frustration for passengers".

Italy's Treasury has invited several "primary operators in the airline sector" interested in acquiring a majority stake in 
ITA Airways (AZ, Rome Fiumicino) to express formal interest in the airline by April 18, ministerial sources have told 
both Reuters and the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
Lufthansa (LH, Frankfurt Int'l) has expressed an interest in buying a stake in Alitalia's state-owned successor in a 
joint bid with shipping group MSC, requesting an exclusivity period to conclude the details, but Rome has insisted 
on a market-based procedure to encourage other suitors to come forward. The government wants to finalise a deal 
to sell the flag carrier by June 20, although a proliferation of advisers now engaged in the privatisation process has 
reportedly caused tensions in the airline's leadership.
"The advisers have invited several players in the airline sector to formalise their interest in ITA," one of the sources 
told Reuters on April 8.
Sources told Corriere that the advisers interested parties should send their bids to are the Italian investment bank 
Equita and law firm Gianni & Origoni, which are acting as the Treasury's financial and legal advisers in the process. 
A deadline of April 18 should allow the government to open the ITA Airways data room of sensitive financial 
information to interested parties by the end of April, they added.
Besides MSC and Lufthansa, sources have told local media that low-cost carrier funder Indigo Partners and 
Certares, an investment fund reportedly working with Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines on the move, have also 
privately expressed an interest in buying into ITA Airways.
Treasury personnel are also believed to have contacted other major European aviation players, informing them that 
they too can send expressions of interest. Sources told the newspaper that this includes IAG International Airlines 
Group, easyJet, and Ryanair. But they do not expect any further bids to materialise other than the three above - 
contacting other operators is necessary, they explained, to avoid any future disputes with the European 
Commission.

Apr 09, 2022( Dale & Co.: http://www.iaindale.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 From a listener to my LBC show... 
I'm a big fan, I listen to your show every day. This is about a Passport disappointment (I can't say passport hell 
because there's so much going on in this world). BUT, I think people need to be warned about this because lots of 
family's getting caught out at airports and sent home. I was travelling to Italy yesterday with my wife and four young 
boys, already checked in and ready to travel, only to be stopped at passport control and told I couldn't travel on my 
fully valid British/EU Passport because although it has 1-year until expiry, the EU no longer accept passports older 
than ten years (mine was ten years and a few days). 
Furthermore, we were sent to Ryanair Customer services to be told by their Italian representative that 'it's our own 
fault for leaving the EU' and that it's also our fault for lying when completing the online checkin. LYING just what you 
need at a time like this. They said we were lying because I put in the expiry date printed on my passport and not the 
expiry date I should have calculated from the issue dateso the passport expiry date for EU countries is irrelevant! 
Thepassport has to be within 9-years and 9 months or six depending on which European country. 
So, Iphoned the passport office and left my number, they promptly called me back and suggested I go to the 
passport office in Eccleston Square in Londonand get a same day emergency passport. 
Great I thought. So I insisted my wife kids travel without me, I'd go to London, update my passport and catch them 
up Monday latest. Off they went sobbing. One of my little boys had a panick attack on the flight but need to say he's 
okay now. 
Get to the passport office and join the queue. WOWso much pushing and shoving and shouting from other people. 
It was awful. Every time I got to the front, someone who'd already been chased off jumped back in front. Everyone 
with their own issue. 
Well the UK's idea of an emergency passport is earliest appointment 18-days later. I would imagine it's no longer an 
emergency three weeks later!?! 
And I was not the only one caught out like this. There were four other people in my queue traveling with young kids, 
only to be told the same thing. 
There is nothing I can see on the UK passport website which warns you about this, it just states that so long as you 
have more than six months on your passport it is valid. But EU countries no longer accept this. 
Iain, Please warn people about this so they don't turn up at the airport and get turned away.It would be so helpful if 
you could help spread the message to warn people that the expiry date on their British passport doesn't matter. EU 
If You're Going to Italy (or the Rest of the EU): A Warning
countries are deciding if a passport is valid or not and their criteria is sometimes different from country to country. 
Lots of people getting caught out on this. 
You have been warned. And it seems this isn't just concerning Italy, it's the whole of the EU. I always thought as 
long as you had 6 months left on your passport you were OK to travel. Not to the EU, it seems, any longer. The 
date of expiration on my listener's passport was 1 December 2022.

'behind-closed-doors' Randox Grand National.
However, one notable absentee this year is Tiger Roll, who will not be bidding for a historic third win in the world's 
most famous race as connections opted to retire him last month.
Gigginstown House Stud, the racing operation of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, still run five in the race, headed by 
DELTA WORK who memorably denied Tiger Roll his fairy-tale swansong at the Cheltenham Festival. He seemed to 
come alive over the quirky cross-country fences last month and brings a backlog of form that has seen him mix it 
with the very best.
Don't forget he was good enough to finish fifth in a Cheltenham Gold
Cup a couple of years ago and this step up in trip may be just what he's been crying out for.
The combination of class and stamina means he has to be on any shortlist, while every drop of rain that falls will 
help his chances.
Gigginstown saddle four others including Samcro, Coko Beach, Death Duty and RUN WILD FRED.
Despite being a former Cheltenham Festival winner, Samcro looks a shadow of his former self and this trip should 
prove too much.
SECOND CAN TURN THIRD INTO FIRST THIS TIME AROUND
Coko Beach may be out of his depth too, while Death Duty is interesting if the ground got really soft.
Run Wild Fred is ridden by Tiger Roll's jockey Davy Russell and is ultraconsistent. The eight-year-old has finished 
runner-up in six of his last seven starts, but they include silver medals in both the Irish Grand National and the 
National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham. He can be backed each-way at 20/1 and looks a lively outsider as he jumps 
and stays well.
Last year's winner Minella Times is back for more under his record-breaking pilot Rachael Blackmore.
He's failed to complete his two starts this campaign and life is a lot tougher off a 15 pounds higher mark.
ANY SECOND NOW ran a gallant race last year to finish third behind Minella Times having been badly hampered 
by a faller at the 12th fence.
He's seven pounds higher than last season but meets the winner on eight pounds better terms and arrives here in 
great form.
He gave weight and a beating to another of today's rivals in Escaria Ten last time and he looks sure to run his race.
Ted Walsh won this race back in 2000 with Papillon so knows how to ready one for this and he gets the vote at 9/1 
with William Hill.
Another trainer with previous in this race is Martin Brassil, who saddled 2005 winner Numbersixvalverde. That 
horse had landed the previous year's Thyestes Chase, and he'll be hoping his LONGHOUSE POET can do 
something similar tomorrow.
The eight-year-old has only had six starts over fences, but both times he's been handed a three-mile plus 
assignment he's been successful.
In December 2020, he beat another of my fancies, Run Wild Fred, in a beginners chase over 3m1f at Punchestown 
on heavy ground, showing that stamina is his forte.
He was off the track for a year after that and following a pipe-opener at
Limerick over Christmas he beat Franco De Port to give his trainer a second Theystes in January.
Once again, he was strongest at the finish and even though he would prefer the ground to be a bit softer than it 
probably will be tomorrow, he looks the right type for this test.
The make-up of the Grand National has changed since the important changes were implemented a few years ago.
It isn't as much of a test as it was and that has seen eight-year-olds win four of the last six renewals.
Irish-trained horses have also won four of the last five renewals, so this son of Yeats ticks plenty of boxes and looks 
a good each-way bet at around 16/1.
Big-priced horses have a habit of sneaking into the places in the National and there are plenty to consider amongst 
the 40 runners this year.
Blaklion has danced every dance here and would be a great bet to finish in the first seven or eight, 2019 Ladbrokes 
Trophy winner De Rasher Counter is interesting back off the same mark and Kildisart is another I wouldn't be ruling 
out.
However, Henry Daly's FORTESCUE managed to sneak in at number 40 and I can see him running a very big 
race.
SECOND CAN TURN THIRD INTO FIRST THIS TIME AROUND
He is an excellent jumper and it was a career best last time out when he outstayed Fiddlerontheroof to win the 
Swinley Chase at Ascot.
Prior to that he was third to Royale
Pagaille in the Peter Marsh Chase, beaten just three and a quarter lengths, which was another fine effort. 
Unexposed over marathon distances and off just 10st 6lbs, he can still be backed at 33/1 which looks too big.

Apr 07, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, JetBlue Airways JBLU[1] offered $3.6 billion to buy Spirit Airlines SAVE[2]. JetBlue's $3.6-billion 
bid, equivalent to $33 per share in cash, represents a premium of 50% to its closing share price on Apr 4, 2022. 
European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was also in the news owing to its upbeat traffic. Owing to the sunny 
scenario with respect to passenger traffic, RYAAY narrowed its forecast for fiscal 2022 net loss. Delta Air Lines 
DAL[4] was another newsmaker, courtesy of its fleet-modernization exercise. Gol Linhas' GOL[5] March traffic 
report was impressive, reflecting the uptick in air-travel demand in Brazil. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. 
JetBlue's all-cash offer, on materialization, would create the fifth-largest domestic airline, giving tough competition 
to the big four U.S. carriers. The Spirit Airlines deal is expected to help JetBlue expand its footprint in New York and 
Florida. The merger will help JBLU expand across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America. The 
combined entity would offer more than 1,700 daily flights to over 130 destinations in 27 countries. The transaction is 
expected to generate $600-700 million in net annual synergies upon completion of integration. The combined 
company is predicted to generate annual revenues of approximately $11.9 billion (based on 2019 revenues). 
Excluding integration costs, the transaction is expected to be accretive to JetBlue's earnings per share in the first 
full year.[6] 
JetBlue was also in the news recently when it decided to add 5,000 jobs in the New York City this year to meet the 
uptick in air-travel demand. The story was covered in the previous week's write-up[7]. 
2. To modernize its fleet, Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), announced that it will start operating its 
first of 155 new Airbus A321neo aircraft from May 20, 2022. The debut flight using a new aircraft will take off from 
Delta's Boston hub and head for San Fransisco. In the coming months, Delta will further expand flight services on 
the Airbus A321neo plane to include destinations like Denver, San Diego and Seattle. While flights to Seattle will 
begin operating on Aug 11, services to San Diego and Denver will commence from Aug 20[8]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9]. 
3. Owing to expanded passenger volumes, Ryanair now expects a loss in fiscal 2022 in the €350-€400 million 
range. The earlier outlook was of a loss in the €250-€450 million band. The forecast of a narrower loss comes on 
the back of an uptick in air traffic at Ryanair for the month of March, which exceeded the pre-pandemic levels. 
Airline Stock Roundup: JBLU 's $3.6 B Bid to Buy SAVE , RYAAY's Better View & More
Evidently, in March 2022, RYAAY transported 11.2 million passengers[10], above the 0.5 million carried in March 
2021, 5.5 million in March 2020 and 10.9 million in the pre-pandemic era of March 2019. 
4. In March, Gol Linhas' consolidated traffic jumped 113.9% year over year. To match the increased demand 
situation, GOL is expanding its capacity. In the same month, capacity grew 93% year over year. Since traffic growth 
was more than capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved 7.7 percentage 
points (p.p) to 79.5% last month. 
Upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to the rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In March, domestic 
traffic and capacity improved 106.4% and 86.1%, respectively. On the domestic front, 119.3% more passengers 
boarded GOL's flights in March 2022. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major 
airline players over the past week and during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that all airline stocks, apart from Spirit Airlines, traded in the red over the past week. The 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index decreased 3.73% to $77.52. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index declined 19.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will keep an eye on the first-quarter 2022 
earnings report of Delta, scheduled to be released on Apr 13.

Ryanair summer fares to be hiked 10 per cent as demand strengthens
Ryanair summer fares to be hiked 10 per cent as demand strengthens

RYANAIR's summer fares are expected to go up between five and 10 per cent of 2019 levels, its boss Michael 
O'Leary said this morning.
The chief executive said lower capacity and very strong forward bookings have already started driving demand up 
from June onwards.
"What we're seeing at the moment is prices are slightly lower than they were in 2019, pre-Covid, through March, 
April and May," he told the Irish Independent. "They're somewhere between five and 10 per cent higher at the 
moment through June, July, August and September.
"I think fares will be up this year in the peak summer months by between five and 10 per cent."
O'Leary's comments follow Monday's announcement that March passenger numbers for the first time topped pre-
Covid levels.
Despite this, the carrier's guidance for the year hit turbulence this week when Ryanair warned shareholders losses 
would be between (EURO)350m (£291m) and (EURO)400m, while previously guiding to a range between 
(EURO)250m and (EURO)400m.

Slovakia drops both the e-Boarder registration mandate, as well as the quarantine for non-vaccinated travellers 
mandate as of April 6th 2022.
Travellers entering Slovakia will not be required to register in the so-called e-Boarder, the equivalent of ePLF, after 
Wednesday 6th April 2022. Mandatory quarantine for non-vaccinated travellers will be dropped on the same day.
Slovakia joins the list of countries, which dropped their boarder restrictions lately. As of Wednesday, 6th April 2022, 
it is no longer mandatory to get registered in the e-Boarder registry. Moreover, non-vaccinated travellers will not be 
required to undertake mandatory quarantine if arriving after 6th April. Visitors of Slovakia will enjoy seamless arrival 
and less pre-travel byrocracy thanks to the dropped mandates.
With Omicron wave on the descend and the virus spread under control, one of the latest public health precautions 
remaining in place in Slovakia is the face mask mandate in public buildings and public vehicles. Wearing the face 
covering is still required in public offices, shops, other public buildings and on mass events indoors. If the pandemic 
situation remains under control, the mask mandate could be dropped later in April.
In this S22 IATA season, Bratislava will have connection with 35 destinations by direct scheduled routes, including 
London, Milan, Copenhagen or Dubai. The latest additions to the network are the Croatian capital of Zagreb, 
Trapani in Sicily and Dalaman in Turkey all operated by Ryanair. The connectivity is increased between Bratislava 
and Sofia, with Ryanair launching a 3-weekly schedule in addition to Wizz Air´s 3-weekly flights. The network from 
Bratislava is back to 80% of its pre-Covid size, with some destinations being replaced by newer ones.

Airline bosses slam Single European Sky delays and taxes
Airline bosses slam Single European Sky delays and taxes

Airline bosses have heavily criticised European governments for targeting aviation with green taxes while not doing 
enough to bring about the Single European Sky initiative that would reduce fuel consumption by up to 15% and 
significantly reduce CO2 emissions.
Speaking during a panel discussion at the Airlines for Europe (A4E) 2022 Aviation Summit in Brussels on March 31, 
easyJet (U2, London Luton) Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren described as "quite frankly shameful" 
increased ticket taxes "that did nothing to decarbonise" aviation.
He was understood to be referring to Dutch government plans to hike aviation passenger taxes from EUR7.8 euros 
(USD8.6) per ticket to EUR24 (USD26.3) per ticket from January 1, 2023, on all flights departing from Dutch 
airports. The higher tax reportedly is to increase tax revenue from EUR200 million (USD219.3 million) to EUR600 
million (USD658.1 million) a year.
It follows an existing passenger tax imposed on January 1, 2021, intended to reduce price differences between 
airline and train tickets. The Dutch government's plan is just one part of its Recovery and Resilience Plan to be 
presented to the European Union, a first draft of which was presented to the House of Representatives on March 
28. EU member countries agreed on a COVID-19 recovery fund of EUR750 billion (USD822.7 billion) in 2020. To 
obtain funds, at least 37% of the expenditure must be spent on climate-related investments.
Lundgren said if implemented, the Single European Sky would result in an immediate 15% fuel saving for easyJet, 
significantly reducing CO2 emissions for an average flight. "This is one of the biggest things that we can do short-
term," he said, pointing out that some of the governments that were pointing fingers at aviation for contributing to 
CO2 emissions were themselves blocking sustainability progress by dragging their feet on the Single European 
Sky. The EU initiative was launched in 1999 to reform air traffic management (ATM) and air navigation services in 
Europe by reducing the fragmentation of European airspace. This would imply reducing delays, increasing safety 
standards and flight efficiency to reduce the aviation environmental footprint, and reducing costs related to service 
provision.
Other panellists echoed Lundgren's views, including Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary and 
Lufthansa Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr.
Airline bosses slam Single European Sky delays and taxes
"It's the European governments that are holding up the urgent reforms our industry needs," O'Leary said, saying the 
aviation industry needed to be more robust in pushing back and calling out European transport ministers for not 
having expedited the Single European Sky and protecting overflight rights during national strikes. "At Ryanair, we're 
investing EUR20 billion (USD21.9 billion) in new aircraft technology for the next five years. These planes will fly 4% 
more passengers, but they [will] burn 15% less fuel. We are making - as an industry - huge investments in new 
technology to make the services we provide more environmentally sustainable."
"I think there's been a degree of misinformation, and as an industry, I don't think we have fought back robustly 
enough, pointing out the fact that aviation accounts for 2% of Europe's CO2 emissions, [whereas] shipping 
accounts for 4%," he added.
Spohr - who is A4E's 2022 chairman - said European governments needed to lead by example when asking airlines 
to do more to be environmentally efficient. "I think it undermines authority. I love chocolate and that makes it very 
difficult for me to tell my kids not to eat chocolate because they always tell me, dad, you're eating it yourself. That's 
a little bit how we have to approach this. How can they put pressure on us, certain politicians, when they are not 
willing to do their own part," he asked.
A4E chief executives, in a statement at the summit, called on European policy-makers to take urgent action on key 
legislative proposals that would strengthen airlines' recovery prospects, protect and accelerate decarbonisation 
efforts, and help rebuild passenger connectivity.
"Key policies must be re-assessed and swiftly updated to help airlines mitigate rising costs on multiple fronts and 
operate more efficiently. For example, more cost-efficient air navigation services for flights within Europe could be 
realised along with an up to 10% reduction in CO2 emissions by implementing the Single European Sky, which 
remains in trilogue negotiations between the European Council, the European Parliament, and the European 
Commission."
"Without appropriate mitigation measures, future energy and climate policies will erode airlines' competitiveness 
and lead to carbon leakage," they warned.
The chief executives reiterated their commitment to reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and to support 
European carbon reduction targets, but stressed the need for global climate action and pricing support measures to 
level the playing field. They called for global uniform regulation, including a global carbon price for aviation that 
would stimulate low carbon technology development and use EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances to 
support the uptake of sustainable fuels.
"Europe can become a global leader in decarbonising aviation. But achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 should 
not erode the competitiveness of European airlines nor lead to carbon leakage," said Spohr. "To be successful, 
policies must be designed to avoid distorting competition between European stakeholders within the single aviation 
market, as well as between European and non-European airlines."
"Given the multiple crises European carriers are now facing - whether energy, consumer health, or geopolitical - a 
thorough re-evaluation of the aviation regulatory landscape has become an absolute necessity", agreed A4E 
Managing Director Thomas Reynaert.

Flying higher Ryanair losses to be at lower end of forecast

Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair has said its losses for the year to March 31 will be towards the lower end 
of its predictions.
The airline said it expected preexceptional losses for the financial year just ended to be in the (EURO)350mn to 
(EURO)400mn range. It previously gave a range of (EURO)250mn to (EURO)450mn.
It also said passenger numbers had recovered to 97mn for the year, against 27.5mn for the year to March 31, 2021, 
but were still well below the 149mn annual figure before the pandemic.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, has warned that the European airline industry's recovery has slowed in recent 
months, because of lockdowns imposed late last year to combat the Omicron coronavirus variant, and the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine.
Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at
Goodbody, said the changes to Ryanair's financial guidance were "slightly disappointing", but added that investors' 
focus "remains on the build-up of demand over the next two months" as the peak spring and summer season 
begins.
O'Leary has predicted a rapid recovery over the next 12 months thanks to pent-up demand for travel, when he 
expects Ryanair to carry more than 150mn passengers and swing back into profit, partly because it is well hedged 
against rising oil prices. The airline said yesterday it had hedged 80 per cent of its expected fuel requirements over 
the next 12 months.

Its net debt fell from (EURO)2.3bn to (EURO)1.5bn in the 12 months to the end of March.

The low-cost operator said it expects net losses to be between (EURO)350m (£293m) and (EURO)400m, after 
previously guiding to a range between (EURO)250m and (EURO)450m for the year to end of March.
The airline also confirmed it had successfully hedged around 80 per cent of its fuel costs for the next year.
The Dublin-based operator's chief executive Michael O'Leary last week guided investors towards the middle of the 
original range.
However O'Leary's predictions of a swift return to pre-pandemic passenger levels appears to have been more 
accurate, with 11.2m passengers travelling across the month of March.
That represented the strongest month since October of last year, with the recovery's take-off delayed by travel 
restrictions imposed by a host of European countries as the omicron variant emerged at the back end of 2021.
Passenger numbers hit 97m for the year to March, up from 27.2m for the year before. Pre-pandemic passenger 
numbers totalled 149m customers.
Ryanair rival Wizz Air saw a similar rebound, with passenger numbers surging significantly in March.
The Hungarian operator carried around 2.5m passengers in March, compared to 1.9m in February.

Holidaymakers have been warned to expect disruption when travelling over the spring and summer, as airlines and 
airports struggle to rehire staff after the pandemic.
The Easter getaway suffered a difficult start as British Airways and easyJet cancelled scores of flights yesterday 
because of staff shortages, including from rising Covid-19 infections.
Airlines had already cancelled 1,143 flights to and from the UK between March 28 and April 3, up from just 197 over 
the same period in 2019, according to data provider Cirium.
The cancellations come at the start of the first busy travel period since all Covid travel rules were removed.
Industry bosses have celebrated surging demand for foreign holidays after two years of pandemic restrictions. But 
they also fear that airports and airlines will be unable to handle the mass return of passengers after companies cut 
tens of thousands of jobs to help them survive the pandemic.
"Airlines are certainly seeing a high level of demand to fly but are simply unable to cope with that demand due to a 
lack of resources. It's a nightmare situation for airlines and airports at the moment," said Paul Charles, a travel 
industry consultant.
Cancelled flights cause chaos for holidaymakers Easter getaway. Travel disruption Warning of summer 
problems as surge in demand and lack of staff hit airports a....
Delta's chief executive said last month that UK delays were a "real concern" for his airline, while Ryanair boss 
Michael O'Leary has also questioned whether airports will be able to handle this summer's busiest periods.
The Airport Operators Association has warned that operations could face "some strain" in the coming months and 
told passengers to expect longer queues at peak times. Karen Dee, the lobby group's chief executive, blamed "a 
very competitive labour market" and delays in government security background checks on new staff.
One aviation executive said it was tak- ing much longer than usual for staff to go through background checks, partly 
because large sections of the travel industry had started recruiting simultaneously. BA, for example, laid off about 
10,000 staff in 2020 as the airline industry was plunged into crisis, and has outlined plans to rehire at least 3,000.
Manchester airport, the busiest outside London, faced chaos heading into the weekend as passengers reported 
waits of up to 30 hours and others missed their flights amid severe staff shortages.
During the height of the pandemic the airport laid off thousands of staff, pointing to an "absence of dedicated 
support for the sector" from the government. Since then it has struggled to recruit and train people fast enough to 
match the recovery in demand.
Unions believe the industry is reaping the consequences of firing too many workers during the pandemic. Unite 
general secretary Sharon Graham said: "We warned the aviation sector repeatedly not to use the cover of Covid to 
slash jobs and pay. This would render it unable to meet demand when passengers returned."
Others pin some blame on the end of the job retention scheme in September, when some furloughed workers were 
not rehired, and say key skills have been lost in the past two years.
Martin Chalk, head of pilots union Balpa, said he had raised the industry's lack of operational resilience "repeatedly" 
with aviation minister Robert Courts and others within government.
"UK aviation has benefited from less generous government support than other countries' airlines and is therefore in 
a weaker position to resource for this continued disruption," he said.
The problems have been exacerbated by the latest wave of Covid infections, driven by the highly infectious 
Omicron BA.2 sub-variant. "We have an unprecedented level of mild illness at the moment and that's obviously 
quite disruptive for the workforce," said Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University 
College London.
BA and easyJet cancelled 120 flights to and from the UK between them yesterday. EasyJet said it was 
"experiencing higher than usual levels of employee sickness" and that it had brought in extra crew to address the 
issue. It cancelled 60 flights into and out of the UK.
BA also cancelled 60 due to Covid absences and wider operational challenges. "While the vast majority of our 
flights continue to operate as planned, as a precaution we've slightly reduced our schedule between now and the 
end of May as we ramp back up," it said.
Separately, services on the Eurotunnel rail link between England and
France were delayed by up to five hours on Monday because of an earlier faulty train in the Channel Tunnel.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary expects average fare prices for June through September peak 
summer air travel to increase 5% to 10% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to media reports Tuesday.
O'Leary's forecast, first reported by the Irish Independent newspaper, may be visible from June onwards, if forward 
bookings are any indication, he said. He was also quoted as saying there aren't any "COVID scares" expected this 
summer. Lower capacity and increased demand appear to be the current price drivers, O'Leary was quoted as 
saying.
"Travel is recovering strongly. I think people are fed up. We have been locked up at home for the last two years on 
Zoom calls. They want to go travel again. Families want to go on holidays again," said O'Leary.
The airline company's shares were down 1.8% in recent early premarket trading Tuesday.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday that summer fares are expected to be 
5% to 10% higher compared with 2019 levels due to very strong forward bookings.
O'Leary told the Irish Independent that bookings are strong through June, July, August and September, thanks to 
pent-up demand.
Ryanair's passenger count for March surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time, Reuters noted in a same-day 
report.
Ryanair was down 1% in Tuesday morning trading.

Turbulent times for airlines may persist
Turbulent times for airlines may persist

Turbulent times are continuing for the airline industry and there are dark clouds ahead that could extend for some 
time yet.
Bad news came in triplicate for the sector at the start of the week, with British Airways owner the International 
Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) and easyJet plc (LSE:EZJ) both cancelling hundreds of flights, while 
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) issued a profit warning.
As passenger traffic has not recovered as much as it expected, Ryanair said losses are likely to be at the higher 
end of its previous expectations, with elevated fuel prices also poured into the mix for its new financial year.
Meanwhile, rival low-cost airline easyJet blamed high levels of staff absentees due to Covid for its decision to 
cancel more than 200 scheduled flights since last Friday.
BA also cancelled close to 100 flights for the same reason.
Some of the pain for the airline industry is self-inflicted, said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
BA owner IAG axed around 12,000 staff during the pandemic and has been accused of a blatant fire-and-rehire 
scheme as it looked to bring back cabin crew on substantially reduced terms and conditions.
So these new cancellations, said Mould, "stem from airlines and airports having insufficient staff to cope with rising 
demand", though he acknowledged that a resurgence in Covid cases has not helped, with many workers off sick.
Turbulent times for airlines may persist
"The broader aviation sector has been waiting for the magic moment where flying restrictions were lifted, and 
individuals regained their confidence to get on a plane again. With both forces now in motion one would have 
thought businesses that enable and support the flying experience would be making hay while the sun shines. 
Unfortunately, the sector's recovery is as chaotic as someone on their first flying lesson," Mould said.
Today's news showing long queues of people waiting to get on planes will put many others off from flying too, he 
suggested.
"Together these forces could result in tens of thousands of people saying they won't bother with flying again this 
year, and best to wait until everything has settled down.
"If the current disruption continues into the Easter weekend, we could easily see airlines like EasyJet have to 
downgrade their earnings forecasts."
Making matters worse is the fact that oil prices, which were already rising last year, have reached new multi-year 
highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is adding costs to airlines.
Ryanair said it has increased the level of fuel hedging for the current year and has even begun to put some in place 
for next year.
Analyst Alexander Paterson at Peel Hunt said: "The invasion of Ukraine and recent rises in Covid will inevitably 
have hampered demand and higher fuel prices will put some downward pressure on FY23 estimates."
However, he is more confident about underlying demand, seeing it as "robust" and so reiterated his 'buy' rating "in 
anticipation that trading will recover and the stock will rally once these near-term headwinds ease, with high fuel 
costs impacting competitors more than Ryanair given high levels of FY23 hedging at 75% and an increasingly 
efficient fleet".

FTSE 100 opened 12 points higher to 7,550 in spite of encircling gloom surrounding Ukraine. Asian markets were 
mixed on talk of even harsher sanctions on Russia touted. 
     EasyJet cancelled hundreds of flights over the weekend with more cuts scheduled today on renewed Covid 
disruption. Over 220 trips were axed as rising staff shortages hit the flight operator.    The UK government is set to 
nationalise Gazprom's British arm amid a standoff between the gas giant and an American bank. The move is 
expected to cost the taxpayer billions.     Ryanair narrowed its full-year loss forecast and hiked its fuel hedging to 
over 80%. It now expects to make a loss of (EURO)350-400mln.    Caledonia Mining increased its quarterly 
dividend payment by 17% as it outlined plans to increase production alongside its footprint in Zimbabwe. The

Among the small caps, Induction Healthcare said it has￿won contracts totalling £3.6mln for its Zesty digital 
platform. The group will support the transformation of outpatient care delivered by the South-West London 
Integrated Care System, which represents four NHS trusts in the capital.    i3 Energy's Canadian subsidiary had 
record reserves at the end of 2021, while the quarter just ended saw its highest production ever. Current output is 
also ahead of expectations, with the company upping its forecast for net income in 2022 to￿ US$192mln.

A renewed surge of Covid-19 in Britain has forced airlines including EasyJet to cancel hundreds of flights in recent 
days as staff sickness levels soar.
England dropped all its coronavirus restrictions earlier this year, including a legal requirement to self-isolate when 
testing positive and the need to wear masks in public places.
Cases started to surge in Britain near the beginning of last month and by the end of the March 26 week, one in 13 
people were believed to be positive with the virus, the highest figure since the pandemic began.
While hospitalisation levels are well below previous peaks in 2020 and 2021, companies are reporting disruption to 
services, including at airports.
EasyJet cancelled more than 200 flights at the weekend and said around 60 would be cancelled on Monday. British 
Airways also made a small number of cancellations on Sunday and said the issue was affecting airlines and airports 
in general.
EasyJet said it had appointed standby crews to soften the impact, and said when cancelling routes it would 
consolidate flights where it had multiple options.
"We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause to customers on affected flights," it said in a statement. 
"Customers have been contacted and provided with their options which include rebooking onto an alternative flight 
or receiving a voucher or full refund."
People testing positive for Covid-19 no longer need to self-isolate according to the law but most companies are 
advising them to do so. Free tests for the public are also no longer available.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday narrowed its annual forecast loss range as it reported a 
recovery in passenger numbers for March.
In March 2022, the Swords, Dublin-based airline flew 11.2 million passengers, bouncing back from just 500,000 a 
year ago. This was higher than pre-pandemic figures of 10.9 million in March 2019 and 10 million in March 2018. 
This was despite Ryanair cancelling 2,000 flights to and from Ukraine last month due to airspace closures following 
Russia's invasion.
In total, Ryanair operated over 67,800 flights in March with a load factor of 87%, up from 71% year-on-year.
Ryanair also said full-year traffic recovered strongly to over 97 million from 27.5 million in financial 2021, but 
remained below pre-Covid traffic of 149 million.  
In a newly released annual forecast, Ryanair expects a loss around EUR350 million to EUR400 million, narrowed 
from a previous guidance range of EUR250 million to EUR450 million, for its financial year ended March 31.
While the range has been trimmed, Ryanair's loss guidance at the mid-point has widened. However, this would still 
be an improvement on the net loss of EUR815 million in its previous financial year. In its pre-pandemic financial 
year 2020, Ryanair posted a profit of EUR1.00 billion.
The company will release its financial year 2022 results on May 16.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.5% at EUR13.33 in Dublin early Monday.

in the 350 million to 400 million euros ($386.6 million to $441.8 million) range. The company had previously guided 
for a loss in the EUR250 million to EUR450 million range. 
The budget airline said that it was 80% fuel hedged for fiscal 2023, and that almost 10% of its fuel requirements for 
the first half of fiscal 2024 were also hedged at $760 per metric ton. 
Fuel hedging refers to the practice of purchasing fuel at a certain date's price, as well as the use of other tools to 
hedge against moving oil prices. 
The company said that its net debt at March 31 stood at EUR1.5 billion, compared with EUR2.3 billion a year 
earlier.

Apr 04, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Betterment of air-travel demand led Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] to give an improved outlook for fiscal 2022 (ended 
Mar 31). Detailed results will be out on May 16. 
Owing to expanded passenger volumes, the European carrier, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects a 
loss in fiscal 2022 in the €350-€400 million range. The earlier outlook was of a loss in the €250-€450 million band. 
The forecast of a narrower loss comes on the back of an uptick in air traffic at Ryanair for the month of March, 
which exceeded the pre-pandemic levels. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2]. 
Evidently, in March 2022, RYAAY transported 11.2 million passengers, above the 0.5 million carried in March 2021, 
5.5 million in March 2020 and 10.9 million in the pre-pandemic era of March 2019. 
Due to increased traffic, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) rose to 87% in the month compared with 77% 
year ago. In February 2022, RYAAY attracted a traffic of 8.7 million passengers. The buoyant traffic data ahead of 
the Easter holidays certainly bodes well. The presence of these holidays this month is likely to boost traffic further. 
The improvement in air-travel demand despite headwinds like the Russia-Ukraine crisis is evident from the fact that 
air traffic at Ryanair exceeded 97 million in fiscal 2022, way above 27.5 million recorded in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 
2022 figure is, however, below the pre-pandemic peak level of 149 million. 
Some better-ranked stocks within the broaderTransportation[3]sector are as follows: 
USA TruckUSAK[4] currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. USAK's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
in three of the preceding four quarters (in line in one), the average surprise being 64.4%. 
Shares of USA Truck have increased 12% in the past six months. Improving freight conditions are aiding USAK. 
GATX CorporationGATX[5] currently flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1. GATX has an impressive surprise history, with its 
earnings having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average 
being 27.7%. 
Shares of GATX have also appreciated more than 32% in the past six months. Efforts to reward its shareholders 
through dividends and buybacks are very encouraging.

The soaring price of fuel threatens the airline industry's recovery just as passengers are returning to the skies.
As crude prices remain elevated, airline bosses face a critical calculation: how much of their fuel bill can they pass 
on to customers without leaving their planes empty?
The heads of Europe's biggest airlines met in person for the first time in two years this week at a conference in 
Brussels, each reporting a burst of demand as pandemic-related travel restrictions are rolled back.
Lufthansa's chief executive, Carsten Spohr, said his airline would fly more short-haul routes this summer than in 
2019, while British Airways owner IAG plans to return to pre-pandemic levels of transatlantic flying by the summer.
Leading the pack, Ryanair expects to fly 165mn passengers in this financial year, which began in April, up on 
150mn before the pandemic.
"There's big pent-up demand for the summer, there is just no doubt about that," said easyJet's chief executive, 
Johan Lundgren.
Jet fuel price surge threatens carriers' recovery; Airlines. Strategy test Operators hope to pass on extra costs 
without hindering travellers' return to skies
But the price of fuel - which can make up as much as a third of an airline's costs - threatens the profitability of this 
rapid recovery.
Jet fuel has risen by a third to more than $150 per barrel since Russia's invasion of Ukraine plunged commodity 
markets into turmoil. The rise to 14-year highs has outpaced even Brent crude, as airlines have been forced to pay 
a premium for the refined product.
US airlines have already indicated they will pass on the fuel costs to consumers, betting that passenger demand is 
robust enough to withstand it. Delta, for example, has said it needs to recoup between $15 and $20 each way on an 
average ticket value of about $200 to offset higher fuel costs.
Some airlines have introduced fuel surcharges, which are treated like government taxes that make new tickets 
more expensive and appear as extra charges when redeeming air miles. Air France and KLM have said long-haul 
flights will get more expensive. A KLM return flight from Amsterdam to New York will rise by (EURO)40 in economy 
class and (EURO)100 in business.
Spohr of Lufthansa was unequivocal that airlines needed to "make sure our business model still works" in an 
environment that also included higher airport and staff costs. "Inflation eventually hits every industry," he said.
Low-cost airlines are particularly vulnerable as fuel costs make up a higher proportion of overall ticket prices than 
their full-service competitors, which charge more for seats.
As higher inflation hits consumers, travellers hunting cheaper flights are likely to be more cost-sensitive, making it 
difficult to raise prices without hitting demand.
EasyJet's Lundgren said that "inevitably" airlines would have to bear some of the costs themselves, but added that 
deep cost cuts forced on the aviation industry by the pandemic would help cushion the blow.
"We're always got to make sure that we can offer really, really attractive fares for passengers. And pricing is super-
dynamic," he said.
Demand for travel this summer was strong, but outside of these peak periods customers still needed enticements, 
said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.
"I am sad to report that currently at Ryanair, ticket prices are falling in April and May, they are softer than in 2019," 
he said. "We are still trying to build back our forward bookings into the summer."
Ryanair is better protected than most, and has hedged 80 per cent of the fuel it expects to need this year at around 
$65 per barrel, a "fortuitous" decision that will help the company swing back into profit, O'Leary said.
Low-cost rival Wizz Air, whose shares have tumbled almost 40 per cent this year, went into the war unhedged, but 
reversed course and bought protection in March after the spot price had already soared.
Asked whether the rise in oil could turn out to be a surprise competitive advantage for Ryanair, O'Leary said his 
airline's growth was constrained by the number of new deliveries arriving from Boeing. But he expected it to drive 
home his "cost advantage" as the industry recovers.
Robert Boyle, a consultant and former head of strategy at IAG, said Ryanair could take advantage of its hedging 
position and strong balance sheet to squeeze its competitors.
"The Ryanair factor is going to make it hard for other airlines to raise prices without seeing a big hit to demand," he 
said.
"If they do it anyway and just cut more capacity to absorb the volume loss, they will be ceding even more market 
share to Ryanair. It's going to be a tough few months."

Italy has a new airline following the launch of charter operations by Aeroitalia on 26 April.
The airline is headquartered in Rome and has unveiled its first base in Forli.
It plans to operate a fleet of six Boeing 737-800s.
Its first aircraft is leased from Macquarie Airfinance. The aircraft had its first flight in 2001 and initially flew with 
South African Airways.
Aeroitalia will operate charter flights and then develop operations domestically with secondary routes.
Ex-Natixis Transport Finance chief financial officer Marc Bourgade is the sole shareholder in the start-up carrier.
The company has hired executive Gaetano Intrieri as its chief executive officer. Intrieri is a former adviser to Italy's 
minister of transport. Former Avianca owner Germ&n Efromovich has also joined the team as a consultant and 
board member.
Intrieri said the new Italian carrier will target former staff of Alitalia, Air Italy and Blue Panorama as it grows 
operations.
"We must admit that we have Ryanair as the absolute dominator of the Italian market, so we start with charter 
activities and then carve out space on less traveled national routes, for example Puglia with Foggia."
Aeroitalia is expected to announce short-haul domestic destinations from Forli this summer and also targets 
operations from Rome Fiumicino.

Boeing recorded 38 net orders in March after cancellations for 15 aircraft while over 140 aircraft were shifted from 
its firm orderbook in light of geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, data from the US manufacturer shows.
Cancellations included three Boeing 787-9s, two from lessor Avolon and one from Air China.
Another 11 737 Max orders were cancelled by undisclosed customers and one by USA-based lessor Aviation 
Capital Group.
Boeing's orders for March stemmed from lessor Air Lease with 32 737 Max units while unidentified customers 
ordered 14 737 Max  aircraft and one Boeing Business Jet. Boeing also registered orders for six 777Fs from DHL.
The company's backlog after ASC 606 accounting adjustments fell to 4,231 at the end of March from 4,375 at the 
end of February.
Boeing said the accounting adjustment included 141 aircraft removed from its firm order backlog due to impacts to 
credit quality as a result of international sanctions imposed on Russia.
These included 130 737 Max, eight 777 freighter and three 787 aircraft. Separately, eight 737 Max units and three 
787s were moved from ASC 606 back into its backlog.
Boeing data shows Russian operators Utair and Volgr-Dnepr UK have a total of 34 aircraft on order, including 28 
737 Max units and six 777Fs, respectively.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows Russian lessor Sberbank Leasing has orders for 14 737 Max aircraft due 
to be leased to Ural Airlines under 12-year operating leases.
Another 15 737 Max aircraft are on order from Timaero Ireland for delivery to its Russian parent company VEB 
Leasing. In 2019 Timaero Ireland sought to sue Boeing over a breach of contract relating to the grounding of the 
Max. Fleet Tracker shows the entity also has orders for 20 Airbus A320neos.
On the delivery side, Boeing handed over 41 aircraft to customers in March, versus 22 in February and up from 29 
aircraft in March last year.
Ukraine crisis puts strain on Boeing backlog
The 737 Max delivery highlights included six units delivered to Aeromexico, seven to Ryanair, three to Gol Linhas 
Aereas, four to Alaska Airlines, two to Air Canada and one each to Flydubai, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines.
Lessors accounted for six direct deliveries with 777 Partners, DAE Aerospace, Bain Capital and BOC Aviation each 
receiving one 737 Max and Air Lease taking two aircraft of the type.
For widebodies, 787 deliveries remained stalled in March with no new deliveries. Two 767-300Fs were handed over 
to FedEx while China Airlines received one 777F, according to the data.
Boeing reported 95 deliveries up to 31 March, including 86 737 Max aircraft, versus 142 aircraft delivered by Airbus 
in the three-month period.

Ryanair tightens 2022 guidance
Ryanair tightens 2022 guidance

Ryanair has updated its fiscal-year 2022 financial guidance forecasting a pre-exceptional net loss in the range of 
(EURO)350 million ($387 million) to (EURO)400 million for the 12 months ended 31 March, versus a previously 
guided loss of (EURO)250 million to (EURO)450 million.
The European airline group said its full-year traffic recovered "strongly" to over 97 million passengers during the 12-
month period, up from 27.5 million in the same period in 2021, but below pre-Covid traffic of 149 million.
The carrier reported that load factor recovered to 87% in March 2022, up from 77% in the same month in 2021 and 
86% in February 2022.
Ryanair has increased its fiscal-year 2023 fuel hedging to 80% cover of fuel consumption, including around 65% jet 
swaps at $630 per metric tonne and 15% caps at $775. Almost 10% of Ryanair's first-half 2024 fuel requirements 
are hedged at $760 via jet swaps.

 Shares ofRyanair HoldingsRYAAY[1] have been displaying a downtrend on the bourses for a while now, declining 
24.3% in a year's time, better than itsindustry[2]'s 28.6% fall. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Let's delve into the reasons for this unimpressive price performance and examine if the stock's fortunes will rise 
going forward. 
Despite improvement, air-travel demand in the European Union continues to be below the pre-pandemic levels. The 
carrier's February traffic of 8.7 million, though well above the year-ago levels, was below the comparable figure of 
2019. The spike in coronavirus cases in Europe due to the omicron variant contributed to this weakness. 
Per Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, net loss at RYAAY for fiscal 2022 (ended Mar 31) is likely to be in the middle of 
the forecast range of €250-€450 million[3]. Moreover, RYAAY's operating expenses are escalating, primarily due to 
increase in fuel and oil costs, and airport and handling charges. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, the carrier's 
operating expenses surged 87% year over year to €3,792 million. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[4]. 
With oil prices surging, operating expenses will continue to be steep. This is likely to dent bottom-line growth at 
RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, on a brighter note, O'Leary believes, RYAAY's 
performance might be better in fiscal 2023. This, however, depends on the pickup in air traffic and air fares. The 
CEO believes that pre-pandemic profits of 1.5 billion euros might be achieved in fiscal 2023. He was quoted saying: 
"There's a chance but it all depends on pricing'. 
However, following the resurgence of new coronavirus cases recently in some parts of the world, investors will now 
wait and see if this spreads to Europe and hurts Ryanair's improving traffic scenario. Disruptions due to the Russia-
Ukraine war may also affect the air-traffic pickup. 
Some better-ranked stocks within the broaderTransportation[5]sector are as follows: 
USA TruckUSAK[6] currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). USAK's earnings surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (in line in one), the average surprise being 64.4%. 
Shares of USA Truck have rallied more than 35% in the past six months. Improving freight conditions are aiding 
USAK. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Stock Down 24.3% in a Year's Time: Here's Why
GATX CorporationGATX[7] currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GATX has an impressive surprise history, with 
its earnings having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average 
being 27.7%. 
Shares of GATX have also appreciated more than 33% in the past six months. Efforts to reward its shareholders 
through dividends and buybacks are very encouraging.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) is to base two aircraft at its new base at Newcastle, GB in northeast England this summer, 
from where it will operate 19 routes, including ten new ones, the airline announced.
In a statement, the Irish budget carrier said it would operate more than 130 weekly flights in Summer 2022 - 40 
more than in 2019 - representing its largest-ever schedule from Newcastle.
The ten new routes include Chania (Greece), Fuerteventura, Ibiza, Menorca, Las Palmas (Spain); Kraków (Poland), 
Milan Malpensa (Italy), Paphos (Cyprus), Riga (Latvia), and Zadar (Croatia).
"The opening of this base and introduction of these new routes from Newcastle reinforces our commitment to 
increasing connectivity, travel options, and inbound tourism to the area as Ryanair will now offer 40% more capacity 
than it did pre-pandemic," said Marketing Director Dara Brady.
Newcastle International Airport's Chief Executive Officer Nick Jones said Ryanair's move would benefit the wider 
North East in creating hundreds of new jobs and providing an even bigger choice of destinations". The placement of 
the two aircraft will add 60 jobs, an investment of USD200 million, Ryanair said.

Mar 31, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said Thursday he expected a strong rebound in the airline's activity but 
said the recovery was fragile due to Covid and the geopolitical situation. 
O'Leary also told AFP he believed the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded for 20 months following two fatal 
accidents, was "reestablishing its credibility". 
The 737 MAX jetliner has been gradually returning to service since the end of 2020 following a crash in Indonesia in 
2018 and another in Ethiopia five months later that together killed 346 people. 
Speaking on the sidelines of an Airlines for Europe meeting in Brussels, O'Leary said the Ukraine war and soaring 
oil prices over supply fears posed a risk after several months of passenger numbers being hit by the pandemic. 
"We were coming strong in February and then the Ukraine invasion has cost us probably a million passengers in 
February and March as well," he told AFP in an interview. 
"So are we confident? No. But if there are no further significant disruptions, either Covid or Ukraine related, then I 
think there will be a very strong recovery, we could well get to 165 million passengers," he said. 
 O'Leary told AFP he believed the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded for 20 months following two fatal 
accidents, was 'reestablishing its credibility' Photo: AFP / JUSTIN TALLIS  
He said that the airline, which flies mainly throughout Europe and to north Africa, had 65 737 MAX aircraft, which 
use 40 percent less kerosene. 
O'Leary said travellers had reacted well to 55 of those planes now being back in operation. 
"We thought there would be some customers hesitant to flying on a Boeing MAX. So we put up procedures. If you 
don't want to fly on the MAX, you can fly on the next available aircraft," he said. 
But "not one passenger in six months" had done so. 
He said that instead, passengers had welcomed more leg room, a "much quieter flying experience on board the 
aircraft". 
"The MAX is re-establishing its credibility after the two-year hiatus after the Ethiopian and the Indonesian 
accidents," he said. 
It "has now accomplished over a million flights in North America and Europe, and safety has gone away as an issue 
for the MAX aircraft", he said.

Ryanair chief expects 'strong recovery', Covid and Ukraine permitting

 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said Thursday he expected a strong rebound in the airline's activity but 
said the recovery was fragile due to Covid and the geopolitical situation. 
O'Leary also told AFP he believed the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded for 20 months following two fatal 
accidents, was 'reestablishing its credibility'. 
The 737 MAX jetliner has been gradually returning to service since the end of 2020 following a crash in Indonesia in 
2018 and another in Ethiopia five months later that together killed 346 people. 
Speaking on the sidelines of an Airlines for Europe meeting in Brussels, O'Leary said the Ukraine war and soaring 
oil prices over supply fears posed a risk after several months of passenger numbers being hit by the pandemic. 
'We were coming strong in February and then the Ukraine invasion has cost us probably a million passengers in 
February and March as well,' he told AFP in an interview. 
'So are we confident? No. But if there are no further significant disruptions, either Covid or Ukraine related, then I 
think there will be a very strong recovery, we could well get to 165 million passengers,' he said. 
He said that the airline, which flies mainly throughout Europe and to north Africa, had 65 737 MAX aircraft, which 
use 40 percent less kerosene. 
O'Leary said travellers had reacted well to 55 of those planes now being back in operation. 
'We thought there would be some customers hesitant to flying on a Boeing MAX. So we put up procedures. If you 
don't want to fly on the MAX, you can fly on the next available aircraft,' he said. 
But 'not one passenger in six months' had done so. 
He said that instead, passengers had welcomed more leg room, a 'much quieter flying experience on board the 
aircraft'. 
'The MAX is re-establishing its credibility after the two-year hiatus after the Ethiopian and the Indonesian accidents,' 
he said. 
It 'has now accomplished over a million flights in North America and Europe, and safety has gone away as an issue 
for the MAX aircraft', he said.

Ryanair expects its loss for the just-ending financial year at around the middle of its forecasted range and is well 
placed for next year depending on traffic recovery and fares, its chief executive said on Thursday.
Asked on the sidelines of an A4E airlines conference about Ryanair's loss forecast of 250-450 million euros for the 
year to March 31, CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters: "we think we'll be somewhere in the middle of that range".
Asked whether the year to end-March 2023 could see a return to pre-pandemic profits around 1.5 billion euros, he 
said: "There's a chance but it all depends on pricing. I mean, certainly our costs are reasonably robust for the next 
12 months." reuters.com

Airlines 4 Europe: liberalization can optimize air traffic management

 If the countries in the European Unie are unable to implement efficiency improvements in air traffic management 
with the Single European Sky (SES) program, then the alternative should be that air traffic management is 
liberalized. It's then up to competition between air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to improve the situation. 
This was one of the main topics at the Airlines 4 Europe[1] (A4E) Aviation Summit in Brussels on March 31. Airlines 
4 Europe: liberalization can optimize air traffic management. 
It was with some hesitation and embarrassment that Managing Director Thomas Reynaert raised the subject of the 
Single European Sky again. Making better use of air traffic management can optimize routes and reduce carbon 
emissions by at least ten percent, all stakeholders in the project agree. But SES has been on the table since its 
invention in 1999 and 23 years later is still waiting to be introduced, although experiments under the SESAR 
program are currently being tested. 
A4E hasraised the subject[2] at each of its Aviation Summits since the lobby group was formed in 2017. Reynaert 
and airline bosses like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, Lufthansa's Carsten Spohr, easyjet's Johan Lundgren, and IAG's 
Luis Gallego had to confess that the lobby hasn't been successful. O'Leary, who has voiced their opinion and 
frustrations on behalf of A4E before, blamed the lack of progress on individual countries. 'Which ones?', moderator 
Richard Quest wanted to know at a later panel session. 'France, Germany, but others too', the Irish airline boss 
replied. He thinks that ATM improvements and the use of new-technology aircraft can reduce emissions by even 32 
percent, as Ryanair outlines in its recent sustainability roadmap until 2050. 
Even Transport Commissioner is amazed by the lack of progress 
Interestingly, even European Transport Commissioner, Adina Valea, confessed she is surprised by the lack of 
progress made with SES. 'When I entered office, SES was the first file I concentrated on and put forward because it 
makes so much sense. Indeed, I am still amazed that the transport ministers of the EU countries don't recognize 
that.' She too blamed individual countries for the situation.  
Carsten Spohr criticized politicians for failing to act: 'Those who ask us to do more (about the environment) are the 
same who fail to do anything to get us those ten percent in emission savings.' The result is that the aviation industry 
is consistently being criticized for being the biggest polluter. O'Leary thinks the industry hasn't robustly enough 
communicated what it is doing, like investing billions in fleet renewal or pushing for more sustainable aviation fuels 
Airlines 4 Europe: liberalization can optimize air traffic management
(SAF). He also blames France, which as the current president of the European Council hasn't done anything to 
move forward with the Single European Sky.  
With no immediate solution in sight, A4E thinks a different approach is needed: 'For twenty years we have made no 
progress whatsoever on the Single European Sky. Our passengers, our business, our people are entitled to expect 
efficient airspace. Ninety percent of the delays in the past twelve months were caused by air traffic control', said 
O'Leary. 'We cannot, with record-high fuel prices, continue to waste fuel as a result from this fragmented ATM. We 
need Single European Sky and we need European governments to deliver.' 'If we can't have the SES, then let's 
liberalize air traffic management. Let's allow national ATC providers to compete against each other to provide more 
efficient services at lower prices,' O'Leary said. 
Reynaert blames the lack of progress on the very strong positions that unions have in some countries. 'If you want 
to digitalize, which is crucial in this sector, you are instantly meeting opposition. People are afraid to change. It's a 
lack of political willingness.' He thinks that changing the system to a cross-border ATC will result in more 
efficiencies.' Eurocontrol could have a role in this. 
Protection against strikes 
A4E also calls for the protection against national ATC strikes. Too often, controllers in notably France and Italy are 
calling out strikes that hurt international overflights. 'The French, cleverly, use national legislation to protect 
domestic flights but it are all the overflights that take the cancelations and delays. If we have a truly single market, 
Europe can and must these overflights', O'Leary said on behalf of A4E. 'When the French want to go on strike, let 
the French bear the consequences. But we shouldn't delay flights from Italy to Ireland or from Scandinavia to Spain 
simply because the French are on strike.' 
Like IATA before, A4E also opposed the initiative by ANSPs to pass the €5.4 billion bill for missed revenues in 2020 
and 2021 due to fewer flights during the pandemic on to airlines, who pass it on to their passengers. 'We shouldn't 
be obliged to pay for services that we didn't use', said Michael O'Leary. As government-owned organizations, the 
service providers should refer to their states for bailouts and financial aid. IATA Director General Willie Walsh said 
last year that ANSPs should either be helped by government-backed loans or seek commercial loans on the 
market. 
An interview with Thomas Reynaert on thefailed lobby[3] for the Single European Sky and the proposal for 
liberalization will follow later.

Airline investors suffer low visibility with ESG

B eing a green investor in the airline industry isn't easy. But for UK shareholders it's become much harder.
Some investors on the environmental, social and governance spectrum might not be willing to consider airlines at 
all. Pre-pandemic, the industry is estimated to have accounted for about 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions, 
with a larger effect still on global warming.
But asset managers have moved past a policy of blanket divestment to one of engagement, attempting to influence 
companies' actions so they are more ESG-friendly. It's hard to engage - or more to the point, influence - if you don't 
have a say, though. And UK investors in EU airlines increasingly don't.
Airlines including Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air have moved to disenfranchise UK shareholders, stripping the 
voting rights from their shares over the past 18 months. This is thanks to Brexit, which means UK investors no 
longer count towards the requirement in the licences airlines need to fly between EU destinations that they are 
"majority owned and controlled" within the bloc.
A legal quirk means that removing votes from shares satisfies both ownership and control requirements. In 1995 the 
European Commission decided in a case involving Swissair and Belgium's national airline Sabena that shares 
counted only if they had, broadly, both rights to dividends and to vote.
There is some debate about this: HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg thinks further action will be needed, citing 
moves by Ryanair to force non-EU investors to sell any shares they buy. But easyJet and Wizz seem to see the 
Airline investors suffer low visibility with ESG
voting ploy as removing a headache that might otherwise require them to carry out complex restructurings (British 
Airways owner IAG, which hasn't disenfranchised anyone, has insisted its intricate corporate structure meets all the 
rules already).
Analysts assumed the issue would be ironed out between the UK and EU but it hasn't and they are still waiting.
That means each airline has come up with its own solution. At easyJet, it's "last in first out": votes are removed from 
the newest non-EU shareholders up to the point that EU shareholders control a majority. At Wizz, every investor 
can at least vote some of its shares. Ryanair has the most stringent approach: no UK shareholder is able to vote 
any of their shares, and non-EU investors are blocked from buying its ordinary shares.
The effects are not small. When easyJet held its annual meeting in February, the first since it changed its rules, 
about 30 per cent of its non-EU shareholder base had to be disenfranchised to create an EU voting majority. At 
Wizz, each UK shareholder stands to lose more than 85 per cent of their votes based on ownership figures last 
year.
That has made a mockery of meeting turnout figures and hands disproportionate influence to the EU holders who 
can still vote. At Ryanair, turnout fell from 69 per cent in 2020 to 9 per cent when the rules were implemented last 
year. At easyJet, it went from 68 per cent to 36 per cent. At Wizz, 93 per cent of shareholders cast a vote at a 
meeting earlier this year. Only 14 per cent actually counted.
Such disenfranchisement should be concerning when investors are being asked to vote on proposals such as the 
Wizz chief executive's £100mn pay plan, approved last year on less than 16 per cent turnout. In 2020, when UK 
shareholders could vote and turnout was above 80 per cent, investors rejected Wizz's remuneration report.
The airlines insist that they engage with all shareholders regardless of their voting status. They have been pursuing 
more climate-friendly policies such as switching to more efficient aircraft.
But surely the influence of a shareholder reduces if management knows they have been neutered. That should 
concern ESG investors who believe investing in aviation stocks can be justified on the basis that engaging with 
management enables them to secure more favourable policies.
Until the rules are changed, ESG investors in airlines have a choice: divest or accept their investment can make 
less of a difference than it should. cat.rutterpooley@ft.com

Renault's attempt to resume car production in Russia stalls
Renault's attempt to resume car production in Russia stalls

ON MARCH 21, it was reported that Renault would resume production in Russia in the midst of its ongoing conflict 
with Ukraine. The move was followed a couple of days later by a hasty reversal, but data from YouGov BrandIndex 
shows that, in the short term at least, the controversy has done damage to the automaker.
Buzz scores, which track whether consumers have heard something positive or negative about a company in the 
past two weeks, indicate that the story has cut through with the public - falling from 1.4 to -3.6 between 20 - 27 
March (-5). This influenced general opinion of the brand: Impression scores, a measure of positive and negative 
sentiment, declined from 12.2 to 6.1 (-6.1) in the same period.
Resuming manufacturing in Russia (however temporarily) had a severe impact on public perceptions of the 
carmaker's quality, with scores tracking this metric plunging from 7.2 to -2.2 (- 9.4). The reverse-ferret also failed to 
put the brakes on Renault's dwindling Reputation scores - a metric that tracks whether someone would be proud or 
embarrassed to work for a brand, and one that declined from 6.4 to 2.3 (-4.1). Recommendation scores also 
slumped from 5.7 to -0.8: a deterioration of 6.5 points.
Finally, the public are less willing to consider Renault than they were before: scores measuring whether consumers 
would think about purchasing from a brand when given a list of options tracked downwards from 13.2 to 9.0 (-4.2) 
between 20 and 27 March.
Renault was reportedly reluctant to halt production in Russia over the expense associated with leaving the invading 
country - but as other brands such as Ryanair (which recently rejected claims that it hiked fares for
Ukrainian refugees) can attest, the perception that you're on the wrong side of this conflict can have costs of its own 
for brands.

Belarus puts activist's girlfriend on trial after dramatic arrest
Belarus puts activist's girlfriend on trial after dramatic arrest

Mar 28, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Russian girlfriend of Belarusian dissident Roman Protasevich[1] has gone on trial in Minsk, months after their 
plane was forced to land[2] in the Belarusian capital, according to Belarusian media. 
Sofia Sapega, 24, was detained with Protasevich, 26, in May last year when their Ryanair flight from Greece to 
Lithuania was grounded as it passed over Belarus. The news led tointernational condemnation[3], with some 
European leaders calling the move a 'hijacking'. 
A court in Belarus on Monday started a closed-door trial against Sapega, who faces seven criminal charges, 
including 'inciting social hatred' and 'violence or threats' against police, opposition media outlet Zerkalo said. 
Sapega faces up to six years in jail. 
After her arrest, Sapega cooperated with authorities and appealed to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko 
for her release. 
Sapega poses for a picture in Gothenburg, Sweden [File: Stringer/Reuters] 
Protasevich fled to Poland in 2019 from where co-founded and edited the Poland-based online news service, 
Nexta, which broadcast footage of the mass protests via the Telegram messenger app. 
With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta played a key role in 
steering and coordinating protesters in 2020[4], when internet access was often blocked and independent media 
were heavily restricted. 
After their arrests, both Protasevich and Sapega appeared in 'confession' videos[5] that their supporters said were 
recorded under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
Protasevich remains under house arrest[6] in Belarus awaiting trial. He faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted. 
In response to Protasevich and Sapega's arrests, which led to international outrage, Brussels last year banned 
Belarusian state carrier Belavia from operating flights to airports in the European Union and discouraged EU-based 
airlines from flying over Belarus. 
The EU and the United States have imposed waves of sanctions on Lukashenko and his allies over the crackdown 
on the protests that saw thousands arrested and reports of police brutality[7]. 
The US, EU, United Kingdom and Canada have joined forces to impose sweeping sanctions[8]on several top 
Belarusian officials. 
The EU has also imposed a series of bruising economic sanctions[9] that target key Belarus exports, including 
potash - a common fertiliser ingredient - and petroleum products.

April), and Warsaw Modlin (1 May); SunExpress commencing Izmir (18 June); and Wizz Air starting Chisinau (28

Online estate agent Purple Bricks has struggled to get its house in order, having abandoned an international 
extension and got into a legal dispute with "contractors". So even while the housing market boomed, it did not.
Yet given that the housing market is showing continued strength - average annual house price growth rose to 12.6 
per cent in February, according to Nationwide building society - there are clearly some who think that there is 
money to be made in Purplebricks' restoration.
JNE Partners, a spin-out from a vehicle set up to manage Dell Technologies' founder Michael Dell's wealth, this 
month increased its stake in the company from 7 per cent to nearer 11 per cent.
Directors are also showing faith. Non-executives Simon Downing and Elona Mortimer-Zhika, and the wife of 
chairman Paul Pindar, spent more than £330,000 on shares between March 11 and 15, filings show. Michael Fahy,

Bratislava Airport: 80% of pre-Covid network is back in S22

Bratislava Airport´s summer network is almost back to its pre-Covid normal. 70% of scheduled destinations will be 
the same as 2019, and with 6 new additions replacing some of the discontinued routes, the scheduled network will 
stand at 80% of 2019.
The desire of Slovak holiday makers to return to their favourite hot spots is sounded by both the tour operators as 
well as local travel agents, who confirm that first moment bookings went beyond expectations. Most of the airlines 
have returned with their former travel programs to Bratislava. Thanks to that, some 35 scheduled and 30 charter 
destinations will be available from the Slovak capital this summer.
Among the top novelties, new routes to Zagreb, Dalaman and Trapani will be launched in the last week of March. 
Lanzarote and Copenhagen, that were introduced by Ryanair at the end of 2021, will also serve their first summer 
season from Bratislava. It is still hoped, that Ukrainian airline Sky Up will be able to launch the planned route 
between BTS and Charkiv at some point this summer season.
UK, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands in western Europe, as well as Italy, Spain, Croatia, Bulgaria, North Macedonia 
and Greece will all be connected with the Slovak capital by numerous scheduled routes. Underpinned by the ever-
popular spots in Turkey, Egypt and UAE, the offer reflects the preferences of Slovak consumers.
Up to 30 more seasonal charter routes will complement the scheduled network, connecting the most favourite 
destinations in the Mediterranean and Africa.
Bratislava Airport handled slightly above 480-thousand passengers in 2021, which stands for only about 20% of the 
pre-Covid volumes. It was not possible to serve scheduled flights due to imposed restrictions for almost 6 months 
during the previous year. And while the pandemic situation in Slovakia improved significantly since the end of 
February 2022, the airport remains cautious with its expectations for 2022, namely on the incoming side. Big part of 
the former network was oriented on Ukraine and Russia, with 7 existing or planned routes being affected by the 
running conflict, a gap that will be hard to fill in short term.
During the month of March, the airport handled repatriation flights including ones to China or Morocco, for citizens 
returning to their homelands from Ukraine. Humanitarian and special cargo flights are also served on regular basis. 
The airport also plays a role of a transfer point for Ukrainian refugees arriving by road and continuing to other 
countries of Europe in the BTS network.

During the summer season of 2022 starting on 27 March, along with transition to summertime, Riga Airport will offer 
connections to more than 100 direct regular and charter destinations.
As of 31 March, a new airline - the Dutch low-cost airline Transavia Airlines C.V. - will launch its operations at Riga 
Airport. The airline will operate three flights a week on the Riga - Amsterdam route, thus ensuring even better 
connections between the Baltic States and one of the busiest transit airports in Europe.
Airlines will also offer new routes to passengers in the summer season. The national airline airBaltic will launch 
flights from Riga to Batumi in Georgia in May, while the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will add two new destinations 
to its range of destinations: Riga - Växjö (Sweden) from 28 March and Riga - Newcastle (United Kingdom) from 1 
April.
After a break of more than two years, airBaltic will resume flights to Malta at the end of April, while the Spanish city 
of Girona will return to the Ryanair flight schedule.
The planned total number of flights is steadily increasing as the spring approaches, and especially from next week, 
which will be the first full week of the summer season. Around 940 flights are planned at Riga Airport next week, 
which is a quarter more than this week. At the end of April, the forecast for scheduled and charter passenger flights 
already exceeds 1 000 flights per week.

Ryanair 's plan for carbon neutrality by 2050 will boost its image with travellers
Ryanair's plan for carbon neutrality by 2050 will boost its image with 
travellers

Highlight: Ryanair has set a target to become carbon neutral by 2050, as part of its new Pathway to Net Zero 
decarbonisation strategy. This will be a boost to Ryanair's image if the target is reached, because there is growing 
demand for ESG transparency and concrete actions. In GlobalData's 2021 Q3 consumer survey, 19% of 
respondents took eco-holidays, which shows that an increasing number of travellers are conscious about their 
impact on the environment. This means that a move by Ryanair to reduce its carbon footprint is likely to gain 
positive feedback from the public.
Body
The airline industry can use ESG solutions to improve how it is viewedIt is no secret that airlines struggle with a 
negative ESG image because of the inherent nature of the industry, so this makes working at neutrality, and then 
promoting what is being done, is very important for companies. However, the initiative set out by Ryanair shows a 
clear plan to reduce its carbon footprint to be neutral by 2050. The low-cost carrier plans to achieve 34% of its 
decarbonisation by switching to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and 32% by making technological and operational 
improvements. 
It also intends to to achieve another 24% of its decarbonisation aims through offsetting and other economic 
measures, as well as the last 10% through improved air traffic management activities. Following through on 
promises will be of paramount importancePlans like this have the effect of boosting the public image of a company, 
however, this means that the need for them to follow through on promises/plans becomes most important, 
otherwise it risks damaging the company's public image. This is because consumers can see through false or 
empty promises. Under its Pathway to Net Zero strategy, Ryanair will also focus on offsetting measures through 
carbon capture offset projects and support for key government policies and reforms, including the Single European 
Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative. SESAR is estimated to deliver an efficient air traffic management process 
and could lead to a 10% carbon reduction in the European aviation sector, if it is successfully launched by the 
European Commission. Therefore, prominent European airlines, such as Ryanair, showing support will be welcome.

Highlight: Ryanair has announced a target to become carbon neutral by 2050. The aviation industry is currently 
responsible for 2% of human-made carbon emissions, and airlines must confront daunting challenges to achieve 
their net-zero goals.
Body
Ryanair is pinning its decarbonisation hopes on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF can help, but it is not yet clear 
how much it can help. Ryanair intends to reduce 34% of its carbon by switching to SAF. The remaining reductions 
will come through technical and operational changes (32%), offsetting and economic measures (24%), and 
improved air traffic management (10%). What is SAF?
SAF, also referred to as alternative jet fuel or renewable aviation fuel, is a promising option for airlines seeking to 
reduce their carbon footprint. Where conventional aviation fuel is derived from hydrocarbons, SAF is derived from 
renewable sources, such as municipal solid waste, cellulosic waste, used cooking oil, and camelina. SAF can 
reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, compared to conventional jet fuel. Additionally, SAF is purer; it produces 
far less sulphur dioxide, and fewer particulates. ASTM International, the relevant regulatory body, has approved 
multiple technologies for SAF production. These include Fischer-Tropsch, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids 
(HEFA-SPK), Hydroprocessed Fermented Sugars to Synthetic Isoparaffins (HFS-SIP), and Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic 
Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK). Often, SAF is blended with conventional fuel to make it suitable for aircraft use. Is 
SAF the answer?Financially, there are both upsides and downsides to SAF. First and foremost, SAF is much more 
expensive to produce than jet fuel. The production process is more involved, and the supply chain is less mature. 
However, SAF can be cheaper too. As the source of feedstock is not limited to a particular production, refining, and 
storage location, local smaller-scale supply chains can be established to supply fuel to airlines. Additionally, SAF 
costs are more dependable than volatile hydrocarbon prices, which means smaller error margins can be used, 
which brings down costs. It is reasonable to conclude that SAF has the potential to replace conventional aviation 
fuel and significantly reduce the aviation sector's emissions. Some oil refineries are switching to renewable fuel, or 
co-processing it, and new renewable fuel plants are being developed, such as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. 
Given the benefits SAF promises for both companies and governments, facilitating the transition to SAF may prove 
Ryanair aims for 2050 carbon neutrality via sustainable aviation fuels
to be a lucrative long-term option for incumbent hydrocarbon companies. As more countries institute initiatives and 
regulations to encourage decarbonisation, SAF will become an increasingly attractive option.

RYANAIR came under fire last week following accusations that the budget airline was hiking fares for refugees 
looking to leave war-torn Ukraine. The claims, levied at an Irish parliamentary committee meeting last week, have 
been firmly rejected by the company.
Nevertheless, data from YouGov BrandIndex UK shows that, between March 15 (the day before the claim was 
made in the Irish Parliament) and March 20, the allegations have further battered Ryanair's (already negative) 
public image. Impression scores, which measure overall positive and negative sentiment, nosedived from -26.7 to -
38.3 - a fall of 11.6 points - while the brand's ailing
Reputation scores (a measure of whether consumers would be proud or embarrassed to work for a company) sank 
even lower from -27.1 to -36.2 (-9.1).
Value for Money scores - important to Ryanair as a low-cost airline, and among the few metrics that were in positive 
territory - took an immediate hit, plunging from 9.4 to -8.5 (-17.9), and Recommendations declined from -27.1 to -
36.2 (-9.1). Given the immediate blowback, it's perhaps not altogether surprising that CEO Michael O'Leary has 
emphatically described claims that Ryanair upped prices for refugee flights as "completely false".
Whatever the reality, it's the kind of PR storm that might prompt some reflection from a brand that has regularly 
been in the media for the wrong reasons.
With Index scores - a measure of overall brand health - moving from bad (- 17.8) to worse (-26.5) over the five-day 
period (-8.7), the public may now be willing to believe negative headlines about Ryanair regardless of whether they 
are true or not.

covering if the policy was no longer in place at both ends of the www.route.UK domestic flights as well as routes 
between Britain and Denmark, Gibraltar, Hungary and Iceland follow under the new policy.

Mar 23, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1] increased its fuel cost per gallon view for first-quarter 2022 
due to the recent upsurge in oil price. By doing so, ALGT joined a host of other airlines that took similar actions, as 
reported in the previous week's write up[2]. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[3] was another primary news maker in the past week, courtesy of its environmentally-friendly 
deal with the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) maker Gevo. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] was also in news for its eco-
friendly stance as it aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. RYAAY intends to achieve one-third of its 
decarbonization target through the use of sustainable jet fuels. An expansion-related update has also been 
available from Spirit Airlines SAVE[5] in the past week. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. Delta signed a 'take-or-
pay' agreement with Gevo for 75 million gallons of SAF per year for a seven-year term. The agreement replaces 
Delta's existing deal with Gevo, signed in 2019, to purchase 10 million gallons of SAF per year. It advances DAL's 
goal of achieving net-zero aviation. DAL has a target to replace 10% of its conventional jet fuel consumption with 
SAF by the end of 2030.  
2. In line with its objective to use more SAF, Ryanair is trying to accelerate the supply of SAF by working with the 
European Union and fuel suppliers. RYAAY anticipates 32% of the decarbonization to happen via technological and 
operational improvements. RYAAY intends to continue investing in new technology and aircraft. 
Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects to reduce emissions by offsetting measures. Carbon-
capture offset projects plus government policies and reforms, such as the introduction of the Single European Sky 
ATM Research (SESAR), are expected to help RYAAY meet 24% of its decarbonation target[6]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
3. Allegiant now expects fuel price per gallon to be $3.05 in the first quarter of 2022 (earlier guidance was $2.67). 
Allegiant lowered its capacity growth forecast for the first quarter due to the oil price rise. Available seat miles (a 
measure of capacity), both for scheduled service and system wide, are expected to increase in the 17-19% range 
from the first-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance was for an increase in the 19-23% range). 
Due to the cut in the capacity growth forecast, ALGT increased the lower limit of its first-quarter 2022 non-fuel unit 
cost growth projection. The metric is now expected to rise in the 3-5% range from the first-quarter 2019 actuals[8] 
(earlier guidance was an increase of 1-5%).

4. In response to the uptick in air-travel demand, Spirit Airlines is widening its network. To this end, SAVE is 
expanding its presence in Las Vegas, NV, with nonstop flights to Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ), Boise 
Airport (BOI) and Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO). Daily nonstop service between Harry Reid International 
Airport in Las Vegas and ABQ is set to begin Aug 3, 2022, onward. The same between Las Vegas and BOI is 
expected to commence Aug 5 onward. The service between Las Vegas and RNO will be operational twice daily 
from Aug 10. Following these new services, Spirit Airlines will operate flights to 41 nonstop destinations and offer up 
to 75 peak-day departures. This indicates a 30% increase in SAVE's service to Las Vegas[9] from the year-ago 
reported figure. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the 
past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the past week. However, the gains 
were muted in nature. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 1.3% to $75.86. Over the past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 23%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Watch this space for the usual

For an aircraft like China Eastern's Boeing 737-800 to crash in midflight is "simply unprecedented," said one 
aviation analyst who cited the plane's excellent safety record.
"Air travel is the safest form of transport. But when we do suffer incidents or accidents, we don't see anything like 
what we have seen in China over the last 24 hours," Alex Macheras, an independent aviation analyst, told CNBC's 
"Capital Connection" on Tuesday.
"This nosedive was simply unprecedented, especially from cruising altitude. We're talking about the safest phase of 
the flight. That's why those answers are going to be needed as soon as possible to determine," he added.
No bodies or survivors have yet been found from the crash as of Tuesday morning, Chinese state media said.
The domestic flight was carrying 132 people when it nose-dived Monday afternoon in the southern region of 
Guangxi.
The plane was cruising at 29,100 feet and began a sharp descent after 2:20 p.m., recovering more than 1,000 feet 
briefly - then continuing to dive again before it lost contact. It fell more than 25,000 feet in about two minutes.
The 737-800 that crashed Monday in China first flew in June 2015. It was not a Boeing 737 Max, the plane that was 
grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. China was one of the first countries to ground the 
737 Max after the second of the two crashes.
Aircraft's safety record
"The aircraft involved was a 6-year-old, so a very young 737-800, which has a stellar safety record all over the 
globe," said Macheras.
"We are talking about an aircraft that makes up the entire fleet of European low-cost airline Ryanair. An airline 
aircraft that is in service with American Airlines, Qantas, FlyDubai, Ethiopian, KLM," he added, saying the plane is 
used to performing in very difficult conditions.
According to travel analytics firm Cirium, there are more than 4,200 Boeing 737-800s in service worldwide and 
1,177 of them are in Chinese airlines' fleets.
China crash is 'unprecedented' given Boeing 737 s stellar safety record
Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered an investigation and rescue teams to the location of the crash in the rural, 
mountainous region.
Sheila Kahyaoglu, aerospace and defense analyst at Jefferies, said the safety record of the aircraft makes it highly 
probable something unusual happened during flight.
"Given the safety record of this aircraft, and the fact that it only had nine fatal accidents in 25 years, I highly doubt 
it's a manufacturer's issue," she told CNBC on Tuesday.
"Obviously it's too early to think about that, or to make that conclusion," Kahyaoglu acknowledged, indicating that 
perhaps "something abnormal happened" since the aircraft has had a good safety record so far.
Search for the 'black box'
As the jet was a U.S.-made plane, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it has appointed an 
investigator for the crash.
Investigators will work to recover so-called black boxes that contain cockpit voice recordings and flight data. They 
are also likely to examine the aircraft's previous flights, maintenance history, weather data and pilot health.
Macheras said it's the black box that is going to "ultimately push investigators into the right direction, in that quest 
for answers."
"As the nature of the crash remains completely unexplained, what role the aircraft was playing will be the question 
on so many regulators' [minds] worldwide," he said. "There is always that risk and that's why investigators will be 
wanting to rule out whatever they can. But as we say, the black box is what's going to contain the most impact."

For an aircraft like China Eastern's Boeing 737-800 to crash in midflight is "simply unprecedented," said one 
aviation analyst who cited the plane's excellent safety record.
"Air travel is the safest form of transport. But when we do suffer incidents or accidents, we don't see anything like 
what we have seen in China over the last 24 hours," Alex Macheras, an independent aviation analyst, told CNBC's 
"Capital Connection" on Tuesday.
"This nosedive was simply unprecedented, especially from cruising altitude. We're talking about the safest phase of 
the flight. That's why those answers are going to be needed as soon as possible to determine," he added.
No bodies or survivors have yet been found from the crash as of Tuesday morning, Chinese state media said.
The domestic flight was carrying 132 people when it nose-dived Monday afternoon in the southern region of 
Guangxi.
The plane was cruising at 29,100 feet and began a sharp descent after 2:20 p.m., recovering more than 1,000 feet 
briefly - then continuing to dive again before it lost contact. It fell more than 25,000 feet in about two minutes.

Ryanair to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050
Ryanair to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050

Highlight: Ryanair has set a target to become carbon neutral by 2050 as part of its new Pathway to Net Zero 
decarbonisation strategy.
Body
The Irish low-cost carrier plans to achieve 34% of decarbonisation by switching to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) 
and 32% by making technological and operational improvements. The company said that it is currently working with 
SAF suppliers and the European Union to increase the procurement of SAF. 
As part of its initiative, the airline company has also partnered with Trinity College Dublin to establish a Ryanair 
Sustainable Aviation Research Centre. Under the partnership, the two organisations will focus on SAF research and 
the development of Zero Carbon Aircraft Propulsion Systems and Noise Mapping. Ryanair said it will invest in new 
technology and aircraft. It has also committed to acquiring 210 Boeing 737-8200 'Gamechanger' aircraft with an 
investment of $22bn. The Irish carrier intends to achieve another 24% of its decarbonisation aims through offsetting 
and other economic measures, as well as the last 10% through improved Air Traffic Management activities. Under 
its Pathway to Net Zero strategy, Ryanair will also focus on offsetting measures through carbon capture offset 
projects and support for key government policies and reforms, including the Single European Sky ATM Research 
(SESAR) initiative. SESAR is estimated to deliver an efficient air traffic management process and could lead to a 
10% carbon reduction in the European aviation sector if it is successfully launched by the European Commission. 
Through these initiatives, Ryanair intends to cut carbon emission levels, as well as the impact of its own operations 
on the environment. Ryanair Sustainability director Thomas Fowler said: "As Europe's greenest major airline, 
Ryanair understands that aviation plays a pivotal role in tackling climate change and our Pathway to Net Zero will 
help us do just that."

Three days after the invasion of Ukraine, a Boeing 737 - operated by Russia's Pobeda but owned by Dublinbased 
Avolon - was impounded after landing in Istanbul.
The seizure came as European sanctions on Russia's aviation sector prompted a scramble among overseas 
leasing groups to recover more than 500 aircraft, worth an estimated $10bn, that were stuck in the country.
But it was among the last to be repossessed, after the Kremlin acted to block such efforts last week by signing a 
law allowing foreign jets to be re-registered in Russia.
"The Russian government is playing a game of what I call grand theft aero," said Paul Jebely, global head of asset 
finance at law firm Withers.
Russia's actions could force the largest leasing companies to write off billions of dollars worth of assets, raising the 
prospect of lengthy battles with insurers over who should foot the bill.
Rating agencies have warned that the lost income from the leases has increased risks to bondholders in deals 
backed by the aircraft.
Lessors count cost of Kremlin's grand theft aero Operators seeking to recover assets worth $10bn face losses 
and insurance battles after passage of registration....
Moscow has flouted decades-old international treaties that provided security to lessors operating in riskier 
jurisdictions and helped underpin a boom in international travel.
"This is the worst-case scenario, where a country unilaterally takes control of an aircraft's register," said Phil 
Seymour, president of aviation consultancy IBA. "It has never really been contemplated. There will be 
repercussions in terms of aircraft lease agreements."
Some industry executives have insisted that it is too early to write off the chances of these planes flying 
internationally again. But others believe the chances are slim.
"From a planning perspective, we should assume that those aeroplanes are gone, for all intents and purposes," one 
executive said.
The crisis has sent shockwaves through the aviation finance industry of Ireland, which is home to 14 of the top 15 
lessors, including market leader AerCap.
Irish lessors manage more than (EURO)100bn in assets, 22 per cent of aircraft and more than 40 per cent of those 
that are leased, according to IDA Ireland, the country's investment promotion agency.
The leading position dates back to Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, who propelled Ireland into a leasing powerhouse 
with his Guinness Peat Aviation, which he started in the 1970s with an investment of £5,000.
A failed stock market listing led to the company's downfall and the acquisition of its assets by GE Capital, but it left 
industry experts behind who were ready to compete in the niche leasing market.
GPA's heritage is not the only reason Ireland became a global hub for the industry. Attractive tax and capital 
allowance rates have been a draw. The country's 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate has been one of the lowest in 
Europe, although Ireland has signed up to the OECD reform to lift it to 15 per cent.
The sector's influence in Ireland's economy has increased over the years as other industries such as professional 
services have grown up to support it.
However, despite the size of the industry, companies involved in aircraft leasing paid just (EURO)105.5mn in Irish 
tax in 2020, though additional tax liabilities were deferred.
Irish-owned aircraft leased to Russian airlines are worth more than $4bn, according to estimates by the aviation 
consultancy Cirium.
AerCap is the most exposed, with 152 planes valued at (EURO)2.1bn before the outbreak of the conflict, according 
to IBA data. Japanese-controlled SMBC Aviation Capital has 34 valued at $1.3bn, while Avolon had 14 valued at 
(EURO)320mn when the war broke out.
The three groups declined to comment.
While the crisis may prove a significant hit to the companies' balance sheets, it is not an existential threat.
The lessors' exposures in terms of percentage of the total net book value of their fleets are in the single digits. At 
the end of last year, about 5 per cent of Aer-Cap's fleet by net book value was on lease to Russian airlines.
"It's a big headache, maybe a migraine, but not a fatal one," said Ross Harvey, leasing analyst at Irish stockbrokers 
Davy.
One senior Irish official ruled out any bailout for the sector.
The most immediate question for the lessors will be to ensure that they have terminated all their contracts in Russia 
by next Monday, the deadline imposed under EU sanctions.
Lessors count cost of Kremlin's grand theft aero Operators seeking to recover assets worth $10bn face losses 
and insurance battles after passage of registration....
In the very short term, most will have at least some protection in the form of security deposits, typically three 
months' lease rentals. IBA's Seymour estimates that a carrier will typically have paid about $1mn a month in lease 
rental for a five-year-old Boeing 777.
Wrangles with insurance companies have begun. Some lessors are reviewing whether their aircraft hull insurance 
coverage will help them recover prospective losses, according to one industry consultant.
One expert in aviation finance based in Dublin said he was aware of some lessors already receiving cancellations 
of war risk policies related to the coverage of aircraft. A vital consideration is what is accepted as the trigger for a 
claim.
Steven Udvar-Hazy, chair of America's Air Lease, said the new Russian law showed that Moscow intended to 
"confiscate" planes, adding that this would help lessors in claims with insurers.
"I think it helps the insurance question because it demonstrates the intent to confiscate which is, I think, a critical 
aspect of our war-risk insurance," he told a JPMorgan conference last week.
Jebely, who is also chair of an international arbitration court for aviation set to launch in May, said Russia had 
painted itself as a "target for aircraft lessors and others to use investment treaty rights" to pursue "investorstate" 
arbitration claims in international tribunals.
One senior leasing industry executive tried to strike a more sanguine tone, noting that "the war will be over at some 
stage. Russia has about 700 aircraft and the bulk are western-manufactured. The reality is, a deal will have to be 
done ... People have to be practical."
Longer term, there are concerns that the problem might also arise elsewhere.
"We spent decades trying to open up the Russian market to western finance and technology," said one industry 
veteran.
"If this could happen in Russia, then could it happen in China? "Russia is a market that the aviation industry can 
afford to lose in terms of a leasing and financing perspective. China is not."

Three days after the invasion of Ukraine, a Boeing 737 - operated by Russia's Pobeda but owned by Dublinbased 
Avolon - was impounded after landing in Istanbul.
The seizure came as European sanctions on Russia's aviation sector prompted a scramble among overseas 
leasing groups to recover more than 500 aircraft, worth an estimated $10bn, that were stuck in the country.
But it was among the last to be repossessed, after the Kremlin acted to block such efforts last week by signing a 
law allowing foreign jets to be re-registered in Russia.
"The Russian government is playing a game of what I call grand theft aero," said Paul Jebely, global head of asset 
finance at law firm Withers.
Russia's actions could force the largest leasing companies to write off billions of dollars worth of assets, raising the 
prospect of lengthy battles with insurers over who should foot the bill.
Rating agencies have warned that the lost income from the leases has increased risks to bondholders in deals 
backed by the aircraft.
Lessors count cost of Kremlin's grand theft aero Operators seeking to recover assets worth $10bn face losses 
and insurance battles after passage of registration....
Moscow has flouted decades-old international treaties that provided security to lessors operating in riskier 
jurisdictions and helped underpin a boom in international travel.
"This is the worst-case scenario, where a country unilaterally takes control of an aircraft's register," said Phil 
Seymour, president of aviation consultancy IBA. "It has never really been contemplated. There will be 
repercussions in terms of aircraft lease agreements."
Some industry executives have insisted that it is too early to write off the chances of these planes flying 
internationally again. But others believe the chances are slim.
"From a planning perspective, we should assume that those aeroplanes are gone, for all intents and purposes," one 
executive said.
The crisis has sent shockwaves through the aviation finance industry of Ireland, which is home to 14 of the top 15 
lessors, including market leader AerCap.
Irish lessors manage more than (EURO)100bn in assets, 22 per cent of aircraft and more than 40 per cent of those 
that are leased, according to IDA Ireland, the country's investment promotion agency.
The leading position dates back to Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, who propelled Ireland into a leasing powerhouse 
with his Guinness Peat Aviation, which he started in the 1970s with an investment of £5,000.
A failed stock market listing led to the company's downfall and the acquisition of its assets by GE Capital, but it left 
industry experts behind who were ready to compete in the niche leasing market.
GPA's heritage is not the only reason Ireland became a global hub for the industry. Attractive tax and capital 
allowance rates have been a draw. The country's 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate has been one of the lowest in 
Europe, although Ireland has signed up to the OECD reform to lift it to 15 per cent.
The sector's influence in Ireland's economy has increased over the years as other industries such as professional 
services have grown up to support it.
However, despite the size of the industry, companies involved in aircraft leasing paid just (EURO)105.5mn in Irish 
tax in 2020, though additional tax liabilities were deferred.
Irish-owned aircraft leased to Russian airlines are worth more than $4bn, according to estimates by the aviation 
consultancy Cirium.
AerCap is the most exposed, with 152 planes valued at (EURO)2.1bn before the outbreak of the conflict, according 
to IBA data. Japanese-controlled SMBC Aviation Capital has 34 valued at $1.3bn, while Avolon had 14 valued at 
(EURO)320mn when the war broke out.
The three groups declined to comment.
While the crisis may prove a significant hit to the companies' balance sheets, it is not an existential threat.
The lessors' exposures in terms of percentage of the total net book value of their fleets are in the single digits. At 
the end of last year, about 5 per cent of Aer- Cap's fleet by net book value was on lease to Russian airlines.
"It's a big headache, maybe a migraine, but not a fatal one," said Ross Harvey, leasing analyst at Irish stockbrokers 
Davy.
One senior Irish official ruled out any bailout for the sector.
The most immediate question for the lessors will be to ensure that they have terminated all their contracts in Russia 
by next Monday, the deadline imposed under EU sanctions.
Lessors count cost of Kremlin's grand theft aero Operators seeking to recover assets worth $10bn face losses 
and insurance battles after passage of registration....
In the very short term, most will have at least some protection in the form of security deposits, typically three 
months' lease rentals. IBA's Seymour estimates that a carrier will typically have paid about $1mn a month in lease 
rental for a five-year-old Boeing 777.
Wrangles with insurance companies have begun. Some lessors are reviewing whether their aircraft hull insurance 
coverage will help them recover prospective losses, according to one industry consultant.
One expert in aviation finance based in Dublin said he was aware of some lessors already receiving cancellations 
of war risk policies related to the coverage of aircraft. A vital consideration is what is accepted as the trigger for a 
claim.
Steven Udvar-Hazy, chair of America's Air Lease, said the new Russian law showed that Moscow intended to 
"confiscate" planes, adding that this would help lessors in claims with insurers.
"I think it helps the insurance question because it demonstrates the intent to confiscate which is, I think, a critical 
aspect of our war-risk insurance," he told a JPMorgan conference last week.
Jebely, who is also chair of an international arbitration court for aviation set to launch in May, said Russia had 
painted itself as a "target for aircraft lessors and others to use investment treaty rights" to pursue "investorstate" 
arbitration claims in international tribunals.

IRELAND's transport minister Eamon Ryan yesterday said he would talk to Ryanair after the low-cost airline was 
accused of hiking prices of flights out of Poland.
Larysa Gerasko, Ukraine's ambassador to Ireland, told a Dublin EU committee last week that it was "unfortunate" 
behaviour on the airline's side, especially as Polish airports have become the way out for Ukrainians fleeing the 
horrors of the war. Ryanair has repeatedly denied the accusations.
"Through the previous Covid crisis, on a number of occasions they helped us in terms of getting people out of 
difficult places in different ways," the transport minister said.
"Let me first of all talk to the ambassador and then I'll talk to Ryanair without a doubt."
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said in early March the carrier would maintain low prices to help fleeing 
Ukrainians reconnect with friends and families, City A.M. reported.
"We're keeping our air fares low, we want to play our part as best as we can," O'Leary said.

Will P&O Ferries get cancelled?

Mar 22, 2022( Mark My Words: http://www.markborkowski.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 As the outrage over the P&O scandal reaches the point of inertia, here's my (slightly disheartening) take: We all 
saw the disturbing news of P&O Ferries sacking 800 people with no notice last week and the justifiable outrage it 
caused.We have seen protests from unions on the docks, captains refusing to leave their ships or let new crews (of 
underpaid foreign agency workers) onboard against a backdrop of unified condemnation from media, social 
mediaand across the political spectrum. But will this abhorrent treatment of workers impact P&O Ferries' brand and 
profit?
 Sadly,I suspect not. Time and again we see big businesses bully workers and customers and get away with it. This 
is particularly true where a brand dominates a certain market; condemnation alone is not enough. Are consumers 
likely to wait for the next ferry rather than take a P&O one?Will freight companies endanger their already over-
pressured supply lines?I suspect the answer to both these questions is 'no'. The government seemsreluctant 
toclose these loopholes ('fire and rehire' is one of many) which begs the question; can consumers, media or 
campaigners have a real influence on brand behaviour? We've witnessed Wetherspoons' mass sackings,Amazon's 
mass-exploitation of workers,RyanAir's decades of customer service horror stories, Google slyly but - perhaps- 
fittinglydisavow its promise not to be evil, and Brewdog allegedly mistreat its own staff, undercut its supporters, and 
mislead the public,among a series of misdemeanours. Even Facebook, perhaps the most scandal-riven of Big 
Tech's oligopoly, could ride out its bad PR with a simple rebrand. History is littered with examples,but even in the 
age of 'cancel culture' a PR scandal does not lastingly and damagingly impact brands that dominate their respective 
markets. We are all complicit. A company does something dreadful and we say'I will never give XXXXX my 
business again' but within weeks or months, sometimes days - whether through necessity or convenience- we're 
drawn back. And brands know this: in factthey rely on it. We joke that P&O's PR department were first to go,but 
more accurately they probably took the view that, as long as their ferries are running, people have too few other 
options stop to using them. So, in pursuit of cost cuts and long-term financial salvation, they deemed the short-term 
outrage worth the bad PR. And soit will prove. In the corporate world, just as in the political, rhetoric and righteous 
outrage isn't enough to make dominant brands behave. If things are ever going to change, then activism need to be 
channelled into a very clear purpose, whether that's pressure on governments to change the law, intervene, or 
suffer at the ballot box. 
Will P&O Ferries get cancelled?

Mar 22, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has unveiled its decarbonisation strategy as the airline aims to become carbon neutral 
by 2050. 
RYAAY expects 34% of the decarbonisation to take place through the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels 
(SAF). To this end, the airline is trying to accelerate the supply of SAF by working with the European Union and fuel 
suppliers. The company has partnered with Trinity College Dublin to establish Ryanair Sustainable Aviation 
Research Centre, which should help in research on SAF, Zero Carbon Aircraft Propulsion Systems and Noise 
Mapping. 
Ryanair anticipates 32% of the decarbonisation to happen via technological & operational improvements. The 
company intends to continue investing in new technology and aircraft. It has invested $22 billion to purchase 210 
Boeing 737-8200 'Gamechanger' aircraft, which can carry 4% more passengers, reduce fuel consumption and 
carbon 
dioxide 
emissions 
by 
16%.

Ryanair expects to reduce emissions by offsetting measures. Carbon capture offset projects and government 
policies and reforms, such as the introduction of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR), are expected to 
help RYAAY meet 24% of its decarbonation target. The company expects to achieve the remaining 10% of its 
decarbonization target through better air traffic management. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation[4] sector are as follows: 
USA Truck USAK[5] sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (in line in one), the average surprise being 64.4%. You

emissions and the impact of its operations on the environment, this strategy outlines four core strategic pillars 
underpinning the airline's ambitious goal of net carbon zero by 2050:
34% decarbonisation through the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF)
32% decarbonisation through technological & operational improvements
24% decarbonisation through offsetting & other economic measures
10% decarbonisation through the introduction of better Air Traffic Management
With more than 1/3 of its decarbonisation to come from the increased use of SAF, Ryanair is working with the EU 
and fuel suppliers to accelerate supply of SAF. As part of this, Ryanair established the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation 
Research Centre in partnership with Trinity College Dublin. This partnership will deliver research in SAF, Zero 
Carbon Aircraft Propulsion Systems and Noise Mapping.
Ryanair will continue to invest in new technology, aircraft, as underpinned by its US$22bn commitment to purchase 
210 Boeing 737-8200 'Gamechanger' aircraft. To date the airline has taken delivery of 55 'Gamechanger' aircraft, 
which carry 4% more passengers, reduces fuel consumption & CO2 by 16% and lowers noise emissions by 40%.
The final leg of Ryanair's Pathway to Net Zero will come from a combination of offsetting measures, through carbon 
capture offset projects and the support of key govt policies and reforms, such as the introduction of the Single 
European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative. If successfully introduced by the European Commission, the 
SESAR would deliver a standardised and more efficient air traffic management process, delivering a significant & 
immediate 10% reduction in European aviation carbon emissions.
Ryanair's Director of Sustainability, Thomas Fowler, said: "As Europe's greenest major airline, Ryanair understands 
that aviation plays a pivotal role in tackling climate change and our Pathway to Net Zero will help us do just that.
We are working tirelessly with our team and strategic partners to lead the way in making aviation more sustainable. 
We were delighted to be upgraded to a 'B' rating by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) this year, recognising our 
commitment to reducing our environmental impact. While we've already come a long way, we will continue to lead 
Ryanair aims to become carbon neutral by 2050
the sustainable aviation agenda in European aviation as we embark on our ambitious Pathway to Net Zero by 
2050."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) plans to use sustainable aviation fuels for its planes to achieve a third of its 
decarbonization target, and offset measures to cut its emissions to net-zero by 2050, Reuters reported Monday, 
citing a statement. 
The measures, which will reportedly include carbon capture offset projects and supporting government policies and 
reforms, are expected to contribute a further 24% toward its target, the Irish airline said.
The carrier said on Monday that its order of 210 Boeing (BA) 737 MAX jets, which use about 16% less fuel than the 
current generation of 737s will help it meet 32% of its decarbonization target.
The company last year disclosed plans to use sustainable aviation fuels by 2030 for 12.5% of its flights, according 
to the Reuters report.

Mar 21, 2022( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Increasing its uptake of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) to slightly over one-third (34 percent) is one of the means 
how Irish low-cost carrierRyanair[1] wants to become carbon neutral by 2050. The use of more SAF is part of its 
'Pathway to Net Zero' that was presented on March 21. Ryanair targets use of one-third of SAF by 2050. 
Ryanair is claiming to be one of the greenest airlines, with pre-Covid carbon dioxide emissions of 66 grams per 
passenger and per kilometer. That's fifty percent less than many European flag carriers, Ryanair said in its 2021 
annual report. It reached this number thanks to a modern 'green' fleet, voluntary offsetting programs for customers 
since April 2020, and smarter operations. 
The latest plan builds on the earlier strategy and is outlined in the 2021 sustainability report[2]. Ryanair said earlier 
that it wanted to increase the use of SAFs to 12.5 percent in 2030 but now intends to make another jump to 34 
percent by 2050. With SAF still very much in short supply in Europe (and elsewhere), Ryanair calls on the 
European Union and suppliers to stimulate the production. It will use its partnership with Trinity College in Dublin to 
further determine the sustainability of SAF and accelerate the certification of new blends. Ryanair welcomes the 
RefuelEU initiative of the European Commission's Fit for 55 packages to mandate the use of five percent SAF by 
2030, although it says it is well below its own initiative. 
MAX 8200 and more efficient operations should save another 32 percent in emissions 
Another third (32 percent) of its net-zero plan must come from technological and operational improvements. The 
technological jump must come by introducing more fuel-efficient Boeing MAX 8200[3] into the fleet, of which it now 
has 55 with another 155 on order. They reduce fuel burn per seat by sixteen percent and operate at forty percent 
lower noise levels. Combined with the use of SAF, the MAX 8200 should help reduces CO2 emissions from the 
current 66 grams per passenger/km to sixty grams in 2030. 
On the operational side, Ryanair sees improvements thanks to using more optimized flight plans that save fuel, the 
use of auxiliary power units and single-engine ground taxi operations wherever possible, plus more continuous 
descent approaches into airports. This is also part of Ryanair's quest to improve air traffic management with the 
Single European Sky SESAR program, which has been tested since last year and should bring ten percent fuel 
savings. Together withAirlines 4 Europe[4] and in his previous role as its chairman, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary 
has been pushing for the swift introduction of SES for years. Under the current European Commission, there finally 
seems to be some movement on the subject. 
Ryanair targets use of one-third of SAF by 2050
The final quarter (24 percent) of Ryanair's carbon zero targets in 2050 must come from offsetting and other 
economic measures. The airline sees options for carbon capture offsetting programs as well as other offsetting 
schemes, but opposes additional kerosene taxes that have been proposed by theFit for 55[5] plan for intra-
European flights. The carriers said that in 2020, it already paid €630 million inenvironmental taxes[6] but delivered 
no benefits as the proceeds hardly ever are applied to sustainability initiatives for aviation. The EU-tax scheme will 
do nothing for the 'highest polluters', which are the long-haul, intercontinental flights. 
Offsetting schemes should be refined 
Ryanair is more in favor of improving the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the worldwide CORSIA 
offsetting scheme, which should help reduce emissions in 2035 by some 2.5 billion tonnes. The airline calls on 
refining existing carbon-pricing mechanisms before creating new ones. It also wants to 'earmark any revenue raised 
from auctioning emission allowances to finance the high-tech transition towards lower-emitting aircraft that carry a 
higher load factor.' This would fit its own fleet of high-capacity MAX 8200s. 
Part of the offsetting plan also is offering the option to passengers. Ryanair launched its Carbon Calculator in July 
2021, offering passengers a choice to partially offset their flight for €2 of in full for €4.20. The scheme has been 
used by three percent of its customers, raising €3.5 million, but Ryanair wants to grow this. In all, the Irish carrier 
hopes to achieve the A-climate protection score next year from CDP, up from the already high current B-score.

JMC Group has signed an agreement to support nine aircraft through the Boeing 737 Flight Length Sensitive (FLS) 
inspection programme with popular low-cost carrier, Ryanair. The agreement marks the first time the two 
companies have worked together, with the two lines of nose-to-tail FLS inspections taking place throughout the 
remainder of the winter season.
Tony Eversden, JMC Group's Head of Engineering, commented: "We're delighted to have been appointed to 
support the FLS inspection programme on Ryanair's Boeing 737 aircraft. FLS operations can be delivered globally 
by our dedicated in-house team of engineers, all of whom are experienced in delivering a wide range of scheduled 
and ad-hoc maintenance services within the aviation sector."
FLS tasks require mandatory fuel tank structure inspections, which involve JMC technicians carrying out all the 
preparation for NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) by removing sealant and cleaning, often working in compact areas 
with limited accessibility. After the necessary inspections are completed the JMC technicians will re-seal the 
disturbed areas.
"Given the complex nature of the work and limited access, our team of technicians can be relied on to carry out the 
necessary modifications safely and to the highest standards," Eversden added.
Joel Crook, JMC Group's Project Manager for Fixed Price Engineering has been tasked to oversee the team of 
specialist engineers and ensure all aspects of the work are managed in line with Ryanair's requirements.
Adam Hale, Head of Base Maintenance at Ryanair said: "We are looking forward to working with JMC's FLS 
inspection team on our Boeing 737 aircraft at Prestwick Airport. Maintaining airworthiness of our aircraft is our 
number one priority and JMC's reputation for accomplishing tasks safely and to the highest standards supported 
our decision to appoint them to support our FLS inspection programme."

Litigators should now put defendants on notice at the start of any matter that they will enforce an equitable lien if 
necessary, the senior partner of Bott & Co has advised. 
David Bott also described Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling was a 'fantastic day' for access to justice and meant 
solicitors could innovate and process claims using technology as his firm had done. 
'The court accepted the fact that the law isn't people with quills anymore,' he said. 
The Supreme Court ruled by majority[1] that Bott & Co did have a lien over compensation that Ryanair paid directly 
to its flight delay clients, even if the claims were uncontested. 
The defendant needs to be on notice if a solicitor wants to enforce an equitable lien and Bott & Co now does so 
from the start, Mr Bott said. 
All claimant solicitors should do the same, he said. 'It's like insurance - most of the time you won't need it, but it's 
there if you do.' 
The next step in the case will be for Bott & Co to seek an order requiring the airline to list every client it had paid - 
while some told the law firm, not all did. And of those that did, 30% did not then hand over the 95 fee from the 
compensation that they owed the firm. 
Coby Benson, the solicitor who leads the flight delay compensation team at Bott & Co, said there had been a 
widespread misunderstanding that such claims were simple and uncontested - in fact, the firm has had to issue 
proceedings in 45% of the 226,000 successful claims it has brought since 2013. 
The business model worked on the swings and roundabouts of volume. 'The advantage of our service is that client 
commits to paying the same 95 fee and that's regardless of how far the case goes,' he said. 
He explained that this misunderstanding came from the inclusion in the defendant's trial bundle of a screenshot of 
the Bott & Co website that claimed a 99% success rate. 
This actually related to personal injury work that went to trial but was not commented on by the High Court. 
However, it was picked up by the Court of Appeal, by which time Bott & Co could not adduce any new evidence on 
the point, and 'nearly led to the demise of our case', Mr Benson said. 
However, Lord Briggs in the Supreme Court commended the firm's service for dealing with 'impediments to access 
to justice'. 
Bott urges solicitors to put all defendants on notice of equitable lien
Mr Bott said the policy underlying the decision recognised the growth in types of litigation where compensation was 
awarded on a fixed or tariff basis and through systems that discouraged litigation, like the new whiplash portal - and 
against the background of a push for more alternative dispute resolution to reduce pressure on the courts. 
'If the lien only existed in certain circumstances, the expansion of these regimes would be thwarted,' he said. 'It is a 
very pragmatic, modern judgment.' 
'You don't need proceedings, you don't need a dispute but you need a significant contribution' - a bar the Supreme 
Court said was low. 
Mr Bott added: 'It is reassuring that the courts acknowledge that access to justice is well served by our activities 
and that airlines - or any potential defendant - should not interfere in matters where the claimant has chosen legal 
representation. 
'As far as access to justice is concerned, it's a fantastic day.' 
In its statement, Ryanair said it welcomed the Supreme Court's 'recognition that solicitors should advise passengers 
to claim directly using Ryanair's simple online claims procedure without incurring legal fees'. 
It went on: 'These Supreme Court findings compliment the Court of Appeal's 2019 final ruling regarding Ryanair's 
online claims procedure which upheld Ryanair's policy of requiring consumers to use that straightforward procedure 
before engaging third parties 
'Ryanair urges customers with valid EU261 compensation claims to submit their claims directly to Ryanair and 
avoid 'claims chaser' firms such as Bott & Co, Fairplane, Hayward Baker, Sky Legal and Flightright, who can deduct 
over 40% of a 220 claim in fees.' 
It said a claims team 'processes all valid claims within an industry-leading period of 10 working days'.

 Causeway Capital Management, the Los Angeles-based firm founded by  
Sarah Ketterer [1] (Trades[2], Portfolio[3]) and Harry Hartford in 2001, seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted 
returns by investing in mispriced equities in both developed as well as emerging markets. Using quantitative and 
value-oriented methods, the guru and her team look for potential investment opportunities among mid- and large-
cap companies. Each stock also receives a risk score based on the additional volatility or risk it adds to the 
portfolio. The investment team then enters positions in the stocks with the highest expected risk-adjusted return that 
also have a lower price-earnings ratio and higher dividend yield than the market. 
As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the industrials sector had the second-largest representation in Ketterer's 
$4.5 billion 13F equity portfolio with a weight of 22.73%. Investors should be aware that 13F filings do not give a 
complete picture of a guru's holdings; they only consider the U.S.-based holdings and American depository 
receipts. Regardless, they can still provide valuable information. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/sarah+ketterer/summary 
Further, the industrials space may offer value opportunities currently as the sector has fallen 4.94% year to date on 
the back of higher inflation, supply chain constraints and uncertainty surrounding the war in Ukraine. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/dashboard 
According to GuruFocus portfolio data[4], Ketterer's five largest industrials holdings as of the three months ended 
Dec. 31 were Ryanair Holdings PLC ( RYAAY[5], Financial[6]), Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI[7], 
Financial[8]), General Electric Co. (GE[9], Financial[10]), Waste Management Inc. (WM[11], Financial[12]) and 
Carrier Global Corp. (CARR[13], Financial[14]). Ryanair Holdings 
In the fourth quarter, Ketterer boosted her stake in Ryanair Holdings ( RYAAY[15], Financial[16]) by 3.84% to 5.02 
million shares. The position accounts for 12.12% of the equity portfolio and is the largest holding overall. GuruFocus 
estimates she has gained 29.28% on the investment since establishing it in the third quarter of 2016.

The Irish airline, which is a low-cost carrier operating predominately in secondary airports, has a $19.53 billion 
market cap; its shares were trading around $86.64 on Friday with a price-book ratio of 3.2 and a price-sales ratio of 
4.23. 
The GF Value Line suggests the stock is significantly overvalued currently based on its historical ratios, past 
financial performance and future earnings projections.

https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/RYAAY/summary?position=warning-signs 
GuruFocus has not rated Ryanair's financial strength or profitability. The company has been issuing new long-term 
debt over the past several years, however, and the Altman Z-Score of 1.78 warns it could be at risk of bankruptcy if 
it does not improve its leverage. 
The company is also being weighed down by negative margins and returns on equity, assets and capital that 
underperform a majority of competitors. The moderate Piotroski F-Score of 6 out of 9, however, indicates 
operations are typical for a stable company. Even though it has recorded declines in revenue per share and losses 
in operating income over the past several years, Ryanair has a predictability rank of one out of five stars. According 
to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return an average of 1.1% annually over a 10-year period. 
Of the gurus invested in Ryanair,  
Baillie Gifford [17] (Trades[18], Portfolio[19]) has the largest stake with 4.69% of its outstanding shares. David Herro 
[20] (Trades[21], Portfolio[22]), Jim Simons [23] (Trades[24], Portfolio[25])' Renaissance Technologies, the 
Causeway International Value [26] (Trades[27], Portfolio[28]) Fund, PRIMECAP Management [29] (Trades[30], 
Portfolio[31]), Julian Robertson [32] (Trades[33], Portfolio[34]), Jeremy Grantham [35] (Trades[36], Portfolio[37]) 
and Francis Chou [38] (Trades[39], Portfolio[40]) also have positions in the stock. Canadian National Railway 
The guru established a position in Canadian National Railway ( CNI[41], Financial[42]) during the quarter, buying 
1.79 million shares. With a weight of 4.37% in the equity portfolio, it is now her third-largest position. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/sarah+ketterer/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table&sector=310 
The Canadian railroad company, which provides freight services in Canada and parts of the U.S., has a market cap 
of $89.66 billion; its shares were trading around $129.64 on Friday with a price-earnings ratio of 23.75, a price-book 
ratio of 5.05 and a price-sales ratio of 8.03. 
According to the GF Value Line, the stock is modestly overvalued currently. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CNI/summary?position=back-to-top 
Canadian National's financial strength was rated 5 out of 10 by GuruFocus. Although the company has issued new 
long-term debt in recent years, it is at a manageable level due to adequate interest coverage. The Altman Z-Score 
of 4 also indicates it is in good standing. The return on invested capital overshadows the weighted average cost of 
capital, meaning value is being created as the company grows. 
The company's profitability fared even better, scoring a 10 out of 10 rating. Even though its margins are in decline, 
returns outperform over half of its industry peers. Canadian National is also supported by a high Piotroski F-Score 
of 9, indicating business conditions are healthy. Consistent earnings and revenue growth have also contributed to a 
3.5-star predictability rank. GuruFocus says companies with this rank return an average of 9.3% annually. 
With a 1.87% stake,  
Bill Gates [43] (Trades[44], Portfolio[45])' foundation trust has the largest stake in Canadian National. Other top 
guru investors include Simons' firm, Steven Cohen [46] (Trades[47], Portfolio[48]), Ray Dalio [49] (Trades[50], 
Portfolio[51]) and Louis Moore Bacon [52] (Trades[53], Portfolio[54]). General Electric 
The investor upped her General Electric ( GE[55], Financial[56]) stake by 53.38% during the quarter. She now holds 
1.53 million shares, which represent 3.19% of the equity portfolio and is her fifth-largest holding. GuruFocus data 
shows she has lost an estimated 9.66% on the investment since establishing it in the third quarter of 2021. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/sarah+ketterer/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table&sector=310 
The enduring industrial conglomerate headquartered in Boston, which recently announced it will be splitting into 
three separate companies, has a $104.26 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $94.73 on Friday with a 
price-book ratio of 2.58 and a price-sales ratio of 1.41. 
Based on the GF Value Line, the stock appears to be significantly overvalued currently. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/GE/summary?position=back-to-top 
General Electric's financial strength and profitability were both rated 5 out of 10 by GuruFocus. In addition to weak 
interest coverage, the Altman Z-Score of 1.43 warns the company could be in danger of going bankrupt. The 
WACC also eclipses the ROIC, indicating the company is struggling to create value as it grows. 
The company is being weighed down by margins and returns that underperform a majority of competitors, but has a 
moderate Piotroski F-Score of 5. The one-star predictability rank is also on watch as a result of declining revenue 
per share. 
Andreas Halvorsen [57] (Trades[58], Portfolio[59]) has the largest stake in General Electric with 1.64% of its 
outstanding shares. Hotchkis & Wiley, Richard Pzena [60] (Trades[61], Portfolio[62]), the T Rowe Price Equity 
Income Fund [63] (Trades[64], Portfolio[65]), Nelson Peltz [66] (Trades[67], Portfolio[68]), Mason Hawkins [69] 
5 Industrials Stocks Sarah Ketterer Sees Value In
(Trades[70], Portfolio[71]), Bill Nygren [72] (Trades[73], Portfolio[74]) and Simons' firm also have significant 
positions in the stock. Waste Management 
 Ketterer increased her Waste Management ( WM[75], Financial[76]) holding by 25.51% in the most recent quarter. 
Representing 1.63% of the equity portfolio, she now owns 443,758 shares total. GuruFocus says she has gained an 
estimated 
12.64% 
on 
the 
investment 
so 
far. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/sarah+ketterer/current-
portfolio/portfolio?view=table&sector=310 
 The Houston-based company, which provides traditional waste management and recycling services, has a market 
cap of $64.19 billion; its shares were trading around $154.76 on Friday with a price-earnings ratio of 36, a price-
book ratio of 9.04 and a price-sales ratio of 3.65. 
The GF Value Line suggests the stock is fairly valued currently. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/WM/summary?position=back-to-top 
GuruFocus rated Waste Management's financial strength 4 out of 10. Despite the company issuing new long-term 
debt over the past several years, it is at a manageable level due to sufficient interest coverage. The high Altman Z -
Score of 3.22 also indicates the company is in good standing even though assets are building up at a faster rate 
than revenue is growing. Value creation is occurring since the ROIC exceeds the WACC. 
The company's profitability fared better with a 9 out of 10 rating. While the operating margin is in decline, returns 
top a majority of industry peers. Waste Management is also supported by a high Piotroski F-Score of 7. Due to 
consistent earnings and revenue growth, it also has a 2.5-star predictability rank. GuruFocus data shows 
companies with this rank return, on average, 7.3% annually. 
Of the gurus invested in Waste Management, Gates' foundation trust has the largest stake with 4.45% of its 
outstanding shares. Addition guru investors are  
Mario Gabelli [77] (Trades[78], Portfolio[79]), Paul Tudor Jones [80] (Trades[81], Portfolio[82]), Dalio, Simons' firm, 
Joel Greenblatt [83] (Trades[84], Portfolio[85]), Ken Fisher [86] (Trades[87], Portfolio[88]) and Jeff Auxier [89] 
(Trades[90], Portfolio[91]). Carrier Global 
The guru added 0.15% to her Carrier Global ( CARR[92], Financial[93]) stake to 1.14 million shares. The stock 
represents 1.36% of the equity portfolio. GuruFocus data shows Ketterer has gained an estimated 31.01% on the 
investment 
since 
establishing 
it 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2020. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/sarah+ketterer/current-portfolio/portfolio?view=table&sector=310 
Headquartered in Florida, the HVAC company, which was spun off of United Technologies Corp. in 2020, has a 
$40.11 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $47.10 on Friday with a price-earnings ratio of 25.14, a 
price-book ratio of 5.99 and a price-sales ratio of 2.04. 
The Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overvalued. 
https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CARR/summary?position=peter-lynch-chart 
Carrier's financial strength and profitability were both rated 5 out of 10 by GuruFocus. Although the company has 
issued new long-term debt recently, it is at a manageable level as a result of adequate interest coverage. The 
Altman Z-Score of 2.77, however, indicates it is under some pressure. The ROIC also surpasses the WACC, so 
value is being created. 
The company is supported by strong margins and returns that outperform a majority of competitors as well as a 
high Piotroski F-Score of 7. 
With a 2.3% stake, Dodge & Cox is Carrier's largest guru shareholder. Other top guru investors include Primecap,  
Diamond Hill Capital [94] (Trades[95], Portfolio[96]), Simons' firm and Fisher. Additional holdings in the industrials 
space 
Other stocks Ketterer owns in the industrials sector as of the end of the fourth quarter are Azul SA ( AZUL[97], 
Financial[98]), ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM[99], Financial[100]) and ABB Ltd. (ABB[101], 
Financial[102]).

Irish Tourism Begins Long Road To Recovery On St. Patrick's Day
Irish Tourism Begins Long Road To Recovery On St. Patrick's Day

Mar 17, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ireland celebrated St. Patrick's Day with packed parades through its towns and cities for the first time in three years 
on Thursday, celebrations its battered tourism sector hopes will begin a long road to recovery. 
The national holiday traditionally kicked off the tourism season before COVID-19 cut the number of arrivals in 
Ireland below 5 million in both 2020 and 2021 from the record 20 million in 2019, four times the country's 
population. 
For Cathal O'Connell, whose green Paddywagon coaches bus visitors from around the world to tourist spots like the 
Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Blarney Stone, winning back 40% to 50% of his pre-pandemic customers 
this year "would be a win". 
"From what I'm getting bookings wise, and my business would be a good barometer, that's what it looks like," said 
O'Connell, who unlike many hospitality operators could not fall back on a booming staycation market over the past 
two summers. 
"Had it gone on another year, we would have gone under and we were probably one of the most successful tourist 
companies in the country. We'll make a heavy loss this year. If we can get back to break-even in the next three 
years, we'll be doing well." 
O'Connell said he was essentially "asset stripping" to get back to profit, had started to sell some of his 70 buses 
and had so far shut three of Paddywagon's seven tourist shops. Having employed 188 people in 2019, it now has a 
staff of 35. 
Around 10% of Ireland's workforce was employed in tourism-related sectors before the pandemic, behind only 
Iceland and Spain among OECD members. 
North American tourists, who represented nearly a quarter of all visitors in 2019, were beginning to come back and 
"doing what Americans do best, going for the higher end", O'Connell said. The European market had yet to recover 
at all, he added. 
Ireland's main transatlantic carrier, Aer Lingus, is seeing strong demand over the St Patrick's weekend, celebrated 
with an additional bank holiday this year, a spokesperson said. The airline's capacity is close to 70% of 2019 levels 
this week. 
Low-cost rival Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, plans to operate its largest ever summer 
schedule from Dublin Airport, where traffic hit 77% of 2019 levels in the past week, an airport spokesperson said. 
The return of flight capacity from a year ago when Ireland had the strictest travel curbs in the EU also prompted a 
buoyant outlook from the country's largest hotel operator, Dalata hotel Group, earlier this month. 
Irish Tourism Begins Long Road To Recovery On St. Patrick's Day
For Paddywagon owner O'Connell, the sight on Thursday of huge crowds lining Dublin's main thoroughfare of 
O'Connell Street, home to one his four stores that for now remain open, already represents "a major comeback". 
"Two months ago we wouldn't have predicted this. It'll all come back," he said. "It's like a footballer with a bad injury 
- it just takes time to get back on the pitch."

IT HAD been a long time in between drinks for Alan King at the Cheltenham Festival before Edwardstone landed 
Tuesday's Sporting Life Arkle.
His last winner at this meeting was Uxizandre in the 2015 Ryanair, incidentally also AP McCoy's final Festival 
winner, but he may not have to wait too long for the next one.
THE GLANCING QUEEN takes her chance in this afternoon's Craft Irish Whiskey Co. Plate Handicap Chase 
(4.10pm), where she must have a massive chance after her fine second to L'Homme Presse in the Paddy Power 
Novices' Chase here on New Year's Day.
She had Ultima Handicap third Oscar Elite well behind her that day and the handicapper kindly decided to drop her 
a pound to a mark of 141.
Considering she had won two Listed mares' novice chases on her previous two starts, I think it's fair to say she is 
well-handicapped off that mark.
At 11/2 with Fitzdares, she looks a decent bet to give King and Tom Cannon another memorable winner.
Celebre D'Allen and Imperial Alcazar are both worthy challengers, although the former is a 10-year-old and you 
have to go back to 2011 to find the last time a horse of that age was successful.
There are some interesting contenders from Ireland like Grand Paradis and Fancy Foundations, but I'm happy to 
stick with the mare.
In the closing Kim Muir Handicap Chase (5.30pm), COME ON TEDDY looks over-priced at 16/1 with bet365 who 
are offering six places.
KING CAN RELY ON HIS QUEEN FOR MORE CHELTENHAM GLORY
Tom George's eight-year-old was third in the Pertemps Final last year and then fifth in the aforementioned Paddy 
Power Novices' Chase here in January.
That looks to be strong form, over a trip too short for him, and Will Biddick is a good jockey booking.
He made a couple of errors last time at Newcastle, which he can't afford to do in this, but he always goes well at 
Cheltenham and looks to have solid claims.
I will also throw a few quid each-way on MISTER FOGPATCHES at 12/1 with bet365.
He struggles to get his head in front, but he is very consistent and ran well to be second to Commodore here in 
December. He has also been placed in the Cork Grand National, the Troytown and the Thyestes this season, three 
of the most competitive handicap chases in Ireland, so we know he thrives on this kind of test.
Patrick Mullins has been booked by Pat Fahy which is a good sign of confidence in his chance.
Gordon Elliott holds a strong hand with Frontal Assault and Smoking Gun, while School Boy Hours would be a 
threat to all but if the ground dries out too quickly he might not even run.
Winter Fog has been the talking horse for the Pertemps Final (2.10pm) over the past couple of weeks but he is now 
pretty short at 5/1.
The one who I think is the best-handicapped in the race is ALAPHILIPPE for Fergal O'Brien.
He was just behind Stattler in last year's Albert Bartlett and reappeared with an eyecatching run in a qualifier at 
Warwick in January behind Sporting John.
Dropped a couple of pounds for that, he will be running off 138 this afternoon and I think he will prove plenty better 
than that in the future.
At 7/1 with Fitzdares' six places, he represents decent value.
You cannot rule out 2019 and 2020 winner Sire Du Berlais who stepped up to the Stayers' Hurdle last year and 
finished second to Flooring Porter.
Back in these calmer waters, and with Rob James taking off seven pounds from the saddle, he has to be respected 
off just a four-pound higher mark than when last successful two years ago.
Whoever you're backing today, you should also have a go at racing prediction game Whoknowswins.
All you have to do is download the app, enter the Cheltenham league on the home page and pick your selections in 
all of today's races.
Each entry costs £5 and you can enter up to 20 times. The punter with the most correct picks at the end of the day 
wins the pool, with the top 20 percent of entrants also receiving a pay-out

 (L-R): Fan 'Frank' Liu, Matthew Ziburis, Qiang 'Jason' Sun (via DOJ court filings) 
A congressional candidate in New York, an artist, and pro-democracy activists were all targets of a scheme by 
Chinese officials to silence critics of that country's repressive regime. 
The candidate, a former Tiananmen Square protester, scared the Chinese government so much that their agent 
was willing to smear him with false accusations of unpaid taxes and 'child porn,' try to snare him in a honey trap, or 
just 'beat him' if all else failed, the Department of Justice said in announcing a marquee case of their 'transnational 
repression' unit. 
Federal prosecutors unveiled three separate complaints against five defendants on Wednesday, alleging that they 
engaged in 'various crimes related to efforts by the secret police of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to stalk, 
harass and spy on Chinese nationals residing in Queens, New York, and elsewhere in the United States,' according 
to a press release[1]. 
Co-defendants Fan 'Frank' Liu and Matthew Ziburis were arrested Tuesday in New York, while a third co-defendant, 
Qiang 'Jason' Sun remains at large. 
Defendant Shujun Wang was arrested Wednesday in New York. The defendant in the third case, Qiming Lin, also 
remains at large. 
According to prosecutors, all the defendants 'allegedly perpetrated transnational repression schemes to target U.S. 
residents whose political views and actions are disfavored by the PRC government, such as advocating for 
democracy in the PRC.' 
Wednesday's complaints are meant to 'serve notice' to foreign intelligence agencies that 'efforts at suppression 
within our borders will not be tolerated,' said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI's Counterintelligence 
Division at the press conference Wednesday. 
FBI officials compared the charges to other recent arrests in transnational repression cases, including the 
indictment[2] in January of four Belarusan government officials in connection with the plot to divert a Ryanair Flight 
in order to arrest dissident journalist Roman Protasevich[3]. In July of 2021, the FBI announced kidnapping 
Feds Charge Five Accused of Spying on Dissidents for China. One Target Was Tiananmen Square Protester 
Now Running for Congress .
conspiracy charges[4] against Iranian intelligence officials for an alleged plot to kidnap a U.S. journalist and human 
rights activist. 
'Beat Him Until He Cannot Run for Election.' 
Prosecutors say that Qiming Lin, 59, while working on behalf of the PRC's Ministry of State Security (MSS), hired a 
private investigator to 'disrupt the campaign of a Brooklyn resident currently running for U.S. Congress (the Victim), 
including by physically attacking the Victim.' 
The target was a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He escaped 
to the U.S., served in the U.S. military, and became a nationalized citizen. According to prosecutors, he announced 
his intention to run for Congress in the November 2022 general election. 
The complaint doesn't identify the victim, but it appears to be Yan Xiong[5], who came to the U.S. in 1992 and has 
announced his intention to run for Congress as a Democrat representing part of Long Island. 
According to the complaint, Lin hired a private investigator and allegedly explained that he was working with 
unidentified individuals in the PRC to stop the victim from being elected to Congress. Lin asked the investigator to 
find private information about the target, including his name and phone number. Lin also asked for derogatory 
information, asking to 'dig up things from 1989 to now . . . To see if there are any flaws before participating in the 
election now,' according to the complaint. 
'Lin specified that 'laws' could include 'unreported, unpaid taxes' or '[e]xtramarital affairs; affairs; uh, sexual 
harassment; or child porn; eh, [homosexual activity], things of that nature,'' it continues. 
If derogatory information could not be found, the investigator was to 'manufacture something' and encouraged the 
investigator to 'go find a girl or see how he goes for prostitution, take some photos, something of that nature,' 
prosecutors say. 
Prosecutors allege that Lin didn't stop there. 
In December 2021, Lin suggested that the investigator physically injure the candidate. 
According to prosecutors, Lin said in a voicemail: 
You can start thinking now, aside from violence, what other plans are there? Huh? But in the end, violence would 
be fine too. Huh? Beat him [chuckles], beat him until he cannot run for election. Heh, that's the-the last resort. You-
you think about it. Car accident, [he] will be completely wrecked [chuckles], right? Don't know, eh, whatever ways 
from all different angles. Or, on the day of the election, he cannot make it there himself, right? 
Shujun Wang: Pro-Democracy Activist Turned PRC Informer? 
Shujun Wang, 73, was a founder of the Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang Memorial Foundation, a Queens-based 
organization dedicated to honoring former leaders of the Chinese Communist Party who advocated for reforms and 
were ultimately forced from power. 
According to prosecutors, Wang's position in the organization was just a front: since at least 2015, he was working 
under the direction of four MSS handlers and secretly provided PRC officials with information about prominent 
activists, dissidents, and human rights leaders, according to the complaint. 
'Although Wang is a member of the pro-democracy Memorial Foundation, the investigation has revealed that he 
has been acting as an agent of the PRC government, using his position with the Memorial Foundation and within 
the Chinese diaspora community in the New York metropolitan area to collect information about U.S.- based 
dissidents and to pass that information to the PRC government,' the complaint said. 
Alleged victims included people and groups in New York and elsewhere that the PRC considers 'subversive,' such 
as Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, advocates for Taiwanese independence, and Uyghur and Tibetan activists. 
One democracy activist in Hong Kong who Wang reported was jailed in April 2020 on political charges. Other 
activists had been listed on a handwritten document Wang allegedly carried with him when he traveled to New York 
from the PRC in April 2019. 
Wang allegedly communicated with the MSS officials through electronic 'diary' entries in what appears to be a 
shared calendar or email account. 
'While operating under the direction and control of MSS officials, Wang communicated the information he gathered 
through 'diary' entries, which he sometimes referred to as 'William's diary,'' the complaint says. 'While WANG 
sometimes sent messages containing 'diary' entries to his MSS handlers and other PRC officials via email, he also 
saved them in draft email form to allow others to access the account and read the 'diary' entry without the message 
being sent.' 
Feds Charge Five Accused of Spying on Dissidents for China. One Target Was Tiananmen Square Protester 
Now Running for Congress .
The complaint alleges that 'MSS officers or persons working with them accessed Wang's email account to retrieve 
the substance of the 'diary' entries. 
The complaint also accuses Wang of lying to federal law enforcement during an interview in Queens in August of 
2017, when he 'falsely den[ied] that he had contacts with PRC officials or the MSS when in fact he had been 
secretly reporting on U.S. residents to the MSS. Wang later admitted much of his criminal conduct to an undercover 
member of law enforcement and during a subsequent interview with agents.' 
Fan 'Frank' Liu to Matthew Ziburis: Say Your Boss is 'Very Rich Jewish Man.' 
In the third complaint released Wednesday, Fan 'Frank' Liu, 62, Matthew Ziburis, 49, and Qiang 'Jason' Sun, 40, 
allegedly hatched a plot to bribe an IRS agent to release the tax documents of a pro-democracy dissident. They are 
also accused of spying on a dissident artist. 
Liu is president of what prosecutors describe as a 'purported media company based in New York City.' Ziburis is a 
former correctional officer for the State of Florida and a bodyguard, and Sun is a PRC-based employee of an 
international technology company. 
Liu, at Sun's direction, allegedly hired a private investigator to bribe an IRS employee to get the federal tax returns 
of one dissident. 
'The private investigator was cooperating with law enforcement, and no Internal Revenue Service employee 
received a bribe payment,' the FBI press release said, adding that the defendants planned to publicly disclose the 
dissident's potential tax liabilities in order to discredit him. 
Liu, Sun, and Ziburis also allegedly planned to destroy the work of a dissent artist who is critical of the PRC 
government. 
'[T]he artist's sculpture depicting PRC President Xi Jinping as a coronavirus molecule was demolished in the Spring 
2021,' the press release said. 
Although prosecutors do not name the artist, the complaint includes a picture matching a report of the destruction[6] 
of Weiming Chen's artwork 'CCP Virus.' 
Ziburis apparently accessed Chen by posing as an art broker, according to the complaint. 
'[W]hen you sit down together have table meeting or lunch or dinner, they will ask your background & who your 
boss, you can say: my [boss] is very rich Jewish man & head of Jewish community, he Donate money to support 
few democratic presidents & speaker of house, especially Nancy Pelosi,' Liu allegedly instructed Ziburis ahead of 
his meeting with Chen in California, adding that Ziburis should tell the artist that his 'boss' wants to build a 
'democratic museum' in New York or Washington. 
Ziburis surreptitiously installed surveillance cameras at the artist's workplace and in his car; the live video feed and 
location data went directly to Sun in the PRC, according to the complaint. 
The defendants also allegedly planned to use Liu's 'purported' media company as a cover for 'mock media 
sessions' which were designed to 'elicit answers that were intended to humiliate or discredit the dissidents,' 
according to the FBI. 
Liu appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge James R. Cho on Wednesday and denied the allegations. He was 
released on $30,000 bond and was placed on electronic monitoring. 
Ziburis and Wang were also scheduled to appear.

Mar 16, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 We have recently updated a report on Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1]. 
Ryanair has an impressive Growth Score[2] of B. This style score condenses all the essential metrics from the 
company's financial statements to get a true sense of quality and sustainability of growth. 
Improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. The carrier's January traffic surged 
more than 400% year over year. Ryanair's traffic in February 2022 increased more than 100% year over year to 8.7 
million. Traffic has been consistently improving on a year-over-year basis in the past several months. The carrier 
raised its five-year traffic growth forecast to 50% from 33% expected earlier. Ryanair now expects traffic to grow to 
more than 225 million guests per year by March 2026 compared with the 200 million predicted earlier. 
Ryanair's liquidity position is encouraging. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company's cash and 
cash equivalents stood at $3,924 million, higher than the current debt of $434 million. This indicates that the 
company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. 
With ramp up in operations, Ryanair's operating expenses are escalating primarily due to an increase in fuel and oil 
costs and airport and handling charges. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, the carrier's operating expenses 
surged 87% year over year to €3,792 million. High operating costs have the potential to hurt the carrier's bottom 
line. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [3]sector are Expeditors International of 
Washington, Inc. EXPD[4], Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ODFL[5] and Triton International Limited TRTN[6] 
Expeditors has an earnings surprise of 34.2%, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past 
four quarters. Expeditors is being aided by the uptick in airfreight revenues. We are optimistic about the company's 
buyout of Fleet Logistics' Digital Platform. The acquisition has boosted Expeditors' online LTL shipping platform, 
Koho. The move is in line with the company's focus on Digital Solutions. 
EXPD currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
stocks here.[7] 
The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Old Dominion is pegged at 16%. Old Dominion is 
benefiting from strong performance in the LTL segment, owing to improved freight conditions. In 2021, revenues 
from the LTL services segment increased 30.7% on a year-over-year basis. 
Solid Liquidity Boosts Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Amid High Expenses
Driven by the tailwinds, the stock has increased 35% in the past year. ODFL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy). 
The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Triton is pegged at 10%. Gradual increases in 
trade volumes and container demand bode well for the company. With easing coronavirus-led restrictions in the 
United States and Europe, the company saw a strong rebound in its business in the third, the fourth of 2020 as well 
as in each of the four quarters of 2021. 
Driven by the tailwinds, the stock has increased 13.1% in the past year. TRTN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. 
 5 Stocks Set to Double  
 Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous 
recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.

 Supreme Court: 3:2 majority 
A law firm handling uncontested flight delay claims did have an equitable lien over the compensation, the Supreme 
Court has ruled, overturning the Court of Appeal. 
Lord Burrows said a solicitor could claim an equitable lien when they provided services in relation to making a 
client's claim - with or without legal proceedings - 'which significantly contribute to the successful recovery of a fund 
by the client'. 
Bott & Co Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2022] UKSC 8[1] concerned the airline dealing directly with the Cheshire 
law firm's flight delay clients, including paying them compensation. 
The Court of Appeal ruled in 2019 that the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, 
and so did not have an equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees 
due to Bott. 
The Supreme Court overturned this by a majority of three to two, with the majority - Lords Burrows and Briggs and 
Lady Arden - each reaching the same conclusion by different jurisprudential routes. Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose 
gave a joint dissenting judgment. 
Lord Briggs described the issue which divided the court as 'whether it matters that there is an 'actual or reasonably 
anticipated dispute' about the claim, at the time when the solicitors agree to act'. 
He said: 'For Lady Arden and Lord Burrows what matters is that the solicitors agree to act in furtherance of a claim. 
They point out that neither the client nor (a fortiori) the solicitors may know whether the claim will be disputed when 
the solicitors are asked to act 
'For Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose, the automatic conferral of the lien whenever solicitors are pursuing a claim fails 
adequately to reflect the animating principle, that it should serve access to justice. 
'If all that a solicitor does is write a letter on behalf of a client asking for payment of a sum of money about which 
there can be no reasonable possibility of a dispute, or likelihood of refusal to pay once demanded, then that activity 
is unconnected with access to justice.' 
The Supreme Court reviewed its 2018 decision in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co, which 
Lord Burrows said was 'best interpreted as supporting a clear, principled and easy-to-apply test' on the equitable 
lien 'that does not turn on whether there was a dispute'. 
Supreme Court upholds solicitors' lien in 'uncontested' cases
This case could not be distinguished from Gavin Edmondson, he went on. The test for a solicitor's equitable lien 
was 'whether a solicitor provides services (within the scope of the retainer with its client) in relation to the making of 
a client's claim (with or without legal proceedings) which significantly contribute to the successful recovery of a fund 
by the client'. 
He explained: 'That seems to me to be the best interpretation of what Gavin Edmondson laid down. It is a clear and 
simple test to apply. Solicitors (and potential defendants) will know exactly where they stand.' 
This approach promoted access to justice: 'The vindication of a client's legal rights, through the making of claims, is 
more likely to be effective if solicitors know that they have the security of a lien to recover their costs.' 
A year after Bott & Co launched its largely automated flight compensation system in 2013, Ryanair developed its 
own system for its customers to use. 
The question, Lord Burrows said, was whether Bott's service then provided 'no added value to what a reasonably 
competent customer of Ryanair can sort out for himself or herself without incurring any legal costs'. 
He decided: 'However, if one looks at this question in the context of Bott's services generally in relation to flight 
compensation claims, it can fairly be said that Bott has made a significant contribution to the recovery of 
compensation by its clients.' 
This linked to the question of whether it was acceptable for solicitors to charge fees where a person could very 
easily make a claim and recover compensation without incurring any legal fees. 
Lord Burrows said: 'Clearly it is important that people are not misled by solicitors and, in certain situations, it may be 
strongly argued that any reputable solicitor would first advise a prospective client that he or she should utilise an 
online claims procedure without incurring any legal costs. 
'In so far as it is thought that a system of online compensation is being abused by solicitors to charge unnecessary 
fees, this would be a matter for the Solicitors' Regulation Authority to investigate. 
'In relation to an equitable lien, there is a well-established equitable doctrine that could be invoked to prevent any 
abuse, namely that the solicitor asserting the lien would need 'to come to equity with clean hands'.' 
Lady Arden said the equitable lien needed to be extended to cover costs incurred in the wider range of processes 
now available to resolve complaints and claims. 
'Accordingly, it seems to me that the equitable lien can and should be held to arise where there is no dispute as 
such, but the client has a claim which has not been admitted and which must be formulated and communicated to 
the service provider or other prospective defendant in order to elicit whether there is a dispute.' 
The justice observed that trying to keep a client out of court was 'an important aspect of the role of the solicitor 
these days in contentious matters'. 
She agreed with Lord Burrows that the solicitors' services must have significantly contributed to the recovery of 
money or property: 'The paying party is protected by the rule that he will not have to pay twice if he did not have the 
requisite notice and did not collude with the client.' 
Lady Arden added: 'I have borne in mind the concern that solicitors should not be in a privileged position as regards 
other professionals providing legal services, but on the information available at this time I take the view that that is 
probably a matter for Parliament perhaps when reviewing the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974 in relation to 
costs.' 
Lord Briggs, who gave the lead judgment in Gavin Edmondson, admitted that he had changed his mind about the 
present case 'more than once'. 
But he noted that any methods by which solicitors could reduce the disproportionate cost of taking action to pursue 
a small claim 'are in principle likely to serve the cause of access to justice', while 'the need for reasonable certainty 
as to the existence of the lien' was important. 
'I recognise that the simple test proposed by Lady Arden and Lord Burrows may occasionally involve the 
recognition of the equitable lien in wider circumstances than is strictly justified by its animating access to justice 
principle. 
'It may also confer upon solicitors a proprietary security for payment for services with no very sophisticated legal 
content which other providers of the same services do not enjoy, simply because they are not solicitors. The facts of 
this case illustrate both those concerns 
'But it by no means follows that a lien which in most cases will continue to promote access to justice should now be 
withdrawn or restricted in its scope merely because there are others who do the same in competition with solicitors. 
'An obvious alternative might be to extend the lien to them as well. But that is not a matter capable of being 
addressed in this case. It would in all probability best be left to legislation.' 
Supreme Court upholds solicitors' lien in 'uncontested' cases
The dissenting judgment argued that 'for a lien to arise, there must be a dispute, existing or reasonably anticipated, 
in connection with which the services of the solicitor are sought' - which was not the case in the vast majority of 
claims handled by Bott. 
But the majority warned that this would place solicitors in a very difficult position. Lord Burrows said: 'The solicitor 
needs to know in advance of providing particular services (or developing a business model) whether or not it will be 
entitled to an equitable lien if there is a successful outcome. The solicitor cannot know whether claims will or will not 
be disputed by the other side.'

Ryanair has greatly expanded its operations at Stockholm Arlanda Airport over the past six months and is now 
launching another European route from its new base. Beginning in late March, the carrier will fly twice weekly to 
Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne.
Ryanair continues its expansion in Sweden and at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and is now adding another European 
route in time for spring, to Cologne, located in the state of North Rhein-Westphalia in western Germany.
Beginning March 27, 2022, Ryanair will serve the route Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN) - Cologne Bonn Airport 
(CGN) twice weekly, on Thursdays and Sundays. Tickets are now on sale.
Cologne was served with a summer route before the pandemic, and the largest group of passengers between 
Stockholm and Cologne were private passengers, mostly tourists, but many also travelled to visit family and friends.
Ryanair is not alone is offering a direct air link from Arlanda, since Lufthansa Group's German low cost carrier, 
Eurowings, will resume service to Cologne this spring.

 [Mateusz Piątkowski is an Assistant Professor at the University of Łódź, Poland (Faculty of Law and Administration, 
International Law Department), Attorney-at-law, and Member of the Polish Society of the Military Law and the Law 
of War. The author thanks Dr Tomasz Lachowski from University of Łódź, Poland and LtnCol. Dr Wojciech Mendel 
from the Polish Society of Military Law and the Law of War for their valuable commentaries.] 
In August 2020, major civil unrest erupted in Belarus in response to the rigged presidential election. Despite the 
mass protest, president Alyaksandr Lukashenko holds effective control of the state[1], and in brutal crackdowns, 
suppresses the democratic opposition, forcing the projected winner of the 2020 election, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, 
to flee the country. Poland and Lithuania offered significant support for the oppressed Belarusians, granting them 
asylum (Tischanovskaya herself was granted asylum in Lithuania). Lukashenko's actions were condemned by the 
EU and NATO and new sanctions were imposed on the regime, as international isolation of Lukashenko 
progressed, with their only ally being the Russian Federation. 
In spring 2021 Lukashenko started to highlight in his public speeches that the actions of Lithuania, Poland and the 
EU, which in his opinion sponsored the coup d`etat in Belarus, had to be punished in a radical way. Known for his 
unchecked temperament, the dictator emphasized[2] that 'Poland will receive a huge blow'. The first warning was 
sent in May 2021, when the Polish-registered Ryanair FR4978 flying from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in 
Minsk in order to arrest the Belarusian journalist, Raman Pratasevich. The incidents also sparked a dispute[3] 
regarding the circumstances in which an aircraft flying over a state could be forced to land in order to exercise that 
state's criminal jurisdiction. As a response[4], the EU closed its airspace to Belarusian air carriers and EU state 
member state's aircraft were banned from flying over the airspace of Belarus. 
In early summer 2021, Belarus adopted significant changes in migration policies, such as a 'tourist visa' for 
nationals of the Middle East and African countries. Belarusian state-controlled tourist agencies offered affordable 
trips to Minsk or 'hunting escapades'. At the same time, Belarus expanded flights connecting to countries such as 
Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Dubai for no apparent reasons. Shortly after arriving in Minsk, migrants were provided with 
transportation to the border area with Lithuania. In place, Belarusian border guard agents served as 'point men'[5], 
providing details about the border, the best places to cross, and further instruction to avoid eventual control. On 17 
August 2021 Lithuania reported that Belarusian border guards crossed the border[6]. In 2020, the number of illegal 
Polish - Lithuanian - Belarusian Border Crisis and Ius ad Bellum Part I: Background and Key Findings
entries from Belarus into Lithuania was 74, while in the first eight months of 2021 Lithuania identified 3 836 
arrivals[7]. In October 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that it processed approximately 1289 
international protection applications with only two applicants receiving refugee status[8].  
Simultaneously in August 2021, the number of intercepted crossings skyrocketed at the Polish-Belarusian border. 
From 1 January 2021 to 11 November 2021, Poland reported 33 000 illegal crossings[9]. Poland responded by 
declaring a state of emergency at the frontier zone, the construction of barbed wire, and the redeployment of law 
enforcement and military forces. The most intense incident was reported on 8 November 2021, when a column of 
approximately 4 000 migrants marched to the Bruzhi-Kunica border crossing. The Belarusian military and police 
provided cutting tools, wooden logs, and stones[10]. Belarusian soldiers and border guards created a cordon 
around temporary camps of immigrants, firing in the air from time to time to force the migrants to cross the border. 
People gathered near the border of Belarus were not allowed to return to Belarus and there were reports of abuse if 
they tried to do so[11].  
By analyzing the above-mentioned facts, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1. The migrant crisis on the border between Lithauania-Belarus and Poland-Belarus is artificially created and fully 
orchestrated by the Lukaschenko regime, which conceals international migrant smuggling under the false pretext of 
'tourist activities'. The actions of Belarus could be classified as 'coercive engineered migrations'[12]. 
2. International law rigorously combats human trafficking. In 2000, alongside the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children[13]. The Protocol establishes an overall duty on 
the state parties to prevent trafficking (Art. 9). Under the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, 
and Air[14], supplementing the above-mentioned UN Convention, the state of Belarus must effectively prevent the 
smuggling of migrants (art. 2), including by criminalization of smuggling (art. 6), cooperation between states with 
common borders (art. 10) and other border measures (art. 11). Belarus has been a party to these treaties since 
2003. However, the Protocols are silent in regard to state-sponsored activities. The main 'purpose and objective' of 
these treaties is 'to prevent and combat' smuggling or trafficking. In order to achieve this goal, states must 
criminalize human trafficking or smuggling by correspondingly amending the state's national law. By default, the 
Protocols link the offences to individuals, not states per se. To put it simply, the Protocols do not directly address 
the activities of the state, which by actions conducted by its agents is involved in human trafficking or smuggling. 
Nevertheless, the obligations towards other states, especially to those which have a common border, might be 
deduced by invoking the provisions which are creating preventive duties, such as the commitment to exchange 
information (art. 10 of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air). Both Protocols contain 
a provision regarding the settlement of disputes, establishing a procedure with ultimately could trigger the 
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Poland and Belarus did not submit reservations to this provision. 
3. There are two goals of the operation[15]. The first one is retaliation: individually against Poland and Lithuania, 
collectively against the EU and NATO. The second is political: to force the West to recognize Lukashenko as the 
lawful ruler of Belarus and to end the sanctions imposed after the unrest in August 2020. Furthermore, on the 
suggestion of Sergei Lavror, the Russian Federation Foreign Minister, the EU 'could provide financial 
assistance[16]' to Belarus to stop illegal immigration, just as Turkey is receiving financial support under the 
agreement with the EU. 
4. On the ground, the operation is being directed by Belarusian secret services, border guards, soldiers, and 
policeman[17]. The agents of the Belarusian state provide the migrants with the tools for forced entry, 
transportation, instructions on how and when cross the border, intelligence and smuggling technics[18]. They also 
pressured the migrants to make an attempt to cross and denied them the possibility of returning. In November 
2021, there was also news regarding direct shipment of migrants between the Polish and Lithuanian borders[19], 
organized by the Belarusian military. 
5. On some occasions, there is the probability that Belarusian agents have crossed the international border. During 
the night between 1 and 2 November 2021, armed masked persons were spotted on the Polish side of the border. 
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested[20] against this intrusion. Also, as revealed in the news, there are 
reports stating that the Belarusian border guard special forces (OSAM) had infiltrated[21] the Polish territory as far 
back as 2020.  
6. Recently, it has been reported that Belarusian border guards directly demolished a section of the barbed wire 
fence (already installed in the Polish territory) and Polish troops were blinded by laser and stroboscope lights[22].

 By Mauldin Economics. Originally published at ValueWalk[1]. 
Are you scared? 
If so, you're not alone. Many investors are freaking out right now. 
The S&P 500 recently dropped to its lowest levels since September 2020. Many tech stocks have been cut in half 
over the past few months. 
I regularly chat with dozens of investors. From conversations I've had in the past week, I sense folks haven't been 
this worried since the onset of COVID-19[2]. 
  
  
Q4 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] 
But while much of the world panics, I see an opportunity to buy a specific group of stocks—a group that's still hated 
after last year's 'fakeout' 
I'll tell you all about it in a moment. First, let's rewind the clock 
Think back to the last time folks were this panicked 
Two years ago, COVID shut the world down. 
The pandemic decimated many industries. Among the worst-hit were travel[4] and tourism. 
Prior to COVID, roughly 2.5 million travelers passed through TSA checkpoints on any given day. That plunged 95% 
to 90,000 in April 2020. 
The Reopening Trade 
Remember the 'reopening trade' hype last summer? 
Last summer, the world wassupposedto reopen. With the arrival of vaccines[5], COVID was expected to go away 
quickly. 
We all know how that played out. 
The vaccine rollout in most countries took longer than expected. And new variants of COVID emerged—Delta and 
Omnicron—forcing people indoors once again. 
Canada didn't open its borders until last fall. America was closed to international travelers until November. 
Is It Time To Buy Travel Stocks?
You needed a vaccine passport to fly overseas yet most people didn't get their shots immediately. 
Even during the height of summer, tourist numbers only reached two-thirds of pre-COVID levels. 
Now, things are finally starting to turn around 
According to theNew York Times, more than 4.99 billion people have gotten at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. 
That's 65.1% of the world's population. 
And all across America, mask mandates are being lifted for vaccinated people. 
The world is truly opening up this time. 
Australia and New Zealand opened their borders last month. 
Ireland, where I live, just scrapped mask mandates[6]. Vaccine passports are a thing of the past in several 
European countries. 
Flown in the past few weeks? If so, you likely noticed airports are packed. TSA data shows passenger numbers are 
now 90%+ of pre-COVID levels. 
The number of Americans flying overseas jumped 130% compared to last year. 
Europe's largest airline, Ryanair, said it expects passenger numbers this summer to be 15% higher than 2019. 
On its latest earnings call, online travel agent Expedia forecasted something bolder:'Summer 2022 will be the 
busiest travel season ever.' 
Home-sharing pioneer Airbnb[7] revealed the number of nights booked on its platform jumped 25% compared to 
2019, ride-hailing giant Uber saw airport pickups triple year-over-year, and American Express achieved record 
earnings of the back of'stronger consumer travel spending.' 
Opportunity In Travel Stocks 
I know a boom when I see one 
It's not only one or two travel-related businesses putting up great numbers. 
Airlines, travel agents, hotels[8], taxis, and credit card firms are all telling you the same thing: travel is back in a big 
way. 
And this is just a taste of what's to come. Tourism won't just hit its pre-COVID 2019 peak 
It will surge to new highs.I'm 100% sure of this. 
Think about what makes you truly happy. 
I doubt it's that new car smell or a crisp $5,000 suit. It's experiences, like vacations with your family. Those are the 
things you remember for a lifetime. 
Most folks have been deprived of this joy for two years. I know people who haven't vacationed since 2019! They 
can't wait to hop on a plane this summer. 
Folks are sitting on thousands of dollars' worth of travel vouchers, and they're determined to make up for lost time. 
Mark my words, we'll see the strongest demand ever for vacations this year. 
Okay, Stephen what does this mean for my money? 
As I mentioned, many investors are panicking right now. 
US stocks dropped 14% this year to their lowest levels since September 2020. And despite the coming tourist 
boom, travel-related companies have gotten rocked too. 
Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG)collapsed 30% in just 13 trading days. It's now trading at the same levels it did 
when borders were shut, and nobody had a vaccine. 
Ditto for theUS Airline ETF (NYMARKET:JETS). Airline stocks have plunged to levels last seen in the summer of 
2020. 
This is a great buying opportunity.[9] 
Travel-related stocks have been hit by fears over a slowing economy and rising inflation. The thinking goes if folks 
are short on cash, they'll cancel their vacations. 
This is the big risk to investing in travel-related stocks, but it's a risk worth taking. 
Firstly, the market has already 'priced in' these risks. Many travel-related stocks have plunged 20%-30% in the past 
two weeks. They didn't even fall this hard when COVID hit! 
The market has jumped ahead of itself. A recession, no matter how bad, won't hurt travel as bad as COVID. 
Also, many folks aren't prepared to miss out on a vacation three years running. People will do anything they can to 
get away this year. 
Some are sitting on thousands of dollars' worth of travel vouchers, so vacations are essentially already paid for. 
I'll leave you with a final tip 
Sometimes in markets,it pays to be brave and make big calls[10]. This is one of those times. 
Is It Time To Buy Travel Stocks?
We're on the cusp of a travel boom. Nearly every travel business is showing us this. Yet, many of these stocks[11] 
are trading like we're still in the middle of the pandemic. 
This is your opportunity to scoop up shares in quality travel-related companies for a big discount.

Highlight: The new Terminal 2 (T2) at Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) in the German capital of Berlin is set to 
commence operations on 24 March.
Body
On that day, Irish carrier Ryanair will use the new terminal for the first departure. The main user of the new BER 
terminal will be Ryanair, which will carry out all of its departures from the new terminal in the following days. 
T2 will be used for maximum arrivals from Ryanair as well as some arrivals from other airlines, starting early April. 
With a total gross area of 23,000m², the new terminal will be able to accommodate up to six million passengers per 
annum. Designed to serve as a check-in building for departures and arrivals, the new terminal is linked to the 
departure gates in Terminal 1's Pier Nord through two bridges. A direct connection to TI and T2 is offered by the 
train station. Both terminals can equally use the multi-storey car parks at the airport. T2 comprises a check-in hall 
with multiple self-service kiosks. The first floor features modern security checkpoints while the plaza with shops and 
restaurants is located behind them. The digital display boards at the airport, as well as on the website and in the 
app will show whether the flight will take off or land at T1 or T2 for each flight. Last month, the EU approved a 
$1.9bn ((EURO)1.7bn) grant to Berlin Brandenburg Airport, affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and related travel 
restrictions.

Further UK and EU sanctions and export controls targeting Russia and Belarus

 UK DEVELOPMENTS 
Further designations On 10 March 2022, the UK Government added a further seven oligarchs to its list of sanctions 
targets, including the owner of Chelsea football club, Roman Abramovich. This was closely followed on 11 March 
2022 by the sanctioning of 386 members of the Russian Duma (comparable sanctions had already been imposed 
by the EU). 
Further aircraft-related sanctions Airport operators, air traffic controllers and the Secretary of State have been 
granted new powers to issue directions to Russian aircraft (e.g., to take off, not to take off, and to land) and to 
suspend and revoke permissions needed to operate. The new provisions also allow the detention and movement of 
Russian aircraft and prohibit a person from providing aircraft insurance or reinsurance services to a person 
connected with Russia or where the aircraft is for use in Russia. 
Under the regulation, a 'Russian aircraft' is a Russian-registered aircraft, or one that is owned, chartered or 
operated by a person subject to UK sanctions, or who is otherwise connected with Russia. A person 'connected 
with Russia' includes individuals who are ordinarily resident in Russia, or located in Russia, as well as entities that 
are incorporated under the laws of Russia or domiciled in Russia. 
Criminal offences are committed by operators and/or pilots of Russian aircraft that fail to comply with directions 
issued, or otherwise overfly, or land on, the UK without authorization. 
New general licenses There have been a number of new general licenses issued by the Office of Financial 
Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). These include: 
 A general license that permits the winding down of activities relating to Sberbank until April 3, 2022; A general 
license that permits the winding down of activities relating to Bank Otkritie, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, 
Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB), and Novikombank until April 3, 2022; A general license that allows for the 
provision of aeronautical information publication data by Belaeronavigatsia (the state owned air navigation service 
in Belarus which has been under UK and EU sanctions since the June grounding of a Ryanair flight to Minsk in 
Belarus that allowed for the arrest of a journalist and his companion) to air traffic management services and data 
providers in the UK (and a corresponding payment for such services); and A general license relating to the 
continued operation of Chelsea Football Club following the designation of its owner, Roman Abramovich. 
Further UK and EU sanctions and export controls targeting Russia and Belarus
A general trade license has also been issued by the Department for International Trade in relation to the provision 
of insurance or reinsurance services to Russian aircraft, allowing for providers to wind down activities until March 
28, 2022, in certain circumstances. 
In a further development, Belarus has now been removed from nine open general export licenses. 
Phase-out of Russian oil The UK Business Secretary announced that the UK will phase out imports of Russian oil 
by the end of the year. 
Economic Crime Bill The Economic Crime Bill (which includes provisions intended to make implementing sanctions 
against individuals easier and less risky for the Government if challenged) has passed through the UK House of 
Commons and is now progressing through the House of Lords. If passed, amendments added to the Bill would 
permit persons to be sanctioned in an 'urgent procedure' where they are subject to similar sanctions in the U.S., 
EU, or other specified jurisdictions. 
The draft Bill also proposes to implement a limit on the amount of damages a court may award if the Government is 
found to have acted in bad faith. 
EU developments On March 9, 2022, the EU passed a number of new amending regulations, imposing additional 
sanctions on Russia and Belarus. The new measures: 
 Designate a further 160 individuals who are now subject to individual restrictions and asset freezes; Amend the 
current sanctions on Belarus to bring them in line with those imposed on Russia; Block three Belarussian banks 
from SWIFT, namely: Belagroprombank, Bank Dabrabyt, and the Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus (as 
well as their Belarusian subsidiaries); Prohibit transactions relating to the management of reserves or assets of the 
Central Bank of Belarus; and Restrict the export of maritime navigation and radio communication technology to 
Russia and restrict the ability of the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping to raise finance. 
Notably, the new EU regulations did not include an EU-wide ban on Russian ships docking in Member States' ports. 
A number of sources have reported that the EU has proposed implementing such a prohibition but as yet the 
relevant regulation has not been published. 
Further, on March 11, 2022, the President of the European Commission announced that the EU would shortly 
introduce a further raft of sanctions against Russia, including: 
 Suspending its privileged trade and economic treatment; Prohibitions on the use of cryptoassets to circumvent 
current measures; Banning exports to Russia of luxury goods; and Banning imports from Russia of iron and steel 
goods. 
The relevant legal instruments relating to the above are yet to be published.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has made good on its threats to cut 19 routes from Lisbon this summer following delays in 
the release of unused airport slots by TAP Air Portugal (TP, Lisbon).
"Our last effort to request help from [Portugal's] Prime Minister [António] Costa has fallen on deaf ears with zero 
reply. Sadly, Ryanair is now forced to reduce its fleet of aircraft from seven to four in Lisbon in Summer 2022, a loss 
of 150 highly paid aviation jobs, over 900,000 fewer passengers, and over EUR250 million euros (USD276 million) 
in lost tourism revenues for the city of Lisbon this summer," announced Ryanair's Group Chief Executive Officer, 
Michael O'Leary. "The loss of these 19 Lisbon routes and 5,000 flights this Summer means that Lisbon's post-Covid 
recovery will now lag behind other major EU capital cities," he said.
"These avoidable cancellations come after multiple attempts by Ryanair to request the Portuguese government to 
intervene to release these unused TAP S22 slots," he added.
Ryanair's hopes for a slot transfer in time for the summer season were quashed recently when it became clear that 
18 available TAP slots would likely only be transferred in October to a winning bidder following a tender process 
that has only just started. A call for tenders went out on February 25. The European Commission is only expected 
to decide on the winning airline in June 2022.
Brussels in December last year determined that TAP would make 18 slots available, free of charge, in exchange for 
receiving EUR2.55 billion (USD2.85 billion) in restructuring aid from the Portuguese government.
Meanwhile, Ryanair said its three aircraft and 19 routes would return to Lisbon in October 2022 as it would then 
have sufficient slots for its reduced winter schedule.
The 19 routes affected this summer are:
Agadir and Oujda (Morocco);
Alghero, Bari, and Palermo (Italy);
Alicante, Lanzarote, Madrid Barajas, Tenerife, and Zaragoza (Spain);
Billund (Denmark;)
Ryanair makes good on threat to withdraw Lisbon slots
Birmingham Int'l and Bournemouth (United Kingdom;)

After surviving pandemic chaos, the biggest airlines are facing a new crisis before the last one is even over.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent the price of oil to a 14-year high and set off unprecedented flight bans. 
Investors have taken fright.
"We have dealt with the pestilence, only to be visited with a war," said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. "I 
think it's going to be very difficult for most airlines for the next 12 months."
Airlines are used to dealing with geopolitical shocks, and executives and analysts think demand for flying is strong 
enough to help passenger numbers recover from Covid.
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine comes at a critical time. It threatens to hit demand for flying, testing the fragile 
balance sheets of carriers and delaying the return to profits after the industry accumulated an estimated £200bn of 
pandemic losses.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said the company faced "another challenge" from the "unimaginable 
events", as the airline last week warned over uncertainty stemming from the conflict.

balance sheets and hinders return to profit
"We're looking at a delay or somewhat of an interim setback in the airline path to financial recovery," said Philip 
Baggaley, a managing director at S&P Global.
The immediate problem is the soaring price of crude, which has risen as high as $139 per barrel, at a time of 
broader inflationary pressures. Fuel can represent up to 35 per cent of airline operating costs, according to Scope 
Ratings, and several carriers in Europe changed their hedging policies after being stung by a collapse in the price of 
oil and demand for flying in 2020.
Wizz Air stopped hedging, leaving it exposed as it builds up its schedules this year. Its stock has fallen nearly 50 
per cent since mid-February to its lowest level in 18 months. The airline on Monday reversed course and 
announced it had entered into fuel hedges for the next four months.
Ryanair is nearly fully hedged this year at $65 per barrel, while British Airways owner IAG has hedges in place at 
between $60 and $73 per barrel for the next 18 months, according to analysts at Raymond James.
In the US, many airlines that were hedging had pulled back over the past five years because "the industry has 
become consolidated enough that the airlines have more pricing power", said Baggaley.
Only Southwest and Alaska Airlines hedge fuel, giving them more of a cushion than the country's three biggest 
carriers, American, United and Delta. Southwest is 64 per cent hedged and Alaska has hedged up to half of 
estimated fuel consumption for 2022.
High fuel costs do not always hit airline profits. Steve Gunning, chief financial officer of International Airlines Group, 
noted that the company reached operating profit margins of 14.4 per cent when oil was last at $100 per barrel.
But analysts question whether airlines will be able to pass the costs on to customers at a time of fragile demand 
outside peak periods. Higher household energy prices could also damage con- sumer confidence and spending 
power.
Raising ticket costs in response to high oil prices will be insufficient for US airlines. They would have to cut capacity 
during off-peak periods, said Savanthi Syth, a managing director at Raymond James. With demand not fully back, 
"it is tougher to absorb these kind[s] of fuel shocks".
Another problem is tit-for-tat bans. Aeroflot is barred from almost all of European and North American skies, while 
European airlines are no longer able to take northerly shortcuts across Russia to reach Asia, forcing them to burn 
more fuel.
Investors wiped a fifth off Finnair's market value last week after it warned its flights to Asia were unviable without 
crossing Russia, sending them into talks with the government over assistance.
"The situation has a considerable impact ... Finnair is currently preparing new traffic and cost savings plans in case 
the situation prolongs," chief executive Topi Manner said.
The carrier has since restarted some routes on longer flight paths.
For many airlines, the situation is tempered by routes to Asia having been slowest to recover because of travel 
curbs in the region.
"The places we fly to over Russian airspace, we are not really serving at the minute. We are able to reroute our 
network," British Airways boss Sean Doyle said last week.
But beyond the short term, carriers face longer, more expensive trips to growing markets including China and India. 
And when markets do reopen, Gulf carriers could have a competitive advantage because of their southerly flight 
patterns.
Pandemic-weary carriers fly into fresh turmoil Airlines. Demand threat Ukraine shock is a severe test for fragile 
balance sheets and hinders return to profit
Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, said that more popular routes could also be hit with overcapacity if airlines 
shifted resources from Asia.
"A decade ago, we had profit warnings on transatlantic flights when Asian markets were weak."
The key to future health and the perhaps biggest unknown is what the war will do to consumer confidence and 
demand for flying. Lufthansa and Ryanair both reported a slowdown in ticket sales when the war broke out, though 
O'Leary hopes it is a blip.
"When conflict arises in the world, we see slower demand. But I cannot quantify that reduction yet," Spohr said.
Several industry figures recall the first Gulf war when US tourist numbers to Europe fell.
In the latest crisis, domestic and short-haul-focused airlines are likely to cope best, while long-haul carriers, which 
suffered the most during the pandemic, are more exposed.
"It is not going to stop Brits going to Málaga this summer, I don't think. But might Americans not want to go to Berlin, 
for example?" Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, said.

After surviving pandemic chaos, the biggest airlines are facing a new crisis before the last one is even over.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent the price of oil to a 14-year high and set off unprecedented flight bans. 
Investors have taken fright.
"We have dealt with the pestilence, only to be visited with a war," said Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. "I 
think it's going to be very difficult for most airlines for the next 12 months."
Airlines are used to dealing with geopolitical shocks, and executives and analysts think demand for flying is strong 
enough to help passenger numbers recover from Covid.
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine comes at a critical time. It threatens to hit demand for flying, testing the fragile 
balance sheets of carriers and delaying the return to profits after the industry accumulated an estimated £200bn of 
pandemic losses.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said the company faced "another challenge" from the "unimaginable 
events", as the airline last week warned over uncertainty stemming from the conflict.
Pandemic-weary carriers fly into fresh turmoil Airlines. Demand threat Ukraine shock is a severe test for fragile 
balance sheets and hinders return to profit
"We're looking at a delay or somewhat of an interim setback in the airline path to financial recovery," said Philip 
Baggaley, a managing director at S&P Global.
The immediate problem is the soaring price of crude, which has risen as high as $139 per barrel, at a time of 
broader inflationary pressures. Fuel can represent up to 35 per cent of airline operating costs, according to Scope 
Ratings, and several carriers in Europe changed their hedging policies after being stung by a collapse in the price of 
oil and demand for flying in 2020.
Wizz Air stopped hedging, leaving it exposed as it builds up its schedules this year. Its stock has fallen nearly 50 
per cent since mid-February to its lowest level in 18 months. The airline on Monday reversed course and 
announced it had entered into fuel hedges for the next four months.
Ryanair is nearly fully hedged this year at $65 per barrel, while British Airways owner IAG has hedges in place at 
between $60 and $73 per barrel for the next 18 months, according to analysts at Raymond James.
In the US, many airlines that were hedging had pulled back over the past five years because "the industry has 
become consolidated enough that the airlines have more pricing power", said Baggaley.
Only Southwest and Alaska Airlines hedge fuel, giving them more of a cushion than the country's three biggest 
carriers, American, United and Delta. Southwest is 64 per cent hedged and Alaska has hedged up to half of 
estimated fuel consumption for 2022.
High fuel costs do not always hit airline profits. Steve Gunning, chief financial officer of International Airlines Group, 
noted that the company reached operating profit margins of 14.4 per cent when oil was last at $100 per barrel.
But analysts question whether airlines will be able to pass the costs on to customers at a time of fragile demand 
outside peak periods. Higher household energy prices could also damage con- sumer confidence and spending 
power.
Raising ticket costs in response to high oil prices will be insufficient for US airlines. They would have to cut capacity 
during off-peak periods, said Savanthi Syth, a managing director at Raymond James. With demand not fully back, 
"it is tougher to absorb these kind[s] of fuel shocks".
Another problem is tit-for-tat bans. Aeroflot is barred from almost all of European and North American skies, while 
European airlines are no longer able to take northerly shortcuts across Russia to reach Asia, forcing them to burn 
more fuel.
Investors wiped a fifth off Finnair's market value last week after it warned its flights to Asia were unviable without 
crossing Russia, sending them into talks with the government over assistance.
"The situation has a considerable impact ... Finnair is currently preparing new traffic and cost savings plans in case 
the situation prolongs," chief executive Topi Manner said.
The carrier has since restarted some routes on longer flight paths.
For many airlines, the situation is tempered by routes to Asia having been slowest to recover because of travel 
curbs in the region.
"The places we fly to over Russian airspace, we are not really serving at the minute. We are able to reroute our 
network," British Airways boss Sean Doyle said last week.
But beyond the short term, carriers face longer, more expensive trips to growing markets including China and India. 
And when markets do reopen, Gulf carriers could have a competitive advantage because of their southerly flight 
patterns.
Pandemic-weary carriers fly into fresh turmoil Airlines. Demand threat Ukraine shock is a severe test for fragile 
balance sheets and hinders return to profit
Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, said that more popular routes could also be hit with overcapacity if airlines 
shifted resources from Asia.
"A decade ago, we had profit warnings on transatlantic flights when Asian markets were weak."
The key to future health and the perhaps biggest unknown is what the war will do to consumer confidence and 
demand for flying. Lufthansa and Ryanair both reported a slowdown in ticket sales when the war broke out, though 
O'Leary hopes it is a blip.
"When conflict arises in the world, we see slower demand. But I cannot quantify that reduction yet," Spohr said.
Several industry figures recall the first Gulf war when US tourist numbers to Europe fell.
In the latest crisis, domestic and short-haul-focused airlines are likely to cope best, while long-haul carriers, which 
suffered the most during the pandemic, are more exposed.
"It is not going to stop Brits going to Málaga this summer, I don't think. But might Americans not want to go to Berlin, 
for example?" Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy, said.

RYANAIR yesterday said it was forced to slash 5,000 flights to Lisbon after Portuguese flag carrier Tap held on its 
unused slots.
"We deeply regret all these unnecessary disruptions to passengers on these cancelled flights and the loss of 19 
routes solely by Tap's blocking of unused Lisbon Portela slots in summer 2022," said chief exec Michael O'Leary.
The Ryanair boss said the airline had made multiple attempts with Lisbon's government to no avail.
The comments have revived a longstanding feud between Ryanair and legacy carriers, who have been accused of 
"blocking their slots" to protect themselves from competition.

Bot calls out firms over gender pay gap

 British companies posting messages for International Women's Day are having their gender pay gaps exposed by 
a Twitter bot, leading some to delete their posts. 
Companies such as Ryanair, Barclays and outsourcer Capita, as well as universities and government departments, 
have been called out by the Gender Pay Gap Bot, which states in its Twitter biography: 'Employers, if you tweet 
about International Women's Day, I'll retweet your gender pay gap.' 
The cover photograph on the account reads: 'Deeds not words. Stop posting platitudes. Start fixing the problem.' 
When a firm posts a tweet that contains any International Women's Day hashtags, the bot automatically responds 
with its median gender pay gap, which is calculated using openly available data from the government. The worst 
offenders include Young's pubs and Ryanair, where women are paid a median of 73.2 and 68.6 per cent less than 
men, respectively. 
Other British organisations mentioned are travel group Tui UK, with a gap of 41.7 per cent; the government agency 
Innovate UK, with a pay gap of 36 per cent; Barclays Bank with 34.5 per cent; and Capita at 33.2 per cent. 
Some companies outed by the bot use messages of female empowerment in their marketing, including the fashion 
retailer Missguided, which pays women 40 per cent less than men. HM Revenue & Customs, the Department for 
Environment and the House of Lords - with pay gaps of 8.8, 6.8 and 5.1 per cent - were also exposed by the bot, 
whose data caused many organisations, such as Innovate UK, HMRC and Exeter University, to delete their initial 
posts — with many reposting later in the day. 
Innovate UK's now-deleted post also spotlighted '38 inspiring women and their ideas', yet featured a photo of its 
chief executive, Indro Mukerjee, who is a man. 
While many companies fell short of expectations, a handful did pay employees equally. Those leading the way 
include the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, St John's Ambulance and Registers of Scotland. 
The London Fire Brigade even pays women 2.7 per cent more than men. 
The account was created last year by social media manager Francesca Lawson and software developer Ali 
Fensome.

Ryanair and Wizz Air continue to lead European aviation's recovery, but other leading groups are becoming more 
bullish. In the week commencing 21-Feb-2022 Ryanair had 104% of its 2019 seats. It is the only European top 10 
airline group by seats that is ahead of 2019 capacity. Wizz Air, on 83%, had the second highest percentage. Europe 
as a whole is on 69%; the top 10 groups are collectively at 72%.
Europe's 31.1% capacity shortfall to 2019 levels keeps it at the bottom of the regional ranking, but it is very close to 
Asia Pacific, where capacity is down by 30.6%. Middle East capacity is down by 26.9%, Africa by 20.3%, Latin 
America by 12.8%, and North America by 12.3%.
Schedules for the last week of Jul-2022 project total Europe capacity at 93% of 2019 levels, with the top 10 groups 
collectively at 103%. Wizz Air plans to surge to 159%, and Ryanair is projected at 117%. Turkish Airlines, SAS, Air 
France-KLM and easyJet also plan 100% or more of their 2019 capacity levels by late Jul-2022. Lufthansa Group, 
at 89%, is most cautious among the leading groups.
President Putin's disastrous invasion of Ukraine will not help in any regrowth. And the cost impact of fuel prices with 
oil now over USD100 per barrel is also unwelcome.

SOME airlines could see their postpandemic recovery badly affected by the ongoing increase in oil prices.
Prices yesterday hit $130 per barrel - the highest since 2008 - and are expected to directly impact ticket fares.
"Fuel accounts for between 35 and 40 per cent of an airline's operating costs, it is inevitable that the increased 
costs will eventually trickle down to passengers," aviation analyst Alex Macheras told City A.M.
Airlines who hedged out about 80 per cent of their fuel needs - such as Ryanair - will be able to maintain low fares 
this summer, but prices will eventually be pushed up, he added.
Wizz Air has currently capped fuel exposure with zero hedges, while Easyjet has hedged out 60 per cent.

European airlines are expected to reap rewards and pay for poor planning in equal measure as hedging strategies 
come to the fore amid unprecedented challenges for the sector.
While fuel hedges meant losses for airlines during the Covid pandemic, the decision to hedge for 2022 is expected 
to pay dividends against rising oil prices as Russia's invasion of Ukraine looks increasingly likely to cause long-term 
headwinds.
Insecure supply, recovering passenger numbers and the requirement to extend some journeys to avoid Ukrainian 
air space meant fuel pressures were expected to leap for companies this year.
According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the average global price for jet fuel per metric tonne 
was US$877.57 on 25 February, and US$875.13 in Europe, both around a 60% rise on prices last year.
Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ)'s share price fell more than 13% at one point in morning trading as it notified 
investors that it had not hedged against rising oil prices which it spotted at US$1300m/t on 7 March, capping its fuel 
cost exposure at US$1172mt.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA)s costs were almost fully hedged for the fourth quarter of 2022, with 80% of costs 
hedged out to 2023, with 60% jet swaps at US$620 per metric tonne and 20% caps at US$715m/t, while the second 
half of 2023 saw a 70% hedge at $640m/t.
Hedging strategies in spotlight as airlines fight new fires
British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) hedged 70% for the first quarter of 2022 
and 60% for the financial year 2022, at $900m/t through 2022, its chief executive Luis Gallego said on 25 February, 
leaving 40% exposed.
easyJet plc (LSE:EZJ) was was also 60% hedged for fuel for its financial year ending 30 September at US$540m/t.
Jet2 PLC (AIM:JET2), which lost £108.4mln in 2020 through fuel hedging ineffectiveness, has not yet disclosed the 
price at which it hedged jet fuel for 2022, nor has TUI AG (LSE:TUI).

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary took aim at the EU, Angela Merkel, Heathrow Airport and Boeing in an 
extraordinary press conference in central London yesterday.
The talkative aviation supremo also predicted that the Ukraine conflict would send long-haul costs up.
"We think long-haul will not be an option and Asia will certainly be more expensive and harder to get to because of 
the no-fly zones over Russia, Ukraine and Belarus," he said during a press conference. "We think families and 
people will return to the beaches of Europe - Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy - and we're trying to capitalise on 
that, carrying many more passengers at lower fares."
The airline, which was forced last Thursday to halt all Ukraine operations following Moscow's offensive, said the 
conflict will not have a huge impact on bookings as long as it doesn't spill over to other countries.
Ryanair said bookings dropped 20 per cent after the invasion broke out but that numbers had recovered over the 
weekend, standing at nine per cent below expectations on Tuesday.
"If nothing untoward happens, I expect [bookings] will be back to normal by next week."
The carrier, which was Ukraine's biggest airline until Thursday, said it will be back as soon as it is safe.
"We do not believe it will be possible to fly over Ukraine for the foreseeable future," O'Leary told journalists.
"We will be the first to return to flying into Ukraine once it's safe to do so but I suspect it will probably [be] the 
summer or maybe next winter."
O'Leary: Ryanair will be the first back in Ukraine
O'Leary said Ryanair was keeping
Ukraine flight costs as low as possible and delivering humanitarian aid.

Mar 03, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, the ban imposed by the U.S. government on Russian carriers by closing down its airspace 
following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia dominated headlines. However, even before the announcement was 
made on Mar 1, Delta Air Lines DAL[1] and American Airlines AAL[2] had already suspended their partnerships with 
the respective Russian carriers. United Airlines UAL[3] too followed suit by temporarily suspending flights over the 
Russian airspace. 
In other news, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] reported impressive traffic numbers for February on the back of upbeat 
air-travel demand. Expansion-related updates were available from United Airlines and Spirit Airlines SAVE[5] in the 
previous week. 
Read the last Airline roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold),is set to resume San Francisco-Melbourne (Australia) flights on May 7. The service remained 
suspended for long due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. 
Throughout the pandemic, United Airlines had maintained its passenger service to Australia. UAL offers the 
maximum number of flights to Australia among all U.S. carriers, management had said earlier[7]. You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. Spirit Airlines launched a service from Orlando International Airport (MCO) to Mercedita International Airport 
(PSE) in Ponce. The move expands its presence in Puerto Rico. This daily nonstop service complements Spirit 
Airlines' existing operations in San Juan (SJU) and Aguadilla (BQN) in Puerto Rico. From Orlando, FL, SAVE 
operates around 80 flights each day, providing one-stop options between PSE and 28 cities across its route map[9]. 
3. Despite omicron-led woes, Ryanair's traffic in February 2022 surged more than 100% year over year to 8.7

Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months.

The table above shows that almost airline stocks traded in the red over the past week mainly due to the upsurge in 
oil price. We note that even before the Russia-Ukraine crisis emanated, oil price was witnessing a spike. Russia's 
launch of military operations in Ukraine skyrocketed the commodity price further (currently trading above $100 a 
barrel). 
The upsurge is reflective of the concerns about oil supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest 
producers of the commodity. Such escalation in oil price does not bode well for airlines' bottom line as fuel 
expenses represent one of the largest input costs for these operators. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
decreased 6.2% to $78.49 over the past week. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index declined 15%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for further updates on the impact on airlines as 
the Russia-Ukraine tension increases.

European Airlines are trying to negotiate access to and out of Ukrainian airspace as the country enters deeper 
turmoil following last week's invasion by Russia.
Airspace is closed to commercial airlines over Ukraine, as well as parts of Russia and Moldova, with Wizz Air 
Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) among the groups trying to mitigate the impacts 
to Ukraine business, while also try to provide aid.
Hungary-based airline Wizz, the only EU airline to have bases and aircraft based in Ukraine, has prepared an 
evacuation plan for its assets.
"In this very concerning situation we have been focused on helping our colleagues and their families in Ukraine, to 
move to places of safety," said Wizz Air chief executive József Váradi.
"I am incredibly proud of how our people have stepped up and worked around the clock to try to provide the best 
support at this difficult time."
Wizz Air said it expects 7% of its network to be impacted by the fallout of the invasion, with February seeing 2% of 
its network affected.
Meanwhile, Ryanair is looking ahead to a time when it can resume operations in the country, as its chief said it was 
providing humanitarian aid to the country in its planes.
Airlines sweat on Ukraine links
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary told the Guardian that Ryaniar had planned to fly 2mln people to four 
airports in Ukraine this year, with plans to expand prior to the invasion.
"We will be the first airline to return to Ukraine when it is safe to do so ... but I suspect it will take until next winter, 
when hopefully the Ukrainians will have seen off the Russians and sent them back to where they came from," 
O'Leary said.
O'Leary said the company had seen a surge of bookings to Ukraine's neighbour Ukraine, as family members try to 
reunite with Ukrainian refugees close to the border.
Ryanair's share price is down 17.4% in the last five days to close at US$88.99 yesterday, while Wizz Air is down 
9.1% to 3,025p.

Ryanair CEO says greater Western oil production will hit Russia hard

The chief executive of budget airline Ryanair has said that the most effective way to target Russia amid its ongoing 
onslaught of Ukraine is to ramp up oil production in the West.
Speaking to Sky News Wednesday, Michael O'Leary said that Russia - one of the world's largest energy producers 
- is benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices as supply fears bite in an already tight market.
Further production from Western countries would reduce their reliance on Russia - particularly in Europe, which 
derives 40% of its oil and gas from the country - and weaken the energy markets on which Russia's economy 
strongly depends.
"The most important thing that we in the West can do is drive up oil production, because what hits Russia hardest is 
low oil prices and low gas prices," O'Leary said.
Russia's economy has already been hard hit by Western sanctions, with markets slipping into freefall and the 
Russian ruble tumbling almost 30% against the dollar. But so far it has done little to deter President Vladimir Putin's 
resolve to seize control of Ukraine.
Global energy markets, meanwhile, have rallied amid concerns over further disruption to the oil and gas pipelines 
which carry Russian products through Ukraine, and some have accused Putin of trying to weaponize the West's 
reliance on its hefty energy supplies.
U.S. oil climbed to the highest level in more than a decade in Wednesday trade, with global benchmark Brent 
topping $111 per barrel as crude's blistering rally continues.
O'Leary, whose budget airline business is heavily exposed to energy costs, said his company was able to absorb 
further energy price hikes into 2023 without passing on costs to consumers.
"We have hedged out about 80% of our fuel needs out to March 2023. So for this summer, and for the rest of this 
year, we'll still be able to pass on low oil prices and low fares to our customers because we have a very strong fuel 
hedging position," he told Sky News.
However, he noted that the coming 12 months are likely to be "very difficult for most airlines," especially as they vie 
to recoup losses endured during two years of Covid-induced travel restrictions.
Ryanair CEO says greater Western oil production will hit Russia hard
OPEC and its oil-producing allies, including Russia, are due to meet Wednesday to discuss April's energy output.
It follows a meeting Monday of the International Energy Agency, which includes the United States and Japan, 
where members agreed to release 60 million barrels of crude from their reserves to try to quell the sharp increase in 
prices.

EU member states reach agreement for new Belarus sanctions

EU member states agreed new sanctions on Belarus, Russia's ally in the invasion of Ukraine, the French 
presidency of the European Council announced on Wednesday on Twitter.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sunday new sanctions on Belarus, "the 
other aggressor" in the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia launched offensives against Ukraine from Belarus which borders the country to the north. Minsk's 
strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko is considered an ally and military supporter of Kremlin leader Vladimir 
Putin.
Von der Leyen said the measures are to target Belarus' most important export products such as minerals, fuels, 
tobacco, wood, cement, iron and steel.
Personal sanctions are also to target Belarusian officials that support Russia's invasion, von der Leyen said.
The sanctions package is to enter into force as soon as the measures are published in the EU Official Journal 
according to France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
The EU already enacted far-reaching sanctions targeting Belarus last year because of Lukashenko's repression of 
civil society, the forced rerouting of a Ryanair plane and the orchestration of a migrant crisis on the bloc's border.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine will not have a dramatic impact on airline bookings in eastern Europe so long as the 
war does not escalate and spread, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday.
Asked about the impact of the war on demand to fly to and around eastern Europe, O'Leary told reporters: "I think 
you will not have a dramatic impact on bookings as long as the period of war doesn't escalate and spread 
elsewhere."
O'Leary said that industry short-haul capacity would be down around 10% this summer, driving higher fares, adding 
that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.

December, January and February was "badly affected" by Omicron-related travel restrictions. It operated 53,660

Tenders open for TAP's slots at Lisbon, Portugal
Tenders open for TAP's slots at Lisbon, Portugal

Expressions of interest have been invited from interested airlines for 18 daily slots at Lisbon belonging to TAP Air 
Portugal (TP, Lisbon) with a decision scheduled for June 2022. Still, the successful carrier will only be able to use 
them for the 2022 winter.
The European Commission in December 2021 granted permission to Portugal to provide EUR2.55 billion euros 
(USD2.85 billion) in restructuring aid to TAP on condition that another airline receives up to 18 daily slots, free of 
charge, to establish a new base or expand an existing base at Lisbon airport to safeguard free competition.
The call for tenders was published on February 25 by Berlin-based management consultants Alcis Advisers, 
appointed by Brussels as monitoring trustees to oversee the implementation of Portugal's commitments.
However, any hope by the likes of Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) for a speedy slot transfer may be frustrated by the 
proposed schedule, which will see the successful bidder start using the transferred slots earliest on October 30, 
2022, at the start of the 2022/2023 IATA winter season.
The Irish budget carrier has been cranking up the pressure on TAP to make the slots available by the end of 
February. It has threatened to cancel 20 routes from Lisbon this summer and reduce the number of its aircraft 
stationed there unless TAP releases its unused slots by the end of the month.
According to guidelines published by Alcis Advisers, TAP will have to make slots available that correspond within 20 
minutes for short-haul and 60 minutes for long-haul flights to the slot times requested by the competitor. If TAP 
does not have slots within the relevant time window, it will transfer slots closest to the time requested. The arrival 
and departure slot times will be such as to allow for reasonable aircraft rotation by the competitor.
TAP will not be obliged to transfer:
More than one slot before 0800L (0800Z) per aircraft;
More than half of the total remedy slots before 1200L (1200Z);
More slots before 2000L (2000Z) than the total remedy slots minus one slot per aircraft for short-haul flights.
Tenders open for TAP's slots at Lisbon, Portugal
If no airline is selected to receive the slots, Alcis Advice will issue another call for proposals ahead of the general 
slot allocation procedure for Summer 2023. Subsequent tender processes could be called until the total number of 
slots have been transferred at the latest by December 31, 2025.
The European Commission will assess all proposals. This process will follow two stages:
Air carriers must submit expressions of interest within specific qualifying criteria by March 24, 2022;
Qualifying candidates must submit their full proposals by May 12, 2022.
To qualify, interested airlines must:
hold a valid Operating License (OL) issued by a European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA)- member 
state, and be unconnected to TAP;
may not have received COVID-19 recapitalisation of more than EUR250 million (USD280 million);
must commit to operating the number of aircraft proposed at Lisbon until the end of 2025.
Amongst other things, the EC will give preference to airlines that offer:
the largest seat capacity of Lisbon-based aircraft until the end of 2025; and
serve the greatest number of destinations from Lisbon with direct flights until the end of 2025.
Interestingly, should there be tied bids, Brussels will give preference to the proposal best ranked by TAP - which 
may use any criteria of its choice, provided that they are transparent.
The Commission intends to make a decision by the week of June 13, 2022, whereafter the consultants will issue a 
Request for Confirmation from the potential winner. TAP will submit a draft slot transfer agreement to the highest-
ranked bidder in the week of June 20, 2022, with the signing of the agreement slated for the week of June 25, 2022. 
"The final slot transfer agreement shall be signed within six weeks after the [June 13] Request for Confirmation, 
save in case of a postponement explicitly approved by TAP Air Portugal and the remedy taker", the guidelines said.

EU airlines' shares tumble following airspace closure and Russia reaction
EU airlines' shares tumble following airspace closure and Russia reaction

THE SHARES of major European airlines yesterday took a tumble following the EU's decision to close its airspace 
to Russia.
Legacy carriers registered a slump, with British Airways' owner IAG dropping 3.86 per cent, while German carrier 
Lufthansa registered a 4.34 per cent fall. Share of aviation colossus Air France-KLM went down 2.35 per cent but 
the most impacted was Helsinki-based Finnair who sank 21.09 per cent as it no longer will be able to fly over 
Russia, as the Kremlin closed its airspace yesterday.
Francesco Ragni, aviation professor at Buckinghamshire New University, believes the move will make flying 
between Europe and Asia more expensive and difficult.
"This will harm mostly carriers like KLM, Lufthansa or Finnair that fly a lot of routes to Asia and are geographically 
positioned near Russia," he told City A.M.
"Some routes will become impossible or unfeasible to fly."
Long-haul carriers were not the only ones to suffer, as Easyjet's shares closed down 3.77 per cent, while Ryanair 
and Wizz Air fell 2.33 and 4.84 per cent respectively.
According to Susannah Streeter, Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment and market analyst, higher fuel cost 
will also become an issue. "The fear is that prices will head up much higher if Russia retaliates to sanctions and 
weaponises oil, limiting supplies."

US-based Sun Country Airlines has added a pair of mid-life Boeing 737NG aircraft to its fleet, according to 
regulatory documents.
The Minneapolis-headquartered carrier has taken a 2014-vintage 737-800 aircraft previously operated by Tuifly. 
Sun Country has also received a 2002-vintage 737-700 aircraft previously operated by Gol Linas Aereas.
According to its fleet plan, Sun Country plans to acquire 15 737-800 aircraft by the end of next year.
The carrier operates 36 passenger and 12 freighter aircraft, according to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker. It 
recently leased a 737-800 aircraft from CDB Aviation as part of a two-aircraft transaction.
Its passenger fleet will grow to 50 units by the end of 2023.
The carrier says the focus is on the 737-800, "the LCC stalwart for airlines such as Southwest and Ryanair", adding 
that Covid has created "unique opportunities" to acquire mid-life aircraft at even cheaper rates.

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) plans to extract as soon as possible four of its A320-200s trapped in Ukraine following the 
closure of the country's airspace to all civilian flights following the Russian invasion.
"We will be evacuating, at the earliest opportunity, the four aircraft (three in Kyiv and one in Lviv) we have based on 
the ground," a Wizz Air spokesperson confirmed to ch-aviation.
According to Flightradar24 ADS-B data, three Wizz Air A320-200s are stuck at Kyiv Igor Sikorsky. They are HA-
LWY (msn 6058) which had arrived on February 23 from Milan Malpensa (Italy); HA-LPJ (msn 3127) from Hamburg 
Helmut Schmidt (Germany); and HA-LPM (msn 3177) from Budapest (Hungary). Another A320-200, HA-LWS (msn 
5608), is grounded at Lviv.
"The safety and security of our passengers and crew remain our number one priority and we hope normality will 
return to Ukraine soon," Wizz Air said in a statement.
Budget carriers Wizz Air and Ryanair and several other airlines have announced the temporary suspension of all 
flight operations to/from the Ukraine due to the closure of its airspace following the Russian attack.
Wizz Air has cancelled at least 20 flights from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, since February 24, including to Wroclaw, 
Gdansk, and Warsaw Chopin (Poland), Berlin Brandenburg Int'l, Dortmund, Cologne/Bonn, Memmingen, and 
Hamburg (Germany), Tallinn Lennart Meri (Estonia), Larnaca (Cyprus),Bratislava (Slovakia), Athens Int'l (Greece), 
Budapest (Hungary), Vienna (Austria), Riga (Latvia), Rome Fiumicino (Italy), Copenhagen Kastrup and Billund

27015041011), and a Jonika Airlines (JO, Kyiv Igor Sikorsky) B737-400 UR-CSV (msn 27831).
At Kyiv Boryspil, grounded aircraft belong to Ukrainian charter carrier SkyUp Airlines, Azur Air Ukraine, and 
Windrose Airlines, Flightradar24 ADS-B data shows.
Ryanair is the worst affected at Kyiv and has announced it has suspended its Ukrainian services for at least 14 
days due to the Russian invasion. "All flights to/from Ukraine have been removed from sale for at least next four 
weeks until further information becomes available from EU safety agencies. Ryanair remains committed to our 
Wizz Air to extract four aircraft grounded in Ukraine
services to/from Ukraine and we look forward to restoring flight services there as soon as it is safe to do so," it said 
in a statement.
Ryanair cancelled its flights from Madrid, Catania, and Barcelona El Prat (Spain); Bratislava (Slovakia); Paphos 
(Cyprus); Vienna (Austria); Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, Berlin, and Cologne (Germany); Naples Capodichino (Italy); 
Athens (Greece); Gdansk and Warsaw (Poland); and Manchester Int'l (UK).
Other cancellations came from Turkish Airlines from Istanbul New and Pegasus Airlines from Ankara Esenboga 
(Turkey). Turkish Airlines normally serves six destinations in Ukraine: Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, and 
Zaporizhzhia.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines cancelled flights from Amsterdam Schiphol (Netherlands). "It is not yet clear when KLM 
will fly to Kyiv again," the Dutch airline announced. "KLM has not been flying over the eastern regions of Ukraine 
and Crimea since 2014. There are now no more KLM flights through Ukrainian airspace until further notice."
Qatar Airways suspended all its flights from Yerevan (Armenia). "All Qatar Airways flights to Ukraine have been 
temporarily suspended. We continue to closely monitor developments," the Qatari flag carrier announced on social 
media.
airBaltic from Riga (Latvia) followed suit by cancelling all its flights to Ukraine from February 24 to March 13, 2022. 
"The safety of our passengers and employees is the main priority of airBaltic. airBaltic is evaluating the current 
situation before each flight and following the recommendations issued by official authorities. airBaltic is flexible and 
ready to adjust its flight schedule if necessary. We recommend everyone to organise your own transportation to

Feb 25, 2022( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ukraine has closed its airspace to civilian flights after Russia began military action in the country's east. 
It cited a high risk to flight safety due to the use of weapons and military equipment in the Donbas region. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency warned of additional safety risks in flying in bordering airspace in 
Russia and Belarus. 
"There is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft," the regulator said. 
"The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a high risk for civil 
flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels." 
Aircraft flying to or from UK airports have been ordered to avoid Ukraine's airspace by the Transport Secretary 
Grant Shapps. 
British citizens were advised to leave the country on Tuesday. 
Putin unleashes Russian forces on Ukraine[1]What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?[2] 
Shapps tweeted: "I've instructed UK—CAA (the Civil Aviation Authority) to ensure airlines avoid Ukraine airspace to 
keep passengers and crew safe. 
"We continue to stand with the people of Ukraine and work with our international partners to respond to this act of 
aggression." 
Wizz Air and Ryanair, who were still flying to the Ukraine from the UK, said they had suspended all flights. 
In 2014, a missile brought down passenger plane MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 
people on board. 
The aircraft was brought down three months after fighting broke out when pro-Russian separatists in the Donbass 
region declared independence. 
Investigators tracked the missile that was used to Russia, which denies it was involved.

Volotea (V7, Asturias) has been awarded a four-year Public Service Obligation (PSO) contract to operate the Paris 
Orly-Lourdes/Tarbes domestic route in France starting on June 1, 2022.
The airline will ply the route 2x daily on a year-round basis, using a 156-seat A319-100. The contracting 
organisation, local business and administration consortium Pyrenia, has not published the results of the tender yet 
let alone the subsidy awarded to the airline. Amelia (NL, Paris Le Bourget) and Chalair Aviation (CE, Caen) also 
submitted competing proposals.
Volotea will take over the route from HOP! (A5, Paris Orly), which currently operates it 18x weekly using an E145 
under the Air France (AF, Paris CDG) code. The current four-year PSO contract is worth up to EUR2.4 million euros 
(USD2.7 million).
Currently, the only other operator serving Lourdes/Tarbes is Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), which operates exclusively 
international routes out of the airport.
Volotea said its decision to apply for the PSO was a part of its focus on the French domestic market. Although the 
carrier is headquartered in Spain, its two main markets are Italy (61.2% of total Volotea's scheduled departure 
capacity) and France (23.1%). In terms of the French domestic market, Volotea has a 3% market share.

Norwegian to add capacity at Stockholm Arlanda and will launch three new direct routes to popular holiday

Norwegian continues to strengthen its presence in the Swedish market and is launching another three new 
European routes from Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The airline is meeting demand for trips to the sun by adding 
service to Antalya, Thessaloniki and Mykonos. With the new connections, Norwegian will offer 57 direct routes this 
summer from its reopened base at Arlanda.
Norwegian continues to invest in Sweden and at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The airline plans to re-open its base in 
April, in conjunction with the start of the 2022 summer programme. In January, Norwegian had 15 destinations on 
offer from Stockholm Arlanda, including the domestic destinations Umeå, Luleå and Kiruna, and this summer will 
offer a total of 57 routes from Arlanda, a number of which are new for Arlanda and complement the airport's range 
of destinations on offer.
In time for the midsummer holiday, Norwegian is now launching non-stop service to Greece and Turkey, popular 
tourist destinations where many also travel to visit relatives and friends.
"Naturally, it is really good news that Norwegian, which is one of our biggest customers, is investing further in 
Sweden and continues to expand its range of routes and access from Stockholm Arlanda as people's wanderlust 
grows and demand is again on the rise," says Elizabeth Axtelius, Director of Aviation Business at Swedavia.
Antalya in southwest Turkey is a popular tourist destination from Sweden and the second biggest Turkish 
destination from Arlanda. With the new route, it will be the first time Norwegian is offering scheduled service to 
Turkey. Antalya is currently served by Pegasus Airlines and Sun Express and this summer also by Turkish Airlines.
Mykonos, situated in the Greek archipelago and surrounded by the Aegean Sea, is also a popular tourist 
destination from Sweden. There has been no service to Mykonos from Arlanda since 2018, but during the summer 
the city will be served by both Norwegian and the German carrier Eurowings.
Like the other destinations, Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, is a frequent destination for tourists 
from Sweden during the summer, but there is also great demand for non-stop service from travellers flying to meet 
friends and family. Both Ryanair and SAS have served the route since last autumn.
Norwegian to add capacity at Stockholm Arlanda and will launch three new direct routes to popular holiday 
destinations
"Now when we can finally travel and meet, the number of flights on offer is growing at a brisk pace. We at 
Swedavia, together with the aviation industry, are working actively to speed up the development of net zero air 
travel," concludes Elizabeth Axtelius, Director of Aviation Business at Swedavia.
Between June 10 and August 13, 2022, Norwegian will serve the route Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN) - Mykonos 
International Airport (JMK) with two weekly departures on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Between June 13 and August 12, 2022, Norwegian will serve the route Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN) - Antalya 
Airport (AYT) with two weekly departures on Mondays and Thursdays.
Between June 16 and August 12, 2022, Norwegian will serve the route Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN) - 
Thessaloniki Airport Makedonia (SKG) with one weekly departure on Thursdays.
Norwegian strives to be a leader in the development towards a more sustainable climate and wants to be the 
preferred choice for all travellers. By 2030, Norwegian shall fly with 45% fewer emissions of carbon dioxide 
compared to 2010, and use up to 28% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030. The goal is to continue flying with 
one of the world's most modern fleet of aircraft and offer more non-stop routes, which results in fewer departures 
and landings and significant emission reductions. Norwegian will eliminate all non-recyclable plastics and is 
investing in new technology, which includes smart apps for weather data and more fuel-efficient flights that 
contribute to reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Norwegian has signed a collaboration agreement with Neste, the 
world's leading producer of SAF, and is now offering its corporate customers the possibility of reducing their 
CO2emissions from business travel by up to 80 per cent by using SAF.
Swedavia's work for net zero aviation
Swedavia has carried out ambitious sustainability work sustainability work for many years. All ten of its airports 
achieved the goal of zero fossil carbon dioxide emissions from their own operations by year-end 2020. Swedavia 
also works actively to promote the switch to sustainable aviation fuel and has the goal that five per cent of all fuel 
used for refuelling at Swedish airports shall be fossil-free by 2025. Swedavia's climate transition work and 
pioneering work to operate climate-smart airports have won international awards, and in 2021 the trade 
organisation Airports Council International (ACI) named Stockholm Arlanda Airport Eco-Innovation Airport of the 
Year. Swedavia offers all travellers flying from one of its airports the option of buying biofuel for their entire journey 
or parts of it via flygreenfund.se/swedavia.
Swedavia complies with the authorities' advice and recommendations on Covid-19. In addition, we comply with 
international aviation industry regulations. For information about the measures Swedavia has introduced for safe 
travel, see for example: swedavia.com/arlanda/before-your-journey.

launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour overnight. 
The Foreign Office has advised against all travel to Ukraine and told British nationals in the country to leave 
'immediately' if it is safe to do so. 
'There are multiple reports of widespread military activity[1] and real risk to life,' it warned. Russian President 
Vladimir Putin 'launched a barrage of missile strikes and sent troops and tanks into Ukraine', beginning what 'many 
fear will be Europe's worst conflict[2] since the Second World War', said the Financial Times[3]. Ukraine British 
citizens were first advised to leave Ukraine two weeks ago when commercial flights were still available. At the time, 
The Guardian[4] said the number was thought to be 'in the low thousands'. 'Many have strong ties there and are 
unlikely to leave,' added the newspaper. 
Britons in the vicinity of military activity have been advised by theForeign Office[5]website to 'stay indoors, away 
from windows, and remain alert to developments that would allow you to leave safely'. It addsthat commercial 
routes out of the country are likely to be 'severely disrupted' after Russia launched its major military assault. Wizz 
Air, Ryanair and Ukraine International Airlines have temporarily suspended their routes in and out of Ukraine. 
Ukraine's neighbours to the west Anyone visiting the countries on Ukraine's border, including Poland, Slovakia, 
Hungary, Romania and Moldova, has been advised by the Foreign Office to avoid crossing into Ukraine. 
According to the Berlin-based magazine bne IntelliNews[6], security is being stepped up in Moldova amid fears that 
it 'could be the next target for Russia'. For decades, the Kremlin has backed separatists in a narrow strip of land on 
the Moldovan border with Ukraine, called Transnistria. The UK Foreign Office[7] advises against all travel to this 
area, which it says is 'outside the control of the Moldovan authorities'. 
Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania are Nato[8] members, unlike Moldova, which offers them the military 
protection of the alliance. And Nato is 'ramping up its military response' after Russia's invasion 'by beefing up land, 
sea and air forces on its eastern flank and putting more than 100 warplanes on high alert', reported The 
Independent[9]. North of Ukraine To the north of Ukraine is Belarus[10], one of Russia's closest allies[11]. The 
Atlantic Council[12]'s Brian Whitmore this week argued that the country is now effectively part of 'Putin's new 
Russian empire' after it announced 'that the estimated 30,000 Russian troops currently in the country would remain 
there indefinitely'. The UK Foreign Office[13] advises against 'all travel' to eight regions of Belarus and 'all but 
essential travel' to the remainder of the country. 
Is it safe to visit Eastern Europe?
As the world watches Ukraine, the three Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - are focused on what 
Moscow's actions in Belarus means for their security, said the Financial Times[14]. 
An imminent attack on the Baltics, 'the only ex-Soviet countries to have joined the EU and Nato', seems unlikely, 
said the paper. However, they 'worry about Russia's ability to cut them off from the rest of Europe via the Suwalki 
gap, the narrow 65km Polish-Lithuanian border, seen as one of Nato's most vulnerable points'. 
Despite these concerns, the Foreign Office notes that most visits by British travellers to the Baltics - as well as to 
Poland[15], Romania[16] and Moldova - are 'trouble free'.

Wizz Air to carry on flying to Ukraine

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) is to continue flying to Ukraine despite Russian premier Vladimir Putin ordering 
Russian troops to enter the country.
A spokesperson for the London-listed budget airline quoted in the Telegraph said that it "is committed to continuing 
to fly to Ukraine and the country remains an important part of our growth plans."
Expansion in Ukraine is key to expansion plans for Wizz Air said executives and is part of the company's plan to 
triple its fleet to 500 planes by the end of the decade.
Chief executive Jozsef Varadi said last month that "Ukraine has been performing as a very strong market, and we 
have been following that through, be it additional investments into the network and deployment of aircraft in the 
marketplace."
The move sets it apart from other Western airlines such Swiss Air and Lufthansa, which announced over the 
weekend they would be suspending flights due to concerns over passenger safety.
Competitor Ryanair has also scaled back its services to the area, with chief executive Michael O'Leary saying it 
would continue to fly to the country for as long as war does not break out.
Shares in Wizz Air were down 2.37% in afternoon trading, changing hands at 3950p.

 https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/ryanair-holdings-plc-logo.jpgZacks Investment Research[1] upgraded shares of 
Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research note released on Friday, Zacks.com[2] 
reports. They currently have $114.00 target price on the transportation company's stock.  
According to Zacks, 'Continued improvement in Ryanair's traffic on a year-over-year basis is encouraging. The 
carrier's January traffic surged over 400%. Recovery in traffic is driving the airline's top line, which soared over 
100% in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. Mainly due to the recovery in traffic, shares of Ryanair have 
outperformed its industry in a year. The carrier's efforts to expand its fleet to cater to the recovering travel demand 
are impressive. Its sound liquidity position is an added positive. However, omicron-induced travel restrictions are 
hurting the airline's bookings. Softness in bookings is weighing on the company's fiscal 2022 outlook. The carrier 
anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic to be even less than 100 million passengers. Net loss in the period is expected to be 
as wide as €250-€450 million.' 
A number of other research analysts have also recently commented on the company. Morgan Stanley restated an 
overweight rating on shares of Ryanair in a research note on Tuesday, November 2nd. Liberum Capital raised 
Ryanair from a hold rating to a buy rating in a research report on Wednesday, January 19th. JPMorgan Chase & 
Co. increased their target price on Ryanair to €21.00 ($23.86) in a report on Friday, January 21st. Barclays 
reaffirmed an overweight rating on shares of Ryanair in a report on Tuesday, November 2nd. Finally, Raymond 
James dropped their price objective on Ryanair from $140.00 to $138.00 and set an outperform rating on the stock 
in a report on Monday, November 29th. Six equities research analysts have rated the stock with a hold rating and 
thirteen have given a buy rating to the company. According to data from MarketBeat.com, the company has an 
average rating of Buy and a consensus target price of $106.39. 
 NASDAQ:RYAAY[3] opened at $107.90 on Friday. Ryanair has a 12 month low of $95.06 and a 12 month high of 
$127.25. The stock has a 50 day moving average of $111.33 and a two-hundred day moving average of $110.34. 
The company has a current ratio of 1.34, a quick ratio of 1.34 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.96. The firm has a 
market cap of $24.45 billion, a P/E ratio of -30.65 and a beta of 1.58.

Highlight: A travel company's success with millennials and Gen Z can now be determined by its performance on 
social media, with positive performance encouraging brand loyalty while boosting visibility.
Body
According to GlobalData's Q1 2021 Consumer Survey, 25% of global respondents consider the ability to engage 
directly with a brand as an essential or key driver of purchase. A further 42% consider direct engagement as nice to 
have, but not essential. Direct engagement with a brand acting as a key driver rises to 42% for Gen Z and 40% for 
millennials, showcasing that a strong presence on social media is especially important when capturing the attention 
of younger age cohorts. 
Social media increases accessibility and boosts authenticityTravel companies become more accessible to existing 
and potential customers via platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. These platforms 
allow companies to convey their personalities in a way that could not be done before, which often creates 
differentiation and allows for the creation of more authentic content that can build relationships. Ryanair is a leader 
in this space. The airline currently has 1.5 million followers on TikTok, which allows the company to already be in 
the minds of its next generation of customers. It has gained a mass following on various platforms because it 
capitalises on viral content, such as memes that are entertaining and relatable. Additionally, social media allows for 
widescale company contact through direct messaging services, allowing for enhanced levels of customer service. 
Dutch airline KLM considers social media to be an integral part of its customer relationship strategy. Since 2010, 
KLM has gained a reputation as a pioneer in the field of social media by consistently adopting the most advanced 
social media-related technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and voice-activated technology to boost service 
levels. As a result, KLM now offers a 24-hour customer service platform via various social media sites in ten 
different languages. Investment of resource into social media will growWith social media's ever-growing popularity, 
travel companies have moved to where their younger customers are. As such, social media will continue to grow as 
an integral part of travel companies' strategic operations, as specific roles and teams managing social media output 
continue to be expanded at all major companies. According to GlobalData's Job Analytics Database, there was a 
175.8% increase in social media-related jobs in the travel and tourism industry from 2020 to 2021, showcasing the 
Travel companies must be active on social media to engage with younger audiences
increasing importance of this area for travel companies, as well as the investment of resource that is now going into 
it.

AIR FRANCE yesterday cancelled today's flights between Paris and Kiev "as a precautionary measure" following 
the increasing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.
"In view of the local situation and as a precautionary measure, flights AF1752 and AF1753 to and from Kiev (KBP) 
on Tuesday 22 February 2022 are cancelled," the carrier told Reuters. "Air France is constantly monitoring the 
geopolitical situation in the territories it serves."
It follows the likes of Lufthansa and Vueling, both of which halted Ukraine operations last week. Wizz Air and 
Ryanair flights continue.

Liverpool Airport's expansion master plan to be reviewed on environmental grounds

Liverpool Airport never really fulfilled its potential after being overlooked as the English northwest region's primary 
international gateway 60 years ago.
But in recent years, under (majority) private sector ownership, it has managed to secure a niche as a low cost 
airport with two of the biggest hitters in that segment, easyJet and Ryanair, taking up most of the capacity.
It is quite recent, but just pre-pandemic the airport's 'Strategic Vision' and master plan statements identified a new 
goal - that of being 'the airport of choice' for the northwest.
But that is a tall order when Britain's third busiest and six times bigger airport is less than 50km away down the 
motorway.
Nevertheless, the coronavirus pandemic has been something of a leveller, and if Liverpool is ever to do it, now is 
the time to go for it.
But apart from the additional traffic it would bring, such ambition has to be matched by infrastructure spending, and 
firstly the city council must understand fully what the impacts of that would be on its perception from an 
environmental viewpoint. That is why it is a laudable decision to review the airport's expansion master plan from the 
environmental perspective. What might not be so laudable is for the council to sell its small stake.
As John Lennon, after whom the airport is now named, once said, "A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A 
dream you dream together is reality."

The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have been met in different ways by different airlines in Europe. 
Broadly speaking, airlines with long haul and business class products have suffered more than those with a 
short/medium haul and more leisure-focused network.
This has meant that Europe's low cost airlines have not suffered quite as badly as full service legacy airlines.
However, not all LCCs are the same, with some hit harder than others by the COVID crisis. Focusing on Europe's 
four leading independent LCCs and how their fleet sizes have changed highlights differences in their fortunes, 
whether due to COVID or other factors.
Norwegian has been in contraction mode since before the pandemic, whereas easyJet's fleet has now stabilised, 
after a small reduction during the crisis.
Ryanair's growth was interrupted by Boeing's 737 MAX suspension, but the Irish ultra-LCC has now resumed 
growth, thanks to the 737 MAX's resumption. Wizz Air, almost oblivious to the pandemic, has continued its rapid 
fleet growth virtually uninterrupted.
Both for this year and into the medium term, Wizz Air and Ryanair have the clearest fleet medium term growth 
ambitions among the four airlines.

Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Friday, Zacks.com[2] 
reports. They currently have $114.00 price target on the transportation company's stock.  
According to Zacks, "Continued improvement in Ryanair's traffic on a year-over-year basis is encouraging. The 
carrier's January traffic surged over 400%. Recovery in traffic is driving the airline's top line, which soared over 
100% in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. Mainly due to the recovery in traffic, shares of Ryanair have 
outperformed its industry in a year. The carrier's efforts to expand its fleet to cater to the recovering travel demand 
are impressive. Its sound liquidity position is an added positive. However, omicron-induced travel restrictions are 
hurting the airline's bookings. Softness in bookings is weighing on the company's fiscal 2022 outlook. The carrier 
anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic to be even less than 100 million passengers. Net loss in the period is expected to be 
as wide as €250-€450 million."

LUFTHANSA announced yesterday it will be suspending all flights to the Ukraine capital Kyiv from today as fears of 
a Russian invasion grow.
The German airline said it will also stop flights to Odessa, a key port city on the Black Sea.
The response contrasts to the Irish budget airline Ryanair and the Hungarian Wizz Air, who are still running flights 
to the Ukraine.
Last week, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said it was important "not to panic" and added: "Is it our duty 
and obligation to support the people of Ukraine as long as there is no war or missiles flying there."
Yesterday, Europe minister James Cleverly said a Russian invasion of Ukraine is "very, very likely and very, very 
imminent".
Cleverly said that: "At the moment, an attack, an invasion seems far more likely than unlikely but we will continue to 
work to try and avert that."

How would a conflict in Ukraine impact European airlines?

 With tensions between Russia and Ukraine, what might be the impact if a conflict should break out in the region? 
Looking at the largest western airline groups, the percentage of operations into Ukraine is relatively low, under one 
percent for each of the major airline groups with the exception of Wizz Air, which has roughly three percent of its 
flights into Ukraine.  
The direct results of a potential conflict are already being felt, as several carriers, including KLM, Lufthansa, 
SWISS, Austrian, Vueling, and Emirates have suspended flights to and from Ukraine, with additional suspensions of 
service likely. Other than Ukrainian operators, who are based in the country, the remaining carriers have little 
exposure. 
Given that direct impacts from schedules are not particularly significant, the question then turns to other impacts. 
Ukraine is directly on the main route utilized for Europe- Asian flights and was the site of the shoot-down of 
Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in July 2014 at the start of the conflict over the Eastern regions of Ukraine. Further 
hostilities or outright war will likely cause severe disruptions with routing for aircraft away from Ukrainian and 
Russian airspace near the conflict zone, extending both the time and costs for long-haul flights. It could even result 
in total blocking, hence the suspension of civil air traffic via Russia. But given the current restrictions in Japan and 
China, frequencies on many of those routes have been temporarily reduced, although other Asian carriers use 
Russian airspace to and from Europe. Given Covid restrictions, the impact of route restrictions seems to be 
minimal. 
A conflict in the region, which could spread into Europe, could significantly destabilize the continent and have a far-
reaching impact on the world's economy. In the build-up to the conflict, global oil prices have already gone up. They 
could increase from 10-25 percent, depending on the length and severity of a conflict. Fuel costs account for nearly 
50 percent of costs for ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air, and about 35 percent for network carriers 
like IAG (British Airways, Iberia), Lufthansa Group, and Air France-KLM. While most of the airlines in Europe have 
fuel hedges[1] for on average about 50 percent of their needs, it is notable that Wizz Air has not yet hedged fuel in 
2022, and could be negatively impacted by the rise in fuel prices. 
Overall, the impact of a Ukrainian conflict should be relatively mild for European carriers and limited to the 
economic impact of higher fuel prices. Unless an extended conflict spreads to other regions and into Europe and 
the safety of air travel becomes a factor.

A week after Shell delivered 2021 results that saw its earnings climb handsomely, chief executive Ben van Beurden 
sold £3.9mn in shares. He benefited from an increase in the company's share price, which is up 15 per cent this 
year alone.
Shell declined to comment on the sale, calling it a "private matter". The company's projects and technology director 
Harry Brekelmans also sold (EURO)2.9mn (£2.5mn) in shares last week.
HSBC analysts Gordon Gray and Kim Fustier suggested Shell's share price may be nearing a high. "While the 
near-term upside in Shell's share price may be somewhat limited as a result of [oil markets stabilising] we think 
longer term upside could be more substantial as the company builds credibility as a key enabler of the energy 
transition," they said.

Airbus CEO says hydrogen plane is 'the ultimate solution'
Airbus CEO says hydrogen plane is 'the ultimate solution'

Aviation could face substantial challenges if it's unable to decarbonize in a timely manner, according to the CEO of 
Airbus, who added that hydrogen planes represent the "ultimate solution" for the mid and long term.
In an interview with CNBC's Rosanna Lockwood on Feb. 17, Guillaume Faury - who was speaking after his firm 
reported earnings earlier in the day - said aviation would "potentially face significant hurdles if we don't manage to 
decarbonize at the right pace."
The environmental footprint of aviation is significant, with the World Wildlife Fund describing it as "one of the 
fastest-growing sources of the greenhouse gas emissions driving global climate change." The WWF also says air 
travel is "currently the most carbon intensive activity an individual can make."
Faury laid out a number of areas Airbus was focusing on. These included ensuring planes burned less fuel and 
emitted less carbon dioxide. In addition, the aircraft the firm was delivering now had a certified capacity for 50% 
sustainable aviation fuel in their tanks.
"We need to see the SAF industry moving forwards, being developed, being grown to serve airlines and to be able 
to use that capacity of 50% of SAF," he said, referring to the sustainable aviation fuel industry. "We'll go to 100% by 
the end of the decade."
The above represented a "very important part of what we're doing" Faury said. "The next one is looking at the mid-
term and long-term future to bring to the market the hydrogen plane because this is really the ultimate solution," he 
said, noting that a lot of engineering, research and capital commitments would be required.
In Sept. 2020, Airbus released details of three "hybrid-hydrogen" concept planes, saying they could enter service by 
the year 2035. The same month saw a hydrogen fuel-cell plane capable of carrying passengers complete its 
maiden flight.
While there is excitement in some quarters about hydrogen planes and their ability to potentially reduce aviation's 
environmental footprint, a considerable amount of work needs to be done to commercialize the technology and roll 
it out on a large scale.
Airbus CEO says hydrogen plane is 'the ultimate solution'
Speaking to CNBC last October, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary appeared cautious when it came to the outlook for 
new and emerging technologies in the sector.
"I think ... we should be honest again," he said. "Certainly, for the next decade ... I don't think you're going to see 
any - there's no technology out there that's going to replace ... carbon, jet aviation."
"I don't see the arrival of ... hydrogen fuels, I don't see the arrival of sustainable fuels, I don't see the arrival of 
electric propulsion systems, certainly not before 2030," he added.
On the sustainable aviation fuel front, Faury's comments represent the latest addition to a discussion that has 
become increasingly important in recent years as concerns about sustainability mount.
Although the European Union Aviation Safety Agency says there's "not a single internationally agreed definition" of 
sustainable aviation fuel, the overarching idea is that it can be used to reduce an aircraft's emissions.
In terms of content, Airbus has previously described sustainable aviation fuels as being "made from renewable raw 
material." It said the most common feedstocks "are crops based or used cooking oil and animal fat."
Last week, the director-general of the International Air Transport Association told CNBC that consumers would be 
willing to pay the extra costs associated with the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel.
"Sustainable fuels are about twice what you're paying for ... the traditional jet kerosene, so it does represent a 
significant hike in the airline industry's cost base," Willie Walsh said. "And ultimately, consumers will have to pay 
that, that's far too much for the industry to bear."
Long term, they would recognize this was the case. "This is such an important issue. Ultimately, they will be willing 
to pay," he added.

Ryanair Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research  from a "sell" rating to a "hold" 
rating in a note issued to investors on Friday, Zacks.com  reports. The brokerage currently has a $114.00 price 
objective on the transportation company's stock. Zacks Investment Research 's target price indicates a potential 
upside of 5.08% from the company's current price.  
•
Airline Stocks - Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now 
According to Zacks, "Continued improvement in Ryanair s traffic on a year-over-year basis is encouraging. The 
carrier s January traffic surged over 400%. Recovery in traffic is driving the airline s top line, which soared over 
100% in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. Mainly due to the recovery in traffic, shares of Ryanair have 
outperformed its industry in a year. The carrier s efforts to expand its fleet to cater to the recovering travel demand 
are impressive. Its sound liquidity position is an added positive. However, omicron-induced travel restrictions are 
hurting the airline s bookings. Softness in bookings is weighing on the company s fiscal 2022 outlook. The carrier 
anticipates fiscal 2022 traffic to be even less than 100 million passengers. Net loss in the period is expected to be 
as wide as  250- 450 million." 
RYAAY has been the topic of a number of other research reports. Wolfe Research downgraded Ryanair from an 
"outperform" rating to a "peer perform" rating in a research note on Wednesday, January 12th. Raymond James

research note on Tuesday, November 2nd. JPMorgan Chase & Co. upped their price target on Ryanair to  21.00 
($23.86) in a research note on Friday, January 21st. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein downgraded Ryanair from an 
"outperform" rating to a "market perform" rating in a research note on Monday, November 8th. Six analysts have 
rated the stock with a hold rating and thirteen have given a buy rating to the stock. According to data from 
MarketBeat.com, the stock currently has a consensus rating of "Buy" and a consensus price target of $106.39.

day moving average is $110.35. The firm has a market capitalization of $24.59 billion, a PE ratio of -30.82 and a

European authorities that it is not safe to fly," he said during a press conference in Lisbon as he stressed it was 
"important not to panic." The carrier announced in January it would open bases in the country if Russia desisted 
from invading. Wizz will also continue normal operations.

? European shares slide, led lower by bank and travel companies ? Investors rush to the relative safety of core 
government debt ? Brent crude breaches $95 a barrel as Ukraine tension mounts Stocks sold off across most main 
bourses yesterday as on-edge investors were gripped by fears that Russia would go to war with Ukraine.
The continent-wide Stoxx Europe 600 index closed down 1.8 per cent, dragged lower by its banking sector, which 
dived 3.2 per cent.
Triggering the slide in lenders was a rally in haven assets, such as government debt, which are sought after for their 
relative safety. This led to the yield on the 10-year German Bund - the de facto European debt benchmark - sliding 
11 basis points to 0.28 per cent.
Falling yields can squeeze the profits for big lenders, hence yesterday's dip in banks, which dived alongside stocks 
linked to travel and leisure.
Hotel group Accor and airlines Lufthansa and Ryanair all fell sharply as a number of western governments warned 
that Russia could launch a full-blown invasion of Ukraine within days. Russia, however, denied such plans.
Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: "Should Russia go to war with Ukraine, there is no telling how 
long the battle will last, and the damage wrought on the stock market."
London's FTSE 100 fell 1.7 per cent, while both Frankfurt's Xetra Dax and the CAC 40 in Paris sank more than 2 
per cent during a volatile session.
The day in the markets What you need to know
"Uncertainty is terrible for investors," added Hewson, "and it will take real nerve to stay invested through war, 
particularly as news headlines are likely to cause panic on the markets."
Such unease was evident in Russia's main stock market, the Moex, which was down 1.8 per cent yesterday and is 
more than 8 per cent lower so far this year.
A European conflict could also stoke inflation, which is already soaring, said Capital Economics. "A Russian 
invasion of Ukraine or severe ratcheting up of sanctions would add as much as 2 percentage points to inflation in 
developed markets, particularly in Europe," said its economists.
In the US, markets were calmer, helped by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, suggesting that diplomatic 
talks with the west should continue.
Wall Street's S&P 500 index edged up 0.1 per cent at lunchtime in New York while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 
Composite climbed 0.8 per cent.
Nevertheless, the prospect of war sent the price of oil to its highest level since 2014. Brent crude, the global 
benchmark, rose above $95 a barrel, a seven-year high. Ray Douglas

 KEY POINTSThe couple said they tried to show their boarding passes to a cabin crew memberThe attendant 
allegedly dismissed them and asked them to take their seatsThey realized the mistake only when they reached 
anairport in the French city of Beauvais A U.K. couple claimed they landed in the wrong country afterRyanair put 
them on the wrong flight. They are now urging the airline to make an apology and reimburse their tickets as well as 
the expenses they incurred after the incident. 
Simon Forster and Emma Schofield, from Manchester, said they planned a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark,a few 
days before Christmasbut ended up landing at an airport near Paris, France, which is 750 miles away from their 
supposed destination, Manchester Evening News reported[1]. 
On the day of their journey, the couple reportedly reached their departure gate at the Manchester Airport after 
battling a "horrendous" queue at the security check caused by the Christmas rush.At the gate, a Ryanair staff 
member allegedly asked if they were bound forCopenhagen and checked their passports and boarding passes 
before ushering them downstairs. They were soon made to board the only waiting plane on the runway. 
Forster saidthey tried to show their boarding passes to a cabin crew member while boarding the aircraft. However, 
the attendant allegedlydismissed them, saying, "Oh don't worry about it," and askedthem to take their seats, 
according to the report. 
The couple realized the mistake only when they were greeted with "bonjour" at the passport control office in an 
airport in the French city of Beauvais. 
"We landed in less time than we expected and as we walked into the airport I thought I didn't recognize it and I go to 
Copenhagen quite a lot. We were greeted at passport control with 'Bonjour'and it became apparent that we were in 
France," they recalled. 
The couple had to spend the weekend in France before flyinghome on a different airline. 
"I would like to understand how on earth this happened. If you put passengers on the wrong plane to the wrong 
country, you expect an apology," Forster was cited as saying byManchester Evening News. 
Forster and Schofield are nowseeking an apology from the airline. They are also demanding reimbursement for 
their flight tickets as well as the expenses they incurred in Paris, which amounted to more than$1,260.

In response,Ryanair said in a statement that it is the passenger's responsibility to ensure that they are boarding the 
right aircraft, according to Wales Online[2]. The airline[3] also said it providesseveral "touchpoints" to inform 
passengers of the aircraft's destination, including announcements on board. 
However, Foster saidthey did not hear any such announcements in English. 
 With travel restrictions easing, Ryanair earlier this month announced plans to hire more than 2,000 pilots Photo:

Comment of the Day Video commentary for February 9th 2022 A link to today's video commentary is posted in 
the Subscriber's Area.  Some of the topics discussed include: copper firms in a dynamic manner, gold and oil 
steady, steel makers firm, coffee breaks out, soybeans firm, Dollar eases, stock markets extend rebounds and bond 
yields pause. Ryanair CEO O'Leary Sees 'Dramatic' Jump in Ticket Sales This article from Bloomberg may 
be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section:Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has seen a "dramatic 
recovery" in bookings over the past two weeks as the easing of pandemic travel curbs across Europe encourages 
people to fly again. The Irish low-cost carrier's planes are flying about 75% full and could reach 90% of capacity by 
the peak of the summer high season, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said at a briefing in Milan 
Wednesday. Ryanair expects fares to remain "very low" through May before rising for summer, by which point it's 
possible that a combination of strong demand and limited capacity could see them climb above pre-coronavirus 
levels, O'Leary said. 
Trends for next winter are difficult to predict, he said. My view - Most people are hungering for a traditional vacation. 
I know I am. As the omicron variant flares out, demand for travel and other opening-up sectors is likely to continue 
to improve. There have been several times when it looked like a full recovery was possible, only for a new variant to 
pop up and create delays. The good news is the last one was much less serious, albeit much more transmissible, 
than its forerunners. That suggests the bounce back in demand will be stronger this time.Russia, China agree 30-
year gas deal via new pipeline, to settle in euros This article from Reuters may be of interest to subscribers. 
Here is a section: Russia already sends gas to China via its Power of Siberia pipeline, which began pumping 
supplies in 2019, and by shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG). It exported 16.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to 
China in 2021. The Power of Siberia network is not connected to pipelines that send gas to Europe, which has 
faced surging gas prices due to tight supplies, one of several points of tension with Moscow. Under plans previously 
Ryanair CEO O'Leary Sees 'Dramatic' Jump in Ticket Sales
drawn up, Russia aimed to supply China with 38 bcm of gas by pipeline by 2025. The new deal, which coincided 
with a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Beijing Winter Olympics, would add a further 10 bcm, 
increasing Russian pipeline sales under long-term contracts to China. My view - Exporting gas is not Russia's 
biggest money spinner but it creates reliance that is priceless from a geopolitical perspective. More than doubling 
gas exports to China might be described as an alliance of autocrats but the reality is China needs energy. That's 
not an equal partnership even if the long-term pricing structure is competitive. Russia is building a network of 
dependency right across the Eurasian continent that will give it a lot of leeway to push for concessions in other 
areas.EU rolls out a red carpet for TSMC and other semiconductor giants This article from the South China 
Morning Post may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: The European Union announced a blueprint 
on Tuesday to make one-fifth of the world's microchips, saying it was "open for business" to semiconductor giants 
from Taiwan and other industry leaders. The European Chips Act provides at least Euro42 billion (US$48 billion) by 
2030 in public and private sector capital behind an ambitious plan to effectively double the bloc's chip production, to 
20 per cent of the global supply of semiconductors, the tiny processing units that will power the industries of the 
future. Currently, the bloc produces 10 per cent of the world's supply, few of which are considered to be cutting-
edge. My view - $20 billion from Intel, $38 billion from Taiwan Semiconductor, $40 billion from Taiwan 
Semiconductors this year represents a massive increase in potential supply of both chips and memory.Los 
Angeles Port Sees Chance to Ease Ship Backlog by Summer Peak This article from Bloomberg may be of 
interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Seroka said he agrees with the chief executive of a major container 
line, A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S's Soren Skou, who told Bloomberg TV in a separate interview earlier that ocean 
shipping should start to normalize in the second half of the year. Maersk, which handles almost one-fifth of the 
world's container traffic, said it sees a 2%-4% expansion in the market this year, with a strong first half followed by 
an uncertain outlook after that.  My view - Supply chain disruptions forced companies to front load orders in the 
hope they could get enough inventory in to avoid future bottlenecks. That put upward pressure on both shipping 
rates and prices to consumers. Eoin's personal portfolio: short reopened February 2nd 2022 One of the questions 
subscribers as most often is how to find details of my open trades. To make it easier I will simply repost the latest 
summary daily until there is a change. The Chart Seminar 2022 With global vaccination rates rising, the prospect of 
anti-COVID pills on the horizon and the promise of travel restrictions being dropped, it is time to start thinking about 
venues for The Chart Seminar in 2022. Please drop sarah@fullertreacymoney.com a line if you would be interested

Ryanair Holdings Strengthens Presence in Italy

Feb 10, 2022( GuruFocus.com: http://www.gurufocus.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The number of Covid-19 infections appears to be improving as cases of serious illness and death are falling 
drastically, making investors much more optimistic about the future. 
Travelers and vacationers are certainly optimistic because they show more confidence in traveling by plane without 
the risk of infection or because they started planning their vacation very early this year. At the same time, operators 
in the tourism and travel industry are refining their operational strategies in anticipation of the next high season to 
take full advantage of this new positive wave. 
Among the travel industry, Irish airline Ryanair Holdings PLC ( RYAAY[1], Financial[2]), a provider of low-cost flights 
in the United Kingdom and Europe, caught the attention of investors on Wednesday. Ryanair announced the 
creation of new routes from Italy's two main hubs in Milan and Rome to various destinations elsewhere in Europe 
as part of its operational program for the 2022 summer season. Specifically, with an investment of over $9 billion, 
the Irish airline company aims to make the Italian market its first market in Europe, expanding its fleet from 67 
passenger aircraft to 92 passenger aircraft. Additionally, Ryanair will offer support to 43,000 flights and ground crew 
jobs, surpassing Spain and Great Britain in the process. The fleet will have approximately 480 aircraft, enabling 
Ryanair to break through the 2,100 scheduled short-haul flights offered daily, serving 210 airports. 
As Italy is a very popular destination for tourists from all over the world, the investment could have a significant 
impact on the company's future revenue and profits, potentially boosting the share price significantly. 
After an 18% year-over-year increase, the stock closed at $122 on Wednesday, which translates to a market cap of 
$27.65 billion and falls within the 52-week range of $95.06 to $127.25. 
The portfolio is recovering well from the crisis due to the Covid-19 virus pandemic. Thanks to a strong demand, 
coupled with a solid performance of specific ancillary services (boarding priority and reserved seating), total 
revenue rose 330% year over year to nearly 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the December 2021 quarter. It was a 
significant growth despite a non-full load factor (84%) and a lower average fare of 25 euros (down 24% year over 
year). The air travel guests were 8.1 million in December 2020 quarter versus 31.1 million guests in the December 
2021 quarter. 
Traffic has thus increased, but not the operational costs, which have decreased, mainly due to lower variable costs. 
But this wasn't enough to prevent a GAAP net loss of 0.085 euros per share. 
The balance sheet is one of the strongest compared to the peer group, the company said in its earnings report for 
the fourth quarter. It had nearly 3 billion euros in cash, 90% of the Boeing fleet unencumbered and 2 billion euros in 
net debt that Ryanair wants to repay completely in two years' time. 
Ryanair Holdings Strengthens Presence in Italy
Ryanair believes its financial condition is such that it can quickly capitalize on the many growth opportunities that 
the post-Covid-19 recovery will create in Europe this year and in 2023. 
The stock does not appear cheap as it is trading above the 50-day moving average of $107.71 and above the 200-
day moving average of $110.53. 
The company's huge allocation to the Italian market could point to strong upside potential in travel between April 
and September, which could be incredibly positive for the share price. If so, this stock is worth considering. 
On Wall Street, the stock has a median recommendation rating of overweight with an average target price of 
$133.04 per share. The company doesn't pay dividends.

London, Amsterdam, New York. Just Eat Takeaway's shares, like its menus, have a cosmopolitan flavour. But the 
meal-delivery group now plans to delist its shares from Nasdaq.
The costs of trading on multiple venues can outweigh the benefits. The key motivation for local listings is to provide 
foreign companies with acquisition currency. So it was with Just Eat Takeaway. Formed by the 2020 merger 
between Dutch company
www.Takeaway.com and London-listed Just Eat, that was followed by last year's $7.3bn all-share buy of US-based 
Grubhub. The latter's shareholders received 30 per cent of total share capital held via American depositary receipts 
on Nasdaq. The ADRs' share, however, has dwindled to 3.7 per cent.
US shareholders do remain, such as Connecticut-based Cat Rock Capital Management, which has a 5 per cent 
stake. The activist investor is piling pressure on the group, whose market value has more than halved over the past 
year, to offload its US business.
But US investors have shown a preference for holding ordinary shares over ADRs. While ADRs handily help 
shareholders avoid foreign currency and other hassles, they suffer from thin trading volumes and specific service 
fees. Extra costs and compliance burden for multiple listings are bad enough. Politics plays a part too.
Beijing-Washington tensions have forced a retreat of Chinese groups from Wall Street. Brexit caused Ryanair,
Just Eat Takeaway: farewell address Twitter : @FTLex
Europe's largest budget airline, to ditch its London listing to comply with EU ownership rules. Just Eat Takeaway 
has not decided on its final address, after having second thoughts on its plan to use London as its main trading 
venue. It would risk losing investors with UKonly mandates by dropping the listing.
But UK investment managers now put only 14 per cent of their funds they manage in UK equities; it was 39 per cent 
in 2020, the Investment Association says.
The erosion of home bias is limiting the benefits of secondary listings.

Boeing jet deliveries gain slight edge vs Airbus in January

CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing scored a slight edge over Airbus in deliveries of commercial jets and a bigger advantage 
in new orders in January, thanks to a dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways.
Boeing said Tuesday that it delivered 32 commercial jetliners in January, a slight improvement over a year earlier 
despite the ongoing halt in shipments of is 787 Dreamliner jet because of manufacturing problems.
Most of the deliveries were 737 Max jets including seven sent to Ryanair. A year earlier it shipped 26 planes.
Europe's Airbus delivered 30 planes in January.
Deliveries are an important source of cash for aircraft manufacturers, and Chicago-based Boeing has been unable 
to ship any 787s since last May because of flaws including gaps between fuselage panels.
Boeing also said that it took 75 net new orders last month, its 12th straight month in which orders outnumbered 
cancellations. Orders have perked up as airlines gain confidence in recovering from the pandemic.
The company said 55 of the orders were for Max jets, including 23 by American and 12 by Southwest — both 
previously announced by the carriers.
Airbus lost orders for 16 more planes than it gained during January after canceling a Qatar Airways order for 50 
A321neo jets. Airbus disclosed Tuesday that the Middle Eastern carrier's order for two A350 jets has been 
scrapped.
The cancellations stem from a dispute over the quality of paint and surfaces on some Airbus jets. Qatar is suing 
Airbus in a London court.
Last week, Qatar responded to the order cancellation by announcing that it plans instead to order Boeing 737 Max 
jets.
Boeing Co. is coming off a $4.3 billion loss in 2021, most of it in the fourth quarter, when it took a $3.5 billion charge 
related to the 787.

YEAR BEGINS WITH CHARTER TRAFFIC RECORD
The Upper Silesian Aviation Group (GTL SA) - the company managing Katowice Wojciech Korfanty International 
Airport in Pyrzowice - summarized passenger traffic results for January 2022.
In the first month of 2022, 140 776 passengers - 115 698 more (+461.3%) than in January 2021 - travelled via the 
Katowice Airport regular and charter network. The result is 48% of total passenger traffic in record-breaking January 
2020, when 290 thousand passengers were handled on flights to/from Katowice Airport.
In January 2022, 89 656 travellers - 76 749 more (+594.6%) than last year - flew on regular flights handled by Wizz 
Air, Ryanair, LOT Polish Airlines and Lufthansa. Last month, the following regular routes were the most popular: 
Dortmund (13.8 thousand passengers), London-Luton (8.0 thousand), Eindhoven (5.8 thousand), Cologne-Bonn 
(4.6 thousand), Warsaw (3.9 thousand).
A record-breaking result has been achieved in charter traffic. With 50 330 handled passengers, January 2022 has 
proved to be the best first month in this segment of traffic in the airport's history. The result from January 2019 was 
beaten; back then, 48 393 travellers were handled on charter flights. In comparison with the first month of 2021, 
there were 38 800 passengers more on charter flights in January 2022 (+336.5%). In January 2022, passengers 
most often travelled to: Marsa Alam (10.4 thousand passengers), Hurghada (10.2 thousand), Antalya (4.1 
thousand), Punta Cana (3.6 thousand), Varadero (2.4 thousand). In January 2022, 1 995 aircraft take-offs and 
landings took place in Katowice Airport, i.e. 1 081 more (+118.3%) than in January 2021.
"In spite of our concerns regarding the fifth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, passenger traffic did not collapse in 
January; it is a good sign for the upcoming months and for the acceleration of the process of traffic recovery. In 
2022, we aim to handle between 3.8 and 4 million passengers. The strength of Katowice Airport lies in charter 
traffic; in this segment of traffic, we keep seeing better load factors in comparison with regular flights. In January 
2022, an average of 102 passengers travelled on regular flights to/from Katowice Airport, and 150 on charter 
flights," said Artur Tomasik, President of the Board of GTL SA.
Katowice Airport is among the biggest regional airports in Poland. In 2019, record-breaking 4.84 million passengers 
travelled via its network; 2 million passengers flew on charter flights. The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in the 
biggest crisis in the history of the aviation industry; it slowed down the forecast growth of passenger traffic. In 2020, 
Passenger Traffic at Katowice Airport in January 2022
1.44 million passengers travelled to/from the airport, and 2.32 million in 2021. Katowice Wojciech Korfanty Airport is 
the country leader in the area of charter traffic, and the regional leader in the area of cargo traffic.

Boeing said on Feb. 8 it delivered 32 aircraft in January, the lowest in three months, as its sidelined 787 Dreamliner 
program continued to weigh on the planemaker's ability to capitalize on a recovery in air travel.
The company handed over 27 737 MAX jets in January and three widebody aircraft, including a 777 freighter, 
Boeing said in its closely watched monthly report.
Of the 27 MAX deliveries, seven were to Irish budget carrier Ryanair, while China Eastern Airlines took delivery of 
one 777 freighter.
Boeing handed over commercial 38 jets in December and 34 in November.
The 737 MAX and the 787 Dreamliner are crucial to Boeing's ability to recover from the pandemic and catch up with 
Airbus, having lost out on the delivery race to its European rival for the third consecutive year.
After slashing production mainly due to the pandemic, planemakers are seeing more demand for medium-haul 
passenger jets and freighters, and are rushing to ramp up production.
However, snags in Dreamliner production have proved costly for Boeing, with the company incurring $4.5 billion in 
charges in the fourth quarter and paying penalties to customers for pushing back deliveries.
Boeing booked 77 orders on a gross basis in January, including orders for 55 MAX airplanes and 22 freighters. 
Demand for the cargo planes has been a bright spot for the company, as it continues to dominate sales amid an e-
commerce surge.
Of the freighter orders, 14 were from Qatar Airways for the 777-8 model. The airline last month handed Boeing an 
order for 34 new 777X freighters and 25 737-10 MAX jets.
Of the 737 MAX orders in January, 20 were from unspecified customers, with U.S. carriers American Airlines Group 
Inc and Southwest Airlines Co making up the remaining 35.
There were two cancellations for the 737 MAX in January, bringing Boeing's overall net orders to 75.

Will EU inflict sanctions 'pain' on Putin?; FT BIG READ. EUROPE Brussels

A fter Belarus sent a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair flight carrying a young dissident, who was later arrested and 
detained, the EU hit back with sanctions designed to inflict a "substantial cost" on anyone who supported Alexander 
Lukashenko's dictatorial regime.
But there was a catch. It turned out that the sanctions imposed in 2021 on the lucrative petrochemicals and potash 
industries in Belarus applied only to new contracts, meaning that their impact would be gradual. And the penalties 
placed on potash came with specifications that excluded about 80 per cent of the commodity exported by the 
eastern European nation.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarusian opposition leader, warns of "regrettable" omissions in the package, which 
also included measures against the finance sector, and is demanding that new targets be added. "We should not 
underestimate the regime's ability to minimise the full impact of the EU's sanctions," she says.
Her complaints carry extra resonance as Europe, with the US, looks to create one of the hardest-hitting sanctions 
packages the west has ever deployed, this time against Russia.

The western allies are seeking tougher penalties than those imposed after Moscow's invasion of Crimea in 2014, 
hoping the threat of draconian measures will deter President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine after massing 
100,000 troops at its border.
But Moscow knows the EU faces formidable hurdles when it comes to applying sanctions. For a start, it needs 
unanimity among the 27 member states - many of which have deep economic ties to Russia. Its capitals are also 
accused by diplomats and lawyers of having a patchy record when it comes to enforcing sanctions programmes.
EU officials say they are optimistic that European capitals are ready to swallow the economic pain that would come 
with sanctions on the Russian financial sector as well as parts of its energy and high-tech industries. "We all hope 
diplomacy will succeed," Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, told the Financial Times amid 
a flurry of diplomatic initiatives. "But we also know that when it's time to use this robust package we are ready."
The ultimate test will only come when leaders convene for an emergency EU summit should Russia attack Ukraine.
"It is vital that the west maintains its unity in the face of this threat from Russia - and that means we have to have 
the EU fully on board," says Edward Fishman, a US state department official during the Obama administration.
Critics say the Belarus sanctions embody many of the frailties and limitations of the EU's framework. The measures 
against the Lukashenko regime fell short of some officials' ambitions because of carve-outs requested by EU 
countries seeking protection for companies trading with Belarus, and because of the time taken to implement and 
then enforce the measures.
The sanctions on Belarus's petrochemicals, potash and financial sectors - the first with any teeth - were agreed 
almost a year after Lukashenko began his brutal crackdown on his country's opposition in August 2020. Analysts 
say the early impact on Belarus's potash export volumes was limited, while prices soared - giving the country's 
state-controlled potash groups an unexpected shot in the arm.
"Sanctions are only a tool towards something, and the moment has passed [in Belarus]," says Maria Shagina, 
visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. "The [window] when you can apply pressure and 
translate it into something is quite narrow." The 'lowest common denominator' The EU has streamlined its sanctions 
machine in recent years. But all 27 member states must still unanimously agree on measures before they can be 
imposed. It is a very different system from the US where, in the words of Brian O'Toole of the Atlantic Council, 
action is taken by "three agencies that work for one president".
The drawn-out bureaucratic process gives greater scope for member states to demand carve-outs to protect their 
own industries, complained one official involved in the Belarus process.
"It is not easy for the commission when they have member states looking over their shoulder as they draw up 
sanctions, saying: 'No, you're overstepping your competences here', or 'we need a loophole there'," says an EU 
official. "It weakens the result. The outcome is not the highest common denominator but the lowest in terms of what 
member states can stomach."
The commission defends the multiple rounds of Belarus sanctions, insisting they are designed to be "progressive", 
meaning they can be scaled up or down depending on Minsk's behaviour.
The effectiveness of the 2014 sanctions on Russia is equally questioned. The US and EU were wrongfooted by 
Putin's actions, leading to a reactive response and fractious internal discussions as they ratcheted up their 
measures. The toughest steps were only enacted after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 over Ukraine 
by a Russian missile in July 2014.
The penalties included restrictions on companies and individuals with close ties to the Russian government, as well 
as measures related to the defence, energy and finance sectors. They failed to force Russia out of Crimea or to

energy sectors to hurt Russia should it invade Ukraine ,....
stifle Putin's military ambitions in his neighbour - although some western diplomats argue the measures dissuaded 
him from further escalation in Ukraine's Donbas region, which was seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014.
Differences between the US and EU sanctions regimes undermined their effectiveness. French energy company 
Total, for example, was able to continue partial ownership and funding of the construction of two big gas projects in 
Russia's arctic owned by Novatek, even as US banks pulled their support.
Overall the sanctions meant Russia's annual growth from 2014 to 2018 fell short of prior expectations by 0.2 per 
cent, according to an IMF report in 2019, meaning they had a much smaller impact than, for instance, the decline in 
the oil price during the same period.
Diplomats warn that Europe's regime suffers further from uneven enforcement. The US relies on a single powerful 
body - the Office of Foreign Assets Control - which has wide latitude to enforce sanctions and track their effect.
In Europe, enforcement is handled at a national level and officials say its effectiveness varies dramatically between 
member states. Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank argues that once sanctions are 
agreed at the EU level, there is sometimes the impression that "everyone has flopped over the finishing line and 
said 'thank God, we can go off and think about something else'."
Restoring brittle EU-US relations The commission tacitly accepted the need for improvement 12 months ago, when 
it proposed a more "robust and rapid implementation and enforcement" of the union's sanctions.
Yet radical change, such as the creation of an EU agency to take sanctions enforcement powers from national 
governments, remains unlikely. "Which country is going to give up more sovereignty in terms of things that can hurt 
their economy, and tell their voters that Europe now makes these decisions?" asks a senior EU official.
The crucial difference between the current planning and 2014, EU officials say, is that the detailed work between 
allies is being done early, to try to deter Putin from taking hostile action.
Intensive talks between the US and EU over Russian sanctions have now been under way for three months. They 
follow a period of brittle relations in the wake of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which European 
officials criticised as ill-co-ordinated, and the White House's nuclear submarine deal with the UK and Australia, 
which triggered a diplomatic spat with France.
Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic stress the plan is not to alight on exactly the same sanctions against 
Russia but to forge a co-ordinated approach. Officials say the unusual volume of intelligence and public briefings by 
the US on the Russian build-up helped heap pressure on reluctant EU states to back sanctions. Adding to that is an 
awareness that China is closely watching the planning, they say, as it gauges western powers' ability to rally in the 
face of a shared security threat.
Victoria Nuland, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, told the FT last month that it will be crucial to 
find ways to fairly share the economic burden of the sanctions between European countries.
"Our goal needs to be to hurt Russia more than we hurt ourselves if we have to go in this direction," she said, 
stressing that the EU and US packages didn't have to be "identical" but did have to be "equally painful".
The package taking shape will cover energy, banking, high-tech companies and oligarchs with close links to Putin. 
And western capitals are more willing to inflict pain on the Russian banking system than in 2014, when measures 
against the big state-owned banks were limited.
Sanctions on Russia's biggest financial institutions, including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank and The Russian 
Direct Investment Fund are all under consideration, say diplomats.
Will EU inflict sanctions 'pain' on Putin? FT BIG READ. EUROPE Brussels wants to target the banking and 
energy sectors to hurt Russia should it invade Ukraine ,....
In addition, the allies are willing to hit gas producers, as well as oil companies - despite anxiety over Europe's 
reliance on Russian gas. That means the Nord Stream 2 pipeline through the Baltic Sea "cannot be removed from 
the table" as far as sanctions are concerned, von der Leyen has previously said.
US and EU officials are also seeking to finalise measures preventing exports to Russia of a range of key 
technologies produced by western companies, mirroring steps taken by Washington to prevent Chinese telecoms 
company Huawei from using US-made components.
One EU diplomat says disagreements remain over the detailed scope of all the products and companies to be 
targeted. But the EU's participation in this part of the package is seen as critical given the scale of its exports to 
Russia, which totalled nearly (EURO)80bn in 2020.
The aim is to hold back high-tech components that Russia cannot easily replace by turning to alternative suppliers, 
in areas ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum computing and lasers, degrading Russia's ability to diversify 
its fossil fuel-reliant economy.
The proposals "look to be a dramatic broadening and strengthening of the [2014] measures", says Erica Moret, a 
sanctions specialist at the Graduate Institute, Geneva.
In Washington, Europe's emerging willingness to hit Putin hard is seen as the result of destabilising actions - from 
cyber attacks to the Skripal poisoning in the UK - they blame on Moscow. US officials say they believe an invasion 
of Ukraine would be a bridge too far for Europeans to tolerate in terms of the continent's security.
The Europeans are weighing the cost of imposing sanctions "against the counterfactual of an invasion in the heart 
of Europe, and ... the impact it would have to their business environment and their economic conditions", says an 
official in US president Joe Biden's administration.
The Russian threat Von der Leyen says she sees a "sense of unity" among member states. "Many were caught by 
surprise in 2014," says the commission president, "but this time we have a clear understanding of the magnitude of 
what Russia could do."
Björn Seibert, her head of cabinet, has been holding what diplomats describe as "confessional" meetings with EU 
ambassadors to understand their pain thresholds with regard to the options on the table. The aim is to have a 
detailed set of sanctions ready to be signed off in an emergency summit of EU leaders if action is needed, all in 
close co-ordination with the US, UK and other allies.
The risk remains, however, that unity between the 27 member states falters in the face of hostile or covert acts by 
Putin that fall short of an outright invasion but still have the effect of destabilising Ukraine. A number of member 
states - among them Italy and Austria - have deep business links with Moscow, while Germany draws more than 
half of its gas imports from Russia. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, last week criticised the mooted 
measures on a trip to Moscow, saying they were "doomed to failure" - although officials remain hopeful that he will 
fall into line.
Some experts argue that the power and extraterritorial reach of US sanctions mean weaknesses in the EU 
response should not prove fatal when it comes to applying pressure on Putin.
If Russian banks are subjected to tough new sanctions by the US, for example, western financial institutions will 
avoid them for fear of falling foul of the US authorities. But O'Toole of the Atlantic Council insists that having the EU 
on board will be critical to depriving
Putin of any room for manoeuvre.
"Sanctions only work as long as everybody plays ball," says a senior EU official, "that is the bottom line."

A fter Belarus sent a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair flight carrying a young dissident, who was later arrested and 
detained, the EU hit back with sanctions designed to inflict a "substantial cost" on anyone who supported Alexander 
Lukashenko's dictatorial regime.
But there was a catch. It turned out that the sanctions imposed in 2021 on the lucrative petrochemicals and potash 
industries in Belarus applied only to new contracts, meaning that their impact would be gradual. And the penalties 
placed on potash came with specifications that excluded about 80 per cent of the commodity exported by the 
eastern European nation.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarusian opposition leader, warns of "regrettable" omissions in the package, which 
also included measures against the finance sector, and is demanding that new targets be added. "We should not 
underestimate the regime's ability to minimise the full impact of the EU's sanctions," she says.
Her complaints carry extra resonance as Europe, with the US, looks to create one of the hardest-hitting sanctions 
packages the west has ever deployed, this time against Russia.

cent, according to an IMF report in 2019, meaning they had a much smaller impact than, for instance, the decline in 
the oil price during the same period.
Diplomats warn that Europe's regime suffers further from uneven enforcement. The US relies on a single powerful 
body - the Office of Foreign Assets Control - which has wide latitude to enforce sanctions and track their effect.
In Europe, enforcement is handled at a national level and officials say its effectiveness varies dramatically between 
member states. Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank argues that once sanctions are 
agreed at the EU level, there is sometimes the impression that "everyone has flopped over the finishing line and 
said 'thank God, we can go off and think about something else'."
Restoring brittle EU-US relations The commission tacitly accepted the need for improvement 12 months ago, when 
it proposed a more "robust and rapid implementation and enforcement" of the union's sanctions.
Yet radical change, such as the creation of an EU agency to take sanctions enforcement powers from national 
governments, remains unlikely. "Which country is going to give up more sovereignty in terms of things that can hurt 
their economy, and tell their voters that Europe now makes these decisions?" asks a senior EU official.
The crucial difference between the current planning and 2014, EU officials say, is that the detailed work between 
allies is being done early, to try to deter Putin from taking hostile action.
Intensive talks between the US and EU over Russian sanctions have now been under way for three months. They 
follow a period of brittle relations in the wake of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which European 
officials criticised as ill-co-ordinated, and the White House's nuclear submarine deal with the UK and Australia, 
which triggered a diplomatic spat with France.
Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic stress the plan is not to alight on exactly the same sanctions against 
Russia but to forge a co-ordinated approach. Officials say the unusual volume of intelligence and public briefings by 
the US on the Russian build-up helped heap pressure on reluctant EU states to back sanctions. Adding to that is an 
awareness that China is closely watching the planning, they say, as it gauges western powers' ability to rally in the 
face of a shared security threat.
Victoria Nuland, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, told the FT last month that it will be crucial to 
find ways to fairly share the economic burden of the sanctions between European countries.
"Our goal needs to be to hurt Russia more than we hurt ourselves if we have to go in this direction," she said, 
stressing that the EU and US packages didn't have to be "identical" but did have to be "equally painful".
The package taking shape will cover energy, banking, high-tech companies and oligarchs with close links to Putin. 
And western capitals are more willing to inflict pain on the Russian banking system than in 2014, when measures 
against the big state-owned banks were limited.
Sanctions on Russia's biggest financial institutions, including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank and The Russian 
Direct Investment Fund are all under consideration, say diplomats.

energy sectors to hurt Russia should it invade Ukraine ,....
In addition, the allies are willing to hit gas producers, as well as oil companies - despite anxiety over Europe's 
reliance on Russian gas. That means the Nord Stream 2 pipeline through the Baltic Sea "cannot be removed from 
the table" as far as sanctions are concerned, von der Leyen has previously said.
US and EU officials are also seeking to finalise measures preventing exports to Russia of a range of key 
technologies produced by western companies, mirroring steps taken by Washington to prevent Chinese telecoms 
company Huawei from using US-made components.
One EU diplomat says disagreements remain over the detailed scope of all the products and companies to be 
targeted. But the EU's participation in this part of the package is seen as critical given the scale of its exports to 
Russia, which totalled nearly (EURO)80bn in 2020.
The aim is to hold back high-tech components that Russia cannot easily replace by turning to alternative suppliers, 
in areas ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum computing and lasers, degrading Russia's ability to diversify 
its fossil fuel-reliant economy.
The proposals "look to be a dramatic broadening and strengthening of the [2014] measures", says Erica Moret, a 
sanctions specialist at the Graduate Institute, Geneva.
In Washington, Europe's emerging willingness to hit Putin hard is seen as the result of destabilising actions - from 
cyber attacks to the Skripal poisoning in the UK - they blame on Moscow. US officials say they believe an invasion 
of Ukraine would be a bridge too far for Europeans to tolerate in terms of the continent's security.
The Europeans are weighing the cost of imposing sanctions "against the counterfactual of an invasion in the heart 
of Europe, and ... the impact it would have to their business environment and their economic conditions", says an 
official in US president Joe Biden's administration.
The Russian threat Von der Leyen says she sees a "sense of unity" among member states. "Many were caught by 
surprise in 2014," says the commission president, "but this time we have a clear understanding of the magnitude of 
what Russia could do."
Björn Seibert, her head of cabinet, has been holding what diplomats describe as "confessional" meetings with EU 
ambassadors to understand their pain thresholds with regard to the options on the table. The aim is to have a 
detailed set of sanctions ready to be signed off in an emergency summit of EU leaders if action is needed, all in 
close co-ordination with the US, UK and other allies.
The risk remains, however, that unity between the 27 member states falters in the face of hostile or covert acts by 
Putin that fall short of an outright invasion but still have the effect of destabilising Ukraine. A number of member 
states - among them Italy and Austria - have deep business links with Moscow, while Germany draws more than 
half of its gas imports from Russia. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, last week criticised the mooted 
measures on a trip to Moscow, saying they were "doomed to failure" - although officials remain hopeful that he will 
fall into line.
Some experts argue that the power and extraterritorial reach of US sanctions mean weaknesses in the EU 
response should not prove fatal when it comes to applying pressure on Putin.
If Russian banks are subjected to tough new sanctions by the US, for example, western financial institutions will 
avoid them for fear of falling foul of the US authorities. But O'Toole of the Atlantic Council insists that having the EU 
on board will be critical to depriving
Putin of any room for manoeuvre.
"Sanctions only work as long as everybody plays ball," says a senior EU official, "that is the bottom line."

A fter Belarus sent a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair flight carrying a young dissident, who was later arrested and 
detained, the EU hit back with sanctions designed to inflict a "substantial cost" on anyone who supported Alexander 
Lukashenko's dictatorial regime.
But there was a catch. It turned out that the sanctions imposed in 2021 on the lucrative petrochemicals and potash 
industries in Belarus applied only to new contracts, meaning that their impact would be gradual. And the penalties 
placed on potash came with specifications that excluded about 80 per cent of the commodity exported by the 
eastern European nation.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarusian opposition leader, warns of "regrettable" omissions in the package, which 
also included measures against the finance sector, and is demanding that new targets be added. "We should not 
underestimate the regime's ability to minimise the full impact of the EU's sanctions," she says.
Her complaints carry extra resonance as Europe, with the US, looks to create one of the hardest-hitting sanctions 
packages the west has ever deployed, this time against Russia.
Will EU inflict sanctions 'pain' on Putin? FT BIG READ. EUROPE Brussels wants to target the banking and 
energy sectors to hurt Russia should it invade Ukraine ,....
The western allies are seeking tougher penalties than those imposed after Moscow's invasion of Crimea in 2014, 
hoping the threat of draconian measures will deter President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine after massing 
100,000 troops at its border.
But Moscow knows the EU faces formidable hurdles when it comes to applying sanctions. For a start, it needs 
unanimity among the 27 member states - many of which have deep economic ties to Russia. Its capitals are also 
accused by diplomats and lawyers of having a patchy record when it comes to enforcing sanctions programmes.
EU officials say they are optimistic that European capitals are ready to swallow the economic pain that would come 
with sanctions on the Russian financial sector as well as parts of its energy and high-tech industries. "We all hope 
diplomacy will succeed," Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, told the Financial Times amid 
a flurry of diplomatic initiatives. "But we also know that when it's time to use this robust package we are ready."
The ultimate test will only come when leaders convene for an emergency EU summit should Russia attack Ukraine.
"It is vital that the west maintains its unity in the face of this threat from Russia - and that means we have to have 
the EU fully on board," says Edward Fishman, a US state department official during the Obama administration.
Critics say the Belarus sanctions embody many of the frailties and limitations of the EU's framework. The measures 
against the Lukashenko regime fell short of some officials' ambitions because of carve-outs requested by EU 
countries seeking protection for companies trading with Belarus, and because of the time taken to implement and 
then enforce the measures.
The sanctions on Belarus's petrochemicals, potash and financial sectors - the first with any teeth - were agreed 
almost a year after Lukashenko began his brutal crackdown on his country's opposition in August 2020. Analysts 
say the early impact on Belarus's potash export volumes was limited, while prices soared - giving the country's 
state-controlled potash groups an unexpected shot in the arm.
"Sanctions are only a tool towards something, and the moment has passed [in Belarus]," says Maria Shagina, 
visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. "The [window] when you can apply pressure and 
translate it into something is quite narrow." The 'lowest common denominator' The EU has streamlined its sanctions 
machine in recent years. But all 27 member states must still unanimously agree on measures before they can be 
imposed. It is a very different system from the US where, in the words of Brian O'Toole of the Atlantic Council, 
action is taken by "three agencies that work for one president".
The drawn-out bureaucratic process gives greater scope for member states to demand carve-outs to protect their 
own industries, complained one official involved in the Belarus process.
"It is not easy for the commission when they have member states looking over their shoulder as they draw up 
sanctions, saying: 'No, you're overstepping your competences here', or 'we need a loophole there'," says an EU 
official. "It weakens the result. The outcome is not the highest common denominator but the lowest in terms of what 
member states can stomach."
The commission defends the multiple rounds of Belarus sanctions, insisting they are designed to be "progressive", 
meaning they can be scaled up or down depending on Minsk's behaviour.
The effectiveness of the 2014 sanctions on Russia is equally questioned. The US and EU were wrongfooted by 
Putin's actions, leading to a reactive response and fractious internal discussions as they ratcheted up their 
measures. The toughest steps were only enacted after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 over Ukraine 
by a Russian missile in July 2014.
The penalties included restrictions on companies and individuals with close ties to the Russian government, as well 
as measures related to the defence, energy and finance sectors. They failed to force Russia out of Crimea or to 
Will EU inflict sanctions 'pain' on Putin? FT BIG READ. EUROPE Brussels wants to target the banking and 
energy sectors to hurt Russia should it invade Ukraine ,....
stifle Putin's military ambitions in his neighbour - although some western diplomats argue the measures dissuaded 
him from further escalation in Ukraine's Donbas region, which was seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014.
Differences between the US and EU sanctions regimes undermined their effectiveness. French energy company 
Total, for example, was able to continue partial ownership and funding of the construction of two big gas projects in 
Russia's arctic owned by Novatek, even as US banks pulled their support.
Overall the sanctions meant Russia's annual growth from 2014 to 2018 fell short of prior expectations by 0.2 per 
cent, according to an IMF report in 2019, meaning they had a much smaller impact than, for instance, the decline in 
the oil price during the same period.

CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing said Tuesday that it delivered 32 commercial jetliners in January, a slight improvement 
over a year earlier despite the ongoing halt in shipments of is 787 Dreamliner jet because of manufacturing 
problems. 
Most of the deliveries were 737 Max jets including seven sent to Ryanair. A year earlier it shipped 26 planes. 
Deliveries are an important source of cash for aircraft manufacturers, and Boeing has been unable to ship any 787s 
since last May because of flaws including gaps between fuselage panels. 
Boeing also said that it took 75 net new orders last month, its 12th straight month in which orders outnumbered 
cancellations. Orders have perked up as airlines gain confidence in recovering from the pandemic. 
The company said 55 of the orders were for Max jets, including 23 by American and 12 by Southwest — both 
previously announced by the carriers. 
Chicago-based Boeing Co. is coming off a $4.3 billion loss in 2021, most of it in the fourth quarter, when it took a 
$3.5 billion charge related to the 787. Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?[1] Before you consider

CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing scored a slight edge over Airbus in deliveries of commercial jets and a bigger advantage 
in new orders in January, thanks to a dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways. 
Boeing said Tuesday that it delivered 32 commercial jetliners in January, a slight improvement over a year earlier 
despite the ongoing halt in shipments of is 787 Dreamliner jet because of manufacturing problems. 
Most of the deliveries were 737 Max jets including seven sent to Ryanair. A year earlier it shipped 26 planes. 
Europe's Airbus delivered 30 planes in January. 
Deliveries are an important source of cash for aircraft manufacturers, and Chicago-based Boeing has been unable 
to ship any 787s since last May because of flaws including gaps between fuselage panels. 
Boeing also said that it took 75 net new orders last month, its 12th straight month in which orders outnumbered 
cancellations. Orders have perked up as airlines gain confidence in recovering from the pandemic. 
The company said 55 of the orders were for Max jets, including 23 by American and 12 by Southwest — both 
previously announced by the carriers. 
Airbus lost orders for 16 more planes than it gained during January after canceling a Qatar Airways order for 50 
A321neo jets. Airbus disclosed Tuesday that the Middle Eastern carrier's order for two A350 jets has been 
scrapped. 
The cancellations stem from a dispute over the quality of paint and surfaces on some Airbus jets. Qatar is suing 
Airbus in a London court. 
Last week, Qatar responded to the order cancellation by announcing that it plans instead to order Boeing 737 Max 
jets. 
Boeing Co. is coming off a $4.3 billion loss in 2021, most of it in the fourth quarter, when it took a $3.5 billion charge

Spirit and Frontier: Together At Last

Feb 08, 2022( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 The news broke early yesterday, and people couldn't stop talking about it Maury Gallagher is retiring as CEO of 
Allegiant[1]! Oh wait, not that bit of news, though a hearty congratulations to Maury. Of course, the biggest news of 
the day was that Frontier and Spirit will merge[2]. Finally. This has been rumored and suggested for so long that it's 
almost anti-climactic. 
Spirit and Frontier will come together to form the 5th largest airline in the US and become a clear leader among 
ultra low cost carriers (ULCC). This may sound like an enormous airline, but put it in context. According to Cirium 
data[3], in March 2022, Ryanair will still be almost twice as large in terms of seats. 
Original photos via Spirit and Frontier 
The two airlines' paths have crossed time and time again over the years. Spirit was the original ULCC in the US, but 
Frontier got there eventually. And when Indigo Partners saw what Frontier was doing and how cheap it could buy 
the airline from wayward owner Republic, Indigo dumped its holdings in Spirit and bought up Frontier instead. 
Frontier's CEO, Barry Biffle, learned his ULCC chops at Spirit. 
Now, the two airlines will come together in a surprising way. Frontier shareholders will own 51.5 percent of the new 
company while Spirit shareholders will own only 48.5 percent. This control doesn't come cheap as Frontier will pay 
Spirit shareholders 1.9126 shares in the new company plus $2.13 for each Spirit share they own today. Spirit, after 
all, is the larger airline. Its full year 2021 revenues were $3.175 billion while Frontier's were $2.060 billion. Spirit 
ended 2021 with 173 airplanes while Frontier had only 110. But why does Frontier care about having control? This 
is the Bill Franke show. 
Bill Franke runs the Indigo Partners private equity group which has been behind all sorts of ULCCs around the 
world, most of them successes like Wizz Air and Volaris but some not so much. (Look up Avianova in Russia[4].) 
Indigo has been wildly successful in the US, both when it bought and eventually sold its stake in Spirit and with its 
cheap acquisition and subsequent IPO at Frontier. The assumption was that Indigo would eventually bring these 
two airlines together, and that is what's happening here. 
The new airline will have Bill Franke as the Chairman of the Board, and he will lead the search for the management 
team, but that's about all we know. The surviving name hasn't been chosen, nor has the headquarters city or 
anyone on the management team. There is very likely a good reason for this. 
Money. 
Spirit and Frontier: Together At Last
There is plenty in the investor presentation[5] about how this will be good for consumers and will create 
opportunities and all that, but let's remember that when Frontier went public, it took the ULCC ticker symbol. Low 
costs are the key to everything for this airline, because that's what enables low fares. There will clearly be an effort 
to get costs even lower than they already are through — and I hate the word — synergies. 
Spirit's unit cost stage-length adjusted ex-fuel and special items for 2021 was .41 cents higher than Frontier's, and 
both are very low in comparison to others. These are higher than they should be, and they will come down once 
pandemic-related issues are further behind the airline, but the fact that Frontier is lower than Spirit shows just how 
serious that airline is about costs. 
I have little doubt that Indigo will use every opportunity it can to bring down those costs. A headquarters competition 
between South Florida and Denver? Oh yeah, that's a great way to squeeze out every penny from the locals. The 
name can be used as a bargaining chip if any one area cares about it, kind of like how Dallas/Fort Worth would 
have freaked out if US Airways survived. Presumably all else being equal, Indigo would go with Spirit as the name 
since that means there are fewer airplanes to paint. But I imagine everything is on the table if there is money to be 
made. 
As for the management team, well, I'll be curious to see where that goes. I have little doubt that some of the current 
people running the airlines will just want to leave. They've been through a lot, and a merger is not easy. But 
otherwise, Bill will pick and choose those who he thinks can best create the ultimate ULCC. What exactly that 
means isn't yet clear since both airlines have come to different conclusions in some areas despite having the same 
goals. 
Yes, both airlines have a similar basic model. They use Airbus narrowbodies to serve mostly big cities to appeal to 
the leisure traveler. They both have an unbundled model that has a low base fare along with the option to either buy 
a la carte or add bundles to get to the product each traveler wants. Spirit is based in Florida while Frontier is based 
in Denver, and the networks are largely complementary with the main overlap being in Florida itself, a good place to 
be in these days of heavy leisure demand. 
In fact, looking at March, Spirit has nearly 62 percent of its departures touching Florida on one end while Frontier 
has more than 52 percent. If we look at the route map, these are the airports that have more than 3 percent of 
departures for each airline. 
Frontier and Spirit Largest Airports March 2022 
Frontier and Spirit are large and will get larger in Florida and Las Vegas, the two biggest leisure destinations in the 
Continental US and also — not coincidentally — the largest places in Allegiant's operation. Spirit brings its legacy 
presence in Detroit along with Houston and Atlanta to the mix while Frontier adds Denver, of course, and Philly. 
Chicago is big for both, though Frontier has been shifting its service to Midway. 
This will help both airlines to increase coverage, but the differences go much deeper than this. There is a 
philosophical difference in how the airlines build their networks. 
Frequencies by Route March 2022 
Spirit has long had a focus on serving routes at least once a day. Sure, it has some that go less, but for Frontier, 
sub-daily is the airline's bread and butter. Now, you bring them together, and do the philosophies change? Does 
one win out? Or does it truly just become a combination of both, serving cities big and small with varying 
frequencies as needed? 
These are all questions that will be answered over time. We'll also see whether the Big Front Seat (domestic First 
Class with no extra service) survives or if Stretch seating (extra legroom coach) will win out. I find myself assuming 
that we'll see Stretch win if it pays for itself, which it probably does or Frontier would have given it up long ago. But 
we won't have any idea of the actual direction until we learn the management team's makeup. 
In the meantime, it's all about presenting sunshine and rainbows and convincing the feds to allow the merger to go 
through without a challenge. It's hard to see how a challenge would be successful here. What would they want the 
airline to give up? Gates in Orlando? Then again, this DOJ is doing odd things with the whole challenge of the 
American-JetBlue Northeast Alliance, so who knows what will happen. 
Overall, I like this merger, and I think it's been a long time coming. That being said, I should reserve my full 
judgment until we get more details than the sparse information we learned yesterday.

FTSE 100 made a nervy start ahead of the expected hike in heating bills and interest rates later today.
London's blue-chip index was up 9 at 7,592 in early deals.
Ofgem is expected to confirm a 50% rise in the energy price cap taking household bills near to £2,000 annually. 
The government may offer a £200 rebate per home to offset some of the extra cost.
Shell's annual profits surged to US$17bn compared with a US$20bn loss in 2020. This has prompted Labour to 
restate its call for a windfall tax on North Sea energy firms to help support struggling consumers.
Facebook parent Meta shed US$200bn, or 23% in value during after hours trading on disappointing financial 
results. Analysts were stunned by the first ever reduction in daily usage of the social media giant's platform.
Ryanair and British Airways are the worst short-haul airlines according to Which?, the consumer rights organisation, 
scoring extremely poorly on handling customer refunds and airline disruptions. A survey questioned more than 
1,300 passengers on flight experience and 1,100 about how an airline dealt with disruptions.
Among the small caps, Creo Medical expects revenues for the year just gone to come in ahead of forecasts and 
added that it 'continues to deliver' on its build, buy and partner strategy. The company, which is focused on the 
emerging field of surgical endoscopy, said sales for the 12 months to December would be around £25mln.
Caracal Gold meanwhile is accelerating its operational plan at its flagship Kilimapesa gold mine in Kenya. The 
decision follows the successful completion of the first two phases of development.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) was ranked as the worst short-haul airline by Which?, the consumer rights 
organisation, scoring extremely low on its handling customer refunds and airline disruptions.
The survey was split into two parts, with more than 1,300 passengers questioned on flight experience, such as 
customer service and value for money, and 1,100 surveyed for how an airline dealt with disruptions.
Ryanair scored 55% and 47% respectively in the two parts, with a fifth of customers saying they had to wait a 
month to get a refund.
One customer said: "Ryanair is the most awkward airline to deal with that I have ever come across. It seems to be 
proud of being difficult." 
Nearly 75% of customers said they would not fly with Ryanair when asked if there was an airline they would never 
consider.
British Airways finished second bottom, although it scored much lower than Ryanair on refund satisfaction.
Which? found that passengers would spend hours on hold, passed between departments before being hung up on.
Its poor customer service, along with a two-star rating for food and drink, seat comfort and value for money led to 
one customer describing it as a "budget style airline at premium prices."
Ryanair and British Airways ranked as worst airlines in survey
Jet2 ranked top of the table, with 84% of respondents satisfied with how Covid disrupted flights were handled, with 
most passengers receiving a refund within two weeks, and nine out of 10 customers receiving a full refund rather 
than a voucher.

Ryanair plans to add up to 6,000 new employees to its global workforce within the next five years to support a 
massive Boeing 737 MAX fleet expansion, according to comments made by the airline's executive team during a 
Jan. 31 earnings call.
Despite posting a net loss of (EURO)96 million for their third quarter fiscal year, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has 
a positive outlook for growth for the Dublin-based carrier that announced 720 new routes and 15 new bases over 
the last year and will need to train and hire new engineers, pilots and cabin crew to support its planned fleet growth. 
By 2026, Ryanair expects to grow its flight operations from a pre-COVID average of 149 million passengers 
annually to more than 225 million per year by 2026.
"We'll create 6,000 new jobs over the next five years, we're investing heavily in new people and training, we've 
opened a (EURO)50 million Dublin aviation training center, four full motion simulators, two fix-based simulators, 
cabin crew training facilities and we expect to open two more of those. One somewhere in the Iberian Peninsula 
and one in central to eastern Europe within the next two or three years," O'Leary said in a video statement released 
by Ryanair. "We're committed over the next five years to training and recruiting thousands of very high skilled, 
highly paid aviation professionals."
The start of the hiring and training expansion for Ryanair began back in September, when the airline announced the 
opening of its aviation training center located near Dublin Airport. Airline Flight Academy, a Dublin-based flight 
school, is the airline's exclusive training partner for the new facility.
Most of the training efforts for the new facility will go toward training engineers, pilots, and cabin crew to operate the 
Boeing 737-8200 "Gamechanger" aircraft that Ryanair is adding to its fleet. In December 2020, Ryanair increased 
its firm order for the 737-8200 from 135 to 210 firm orders.
"We're going to grow strongly over the next five years, we'll grow to about 620 aircraft in the fleet and with that, we'll 
see about 6,000 jobs created-high paying jobs, high skilled jobs for pilots, cabin crew, and engineers. We've 
already started the process of building out our training infrastructure," Neil Sorahan, CFO of Ryanair, said during a 
question and answer session with analysts.
Ryanair plans on hiring 6,000 cabin crew, engineers and pilots over the next five years
While both O'Leary and Sorahan admitted that the rise in the number of Europeans contracting the Omicron variant 
caused a noticeable setback in passenger demand and the number of flights completed during their third quarter, 
the hiring outlook is a massive turnaround from where the airline was at the beginning of the global pandemic. In 
May 2020, after a historic drop-off in the number of flights being operated, Ryanair announced plans to cut 3,000 
jobs-15% of its workforce-and enacted 20% pay cuts for its remaining staff.
Although O'Leary warns that another COVID-19 variant could lead to further disruptions, the 6,000 jobs being 
added in coming years will recoup all of the jobs it shed and add additional new staff to support its growth 
throughout Europe. One challenge remaining for Ryanair, though, could be the reduction in the number of non-
Ryanair 737s currently being operated by European airlines, which puts a strain on the number of available 
engineers and pilots for the aircraft type.
O'Leary, however, does not believe that will be a concern moving forward.
"I think the job opportunities for 737 pilots across Europe in the next number of years will largely be combined to 
Ryanair. We have the capacity to train all our own engineers, our own pilots and our own cabin crew," O'Leary said. 
"But given the cost of trying to retrain the 737 pilot onto an Airbus, I think if anything, there will be a lot less turnover 
of pilots here in Ryanair. We will essentially be the only 737 operator here in Europe in the next couple of years."
Ryanair currently has 1,000 total 737 pilots in training, and currently has the capacity to train up to a thousand pilots 
per year. That number will increase once the airline adds two additional aviation training centers, bringing the total 
number they operate in Europe to seven. aviationtoday.com

Last year marked half a century since Southwest Airlines commenced operations. In the five decades that have 
followed, the Dallas-based low-cost carrier has amassed a huge but uniform fleet consisting of more than 700 
aircraft from the same family.
Southwest Airlines' present fleet consists of an incredible 737 aircraft, dominated by the 737-700, making it the 
world's largest all-narrowbody airline. Of these aircraft, 460 are examples of the Boeing 737-700, making up 62.5% 
of the fleet. Historically, it has flown another 54 737-700s, according to data from ch-aviation.com.
Southwest's 737-700s are by far its oldest aircraft, clocking in at an average age of 17.4 years. Data from ch-
aviation lists 422 of the 460 examples as currently being active. Meanwhile, the remaining 38 of these twinjets are 
either in storage or undergoing maintenance.
According to data from SeatGuru, Southwest fits its 737-700s with an all-economy seating configuration that can 
accommodate 143 passengers. These seats are unassigned for passengers, with those first onboard getting the 
first pick.
Southwest Airlines also has a higher capacity variant from the 737NG ('Next Generation') series at its disposal, 
namely the popular 737-800. There are presently 207 examples of this design in the carrier's fleet, of which just four 
are inactive. Their average age is significantly lower than their smaller 737-700 counterparts, clocking in at just 6.5 
years old.
SeatGuru reports that Southwest Airlines' 737-800s have 175 seats onboard. Interestingly, this is noticeably lower 
than other low-cost users of the type. For instance, the examples flown by Ryanair, another large-scale 737-800 
operator, feature 189 seats. Southwest's less dense configuration and free checked bags have seen it win favor 
over its competitors.
The 737 MAX's growing role in a huge Southwest fleet. While the Boeing 737NG series represents the bulk of 
Southwest's present fleet, the new 737 MAX line is also beginning to have an increasing presence at the carrier. 
There are already 69 examples of the 175-seat 737 MAX 8 in its fleet, all of which are active. These next-generation 
narrowbodies are three years old on average.
Fleet Analysis: Southwest Airlines in 2022
Going forward, the 737 MAX will find itself playing a more even role with the 737 NG series at Southwest, as the 
latter aircraft begin to age and eventually retire. As of December 2021, Southwest Airlines operates the following 
aircraft and has 372 jets on order: <table class="wikitable"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Boeing Aircraft</th> <th>In 
service</th> <th>Orders</th> <th>Passengers</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Boeing 737-700</td>

737-700.</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Total</th> <th>737</th> <th>372</th> <th colspan="2"></th> </tr> </tbody> </table>
Since its inception, Southwest Airlines has almost exclusively operated Boeing 737 aircraft (except for a brief period 
when it leased and flew some Boeing 727-200 aircraft). Southwest is the world's largest operator of the Boeing 737, 
and was the launch customer of the 737-300, 737-500, and 737-700. <table class="wikitable"> <tbody> <tr>

<td>2016</td> <td></td> <td>Launch customer.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
Southwest has operated 88 examples of the 717-200, after completing the purchase of AirTran Airways. However, 
Southwest elected not to integrate them into its fleet and currently leases them to Delta Air Lines.. All in all, its 
historic, current, and future aircraft constitute an enormous all-time fleet of over 1,500 jets.

2021. Load factor was 79%, down from 81% in December but up from 69% a year ago. Ryanair traffic hit a peak 
last year of 11.3 million passengers in October, but the total has declined each month since.
For Wizz Air, passengers in January totalled 2.4 million, down from 2.6 million in December but up from 2.4 million 
in November and from 573,692 a year ago. Also more positively, load factor for Wizz was 79.6% in January, up 
from 75% in December and 76% in November.

million seats from 19.7 million in the Covid-hit year-earlier rolling 12 months.
Ryanair shares were up 0.7% at EUR16.88 in Dublin early Wednesday. Wizz was up 1.0% at 4,198.00 pence in

Feb 02, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week,Southwest Airlines LUV[1] reported earnings for fourth-quarter 2021. This was LUV's first 
profitable quarter after seven consecutive losses since the pandemic began in 2020. Alaska Air Group ALK[2] also 
delivered earnings for fourth-quarter 2021. Strong holiday travel demand and favorable pricing aided the December 
quarter's results. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[3], however, continued incurring a quarterly loss, its eighth successive setback. Omicron-
induced turbulence induced Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] to incur a wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter of 
fiscal 2022 (ended Dec 31, 2021). An expansion-related update from Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[5] was also 
available in the past week. 
Read the last Airline stock Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Alaska Air Group's fourth-quarter 
2021 earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of 24 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of 17 cents. In the year-ago period, ALK incurred a loss of $2.55. Operating revenues of $1,899 million 
outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,841.8 million. 
Alaska Air, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), expects first-quarter 2022 revenues to drop in the 14-
17% range. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 15-18%. The unfavorable guidance 
includes a 7-point headwind due to the trimming of capacity. ALK estimates economic fuel cost per gallon in the 
band of $2.45-$2.50.[7] 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8]. 
2. Southwest Airlines reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 14 
cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. In the year-ago period, LUV had 
incurred a loss of $1.29 per share. Strong holiday travel demand during November and December, as well as 
incremental revenues generated from the company's new co-brand credit card agreement, aided LUV's fourth-
quarter performance. 
Operating revenues of $5,051 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,029 million and also 
jumped more than 100% year over year. Due to Omicron-induced staffing issues and bad weather conditions, 
Southwest Airlines expects to incur a loss in the first quarter of 2022[9].

3. JetBlue incurred a fourth-quarter 2021 loss (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 36 cents per share, 
comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 40 cents. 
JetBlue expects first-quarter 2022capacity in the range of (1)-2% compared with the figure reported in the first 
quarter of 2019. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 13-15%. Total revenues are forecast to 
drop in the 11-16% range. Average fuel cost per gallon in the March quarter is estimated to be $2.59. Management 
expects the Omicron impact to be short term[10]. 
4. Ryanair Holdings incurred a loss of 48 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, wider than the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate by a penny. Results were hurt by Omicron-induced travel restrictions in December, which 
weakened close-in bookings and fares for Christmas and the New Year travel period. Quarterly revenues of 
$1,681.1 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,792.2 million but improved more than 400% from 
the year-ago period's actuals with a significant improvement in traffic owing to strong bookings in October and 
November. 
Ryanair's net loss for the quarter came in at €96 million compared with the year-ago quarter's loss of €321 million. 
Traffic soared more than 200% year over year to 31.1 million. Geographically, total revenues from Italy (comprised 
24.5% of the top line) climbed more than 200% year over year, while the same from Spain (17.6%) jumped more 
than 300%. Revenues from the United Kingdom (12.7%) and Ireland (5.3%) soared nearly 300% and more than 
400% year over year, respectively. Revenues from other European countries (39.9%) skyrocketed more than 300% 
year over year. 
5. With air-travel demand improving in the United States as more people get vaccinated every day, Allegiant Travel 
intends to increase options for its passengers this spring with its latest network expansion to vacation destinations 
like Nashville, Savannah, Roanoke and San Diego. ALGT announced nine new non-stop routes from its bases in 
the United States, offering more options for leisure travelers. 
This move comes when Allegiant Travel prepares for a busy spring season. Drew Wells, Allegiant's senior vice 
president of revenue and planning stated, 'We're thrilled to kick off 2022 with a network expansion in twelve of our 
markets'. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of 48 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Dec 31, 
2021), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the amount of loss narrowed by 70.4% 
year over year. Results were hurt by Omicron-induced travel restrictions in December, which weakened close-in 
bookings and fares for the Christmas and New Year travel period. 
Quarterly revenues of $1,681.1 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,792.2 million but improved 
more than 400% from the year-ago period with significant improvement in traffic owing to strong bookings in 
October and November. 
Ryanair's net loss for the quarter came in at €96 million compared with the year-ago quarter's loss of €321 million. 
Traffic soared more than 200% year over year to 31.1 million. Load factor in the period was 84%, reflecting an 
improvement of 14 percentage points from the year-ago period. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price, Consensus and EPS

 Geographically, total revenues from Italy (comprised of 24.5% of the top line) climbed more than 200% year over 
year, while the same from Spain (17.6%) jumped more than 300%. Revenues from United Kingdom (12.7%) and 
Ireland (5.3%) soared nearly 300% and more than 400% year over year, respectively. Revenues from other 
European countries (39.9%) skyrocketed more than 300% year over year. 
Scheduled revenues climbed more than 300% year over year due to increase in traffic and average fares. Ancillary 
revenues also jumped more than 300% year over year in the reported quarter due to strong performance in priority 
boarding and reserved seating, apart from robust traffic. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more than 
200% year over year due to rise in sectors flown and high jet fuel prices. Total operating expenses rose more than 
100% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), had cash of nearly €3 billion as of Dec 31, 2021, 
higher than €3.15 billion as of Mar 31, 2021.

United Airlines UAL[5], carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), incurred a loss (excluding 39 cents from non-
recurring items) of $1.60 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a 
loss of $2.23. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Q3 Loss Wider Than Expected, Revenues Up Y/Y
United Airlines' operating revenues of $8,192 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,930.9 
million. Both the top and bottom lines improved significantly year over year, thanks to strong holiday travel demand. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[6], carrying a Zacks Rank #5, reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 3 cents 
from non-recurring items) of 14 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. This 
marks the company's first profitable quarter after seven consecutive losses since the pandemic began in 2020. 
Southwest Airlines' operating revenues of $5,051 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,029 
million and also jumped more than 100% year over year. Strong holiday travel demand during November and 
December, as well as well as incremental revenues generated from the company's new co-brand credit card 
agreement, aided LUV's fourth-quarter performance. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[7], carrying a Zacks Rank #5, reported fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 86 cents from 
non-recurring items) of 22 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. Earnings came 
against the year-ago quarter's loss of $2.53 per share. Strong holiday travel demand and favorable pricing aided 
the December-quarter results. 
Delta's revenues came in at $9,470 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,232.1 million and 
skyrocketing more than 100% from the year-ago figure as people resorted to air travel during the holidays.

Minneapolis-headquartered Sun Country Airlines plans to acquire 15 mid-life Boeing 737-800 aircraft by the end of 
next year, according to its fleet plan.
The carrier operates 36 passenger and 12 freighter aircraft, according to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker. It 
recently leased a 737-800 aircraft from CDB Aviation as part of a two-aircraft transaction.
Its passenger fleet will grow to 50 units by the end of 2023.
The carrier says the focus is on the Boeing 737-800, "the LCC stalwart for airlines such as Southwest and Ryanair", 
adding that Covid has created "unique opportunities" to acquire mid-life aircraft at even cheaper rates.
Sun Country maintains a policy of no OEM orderbooks.
"No order book is an advantage versus our competitors that are locked into expensive pre-COVID aircraft prices," it 
says.
The ultra-low-cost carrier swung to net income of $14 million in the three months ended 30 September from a $40 
million loss in the same period last year.
Revenue increased over 120% year on year to $174 million and was 16% higher compared with revenue of $149 
million in the second quarter.
Net debt for the third quarter amounted to $267 million. Total liquidity was $300 million.
Sun Country Airlines will announce its fourth quarter and full year results on 8 February 2022.

Ryanair said it would discount flights to stimulate demand, after the spread of the Omicron variant dented bookings 
in the final three months of 2021. The airline warned of "huge uncertainty" for pricing and yields through to the end 
of its financial year in March, adding that investors should expect further disruption to air travel. "I wouldn't rule out 
one more twist before we're over the other side of this," Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the 
Financial Times.
The low-cost airline reported a net loss of (EURO)96mn, compared with a (EURO)321mn loss in the same quarter a 
year earlier. Revenues were (EURO)1.5bn from 31mn passengers in its third quarter ending on December 31.
The Irish carrier suffered a drop in bookings and cut January flying schedules after European governments 
reimposed tougher border restrictions at the end of last year in response to the rapid spread of the Omicron strain.
Ryanair echoed rivals Wizz Air and easyJet, which last week predicted a resurgence in bookings for summer 
holidays after a bleak winter. "We have noticed an uptick in bookings in the last couple of weeks as the UK 
government has removed restrictions," said
Sorahan. "There remains a fair bit of policy uncertainty for the next couple of months as governments hopefully roll 
off travel restrictions."
Following the "steep declines" in filled seats on flights, Ryanair said passengers were still booking at the last 
minute, and "significant price stimulation at lower prices" would be needed for air travel to recover. The airline 
Ryanair to discount flights after Omicron hit Airlines
reaffirmed its expectations that it would fly just under 100mn passengers this financial year and stuck by full-year 
financial guidance issued in December, forecasting a net loss of (EURO)250mn to (EURO)450mn.
Ryanair has been expanding aggressively during the Covid-19 crisis, which has bankrupted some rivals and 
pushed others, such as TAP, to cut capacity.
The Irish airline plans to grow by more than 50 per cent over prepandemic levels by its 2026 financial year. It will 
launch 720 new routes in the year starting from April, as well as negotiate low airport costs and expand its fleet. It 
plans to add 24 of Boeing's 737 Max planes before summer to the 41 already taken, helping to boost capacity by 14 
per cent over the 2019 peak.
Sorahan argued cheap tickets meant the airline would be well positioned to attract customers hit by inflation. See

Airlines have had a torrid couple of years as travel restrictions grounded planes. But passengers are now slowly 
returning, lured by steeply discounted fares. Low-cost carrier Ryanair has the financial wherewithal to endure those 
lower prices. It anticipates carrying 225mn passengers a year in 2026.
It turns out, no matter what the ads say, Ryanair's fares are not low enough. The discount airline has warned of an 
annual net loss of between (EURO)250mn and (EURO)450mn as it struggles to get customers on board.
That range, reiterated yesterday just two months before the fiscal year closes, is wide enough to fly a widebodied 
jet through. It highlights the travails of an industry that is forecast to lose an aggregate $11.6bn this year.
While political mood music over Covid-19 has turned upbeat in most western nations, curbs remain on European 
travel. Would-be tourists, wary of planning trips in the next couple of months, wait to be seduced into last-minute 
trips by low fares.
And these are legion: tomorrow you can fly from London to Venice for less than a Tube ticket from the City to 
Wimbledon.
More fare-slashing will follow. Ryanair's third-quarter numbers already bear the scars. Average fares at (EURO)25 
dropped by a quarter, compared with the same three months pre-Covid. Despite this, the load factor wallows at 84 
per cent, down from pre-pandemic levels of 95-96 per cent.
However, reservations at the main low-cost carriers reveal passengers are booking for Easter and the summer. 
Ryanair offers investors key comforts.
Ryanair : lost horizon Twitter : @FTLex
Its balance sheet is far from clear, there is net debt of (EURO)2.1bn that it wants to erase over two years. But its 
Boeing 737 fleet is 90 per cent unencumbered.
Investors pay for that relative safety, and cost control. Ryanair, measured on an enterprise value-to-estimated 2023 
ebitda, flies higher than budget London-listed peers Wizz, easyJet and Jet2. Average cost per passenger, ex-fuel, 
dropped to (EURO)32 in the past period, compared with (EURO)33 in the same period pre-Covid. Ryanair now 
boasts 41 Boeing 737 planes and reckons on having about 65 come summer. These burn 16 per cent less fuel, 
which Ryanair anyway hedges into next year.
As shown by countless instances of war and pestilence, it operates in a sector in permanent thrall to external 
forces. Though Ryanair shares are rarely cheap, patient investors can expect them to offer safe exposure for when 
the weather clears.

Airlines have had a torrid couple of years as travel restrictions grounded planes. But passengers are now slowly 
returning, lured by steeply discounted fares. Low-cost carrier Ryanair has the financial wherewithal to endure those 
lower prices. It anticipates carrying 225mn passengers a year in 2026.
It turns out, no matter what the ads say, Ryanair's fares are not low enough. The discount airline has warned of an 
annual net loss of between (EURO)250mn and (EURO)450mn as it struggles to get customers on board.
That range, reiterated yesterday just two months before the fiscal year closes, is wide enough to fly a widebodied 
jet through. It highlights the travails of an industry that is forecast to lose an aggregate $11.6bn this year.
While political mood music over Covid-19 has turned upbeat in most western nations, curbs remain on European 
travel. Would-be tourists, wary of planning trips in the next couple of months, wait to be seduced into last-minute 
trips by low fares.
And these are legion: tomorrow you can fly from London to Venice for less than a Tube ticket from the City to 
Wimbledon.
More fare-slashing will follow. Ryanair's third-quarter numbers already bear the scars. Average fares at (EURO)25 
dropped by a quarter, compared with the same three months pre-Covid. Despite this, the load factor wallows at 84

UN agency says gaps in Belarus flight rerouting probe
UN agency says gaps in Belarus flight rerouting probe

Feb 01, 2022( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 The UN aviation agency on Monday extended its investigation into a bomb warning aboard a Ryanair flight last 
May, citing gaps and inconsistencies in Belarus's account of its rerouting of the aircraft. 
 The flight from Greece to Lithuania on May 23, 2021 was forced to land in Minsk, where Belarusian authorities 
arrested two passengers, journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega. 
 After reviewing a report on the International Civil Aviation Organization's fact-finding investigation of the incident, 
the agency's 36-member board 'requested the ICAO investigation team to continue its work.' 
 In a statement, the Montreal-based agency said some ICAO Council members 'expressed concern at the gaps in 
information provided by Belarus and the inconsistences contained in the evidence available at the time of the 
investigation in relation to crucial aspects of the factual reconstruction of the events.' 
 It also pointed to 'newly emerging information relating to the FR4978 events and timeline,' but provided no details. 
 The report, which AFP has viewed, found the bomb warning was 'deliberately false.' 
 Belarus authorities, including President Alexander Lukashenko, have maintained that the plane was diverted to 
Minsk because of the threat of a bomb on board. 
 The ICAO report confirmed that searches of the plane upon departure and arrival did not produce a bomb, and said 
therefore 'it is considered that the bomb threat was deliberately false.' 
 However, the investigation 'was unable to attribute the commission of this act of unlawful interference to any 
individual or state,' the report said. 
 The report, which breaks down the day in question minute by minute, does show Belarus concealing information 
crucial to the investigation. 
 The US Justice Department last week named two Belarusian officials accused of organizing the plot in an 
unprecedented judicial move coming just as tensions rise between the United States and Belarus ally Russia. 
 The United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union in June slapped economic sanctions on the country 
and individual sanctions on Lukashenko over the ordeal.

easyJet plc (LSE:EZJ) is still a buy with broker UBS, which anticipates increased bookings in the months leading to 
and including summer, with its target share price increased to 815p from 775p. 
The broker highlights that while fuel prices continue to rise easyJet is 60% hedged at US$504/MT and believes fare 
pressures shouldn't deter customers from flying given pent-up demand to travel.  
easyJet also possesses strong liquidity of £3bn and is rated at a discount to Ryanair and Wizz Air. 
The impact of EU travel restrictions is also being overstated believes the broker, with key markets such as the UK 
now opening up again.
UBS has adjusted its forecasted earnings for 2022, down by 11% due to rising fuel costs, but has upgraded the 
following year by roughly 7% and has increased confidence surrounding holiday and travel market.  
easyJet shares were up 2.7%, changing hands at 616p in afternoon trading.

COLOURFUL Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said yesterday the world had not left Covid-19 behind as he warned of 
further uncertainty to come.
The low-cost airline reported a loss of £80m in the three months to December and warned investors not to expect 
only clear skies ahead.
"We would caution all shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the 
world can finally declare that the Covid crisis is behind us," he said on an analyst call.
O'Leary said he expected passenger demand to hit 90 per cent of prepandemic levels by April, moving ahead of 
that in the summer.

Ryanair prepares price cuts as it warns of 'hugely uncertain' financial outlook

Feb 01, 2022( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair is preparing to slash prices to lure customers back on to its planes before the spring, as it warned of a 
'hugely uncertain' financial outlook. 
The Irish-listed carrier said 'media hysteria' over the Omicron variant had worsened its losses in the last quarter of 
2021 and shareholders could expect further disruption from Covid, although it was gearing up to run more flights 
overall this summer than before the coronavirus pandemic struck. 
 Ryanair made a loss of €96m (80m) in the last three months of last year - despite revenues four times higher than 
the autumn of 2020, when stricter international travel restrictions were still in place. 
 Its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said the first three months of 2022 would require 'significant price stimulation 
at lower prices' to attract customers. The airline cut its capacity for January by a third after December passenger 
numbers dropped 1.5 million below forecast after Omicron hit travel. 
 O'Leary said recent bookings had improved after the easing of travel restrictions but passengers were still booking 
later and nearer departure. The airline did not change its forecast for a full-year loss to March of €250m-€450m - a 
wider than usual range. 
 O'Leary added: 'This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we 
would caution all shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the 
world can finally declare that the Covid crisis is behind us.' 
 The chief financial officer said the legacy of the pandemic could mean a long-term change to airline practices, 
including wearing masks on board. 
 Neil Sorahan told the Telegraph: 'Masks will be something that will be with us for a while longer to come. It's a bit 
like after 9/11, we ended up with our toiletries in plastic bags, maybe we'll have to live with masks for a while 
longer.' 
 The current high price of fuel was not a concern, Sorahan said: 'We're the best-hedged airline in Europe at the 
moment - fuel trading over $91 a barrel this morning we've locked in our fuel requirements at $60 a barrel so we're 
in very good position on that over the next 15 months.' 
Ryanair prepares price cuts as it warns of 'hugely uncertain' financial outlook
 Ryanair meanwhile retained ambitions to open bases in Ukraine, should tensions with its neighbour recede, 
O'Leary said: 'If it is not invaded by Russia, it is a country where we would expect to open a couple of bases Some 
time in the next two or three years subject to agreements on costs.' 
 Route planners had visited Ukraine again this month but the authorities were not in a position to discuss Ryanair's 
expansion plans, O'Leary said, 'as they were somewhat otherwise distracted'. 
 The airline is targeting growth to 225 million passengers a year by 2026, and has taken delivery of 41 Boeing 737 
Max aircraft, after years of delays after design flaws caused two fatal crashes. 
 O'Leary has repeatedly described the Boeing 737 Max as a 'game-changer' for the airline, offering lower costs and 
lower carbon emissions per flight. 
 However, its overall footprint will grow: the planned 50% growth over the next five years would be accompanied by 
only a 16% reduction in fuel use per new plane. It hopes to cut fuel use per passenger by another 10% over the 
next decade by using synthetic fuels, which are not currently available at scale. 
 Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, a stockbroker, said Ryanair was positioned for a strong recovery, adding: 
'There is growing industry optimism that summer 2022 could represent a near-normal trading period, with strong 
pent-up demand exceeding restrained industry capacity, so long as international travel restrictions continue to 
ease.'

A number of European airlines have adjusted their schedules to Kyiv Boryspil to avoid overnighting their aircraft at 
the airport as the risk of a further Russian invasion looms.
Lufthansa overnight flight LH2546/2547 from Munich was rescheduled between January 22 and January 26 to 
operate as a morning rotation. The original schedule, with the aircraft spending the night on the Boryspil apron, was 
restored as of January 28. The airline told Reuters that the change was purely for operational reasons. Sister carrier 
Austrian Airlines (OS, Vienna) reduced its OS667/668 rotation from Vienna to a weekly service but continues to 
overnight the aircraft in Kyiv.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines cancelled its overnight flight KL1387/1382 from Amsterdam Schiphol as of January 23. It 
operated the rotation on January 29, although the departure from the Netherlands was delayed by nearly five hours 
to avoid overnight parking at Kyiv airport.
Swiss has also adjusted its schedules for services from Zurich. Ryanair confirmed to Al Jazeera news that it has 
reduced the number of its flights to/from Ukraine. Out of non-based airlines, airBaltic appears to be the only one 
that has not tweaked its overnighting schedules over the last few days.
Russia is said to be gathering significant troop numbers near its border with Ukraine, as well as in Belarus, which 
borders Ukraine from the north, promoting concerns that Moscow may make further incursions into its eastern 
neighbour. Russia has been occupying the Crimea peninsula in southern Ukraine since 2014, while pro-Russian 
separatists have established two de facto states in Ukraine's eastern region of Donbas.

Ryanair Slashes Losses But Omicron Hit Winter Bookings
Ryanair Slashes Losses But Omicron Hit Winter Bookings

Jan 31, 2022( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair slashed losses in the final quarter of 2021 but the emergence of the Omicron variant cut into the normally 
busy winter holiday travel season, the no-frills airline said Monday. 
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the reporting period started well, with strong bookings as there was "less 
confusion" about the British government's "absurd 'traffic light system'" to rank Covid risks from countries. 
Britain is a key market for the airline based in neighbouring Ireland and which flies throughout Europe. 
Bookings continued to improve in November but "the sudden emergence of the Omicron variant" and "the media 
hysteria it generated" forced European governments to reimpose travel restrictions towards the end of the quarter, 
O'Leary said. 
The measures in the runup to Christmas "significantly weakened peak" Christmas and New Year bookings and 
fares, he said. 
Net losses stood at 96 million euros ($107 million) in the company's third quarter, a third of the figure for the same 
period in 2020.

restrictions in December Photo: AFP / Tobias SCHWARZ  
Ryanair said its full-year traffic forecast was unchanged at "just under 100 million passengers". 
Its net loss guidance stayed at between 250 million and 450 million euros. 
"This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we would caution all 
shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions," O'Leary warned. 
The UK government in December reimposed stricter travel rules -- including mandatory pre-arrival tests and self-
isolation until travellers had tested negative -- after a surge in cases due to Omicron. 
However, the travel measures are being eased, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued they were having a 
"limited impact" while imposing "significant costs" on the industry. 
The government will scrap compulsory Covid tests from February 11 for fully jabbed arrivals and quarantine for 
unvaccinated travellers. 
Currently, fully vaccinated arrivals are required to take a lateral flow test within two days, while those not jabbed 
must self-isolate for 10 days and take several tests before and after travel. 
Ryanair Slashes Losses But Omicron Hit Winter Bookings
British rival EasyJet last week said it had slashed losses by half in the final three months of 2021.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said the rebound in flying was knocked back in the last three 
months of 2021 by the outbreak of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, as it cautioned shareholders to expect further 
disruptions from the virus pandemic.
The Dublin-based budget carrier reported a net loss of EUR96 million in the three months that ended December 31, 
its financial third quarter. This was narrowed from the third quarter of financial 2021, for which Ryanair reported a 
loss of EUR321 million. However, it was double the net loss of EUR48 million for the entire first half of the year. 
Revenue was EUR1.47 billion, multiplied year-on-year from EUR340 million. However, this was 18% down from the 
previous quarter ending September 30, which brought in revenue of EUR1.78 billion. 
Ryanair said the emergence of the Omicron variant in December had "badly damaged" bookings and yields in 
December and January, which is typically a higher-yielding period with Christmas and New Year bookings. Traffic in 
December dropped to 9.5 million, 14% below the company's expected target of 11 million, and reduced the month's 
load factor to 81%. 
The quarter had started off well in October, with strong bookings for the mid-term break, and the relaxation of the 
UK government's traffic light system of travel restrictions. October traffic was 11.2 million, with an 84% load factor. 
November followed with 10.2 million guests, at a 86% load factor, at lower fares.
The quarter overall saw the airline carry 31.1 million passengers, which was up from 8.1 million the previous year, 
when even more travel restrictions were in place. 
Ryanair said that heading into its final quarter, capacity has been cut by 33% and January's traffic target has been 
lowered to between 6 million and 7 million passengers from 10 million.  
TOP NEWS: Ryanair says Omicron cut festive flying, still hurting fares
"The outlook for pricing and yields for the remainder of FY22 is hugely uncertain," the company said. Bookings have 
improved since travel restrictions were eased, but are still "very late and close-in". This will mean the final quarter 
has needed "significant price stimulation at lower prices" to recover load factors from the drop over the festive 
period. 
Ryanair maintained its guidance for a financial 2022 net loss in a larger-than-normal range of EUR250 million to 
EUR450 million. This would good progress from a loss of EUR1.11 billion in the previous year. However, it is still far 
from pre-pandemic profit of EUR648.7 million two years ago. The airline still expects total traffic of just under 100 
million passengers for the year. 
"This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we would caution all 
shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the world can finally 
declare that the Covid crisis is behind us," Ryanair warned. 
The airline's share price was down 0.4% to 16.54 pence each in Dublin on Monday morning.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) reported a much-improved loss for the festive quarter but cautioned investors 
to "expect further Covid disruptions" as bookings in December and January were hit by the coronavirus omicron 
variant.
The Dublin-based budget airline made (EURO)1.47bn of revenue for its third quarter to end-December, up 331% 
year-on-year, with losses cut to (EURO)96mln from (EURO)321mln a year earlier. 
This was in line with the City analyst consensus after the carrier slashed guidance just before Christmas. 
Boss Michael O'Leary said recent bookings have improved following easing of travel restrictions, but "the booking 
curve remains very late and close-in", suggesting passengers are making last-minute decisions.
He said flights in the current quarter were requiring "significant price stimulation at lower prices" to quickly fill 
planes.  
Ryanair kept its full-year guidance unchanged, but warned trading was "hugely sensitive" to any new developments 
in the pandemic.
Broker Liberum said: "The easing of international travel restrictions is key to the summer outlook. Ryanair is 
positioned for a strong recovery, with planned summer capacity at 114% of 2019 levels."

 Ryanair (RY4C.IR) called on other airlines to avoid the Belarusian airspace if the government does not guarantee 
that it would no longer repeat the forced diversion of its flight in 2021, Reuters reported Monday, citing Chief 
Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
A United Nations report determined that the reported bomb threat, which Belarus used to justify the forced landing, 
was "deliberately false." Meanwhile, Belarus authorities claimed that they acted legally and in accordance with 
international policies.
O'Leary noted that it is "fundamental" for air travel that the incident is no longer up for repetition.

 Ryanair slashed losses in the final quarter of 2021 but the emergence of the Omicron variant cut into the normally 
busy winter holiday travel season, the no-frills airline said Monday. 
 Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the reporting period started well, with strong bookings as there was 'less 
confusion' about the British government's 'absurd 'traffic light system'' to rank Covid risks from countries. 
 Britain is a key market for the airline based in neighbouring Ireland and which flies throughout Europe. 
 Bookings continued to improve in November but 'the sudden emergence of the Omicron variant' and 'the media 
hysteria it generated' forced European governments to reimpose travel restrictions towards the end of the quarter, 
O'Leary said. 
 The measures in the runup to Christmas 'significantly weakened peak' Christmas and New Year bookings and 
fares, he said. 
 Net losses stood at 96 million euros ($107 million) in the company's third quarter, a third of the figure for the same 
period in 2020. 
- 'Expect further Covid disruptions - 
Ryanair said its full-year traffic forecast was unchanged at 'just under 100 million passengers'. 
 Its net loss guidance stayed at between 250 million and 450 million euros. 
 'This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we would caution all 
shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions,' O'Leary warned. 
 The UK government in December reimposed stricter travel rules — including mandatory pre-arrival tests and self-
isolation until travellers had tested negative — after a surge in cases due to Omicron. 
 However, the travel measures are being eased, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued they were having a 
'limited impact' while imposing 'significant costs' on the industry. 
 The government will scrap compulsory Covid tests from February 11 for fully jabbed arrivals and quarantine for 
unvaccinated travellers. 
 Currently, fully vaccinated arrivals are required to take a lateral flow test within two days, while those not jabbed 
must self-isolate for 10 days and take several tests before and after travel. 
Ryanair slashes losses but Omicron hit winter bookings
 British rival EasyJet last week said it had slashed losses by half in the final three months of 2021.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported Monday that its third-quarter net loss was 96 
million euros as Omicron severely damaged peak Christmas & New Year bookings and fares. However, the loss 
was narrower than last year's loss of 321 million euros.
 Revenue surged 331 percent to 1.47 billion euros from prior year's 0.34 billion euros. Scheduled revenues 
increased 345 percent to 0.79 billion euros as traffic recovered strongly.
 The company said its third-quarter traffic rebounded strongly by 286 percent to 31.1 million customers from 8.1 
million customers last year.
 Load Factor also improved 14 percentage points to 84 percent from 70 percent percent a year ago.
 Looking ahead, Ryanair said its full year traffic forecast remains unchanged at 'just under' 100 million passengers, 
but due to Covid uncertainty the FY22 net loss guidance remains within a wider than normal range of 250 million 
euros to 450 million euros.
 The company previously expected FY22 loss between 100 million euros to 200 million euros.
 The company said the outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow.

 Ryanair[1] is being 'wary and cautious' on new Covid-variants popping up in the next three to six months. Without 
them, the Irish carrier should have a strong end of its FY22 and start of FY23, which begins in April. Omicron has 
spoiled December, January, and part of February, but the low-cost carrier expects a strong recovery from mid-
February. This should lead to 114-115 percent capacity in the coming summer, it said on January 31 in its Q3 
results. Price stimulation continues to eat into Ryanair's yields. 
 The October-December quarter started strong, but after the emergence of Omicron and the 'media hysteria' that 
caused governments to go into new restrictions, the crucial Christmas season partly collapsed. Instead of the 
projected eleven million passengers, Ryanair carried 9.5 million in December. It responded with a 33 percent 
capacity reduction for January. It now expects to carry around seven million passengers this quarter, the high-end 
of its previous guidance[2] of six to seven million. 
 During Q3, Ryanair reported a €96 million net loss compared to €321 million in the same quarter in 2020. 
Revenues were up to €1.47 billion from €340 million, with ancillary revenues eight percent higher to €22 per 
passenger. The airline carried 31.1 million passengers this quarter, up from 8.1 million in Q3 FY2021. The load 
factor was 84 percent, the highest of all European carriers. Operating costs increased 136 percent to €1.59 billion, 
mainly due to higher variable costs like fuel, operating and handling, and route charges, offset by fuel efficiencies by 
flying more Boeing MAX aircraft. 
 The Irish carrier said in 2020 that it would no longer fully hedge fuel. It has hedged over sixty percent of fuel for the 
current fourth quarter with jet swaps and caps. In the first six months of FY23 (April-September), fuel has been 
hedged eighty percent and the second half at seventy percent. It also has fully hedged carbon credits for the full 
FY22 and eighty percent of FY23. 
Ryanair bussy recruiting pilots and cabin staff 
Despite the capacity reduction for this month, Ryanair keeps all its staff current. It has agreed on new and extended 
pay deals with employees. Currently, some 1.000 pilots and up to 2.000 cabin crew are being recruited and trained, 
with up to 6.000 new staff to be recruited in the five next years. The carrier says it has no staffing issues right now, 
but labor flexibility in the post-Brexit UK is causing some concerns. It also negotiated new long-term contracts with 
various airports and will open fifteen new bases and 720 new routes, although it ended its contract with Frankfurt 
Price stimulation continues to eat into Ryanair 's yields
Airport as it thought its fares are too high. The airline will base some 21 aircraft in Vienna to strengthen its position 
here and grow capacity in Ireland and Portugal too.  
 At the end of December, Ryanair had just under €3.0 billion in cash plus €10 billion in assets, including ninety 
percent as an unencumbered fleet. Total debt stood at €5.1 billion, of which €2.1 billion in net debt, down from €2.3 
billion in March. The airline plans to reduce its debt as quickly as possible. It already repaid 600 million it received in 
payroll support under the UK's CCFF facility in October, five months earlier than was scheduled. 
MAX 8200 fleet to grow to 65 this summer  
On the fleet, Ryanair has grown its MAX 8200 'Gamechanger' fleet to 41 until December 31, thanks to higher 
deliveries from Boeing. It expects another 24 aircraft until this summer to bring the total to 65 MAX 8200s, a year 
later than originally planned. The carrier has210 high-capacity MAX[3] on order, which will be distributed over 
Ryanair, Malta Air, and Buzz. Fuel burn of the MAX is better than the advertised sixteen percent. Buzz currently has 
55 Boeing 737-800s and MAX 8200s, Malta Air some 140, Lauda 29 Airbus A320ceo's, and Ryanair UK operates 
with just under ten aircraft. CEO Michael O'Leary said that he currently isn't in negotiations with Boeing or Airbus for 
more aircraft. He still regretted that he and Boeing have beenunable to clinch a deal[4] on the MAX 10 after they 
couldn't agree on the price. 
 The recovery that Ryanair is seeing with close-in bookings from mid-February comes at a price. It continues price 
stimulation with low fares to keep load factors up, but this eats into its revenues and yields. 'Pricing remains very 
sensitive to new flow In our build-up, we are aggressively selling low fares than we would have before', said 
O'Leary. It maintains its FY22 guidance for a €250 to €450 million full-year loss and 100 million passengers carried. 
But if the recovery continues, Ryanair should be on track to grow to 225 million passengers in FY26. For this, it will 
need a fleet of 620-630 aircraft, so it has decided to keep some of its Boeing 737-800s on for longer instead of 
selling them off.

Shell, BT Group and Vodafone and Bank of England hike in the diary as February begins
Shell, BT Group and Vodafone and Bank of England hike in the diary as 
February begins

Body
Several FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 names are due to update investors in the coming week, including Shell, BT 
Group, Vodafone, Glencore, Compass and Virgin Money. 
A widely expected second Bank of England rate hike in as many months will dominate the domestic agenda for the 
week, while the new month of February brings a torrent of economic data, including the big US jobs report at the 
end of the week. 
US earnings highlights in the coming week include tech titans Alphabet, Amazon, AMD, Meta Platforms 
(Facebook), Qualcomm, Snap and Spotify; carmakers Ford Motor and General Motors; energy giants 
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and ExxonMobil; and big pharma pair Eli Lilly and Merck. 
MONDAY 31 JAN 
Ryanair
On Monday, as the last day of January will bring some extra month-end flows on stock markets as major investors 
carry out portfolio rebalancing. 
In company news, there will be quarterly numbers from Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), which while no longer 
listed in London post-Brexit, is still of interest to sector followers and those interested in the Dublin-quoted airline.  
Shell, BT Group and Vodafone and Bank of England hike in the diary as February begins
Just before Christmas, the budget carrier warned that profits for the year would be worse than previous guidance as 
Christmas and New Year bookings were hit by the coronavirus Omicron variant and associated travel restrictions 
across Europe.  
But Ryanair, along with rivals easyJet and Wizz Air, said this month that they will add capacity to meet an expected 
a surge in people heading to sunnier climes. 
For its third quarter just past, revenue is forecast to come in at (EURO)1.5bn with a loss before tax of 
(EURO)81mln, said broker Peel Hunt, predicting that with forward bookings for the summer increasing rapidly "an 
uplift in yields more than sufficient to mitigate rising fuel and carbon prices". 
In macro matters, Monday may see some examination of Chinese manufacturing data from the weekend, plus EU 
gross domestic product numbers.  
TUESDAY 1 FEB 
Viring Money UK
Ahead of its bigger banking rivals later in the month, Virgin Money UK PLC (LSE:VMUK) will kick off the sector's 
reporting season, reporting on the three months to 31 December, the first quarter of its fiscal year. 
Back in November, chief executive David Duffy hailed the challenger bank's return to statutory pre-tax profits and 
the improved net interest margin (NIM), reduced costs, improved impairments and strong capital levels that enabled 
a proposed reinstatement of dividends. 
Virgin Money also last year said it would accelerate the next stage of its 'digital first' strategy, including the 
development of a digital wallet to rival the fintech unicorns chomping into the banking sector's breakfast. 
In this update investors and analysts will be looking for comment on what is an intense mortgage market, as well as 
movement in NIM and guidance for future periods, given the Bank of England rate hike in December and another 
one potentially this week.  
Analysts at Peel Hunt predict upside to the 1.72% consensus NIM estimate for the full year, compared to 1.62% in 
2021, but with the challenger having warned twice on costs it "needs to avoid further slippage from the current 
guidance for flat underlying costs". 
Macro matters 
There will be lending and money supply data from the Bank of England ahead of its meeting later in the week.  
Manufacturing numbers from Markit will also be supplied for the UK, Europe and US, which were all pointing to 
growth last time around.  
Building society Nationwide will also supply its UK house price numbers.  
Last time its measure of house price growth showed a modest 0.2% month-to-month in December, the smallest rise 
since September pushing the year-on-year growth to 9.3%, its slowest pace since April 2021. 
WEDNESDAY 2 FEB 
Vodafone 
Vodafone PLC has struggled to get revenues moving forward in recent years but showed some progress at the half-
way point. 
The telecom giant also upped its earning target for this year although the headlines recently have been more 
around possible deals both for and by the company. 
Shell, BT Group and Vodafone and Bank of England hike in the diary as February begins
Reports last week said it made an approach to buy rival 3 and it is talking to Italian group Iliad. 
A merger of its Vantage Towers arm with Deutsche Telekom's mast business has also been mooted. 
Vodafone itself meanwhile is said to be a private equity target, which has sparked a modest share rally but done 
little to improve the dismal long-term performance. 
Some decent numbers in Wednesday's third quarter update would be handy if it wants to quieten the chatter. 
Glencore 
Fans of announcements with tables full of figures are in for a treat when Glencore PLC (LSE:GLEN) releases its 
2021 production report. 
There is sure to be some commentary from chief executive Gary Nagle as well and some guidance on 2022 
production levels, just to break up the wall of stats. 
The commodities trader and miner told investors last month that there is a "generally steady overall production 
profile in the 2022-2024 outlook period, with zinc volumes lower in 2024, in line with mine closures". 
THURSDAY 3 FEB 
Bank of England
On Thursday, it is being widely predicted that the Bank of England will raise interest rates for the second month in a 
row, which will be the first such double-whammy since 2004. 
With inflation running well above 5% and the labour market as tight as it has ever been in recent memory the 
Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) needs to step up, said Deutsche Bank's chief UK economist, Sanjay 
Raja. 
"In the week ahead, we're expecting the MPC to turn the page on its ultra easy policy stance [...and...] to confirm 
the start of (passive) quantitative tightening (QT) with reinvestments dropping out of the Bank's balance sheet from 
next week onwards.  
"This will be the first time ever that the Bank has embarked in QT, since the introduction of QE more than a decade 
ago." 
READ MORE: What the BoE interest rate hike means for investors and markets   
More hikes are likely later this year and in 2023, he said, given the "scale and persistence" of inflation, with 
Deutsche forecasting another hike to 0.75% in August.  
Two more hikes are quite possible next year to take the rate up to 1.25% - but if inflation and wages continue to 
remain toppy, here is a quite real possibility that "more will be needed and perhaps at a faster pace". 
Others, such as Rabobank, are less hawkish, predicting a BoE hike next week but only one or two more after but 
they agree that the central bank's policy is "hostage to fortune". 
Shell
It'll be hard to look past rising oil prices and a growing cash pile at Shell PLC (LSE:RDSB) on Thursday, with 
investors of different hues arguing over cash returns and sustainability investments. 
Moreover, it may be hard for the oil major to avoid appearing mealy mouthed when it comes to energy transition 
and 'net zero' amidst an embarrassment of cash due with crude oil at US$90 per barrel (and forecast, by some, to 
see US$100 again in the near future).
Shell, BT Group and Vodafone and Bank of England hike in the diary as February begins
Shell will have enjoyed a 60% surge in oil sale prices over the past twelve months, with the City analyst consensus 
pointing to Shell making a profit of around US$21bn versus US$4.8bn last year.
For Q4 alone, profit is seen coming in at US$8.8bn versus US$393mln. Cash flow amounted to some US$6bn in 
the months between July and September (and oil prices are higher still since then).
What will Shell do with all that wonga, one might wonder. It's becoming more of a conundrum as management will 
likely be treading an ESG tightrope as they eye fresh investments - bonanza dividends or share buy-backs may 
prove the least controversial.
BT Group
In company news, former telecoms monopoly BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) is being closely followed by many 
investors over takeover speculation. 
But while French tech billionaire and 18% shareholder Patrick Drahi says he is not planning a bid, BT has other big 
issues to deal with, including the fibre roll-out of its broadband arm Openreach's and its pension fund deficit. 
In November, the telco said its fibre roll-out had reach 6mln customers with build costs falling. 
An update on progress with the roll-out will be a key feature in Thursday's update especially with analyst worries 
about rival infrastructure networks being built by the likes of Virgin Media O2. 
Revenues and earnings have been going nowhere for years so anything other than a modest increase/decrease on 
the second quarter's revenues of £5.24bn and £1.9bn underlying earnings will be a surprise. 
Compass 
To misquote John Lennon in previewing the trading update from contract caterer Compass Group PLC (LSE:CPG), 
so that was Christmas and how well have you done? 
The company will issue a trading update covering October to December, the first quarter of its fiscal year - a year 
that the group said will be weighted towards the second half. 
As such, investors may not worry too much if the company falls behind the run rate on its full-year target of organic 
growth of 20-25% so long as it does not fall too far behind. 
The company certainly has some catching up to do on the profit margins front, according to analyst Matt Britzman 
at Hargreaves Lansdown. 
"At 4.5% last we heard, there's a lot of work left to do before the group returns to its target of over 7%. The group's 
looking to pass 6% this year," the analyst said. 
"We're interested to hear whether restrictions and an increase in Omicron fear over the past few months has 
impacted sales and, if so, whether that's likely to continue into the second quarter," Britzman added. 
FRIDAY 4 FEB 
Non-farm payrolls 
The first Friday of the month means its US non-farm payrolls (NFP) day - a big event for stock market watchers. 
November's and December's NFPs were very weak on the headline level, though on other measures the reports 
were decent.  
In December, the US economy added 199k jobs, an 11-month low, and well below the 450k consensus forecast. 
Shell, BT Group and Vodafone and Bank of England hike in the diary as February begins
With the NFP figure coming in below economists' forecasts for six of the last nine months, market analyst Marshall 
Gittler at BDSwiss said: "It's clear that something major has changed with the US labor market. Economists' 
forecasts are based on regression analysis of past relationships and are therefore unable to capture this new 
'something' and predict it accurately." 
But he said they seem to be "wising up", with this month the forecast for an increase of only 178k new jobs.  
"That would be pretty low - the lowest since January of last year. But maybe it's all the US can do when people 
don't want to work." 
As Gittler said, with the Fed already set on a tightening path, it would take a "bombshell" surprise in the figures - a 
fall in jobs and a rise in unemployment - to deflect the Fed from its intended course.  
"Any less and they'll stick with what they've determined. Of course a blowout figure that sent the unemployment rate 
down below its pre-pandemic level and a big increase in participation and they might have the courage to hike by 
50 bps at a time. That would be positive for the dollar."

 After Lynne Garell's husband died of cancer, she told friends she was moving to France for a year. She needed a 
new adventure, she told them. 
 She arrived in south-central France with a 12-month visa, a lease for an 800-euro-a month two-bedroom apartment 
in a village of 1,200 people, knowing no one.  
Four years later, she's still there and has decided to build an eco-friendly house. 
 'I love it here,' the 63-year-old said of an area she describes as the 'garden of France.' She's taking French classes 
twice a week to improve her already-good language skills, has been jokingly dubbed 'Madame le Fromage' by a 
local policewoman who was curious as to why an American had settled there (she joked that she loves cheese), 
and plans to apply for a 10-year visa in 2022. She blogs about her life in the Minervois region[1]. 
 Garell's connection to France goes back a long way. At 22, fresh out of college, she traveled around Europe, 
including France, got engaged to her husband while the two were on a DIY bike tour of the Dordogne region (during 
the cheese course, she says!) and made several more trips with her husband from their home in Steamboat 
Springs, Colo., even after his cancer diagnosis. 
 As she thought about where to live in France, she knew she wanted to head south for the sun and be in a place 
where she could walk the hills. She wanted to live neither in a city nor in Provence, which she described as 'a little 
bit like Disneyland.' 
 'I told everyone it would be a year. It gave me an out if I was miserable,' she recalled. 'The other thing is it was a 
stretch for my friends, but a bite they could understand.' 
 But before she could get a visa for that year, she needed a place to live. Looking online, she finally found a one-
year rental that appealed. It was in Bize-Minervois, a village of 1,200 people — that's less than one-tenth the size of 
Steamboat Springs.  
Where Should I Retire?: I told friends I was moving to France for a year. It's now 4 years later, and I'm building 
a house in this village of 1,200 people.
 The area, which attracts British, Dutch, German, Scandinavian and Australian expats, is just south of a 1,000-
square-mile regional nature park, about 45 minutes east of Carcassonne and about 25 miles from the 
Mediterranean. An airport less than an hour away features cheap Ryanair flights to London.  
 Winter highs average in the 50s, and summer highs tend to be in the mid-80s. 
 'You could easily live here on $2,500 to $3,000 a month' — much, much less than in Provence or Paris, she says. 
'It is absolutely costing me a lot less to live here than in Steamboat.' 
Meeting the locals 
Through a series of fortunate connections that began with a French friend who lives in Nice, she met a woman in 
Bize who has become her closest friend in town. 
 Newcomers also can join a club to make French friends. In Bize-Minervois, the town's social club organizes walks, 
the village choir, computer classes, arts groups and other activities, makes a float for the annual Carnival parade, 
and even raised money for local businesses badly hurt by flooding. 
 On the regular Tuesday afternoon walk with about 20 to 30 people, she's usually the only English speaker, she 
says. 
 'My closest French friends introduced me to the club,' she said. 'And through them I have met many other locals. I 
feel really lucky to have met these friends, because they've taken me under their wing in a big way. We go out on 
walks together. We explore other towns. I've traveled with them a few times. We share meals together. It's been a 
terrific blessing that has made a huge difference to my experience here.'

Another way to meet people, she said, is to join the comit des ftes, which organizes local festivals. In Bize-
Minervois, that include an olive-oil festival and the Sardinade, where people feast on sardines and wine. Or find a 
group that seeks to preserve French heritage, or patrimoine. It may spend its time clearing overgrowth or rebuilding 
a 300-year-old stone wall. 
 'If people really want to immerse and have a relationship with the locals, it's important to meet them on their turf 
and do things they like to do,' Garell observed. 
 And of course that doesn't exclude looking for an English-speaking club; she's a member of a regional one that has 
language classes, a wine-tasting group, cooking classes and more. 
 To find out about clubs in a smaller town, Garell recommends starting with the mayor's office. She never dealt with 
a mayor's office in the U.S. but discovered how helpful the one in Bize could be after an English friend suggested 
she go there to get some photocopies made and faxes sent. (Which the municipal office was willing to do for free.) 
Getting permission to live in France 
Americans can spend up to 90 out of 180 days[2] in France and the rest of the European Union and Schengen area 
with just a tourist visa stamped into their passport upon arrival. Anyone staying longer needs to apply for a visa 
before arriving. Among the many documents required by France are a French address as well as proof of health 
insurance and enough money to live on. But it's not unheard of to be told something is missing and to come back 
again. 
 When Garell went to the French consulate in Los Angeles with her documents, she quickly realized one thing: that 
none of the other applicants was greeting the interviewer with a cheery bonjour, standard practice in France. 
 She did — an icebreaker — and conducted most of the conversation in French. 
 Then there was another stroke of luck. 
 'Bize-Minervois?' she recalled the official asking. 'I vacationed there every year as a kid; my grandparents were 
there. You're going to love it.' 
 She left with her visa. 
 There was more to do once she arrived in France, including a tuberculosis test and a vetting of her language skills 
to see whether she needed free French classes. (She took a two-week intensive French class in France before 
deciding to move.) 
Where Should I Retire?: I told friends I was moving to France for a year. It's now 4 years later, and I'm building 
a house in this village of 1,200 people.

 Health insurance and a driver's license 
Garell arrived with travel insurance that offered limited coverage (though it did include repatriation in case of death) 
and cost $2,000 a year. Once she paid French taxes for the first time, she had standard, taxpayer-funded French 
health insurance and the accompanying carte vitale. She has supplemented it with a private policy that costs about 
800 euros, or just over $900, a year. 
 When she broke her toe in the fall of 2021, her only costs were 5 euros for an X-ray and 12 euros for a walking 
boot. 
 The driver's license was an easy one for Garell. Colorado is one of 13 states in the U.S. that have agreements with 
France to accept the other's license. Otherwise, it's expensive and challenging: You need to go to driving school 
and then pass a written test in French. 
 One of the hardest rules to grasp may be 'priorit  droite,' or when to yield to cars on the right. Those on the right 
have priority[3] — unless one of a range of signs is present indicating otherwise. 
 She's thinking about taking some driving lessons just to get that down pat.

BA boss vows to rebuild reputation for premium service Interview. Sean Doyle Effort to fend off low-cost rivals

British Airways chief Sean Doyle pledged yesterday to rebuild relations with customers and staff and restore the 
airline's reputation for premium service as the industry recovers from the pandemic.
Doyle, who spent the first 15 months in charge in near permanent crisis management, unveiled his strategy to 
emerge from the pandemic and aviation's worst crisis in an address to 30,000 staff via video link.
One of his priorities will be to restore the airline's brand as a premium offering, which will give passengers a better 
service than its no-frills rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet while keeping costs down.
"There is room for optimism that we are on the way out" of the pandemic, and the airline needed to "redefine" its 
place in the airline world, including a heavy emphasis on service and the passenger experience, said Doyle.
"Putting the premium proposition into the heart of what we do is going to be key," he said at BA's headquarters near 
Heathrow. "We want people to come off a British Airways flight and talk about it as if it's something different."
The strategy represents the Irish executive's first move to stamp his mark on BA and indicates he will not focus on 
wholesale changes.

and restore carrier as driver of IAG profits
Instead, he will prioritise rebuilding the airline's brand as a premium service in an effort to make it once again the 
main driver of profits for its Spanish parent International Airlines Group.
But it is a challenge successive BA bosses struggled to meet because of conflicting pressures of trying to compete 
with low-cost carriers in economy class while maintaining standards for business and first class passengers.
The challenge is arguably greater for
Doyle than his predecessors as BA emerges from a pandemic that culminated in lay-offs criticised as "a national 
disgrace" by MPs.
It was in effect the final act of a chaotic period during which the airline lurched through a cascade of problems, 
including
IT failures, a data breach and its first pilots' strike.
The boss of Qatar Airways, the largest shareholder of IAG, joined in the criticism last year when he hit at the airline 
in an FT interview.
Doyle took over as chief executive in
October 2020 from Alex Cruz, whose four-year tenure was marred by mishaps but included winning billions of 
pounds of much-needed investment from IAG to update a tired and increasingly uncompetitive business class 
product.
"It's to the credit of the business that it carried on with those investments over the course of the pandemic, because 
I think it realised in the long run that we needed to do that," said Doyle, who was chief executive of Aer Lingus 
before rejoining BA, where he learnt his trade during 20 years in senior roles.
Cruz took the heat for difficult decisions to reduce the airline's costs during the pandemic, including sacking a third 
of the workforce and retiring older and more inefficient jumbo jets.
Doyle said building strong relations with crew would be critical, and he would put staff "back into the heart" of the 
company.
One executive at a rival European airline noted that Doyle was in the fortunate position of taking over at a time 
when investments were coming through and the cost base had been reshaped. Doyle has added to that by 
launching a new subsidiary with lower costs at Gatwick airport.
"Sean wasn't hired to make fundamental changes," said another executive with knowledge of the IAG hiring 
process, noting that Doyle's vision to focus on service and a premium image was "a cost-effective way to stay 
relevant".
He will have to return the airline to its normal position as the main provider of profits at IAG. BA haemorrhaged 
(EURO)3.9bn in 2020, more than half of IAG's (EURO)7.4bn loss for the year.
"The profits are the oxygen for the business to do the things it wants to," Doyle said.
The key question that could define his tenure will be whether these light touches can help transform BA's image 
following years of turbulence.
"Any airline can go out and buy products off the shelf and put them on a plane. It's actually the confidence and the 
style and the intimacy that we deliver in service that is going to be a differentiator," he said.
