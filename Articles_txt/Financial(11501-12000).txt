Brazil has organised meetings with foreign airlines to try to persuade them to launch domestic flights there, Ronei 
Glanzmann, secretary for civil aviation at the country's Ministry of Infrastructure, told Reuters on the sidelines of the 
Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA) Airline Leaders Forum in Brasilia on October 27. 
"These are conversations to introduce Brazil to them, they do not mean that the airlines are saying that they will 
come here," he said. "We are working first with [getting them to operate] international routes, but we are already 
working so that those operations will become domestic operations in the Brazilian market."

Six months after Wow Air ceased operations, a new Icelandic carrier has officially emerged with plans to start 
operations soon.
Play, the new low-cost carrier, is headed by former Wow Air head of operations Arnar Magnusson. The company is 
in the final stages of obtaining an air operator's certificate and has reportedly received about $40 million of 
investment.
Play will use the same aircraft as Wow Air, the Airbus A321, to serve destinations across Europe and, later, in North 
America.
Wow Air operated seven A321s, two A321neos, two A320s and three A330-300s at the end of March 2019. It had 
released five A321s in the final quarter of 2018.
Play plans to start operations with two aircraft and aims to have a six-aircraft fleet next summer. The number will 
grow to 10 units within three years.
Airfinance Journal reported in July that two former executives of Wow Air were planning to resurrect the Icelandic 
carrier under the provisional name of WAB (We Are Back) Air.
Arnar Magnusson and Svein Steinporsson had plans to hold 25% of WAB through their company Neo, while 75% 
would be owned by Avianta Capital, an Irish investment fund owned by Aislinn Whittley-Ryan, part of the family that 
founded Ryanair.
Avianta was to commit ISK5 billion ($39.2m) for its stake, reported Icelandic business publication Marka&urinn, with 
$30 million of that funding to be sourced from Icelandic banks Arion Bank and Landsbankinn under one-year loans.

Ryanair profit flat in H1

Ryanair's net profit was flat in the first half of the year at (EURO)1.15 billion ($1.67 billion) as the carrier warned of a 
"rising" risk of further delays to the arrival of its Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
Revenues rose 11% to (EURO)5.39 billion from (EURO)4.84 billion.
Ticket sales rose 5% to (EURO)3.74 billion as the airline carried 11% more passengers, although yields fell 5% due 
to weak consumer demand in the UK and over-capacity in Germany and Austria.
Ancillary revenue rose 28% to (EURO)1.65 billion as more passengers chose add-ons such as the airline's priority 
boarding and preferred seat services.
Total costs rose 16% to (EURO)4.10 billion from (EURO)3.53 billion. Of this the fuel bill rose 22% to (EURO)1.59 
billion due to higher prices and 11% traffic growth.
Ex-fuel unit costs rose 2%, primarily due to higher staff costs, increased pilot pay and higher-than-expected crew 
ratios, higher maintenance costs (as older aircraft remain in the fleet due to the Boeing 737 Max delivery delays) 
and consolidation costs at Lauda.
The airline now predicts its first Max aircraft will be delivered in March or April 2020 at the earliest, but is wary of 
further delays. The carrier expects to have 20 Max aircraft by summer 2020 rather than the 58 previously forecast, 
leading to a cut in its expected growth rate from 7% to 3%.
Ryanair said that Austrian subsidiary Lauda has a pricing environment that remains "difficult" in its key Austrian and 
German markets, and that its revenue per guest remains "behind target". Cost reduction and improved ancillary 
spend is expected to "push it" towards breakeven in 2021.
At 30 September 70% of Ryanair's fleet was "debt free". After dividend payments, the carrier has (EURO)450 
million available to buy back shares from UK-based holders in the event of a "hard Brexit scenario".
Net debt stood at (EURO)460 million at the end of the period.
Ryanair profit flat in H1
Cash and cash equivalents stood at (EURO)2.12 billion by the end of September. They totalled (EURO)1.68 billion 
at the end of March. The airline has narrowed its full-year guidance to between (EURO)800 million and (EURO)900 
million of profit after tax.

Airlines overpaying for leased aircraft: Ryanair

Airlines are paying "over the odds" for leased aircraft as a result of a global shortage of available units in the 
secondary market, Ryanair Group chief executive Michael O'Leary believes.
Speaking on an analysts call on 4 November, O'Leary said that the global grounding of the Boeing 737 Max was 
exacerbating a global shortage in second-hand narrowbody aircraft.
As a result, lessors seeking to place former Thomas Cook aircraft with new customers are asking for six- or seven-
year commitments from airlines and demanding rents of (EURO)250,000 to (EURO)350,000 ($270,000 to 
$390,000) per month plus maintenance reserves, he said.
O'Leary said that Ryanair and its subsidiaries would only take second-hand aircraft if they were offered at a "cheap" 
price.
"I would never compromise our cost base in favour of short-term growth," he said.
Nevertheless, he said that there were opportunities for Ryanair subsidiary Lauda to secure new aircraft thanks to 
the collapse of Thomas Cook, with aircraft available at (EURO)180,000 per month and with no maintenance reserve 
demanded.
Lauda plans to grow its fleet from 23 Airbus A320s this summer to 38 next summer thanks to the recent failure of 
Thomas Cook Airlines and Adria Airways releasing aircraft and pilots into the market.
O'Leary said that Ryanair would be growing "gangbusters" if it was able to take delivery of the Boeing 737 Max 
aircraft it was due to receive before the global grounding of the type.
The airline is not expecting to take delivery of its first Max aircraft until March or April 2020. Now it plans to have 20 
in place for the summer season rather than the 58 it expected originally.
O'Leary said that if the carrier had been able to secure 50, 60 or 70 Max aircraft it could have expanded more 
quickly in 2020 rather than cutting its growth rate and closing bases.

Nov 01, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Reuters A Ryanair 
flight was told it was near the North Pole when it was actually over northern Spain. The Boeing 737-800 was flying 
from Portugal to Scotland in October 2018 when one of its instruments wildly misjudged the plane's position. A 
number of other errors, including with the plane's altitude readings, prompted the pilots to fly the plane manually, 
and it had an "uneventful" landing in Edinburgh. 
The plane was tested, but "no specific fault or failure could be identified or confirmed." Visit Business Insider's 
homepage for more stories[1]. A plane from Portugal to Scotland was mistakenly told it was was flying near the 
North Pole when its navigation equipment malfunctioned. The flight, Ryanair flight EI GJT, was flying over northern 
Spain with 177 passengers on board in October 2018 when the plane's Inertial Reference System malfunctioned, 
according to the UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch[2]. The system showed the pilots that they were near the 
North Pole. However, the pilots knew this wasn't true, and continued the flight by controlling the plane manually, the 
report said. A separate GPS system showed the correct position of the plane. The plane's altitude and windshear 
indicators also malfunctioned, according to the report, leading pilots to run through checklists and the plane's 
manuals. The AAIB said the aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, made a safe and "uneventful" landing in Edinburgh using 
manual breaking. The AAIB looked at the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder after the flight. Boeing 
tested the plane, and found "no significant faults or defects were found" after multiple tests. Ultimately, "no specific 
fault or failure could be identified or confirmed" and a simulator of the plane "was unable to replicate the fault that 
occurred in the aircraft." The plane had 1,705 flight hours before the flight.NOW WATCH: Why Tesla's Model 3

Nov 01, 2019( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Boeing is grounding up to 50 of its 
popular 737NG planes due to cracks. That is the second major blow to the US aviation manufacturer that was 
forced to ground the best-selling aircraft in its history, namely the Max 737. The NG is a precursor to 737 MAX, 
which was grounded since the two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Among the worst affected companies 
is Australia's Qantas, which grounded 32 aircraft, which reported cracks on nine of its planes in October. The 
Boeing 737NG is also part of Ryanair's fleet. A Boeing spokesperson on Thursday told AFP that less than 5% of 
1,000 planes had cracks, which were grounded for repair. Australia's Virgin Airways conducted checks on its fleet of 
17 Boeing 737NG finding no cracks. Initially, the US Federal Aviation Administration demanded the grounding for 
checks of all Boeing 737NG planes that hadflown more than 30,000 times.The call found the reaction of the US 
regulator 'completely irresponsible,' noting that a crack does not immediately compromise the safety of the aircraft.

Oct 31, 2019( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  I realize that's a headline only 
an accountant can love, but, well, it's a nice summary of the issue at hand. A change in strategy has been great for 
Norwegian, but it took the airline far too long to realize the rapid growth under founder and previous CEO Bjørn Kjos 
was doomed to fail. Third quarter results are in[1], and they aren't bad now that the strategy has changed. 
They aren't exactly great either, however. That's probably the nicest thing I've said about Norwegian's finances in a 
long time.The July-September quarter in Europe is the peak of the peak, and it better be a good quarter or else. 
This year, it was decent for Norwegian. If airlines like Ryanair and Wizz didn't exist with their stratospheric profit 
margins, Norwegian might look better. Pre-tax earnings were NOK 2.2 billion (~$240 million) on revenue of NOK 
14.4 billion (~$1.6 billion). But there were 'other gains' of NOK 249.9 million (~$27 million) which I removed. That 
gives the airline a third quarter margin of 13.6 percent. This may sound good, but when put into perspective versus 
previous years, it's only the third best in the last five years. Data via Norwegian Investor Relations reports[2] The 
indicators are all pointing in the right direction. Year-over-year yield was up 3 percent with load factor rising 0.7 
points to 91.2 percent. That led to a unit revenue increase of 3 percent despite the 3 percent increase in average 
sector length. (An increase in that usually brings unit revenue down.) This isn't as strong of a gain as we saw in the 
second quarter[3] year-over-year, but this is still good to see.How did Norwegian make this happen? It's simple. 
The airline implemented its new strategy to try to make a profit and stopped growing. Capacity was up only 3 
percent year-over-year. With the exception of 2015 when Norwegian took a breath, this is the most rational growth 
we've seen by this airline. And this is the kind of thing that helps improve revenues. Data via Norwegian Investor 
Relations reports[4]  Ok, so it's not really THAT simple. Norwegian faced strong headwinds in its home market 
where demand has dropped. In fact, in the third quarter, the US surpassed Norway as the number one source of 
revenue for the company. Take a look at this chart. You can see the biggest drops in revenue percentage came 
from Nordic countries (can you say 'flight-shaming'?) along with the UK. Chart via Norwegian 3Q2019 Report[5] It 
also had a unit revenue tailwind here in that it has 18 737 MAX aircraft on the ground with more deliveries being 
delayed. That's one reason beyond even the new strategy that growth was so anemic. This only helps push up 
fares, though according to Norwegian it's a net negative. The airline says for the full year, it will take a NOK 1 billion 
(~$109 million) hit to profits because of the grounding.On the cost side, the news was also quite good. Excluding 
fuel, unit costs dropped a whopping 6 percent. Most staggering is an incredible reduction of 30 percent in 
Norwegian Sees Income Improvement, But The Balance Sheet Problem Looms
maintenance costs over last year. When I see a number like that, I naturally assume that it's due to maintenance 
timing or some other fluke, but Norwegian says it was due to 'cost reductions related to renegotiated contracts.' 
That is some serious negotiation.So what does all this mean? Is Norwegian in great shape now? No, of course not. 
Year-to-date, Norwegian is still in negative territory. Its pre-tax margin excluding other gains is -2.1 percent. And the 
fourth quarter isn't great for anyone in Europe. The airline spent so many years burning furniture to stay afloat that 
its balance sheet is weak. European leisure airline life is like that of a bear. They need to get fat and happy during 
the summer so they can survive through the winter. This result isn't good enough to make that happen without help. 
And with each year that passes, it gets tougher and tougher to survive.That's why Norwegian had to beg its 
bondholders to restructure this year. The airline had $380 million in bonds coming due, and it asked bondholders to 
defer for two years[6] so it could save cash. In exchange, it would pay a premium on the bond, and it would pledge 
its London/Gatwick slots as collateral. The deal is done, but it means Norwegian now has one less thing it can burn 
next time it needs help. Its debt costs also got became more expensive.At this point, it's really a race against time. 
There is a sustainable business somewhere at Norwegian, but it is burdened by years of bad strategy decisions. 
Will the airline be able to make it before it runs out of cash during a dark and dreary winter? This is annual game 
that 
we'll 
continue 
to 
play 
for 
the 
foreseeable 
future.

London BP led the FTSE 100 fallers as hopes of a dividend rise were dashed. Quarterly earnings beat forecasts, 
albeit thanks to its Rosneft partnership and a lower than guided tax rate, but the company's guidance on debt 
remaining above target levels into next year appeared to scotch the chances of improved shareholder returns within 
the next six months.
Royal Bank of Scotland retreated after UBS took the lender off its "buy" list. The current premium of between 30 per 
cent and 40 per cent to Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group looked reasonable given RBS's higher gearing to UK 
interest rates and its excess capital, though the need to restructure NatWest Markets meant investors might need to 
be patient for cash returns, UBS said.
Royal Mail dropped after JPMorgan Cazenove advised selling ahead of a potential postal worker strike next month. 
"While the direct cost of a strike is potentially manageable, we believe the indirect costs of lower parcel volume and 
cost savings are likely material," it said.
Ryanair gained on Goodbody "buy" advice. Airline share prices had been driven by Brexit rather than improving 
trends that would become apparent during results season, the broker said. Bryce Elder

BP led the FTSE 100 fallers as hopes of a dividend rise were dashed. Quarterly earnings beat forecasts, albeit 
thanks to its Rosneft partnership and a lower than guided tax rate, but the company's guidance on debt remaining 
above target levels into next year appeared to scotch the chances of improved shareholder returns within the next 
six months.
Royal Bank of Scotland retreated after UBS took the lender off its "buy" list. The current premium of between 30 per 
cent and 40 per cent to Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group looked reasonable given RBS's higher gearing to UK 
interest rates and its excess capital, though the need to restructure NatWest Markets meant investors might need to 
be patient for cash returns, UBS said.
Royal Mail dropped after JPMorgan Cazenove advised selling ahead of a potential postal worker strike next month. 
"While the direct cost of a strike is potentially manageable, we believe the indirect costs of lower parcel volume and 
cost savings are likely material," it said.
Ryanair gained on Goodbody "buy" advice. Airline share prices had been driven by Brexit rather than improving 
trends that would become apparent during results season, the broker said. Bryce Elder

September’s collapse of Thomas Cook Group in the UK provides a further competitive shift in the crowded dynamic 
on key European leisure markets.
Cirium schedules data shows that Thomas Cook Airlines operated from 10 UK airports in August 2019.
Rex Shutterstock
Roughly a third of its flights – and more than a third of its seat capacity – was focused on just over 50 routes out of 
Manchester at last summer's peak.
Over a fifth of its capacity was deployed from London Gatwick, while Birmingham was the next-biggest UK point in 
the Thomas Cook network – representing around 10% of its August capacity from the UK.
While Spain was the airline's biggest market – in terms of both number of routes and flight capacity from the UK – it 
is perhaps in the UK-Turkey holiday market that its presence will be most missed. The airline operated thicker 
frequencies in the UK-Turkish market, flying almost the same number of seats to Turkey as Spain in August 2019, 
despite operating fewer than half the routes.
Thomas Cook was only the fourth-biggest operator in terms of capacity on UK-Spain routes in August 2019 – well 
behind Ryanair, EasyJet and Jet2 – but was the biggest operator from the UK to Turkey for the same month.
Ten of Thomas Cook's 20 biggest routes by seat capacity last August were to Turkey, with Dalaman and Antalya 
featuring prominently.
COMPETITORS MOVE TO FILL THOMAS COOK VOID
ANALYSIS: Which markets has the fall of Thomas Cook impacted; September’s collapse of Thomas Cook 
Group in the UK provides a further competitive shift in the cr....
Little surprise, then, that some of the expansion moves by rival leisure carriers are aimed squarely at these 
markets.
On 17 October, UK operator Jet2 announced plans to lift its seat capacity at Manchester next summer by 16% 
through the addition of 450,000 more seats.
Notably 140,000 of those seats are on Turkish routes including Dalaman and Antalya.
At Birmingham, Jet2 is lifting seat capacity 23% next summer, with the addition of 160,000 seats. A quarter of these 
additional seats are focused on Turkey.
Manchester and Birmingham also feature prominently in TUI Airways' expansion from the UK next summer, part of 
the 2 million additional seats it announced it was adding to the market following the collapse of Thomas Cook.
"Like any good business would, we need to make sure we fill some of that void that has been left for customers that 
would have traditionally gone on Thomas Cook," TUI Airways managing director Dawn Wilson, who heads up the 
UK airline, told FlightGlobal during the Airlines 2050 conference in London on 17 October.
"We intend to grow our business and we think there are some good opportunities out there. We saw initially when 
[Thomas Cook] first went into receivership, we had a lot of customers reaching out to us to book holidays straight 
away. So our announcement is very much focused in the regions. We like to take local people on holiday from local 
airports."
WHAT DOES MONARCH PRECEDENT SHOW?
Thomas Cook's collapse came two years after another long-established name in the UK leisure business, Monarch 
Airlines, had suffered a similar fate. Monarch, which like Thomas Cook had been battling legacy financial issues, 
found itself squeezed on UK leisure routes to Spain, Portugal and Greece after it was forced to shift capacity from 
the then-troubled holiday markets in Turkey and North Africa.
Notably, Monarch found itself among multiple players operating on key leisure routes. In many cases it was 
competing with its charter rivals TUI, Jet2 and Thomas Cook as well as the low-cost operators.
For example, Monarch and Thomas Cook were among seven carriers flying between Manchester and Palma de 
Mallorca in August 2017. These seven carriers flew 321 return services on the route across the month. Monarch 
accounted for 48 of these, but the capacity was swiftly picked up by rivals. By August 2019, Cirium schedules data 
shows, there were 337 return flights between Manchester and Palma de Mallorca – some 16 more than when 
Monarch had been flying.
Thomas Cook was a relatively small player on the route and the loss of its daily service is unlikely to change the 
dynamic of competition very much. History would suggest this capacity may easily be absorbed by its rivals.
However, overall capacity between the UK and Spain remains down in the peak summer months, Cirium schedules 
data shows. UK leisure carrier Jet2 has added the most capacity since August 2017, one of five alongside British 
Airways, EasyJet, Iberia Express and Ryanair to do so. But seat capacity between the UK and Spain is 5% down in 
August 2019. While this largely reflects the lost capacity of Monarch, both TUI Airways and Thomas Cook have cut 
their UK-Spain capacity at a double-digit rate since August 2017.
TRAVEL FIRMS TURN TO TURKEY
Turkey was one of the markets to which both Thomas Cook Airlines and TUI Airways transferred capacity from the 
UK. That coincided with the wider recovery in the Turkish tourism market. Overall seat capacity from the UK to 
Turkey was running more than 50% higher in August this year than the same month two years previously. Seat 
capacity in the UK-Turkish market is now at its highest level, Cirium capacity figures for the year ending October 
show.
ANALYSIS: Which markets has the fall of Thomas Cook impacted; September’s collapse of Thomas Cook 
Group in the UK provides a further competitive shift in the cr....
Thomas Cook Airlines had been a key player in that increase. It lifted its own seat capacity by 48% compared with 
August 2018, at a faster rate than the next-biggest operator Turkish Airlines. As a result, it was the biggest operator, 
accounting for around 36% of seat capacity, in the UK-Turkish market immediately prior to its collapse.
That capacity focused on just four Turkish destinations: Bodrum, Izmir, Antalya and Dalaman.
As many of Thomas Cook's challenges were related to business model and legacy financial issues, rather than the 
market specifically, it is little surprise to see rival travel firms picking up this capacity. Even before their recent 
expansion announcements, Jet2 had added Turkish capacity at a faster rate than Thomas Cook in absolute terms 
since August 2017. And TUI Airways was not far behind Thomas Cook in its volume of added seats.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AT GATWICK
While expansion moves have already been announced by rivals at Birmingham and Manchester, future 
developments at the slot-constrained Gatwick will hinge on the resolution of Thomas Cook's insolvency process.
In recent years, slots at Gatwick have become increasingly prized, and those of Monarch were sharply contested.
British Airways parent IAG bid successfully for the slots after Monarch's administrator, KPMG, successfully 
overturned a court ruling to enable it to so sell the slots as part of efforts to raise funds.
KPMG is one of the administrators handling the Thomas Cook insolvency and reportedly set a mid-October 
deadline for bids for the slots. Reports suggest IAG and Wizz Air are among the bidders.
Back in February when Thomas Cook Group began evaluating the possible sale of of its airline units as part of 
fund-raising efforts, chief executive Peter Fankhauser had flagged its "great" slots at airports including Gatwick and 
Manchester.
LONG-HAUL FEELS AN IMPACT
Thomas Cook also operated a number long-haul routes to popular leisure destinations in the USA, Mexico and 
Caribbean.
Of its US routes from the UK, most of these focused on Orlando, with a number other destinations served from 
Manchester.
Notably, its greatest long-haul capacity in August 2019 was on Manchester routes to New York JFK and Orlando, 
and the Mexican resort of Cancun. It operated at least daily flights on all three routes.
The demise of Thomas Cook leaves TUI Airways as currently the only operator on Manchester-Cancun, and Virgin 
Atlantic as the only scheduled operator serving New York JFK and Orlando from the UK airport.
From Gatwick, Thomas Cook was, in August, the smallest of four operators serving Orlando. British Airways, 
Norwegian and Virgin Atlantic all operated at least daily services on Orlando-Gatwick during August 2019.

Thomas Cook's collapse came two years after another long-established name in the UK leisure business, Monarch 
Airlines, had suffered a similar fate. Monarch, which like Thomas Cook had been battling legacy financial issues, 
found itself squeezed on UK leisure routes to Spain, Portugal and Greece after it was forced to shift capacity from 
the then-troubled holiday markets in Turkey and North Africa.
Notably Monarch found itself among multiple players operating on key leisure routes. In many cases it was 
competing with its charter rivals TUI, Jet2 and Thomas Cook as well as the low-cost operators.
For example, Monarch and Thomas Cook were among seven carriers flying between Manchester and Palma de 
Mallorca in August 2017. These seven carriers flew 321 return services on the route across the month. Monarch 
accounted for 48 of these, but the capacity was swiftly picked up by rivals. By August 2019, Cirium schedules data 
shows there were 337 return flights between Manchester and Palma de Mallorca - some 16 more than when 
Monarch had been flying.
Thomas Cook was a relatively small player on the route and the loss of its daily service is unlikely to change the 
dynamic of competition very much. History would suggest this capacity may easily be absorbed by its rivals.
Overall capacity, however, between the UK and Spain remains down in the peak summer months, Cirium 
schedules data show. UK leisure carrier Jet2 has added the most capacity since August 2017, one of five alongside 
British Airways, EasyJet, Iberia Express and Ryanair to do so. But seat capacity between the UK and Spain is 5% 
down in August 2019. While this largely reflects the lost capacity of Monarch, both TUI Airways and Thomas Cook 
have cut their UK-Spain capacity at a double-digit rate since August 2017.
TRAVEL FIRMS TURN TO TURKEY
Turkey was one of the markets to which both Thomas Cook Airlines and TUI Airways transferred capacity from the 
UK. That coincided with the wider recovery in the Turkish tourism market. Overall seat capacity from the UK to 
Turkey was running more than 50% higher in August this year than the same month two years previously. Seat 
capacity in the UK-Turkish market is now at its highest level, Cirium capacity figures for the year ending October 
show.
ANALYSIS: Which markets has Thomas Cook fall impacted; September’s collapse of Thomas Cook Group in 
the UK provides a further competitive shift in the crowded d....
Thomas Cook Airlines had been a key player in that increase. It lifted its own seat capacity by 48% compared with 
August 2018, at a faster rate than the next biggest operator Turkish Airlines. As a result, it was the biggest operator, 
accounting for around 36% of seat capacity, in the UK-Turkish market immediately prior to its collapse.
That capacity focused on just four Turkish destinations: Bodrum, Izmir, Antalya and Dalaman.
As much of Thomas Cook's challenges were related to business model and legacy financial issues, rather than the 
market specifically, it is little surprise to see rival travel firms picking up this capacity. Even before their recent 
expansion announcements, Jet2 had added Turkish capacity at a faster rate than Thomas Cook in absolute terms 
since August 2017. And TUI Airways was not far behind Thomas Cook in its volume of added seats.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AT GATWICK
While expansion moves have already been announced by rivals at Birmingham and Manchester, future 
developments at the slot-constrained Gatwick will hinge on the resolution of Thomas Cook's insolvency process.
In recent years slots at Gatwick have become increasingly prized and those of Monarch were sharply contested.
British Airways parent IAG bid successfully for the slots after Monarch's administrator, KPMG, successfully 
overturned a court ruling to enable it to so sell the slots as part of efforts to raise funds.
KPMG is one of the administrators handling the Thomas Cook insolvency and reportedly set a mid-October 
deadline for bids for the slots. Reports suggest IAG and Wizz Air are among the bidders.
Back in February when Thomas Cook Group began evaluating the possible sale of of its airline units as part of 
fund-raising efforts, chief executive Peter Fankhauser had flagged its "great" slots at airports including Gatwick and 
Manchester.
LONG-HAUL FEELS AN IMPACT
Thomas Cook also operated a number long-haul routes to popular leisure destinations in the USA, Mexico and 
Caribbean.
Of its US routes from the UK, most of these focused on Orlando, with a number other destinations served from 
Manchester.
Notably its greatest long-haul capacity in August 2019 was on Manchester routes to New York JFK and Orlando, 
and the Mexican resort of Cancun. It operated at least daily flights on all three routes.
The demise of Thomas Cook leaves TUI Airways as currently the only operator on Manchester-Cancun, and Virgin 
Atlantic as the only scheduled operator serving New York JFK and Orlando from the UK airport.
From Gatwick, Thomas Cook was, in August, the smallest of four operators serving Orlando. British Airways, 
Norwegian and Virgin Atlantic all operated at least daily services on Orlando-Gatwick during August 2019.

Low 
cost 
airline 
Lauda 
has 
announced it is to start a direct service beween Vienna and Shannon Airport in 2020. The airline, owned by 
Ryanair, will commence the route in March 2020 and will operate it twice weekly as a summer service on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
Prices will begin as low as €33.99 one day. This is the second Ireland service announced by Lauda this month, with 
a new route between Knock Airport and Palma de Mallorca also scheduled to begin next March. The new route will 
be very welcome at Shannon Airport, which has lost over 120,000 seats this year due to the grounding of the 
Boeing 737 Max plane and the subsequent scaling back of services by Norwegian and Air Canada. The route was 
secured with the help of measures in Budget 2020 to fund regional airport development. 'This is very positive news 
for Shannon as not alone do we get a scheduled service to one of Europe's most visited cities and a strong inbound 
market for tourists to Ireland, but we are also getting a new carrier on the runway here as well. We have been 
working closely with Lauda and their parent Ryanair, to deliver this service and are looking forward to the airline 
commencing operation in the New Year,' said Andrew Murphy, Managing Director, Shannon Airport. Tourism 
Ireland has welcomed the news. Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: 'Today's announcement is good news 
for tourism to the west coast of Ireland - expanding the options for Austrian holidaymakers to come and experience 
the spectacular Wild Atlantic Way. We look forward to co-operating with Lauda, Shannon Airport and other tourism 
partners, to maximise the promotion of inbound travel on this new service.' Lauda currently operates a fleet of 22 
Airbus A320 aircraft.

Ryanair has selected Jordanian MRO provider Joramco to complete heavy checks on its Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Joramco says Ryanair has booked two parallel maintenance lines for the work, scheduled to begin in November 
through to the end of March 2020.
The deal represents the first collaboration between Ryanair and Amman-based Joramco.
Ryanair performs a majority of heavy checks at in-house facilities in Glasgow, Lithuanian city Kaunas and Wroclaw 
in Poland, the airline says in its 2019 annual report.
That network of facilities provides sufficient capacity to complete routine maintenance checks for the group's 737-
800 and Airbus A320 fleet, the carrier notes.
However, it adds that it subcontracts seasonal checks to third-party MRO providers and "expects to be dependent 
on external service contractors for A320 and 737 heavy maintenance for the foreseeable future".
Joramco chief executive Jeff Wilkinson sees the Ryanair deal as "the beginning" of a partnership with the low-cost 
carrier.
"We look forward to a long-term relationship," he states.
The MRO provider will "set new standards of excellence in line with the Ryanair's expectations", vows Wilkinson.
Separately, Joramco has disclosed a contract with Turkish cargo carrier MNG Airlines to complete C-checks on 
three A300s and one A330 between December and February.
MNG has been a Joramco customer since 2012.

It will then develop services from Gyumri to Memmingen, near Munich, in summer 2020, and expand from Yerevan 
to Berlin Schonefeld.
The airline uses a fleet of Boeing 737-800s.
Ryanair describes Armenia as "one of Europe's fastest-growing tourism destinations". All the new routes will be 
served twice-weekly, the carrier adds.

Capacity growth for the full 2020 financial year is expected to be at the lower end of easyJet's historic range 
Investors in airlines are often sensitive to any perceived difficulty in passenger numbers not keeping up with 
increases in capacity.
This could be behind the significant slide in easyJet's share price following a preliminary trading update for the year 
to September.
While the number of passengers carried increased by 8.6 per cent to 96m, this did not keep pace with a 10.3 per 
cent increase in capacity to 105m seats available, leading to a 1.4 percentage point decline in load factor to 91.5 
per cent.
Strikes at British Airways and Ryanair benefited easyJet in its second half. This, along with self-help initiatives" to 
drive assenger yield, mean that eadline pre-tax profit is expected to be between £420m and £430m, towards the 
upper end of previous guidance.
Total revenue per seat at constant currency for the second half is expected to increase by about 0.8 per cent, better 
than management's previous assessment that it would be "slightly down", due in part to the strike action disruption 
at competitors.
The increase in capacity also contributed to an increase in total headline cost for the full year, expected to be up 
around 12 per cent, with higher fuel costs at about £1.42bn and adverse foreign exchange movements also 
impacting on that figure.
EasyJet ( EZJ )
Excluding fuel, cost per seat at constant currency is expected to fall by around 0.8 per cent, despite the impact of 
storms and technical issues at Gatwick airport. Julia Faurschou

Oct 10, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Spirit Airlines 
flight's take-off was delayed after a passenger vomited in a co-traveler's hair. The incident took place aboard a flight 
from Chicago to Baltimore, Maryland, on Wednesday morning.Speaking to ABC7 Eyewitness News[1], an 
unidentifiedpassenger said the passenger who threw up was drunk and was removed the flight. 
The other passengers too were deplaned. The crew then cleaned the aircraft following which the flight took-
off.Meanwhile, the woman on whom the passenger had vomited was forced to wash her hair in a sink. A video 
shared by the unrelated passenger showed a flight attendant helping the woman clean the vomit out of her hair. 
Another video showed the passengers being deplaned.However, troubles were not over yet. Minutes after take-off, 
two drunk passengers locked themselves in the bathroom, causing another delay.The incident comes a few months 
after some Ryanair passengers [2]were filmed shouting and vomiting on a flight from Manchester to Croatia. The 
passengers, who were a group of party-goers, stormed into the flight and refused to listen to the crew when asked 
not to yell. A video of the incident showed the passengers yelling before one of them vomits and passes out amid 
laughter from his mates.Calling the situation as that of "a nightclub without the music,' a co-passenger said, "It was 
like being in a jungle with wild animals. It was hell on earth. It was the worst flight of my life. It was absolutely 
appalling. The only way I can describe it is like being in a nightclub without the music 10,000ft above the ground. 
They were shouting, chanting and the crew could not calm them down. They were uncontrollable. No one could 
calm them down. It was completely unacceptable. All of them were drunk.' A Spirit Airlines plane is parked on the 
tarmac as another Spirit Airlines passenger aircraft taxis after landing at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport,

Have you heard about Europe's new low-cost airline, Air Schadenfreude? Its flights board at departure gates right 
next to stranded British Airways passengers. Its baggage is always first on the carousel, ahead of Ryanair's 
surcharged suitcases. And its pilots will fly you to your destination and home again, unlike Thomas Cook's. Sound 
appealing? If anything, it sounds like easyJet, in its full-year trading update.
Johan Lundgren, boss of the real-life no-frills carrier, certainly took some pleasure from the misfortune of others - as 
"increased demand due to strikes at BA and Ryanair" let him increase his pre-tax profit forecast to "between £420m 
and £430m ... the upper half of our previous guidance range".
EasyJet passengers will also have taken pleasure from taking off when others couldn't, as investments in 
"operational resilience" - ie, crew rosters and standby aircraft - meant fewer cancellations since last September, 
while BA and Ryanair were leaving 235,000 people grounded.
But easyJet investors took nothing but a little pain - as a sell-off took the share price down 7.5 per cent.
Why would they have qualms over profiting at BA's and Ryanair's expense? EasyJet arguably deserved credit, and 
a slightly higher valuation, for keeping its staff onside, and in the right airports at the right time. It had them selling 
more ancillary services, too, which meant total revenue per seat rose 0.8 per cent in the second half, contrary to 
earlier guidance that it would be "slightly down". No, it wasn't the ability to profit from competitors' woes that 
investors felt uncomfortable with, just the amount of that profit.
EasyJet takes profit and pleasure from British Airways ' misfortune UK COMPANIES
Analysts at Bernstein questioned how profitable easyJet would have been without the strikes at BA and Ryanair. 
"We wonder what the influence of each of these factors, and the Thomas Cook bankruptcy, was ... the most 
interesting question to us is how much of this is due to disruption at competitors - and what the number would have 
been adjusted for underlying one-offs." In other words, how much less pleasure might easyJet have taken without 
others' misfortune? If the European airline sector is more swings and roundabouts than baggage carousels - with 
airlines taking turns to cash in on each other's disruption - then "it really amounts to a zero-sum game," argued 
analysts at AJ Bell. With plenty of investors able to play that game, easyJet's higher profit could easily have been 
anticipated. Hence the 36 per cent rise in its share price since the first BA strike was mooted, and the 7.5 per cent 
fall when there was little more positive news.
If easyJet's shares are to keep rising, and return to the FTSE 100 index, the company needs to achieve more 
progress on its own, on rising costs and slowing capacity growth. Only then will its market value rise from today's 
£4.3bn to the £4.5bn needed to overtake companies at the bottom end of the index. Its real profit will come at the 
expense of FTSE laggards Kingfisher, Centrica and J Sainsbury, not BA and Ryanair.

EASYJET yesterday predicted it would hit upper profit guidance of up to £430m for its full year, despite rising costs.
In a trading update, the airline said pre-tax profit would be between £420m and £430m, just off its £440m upper 
range prediction.
However, it warned of a 12 per cent rise in costs owing to a volatile pound and higher fuel prices.
Passenger numbers rose 8.6 per cent to 96m year on year thanks to a 10 per cent jump in capacity.
But revenue per seat is set for a 2.7 per cent drop due to a forex hit of £14m, despite increased demand after 
strikes by British Airways and Ryanair.
Easyjet shares slipped 4.5 per cent to 1,120p on the update and closed 7.55 per cent lower, even as analysts called 
the numbers "robust".
"Our implementation of initiatives in the fourth quarter to optimise yield has led to solid revenue performance with 
total revenue per seat at constant currency set to increase for the full year," Easyjet chief executive Johan 
Lundgren said.
CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson pointed to the 91.5 per cent load factor as a signal that 
capacity is worrying investors. "While this might improve by the end of the year it is evident that the industry still has 
too many seats," he said.

EasyJet said full-year profits would be at the top end of its forecasts, after a boost from pilot strikes at rivals British 
Airways and Ryanair.
The budget airline reported yesterday that it expected to deliver a profit before tax of between £420m and £430m 
for the 12 months ending September 30. In July, it had given a range of £400m to £440m.
The update comes almost a month after BA was hit by a two-day pilot walkout that grounded 2,325 flights.
International Airlines Group, which owns BA, warned that its full-year profits would be affected, saying the total 
financial impact of the strikes would be about (EURO)137m.
Ryanair has also seen strikes by pilots in the UK and Spain, although its flights were largely unaffected by the 
walkouts.
"EasyJet has continued to perform in line with expectations, despite challenging market conditions," said Johan

EasyJet is expecting a full-year headline pre-tax profit of £420-430 million ($516-528 million), down on the previous 
level of £578 million.
This figure is towards the upper end of its £400-440 million estimate, disclosed in July.
The UK budget airline's chief, Johan Lundgren, says market conditions have been "challenging" but that the carrier 
has performed "in line with expectations".
EasyJet benefited slightly from strike effects at British Airways and budget rival Ryanair, although it suffered its own 
disruption during the fourth quarter, which it attributes to technical problems at London Gatwick as well as weather 
impact in Europe.
"[Our] operational resilience initiative was a key driving force behind the strong performance," says the carrier.
Revenue per seat for the full year will fall by 2.7%, at constant currency, although the airline points out that the 
figure should rise for the second half – contrary to previous expectations.
Headline cost per seat, excluding fuel, at constant currency will fall by around 0.8%. But the airline predicts a total 
fuel cost of £1.42 billion for the year.
EasyJet's first quarter bookings for 2019-20 are "in line" with levels recorded a year ago, and it expects capacity 
during the new fiscal year to be "at the lower end of our historic range".

 British airline easyJet (EZJ.L) said in a premarket filing Tuesday that it expects fiscal full-year headline pre-tax 
profit of between 420 million pound ($516.4 million) and 430 million pounds. 
The company previously said it expects pretax profit for the year ending Sept. 30 to be in the 400 million pounds to 
440 million pounds range. 
Both current and past estimates are lower than the 578 million headline profit before tax recorded in fiscal 2018. 
In its trading update, easyJet also said it expects total revenue per seat at constant currency for the reporting year 
to decline by 2.7%, total headline costs to jump 12% due to increased capacity, higher unit fuel costs and foreign 
exchange losses.
CEO Johan Lundgren said the company benefited from "disruption at British Airways and Ryanair," in the reporting 
period, despite challenging market conditions.   
Shares of the low-cost airline were up 3% at Monday's close.

Oct 08, 2019( Proactive Investors: http://www.proactiveinvestors.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing Company 
(NYSE:BA) saw its shares flewlower Tuesday after the company's ongoing process to get its beleaguered 737 MAX 
jets back in the air reportedly hit another snag. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that disputes over how 
the MAX's dual flight-control computers will work together may prolong the vetting process, citing people familiar 
with the details. 
Shares of Boeing fell 1.8% to $369.77 in midday trading. The idea of the dual flight-control computer is to keep 
planes in the air even in the event of a chip malfunction. The disagreements could mean a lack of support from 
European regulators even after the Federal Aviation Administration gives Boeing the green light, the people said. 
READ:Ryanair boss spares no one in slam on Thomas Cook's business model, aviation authority and carbon 
emissions The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reportedly told US regulators that it did not believe 
Boeing and the FAA had sufficiently demonstrated the safety of the computers, according to people briefed on the 
discussions, the paper added. Boeing is currently finishing tests of the computer system, the source said, and final 
results haven't yet been reported to the EASA. This could mean the European organization issues a different ruling 
than its US counterpart. The ambiguity has Boeing officials frustrated, the WSJ reported, because they remain 
unsure of what objections from EASA could further delay the process. 'We are very confident in that software 
solution, and we are now just marching through the final steps on certifying that, so that everybody's confident in 
the safety of the airplane,' CEO Dennis Mullenberg was reported as saying at a public appearance in New York last 
week. Any delay could make a huge difference, the Seattle Times has reported, as Boeing is reportedly considering 
cutting production at or temporarily shutting down its factory in Renton, Washington. For now, newly-produced MAX 
planes are heading into storage instead of in to the friendly skies. Separately, the company announced a $20 
million investment Tuesday into Virgin Galactic, the commercial spaceflight company founded by Richard Branson. 
In return, Boeing will receive new shares in Virgin Galactic, which plans to go public this year by way of a business 
combination with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp (IPOA). "Boeing's strategic investment facilitates our 
effort to drive the commercialization of space and broaden consumer access to safe, efficient, and environmentally 
responsible new forms of transportation," said Brian Schettler, senior managing director of Boeing HorizonX 
Ventures. HorizenX, which made the $20 million investment, serves as Boeing's venture capital arm. Contact

Vienna International airport has seen a boom in low-cost carriers after the collapse of Air Berlin and its local unit 
Niki in 2017, but its chief operating officer expects that some form of consolidation will occur soon.
The Austrian capital has become a hotbed of LCC competition, with the emergence of Ryanair's Lauda and IAG's 
Level. Wizz Air, meanwhile, has signalled that it intends to grow its Vienna base to15-20 aircraft within the next five 
years.
The airport's chief operating officer Julian Jager says that after the loss of Air Berlin, "a lot of low cost carriers 
discovered Vienna as a potential market and they are fighting now for the number two position" next to Austrian 
Airlines.
But he expects that there will be some rationalisation in the boom of low-cost capacity in the near-term.
"I would not be surprised if we see a certain consolidation – maybe next year, maybe the year after. I think that's 
normal with growth like that," he says.
As is, the situation appears unsustainable with the newer players discounting fares to build up their market share.
"We are seeing right now ticket price levels which are not sustainable," observes Jager. "I think it's obvious now that 
everyone went into the market, they have to position themselves and gain market share, but it is not sustainable in 
the long run. That is why there will be, one way or the other, consolidation and this does not bother us."
While the low-cost boom has helped to deliver passenger growth, Vienna has also benefited from the expansion of 
Austrian and the wider Lufthansa Group, as well as strong inbound tourism from Asia.
Vienna airport expects LCC consolidation Vienna International airport has seen a boom in low-cost carriers 
after the collapse of Air Berlin and its local unit N....
"Overall I think this is a reflection that Vienna is becoming a more and more attractive market. I think it is an 
attractive incoming tourism market, and at the same time the Austrian economy is doing well, and therefore it is a 
strong outgoing market as well," says Jager.

federal legislation (a copy of which is attached[2]) requires advertised room rates to include all 'required' fees (other 
than taxes). Violations of the Act are deemed to constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices under the FTC Act

Just weeks after publishing a paper challenging the legitimacy of thousands of TripAdvisor's reviews, Which? 
released a report this past week alleging that Booking.com has failed to meet the UK's Competition and Markets 
Authority's (CMA) September 1st deadline for cleaning up its online sales and marketing practices. According to the 
report, the Booking.com website made repeated representations of limited room availability (e.g., 'only 1 room 
remaining'), when in fact the online travel agent had over 30 rooms available at the same hotel. The CMA reports 
that it has already raised the issue with Booking.com and anticipates prompt corrective action. Whack-a-Mole

Oct 07, 2019( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Airline bankruptcies have created a 
fleet of second-hand aircraft, presenting airlines with a cost-effective opportunity to expand their capacity and lower 
maintenance costs. 2019 appears to be the biggest bankruptcy year for the aviation industry in history. The collapse 
of India's SpiceJet Airways, UK travel group Thomas Cook, Avianca of Brazil, Germania, Flybmi, Slovenia's Adria, 
France's XL and Aigle Azur, means hundreds of planes are up for liquidation. As the entire global fleet of Boeing's 
Max fleet remains grounded and the dollar surges - putting upward pressure on the price of fuel - more companies 
could fall under. Profit margins are squeezed, while stronger carriers move in to snap planes, airport slots, and 
market share from their collapsed rivals. Last week Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith hailed the process of market 
consolidation through bankruptcies as a process that would eventually benefit the French aviation. Air France 
withdrew a rescue bid for Aigle Azur and XL Airways. For its part, Ryanair that has been hit hard by the MAX 
grounding and is looking to acquire the Airbus A320 previously owned by Thomas Cook. Others could follow.

British-based budget carrier Ryanair is playing catch-up today after a "major systems failure" grounded planes 
across Europe on Saturday-some for up to 12 hours.
Hundreds of passengers were prevented from checking in for their flights and could not download boarding passes 
on their smartphones.
Others said their boarding passes completely disappeared from their smartphones, and they were forced to pay to 
check in at the airport-55 euros or just over $61 USD.

The bell has rung on the latest round in the battle between the world's aviation heavyweights, Boeing and Airbus. 
This time a long-running phoney war threatens to turn into real hostilities. Under a ruling issued yesterday, 
arbitrators at the World Trade Organization gave the US the green light to levy tariffs on European goods worth up 
to almost $7.5bn per year - the largest amount ever authorised.
Europe and the US have been fighting over subsidies for their respective aircraft makers for more than a decade, 
long before President Donald Trump's feud with China and his "America first" strategy made such trade battles 
fashionable. Mr Trump has described the EU as "worse than China, just smaller". He has already threatened to 
impose tariffs on imported cars as a stick to persuade Europe to include agriculture in any trade talks. Much as he 
might relish the fight, the prospect of serious economic consequences raises the stakes of a wider trade war 
between the two blocs. It is time for a negotiated settlement on the underlying issue: how the two sides support their 
aircraft makers.
For the aerospace industry and its cross-border supply chains there is much at stake. Boeing and Airbus have 
airline customers on both sides of the Atlantic. America's Delta Air Lines is a major Airbus customer, while in 
Europe, Ryanair and Lufthansa are big purchasers of Boeing jets. US politicians have acknowledged tariffs could 
hurt an Airbus facility in Mobile, Alabama, which imports parts to assemble the successful A320 jet and is a big 
source of local employment.
Battle for the skies risks a wider EU- US trade war An agreement on a new deal on aerospace support is long 
overdue
Both sides still enjoy a duopoly on large aircraft manufacturing but competitors are on the horizon, including from 
China. The potential damage goes well beyond the aerospace industry - under WTO rules, the US is not restricted 
to levying tariffs on Airbus planes. The list of additional targets identified by the US yesterday, which said it would 
apply levies albeit in a range of 10-25 per cent, includes Scotch whisky, cheeses and hand tools.
The dispute has dragged on for nearly 15 years. The US first raised concerns over alleged illegal repayable launch 
aid for Airbus in 2004. The EU followed suit and filed a counter-case, alleging illegal state aid to Boeing through 
government money for defence contracts and tax breaks. In 2010 and 2011 the WTO ruled that both manufacturers 
had received unlawful assistance. Yesterday's tariff decision relates to a 2018 ruling by the WTO that the EU had 
failed to eliminate unlawful aid to Airbus for its mediumsized A350 aircraft and the A380 superjumbo. The EU's own 
case against Boeing is running about nine months behind. The WTO in March upheld a finding that the US had not 
enforced an order in 2012 to stop subsidies to Boeing through a Washington tax break. Neither side has been able 
to agree on the terms for a meeting to agree a settlement. Airbus yesterday repeated its calls for talks. A decision 
on EU compliance with the WTO rulings is still pending and could lead to the US having to lift tariffs. An agreed 
settlement would need to set out recognised rules and disciplines that both the US and the EU can adhere to. 
Defining the role of governments will be critical.
There is now a potential window to strike a new agreement before either Boeing or Airbus launches a new aircraft. 
It would make sense to settle new terms of trade under a transparent and enforceable system. Otherwise the next 
15 years risk a repeat of the past decade and a half of tit-for-tat legal actions - as well as a mounting list of tariffs 
that could prove extremely costly for the global economy.

Europe and the US have been fighting over subsidies for their respective aircraft makers for more than a decade, 
long before President Donald Trump's feud with China and his "America first" strategy made such trade battles 
fashionable. Mr Trump has described the EU as "worse than China, just smaller". He has already threatened to 
impose tariffs on imported cars as a stick to persuade Europe to include agriculture in any trade talks. Much as he 
might relish the fight, the prospect of serious economic consequences raises the stakes of a wider trade war 
between the two blocs. It is time for a negotiated settlement on the underlying issue: how the two sides support their 
aircraft makers.
For the aerospace industry and its cross-border supply chains there is much at stake. Boeing and Airbus have 
airline customers on both sides of the Atlantic. America's Delta Air Lines is a major Airbus customer, while in 
Europe, Ryanair and Lufthansa are big purchasers of Boeing jets. US politicians have acknowledged tariffs could 
hurt an Airbus facility in Mobile, Alabama, which imports parts to assemble the successful A320 jet and is a big 
source of local employment.
Battle for the skies risks a wider EU- US trade war An agreement on a new deal on aerospace support is long 
overdue
Both sides still enjoy a duopoly on large aircraft manufacturing but competitors are on the horizon, including from 
China. The potential damage goes well beyond the aerospace industry - under WTO rules, the US is not restricted 
to levying tariffs on Airbus planes. The list of additional targets identified by the US yesterday, which said it would 
apply levies albeit in a range of 10-25 per cent, includes Scotch whisky, cheeses and hand tools.
The dispute has dragged on for nearly 15 years. The US first raised concerns over alleged illegal repayable launch 
aid for Airbus in 2004. The EU followed suit and filed a counter-case, alleging illegal state aid to Boeing through 
government money for defence contracts and tax breaks. In 2010 and 2011 the WTO ruled that both manufacturers 
had received unlawful assistance. Yesterday's tariff decision relates to a 2018 ruling by the WTO that the EU had 
failed to eliminate unlawful aid to Airbus for its mediumsized A350 aircraft and the A380 superjumbo. The EU's own 
case against Boeing is running about nine months behind. The WTO in March upheld a finding that the US had not 
enforced an order in 2012 to stop subsidies to Boeing through a Washington tax break. Neither side has been able 
to agree on the terms for a meeting to agree a settlement. Airbus yesterday repeated its calls for talks. A decision 
on EU compliance with the WTO rulings is still pending and could lead to the US having to lift tariffs. An agreed 
settlement would need to set out recognised rules and disciplines that both the US and the EU can adhere to. 
Defining the role of governments will be critical.
There is now a potential window to strike a new agreement before either Boeing or Airbus launches a new aircraft. 
It would make sense to settle new terms of trade under a transparent and enforceable system. Otherwise the next 
15 years risk a repeat of the past decade and a half of tit-for-tat legal actions - as well as a mounting list of tariffs 
that could prove extremely costly for the global economy.

The bell has rung on the latest round in the battle between the world's aviation heavyweights, Boeing and Airbus. 
This time a long-running phoney war threatens to turn into real hostilities. Under a ruling issued yesterday, 
arbitrators at the World Trade Organization gave the US the green light to levy tariffs on European goods worth up 
to almost $7.5bn per year - the largest amount ever authorised.
Europe and the US have been fighting over subsidies for their respective aircraft makers for more than a decade, 
long before President Donald Trump's feud with China and his "America first" strategy made such trade battles 
fashionable. Mr Trump has described the EU as "worse than China, just smaller". He has already threatened to 
impose tariffs on imported cars as a stick to persuade Europe to include agriculture in any trade talks. Much as he

Oct 03, 2019( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (RYA.I[1]) can wait out price 
rises sought by planemakers since the global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, the Irish airline's boss said on 
Tuesday (1 October), write Laurence Frost[2] and Tim Hepher[3].Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
(pictured) said his company can wait for prices to drop before placing any large orders.'I think we have to wait for 
the next turn in the cycle,' he said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London. 'At the moment there are no pricing 
opportunities on aircraft. The MAX has been grounded, Airbus are pricing up, Boeing are pricing up because 
they've nothing to sell.' 
Industry sources say Ryanair has begun commercial talks with Boeing over an order for a larger MAX variant that 
could be finalized once the current version returns to service. The price of the potential 737 MAX 10 order is 
expected to include sharper discounts in lieu of cash compensation for the grounding of the older variants, the 
sources have said. Ryanair has said it is interested in 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft for its recently acquired 
Laudamotion business and the 737 MAX 10 for its all-Boeing main fleet 'at the right price'. But O'Leary said the 
talks with Airbus were going slowly. While Laudamotion provided a platform to acquire Airbus planes into the 
Ryanair Group, the MAX grounding has not caused him to reconsider his policy of running just one aircraft type per 
airline, he said. Ryanair has 135 of a special 197-seat version of Boeing's grounded 737 MAX 8 planes on order 
and options for a further 75. The Boeing 737 MAX 10 is expected to have up to 230 seats. On Tuesday O'Leary 
said Ryanair is in 'continuous dialogue' with Boeing in the hope that 30-40 737 MAX jets could be operational by 
summer 2020, assuming the plane is cleared to return to service by the end of this year or soon after. Ryanair 
recently lowered the target for next year to 30 from 58 because of the delays caused by the grounding of the MAX 
fleet after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Before the MAX can return to service, U.S. and European 
aviation authorities need to approve software and training changes proposed by Boeing. A likely proliferation of 
European environmental taxes will eventually force more carriers out of business, O'Leary also predicted on 
Tuesday, while condemning proposals that would force low-cost carriers to bear the brunt of increased levies. 'It's 
going to hasten the consolidation of the industry,' O'Leary said. Governments including France and the Netherlands 
are introducing new airline taxes or considering doing so, with exemptions for connecting flights in a move that 
would help traditional network carriers such as Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA[4]). Germany, meanwhile, is considering 
imposing minimum ticket prices that would punish low-cost operators. 'You can't exempt connecting transfer traffic 
from environmental taxes,' O'Leary said, adding that such flights represent the most environmentally damaging 
#Ryanair can bide its time for better plane deals, says O'Leary
traffic because they involve two flights to reach their destination. Low-cost carriers account for a large share of 
Europe's recent and expected aviation emissions growth, but Ryanair's high load factors allow it to report lower 
carbon output than full-service rivals on a per-passenger basis. 'As we cram you all in together, you can take 
comfort from the fact that you're having the least impact on the environment of any passenger airline group in 
Europe,' 
O'Leary 
said.

Oct 03, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shutterstock Some 
airports name themselves after cities which, in reality, they are miles away from. Some of the worst offenders are 
almost 100 miles from their "home" cities. 
Here are the top six. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] A common complaint of travellers 
landing at several airports with London in their names is that they aren't in London at all. London Luton (32 miles,) 
London Southend (37 miles,) and London Stansted (36 miles) have named themselves "London" airports, despite 
all of them being located more than 30 miles from the capital. But there are far worse offenders from around the 
world who take the names of cities they're miles from. Here are the worst six. 6. Stockholm Vsters Airport - 62 miles 
from Stockholm, Sweden. Google MapsStockholm Vsters Airport is 62 miles west of Stockholm, Sweden's capital. 
Stockholm Vsters warns travellers that it wil take them at least 70 minutes to drive into Sweden's capital from the 
arrivals terminal. The airport flies to Spain and London, and is a Ryanair hub.5. Oslo-Torp Airport — 66 miles from 
Oslo, Norway. Google MapsOslo-Torp is 66 miles from Oslo city center. The train to get to the Oslo from the airport 
takes about 1 hours 45 minutes, according to the airport.4. Memmingen (Munich West) — 70 miles from Munich, 
Germany. Google MapsA bus runs from Munich central station to Memmingen Airport, which takes 1 hour and 20 
minutes. Flights from Memmingen go to France, Germany, Italy and Belgium.See the rest of the story at Business

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), a European budget carrier, said in a regulatory filing its pilots based in Germany have 
voted by a majority of 99% in favor of a four-year Collective Labour Agreement to cover all of the airline's directly 
employed pilots in Germany until March 2023.
The deal, negotiated between Ryanair and a trade union representing the pilots, will deliver a new pay structure 
along with a fixed roster. The duo has also agreed on a social plan to govern German base closures or cuts.
In a separate filing, the budget carrier said passenger traffic grew by more than 8% in September to 14.1 million 
from the year-ago period. On a rolling annual basis, the increase was more than 10% to 150.3 million.

Around 500 hotels in Spain likely to face imminent closure after Thomas Cook collapse
Around 500 hotels in Spain likely to face imminent closure after Thomas 
Cook collapse

Highlight: Several hundreds of hotels in Spain are likely to face closure following the collapse of British travel firm 
Thomas Cook, according to the Spanish hotel federation.
Body
Around 500 hotels in Spain are likely to face imminent closure and the situation is likely to worsen if the government 
does not take necessary steps, said Spain's Confederation of Hotels and Tourist Accommodation head Juan Molas 
to business daily Cinco Dias. Furthermore, the amount in unpaid bills due to the collapse of the global tour operator 
is expected to be much higher than the initial estimate of $220m, added Molas. 
Molas further added: "It will be much more. The amount for only eight chains is close to 100 million euros." This 
federation represents 15,000 businesses. Out of the hotels facing imminent closure, 100 were solely dependent on 
Thomas Cook, while the others depended for 30 to 70% of their clients, reported Agence France-Presse. A leading 
hotel at Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands is now faced with 700 rooms going  empty from this month, and is 
likely to axe 200 jobs. About 40% of the hotels worst hit are located in the Canaries and the Balearic Islands. Molas 
added that the industry has an emergency plan in place which will be presented to Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto 
at the  Spanish tourism board meeting on 7 October. This plan will also address the issue of air routes to the 
Canary Islands. Molas added: "The busy season is starting and Thomas Cook had 30 percent of air capacity." With 
the collapse of the holidaymaker, around 1.3 million airline seats will be impacted. The hotel federation urged the 
government to seek RyanAir to reconsider its plans to close four bases in Spain as it was critical that the budget 
airline maintain its flights for the growth of the tourism sector in the country.

Hargreaves Lansdown led the FTSE 100 fallers after both Credit Suisse and Panmure Gordon advised selling.
Hargreaves' higher than average pricing model and 65 per cent-plus operating profit margins might not be 
sustainable in the long term, given increased competition and the fallout from the Woodford Investment 
Management scandal, said Credit Suisse.
Meanwhile, Panmure argued that Hargreaves' need to invest would restrict future operational gearing.
Ferguson jumped after fourth-quarter results from the Americas-focused plumbing and heating supplier beat 
forecasts on cost savings and market share gains.
Greggs was the FTSE 250's biggest faller after the bakery chain reported a moderation in sales growth and left 
fullyear targets unchanged.
Ryanair led the airline stocks higher after Merrill Lynch advised buying.
The sector's recent underperformance versus the wider market has been the most severe for 15 years and could 
only be justified either by European recession or by Brent crude jumping to $95 a barrel, Merrill said.
Merrill also advised buying Wizz Air and British Airways owner IAG. Bryce Elder

Oct 01, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Britain on 
Tuesday launched an investigation into the auditors who signed off on accounts for the now-bankrupt holiday giant 
Thomas Cook, as the company's Belgian division finally collapsed.The Financial Reporting Council said in a 
statement that it will examine whether accountancy firm EY -- which replaced PwC as Thomas Cook's auditors in 
2017 -- acted properly in scrutinising its books."The FRC has commenced an investigation into the audit by EY of 
the financial statements of Thomas Cook Group Plc for the year ended 30 September 2018," it said.The regulator 
"will keep under close review both the scope of this investigation and the question of whether to open any other 
investigation in relation to Thomas Cook, liaising with other relevant regulators to the fullest extent permissible". If

involved.The FRC probe comes after a parliamentary business committee launched its own inquiry on Thursday

Jacobs."There needs to be new and improved type of stress tests put in place."If an airline is weak financially that 
airline and the shareholders should be forced by the CAA to put reserves aside to cover the cost of repatriating 
customers if they get to that situation."That's not the case today and hence the UK taxpayers are the ones paying 
the bill."The Department of Transport expects that the cost of the repatriation operation will come to about 100 
million (113 million euros, $124 million).burs-rfj/jh

Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary is frustrated that the Boeing 737 Max grounding is slowing the 
operator's capacity growth, but is "reasonably confident" that the aircraft will return to service in Europe by early 
2020.
The situation "will slow down our growth into summer 2020", O'Leary states during a Reuters Newsmakers 
discussion forum on 1 October, adding that "when an opportunity comes up like the failure of Thomas Cook... we 
want to be able to grow faster, not slower".
He adds that there could be further base cuts and job losses at the Irish carrier, if its expectation that the Max will 
be cleared to fly again "either this side of Christmas or maybe the far side of Christmas" proves too optimistic.
Those cuts would come despite Ryanair's moves to delay the exit of some 737NGs from its fleet to partially offset 
the lack of Max deliveries.
He notes, however, that amid his frustration over the Max situation, "safety is our main priority".
Reiterating earlier estimates that Ryanair would only be able to take about half of its Max backlog by the 2020 
summer season, O'Leary explains that at maximum capacity, the airline can receive eight new aircraft per month.

"If it's back flying by January/February... we could take maybe 30/40 aircraft for next year, but we won't be able to 
take all 60," he states, referring to the backlog of Max deliveries the carrier would have accrued by the 2020 
summer season.
E Ryanair 'reasonably confident' of 737 Max return by early 2020 Ryanair group chief executive Michael 
O'Leary is "reasonably confident" that the Boeing 737 Max....
"If it's slightly later than that, it could come down to 30. Most of our planning at the moment is based on 30 Max 
aircraft for next year."
Any further delay will mean "we have to look again at our summer 2020 capacity. That might involve more cuts and 
some more job losses," O'Leary says.
In early August, the Ryanair chief had already stated that "we will need about 600 less pilots and cabin crew for 
summer 2020" based on the assumption that the operator would receive around 30 Max jets during 2020.
Ryanair is taking steps to mitigate the impact of the Max grounding, O'Leary says, stating that "about 15 of our 
aircraft shortage next summer will be made up by postponing aircraft sales and extending leases".
He cites a deal reach with lessor GECAS, under which Ryanair will keep seven of 10 "older 737NGs" that the 
operator had originally intended to sell this winter.
"We're also extending some of the aircraft that are coming off lease at the moment," he says, adding: "I think it's 
seven or eight aircraft – we're extending leases for another 12 months."
Ryanair had been due to receive its first 737 Max 8 in April 2019, but Boeing suspended deliveries in March in the 
wake of the jets' global grounding.
Cirium fleets data shows that Ryanair has 423 737NGs in service. It has 135 Max 8s on firm order and holds 
options on a further 75.

Ryanair is negotiating with leasing companies affected by Thomas Cook's demise to take over several Airbus jets 
for use by its Austrian subsidiary Lauda.
Speaking at a briefing hosted by Thomson Reuters in London today, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said 
the plan was to boost Lauda's fleet for the summer 2020 schedule.
The number of aircraft would depend on asset pricing and company's capacity to recruit and train pilots ahead of 
the summer season, he says.
Lauda's fleet comprises 21 Airbus A320ceos, a mixture of CFM International CFM56- and International Aero 
Engines V2500-powered aircraft, Cirium fleets data shows.
Beyond Thomas Cook's fleet, O'Leary sees opportunity to increase the Ryanair group's A320 fleet with second-
hand aircraft.
He says "lots of leasing companies are taking back 8-10-year-old Ceos" as airlines introduce A320neos.
Ryanair is in talks with both Boeing and Airbus about possible future aircraft orders for delivery beyond its existing 
fleet plan, which runs until 2024. But O'Leary concedes that discussions with Airbus are "not going very fast".
He currently sees "no pricing opportunity" with either airframer as Boeing concentrates on returning the 737 Max to 
service while Airbus ramps up production to deliver its A320neo backlog.
As "pricing is up" at both airframers, he says that Ryanair will "have to wait until the next turn of the cycle".
Cirium fleets data shows that Ryanair, its UK division, its Polish subsidiary Buzz, and Malta Air together have 456 
737NGs in service.

Ryanair is in talks with a number of leasing companies about the prospect of transferring their aircraft from Thomas 
Cook to Lauda.
Speaking at a media event in London on 1 October, Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary said that the 
airline group was holding talks with undisclosed lessors about deploying former Thomas Cook aircraft with its 
Austrian subsidiary for the summer 2020 season.
Thomas Cook Group filed for insolvency on 23 September. While some parts of the group's former European 
business continue to operate, Thomas Cook Airlines UK has been grounded.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows that the airline has a fleet of 39 aircraft, consisting of three Airbus A320s, 
28 A321s and eight A330s.
The majority of these are leased. Of Thomas Cook's lessors, Aviation Capital Group is most exposed, with nine 
aircraft placed with the defunct leisure carrier, while five were placed by Air Lease and four by ICBC Leasing. 
O'Leary did not specify how far these talks had progressed.
Ryanair took an almost 25% stake in Lauda in March 2018 and went on to acquire the remaining 75% from owner 
Niki Lauda in August of that year. The carrier operates a fleet of leased A320s.
O'Leary said that over the past 12 months Ryanair had discerned a "sweet spot" for A320 lease rates.
He believes this was the result of Airbus having been "so successful" with sales of the A320neo, leading to the 
return of used current-generation aircraft between eight and 10 years old on fuel efficiency grounds.
When Ryanair took over Lauda it was operating A320s leased from Lufthansa, which O'Leary claimed was charging 
the Vienna-based airline $400,000 per month per aircraft.
Ryanair has since managed to replace these aircraft with 22 A320s from other lessors at an average monthly lease 
rental cost of under $200,000 per month, O'Leary said.

Ryanair is slowing down its aircraft phase-outs and extending existing lease terms in response to the grounding of 
the Boeing 737 Max, Ryanair Group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary has disclosed.
Speaking at a media briefing in London on 1 October, O'Leary said that as a result of the grounding the low-cost 
carrier (LCC) would retain the services for the summer 2020 period of seven of 10 737NGs it has sold to GECAS. 
These aircraft will now be delivered to the lessor in the winter of 2020.
The lease agreements on a further seven or eight 737s are also being extended by another 12 months. O'Leary 
said this would give the Irish carrier extra capacity from approximately 15 "short" aircraft next summer.
He estimates that the 737 Max could be recertified and back in service in North America "this side of Christmas", 
and could return to European skies "this side of Christmas or the other side of Christmas".
He said he was "reasonably confident" that the Max would be back flying for Ryanair during the summer of 2020.
Ryanair is working to an assumption that it will take delivery of 30 737 Max aircraft in 2020, of a backlog of 60 of the 
type.
The airline can take a maximum of eight new aircraft a month, he added.
"We are in continuous dialogue with Boeing. If it's back flying by January, February, March next year we could 
maybe take delivery of 30 or 40 next year, but it won't be 60," he said.
The Max grounding also means Ryanair cannot take advantage of the collapse of rivals such as Thomas Cook, 
which filed for insolvency earlier this month, because it is growing more slowly than expected.
While Ryanair is talking to Boeing about compensation for the disruption caused by the grounding, O'Leary said 
such negotiations could not be concluded until the aircraft had returned to commercial service.
He added that Ryanair is in talks with both Boeing and Airbus about the prospect of "new aircraft" orders.
The airline already has 200 aircraft on order which would be "more than enough" to take it through to 2024, he said.
Ryanair extends 737NG leases over Max grounding
Instead, discussions are focused on opportunities for new aircraft to be delivered in 2023, 2024 and 2025.
O'Leary said that both Boeing and Airbus are "pricing up" at the moment which mean there are"no pricing 
opportunities" for the LCC to exploit.
"I think we will have to wait until the next of the turn of the cycle and there will be another turn of the aircraft cycle 
between now and 2024," he said.
O'Leary said Ryanair would reach a "capex peak" in 2020 in the region of (EURO)2.2 billion, most of which would 
be "internally generated".
As a result, it is "unlikely" the airline would initiate a share buyback programme next year, he added.
O'Leary said Ryanair had no plans to issue a bond in 2020 and would in fact seek to pay down existing debt.
He said the airline has $300 million to $400 million of US Ex-Im bank debt with a coupon of 2-3%, which once 
seemed like "the cheapest money in history [but] now it's the most expensive debt we have, so we will be paying 
down that debt next year".

Easyjet full-year profit to be in "~upper half' of guidance

Easyjet expects to deliver a full-year pre-tax profit in the "upper half" of its previous guidance after a fourth quarter 
in which it reaped the benefits of operational efficiencies and strike action at rivals Ryanair and British Airways.
The UK carrier forecasts a profit of between £420 million and £430 million ($508 million to $520 million) for the year 
after a quarter ending 30 September which was characterised by "yield optimisation self-help initiatives" and 
"increased demand" due to industrial action impacting rivals.
The carrier said its operational resilience programmes had helped it to offset a "difficult disruption environment", 
which included the impact of storms across Europe and technical issues at Gatwick airport.
Passenger numbers for the full year should increase by 8.6% to 96 million, driven by an increase in capacity of 
10.3% to 105 million seats. Load factor for the full-year will decrease by 1.4 percentage points to 91.5%.
Total revenue per seat at constant currency for the full year will decrease by circa 2.7% and total headline cost will 
increase by circa 12% due to "increased capacity, higher unit fuel costs and adverse foreign exchange 
movements". This increase was partially offset by improvements in cost per seat ex fuel, Easyjet said.
Total fuel costs are expected to be around £1.42 billion, which includes an adverse impact of foreign exchange and 
increased European emissions trading system costs.
Total headline foreign exchange will have a year-on-year adverse impact of around £14 million.
The Luton-based carrier said it will publish its full-year results in November.
First quarter 2020 forward bookings are currently "in line" with the same time last year. Easyjet's expects capacity 
growth for full-year 2020 to be at the lower end of its historic range.

Britain's decision to leave the European Union will have no long-term impact on Ryanair, Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary said on Tuesday, adding that the UK would need an EU trade deal and it was unrealistic to think otherwise.
"If you look out long enough, I don't think Brexit has any affect on our business," O'Leary said at a Reuters 
Newsmaker event in London, adding that he thought Britain and the EU would reach a trade deal and retain the 
Open Skies aviation agreement.
"The UK's national interest is best served, I think, by staying in the European Union. It's nuts to leave it, but if you 
are going to leave, the first thing you've got to do on the day after you leave is renegotiate a trade deal with the 
European Union." (Reuters)

500 Spain Hotels 'To Close Immediately' After Thomas Cook Fall: Industry
500 Spain Hotels 'To Close Immediately' After Thomas Cook Fall: Industry

Sep 30, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Hundreds of 
hotels in Spain are facing imminent closure over the collapse of British travel giant Thomas Cook, the head of the 
Spanish hotel federation warned on Monday."There are 500 hotels which are going to close immediately due to the 
collapse of Thomas Cook and the situation could get worse if the government doesn't take immediate action," Juan 
Molas, head of Spain's Confederation of Hotels and Tourist Accommodation, told business daily Cinco Dias.And the 
sum in unpaid bills left by the demise of the tour operator would be much higher than the initial estimate of 200 
million euros ($220 million), said Molas, whose organisation represents 15,000 businesses."It will be much more. 
The amount for only eight chains is close to 100 million." 
Of those hotels facing immediate closure, 100 were exclusively dependent on Thomas Cook, he said, while the rest 
counted on the firm for between 30 and 70 percent of their clients.One hotel in Fuerteventura, the second largest of 
the Canary Islands, had recently undergone a 20-million-euro upgrade and was now faced with 700 rooms "which 
are going to be empty from October 7" and 200 employees it would be forced to dismiss.Worst hit are those in the 
Canaries and the Balearic Islands, where 40 percent of hotels are affected.The industry has put together an 
emergency plan to be presented to Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto at the next Spanish tourism board meeting on 
October 7 which will also address the urgent question of air links with the Canary Islands.Industry experts fear the 
impact there could be even more devastating than elsewhere as the resort is very popular as a winter destination 
among tourists from northern Europe."The busy season is starting and Thomas Cook had 30 percent of air 
capacity," Molas said, indicating the disappearance of the package holidaymaker could affect some 1.3 million 
airline seats, with Tenerife and Lanzarote particularly badly hit.He urged the government to contact RyanAir, one of 
the few carriers that flies there, to urge the budget airline "to reconsider" plans to close four bases in Spain, three of 
them in the Canaries, saying it was "critical" that the airline maintain its flights.

A fuel tax would be more effective at cutting aviation's carbon emissions than the European Union's Emissions 
Trading Scheme (ETS) and the array of national environmental taxes currently emerging across Europe, Kenny 
Jacobs, chief marketing officer at Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), has told Aviation International News. The combination 
of the ETS and the new national taxes will distort competition as they protect legacy carriers and large hubs instead 
of reducing carbon emissions, he argued.

Karpukhin Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has discovered cracks in a vital part of its Boeing 737 Next Generation 
planes that connects the body of the aircraft to its wings, CNN affiliate KOMO first reported[1]. Boeing discovered 
the "cracking issue" in a small number of planes, the company said in a statement. The Federal Aviation 
Administration has ordered operators to inspect the planes for structural cracks. Boeing's website lists more than 
100 airlines as customers of 737 NG planes. 
The 737 Max, which was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes, is not affected by this issue. Visit 
Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has discovered a "cracking issue" in 
a vital part of its Boeing 737 Next Generation planes that connects the body of the aircraft to its wings, Charlie 
Harger at CNN affiliate KOMO first reported[3]. The aircraft piece in question, known as a "pickle fork," helps 
connect the plane's body to its wings. Pickle forks are designed to last the life of the plane, which is usually around 
90,000 or more take offs and landings the publication reported. But, in one instance, Boeing found cracked pickle 
forks in a plane that had logged about 35,000 take offs and landings, according to KOMO. The Federal Aviation 
Administration has ordered operators of 737 NG planes to inspect the aircraft for structural cracks, according to a 
statement shared with Business Insider. Boeing reported the issue to the FAA after it discovered the cracks while 
modifying a "heavily used aircraft," according to the statement. The company found similar cracks in a small 
number of other planes, as well. Boeing said in a statement it has notified operators of the issue, and that the 
planes with cracks are "undergoing modifications." No in-service issues have been reported, the company said. 
Boeing's website lists more than 100 airlines as 737 NG customers, including American Airlines, Delta Airlines, 
EgyptAir, RyanAir, and Southwest Airlines. The 737 NG models include 737-700, 7370-800, and 737-900 aircraft. 
The 737 Max is not affected by the cracking issue, the company said. That model was grounded in March after two 
fatal plane crashes. Read more: The complete history of the 737 Max, Boeing's promising yet problematic

Sep 27, 2019( BANG ShowBiz: http://www.bangshowbiz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Jack Whitehall has been told 
to act "more relatable" to keep his fans on board.The 'Jungle Cruise' actor and comedian is currently on tour, and 
he admitted his own team have told him he needs to appear more down-to-earth to ensure he doesn't alienate any 
o his fans.Speaking during a talk at London's Southbank Centre this week, he's quoted by The Sun newspaper's 
Bizarre column as saying: "I've just started doing a tour and I've been told I need to look more relatable, so I now 
need to lie and pretend that I fly on Ryanair and not boujee airlines."They also told me I need to stop talking about 
Waitrose on stage. They say I talk about Waitrose too much, so now I have to pretend I'm a normal person and 
shop at Lidl."The 30-year-old comic is no stranger to luxury, and he was selected to provide the entertainment for 
Prince Charles' annual staff Christmas Party last year.However, Jack admitted he "absolutely died" on stage in front 
of the 70-year-old royal with none of his material going down well at all.He recalled: "It was an honor to be asked to 
do the Christmas party of Prince Charles... he throws [his staff] a Christmas party each year... and I was the 
entertainment that year. 
It's the weirdest gig ever."I walk out, first thing that's weird is that they're sat in the front row, Charles and Camilla, in 
thrones... Also, don't sit in the front row because that's your get-out-of-jail-free card as a comic, [you pick on the 
front row], you ask them what they do for a living... I can't ask Prince Charles what he does for a living!"[It was a] 
small room, maybe 40 people, all of my material was terrible... I absolutely died."And things only got worse for Jack 
as he overheard the prince suggesting to his wife, Duchess Camilla, that they opt for a very different form of 
entertainment in future.He added: "And the worst bit was, when I was walking off because nobody was applauding, 
it was the worst review I've ever got, I heard Charles turn to Camilla as I was leaving the stage and he went 'I think 
next year we'll try a magician'... There goes the knighthood!"

Ryanair has no Condor takeover plans but doesn't rule out investment

Budget airline Ryanair is not interested in buying Thomas Cook subsidiary Condor but would consider acquiring 
parts of the German holiday carrier if it is split up to guarantee competition, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary 
said Thursday.
The head of Europe's largest budget carrier charged that the German government's recent 380-million-euro (420-
million-dollar) bridge loan for Condor was in preparation for Lufthansa buying another German airline and gaining 
market dominance.
"This is yet another fattening up of a German turkey," O'Leary told a press conference in Vienna, the base of 
Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion.
British tour operator Thomas Cook collapsed and filed for liquidation on Monday, leaving tens of thousands of 
holidaymakers stranded. Unlike its parent company, Condor is solvent and continues to operate, but has obtained a 
bridging loan to guard against potential liquidity shortages.
O'Leary said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager should not only look at US giants like 
Amazon and Google, but at Germany's Lufthansa. He pointed to the German carrier's past acquisition of troubled 
Air Berlin.
If Lufthansa ended up swallowing Condor, "we would expect there to be competition divestments" that might be of 
interest to Ryanair, the head of Ireland-based airline said.
Lufthansa made a non-binding offer for Condor in May but has not confirmed this week whether it is still interested. 
However, Lufthansa has never officially withdrawn its bid.

Flier growth at Southend helps Stobart Group
Flier growth at Southend helps Stobart Group

STOBART Group yesterday said it is trading in line with expectations and has made "considerable progress" during 
the first half of the year.
The aviation, energy and civil engineering group suffered a bruising boardroom battle last year, resulting in the 
ousting of former boss Andrew Tinkler.
Stobart made "strong commercial progress" in its aviation and energy divisions during the first half, the group said 
in a trading update issued ahead of the publication of its interim results for the six months to 31 August on 14 
November.
Passenger numbers at London Southend Airport, which the group owns, increased 42 per cent compared to the 
same period last year.
The group said this growth was driven by Ryanair starting flights from the airport in April, and Loganair flights in 
May. The successful growth of Easyjet flights and the introduction of early and late rail services between Liverpool 
Street station and the airport.
Wizzair will begin flying from London Southend to three new destinations from October, which Stobart said would 
help keep passenger numbers increasing in line with its target. Stobart said it is taking a cautious approach to 
passenger forecasts "given the ongoing uncertainty in the sector, in part caused by Brexit".
In the group's energy division, the volume of waste managed - which is primarily processed into waste wood fuel - 
increased by 148,000 tonnes to 806,000 tones. The equivalent run rate of 1.7m tonnes per year represents a 22 per 
cent increase, Stobart said.
Flier growth at Southend helps Stobart Group
"Stobart Group has made considerable progress in the period. I am particularly encouraged by the airline partners 
we are working with," said chief executive Warwick Brady.

Aer Lingus owner IAG warned on Thursday full-year operating pretax profit will be 215 million euros lower than last 
year, as major pilot strikes grounded thousands of flights.
IAG, which reported a profit of 3.49 billion euros last year, expects the strikes to hit the company by 137 million 
euros, with a further 33 million euro impact because of "threatened strikes" by Heathrow Airport employees.
The strikes in September backed by the pilots' union, the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), led to an initial 
cancellation of 4,521 flights over seven days.
British Airways pilots had cancelled a strike set for Sept. 27 to create time for talks. BA has offered its pilots an 
11.5% pay rise over three years.
"There have been no further talks between British Airways and BALPA," the company said on Thursday.
The airline, whose competition includes easyJet, Ryanair and other low-cost airlines, estimates booking trends in its 
low cost segments will be hurt by 45 million euros.
Shares were seen falling 5% to 7%, according to premarket indicators. (Reuters)

Sep 26, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL -September 26, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. 
Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SkyWest, Inc. SKYW[1], Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[2], Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA[3] and Global Partners LP GLP[4].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst 
Blog:Buy These Stocks as Oil Slips to Lowest Since Aramco AttacksOil prices slumped more than 2% on Sep 24, 
touching the lowest level since the attacks on Saudi Arabia's key oil production facilities. 
This has been primarily led by President Trump's disturbing rhetoric in relation to the trade conflict with 
China.Trump accused China of manipulating its currency and stealing intellectual property, in a U.N. speech. He 
specified that he won't accept a "bad deal" in trade talks with China. It's worth pointing out that China is the world's 
largest importer of oil and also the second-largest crude user. The United States, in the meanwhile, is the largest 
consumer of oil.Such developments are working against the oil market, especially, after oil rallied last week 
following a crippling attack on Saudi oil installations. The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have 
removed nearly 5% of global supplies.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the attack was a 'state-on-
state act of war' by Iran, but the United States is still committed toward finding a diplomatic solution with Iran. U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper added that the United States will send troops to Saudi Arabia but that would be 
'defensive in nature.' U.S. treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that 'the United States will continue its 
maximum pressure campaign against Iran's repressive regime, which attempts to achieve its revolutionary agenda 
through regional aggression while squandering the country's oil proceeds.'The coordinated drone strikes affected 
the world's largest oil procession plant. In fact, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 
5.7 million barrels a day of crude oil and gas have been affected.Nonetheless, oil prices extended losses after 
industry data showed unanticipated buildup in U.S. crude stockpiles. The American Petroleum Institute said that 
U.S. crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels last week, way more than analysts' estimate of 200,000-barrel 
drawdown.But, the drop in crude oil prices has been a blessing for aviation and refinery companies. Here's why —
Aviation, Refiners Poised to GainAviation stocks traditionally have an inverse relationship with the movement of oil 
prices. So, it isn't surprising that shares of aviation firms are rising after the sharp drop in oil. As fuel costs form a 
major part of the operating costs for aviation firms, a rise in oil prices eats into profit margins.Refineries also stand 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: SkyWest , Ryanair , Copa and Global Partners
to gain from the drop in crude oil prices. Refineries buy crude oil as their raw materials. So, refineries' net cash flow 
declines if crude oil prices rise. Meanwhile, their net cash flow increases when crude oil prices fall.4 Solid PicksWe 
have, thus, selected four such stocks from the aforesaid areas that are poised to make the most of the crude oil fall. 
These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).SkyWest, Inc. operates a regional airline in the 
United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings

scheduled-passenger airline services. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 
current-year earnings has moved up 0.5% in the last 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the 
next year is 32.4% compared with the Transportation - Airline industry's projected rally of 15.3%.Copa Holdings, 
S.A. provides airline passenger and cargo services. The company offers flights to 81 destinations in 33 countries in 
North, Central, and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The company has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 10.8% in the last 60 days. The company's

Headlines from the Proactive UK newsroom.Oilfield services group Enteq (LON:NTQ) says first half revenues will 
be more than 50% higher than the same period last year while underlying profits have more than doubled. Both 
numbers are ahead of management expectations. Passenger numbers at Southend Airport increased by 42% in the 
six months to 31 August 2019, compared to the same period last year said owner Stobart (LON:STOB). Ryanair 
flights started in April, Loganair flights in May and easyJet's growth continued.J Sainsbury (LON:SBRY) is to stop 
selling new mortgages, close between 10-15 supermarkets and 60-70 Argos stores. These actions along with the 
weather will knock 50mln off interim profits but save 500mln over five years. Premier League football club 
Manchester United's revenues hit another record in the year to July in spite of a mediocre season on the pitch. That 
will affect this year with revenues and profits predicted to fall.Savannah Resources (LON:SAV) says that as well as 
lithium, its Mina do Barroso project in Portugal also contains substantial quantities of quartz and feldspar. These 
can be recovered and sold to local ceramic and glass companies.

Sep 25, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Southwest Airlines LUV[1] issued an upbeat guidance for third-quarter 2019 unit cost growth. According to this 
Dallas-based low-cost carrier, its prudent expense management and the shift of certain cost items from the third to 
the fourth quarter of 2019 were the primary reasons behind the trimmed cost guidance.Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] 
also dominated the headlines following its CEO Michael O'Leary's decision related to Boeing 737 MAX jets in the 
company's fleet. Per O'Leary, this European low-cost carrier might resume flying the currently grounded 737 MAX 
jets by late February or early March next year. Ryanair also stated that its UK-based cabin crew approved a four-
year collective deal.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines' DAL[3] steady initiatives for expanding its presence globally are 
commendable. 
The company intends to start operating additional flights between the United States and Europe next year. JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[4] took a significant step related to its fleet-modernization initiatives, with its new Airbus A321neo jet 
commencing passenger service officially.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here[5]).Recap of Past Week's Most 
Important Stories1. Southwest Airlines canceled 600 flights in September due to Hurricane Dorian. However, the 
company does not expect the flight cancellations to significantly hurt its third-quarter 2019 results, scheduled to be 
released on Oct 24. Owing to upbeat demand for air travel and strong passenger yields, the carrier still expects its 
third-quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to increase in the 3-5% range on a year-over-year 
basis.Moreover, non-fuel unit costs are now estimated to increase between 8% and 10% compared with the 9-11% 
uptick anticipated previously. (Read more: Southwest Buoys Hope With Q3 Unit Cost Guidance Cut[6]).2. Ryanair, 
which has been engulfed with labor-related problems for quite a while, received encouraging tidings on the front 
from its pilots and cabin crew in the UK, represented by the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), cancelled 
their plans of going on strike for five days in September. Instead they agreed to resume discussions with the carrier 
on the points of dispute. Furthermore, the carrier's UK-based cabin crew voted overwhelmingly in favor of a pay-
related deal.Furthermore, at its annual general meeting, O'Leary issued an update on the currently grounded 
Boeing 737 MAX jets. Notably, Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest 737 MAX customers, with 135 firm aircraft orders 
and 75 options. (Read more: Ryanair Hopes to Fly Boeing 737 MAX Next February or March[7]).Ryanair carries a 
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].3. As 
part of its efforts to expand in Europe and provide passengers with increased options, Delta aims to operate four 
additional trans-Atlantic flights from Boston next year (transatlantic capacity is expected to be expanded more than 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV Trims Q3 Cost Guidance, RYAAY , DAL in Focus
30% next year). This will include new seasonal (summer: May 21-Sep 7) service to Rome, the introduction of a 
second daily flight to Paris apart from additional flights to London-Gatwick and Manchester from Boston. (Read 
more: Delta to Introduce More Flights Connecting US ...rope[9]).4. The entry of the first highly fuel-efficient (20% 
increase in fuel efficiency compared with the existing fleet) Airbus A321neo planes into scheduled service might 
enable JetBlue serve new markets as these planes boast a 500 nautical mile increase in range. The first flight was 
from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport 
(FLL). The carrier stated that flights connecting New York JFK to Guayaquil, Ecuador, (scheduled to begin on Dec 
5, 2019) and to Georgetown, Guyana, (scheduled to begin on Apr 2, 2020) will be operated by these new 
jets.Notably, JetBlue placed orders for 85 such jets long back. However, deliveries of the same were delayed due to 
production issues at Airbus. The first of these planes, equipped with modern facilities like a brand-new cabin and 
new in-flight entertainment system, were delivered in late June this year. The A321neo has now started flying 
passengers after test flights were conducted for some time following delivery by Airbus. JetBlue had stated in July 
that it expects to receive five more such jets in 2019.5 In a customer-friendly move, United Airlines UAL[10] has 
decided to introduce PlusPoints in a bid to usher in new upgrade benefits for its MileagePlus Premier members. 
The new system will be effective from Dec 4, 2019. The Chicago-based carrier aims to replace the existing 
Regional Premier Upgrades (RPU) and Global Premier Upgrades (GPU) with PlusPoints. Each RPU and GPU will 
be worth 20 and 40 PlusPoints, respectively. PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the

Sep 25, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] gets respite from strike actions by its UK-based cabin crew as the trade union UNITE representing the 
airline's UK crew votes in favor of a four-year collective labour deal.The agreement valid until 2023 will cover all 
employees of the carrier's UK crew. 80% of the members of the union voted in support of the labor contract, which 
will introduce a pay structure with higher guaranteed income and returning to a 5/3 roster.The 5/3 schedule includes 
early duty for five days followed by three days off and five days of late duty followed by three days off.Ryanair 
Holdings PLC Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-fundamental/price 
Ryanair Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] On another positive note, the trade union British 
Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA), representing Ryanair's UK-based pilots, recently called off five strikes that were 
set to take place in the remainder of September. 
Following this considerate move by the pilots, the discount carrier invited BALPA to resume negotiations with the 
company.Earlier in the month, amid Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's statements on his pilot lay-off (due to 
oversupply) plans and failed strike actions by unions, the BALPA accused the management of threatening pilots 
"with the removal of staff travel benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary" in case they participate 
in walkouts.However, O'Leary denied such allegations saying that "it is illegal to blacklist someone for being 
involved" in trade unions. He further added that "it has never happened, but we have been accused of it for around 
30 years now."Zacks Rank ...her Key PicksRyanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the

Ryanair has been criticised for threatening to take disciplinary action against pilots who have suffered more than 
four bouts of sick leave in a year, in a further flashpoint in the carrier's fraught labour relations.
Pilots who have taken more than four chunks of sick leave over a 12-month period have been sent letters as part of 
a review of "pilot absenteeism", according to people familiar with the matter.
The letters, several of which have been seen by the Financial Times, state that without an "immediate and 
significant improvement" in attendance, disciplinary action might be necessary. The European Cockpit Association, 
which brings together 36 national pilots' unions, has raised concerns over the approach to sick leave with the 
European Aviation Safety Agency. In June, the Ryanair Transnational Pilot Group, formed to provide a voice for 
pilots across Europe, sent an update to members saying it was aware that letters continued to be sent.
"Any airline that puts an arbitrary limit on how many times or days its pilots can get sick is playing with fire," said 
Philip von Schöppenthau, ECA secretary-general. "The effect of such a policy would be to encourage presenteeism 
at work among pilots and put pressure on them to fly an aircraft while sick." Easa and EU rules say pilots cannot 
perform duties on board an aircraft when unfit due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness or other conditions. 
Ryanair said: "Like all employers, Ryanair monitors and manages absenteeism. Absence management is a normal 
part of the employer/employee relationship in all businesses." The carrier has been negotiating collective labour 
agreements with unions since it agreed to recognise them in late 2017, after a rostering failure led to thousands of 
flight cancellations.
Pilots hit at Ryanair effort to manage absenteeism Airlines
Talks have progressed fitfully, and the airline has faced intermittent strike action over the past year over pay and 
conditions.
The British Airline Pilots' Association has carried out seven days of walkouts over August and September, while 
members of Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, have gone on strike this week. The walkouts have so far had little 
impact on operations.
One Ryanair pilot said the airline's approach was worrying. "Even something as simple as a head cold that would 
not stop an office worker performing their job, you can rupture your eardrums at altitude. You cannot have pilots or 
anyone in a safety-critical job that is not 100 per cent for duty."
The letters say some absence is unavoidable but "excessive absence" disrupts customers and places unfair 
pressure on colleagues who have to be drafted in, often at short notice.
John Moore, head of industrial relations at Balpa, said Ryanair's approach is "out of line" with other UK airlines.

WEAK German economic data weighed on banking shares yesterday, offsetting a surge in travel operators and 
airlines after the collapse of Thomas Cook.
The FTSE 100 fell 0.3 per cent at 7,326.08 points, with financials and mining stocks dragging the most, while the 
FTSE 250 mid-caps shed 0.6 per cent to 20,043.79.
Global miners such as Glencore and Antofagasta weakened over a lack of clarity in US-China trade talks.
"Trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world are having an impact around the global, and the 
dreadful manufacturing figures from Germany this morning is a great example of how the problem spills out beyond 
the US and China," CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.
The collapse of Thomas Cook spurred buying in tour operator TUI, airlines Ryanair and Easyjet and British Airways 
owner IAG, as investors anticipated the tour operator's closure would cut capacity in the saturated European 
holiday market.

Tui led the FTSE 100 gainers as the collapse of Thomas Cook raised hopes of tighter package holiday supply and 
improved pricing. Tui and Thomas Cook overlapped in key markets including the UK, Germany and the Nordics, 
said Barclays. It forecast that if Tui picked up £2bn of Thomas Cook's revenue it would add 4 per cent to group 
trading profit.
On The Beach gained even after cautioning that it would take the cost of covering Thomas Cook's cancelled flights 
as a one-off exceptional charge. Analysts saw a £7m cost this year, or a fifth of adjusted annual pre-tax profit, but 
saw the chance to gain some of Thomas Cook's 2.5m customers as more important for the long term.
Thomas Cook's failure also helped the airlines, with easyJet and Ryanair up on hopes that reduced short-haul 
capacity would lift ticket prices.
Marks and Spencer faded on the exit of chief financial officer Humphrey Singer.
Auto Trader edged lower after UBS cut forecasts and repeated "sell" advice. Used car dealers tracked by the broker 
had 6 per cent fewer cars on their websites than a year ago. If Auto Trader was seeing similar falls it might have to 
cut guidance at half-year results due in November, UBS said. Bryce Elder

Tui led the FTSE 100 gainers as the collapse of Thomas Cook raised hopes of tighter package holiday supply and 
improved pricing. Tui and Thomas Cook overlapped in key markets including the UK, Germany and the Nordics, 
said Barclays. It forecast that if Tui picked up £2bn of Thomas Cook's revenue it would add 4 per cent to group 
trading profit.
On The Beach gained even after cautioning that it would take the cost of covering Thomas Cook's cancelled flights 
as a one-off exceptional charge. Analysts saw a £7m cost this year, or a fifth of adjusted annual pre-tax profit, but 
saw the chance to gain some of Thomas Cook's 2.5m customers as more important for the long term.
Thomas Cook's failure also helped the airlines, with easyJet and Ryanair up on hopes that reduced short-haul 
capacity would lift ticket prices.
Marks and Spencer faded on the exit of chief financial officer Humphrey Singer.
Auto Trader edged lower after UBS cut forecasts and repeated "sell" advice. Used car dealers tracked by the broker 
had 6 per cent fewer cars on their websites than a year ago. If Auto Trader was seeing similar falls it might have to 
cut guidance at half-year results due in November, UBS said. Bryce Elder

SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images Airfare prices for routes previously served by travel company Thomas Cook are 
surging in the wake of its collapse. Travellers found tickets with rival airlines like Jet2, British Airways, Ryanair, and 
TUI to have gone up as much as 400% since Thomas Cook abruptly stopped operations on Monday. The collapse 
left 600,000 people stranded around the world, and many with now-worthless bookings for future flights. Airlines 
responded by saying that their prices are determined by market forces. 
Industry analysts say that increases are the inevitable consequence of a provider collapsing. Visit Business 
Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Airlines are being accused of inflating their flight prices by as much as 
400% after the collapse of UK airline Thomas Cook[2]. Travelers booking flights since the company's collapse on 
Monday say that prices have soared. Thomas Cook ran dozens of flights a day, and its collapse left 600,000 
stranded around the world. Customers with future bookings have found their trips cancelled, and must rebook with 
rival operators if they still want to travel. One traveler said on Monday that the cost of a flight with British budget

spokesman told Business Insider: "TUI uses a dynamic pricing model which means that our prices can go up or 
down. There are many variables which have to be taken in to account including peak dates of travel, regional airport 
differences and which channel our customers book through." The Sun also reported on a Ryanair flight from 
England to Spain that increased from 113 to 226. Business Insider has contacted Ryanair about increased flight 
prices.Experts say the price increases are inevitableJohn Strickland, an airline analyst at JLS Consulting, told the 
BBC: "People aren't sitting there rubbing their hands with glee. If sales come in rapidly on popular routes then 
prices go up."Jack Sheldon, founder of flight price website Jack's Flight Club, told the UK's Guardian newspaper[12] 
that this always happens. He said: "When a particular route ceases to operate, prices do indeed increase 
substantially, but this generally occurs over a matter of weeks and months. I expect it will be similar in this case as 
the additional demand will increase prices on other carriers." Read more: The UK expects to spend 100 million 
flying back stranded Thomas Cook passengers, which is only 50 million less than bailing out the company[13] Lisa 
Tyndall, a spokeswoman for flight comparison website Skyscanner, told the newspaper: "We typically see prices 
increase for key routes when an airline ceases trading, before reverting back again soon after."Travellers have 
been sharing how the collapse has ruined their plans[14], including people who had expected to fly for their 
weddings. Most people now looking to book new flights are those who have had their future trips ruined. Those who 
booked package holidays through Thomas Cook should eventually get a refund, but this is not the case for those 
who only booked flights through the company.The UK government is flying home the 15o,ooo British people now 
stuck abroad. Thomas Cook's biggest routes were places like Greece, Italy, Turkey, Spain, and the Caribbean. It 
also offers package holidays in the winter, which could mean that winter travel prices are also affected. Read more

Sep 23, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  European stock 
markets fell on Monday after a key survey pointed to weakness in the eurozone economy while some travel and 
tourism stocks benefitted from the collapse of British giant Thomas Cook.Both Frankfurt and Paris fell by around 
one percent after data from a closely watched survey showed that Brexit and trade war fears drove eurozone 
business growth to its lowest level in six years in September.IHS Markit's composite eurozone PMI, seen as a key 
indicator of business confidence, fell to 50.4 in September, down from 51.9 in August -- the lowest reading since 
June 2013.It warned that the single currency area's economy was "close to stalling". Market analyst David Madden 
at CMC Markets UK said "disappointing manufacturing and services reports from France, in addition to Germany, 
has weighed on European stock markets."Investors now need to weigh "German recession odds against central 
bank support", added Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com.The euro also slid lower. Thomas Cook 
fallout Some rivals of British travel giant Thomas Cook, which declared bankruptcy after last-ditch re-financing 
attempts failed, saw their shares rise sharply.TUI shares, listed in London, shot six percent higher.Ryanair gained 
1.4 percent and easyJet 4.5 percent, but British Airways parent IAG shed 1.3 percent.In Hong Kong, China's Fosun 
International lost 1.5 percent after the collapse of Thomas Cook, in which it is the top shareholder.The price of oil 
rose after Iran warned the presence of US forces in the Gulf was causing instability in the region.Meanwhile the 
pound sank against the dollar at the start of a crucial week for Britain with the Supreme Court to decide whether 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted legally in suspending parliament for an extended period as he pushes for Brexit 
on October 31. 'Hot and cold' Stock markets were also buffeted after President Donald Trump ruled out a partial 
trade deal with China, casting fresh doubt on any early agreement."Investors remain unconvinced that a trade deal 
is about to see the light of day soon, and that's likely to put a cap on any further gains in risk assets," said Hussein 
Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM."I'm not looking for a partial deal. 
I'm looking for a complete deal," Trump told reporters at the White House.He added that he did not see the need for 
an agreement before the 2020 presidential election.The remarks tempered recent optimism on the talks and the 
possibility of a quick piecemeal deal, though they came as China hailed progress in preparatory discussions ahead 
of a planned high-level meeting next month."The hot and then cold and then hot and cold again US-China trade 
vibes continue to rattle markets," said Rodrigo Catril at National Australia Bank.US stocks were largely flat in late 
morning trading. Key figures around 1530 GMT London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.3 percent at 7,326.08 points

Sep 23, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Stock markets 
fell on Monday after President Donald Trump ruled out a partial trade deal with China, casting fresh doubt on any 
early agreement.A key survey pointing to weakness in the eurozone economy also weighed heavily on European 
equity markets, analysts said.Many travel and tourism stocks, meanwhile, were higher after British giant Thomas 
Cook went bankrupt.The price of oil steadied after Iran warned the presence of US forces in the Gulf was causing 
instability in the region. "Two major factors that remained unresolved are trade disputes and rising tensions in the 
Middle East," said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. 'Hot and cold' "Investors remain unconvinced 
that a trade deal is about to see the light of day soon, and that's likely to put a cap on any further gains in risk 
assets," he said. 
"The longer it takes to strike a deal, the more economic damage will be felt."Equity markets were also tracking 
comments from Trump saying he wanted to strike a full trade deal with Beijing, knocking back hopes for a 
piecemeal agreement between the economic superpowers."I'm not looking for a partial deal. I'm looking for a 
complete deal," he told reporters at the White House.He added that he did not see the need for an agreement 
before the 2020 presidential election.The remarks tempered recent optimism on the talks, though they came as 
China hailed progress in preparatory discussions ahead of a planned high-level meeting next month."The hot and 
then cold and then hot and cold again US-China trade vibes continue to rattle markets," said Rodrigo Catril at 
National Australia Bank. Thomas Cook fallout Some rivals of British travel giant Thomas Cook which declared 
bankruptcy after last-ditch re-financing attempts failed, saw their shares rise sharply.TUI shares, listed in London, 
were up around seven percent in the late European morning.Ryanair traded one percent higher and easyJet four 
percent, but British Airways parent IAG was lower.In Hong Kong, China's Fosun International lost 1.5 percent after 
the collapse of Thomas Cook, in which it is the top shareholder.On foreign exchange markets the pound sank 
against the dollar at the start of a crucial week for Britain with the Supreme Court to decide whether Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson acted legally in suspending parliament for an extended period as he pushes for Brexit on October 
31.Meanwhile the euro weakened after data a closely watched survey showed that Brexit and trade war fears drove 
eurozone business growth to its lowest level in six years in September, warning that the single currency area's 
economy was "close to stalling".IHS Markit's composite eurozone PMI, seen as a key indicator of business 
confidence, fell to 50.4 in September, down from 51.9 in August -- the lowest reading since June 2013."The 
eurozone economy almost ground to a halt in September," observed analysts at Oxford Economics. Key figures

       U.K. stocks were moving lower on Monday, with banks and miners pacing the decliners, as investors awaited 
more clarity on U.S.-China trade talks. 
 U.S. President Donald Trump said he didn't need a trade deal with China before the 2020 election, fueling 
pessimism about the prospect of a trade truce between the world's two largest economies.
 The collapse of Thomas Cook helped lift shares of travel operators and airline companies, helping limit the 
downside to some extent. 
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 46 points, or 0.63 percent, at 7,298 after declining 0.2 percent on Friday. 
 Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore fell 3-4 percent while Lloyds Banking Group lost 2.9 percent, 
Barclays declined 2 percent and HSBC Holdings dropped 1.4 percent. 
 Marks &Spencer; Group shares slumped 4.3 percent. The company announced that Humphrey Singer, Group 
Chief Financial Officer, has decided to leave the business and a succession process is now underway.
 TUI jumped 6.6 percent, EasyJet rallied 4.2 percent and Ryanair Holdings advanced 1.5 percent on expectations 
that they will benefit from the Thomas Cook bankruptcy.
 AstraZeneca gained 0.7 percent after it secured approval from European Union regulators to market Qtrilmet 
tablets.
 Sports Direct International edged down slightly after it made a possible cash offer of 5 pence per share for the 
entire share capital of Goals Soccer Centres.

Sep 23, 2019( Talking Biz News: http://www.talkingbiznews.com Delivered by Newstex)  UK's tour major Thomas 
Cook stopped trading today after a last-minute push to keep the company going fell through.The BBC had the 
news[1]:Thomas Cook has collapsed after last-minute negotiations aimed at saving the 178-year-old holiday firm 
failed.The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the tour operator had 'ceased trading with immediate effect'.It has 
also triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers 
home.Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's chief executive, said the firm's collapse was a 'matter of profound 
regret'.Commenting as the company entered compulsory liquidation[2], Mr Fankhauser also apologised to the firm's 
'millions of customers, and thousands of employees'.The tour operator's failure puts 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, 
including 9,000 in the UK.CNN's Clare Duffy and Rob McLean reported [3]thousands of holiday-makers were 
stranded abroad as a result of the firm's collapse:There are more than 150,000 UK outbound Thomas Cook 
customers abroad, almost twice the number that were repatriated following the failure of Monarch, according to the 
aviation authority.'When people get to the end of their holiday, they will be brought back to the UK,' Tim Johnson, 
head of policy at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, told CNN.'We've chartered 40 planes and we're going to be 
running over 1,000 flights over the next two weeks,' he added.Repatriation flights are only available for passengers 
whose journey originated in the UK. 
The aviation authority launched a website[4] where customers can find details on those flights.'Customers currently 
overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated 
website,' the aviation authority said in a statement.Depending on where travelers are located, return flights will be 
either on flights operated by the aviation authority or by existing flights with other airlines, according to Thomas 
Cook.For Thomas Cook travelers abroad on holiday packages protected by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence, the 
aviation authority said it will sort out hotel bills[5].ATOL is a UK financial protection program that protects most air 
package holidays sold by UK-based travel businesses.Josephine Mason reported [6]for Reuters that the agency's 
failure had boosted the stocks of competitors:Thomas Cook's (TCG.L[7]) collapse boosted shares in TUI 
(TUIGn.DE[8]) and budget airlines easyJet (EZJ.L[9]) and Ryanair (RYA.I[10]) on Monday as investors pinned 
hopes on the tour operator's closure cutting capacity in the saturated European holiday market.The world's oldest 
travel firm went out of business on Monday, stranding some 600,000 holidaymakers around the globe and sparking 
the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history involving some 150,000 travelers.At 0725 GMT, rival tour 
operator TUI was up as much as 8.4% at its highest since February, easyJet was up 6.1% and Ryanair was 2.6%

higher, the three top gainers on the pan European STOXX 600 index.The FTSE 350 travel and leisure index 
.FTNMX5750 rose to its highest level in almost a year.'Thomas Cook's collapse likely brings bad news for holiday 
makers and UK/German governments, but takes capacity out and likely will boost shares most exposed to its 
markets,' said one dealer.In London, Dart Group (DTG.L[11]) which runs package holiday company Jet2holidays 
was up 8.7% after hitting its highest level since May 21.FTSE small-cap listed On the Beach (OTB.L[12]) was up 
1.6% as hopes it will gain market share offset news the company will book a one-time charge due to the 
collapse.'The removal of Thomas Cook's capacity from the market should be positive for pricing in the short term, 
over the forthcoming winter season,' Liberum analysts said in a note. [ 1]: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-

British-based pilots for Irish budget airline Ryanair have called off a planned five-day strike, the British Airline Pilots 
Association said Friday.
"This comes despite the fact that the relationship between Ryanair and its pilots in the UK and elsewhere remains 
acrimonious. Instead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by 
withdrawing their travel benefits," the association said in a statement.
UK pilot representatives had agreed to suspend any further strikes in order to pave the way for "meaningful 
negotiations under the auspices of the UK conciliation service, ACAS."
"Despite a strong turnout for strike action and a high level of commitment among pilots in Ryanair, the pilot 
representatives took the decision to allow a breathing space in the hope that constructive negotiations could get 
underway," the statement added.
The pilots association said it retained the ability to set new strike dates should it be necessary.
Strikes were due to be held on September 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29.
British-based Ryanair pilots launched strike action last month due to disagreements over pay structure, pensions, 
license insurance and other benefits.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
this year's summer holiday season in August and September.

strike
BA to restore half of flights next Friday; Airlines ; Carrier tells customers 
they can rebook after pilots call off strike

British Airways will operate around half of its flights next Friday after its pilots announced they would no longer 
strike on September 27.
The airline said customers whose flights were scrapped due to next week's planned industrial action will have the 
option to rebook on to a BA flight.
The news comes two days after the British Airline Pilots' Association, which represents the majority of BA's pilots, 
cancelled next week's strike action and called on the airline to restart talks to end one of the most serious industrial 
disputes in its history.
But the decision will come at a cost for BA as it had already cancelled most of its 800 flights for September 27, and 
dozens either side of the strike date.
A 48-hour walkout by pilots earlier this month cost BA an estimated £40m a day after it was forced to cancel almost 
1,700 flights, hitting 195,000 customers.
BA contacted passengers on September 12 to confirm cancellations, 15 days ahead of the strike date. Under EU 
law, this means that passengers are only entitled to a new flight or a refund. If BA had given 14 days or less notice, 
it would have been liable for additional compensation payments.
BA to restore half of flights next Friday Airlines ; Carrier tells customers they can rebook after pilots call off 
strike
Most of BA's customers are now likely to have rearranged their plans, either by booking a new flight with the airline 
or one of its partners or by getting a refund and rebooking elsewhere.
BA said: "We are offering all customers whose flights were cancelled due to next week's planned industrial action 
the option to rebook on to a British Airways flight, with a schedule of services to our daily destinations on 
September 26, 27 and 28."
Passengers who opted for a refund should be able to rebook at their original fare, as well as those customers that 
chose to be moved to another airline by BA. However, passengers who decided to book their own travel will not be 
given their money back if they end up choosing to fly with BA.
On Wednesday, Balpa said calling off the strike was a "genuine attempt at establishing a timeout for common 
sense to prevail".
However, the union warned that should BA refuse "meaningful new negotiations", it retained the right to announce 
further strike dates. It has a mandate for strike action until January.
BA declined to comment on whether it planned to restart talks with Balpa.
In a separate industrial dispute, Balpa yesterday cancelled five further days of strike action at Ryanair - saying it 
also wanted to pave the way for meaningful negotiations through Acas, the conciliation service. Its Ryanair pilots 
have already walked out for seven days in August and September. The low-cost airline was still able to run its 
normal operating schedule by flying in pilots from other bases around Europe.

Ryanair shareholders protest against potential bonus of (EURO)99m for O'Leary

Ryanair investors have registered a big protest vote against the pay of longserving chief executive Michael O'Leary 
after he was granted a bonus that could be worth nearly (EURO)100m. Almost half of the airline's investors 
yesterday failed to back the company's remuneration plans, which received support from only 50.5 per cent.
The protest at Ryanair's shareholder meeting was sparked by a February decision to grant Mr O'Leary options for 
10m shares, which would pay out (EURO)99m if profits hit (EURO)2bn or its share price rose above (EURO)21 in 
the next five years.
The vote was non-binding but represented the most significant protest yet against pay at Ryanair, which has a 
history of investor discontent on the issue. Mr O'Leary said: "We're disappointed that the vote wasn't higher. But I 
think we have to take on board shareholder concerns in the next 12 months and you'll see that happen."
The chief executive nonetheless defended the share options by arguing that they aligned his interests with 
shareholders. "I don't think there's any investor in that room ... that would begrudge a large number of share options 
if I doubled their investment in the next five years," he said.
"If I don't do it over the next five years, you don't pay me anything at all."
Ryanair shareholders protest against potential bonus of (EURO)99m for O'Leary
One top 20 investor told the Financial Times it had voted against the remuneration report because of "transparency 
issues", adding there was "no compelling justification" for the options. Another shareholder, Jocelyn Brown, senior 
investment manager at the UK railways pension scheme, said the share options plan "raises a red flag for us".
"We appreciate Mr O'Leary's role in the success of Ryanair but a potential payout of over (EURO)100m is hard to 
support," she said.
The vote comes at a difficult time for Ryanair, which is facing staff strikes almost two years after it agreed to 
recognise unions following a rostering failure that led to thousands of flight cancellations.

RYANAIR suffered an investor revolt yesterday after half of shareholders voted against a bonus scheme for boss 
Michael O'Leary that could see him earn (EURO)100m (£88.56m) over five years.
The budget carrier said 50.5 per cent of the airline's shareholders voted for its remuneration report, in which 
Ryanair was seeking approval for a new long-term incentive plan for senior managers.
Under the new deal, O'Leary's pay and the maximum annual bonus have both been cut in half to (EURO)500,000, 
but he was also granted 10m share options.
Nearly a quarter of investors also voted against the re-election of chairman David Bonderman, who suffered a 
similar backlash last September following the airline's summer strikes. Other bosses who felt investors' fire were 
non-executive directors Michael Cawley, Kyran McLaughlin and Howard Millar.
Ryanair said in a statement: "Ryanair is, and will continue to, consult with its shareholders, and we will report back 
to them over the coming year on how the board will adapt its decision making to reflect their advice and input on all 
these topics." Ryanair said O'Leary's pay was "considerably lower" than many other European airline bosses and 
less than he received in 2016, 2017 and 2019.
Ryanair shares dropped in afternoon trading, before recovering to close up 0.3 per cent.
"This level of investor dissent should have come as no surprise to the board of Ryanair," said investor Royal 
London Asset Management. "It is encouraging that a significant proportion of the company's shareholders have 
exercised their voting power to try and address the governance issues which continue to affect the company."
Turbulence for O'Leary after Ryanair pay row
In February, it said the share option grant was "wholly inappropriate".
"Asking shareholders to pay directors more than (EURO)100m for achieving a marginal improvement over its share 
price high in August 2017 is ludicrous," it said at the time.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary calls a (EURO)99m bonus if he doubles the share price "a free bet" for investors. But 
half of them refused to back it. Do they not realise how generous he's being? It's surely the first time the airline - 
which charges (EURO)20 to print a boarding pass - has offered anything for free.

RYANAIR expects the grounded Boeing 737 Max jet will be back in Britain's skies by the beginning of March 2020, 
despite misgivings about such a timetable in Europe.
At the budget flyer's annual shareholder meeting, chief executive Michael O'Leary told shareholders he expects the 
jet, which was grounded worldwide in March this year after the second of two crashes which killed a total of 346 
people.
His statement comes despite Europe's aviation regulator insisting on carrying out its own certification process on 
the plane, rather than trusting that of its US counterpart.
The European Aviation Safety Agency will likely run these tests after the US Federal Aviation Agency has passed 
the plane as safe to fly again, which is unlikely to happen until late this year and could be delayed further.
"If it flies in North America this side of Christmas, I think we are pretty secure we will be back flying some time 
[around] end of February or March," O'Leary said.
However, this would depend on Boeing getting approval in the US at around the end of November, he added.

Sep 20, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[2] is expected to start flying the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft next February or early March. The 
company's CEO Michael O'Leary stated, "If it flies in North America this side of Christmas, I think we are pretty 
secure we will be back flying some time (around) end-February/March". Meanwhile, he believes, "The best outlook 
is the first aircraft would come in January. The more realistic outcome: the end of February/March".Before the 
aircraft is certified fit to fly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is required to give its nod on the proposed 
software and training changes by Boeing. Following FAA's review, the aircraft needs to be approved by the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Meanwhile, Ryanair's MAX200 plane needs to be approved 
separately.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-
fundamental/price Ryanair Holdings PLC price[3] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[4]Ryanair, being one of Boeing's 
biggest 737 MAX customers with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, has been struggling quite a lot due to 
delivery delays from the aircraft's grounding. 
During fiscal 2020, non-fuel unit costs are projected to inch up 2% due to this headwind among other factors. 
Moreover, with the ongoing grounding issue, the carrier will be flying 30 MAX planes compared with 60 it hoped for 
previously. As a result, the airline trimmed its fiscal 2020 growth forecast to 3% from 7% expected earlier.Thanks to 
the prolonged grounding period, U.S. airlines including the likes of United Airlines UAL[5] and American Airlines 
AAL[6] have suspended the MAX aircraft from their schedules through December. Whereas Southwest Airlines 
LUV[7] has removed the aircraft from its schedule though early January.Ryanair to Lay Off Nearly 700 PilotsDue to 
an excess of 500 pilots, O'Leary announced plans to cut back 700 positions. Meanwhile, the British Airline Pilots 
Association (BALPA) accused the company's management of threatening pilots "with the removal of staff travel 
benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary" in case they participate in strikes.However, O'Leary 
denied such allegations saying "it is illegal to blacklist someone for being involved" in trade unions. He further 
added that "it has never happened, but we have been accused of it for around 30 years now."Amid the 
controversies, O'Leary received some encouraging news as Ryanair shareholders approved a bonus scheme that 
could fetch him 100 million euros in five years in case he is able to either double the company's profitability or its 
share price within the time frame. It remains to be seen whether O'Leary succeeds in receiving this massive bonus 
amount given that the company struggles with both the Boeing MAX groundings and persistent labor strife, which 
have significantly hampered the company's operations.Zacks Rank Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You

Ryanair 's O'Leary wins bonus approval as pilots face axe
Ryanair's O'Leary wins bonus approval as pilots face axe
Business World (Digest)

Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary narrowly secured approval from shareholders on Thursday for a bonus 
scheme that could earn him 100 million euros over five years as he revealed up to 700 pilots could lose their jobs.
The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, has been battered by industrial disputes and the grounding of Boeing's 
flagship 737 MAX.
Having suffered from a shortage of pilots just a couple of years ago, O'Leary told investors there are now too many. 
He forecast the company would cut between 500 and 700 pilots as a sharp decrease in demand has seen the 
natural attrition rate collapse.
To earn his 100 million euro bonus, O'Leary would need to reverse a near-50% fall in the company's share price 
since 2017. The share price hit a peak of 19.39 euros in August 2017 but was down 1.8 percent at 9.76 euros at 
1330 GMT on Thursday.
O'Leary secured the backing of 50.5% of shareholders for the scheme which will grant him 10 million share options 
if he doubles Ryanair's profitability to 2 billion euros per annum and/or increase the share price to 21 euros per 
share.
The size of the award "raises a red flag in terms of quantum and for our members," said Jocelyn Brown of the UK 
Railway pension scheme, which voted against the deal.
O'Leary said he was disappointed by the level of support and said he would take on investor concerns.
Ryanair 's O'Leary wins bonus approval as pilots face axe
"I think most shareholders would take the view that if he doubles the share price, we don't care what you pay him 
for the next five years," he added.
O'Leary pitched to investors his plans to turn around the airline, whose biggest challenges are industrial relations 
disputes and the grounding of the 737 MAX after Ryanair ordered 135 jets with options on 75 more.
He said Ryanair will continue to challenge unions, whose strikes had been "complete failures" and the MAX delays 
would force capacity cutbacks for next summer.
Bases in the United Kingdom and Ireland are likely to suffer cuts, with 10-20 redundancies from 400 pilots at the 
airline's home base in Dublin. The firm has about 17,000 employees across Europe.
"We are looking at voluntary (redundancies), but ultimately we will move from voluntary to compulsory very quickly," 
he said, adding that pilots had already been offered 12-month unpaid leave.
As O'Leary spoke the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) accused management of threatening pilots who 
take part in strike action "with the removal of staff travel benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from 
salary."
The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations said Ryanair pilot representatives were "being singled 
out for threatening and intimidating behaviour" and that Irish company council representatives were being sued by 
Ryanair.
Ryanair, which recognised trade unions for the first time two years ago, denied any union members were being 
targeted in any way for their union activities.
"It is illegal to blacklist someone for being involved" in trade unions, he said. "It has never happened, but we have 
been accused of it for around 30 years now." (Reuters)

Ryanair boss expects Boeing 737 MAX delays to further disrupt growth
Ryanair boss expects Boeing 737 MAX delays to further disrupt growth

Body
The head of Ryanair said he fears that the budget airline's growth plans will be further disrupted by delays in 
deliveries of aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing, which is still grappling with its 737 MAX planes being banned 
from the air.
Boeing 's 737 MAX series was grounded in March after two crashes involving the MAX 8 variants, one in March in 
Ethiopia that killed 157 people and another in Indonesia in October that killed 189.
The cause of the crashes appears to be linked to a software malfunction.
The delivery of planes ordered by Ryanair could be delayed into 2020, said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary at the 
annual general meeting of the flight company on Thursday in Dublin.
Ryanair might not receive the first aircraft in the delivery until March or April, O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair has 
stopped its payments to Boeing and is in negotiations with the US manufacturer to receive compensation.
Ryanair will have to curb its growth plans even further if there are extended delays, O'Leary said.
The Irish airline has a contract with Boeing to order up to 210 of its Boeing 737s, including MAX models.
O'Leary already announced plans to tone down the company's growth strategy in response to the Boeing MAX 
crisis and Britain's imminent exit from the European Union. The company is also dealing with potential strike action 
from pilots in Britain and Spain.
He also talked about job cuts mentioned earlier this year. Around 500 to 700 roles are expected to be slashed.

Highlight: CorporaciÃ³n AmÃ©rica Airports has reported preliminary year-over-year passenger traffic growth of 
1.6% in August 2019.
Body
Passenger Traffic Overview Total passenger traffic in August 2019 increased 1.6% YoY primarily reflecting growth 
of 9.0% in Argentina and 15.0% in Armenia, partially offset by declines in Brazil and Italy. In Argentina, total 
passenger traffic increased 9.0% YoY, driven by growth of 11.0% in domestic passengers as a result of the 
continued good performance of new routes by existing and new airlines introduced during 2018 and 2019, together 
with a mix-shift to domestic from international travel by local passengers, further supported by an increase of 3.6% 
in international passenger traffic, signaling a slight recovery from the recent downward trend. In addition, Air Europa 
started a new flight connecting Iguazú Airport with Madrid, Spain, via Asunción, Paraguay. 
Moreover, Norwegian Air Argentina announced a new domestic route to Ushuaia, starting in September, further 
enhancing connectivity in the country while low-cost carrier Flybondi announced a new international route to Rio de 
Janeiro, Brasil, with three weekly flights, starting in October. In Italy, passenger traffic declined 1.7% YoY, reflecting 
a drop of 3.4% in passenger traffic at Pisa Airport, mainly due to the reduction of operations by Ryanair due to 
adjustments in operational schedules. The suspension of Pobeda's route to Saint Petersburg and lower frequencies 
to Moscow also contributed to lower traffic at Pisa Airport. This was partially offset by growth of 2.4% at Florence 
Airport, reflecting additional flights to Paris, France, by Air France and, to a lesser extent, additional flights to 
Madrid, Spain, by Iberia. In Brazil, estimated figures are disclosed given delays in the submission of information for 
750 flights out of a total of 6,823 flights, due to information systems transition by third parties. Passenger traffic 
declined 14.5%, primarily reflecting the cessation of operations by a Avianca Brasil. Domestic passengers declined 
9.9% while international passengers increased 28.3% according to the new methodology introduced by ANAC. In 
addition, Gol announced additional domestic flights from Natal Airport to Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Brasilia, 
starting in December, while Latam Airlines Brasil announced additional flights from Natal to São Paulo beginning 
November. Moreover, Azul Airlines announced additional frequencies to Viracopos, Campinas, in December. In 
Armenia, total passenger traffic increased 15.0%, benefiting from the addition of several new routes and 
CorporaciÃ³n AmÃ©rica Airports announces 1.6% YoY increase in total passenger traffic in August 2019
frequencies during 2018 and 2019, and also reflecting the increase in flights from Russia to Armenia, given 
Russia's ban on flights to and from Georgia. In Ecuador, total passenger traffic increased 0.2%, with international 
passenger traffic increasing 5.6%, mainly reflecting new flights by Jet Blue and Aeroméxico started earlier this year. 
However, Aeroméxico recently announced that it will discontinue this route starting October 2019. Traffic growth 
was also driven by the new route by Plus Ultra to Madrid, Spain, opened during July 2019. In addition, during 
August low-cost carrier Wingo Airlines started a new flight to Bogotá, Colombia operating from Guayaquil Airport. 
Moreover, Iberia announced a new route to Madrid, Spain, starting in December.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary expects its units of Boeing's (BA) grounded 737 Max aircraft to take flight 
in February or March next year, according to media reports on Thursday, citing the executive at the Irish airline's 
annual general meeting.
"If it flies in North America this side of Christmas, I think we are pretty secure we will be back flying some time 
(around) end-February/March," said O'Leary.
O'Leary added that January is the best case, but unlikely, scenario for the airline's 737 Max aircraft to again 
become operational.
Boeing needs to secure approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for its proposed software and training 
changes. Afterwards, the aircraft will require approval from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.
Ryainair is one of the biggest customers for the 737 Max, with 135 orders and 75 options. If the aircraft fails to 
secure certification, it will be "devastating" for the industry because of the order backlogs at the major aircraft 
manufacturers, according to O'Leary.
"What's our Plan B? We don't have a Plan B," said O'Leary.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) is planning to eliminate between 500 to 700 jobs amid an ongoing row with pilots over 
pay and work conditions, media reported.
Speaking at the Irish budget carrier's annual general meeting on Thursday, CEO Michael O'Leary said that the 
company currently has a surplus of 500 pilots and that the job cuts could affect employees at its Dublin base.
The announcement comes after shareholders narrowly approved a bonus scheme for O'Leary that could earn him 
as much as EUR100 million ($111 million) in the next five years, according to reports. The arrangement calls for 
O'Leary to increase the airline company's profitability by twofold in the same five-year period.
Shareholders also voted against the re-installation of Chairman David Bonderman, according to reports.

The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said on Thursday that Ryanair pilots in the UK have been told by the 
airline that their benefits will be removed should they take part in strike action started on Wednesday.
Ryanair members of pilots union BALPA announced a further seven days of strikes earlier this month, after their 
latest walkout came to an end, having caused little disruption for the low-cost airline.
Widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, hitting its 
profits in the busy summer months. But a series of strikes in Britain, Spain and Portugal in recent weeks has 
caused minimal disruption.
BALPA members had planned to walk out again on Sept. 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29. Some of these strikes 
coincide with multi-day strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Spain.
The association said on Thursday that it still hopes to meet with Ryanair on Friday or the coming Monday, although 
they still have not heard from the airline. (Reuters)

Sep 18, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  The British 
Airlines Pilots' Association said Wednesday it is calling off its scheduled Sept. 27 strike against British Airways, 
saying pilots have decided to take the "responsible course.""Someone hasto take the initiative to sort out this 
dispute and with no sign of that from BA the pilots have decided to take the responsible course," association 
General Secretary Brian Sutton said. 
[1]"In a genuine attempt at establishing a time out for common sense to prevail, we have lifted the threat of a strike 
on the 27th of September."British Airways has already canceled some Sept. 27 flights, taking a revenue hit. The 
pilots associationwarned of a strike in the futureif the company refuses to engage in "meaningful negotiation."Last 
week, a two-day strike by British Airways pilots resulted in the airline canceling nearly all of its flights.The pilots are 
seeking a pay increase of 11.5%, saying even thatwas not enough given BA's financial success. The airline has 
said it is "considering the implications and will give updates in due course."Another major European airline that has 
seen strikes this year is low-cost carrier Ryanair.Ryanair pilots walked off the jobAug. 22-23, and have planned 
another walkout for Wednesday and Thursday.Pilotsare set to strike five more days this month, but Ryanair 
leadership saidflights will take off as expected.The strikes at Ryanair are over working conditions and pay.Sutton 
hassaid Ryanair[2] "should stop dragging its feet and get back to the negotiating table."According to EU regulation 
261/2004[3], customers are entitled to compensation if their flights are cancelled without 14-days notice. The 
amount of compensation is based on the distance of the flight. [ 1]: https://news.sky.com/story/british-airways-pilots-

Sep 18, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Passengers 
have criticized Spanish low-cost airline Vueling for the way its staff dealt with an evacuation process after a flight 
from Malagato Barcelonamade an emergency landing Friday due to smoke in the aircraft.Smoke was noticed in the 
aircraft about 20 minutes before the landing. Passengers said no safety masks were handed out and at one point, 
the staff told them to "cover your nostrils with your hands and lower your head to your legs."Though the flight 
landed safely, the evacuation was delayed as the emergency chute did not remain still due to the strong winds. 
Finally, extra personnel were brought in to hold the chute down following which all the passengers were evacuated 
safely. Some passengers also helped in holding the chute so the co-travelers could get off safely.'Several people 
suffered panic attacks, especially when the plane had landed, emergency ramps were not activated and there was 
a high concentration of smoke in the cabin which made it difficult to breathe," Javier Calderón, a passenger, told 
local media. [1]He added that they were very nervous and weren't informed about what was going on. Calderón 
said two Ryanair staff, who were traveling on the same flight, helped the Vueling crew in the evacuation.A videoof 
the incident posted on social media showed smoke-filled cabin with passengers sitting still in their seats. Another 
video showed the passengers sliding down the chutes one at a time.In a statement, the airline said, "Vueling is 
investigating the incident with the competent authorities to determine the causes. All customers were evacuated 
safely."

Sep 17, 2019( MarketersMedia News Hub: http://marketersmedia.com/news-hub Delivered by Newstex)  Global 
online travel market is expected to grow from USD 570.25 billion in 2017 to USD 1,134.55 billion by 2023 and 
Online Travel Market Report: By Platform Type (Mobile/Tablets Based, Desktop Based) Mode of Booking (Online 
Travel Agencies, Direct Travel Facilitators)Pune, India - September 17, 2019 /MarketersMedia/ — Online Travel 
Market Highlights:The global online travel market was valued at USD 570.25 billion in 2017, and by 2023, it could 
touch a valuation of USD 1,134.55 billion, reveals Market Research Future (MRFR). MRFR adds that the market is 
projected to attain a CAGR of 13.16% during the forecast period (2017-2023).  The global online travel market 
benefits primarily from the soaring customer demand in emerging and developed nations for international tours. The 
market is also lucratively shaped by the increasing trend of travel service sellers that strive to reach the customers 
directly. This prompts several travel agencies to branch out in other areas, which could elevate the growth trajectory 
of the online travel market in subsequent years. Social media platforms have emerged as a prominent marketing 
opportunity for online travel companies in recent years. 
Given the large-scale use of social media by consumers, their preferences and interests are easily tracked which 
helps travel companies to target those that are likely to opt for travel experiences and who can also afford travel 
packages. These factors offer online travel companies a highly comprehensive insight into customer wants and 
behavior. Another major trend making its way into the Online Travel Market[1] is the rising preference among travel 
companies to provide various other services including food and shopping experiences. With the increasing focus of 
primary suppliers like railway and airlines authorities on reaching out directly to customers, online travel companies 
are expected to expand in other areas to engage customers. Apart from this, growing use of apps, as well as online 
shopping portals by key suppliers of transportation options, could elevate the market position in the near future. 
Citing a reference, in April 2019, a renowned online travel agency in Southeast Asia named Traveloka started 
providing entry to spas, hotels, and movie theaters. This move was mirrored by numerous companies around the 
world, depicting the popularity of such aspects in the transportation sector. Request a Free Sample @ 
https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/sample_request/5182[2]; Top Companies:The top players in the worldwide 
online travel market include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (China), TripAdvisor Inc. (US), Thomas Cook Group 
PLC (UK), Expedia Inc. (US), MakeMyTrip (India) Pvt. Ltd (India), Ryanair DAC (Ireland), eDreams ODIGEO SA

(Luxembourg), Airbnb Inc. (US), Ctrip.com International Ltd (China), Booking Holdings Inc. (US), FlixMobility GmbH 
(Germany), among others. Few other companies enlisted in the MRFR report are Hays Travel limited (UK), Yatra 
Online Private Limited (India), CheapOair.Com (US), AirGorilla, LLC (California), Hotel Urbano Travel and Tourism 
SA (Brazil), Tuniu Corporation (China), Hostelworld Group (Ireland), to name a few. Market Segmentation:The 
worldwide online travel market has been split into platform type, mode of booking, and service type.  The types of 
platforms are mobile/tablets-based and desktop-based platform.With respect to the mode of booking, the segments 
covered by the report are online travel agencies and direct travel facilitators.  With context to the service type, the 
market includes accommodation, transportation, and vacation packages. The transportation segment consists of air 
travel, train travel, bus travel, and others. The accommodation segment can be divided into hotels and guest 
house/dormitory, while the vacation packages segment has been considered for in-country and outside country. 
Regional Analysis:The online travel market is mainly concentrated in the regions of Europe, North America, Asia 
Pacific (APAC), Middle East and Africa (MEA) and South America. In 2017, North America was identified as the 
leading market for online travel with a share of 34%. The market value in the region was estimated at USD 192.46 
billion the same year. Europe was the second-largest market for online travel in 2017 and could achieve a CAGR of 
12.0% in the given timeframe. However, the online travel market in Asia Pacific is touted to record the highest 
CAGR of 15.9% from 2017 to 2023. North America is hailed as the top online travel market, on account of soaring 
demand for customer relationship management (CRM) solutions for personalizing the services that meet with 
certain needs of travel and hospitality companies. In the United States (US), the travel and tourism industry does 
not come under any single entity such as tourism ministry or bureau. Instead, the industry is incorporated into 
several federal agencies that are part of the government. Travel agencies based in Canada are now focusing on 
accelerating online travel sales. The regional market also benefits from the boost in adoption of mobile booking 
technology as well as travel apps.  Increasing inbound tourism along with international investments, could work in 
favor of the online travel market in Europe. In addition, a variety of offers on travel packages provided by many 
companies are attracting more customers, which gives way to fierce competition among suppliers.  The increasing 
use of the Internet coupled with the emergence of low-cost carriers are expected to contribute immensely to the 
online travel market in APAC. Proliferation of mobile devices combined with technology-driven tools and platforms 
has changed the dynamics of the travel industry in the region.  The MEA and South America markets can depict 
significant growth during the review period, given the stupendous boom in the tourism industry. Also, increasing 
number of affluent consumers opting for ambitious travel options in the region is estimated to help the market make 
massive 
revenues 
in 
the 
near 
future.

Sep 14, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Saul Loeb/AFP The 
Boeing 737 was first imagined in 1964, and made its maiden voyage in 1967. In the 55 years since, more than 10 
variants of the 737 have flown, and it's become the best-selling commercial airplane of all-time. Following two fatal 
crashes of the latest model — the 737 Max, caused by a design flaw — we look back at the history of the venerable 
jetliner. As Boeing works to get the grounded 737 Max back in the air, here's a look at the last 55 years of the 737. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The Boeing 737 has been in the news a lot lately, since two 
fatal crashes involving the latest model of the plane, the 737 Max. 
But even though the Max has been grounded for six months, as Boeing works to fix a dangerous flaw in the 
troubled jet, the sky has continued to be crisscrossed by older models of the 737. In fact, if you've taken a domestic 
commercial flight in the past 50 years — including the last six months — there's a very good chance you were on a 
737 of some sort. That's because Boeing has sold a ton of them. As of August 2019, the planemaker has taken 
orders for 15,155 of them since 1965, when the jetliner was first unveiled. It delivered the 10,000th of these in April 
2018, a (currently-grounded) 737 Max 8 to Southwest Airlines. Despite the missteps and tragic consequences 
surrounding the Max's initial design, the larger 737 family has proved itself as a faithful workhorse for airlines 
around the world, ranging from long-haul carriers like Delta that include the plane as a small part of its fleet, to low-
cost airlines like Ryanair, which uses 737s for its entire fleet. Although the 737 looks likely to fly on for years to 
come, well past its 70th birthday, Boeing will need to prove to its customers that it's fixed the flawed Max and that 
it's learned enough from the episode to prevent it from ever happening again. The rival Airbus A320 family is 
nipping at its heels, with 14,789 orders through August. With Boeing failing to sell a single Max[2]for more than five 
months, as customers wait to see how the company fixes the plane, the need to restore consumer confidence is 
urgent. Here's a closer look at the incredible 54-year history of the Boeing 737. Early design work began on the 
narrow-body 737 in 1964. Boeing was looking to design a 50-60 seat aircraft designed for trips between 50-1,000 
miles. It would be about half the size of Boeing's smallest jet, the 727, which flew up to 1,700 miles. Reuters/Mike 
Segar The plane would be comparable to the Douglas DC-9 (below) and the British Airways Corporation BAC-111. 
AP While the initial design featured a T-tail like the 727 with engines mounted on the fuselage, the lead engineer 
put them on the wings instead, which meant the body could be widened to seat six people across. Thus, the 737-
100 was born. Boeing See the rest of the story at Business Insider[3] See Also: Viking Cruises is trying to set a

ship it's using looks like.[4]Trump's trade war with China is threatening Boeing's crucial sales of larger aircraft,

Wow Air's upbeat relaunch plans come at a tough time for the airline industry
Wow Air's upbeat relaunch plans come at a tough time for the airline 
industry

Highlight: The airline industry has witnessed numerous setbacks recently with strikes, bankruptcies, and the 
grounding of the highly anticipated Boeing 737 MAX aircraft following two fatal crashes.
Body
It, therefore, comes as a surprise that the new owners of WOW Air plan to relaunch flights as early as October this 
year. The Icelandic budget carrier had ceased operations in March and a relaunch was reportedly cancelled at the 
end of July because its US investor failed to pay. However, in the latest development, flights between Keflavik 
Airport in Reykjavik and Washington Dulles International Airport may take place imminently. 
The hope is that by relaunching in October Wow Air will benefit from the winter holiday season. However, US 
citizens are usually more likely to seek sunny destinations in winter months, if they even venture outside of the 
country at all, so this timing could backfire. Iceland's tourism boom has peakedÂ  Iceland has experienced a boom 
in visitors in recent years, driven by Instagram and the medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones. So 
successful has been its tourism industry that the sector is currently addressing issues to do with overtourism. 
According to GlobalData, international arrivals into Iceland increased at a combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
24.6% between 2014 and 2018, offering a great opportunity for Icelandic airlines in this period.Â Â  Unfortunately, 
Wow Air did not survive the Nordic island nation's heyday as a must-visit destination and was declared bankrupt 
earlier this year, so it may prove foolish to relaunch just as Iceland's boomtime is slowing. Iceland is unlikely to 
repeat the successes of recent years. The country is a bucket-list destination that, despite its natural beauty, is not 
a destination suited to regular return trips because of its relative isolation, extreme temperatures and high cost of 
living.Â  Even though Iceland has notable options for skiing, European travellers are more likely to opt for France 
and Italy as destinations, while North American travellers tend to favour Colorado, Montana or Canada. Uganda 
Airlines back in the skies Wow Air is not the only airline attempting a comeback: Uganda Airlines has reinstated 
commercial flights after 18 years. The difference is that this move has been met with positivity instead of doubts. Air 
traffic in Africa is forecasted to grow twice as quickly compared to the mature markets, so while the airline will face 
competition from airlines in Ethiopia, Rwanda and Tanzania, the African continent is seen as offering more 
opportunities and having greater growth potential than in the crowded European market. The airline industry is a 
Wow Air's upbeat relaunch plans come at a tough time for the airline industry
tricky one to manage in the present climate, especially in Europe with Ryanair and EasyJet dominating the low-cost 
segment. What is clear is that, to achieve its goals Wow Air will need to overcome some significant obstacles.Â Â

'Travalyst' challenges tourism operators to make travel greener
'Travalyst' challenges tourism operators to make travel greener
MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)

Length: 565 words
Highlight: The launch of Travalyst by Prince Harry's charitable foundation has been described as a global 
sustainable travel initiative that seeks to 'change the impact of travel, for good'.
Body
But the fear among tourism-related partners is that a failure to get involved with its ethos or to become more 
sustainability-focused, may result in a loss of credibility and missing out on future gains. The fear of being named 
and shamed by the public also looms large. The initiative by Sussex Royal is being done in collaboration with Ctrip, 
Skyscanner, Booking.com, TripAdvisor and Visa. 
The environment, sustainability and overtourismThe initiative comes at a time when the environment and 
environmentalists are in the limelight be it though levelling charges of flight-shaming, or flygskam, across Europe (of 
which not even the Prince of Sussex has found himself exempt) or through the actions of the international protest 
movement Extinction Rebellion. By lending his support to protecting the environment and helping to asist 
communities negatively affected by the tourist industry, the backers of Travalyst are hoping to tap into sustainable 
initiatives that have become a social norm. These operators are betting that rather than solely factoring in 
affordability in their choice of a holiday destination, future travellers will increasingly seek tourism companies with a 
good environmental record. In turn, tourism operators are looking to adopt sustainable measures to reduce their 
environmental impact and appeal to eco-minded travellers. ABTA, a UK travel trade association, recently 
highlighted that 45% of people surveyed said that sustainability is an important element when booking a holiday. 
Over a third of travellers (36%) said they would choose one company over another due to its environmental track 
record. GlobalData's consumer survey of Q4 2018 discovered that eco-tourism holidays are one of the least 
common holiday types across all generations. Despite this, environmental concerns are becoming ever more 
publicised. Alongside this trend is the growing political activism of the 'Greta Thunberg' generation, as Travel 
Weekly puts it, so it is increasingly likely the number of travellers influenced by environmental standards will 
continue to rise. Indeed, more and more tour operators are capitalising on providing authentic experiences for 
travellers that support the local community. These include G Adventures and Intrepid Travel. Major hospitality 
players are increasingly focussing on waste management, such as Hilton Hotels & Resorts ending the use of single-
use plastics, while others plan to ban the use of plastic straws later in 2019. Big airline carriers such as Ryanair and 
'Travalyst' challenges tourism operators to make travel greener
American Airlines have also ventured to end single-use plastics on flights, alongside a phasing out of plastic straws. 
Lack of clear strategies may deter operatorsDespite its merits, the launch of the Travalyst is a daunting prospect for 
co-operators as its objectives seem broad and may involve hidden costs. The lack of insight into how exactly the 
initiative will operate may be a key deterrent for some travel businesses. Currently, all companies involved with 
Travalyst are not core service providers but technology-based companies. Destinations, attractions, transport, 
hotels and airlines are still yet to join the foundation. As millennials and Generation-Z begin to join the workforce, 
tourism-related companies are likely to take further steps to minimise their global environmental impacts, whether 
with Travalyst or by forming alternative initiatives themselves.

Pilots who are striking at British Airways are better paid than at their budget rivals but appear to be less well 
remunerated than their main European competitors, according to a Financial Times analysis.
A starting basic salary for a BA captain is about £75,000, according to Balpa, the pilots' union. BA said the average 
salary for a captain was £167,000, with £16,000 of flight allowances on top of this. The airline has claimed the pay 
rise it has offered would take average captain salaries to more than £200,000.
In comparison, the starting salary for captains at German rival Lufthansa is (EURO)144,000, which rises to 
(EURO)170,000 with additional flight hours and profit sharing. Top-level captains earn a fixed salary of about 
(EURO)240,000, rising to (EURO)285,000 with the additional pay benefits.
At Air France, the average salary for long-haul captains is (EURO)230,000, which does not include benefits, 
bonuses or profit www.shares.UK budget carrier easyJet said its UK captains earned an average of £120,000 and a 
maximum of £145,000. Ryanair's pilots can receive up to £170,000, according to the low-cost airline.
BA caught in pay storm over profit sharing Airlines. Legacy carriers ; Union points to higher rates at some 
rivals, but comparing contracts is not always easy
Sector commentators said pilot pay was difficult to compare across airlines. Pay varied depending on the seniority 
of the pilot, but airlines also offered different bonuses on top of fixed salaries, such as flight allowances, food and 
housing, and profit-share schemes.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at HSBC, said: "The devil is in the detail, and there's really a lot of detail 
because pilot contract structures are a science in themselves. Plus there's the exchange rate to factor in."
At the centre of the dispute is the demand for a profit-share scheme. Pilots are disgruntled that comparable carriers 
such as Lufthansa, Air France and KLM give a proportion of profit to pilots.
A BA captain with the airline for more than a decade said pilots were frustrated that they had taken cuts to help the 
business "rebuild" after the downturn but were not sharing in its recovery. In 2009 BA suffered losses of £400m and 
faced a drop in demand for air travel because of the recession. Now it is making money again - with an operating 
profit of (EURO)2.7bn last year - and pilots want a slice.
Another pilot said: "I've flown with other airlines, and the most unhappy employees I've flown with are at BA. Many 
of the older pilots are very upset. They've had new rostering systems ... given up [holiday] leave, and seen a lot of 
change."
The BA captain described it as "enraging" that the group was unwilling to share profits, calling it "corporate greed". 
He said: "I think our hand has been forced. The underlying issues have been building for quite a few years."
Balpa, alongside the Unite and GMB unions that represent the rest of BA staff, said it had asked for a profit share 
scheme that would result in 7 per cent of operating profit going to workers. Brian Strutton, general secretary, said 
other European airlines had schemes that were much more generous. Profit-sharing is also common at big US 
airlines. BA has offered a rise of 11.5 per cent plus a 1 per cent bonus, an offer that the other unions representing 
ground staff, cabin crew and engineers accepted.
Several industry analysts said it was fair for BA pilots to ask for a share of profits. "Profit-sharing aligns labour 
interests with shareholders," Mr Lobbenberg said. "For airlines, operating in a cyclical industry, it also offers a form 
of cushioning against downturns. US carriers have embraced this concept, as they increased pay for pilots after the 
salary reductions applied in Chapter 11 [bankruptcy protection] during the financial crisis."
Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy, said airline staff had been "patient" as carriers had gone 
"through massive restructuring" over the past decade. "It wouldn't be seen as inappropriate that some of the profit is 
shared. It's certainly true that airlines have to be ferocious on costs at all times. The margins are so tiny.
"On the other hand, failing to operate for the last two days isn't good for the bottom line either."
BA appears to be standing firm. It said it believed its pilot salaries were "competitive, and on average we receive 
five applications from pilots working for competitor airlines for every pilot position at British Airways." It also noted 
that 42 per cent of Balpa members joined BA after the 2008 crash, so "they did not make any financial sacrifices. 
Since then, the aviation industry has become ever more globally competitive.
"We have had to make some difficult decisions to create the strong financial platform we now have, and which 
provides stability for our entire workforce, including pilots."
John Strickland, aviation consultant, said that while BA was a strong performer for parent IAG, there were 
uncertainties such as Brexit, intense competition, and an order book that means it must keep strict control on costs. 
"People look at airlines like BA and look at them being profitable, but in the airline industry, business can be quickly 
hit by unexpected events or downturns. The airlines that make it have cash in the bank to see it through."
Monopolies Virgin calls for Heathrow take-off reform Virgin Atlantic has stepped up calls on the government to 
reform the way takeoff and landing slots are allocated at an expanded Heathrow, with a report highlighting the lack 
of competition on some routes out of the UK's biggest airport.
BA caught in pay storm over profit sharing Airlines. Legacy carriers ; Union points to higher rates at some 
rivals, but comparing contracts is not always easy
The study by WPI Economics, commissioned by Virgin, found around one in four passengers flying from Heathrow 
only had the option to fly with International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, which this week saw almost 
all of its BA flights grounded in a 48-hour pilot walkout.
The report estimates that IAG operated 77 monopoly routes out of Heathrow this summer.
IAG is Heathrow's biggest customer, operating more than half of all take-off and landing slots. The next largest 
groups are Lufthansa with 8 per cent and Virgin Atlantic/Delta with 7 per cent, according to the report.
Virgin has been campaigning for a change to the way slots are allocated to ensure there is more competition when 
Heathrow expands with a third runway.
The UK government is expected to publish its aviation strategy white paper this year, which should include 
proposals for the reform of the slot allocation process.
"Expansion provides an opportunity to totally rethink how we allocate take off and landing slots to enable the 
creation of a second flag carrier that can compete," said Matthew Lesh of the Adam Smith Institute. "Consumers 
need competition to ensure that disruption to one airline doesn't destroy travel plans."
Virgin said that it was "essential" that Heathrow expansion led to "effective competition that delivers for the whole 
nation and this simply cannot be achieved by the continued dominance of one airline group".
However, IAG said that Virgin had had the opportunity over the past two decades to increase its slot share at 
Heathrow by buying slots on the secondary market. Tanya Powley

hit by unexpected events or downturns. The airlines that make it have cash in the bank to see it through."
Monopolies Virgin calls for Heathrow take-off reform Virgin Atlantic has stepped up calls on the government to 
reform the way takeoff and landing slots are allocated at an expanded Heathrow, with a report highlighting the lack 
of competition on some routes out of the UK's biggest airport.
BA caught in pay storm over profit sharing Airlines. Legacy carriers ; Union points to higher rates at some 
rivals, but comparing contracts is not always easy
The study by WPI Economics, commissioned by Virgin, found around one in four passengers flying from Heathrow 
only had the option to fly with International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, which this week saw almost 
all of its BA flights grounded in a 48-hour pilot walkout.
The report estimates that IAG operated 77 monopoly routes out of Heathrow this summer.
IAG is Heathrow's biggest customer, operating more than half of all take-off and landing slots. The next largest 
groups are Lufthansa with 8 per cent and Virgin Atlantic/Delta with 7 per cent, according to the report.
Virgin has been campaigning for a change to the way slots are allocated to ensure there is more competition when 
Heathrow expands with a third runway.
The UK government is expected to publish its aviation strategy white paper this year, which should include 
proposals for the reform of the slot allocation process.
"Expansion provides an opportunity to totally rethink how we allocate take off and landing slots to enable the 
creation of a second flag carrier that can compete," said Matthew Lesh of the Adam Smith Institute. "Consumers 
need competition to ensure that disruption to one airline doesn't destroy travel plans."
Virgin said that it was "essential" that Heathrow expansion led to "effective competition that delivers for the whole 
nation and this simply cannot be achieved by the continued dominance of one airline group".
However, IAG said that Virgin had had the opportunity over the past two decades to increase its slot share at 
Heathrow by buying slots on the secondary market. Tanya Powley

TO FLY. To serve. It may be the tagline of one of the UK's best known brands, but passengers of British Airways 
can be forgiven for grimacing at what has been dished out to them recently. 
In the past two years, BA customers have endured data leaks affecting more than 550,000, an IT meltdown which 
cost the firm £58m, and days of strike action, which this week alone grounded 1,700 flights, left its Heathrow T5 hub 
a ghost town and is costing the airline at least £40m a day. All on top of the usual 'travel chaos' weather events 
which affect all carriers. The brand damage follows BA's much-derided move down-market to scrap free seat 
selection and food and drink on economy shorthaul flights in a cost-cutting drive to compete with budget carriers. 
The budget-busting coincided with Alex Cruz buckling into the chief executive's chair at BA in early 2016, having led 
its sister airline, Vueling, which follows the low-cost model. If anything, the showdown with the well-paid pilots at the 
British Airline Pilots' Association union is all part of a cost-cutting strategy which the airline's parent, International 
Airlines Group (IAG), had demanded. The ensuing stand-off spilling out of mediation, ruining travel plans and 
inflicting even more damage to the airline's dented brand, was less of a certainty, but deemed necessary to reverse 
IAG's share price decline which analysts say was sky-high this time last year based in-part on Cruz's cost control. 
Keeping a handle on pilots' pay will be worth yesterday's share slide in the long-run and is yet another test for Cruz 
who is charged by IAG head office to balance competing with the likes of Emirates on long-haul and Ryanair and 
Easyjet on short-haul routes. It isn't an easy balancing act. While you won't have to search far to find a leisure or 
business passenger who has sworn off the British flag-carrier, City analysts and IAG are keeping the faith that the 
BA boss will continue to deliver profitability (making around £2bn in profits in 2018) for the mothership. Aviation 
analysts agree that the airline's financial performance is somewhat insulated from headline-grabbing mishaps, IT 
underinvestment and a much-diluted brand power. That profit protection is due to a legacy issue from well before 
Cruz's tenure and more permanent than a few PR disasters: Heathrow airport. It's full, but BA has 55 per cent of all 
the landing slots. And BA's London hub remains the airport of choice for its sought-after high-value travellers. The 
No smooth flying for BA with Cruz in control THE CITY VIEW
summer slide of its share and reputation is unwelcome turbulence for the airline - and its customers. This week's 
battle may prove a necessary blip on the radar in the long-haul.

A European airline in a clash with trade unions. A dominating boss. Cabin services cut back. A knack for quickly 
filling the Twittersphere with abuse.
British Airways has begun to resemble low-cost Ryanair. BA's pilots plan to walk out on Monday over pay. 
Additional strikes will follow if the airline does not resume negotiations, their union warned yesterday.
Ryanair, headed by Michael O'Leary, has so far avoided massive disruption from similar recent action by its pilots.
Strikes at BA would be more effective and brand damage greater. Some travellers will curse Willie Walsh, chief 
executive of parent IAG. Its shares, however, should remain among the airline sector's better performers.
For many passengers, BA long ago became Bryanair, an airline charging them more than Ryanair for a service only 
marginally more comfortable. Two weeks ago, some were mistakenly told flights on non-strike days had been 
cancelled. It did not add to the fun. A reputation for IT incompetence followed a power outage two years ago, which 
grounded hundreds of flights.
Shareholders worry how IAG will meet EU ownership rules in a no-deal Brexit. European short-haul travel is also in 
the middle of a price war.
Assuming Brexit fallout is navigated, however, IAG should be among the winners, especially if sector consolidation 
ensues. BA's 2017 technical glitch cost around £75m. A strike bill 10 times that would be only a fifth of last year's 
operating profits.
IAG/British Airways: life of Bryanair
IAG stock has fallen 37 per cent over the past year. Since its creation in early 2011, however, they have delivered 
total returns of 90 per cent. Rival Lufthansa generated 13 per cent.
At four times forward earnings, IAG's shares trade at a multiple barely higher than their five-year low. The 
proportion of analysts with them on "buy" last month reached the highest since the Brexit referendum. Investors 
may follow their recommendations. They do not have to fly on BA, though.

BUDGET airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air both enjoyed an uptick in passenger numbers in August, with the latter 
enjoying a record-breaking month.
Hungary-based Wizz Air has recently announced 23 new routes across Europe, including to Ukraine and Georgia, 
and has also expanded its fleet with two new Airbus 321neo aircraft and two Airbus 321ceo models, taking its entire 
fleet to 119.
Passenger numbers rose to 4.03m as the company passed the 4m monthly mark for the first time.
Wizz's load factor rose 0.7 percentage points to 96.3 per cent.
Ryanair pilots who are members of the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) walked out on 22 August, although 
the airline was able to minimise disruption thanks to the "volunteerism" of its UK pilots.
A strike by the same union is currently underway and is expected to come to an end today.
Ryanair has again said it is operating a normal schedule.
"We do not expect any strikerelated disruptions to our flights to/from our UK airports," said Ryanair.
"On behalf of our customers and their families, we wish to thank all our UK pilots who did not support Balpa's strike 
and have chosen to work to protect the flights and travel plans of our customers and their families."

 Ryanair (RYAAY) continued its flights to and from Britain as scheduled despite the second round of strikes by UK 
pilots over pay and working conditions, according to media reports. 
The three-day strike is aimed at pushing the budget carrier to give members of the British Airline Pilots' Association 
(BALPA) a pay increase and other benefits such as adequate pension and transparent pay structure, according to 
reports Monday. 
The union has accused the airliner of using contractors who are not entitled to join unions to keep its operations 
running. 
BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton reportedly said Ryanair has not given any offer yet.

Sep 03, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1] and United Airlines UAL[2] extended the grounding period of Boeing 737 Max jets in their 
respective fleets. Currently, American Airlines and United Airlines have 24 and 14 such jets, respectively.A couple 
of updates were also available from Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] wholly-owned subsidiary — Alaska Airlines — in the 
past week. The carrier announced the ratifications [4]of two pay-related labor deals and also issued an update 
related to its expansion on the West Coast. An expansion-related update was available from Delta Air Lines DAL[5] 
as well.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] too grabbed headlines by virtue of its decision to 
announce a change at the helm of the group's biggest airline, Ryanair DAC. 
The Irish carrier also announced an 8% increase in its August traffic.(Read the Last Airline Stock Roundup 
here[7]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories1. Updates on Boeing 737 MAX jets have been flooding the 
aviation space ever since the deadly Ethiopian Airlines' crash on Mar 10, 2019. In fact, this was the second 
accident involving Boeing 737 MAX jets within a span of five months. The same model had crashed in Indonesia 
during October 2018, killing 189 people.The latest update came from American Airlines that suspended operations 
of its Boeing 737 Max jets until Dec 3, 2019, extending the grounding period from the previously announced Nov 2. 
American Airlines anticipates approximately 140 flights to be canceled per day through Dec 3. Also, United Airlines 
expects 737 MAX jets in its fleet to remain grounded through Dec 19 as opposed to Nov 3, expected earlier. 
Notably, Southwest Airlines LUV[8], which has 34 such jets in its fleet, had announced earlier that it will remove 
Boeing 737 MAX jets from its schedule until Jan 5, 2020. (Read more: American Airlines Extends Boeing 737 MAX 
Grounding Period[9])2. In a bid to expand its presence in the West Coast, Alaska Airlines announced that it aims to 
add eight new routes connecting the 'vibrant Pacific Northwest communities' with California cities like Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. For instance, there will be two daily departures from Spokane to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco each. While some of the above flights (for example, Spokane to Los Angeles) will start operations from 
Jan 7, 2020, most others (for example, Spokane to San Francisco, Missoula to Los Angeles) will take to the skies 
from Mar 19. (Read more: Alaska Airlines to Boost West Coast Presence With New Routes[10])3. To meet the 
surge in demand during the upcoming winter season, Delta intends to ramp up services to popular Caribbean 
destinations from its hubs. To this end, the carrier aims to launch an additional daily flight from Dec 21, 2019, in the 
New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK)-Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU) route. Post commencement

of this new service, Delta will offer a total of four daily flights on the same route. (Read more: Delta to Boost 
Caribbean Services From Its Hubs This Winter[11])Delta carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[12].4. Ryanair, which operates as a holding group company 
and includes several airlines, stated that highly-experienced Eddie Wilson has replaced Michael O'Leary as chief 
executive officer (CEO) of the group's biggest airline, Ryanair DAC, with immediate effect. Notably, Wilson has 
been associated with the airline for 22 years. O'Leary will, however, continue to function as the group's 
CEO.Additionally, Ryanair's August traffic report was impressive, with the metric (including 0.6 million from its 
LaudaMotion unit) increasing 8% year over year to 14.9 million. However, the load factor remained unaltered at 
97%. The carrier operated more than 81,000 scheduled flights in August.5. Azul's AZUL[13] cargo division — Azul 
Cargo Express — has entered into a new agreement with Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce company in Latin 
America, for deliveries across Brazil. The two companies have started working together earlier this year. Presently, 
Azul derives 10% of its cargo revenues from Mercado Libre. The company's cargo business is benefiting 
immensely from rapid e-commerce growth. Notably, its cargo revenues increased 44% during the first half of 2019. 
The new deal should further fortify its cargo operations.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement 
of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that all airline 
stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 3.8% to $92.89. 
Over the course of six months, the same depreciated 3.5% due to double-digit losses at the likes of Spirit Airlines 
and American Airlines.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will look forward to August traffic reports from the 
likes of SkyWest in the coming days. Updates on the impact of Hurricane Dorian on airline operations will also be 
awaited.Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than MarijuanaAmericans spend an estimated $150 billion in this

Highlight: Airports are often seen as lucrative money trees, capable of attracting airlines and investors across a 
wide range of departments including retail and advertising.
Body
As recent figures from the Airport Council International (ACI) show, global airport industry revenues generated over 
$172bn in 2017, making it a very profitable market for companies around the world. Financial prosperity is however, 
not something that all hubs can boast. Poor traffic rates and scarce lack of funds are only some of the causes 
behind some airports' economic misery, though often times, they make for a good reason for owners to put them on 
sale. In June this year, Glasgow's Prestwick Airport, in Scotland, fell victim to misfortune and was put up on the 
market by the Scottish Government after yet another year of financial losses. 
Several other airports have faced a similar fate over the past few years, in some occasions as part of privatisation 
moves and in others, simply because they failed to generate enough revenue. Here's a look at some of the most 
curious episodes of airports put on sale around the world and the reasons behind their downfall. Prestwick Airport, 
UK Fresh from being put on the market just a few months ago, Prestwick Airport's future is still hanging by a thread, 
with deadline for bids set for 6 September. Outrage exploded among airport unions when the Scottish Government 
announced plans to sell it at the beginning of the holiday season, with many pointing to the negative impacts its sale 
could have on employees and the South Ayrshire area where it is based. Yet as concerning as it might be, the 
decision should not have come as a surprise to many, with the ill-fated hub having long suffered dwindling 
passenger rates and business opportunities. Years of financial misery had, in fact, previously convinced former 
owner Infratil to put Prestwick on the market, having incurred losses of £2m in 2012. The company eventually found 
a buyer - the Scottish Government - in 2013 and agreed to the sale for a rather modest fee of £1. But not even the 
£40m loans it received from Holyrood managed to keep it alive, as figures from January 2019 showed the hub's 
debt had amounted to about £38.4m. As the September deadline looms, Ryanair is currently the only airline 
operating at Prestwick. Ciudad Real Central Airport, Spain The history of Spain's (EURO)1bn Ciudad Real Central 
Airport - previously known as Don Quijote Airport - is one that still baffles many. Located a couple of hours from the 
capital Madrid, in the Ciudad Real region, it was meant to become the pride of Spain and serve ten million travellers 
a year. Instead, a decade since its construction, it's one of the most prominent victims of Spain's recession years, 
On the block: a look at airport sales around the world
which turned it into an almost entirely unused emblem of the country's past struggles. Three years after its 
pompous opening, it was abruptly shut down in 2012 due to the owning company's financial difficulties and a steep 
decline in flights. The unfortunate hub was then put up on sale twice between 2012 and 2015; although a couple of 
foreign investors initially showed interest, they never went far enough to close in on a deal, leaving the abandoned 
to roast under the Spanish sun. Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, Sri Lanka Bad luck has been haunting the 
southern Sri Lankan airport of Mattala Rajapaksa almost from when it began operations in 2013. Originally set to 
become the second largest international airport in the country, Mattala Rajapaksa's reputation now precedes it; it is 
now often referred to as the emptiest hub in the world. Having been built on the back of a staggering $190m-worth 
of loans provided by the Bank of China - for a total cost of $210m -  in its first year in operation, it handled a mere 
3,000 flights and served just 21,000 people despite its capacity of one million passengers. With no international 
flights using Mattala Airport as of 2018, the Sri Lankan Government might now have now found a way to restore its 
name. Having been looking for potential buyers since June 2016, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in 
March that the doomed airport might soon be run in a joint venture with the Indian Aviation Authority. The deal could 
open up to a new range of possibilities - as well as, more importantly, passengers - to the aging hub and the 
community it serves. The BAA's six UK airports Not long ago, several British airports were owned by a single 
company whose local and international prestige threatened to reach concerning levels. Now known as Heathrow 
Airport Holdings, until 2014, the British Airports Authority (BAA) was responsible for operating seven airports in the 
UK, including top names such as Gatwick, Heathrow and Stanstead. Established in the 1960s to handle four British 
hubs, in the space of a few decades, the company's portfolio doubled to include Naples International Airport in Italy, 
the unlucky Glasgow Prestwick and many others. However, its growing monopoly within the UK aviation industry 
became such that it was forced to sell off all of its airports apart from Heathrow, as imposed by the UK Competition 
Commission. As a result, the BAA sold a first batch of hubs - which included Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh -
between 2009 and 2013, and another three - Aberdeen, Southampton and Glasgow airports in 2014. Adani Group's 
brand new six airports in India   In November 2018, the Indian Government kicked off a new round of infrastructure 
privatisation by putting six airports - namely Ahmedabad, Jaipur Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram, and 
Mangaluru - up for sale. However, over the first few months, political uncertainty and mounting debt weighing on the 
shoulders of several infrastructure companies looked likely to compromise the hubs' attractiveness and their future. 
But as of March this year, the six airports have found a more than wealthy benefactor in Indian billionaire Gautam 
Adani, chairman and founder of mines-to-energy conglomerate Adani Group. Adani emerged as the highest bidder 
for the whole batch, whose purchase is going to make the company the third-largest operator in India. The deal was 
not completed without controversy, as different players across the Indian aviation sector claimed Adani has no 
experience within this industry, and hinted his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi determined his success 
over other more established bidders. "The entire bid process appears to be mysterious," said Pinarayi Vijayan, the 
chief minister of Kerala state, after Adani Group had already won five of the six contracts. "If not, how can a single 
person win all the five bids?"

Ryanair has appointed Eddie Wilson, the man in charge of the low-cost airline's union negotiations over the past 
two years, as chief executive of its main airline business following an overhaul of the company's structure.
Mr Wilson, a 22-year veteran of Ryanair, will become chief executive of the budget airline from September 1. He will 
report to Michael O'Leary, who this year took on a new role of group chief executive overseeing all of its brands.
In his current job as chief people officer, Mr Wilson has played a key role in the negotiations with unions since 
Ryanair agreed to recognise them in late 2017 after a rostering failure and staff shortage led to flight cancellations.
But talks have progressed fitfully, and the airline has been hit with intermittent strike action during the past year over 
pay and conditions. Some UKbased pilots are due to go on strike for three days next week, from September 2, 
while members of its Spanish cabin crew union are holding 10 days of walkouts throughout September. However, 
Ryanair said it expected its schedule to operate largely as normal in the UK. It comes after a 48-hour strike by 
members of the British Airline Pilots Association last week which resulted in minimal disruption.
In a memo to staff yesterday, Mr O'Leary said Mr Wilson had "made a huge contribution" to Ryanair's success since 
he joined the carrier in 1997. During this period, Ryanair has grown from carrying 3m passengers a year to more 
than 150m.

main business
He said he hoped Mr Wilson would build on the "successful improvements" that the airline has delivered during the 
past 12 months, particularly as the carrier navigates "very difficult times", pointing to Brexit, delivery delays of the 
Boeing Max aircraft and having to close some bases because of slower growth.
Mr Wilson's appointment comes six months after Ryanair announced it would move to a "group structure not 
dissimilar to that of IAG", owner of British Airways and Iberia, with a small senior management team overseeing 
subsidiaries.
In a new role as head of Ryanair Holdings, Mr O'Leary oversees the chief executives of the main Ryanair carrier, as 
well as Laudamotion, based in Austria, Buzz, in Poland, and Malta Air. He is responsible for decisions including 
merger and acquisition opportunities, costs and acquiring aircraft.
Mr O'Leary will be chief executive of Ryanair Holdings until at least 2024.

Ryanair's appointment of chief people officer Eddie Wilson as the mainline carrier's new chief executive marks a 
departure from the usual pipeline of airline leaders.
FlightGlobal's recent survey of the top 100 airlines and groups showed that none of the incumbent chief executives 
had stepped into the position from a chief people officer role or equivalent.
The most common roles held by airline leaders immediately before taking up the position were chief executive at 
another airline or business (25), president or deputy chief executive (20), and chief operating officer (14).
Indeed, after the February announcement that Ryanair was seeking a new mainline chief executive, there was 
speculation that the carrier's chief operating officer Peter Bellew – the former head of Malaysia Airlines – was a 
strong candidate. It has since been announced that Bellew will be taking the vacant chief operating officer role at 
EasyJet.Wilson's suitability for the role would undoubtedly have been boosted by the fact that as chief people 
officer, he has been close to one of Ryanair’s biggest challenges in recent months: its recognising of unions.

His appointment does, however, continue the trend for airlines to appoint internal candidates. Some 79 of the 100 
chief executives in FlightGlobal’s survey came from the same airline or group.
Wilson also continues the trend for airlines to appoint male chief executives, despite O'Leary stating at the A4E 
Summit in Brussels on 6 March that "if I had a choice, I'd have a female, just because that would be a very 
significant break with the past in Ryanair".
E ANALYSIS: Ryanair rejects usual pipeline in choice of new CEO Ryanair 's appointment of chief people 
officer Eddie Wilson as the mainline carrier’s new chief ....
O'Leary added in Brussels that he thought the new chief executive was "likely to be an internal candidate, because 
they understand the business".
Wilson will step into the role on 1 September, as O'Leary moves into the group chief executive position.
Plans for O'Leary to take the group role were announced in February when the airline unveiled a structure similar to 
that of British Airways and Iberia parent IAG. At the same time, O’Leary committed to spend another five years at 
Ryanair.
"We believe this group structure will deliver cost and operating efficiencies, while enabling the group to look at other 
small-scale merger and acquisition opportunities," Ryanair said at the time.
Wilson will report into O'Leary, along with the chief executives of Buzz, Lauda and Malta Air.

Ryanair veteran Eddie Wilson is to replace Michael O'Leary as chief executive of the group's main airline, effective 
1 September.
O'Leary will become chief executive of the holding company that oversees Ryanair, its Austrian subsidiary Lauda, 
Polish unit Buzz, and Malta Air.
Wilson has been at the Irish low-cost carrier for 22 years and is currently Ryanair's chief people officer – in which 
position he has been intensely involved in the airline's often fractious relations with employee unions.
O'Leary says Wilson will report to him as group chief, joining the company's weekly meeting alongside the chief 
executives of Buzz, Lauda and Malta Air.
"We hope he will build on the successful improvements that the airline has delivered over the last 12 months, 
particularly as we enter into very difficult times," O'Leary wrote in a note to staff, referencing the challenge of Brexit 
at the end of October, as well as the Boeing 737 Max crisis that will result in the airline having at least 30 fewer 
aircraft this winter "and possibly the same number, or even more, again next summer".

Ryanair is facing intensified industrial action in Spain as the SEPLA pilot union has announced strike dates for 19, 
20, 22, 27 and 29 September.
Around 900 pilots will be invited to walk out in protest at the closures of Ryanair bases in Lanzarote, Tenerefe, Las 
Palmas and Girona, eliminating a total of 120 jobs.
The action would take place alongside strikes by Spanish unions USO and SITCPLA, which represent cabin crew. 
They have called for action across the country on 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 and 29 September.
SEPLA accuses Ryanair of seeking to establish a series of "low cost of a low cost" companies to drive down wages 
and standards. It cites the establishment of a base in Palma de Mallorca by Ryanair subsidiary Lauda and the 
creation of Buzz Air, a Polish subsidiary that is offering pilot jobs in the Canary Islands.
The union says Ryanair is continuing to hire pilots, and argues that this "would make these layoffs inadmissible". 
SEPLA also questions whether Ryanair has followed the correct procedures in dismissing employees.
SEPLA president Oscar Sanguino states that the union will continue to engage with Ryanair in an effort to avoid the 
strikes: "We will exhaust all the ways to avoid this, but we remember that we are only defending our jobs."
Ryanair is facing the threat of industrial action in several European countries by pilots and cabin crew who accuse 
the airline of providing poor employment conditions.
Responding to the strikes called by SEPLA, SITCPLA and USO, the budget carrier states: "As the closure of 
Ryanair's loss-making winter bases in the Canaries cannot, and will not, be reversed, these strikes are unnecessary 
and doomed to fail."
Spanish pilot union calls five-day Ryanair strike Ryanair is facing intensified industrial action in Spain as the

The base closures are "irreversible until such time as the Boeing Max delivery delays are resolved", adds the 
airline.
It notes that it will have 30 fewer Boeing 737s than planned this winter as a result of those delivery delays. "This 
aircraft shortage has forced [us] to close some loss making winter bases, and cut aircraft numbers at others," it 
says. "These difficult decisions have affected many Ryanair bases this winter, not just in Spain but across eight 
other countries."
Ryanair also argues that as "almost all" the traffic at the Canary Islands bases originates overseas it "can be better 
served by aircraft based in other EU countries" without such "high costs and inefficiency".
The airline – which expects to cancel six Spanish flights on 1 September and eight the following day – warns that 
the calling of strikes "just eight weeks before Brexit" amounts to "an act of great self-harm" by the unions.

HE HOLIDAY plans of thous-ands of Britons have been put at risk by the threat of strikes by British Airways and 
Ryanair staff.
TBritish Airways pilots are set to strike on various dates throughout September over a pay dispute, after the airline 
lost an appeal to block the action. This led to customers spending hours over the Bank Holiday trying to rebook 
flights.
Ryanair pilots are also striking throughout September, having started their first action last week. It insists most 
flights have taken off as scheduled despite the protest.
YouGov data shows that public opinion of strike action is negative; half of Brits feel that it's an ineffective way of 
achieving change compared with just 32 per cent who think it can work. So how has public perception of both 
airlines suffered? Since strike talks began in July, public perception of British Airways and Ryanair has dipped, with 
the former suffering slightly more.
Buzz scores (a net measure of whether consumers have heard anything positive or negative about the brand in the 
last fortnight) were at plus 2.7 at the start of July and fell to minus 36.4 on 14 August - a massive 39.1 point drop. 
Scores have since recovered to minus 12.8, but are still declining as action continues.
Ryanair's scores haven't fared much better, falling steadily from minus 15.6 to minus 32.0 over the period (16.4 
point drop).
Pilots are on strike, but British Airways won't be grounded for long
However, although British Airway's perception has suffered more than Ryanair's, it still comes first for customer

past 12 months.
Comparatively, Ryanair's score is minus 9. If this pay dispute can be resolved, then customer perception should 
rebound quickly.

British Airways passengers will face travel disruption next month after the airline's pilots announced three days of 
strike action in a dispute over pay.
Members of the British Airline Pilots' Association, Balpa, confirmed plans to walk out on September 9, 10 and 27 
after talks between the union and Britain's flag carrier broke down.
The impact is expected to be large. The union represents a big majority of BA's pilots and the walkouts are taking 
place at a busy time for the airline.
Last month members of Balpa voted 9-1 in favour of strike action, on a 90 per cent turnout. BA subsequently failed 
in an attempt to block mass walkouts through a court injunction.
Balpa said the decision to go on strike was a "last resort" and had been taken with "enormous frustration at the way 
business is now being run. It is clear following discussions with members over the past few days that BA's most 
recent offer will not gain the support of anywhere near a majority of its pilots".
The carrier said it had made a "very fair offer"; it was "completely unacceptable that Balpa is destroying the travel 
plans of tens of thousands" of passengers. It said its pay offer of 11.5 per cent over three years was fair, and 
highlighted that the Unite and GMB unions, which represent nearly 90 per cent of BA workers, had recommended 
the same pay offer to their members.
BA passengers face disruption as pilots announce strikes Airlines
The airline said it was making changes to its schedule but it was likely that many of its customers would not be able 
to travel. It would offer refunds and re-bookings for passengers booked on cancelled flights.
BA said it was exploring options to supplement its fleet with aircraft and crew from other airlines, a practice known 
as wet-leasing. It was working with partner airlines to schedule larger aircraft to take more customers.
The strike action comes amid separate walkouts by Ryanair's British pilots, which ended yesterday. The carrier on 
Wednesday lost a High Court bid to block a two-day strike by its British pilots, represented by Balpa, but the carrier 
faced minimal disruption.

Aug 23, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair said 
Friday it is closing four of its bases in Spain, a move a union said would result in more than 500 job losses.The low-
cost airline, facing a September cabin strike, said it would shut its Canary Islands bases of Tenerife, Lanzarote and 
Gran Canaria as well as Gerona from January after a review showed "significant overcapacity in the European 
short haul market".The news, in a statement flagging up "formal notification of collective dismissal prceedings," 
comes after two profit warnings in the past 10 months at Ryanair and on the back of a 41 percent dive in first-
quarter earnings.The carrier also blamed Boeing 737 Max aircraft delivery delays affecting its plane allocations for 
the coming months. The company said that following a commercial review "a number of bases," including the 
Spanish quartet, would close effective from January 8."Our main focus will be on minimising job losses with 
transfers," the airline said, adding that under Spanish law a collective redundancies consulation process would be 
entered into with a negotiating commission set up to that effect by September 8.The USO union said in a statement 
that just as it was engaged in talks on providing a minimum service for 10 strike days Ryanair had informed it by 
email of the impending closures -- citing Brexit worries as an additional factor. 
USO added that 512 Spanish-based staff were set to lose their jobs.The union accused the carrier of "dismantling" 
its Spanish operations and lamented that the airline had also published other vacancies elsewhere in its 
system."The closures and the layoffs are not justified and Ryanair will have to provide explanations to the Spanish 
labour authorities," said USO secretary Jairo Gonzalo.The cabin strike is scheduled to start on September 1 and 
continue on nine other days across the month after talks between management and unions failed.

Budget carrier Ryanair yesterday announced plans to add Bucharest and Vilnius routes from London Southend – 
just hours after rival Wizz Air confirmed its intention to serve those same destinations from the UK airport.
Ryanair and Wizz both plan to fly five times weekly to Romanian capital Bucharest from Southend. Lithuanian 
capital Vilnius will be served twice weekly by Wizz and three times a week by Ryanair.
The Irish carrier's chief commercial officer David O'Brien states: "Ryanair is pleased to continue its central and 
eastern European expansion with the launch of two new Southend routes to Bucharest and Vilnius, commencing in 
November, as part of our extended winter 2019 schedule."
Ryanair had on 21 August announced it would begin flights from Georgia, linking capital Tbilisi with Bergamo and 
Kutaisi with another Italian destination, Bologna, and with Marseille in France.
Cirium schedules data shows that Ryanair's 279 flights from Southend this month account for 27% of the total from 
the airport. EasyJet has a 34% share, with 358 flights. Activity at the airport has grown significantly over the past 
year: the number of flights in August, which exceeds 1,000, is up 13.3% on the same month last year.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said in a Twitter post that it does not expect any changes to its UK flight schedule on Friday as 
the strike initiated by its British-based pilots enters its second day.
Earlier this week, a London court rejected the Irish budget airliner's injunction that would have prevented British 
pilots from striking.
"All 1st wave flights to/from the UK departed as scheduled this morning without any disruption - and we expect this 
to continue for the rest of the day," the company said.

Ryanair has always been a somewhat contrary airline. It penalises passengers who can't print their own boarding 
passes (as much as (EURO)600, according to the Economist). It makes families pay extra to sit together (not 
always worth the (EURO)4, according to this columnist). So it's perhaps not surprising that it only lands all its flights 
on time when its pilots are on strike.
At least, that's how it seemed yesterday. Despite nearly 30 per cent of Ryanair's UK pilots taking the first of five 
days of strike action, the airline reported "97 per cent punctuality ... without any disruption". Before the strike, its on-
time performance was 90 per cent. At one point, the only plane delayed at Stansted airport was one of rival 
easyJet's.
Passengers may have been relieved, but shareholders will have worried about the cost. Before the industrial action, 
analysts at broker Liberum had warned: "The UK is the largest pilot pool within Ryanair ... we would anticipate 
material levels of disruption." RBC's plane-spotters suggested the cost of this disruption, in lost revenue and extra 
expenditure, would be (EURO)30m over the five days, or 2-4 per cent of net profit.
For Ryanair, the potential hit to its p&l could not have arrived at a worse time - a bit like one in ten of its flights when 
there isn't a strike on. It has just had to trim some of its full-year revenue guidance and those Bernstein analysts 
reckon it will need a 6 per cent rise in fares in the second half to achieve that - not easy with fares forecast to be 6 
per cent down in the first half, and strikes now in the news. Delays to deliveries of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft have 
Ryanair pilots' strike might not leave shares grounded for long UK COMPANIES
already cut summer 2020 revenue growth forecasts from 7 per cent to around 3 per cent, with knock-on effect on 
earnings.
However, might the actual disruption to Ryanair's profits prove as limited as the disruption to passengers? Two 
factors suggest it could.
First, the airline has the pilot numbers, and the pilot mobility, to cope with a 30 per cent UK walkout. It recently said 
it has 500 more pilots that it needs, partly because of the 737 MAX delays, and ironically because other union pay 
deals have cut resignations to "effectively zero". Nor are its pilots - unlike its passengers - likely to be going 
anywhere. RBC analysts doubt that 737-qualified pilots could find alternative employment right now as no major 
operators are hiring - Norwegian is overstaffed, KLM is fleet-constrained and SAS is exiting the 737.
Second, revenue may yet surprise on the upside. While fares were down 6 per cent in the first half, ancillaries were 
up 27 per cent (all those charges) and are expected to support overall revenue growth. Tighter capacity in the 
European market, exacerbated by the 737 MAX delays, may even help fares in the short term.
Buying Ryanair's shares - 10 per cent cheaper since the UK strike ballot - might not be so different to buying (and 
printing) a ticket: a contrarian gamble that actually takes off.
It is perhaps unlikely that Agent 007 would be building up an appetite over $10m poker hands at one of Rank 
Group's Grosvenor casinos. Were he to do so, however, this is what he might find. As part of chief executive John 
O'Reilly's turnround plan, the company is seeking extra revenue streams from its assets - and casino chefs who are 
paid to work all night but generally don't are an obvious place to start. So, now, their skills are for hire via fast food 
apps, and Rank is also trying new leisure-led casino formats.
It is equally doubtful that Vesper Lynd would frequent a Mecca bingo hall. Were she to do so, however, she would 
find attempts to appeal to her demographic. Rank is trying younger "night out" entertainment formats.
Some of these measures are working: the casino initiatives and cost cuts turned a 35 per cent fall in first-half 
operating profit into a 40 per cent rise in the second half. But with bingo footfall down and profit flat, group pretax 
profit fell 6 per cent to £70m.
What Rank needs is would-be Bonds skipping the restaurant altogether, and going home to play its virtual casino 
games. It regards its multichannel "wallet" - which lets punters play in its casinos and online - as key to catching up 
with digital rivals. But with only 80,000 signed up so far, and marketing spend essential to winning clients from 
established players, it's going to need pockets as deep as MI6's.
matthew.vincent@ft.com A Rank recipe? Casino Royale, scene 166.
James Bond, having defeated Le Chiffre at the poker table, retires to the restaurant to celebrate with Vesper Lynd.
Bond: I'll have a dry martini: three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet, shake it over 
ice, then add a slice of lemon peel. Vesper: Make that two.
Bond: And bring us some beluga caviar, then the lobster ... Head waiter: Yes sir, but I am afraid there may be a 
slight delay.
Bond: Why? Head waiter: Well, the kitchen has just taken some rather large orders from Uber Eats and Deliveroo ...

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) plans to close four Spanish bases starting in January, Reuters reported on Friday,

All Ryanair flights to and from British and Irish airports have departed without disruption so far on Thursday, the 
airline said, adding it also expected no impact for the rest of the day from a strike by some of its pilots based in 
Britain.
Ryanair unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have been planning strikes over various grievances that 
began with a five-day cabin crew walkout in Portugal on Wednesday and continued with a 48-hour strike by some 
UK pilots on Thursday.
Europe's biggest low cost airlines said its first flights to and from UK airports on Thursday operated with 97% 
punctuality, with the slight slip due to air traffic control delays.
While more widespread strikes over pay and conditions a year ago forced Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, the 
airline has forecast minimal disprution this time and ran a full schedule without major delays in the first day of action 
in Portugal.
With the exception of two delayed flights, all departures from Portugal appeared to be operating as normal on 
Thursday.
Fernando Gandra, head of the SNPVAC trade union representing striking Portuguese cabin crew, told Reuters the 
airline had managed the fallout by making major changes to departure times in advance and notifying passengers 
ahead of time.
Ryanair also limited the potential disruption by taking its fight to the courts on Wednesday and winning an Irish High 
Court injunction to prevent Dublin-based pilots striking.
Ryanair expects no disruption to Irish and UK schedules
A London court rejected a similar application against its British pilots, who plan a second strike from the early hours 
of Sept. 2 until just before midnight on Sept. 4.
Ryanair has said the striking pilots, members of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), represent less than 
30% of those operating its aircraft there.
Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said this week their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after 
a round of mediated talks with the airline ended without agreement.
The strikes are the first since Ryanair managed to quell last year's disputes by reaching pay deals with many staff 
in Europe following its dramatic U-turn in late 2017 to recognize trade unions for the first time.
However, it has failed to move beyond recognition deals with others and further angered unions by telling staff last 
month that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 
MAX, and would have to close some bases. (Reuters)

Ryanair is discussing possible entry to the Armenian market next year, as the budget carrier unveiled its first 
services to Georgia.
Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan and other senior government figures have met with Ryanair management 
personnel including commercial chief David O'Brien and route development director Kate Sherry.
The prime minister says the government is prioritising tourism and views civil aviation as being important to 
development of the sector.
Ryanair intends to enter the Armenian market "in the near future", the government states, indicating 2020 as a 
provisional timeframe. The carrier is holding talks with the country's Civil Aviation Committee and Yerevan's 
Zvartnots airport.
The prime minister welcomes the plan, says the government, and has expressed "readiness" to support the 
carrier's plans to commence services.
Ryanair has detailed an expansion into the Caucasus region with its first routes to neighbouring Georgia.
It is to operate services to the capital Tbilisi from Milan Bergamo and Cologne, as well as links to Kutaisi from 
Bologna and Marseille.
The routes will commence in November except for the Cologne-Tbilisi link which starts in April 2020.
Ryanair operates a fleet of Boeing 737-800 jets. "We look forward to developing new Georgian traffic growth, new 
routes and jobs in the coming years," says O'Brien.

Budget airline Ryanair was able to operate a normal schedule in Britain on Thursday morning in spite of a strike by 
pilots, local media reported.
There had been fears of delays after Ryanair lost a court bid on Wednesday to stop its British pilots from taking part 
in strike action.
However, the airline on Thursday reported a 97 per cent punctuality rate for its first departures and arrivals at British 
airports, according to a statement carried by the PA news agency.
"We do not expect any disruptions to our flights to or from ourUK airports today," Ryanair said.
A judge in London on Wednesday rejected Ryanair's application for an injunction against the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (Balpa), which was planning labour action on Thursday and Friday as well as on a series of dates in 
September.
The High Court in Dublin earlier ruled in favour of a similar request by Ryanair to block a strike by its pilots in 
Ireland.
The airline is also facing problems with its staff in Portugal, where the union for cabin crew members has called a 
five-day strike this week, though no considerable disruptions were expected there.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair staff across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
the summer holiday season in August and September.

Irish graduates are overlooking Irish companies in favour of large-scale multinationals based on the island, 
according to new research by global employer brand specialist, Universum. 
This year more than 10,000 Irish university students from 22 universities, in six main fields of study shared their 
views on the most attractive career paths and employers in the Ireland.
Google took the top spot for both the engineering/IT and business rankings. The remainder of the top ten for both 
fields of study is also occupied by many other well know multinationals with Bank of Ireland being the only domestic 
employer to appear in either top ten list.
Outside the top ten is a very different story. Here array of national firms are seen such as AIB in 11th place, The 
Central Bank of Ireland came in 13th place, while, Jameson (Irish Distillers) followed in 14th place. This was 
followed by Aer Lingus at 18th place, RT&Eacute; at 19th place and Kerry Group at 20th place. Paddy Power, 
Glanbia, Enterprise Ireland and Penneys (Primark) also made the top thirty list.  
While no Irish firms are represented in the top ten on the engineering/IT rankings, ESB and Aer Lingus sit among 
the top twenty most attractive employers. Ryanair, Irish Rail and Jameson (Irish Distillers) made the top thirty.
Engineering and IT graduates have the highest salary expectations, deeming €35,951 to be an appropriate average 
annual salary for their skillset. This is followed by graduates of business and economics, who expect €34,952 on 
average annually. Graduates of natural sciences and medicine expect the lowest annual salary, an average of 
€34,729 per year.
Competition for talent between Irish and foreign multinationals at an all-time high
The research also finds that females expect a lower average annual salary across a number of industries, with a 
10% difference in expected salary between male and female graduates in engineering or IT and a 6% difference 
between genders in business. 
Respondents who classified as ‘Gen Z’ overall expect a higher salary than their ‘Gen Y’ counterparts – Gen Z 
graduates in business, engineering and IT command a 4% higher salary per year on average.
Speaking this week, General Manager of IrishJobs.ie, Orla Moran said, “With Ireland returning to full employment, 
employers are challenged now more than ever to go the extra mile in their recruitment efforts and in particular, 
graduate recruitment. Multinationals have had a transformative effect on the Irish workplace, and they are ahead of 
the pack in attracting the brightest and best. Irish companies have just as much to offer but need to consider how 
they showcase themselves to candidates.”
She added, “A key part of this is understanding what their point of difference is, where they can stand out from the 
crowd and most importantly, how they can position their brand among the right cohort of talent.”

Aug 22, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair flew an 
almost full service on Thursday, the Irish no-frills airline said despite strikes by pilots and cabin crew based in 
Britain and Portugal triggered by pay disputes."All first wave flights to and from UK airports departed as scheduled 
this morning, with 97 percent punctuality," Ryanair said in a statement, adding that the minimal disruption was due 
to air traffic control delays."We do not expect any disruptions to our flights to/from our UK airports today," it 
added.Meanwhile in Portugal, the only delay was to a flight from Porto to Milan, which was put back until the 
afternoon. Pilots in Britain were striking Thursday and Friday, while cabin crew in Portugal were on their second day 
of a five-day walkout.Ryanair's Britain-based pilots won permission late Wednesday to strike following a ruling by 
London's High Court after the Irish carrier demanded it be blocked.However the High Court in Dublin has prevented 
Ireland-based pilots from joining the walkout.In Portugal, disruption has been limited after the country's government 
ordered workers to deliver at least a minimum service.Ryanair cabin crew in Spain have called for ten days of 
strikes in September.The minimal fallout from the strikes contrasts to last year when pan-European stoppages 
affected thousands of passengers -- and led to Ryanair offering improved pay to staff via landmark deals with 
unions.But Irish union Forsa claims its 2018 agreement was limited to matters of the time only.Ryanair claims Forsa 
has not outlined specific pay demands, has been hasty in their movement to strike and conducted the strike ballot 
improperly.The strikes come as the Dublin-based carrier faces several headwinds that are cutting into its growth 
and profits.Ryanair's first-quarter net profits sank by more than one-fifth on rising costs, intense competition and 
Brexit turmoil -- issues that continue to affect the budget airline that flies mainly throughout Europe.Against this 
backdrop, Ryanair recently slashed its growth outlook and is temporarily shutting bases, also as crisis-hit Boeing 
pushes back plane delivery owing to fatal crashes that grounded its 737 MAX jets.

Ryanair's combative chief executive Michael O'Leary is not a man prone to understatement. But when he was 
quoted as saying that cutting off his own hands was preferable to recognising trade unions, his point was clear. 
Keeping organised labour out of his aircraft has been a key feature of Ryanair's low-cost business model that, over 
the course of three-and-a-half decades, has powered its ascent from regional player with one 15-seat turboprop to 
Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers.
But by December 2017, this tough stance was becoming unsustainable. Autumn had brought major disruption and 
cancellations amid a pilot shortage, and Christmas threatened to be no better – forcing O'Leary's hand. "Christmas 
flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted 
by pilot industrial action," he said. "If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union 
process, then we are prepared to do so." The airline’s share price fell on the news, but the threat of strikes receded.

Greater accommodation of the unions seemed to follow. Starting autumn 2018, Ryanair signed a series of collective 
labour agreements with unions. An initial deal with Italian pilots was followed by CLAs with cabin crews in Germany, 
Italy and Belgium and then pilots in Portugal, Belgium and Ireland, something that served to "demonstrate the 
considerable progress we’re making in concluding union agreements with our people in our major EU markets", 
ANALYSIS: Ryanair's industrial relations stuck in holding pattern Ryanair's combative chief executive Michael 
O'Leary is not a man prone to understatement. But ....
Ryanair argued. More was to come, it promised: the aim was to seal CLAs in all of the airline's main markets by the 
end of March 2019.
"O'Leary is nothing if not flexible and adaptable," notes John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting. "There are 
many areas of business where he's said he's against something, then has changed his mind when he's seen the 
wisdom of doing so." In this case, faced with ever-assertive unions, a European pilot shortage, and reputational 
damage from a series of strikes and cancellations caused by lack of staff, recognising the unions and increasing 
pilots' pay was a crucial step.
But Ryanair's plan was multifaceted, Strickland points out. "The strategy also gave them the opportunity to damage 
their competitors," he says. As European budget carriers competed for pilots' services, their salaries were rising 
across the board – and Ryanair was in a better position to raise wages than most. Doing so not only stemmed the 
flow of pilots leaving, but also made life difficult for rivals such as Norwegian.
Clever though Ryanair's strategy may have been, it has run into difficulties which have intensified over recent 
months. No fresh CLAs have been sealed since Portuguese pilots signed up in April, while increasingly fractious 
relations with staff in the UK, Spain, Ireland and elsewhere have caused strike-threat headlines to scroll across our 
screens once again. On 21 August, Ryanair learned the outcomes of two court actions aimed at blocking strikes – 
successful in Ireland, less so in the UK. A 48h strike by British pilots is now under way, although the airline has said 
it does not expect any disruption to flights.
"We see a change: we have a clear feeling that improving labour relations is shifting to a lower priority scale at 
Ryanair," says Philip von Schoppenthau, secretary general of the European Cockpit Association (ECA), an alliance 
of pilot unions.
Not only have several negotiations stalled, but Peter Bellew – Ryanair's operations chief and the chief negotiator 
with whom the unions had built up a level of trust – has departed to low-cost rival EasyJet. This move is itself now 
the subject of Irish legal action, brought by Ryanair against Bellew.
The ECA's concern is that a clue to Ryanair’s new strategy may lie in its establishment of Polish-based subsidiary 
Ryanair Buzz, which perhaps hints that the carrier is planning to shift workers to subsidiaries in lower-cost and non-
unionised locations. "This airline is being set up in a way that the pilots and cabin crew from established bases have 
been dismissed and asked to reapply as self-employed contractors in Warsaw Aviation," says von Schoppenthau, 
who worries that Ryanair will use the winter season as an opportunity to make a bigger shift.
This, he warns, would draw a swift response. "What Ryanair needs to know and what their shareholders need to 
know is that if they go down that route they risk facing massive confrontation with their own staff" as national unions 
run out of patience with negotiations that do not bear fruit, he says.
Ryanair declined to be interviewed for this article.
Events at aircraft supplier Boeing have further pressured the situation. Excepting its Austrian subsidiary Lauda, 
Ryanair has an an all-737 fleet. Cirium fleets data shows that the airline has 420 737NGs in service. It has 135 Max 
jets on order and holds options a further 75. The grounding of the Max has thus thrown the airline's planning into 
confusion. It has not received the number of aircraft it was expecting this year, and will not have as many as it had 
been due to have by the middle of next summer, either – the shortfall could be between 20 and 60 aircraft.
"They know that they have too many pilots, so they are having to deal with that challenge separately to the 
challenges about productivity," says Strickland.. O'Leary recently commented that the airline "would not rule out 
redundancies and job losses, which will be inevitable if these Max delays are as presently envisaged or get worse". 
Strickland notes that while this could be perceived as a negotiating position, "it's a reality – they are not going to 
have those aircraft".
ANALYSIS: Ryanair's industrial relations stuck in holding pattern Ryanair's combative chief executive Michael 
O'Leary is not a man prone to understatement. But ....
Given that a flight typically requires 4-5 crew members, and given the price of employing the pilots, even a relatively 
small reduction in aircraft capacity could mean that significant additional costs have needlessly been incurred, an 
anathema to Ryanair in light of its business model.
Yet it is a sign of how poor Ryanair’s industrial relations have become that the ECA's von Schoppenthau questions 
whether the airline's citing of the Max crisis is a tactic: he points out that it could simply fly older aircraft for longer. 
Any suggestion that Ryanair could be pulling back its labour-relations efforts in the face of a pilot surplus and a 
potential economic slowdown is similarly dismissed: "Ryanair certainly have a massive growth plan. To bank on 
their being an oversupply of pilots would be really short-sighted – we see lots of airlines hiring pilots from other 
airlines."
Not only this, but the ECA has further complaints about how Ryanair has negotiated its CLAs, complaining that the 
airline has often appeared to lack knowledge about local laws.
"The CLAs and recognition agreements with Ryanair are very generic, not very detailed," says von Schoppenthau. 
"A typical CLA in the industry can easily have 100 pages, but the Spanish recognition agreement is six pages. All 
those substantial terms and conditions that pilots are really interested in their daily lives, not just pay, are still to be 
negotiated in many countries."
He adds: "These CLAs and recognition agreements usually only apply to directly employed pilots, thereby excluding 
all those that Ryanair hires through broker agencies and those pilots who supposedly work as self-employed."
This perhaps strikes at the heart of the issue. While the salaries on offer from Ryanair have risen significantly, much 
of the focus from unions is now on improving conditions. "Ryanair work their staff extremely hard, and that is where 
the unions are trying to chip away," says Strickland.
The central theme of Ryanair's business model, of course, is low unit costs. As pilot and crew costs rise, profitability 
may naturally be threatened, particularly if other costs over which the airline has less control, such as fuel, also rise, 
or if revenue is hit by softening airfares.
If its pilots are the most productive in Europe, completing more flying hours than rival airlines', then Ryanair's unit 
cost per flying hour can remain market-leading, even though salaries have risen – they have, after all, increased 
across the board. But the airline cannot afford to allow some of the other terms and conditions to loosen much, 
warns Strickland.
Limiting the conditions and perks of its staff and keeping a laser focus on costs have proven an extremely 
successful strategy for Ryanair. Unless the airline intends to change this feature of its business model – and there 
is no indication that it does – further industrial conflict with the unions seems certain.

RYANAIR yesterday lost a legal bid to prevent its UK pilots from striking this week, but insisted its passengers 
would suffer little disruption.
The budget airline applied for a High Court injunction that would have stopped its UK pilots from striking today and 
tomorrow, meaning the industrial action will go ahead.
However, it said the "vast majority" of its pilots had volunteered to work on the strike days, allowing it to operate a 
full schedule from its UK airports. But it warned there could be some delays and changes to flights.
"We do not expect significant disruptions on Thursday or Friday, however we cannot rule out some small flight 
delays and/or flight changes," the airline said.
"We are working hard with our pilot teams to minimise any such delays for our customers and their families."
Ryanair has been locked in a dispute with pilots who are members of the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) 
over issues such as pensions, licence insurance, maternity benefit, allowances and the airline's pay structures.
Ryanair said it was "unreasonable" that the pay of captains "should be doubled from a current £170,000 per annum 
to over £375,700 just nine weeks before Brexit, which could severely damage Ryanair's business and UK pilot 
jobs".
Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said: "Ryanair was foolish to bring this into the High Court rather than the 
negotiating room. We offered to meet Ryanair management at Acas to negotiate a resolution, but instead they 
Ryanair fails to win court bid to stop pilot strike
attempted a legal bludgeon. That's backfired. However, we are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring 
about a change in Ryanair for the better.
"In the event that Ryanair rejects our overture and therefore the action over the next two days does go ahead, we 
apologise to the passengers who will be affected. Such action could have been avoided if Ryanair adopts a different 
approach."

THE FTSE 100 rose yesterday as oil majors tracked gains in crude prices and exporters benefited from a weaker 
pound, while markets waited for minutes of the US Federal Reserve's July meeting for signs of further policy 
easing.
The blue-chip index added 1.1 per cent to close at 7,203.97 points, posting its largest gains in nearly three weeks, 
with a boost from Shell and BP helping the index recover most of the previous session's losses. The mid-cap FTSE 
250 also rose by the same level, to 19,207.75 points.
BAT, Astrazeneca and other stocks that book a major chunk of their earnings in dollars gained from a fall in sterling 
as investors took little heart from hints by German Chancellor Angela Merkel that there might be room for Brexit 
negotiation as chances of no deal grow.
NMC Health, a United Arab Emiratesbased healthcare provider, climbed more than four per cent to be among top 
FTSE 100 gainers ahead of today's scheduled trading update.
The overall mood was cheery ahead of the Fed's minutes with hopes of lower interest rates in the near-term to 
cushion blows from a bruising USChina trade war and quell fears of an impending recession.
On US President Donald Trump's Tuesday comments about confronting China over trade, Spreadex analyst 
Connor Campbell said: "That kind of talk puts even more pressure on the Fed to safeguard the American economy, 
meaning investors are going to be on high alert for hints."
Merging mid-cap lenders Onesavings and Charter Court Financial gave up five and 4.6 per cent respectively, after 
they warned of the Brexit impact on housing and credit.
Exporters boost FTSE ahead of US Fed minutes LONDON REPORT
"The bank warned it will tighten its lending criteria on account of the 'macroeconomic outlook' and that played on 
traders' minds," CMC Markets' analyst David Madden said.
Ryanair slipped one per cent after a London court rejected the Irelandbased budget carrier's application to prevent 
some of its British pilots from going on strike later in the week.

Central European budget carrier Wizz Air is to venture into London Southend operations with three routes to 
Romania and Lithuania.
The airline has reached an agreement for the services with Southend airport operator Stobart Group.
Stobart states that Wizz will open connections to Bucharest and Sibiu in Romania, as well as the Lithuanian capital 
Vilnius, over the course of October-November this year.
Wizz will operate the links with Airbus A320s.
Southend airport has gradually expanded its route network through budget operators EasyJet and Ryanair, as well 
as other airlines such as Air Malta and Flybe.
Stobart says the agreement with Wizz takes its overall destination count to more than 40. "This is part of our plan to 
become London's next big airport," it adds.
Southend's operator is aiming to reach 5 million annual passengers by February 2023, compared with 1.5 million in 
2018.

 (Updates with reports Ryanair fails in its attempt to stop UK pilots' strike in the first three paragraphs.)
Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) is reported to have failed in its legal bid to stop its UK-based pilots to go strike on 
Thursday and Friday, after having secured an injunction from the Irish High Court preventing the carrier's Dublin-
based pilots from embarking on industrial action later this week.
A UK high court in London ruled pilots represented by the British Airline Pilots' Association could press ahead with 
their strike, a report from the Guardian said.
In early August, Ryanair pilots in the UK joined pilots in Ireland in voting to strike over pay and conditions, with the 
Association announcing two 48-hour walkouts, one from Aug. 22-23 and another from  Sept. 2-4, according to a 
report from the BBC.
Meanwhile, the low-cost airline's Portuguese cabin crew began a strike on Wednesday, with the company warning 
passengers that a small number of flights might be affected and the government ordering workers to deliver a 
minimum service to avoid chaos, according to a report from Reuters.

A Portuguese labour union announced a strike at Ryanair as a court in Ireland approved a request by the Ireland-
based budget airline to prevent labour action there.
In Portugal, the union for cabin crew members called a five-day strike starting on Wednesday, Portuguese news 
agency Lusa reported.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair staff across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
the summer holiday season in August and September.
The High Court in Dublin ruled on Wednesday in favour of the airline's request to prevent a strike by pilots based in 
the country on Thursday and Friday.
The presiding judge was quoted by British news agency PA as saying he was preventing pilots' union Forsa "from 
directly or indirectly, organizing, directing or endorsing their members to participate in a strike on August 22 or 23."
British pilots are also seeking to take part in labour action on Thursday and Friday as well as on a series of dates in 
September, but face a similar injunction request by Ryanair.
A judge in London is set to hear an application by Ryanair to block the strike by its Britain-based pilots later 
Wednesday, British news agency PA reported.
Strikes could cause flight cancellations or delays in Europe, the airline said.
For Portugal, Ryanair does not expect any considerable disruptions because the airline has already arranged a 
minimal flight plan, which is required by the government, Lusa reported.

Belgium's CNE and ACV PULS trade unions have told members not to comply with a Ryanair request to staff flights 
affected by a planned strike by Portuguese crew from Wednesday, a letter sent to the airline seen by Reuters 
showed.
Unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have announced plans to strike in the coming weeks, a year after a 
wave of strikes over pay and conditions forced Europe's largest budget carrier to cancel hundreds of flights.
Ryanair has said it expects minimal disruption from the walkouts which are scheduled to begin with a five-day strike 
by Portuguese cabin crew trade union SNPVAC.
It said on Tuesday that a small number of flights from its Portuguese bases may be affected by minor schedule 
changes for five days from Aug. 21 and that all affected customers had already been notified.
In the letter to Ryanair, the two Belgian unions said cabin crew and pilots stationed in Belgium had been asked to 
staff some affected flights.
"Unfortunately we had to conclude that Ryanair decided to import the conflict that is going on in Portugal to 
Belgium... We cannot agree with this state of affairs and will therefore call on our members not to staff these 
flights," they said.
A spokesman for Portugal's SNPVAC union said it had received information that flights will be operated by crews 
from other bases and that this was a "violation of the right to strike."
Belgian unions tell members not to help Ryanair during Portugal strike
Ryanair managed to quell last year's disputes by striking pay deals with many staff in Europe after agreeing to 
recognise trade unions for the first time, but it has faied to do so with with others and further angered unions by 
telling staff last month that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed.
Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after more than 
seven hours of mediated talks with the airline ended on Tuesday without agreement.
The SITCPLA and USO workers' unions' threat of strike action is aimed at preventing closure of bases at Girona, 
Gran Canaria, and Tenerife South airports. The unions said on Tuesday that it had still not received any information 
on the base closures.
Ryanair's chief people officer told Reuters last week that the Gran Canaria and Tenerife South would likely close as 
part of plans to cut is presence on the ground in airports due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 
MAX.
A final decision had yet to be made on how many bases, jobs and routes would be cut, he added. (Reuters)

Budget airline Ryanair lost a court bid on Wednesday to stop its British pilots from taking part in strike action, after a 
similar request to block strikes in Ireland was approved.
British pilots are planning labour action on Thursday and Friday as well as on a series of dates in September.
A judge in London rejected Ryanair's application for an injunction against the British Airline Pilots' Association 
(Balpa), Britain's PA news agency reported.
Paul Gott, representing Ryanair, said strike action could be "enormously disruptive" and Ryanair would suffer 
"significant reputational" damage, the report said.
The judge said she had rejected Ryanair's "various technical and legal arguments," that the union had acted 
lawfully and that the strike could proceed.
The High Court in Dublin earlier ruled in favour of Ryanair's request to prevent a strike by pilots based in the 
country on Thursday and Friday.
The presiding judge in Dublin was quoted by PA as saying he was preventing pilots' union Forsa "from directly or 
indirectly organizing, directing or endorsing their members to participate in a strike on August 22 or 23."
The airline is also facing problems with its staff in Portugal, where the union for cabin crew members has called a 
five-day strike starting on Wednesday, Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.

British-based pilots will be allowed to strike as planned this week, the High Court in London ruled on Wednesday, 
but the High Court in Dublin blocked Ireland's pilots from joining in the walkout."The immediate industrial action 
(due Thursday and Friday) is restrained," Justice Denis McDonald told the court in Dublin.A total 180 directly-
employed Ryanair pilots -- members of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) -- had intended to match planned 
action by British pilots over pay.The no-frills airline said the High Court's decision to impose an injunction against 
the strike in Ireland "will come as a huge relief to thousands of Irish passengers and their families". The airline 
called on IALPA members -- working with parent union Forsa -- to return to mediation, but reiterated its hardline 
stance on pay negotiation."Small groups of workers, earning six-figure salaries should not be threatening to disrupt 
the holiday travel plans of Ryanair customers and their families," the carrier said in a statement.But the Dublin-
based airline lost its last-minute bid to cancel action by the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) in the High 
Court in London on Wednesday.A five-day strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Portugal meanwhile began Wednesday, 
but disruption was limited after the country's government ordered workers to deliver at least a minimum 
service.Ryanair cabin crew in Spain have called for ten days of strikes in September.The Irish court dispute centred 
on a 2018 agreement between pilots and management.Ryanair argued that was an "overarchingeuro; text which 
outlined how industrial action should not be taken until a mediation process had been completed.The carrier also 
said Forsa had not outlined specific pay demands, had been hasty in their movement to strike and conducted the 
strike ballot improperly.Forsa said the 2018 agreement was limited to matters of the time only and Ryanair had 
been "dismissive and showed no desire to engage in a reasonable manner with the pay proposal".Justice 
McDonald said there was a "gap in the evidence" regarding the strike ballot, in which 61 percent of members 
voted.His injunction was made on the condition that all parties return for a fuller hearing soon.

Irish carrier Ryanair expects to operate its full schedule of UK flights on 22 and 23 August despite failing to secure 
an injunction today preventing industrial action by pilots represented by the BALPA union.
Ryanair had earlier today secured an injunction in the Irish High Court preventing a planned two-day walkout over 
the same period by pilots in Ireland. But it failed in efforts to get an injunction in the UK High Court to prevent the 
planned stoppage by UK pilots.

Following the London court ruling today, BALPA has confirmed the planned strike by UK pilots employed by 
Ryanair will go ahead.
“Ryanair foolishly tried to stop our strike in the High Court today and failed," says BALPA general secretary Brian 
Strutton. "Despite that, we extended an olive branch to Ryanair as a way of getting back around the table and 
calling off strikes over the next two days.
"We are extremely disappointed that Ryanair have taken such a belligerent and negative stance. We have become 
used to their macho posturing, but sadly it is their passengers who will pay the price for Ryanair’s attitude.”
Ryanair in its own statement says that "thanks to the great work and volunteerism of the vast majority of our UK 
based pilots," it now expects to operate its full schedule of flights to/from our UK airports.
While it says it does not expect significant disruptions on 22 August or 23 August, Ryanair adds it cannot rule out 
"small flight delays" and/or flight changes. "We are working hard with our pilot teams to minimise any such delays 
for our customers and their families," it says.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair has lost a High Court bid in London to block strikes by its U.K. pilots but succeed in court 
action against Irish pilots.
Judge Christina Lambert rejected the airline's urgent application Wednesday for an injunction against the British 
Airline Pilots' Association. That means a strike authorized for Thursday and Friday will go forward, with a second 
round set for September.
Pilots based in the U.K. have authorized strikes this week in a dispute with the budget carrier over pay and benefits.
Lambert's decision came after Ryanair succeeded at the High Court in Dublin to prevent pilots based in Ireland from 
going on a 48-hour strike from midnight on Thursday.
Members of the British Airline Pilots Association voted for strikes set for Aug. 22-23 and Sept. 2-4.

LISBON, Portugal (AP) - A strike by Portuguese cabin crew working for budget airline Ryanair is causing little 
impact, with only some minor delays reported.
Portugal's National Union of Civil Aviation Cabin Crew called the five-day walkout beginning Wednesday to protest 
what it alleges is Ryanair's non-compliance with Portuguese labor laws, including holiday pay and days off.
The airline switched many passengers to other flights before the strike, and the Portuguese government enacted a 
law forcing the cabin crew to work on a stipulated number of flights because the walkout came during the busy 
summer vacation period and could have caused chaos.
Ryanair pilots based in Britain plan a walkout Thursday over pay and benefits, and Spanish cabin crew are due to 
hold a 10-day strike in September over job cuts.

The Irish High Court on Wednesday granted Ryanair an injunction to prevent its Dublin-based pilots from going on 
strike later this week.
Ryanair went to court to obtain an order against Forsa, the parent body of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association 
(IALPA), to prevent the Dublin-based pilots from striking for 48 hours on Thursday and Friday.
On Wednesday, Ryanair's legal counsel told the High Court that Forsa had not allowed for the mediation process to 
be completed before announcing the strike and claimed the strike would be in breach of an agreement made 
between the airline and the union last year.

Ryanair expects its flights from Ireland to operate as normal on 24 and 25 August after an Irish High Court 
judgement today preventing a planned 48h stoppage by pilots.
In a tweet, Ryanair says it welcomes the ruling and has called on pilots represented by the Forsa union to return to 
mediation.
Forsa members had earlier this month voted in favour of the strike, one of several industrial threats hanging over 
the pan-European budget carrier this summer.
Ryanair has similarly applied for a court injunction to block strike action planned for the same days by UK pilots 
represented by the BALPA union. A ruling is still pending from today's hearing.
BALPA had earlier accused the carrier of missing the opportunity to resolve the dispute with UK pilots by seeking 
the injunction.
"Ryanair pilots in the UK have a serious dispute with their company which will not be resolved by raising legal 
technicalities in the High Court," said BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton. "It means all the time that could have 
been used to try to find a resolution will now be spent preparing for the court action."

 Only a dozen airlines will eventually share the aviation market for major international routes, predicted the chief 
executive officer of Lufthansa AG, while a possible future economic crisis could "accelerate" a consolidation in air 
travel.
"The sector is evolving towards a dozen companies operating worldwide" on major international routes, in addition 
to smaller national or regional airlines, Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr told reporters late Monday.
Without naming them, Spohr forecasted there would be "three in the US, three in China, three in the Gulf and three 
in Europe".
The Lufthansa chief executive warned that any future economic crisis could hit European airlines particularly hard, 
but predicted a downturn could "accelerate" mergers and acquisitions.
The recent bankruptcies of German low-cost airlines Air Berlin and Germania have enabled Lufthansa to buy back 
flight routes and aircraft.
The airline industry is "much more cyclical" and at the mercy of economic developments than others, Spohr said, 
with the sector suffering from international trade tensions.
Lufthansa wants to "and will play an active role" in any future consolidation in the sector, said the airline boss, 
whose company's net profit dropped by 70% in the second quarter.
Spohr said Lufthansa faced strong competition from low-cost airlines in a "unique price war", however "we will not 
be driven out of our domestic market" by low-cost companies such as Ryanair Holdings PLC, because the German 
airline "has the financial strength to resist" competition.

The head of German airline Lufthansa, Carsten Spohr, said the aviation industry needs to slow down its growth and 
stop pushing forward with fare wars, and instead invest in more efficient and better quality air travel.
Speaking in Frankfurt late Monday, Spohr criticized the "unique fare war" that was waged on the Austrian and 
German market for short distance flights this summer, without explicitly naming competitor Ryanair, which is known 
for its extremely low fares.
"Five-euro (5.5-dollar) tickets don't only clog up the system, they also make us more vulnerable to criticism - and 
the many sustainable things we do as an industry are put into question," he said.
Spohr said Lufthansa stood by its responsibility as regards climate change and that it was constantly investing in 
newer, more efficient aircraft.
The airline chief also said long-distance flights would continue to be powered by fossil fuels in the future, but that jet 
fuel could be created synthetically if a climate-neutral primary energy source was available.
Spohr said the aviation tax paid by airlines and airports should be used to conduct research that would benefit the 
industry.

Aug 20, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Unions 
representing Ryanair cabin crew in Spain warned on Tuesday of a 10-day strike in September to protest against the 
anticipated closing of some airport bases for the low-cast Irish airline.After meeting with Ryanair representatives for 
more than seven hours, "which ended without an accord," the unions USO and Sitcpla issued a warning of a strike 
at 13 Ryanair bases in Spain, the USO said in a statement.It said the protest was over the possible closing of 
Ryanair bases at airports on the popular tourist Canary islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria and also the "future 
uncertainty" for Girona in northeast Spain.More meetings between unions and Ryanair management could be held 
next week, USO said. 
Cabin crew are set to observe the strike mainly on Fridays and Sundays in September.Ryanair had announced last 
month that it would close some bases because of problems with Boeing's crisis-hit 737 MAX jet, which has been 
grounded after two fatal accidents.The Irish no-frills airline said it expected to take delivery of just 30 Boeing 737 
MAX 200 jets by the end of May 2020, instead of the 58 that it originally expected, and shortfall would mean it 
would have to close some bases.Ryanair also announced in July that it intends to eliminate 900 jobs in its 13,000-
strong workforce, and it has faced several protests by employees in Europe.Pilots in the UK and Ireland warned of 
strikes in August and September to protest against their working conditions and salaries.

Every August, a group of geographically diverse airline managements gather in Montana for an annual review. They 
have a couple of things in common: they are all from low-cost carriers and each one has scored the support of 
Indigo Partners.
There, amid the state's snow-capped mountains and green valleys, the senior executives discuss their businesses 
and try to learn from one another in order to improve their individual airlines.
This is all orchestrated by Indigo founder William A "Bill" Franke, the man often credited with creating the ultra-low-
cost carrier model, along with Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
BillyPix
While investors such as Warren Buffett have stayed away from aviation, burned by its endless inefficiencies, Franke 
ran straight into the fire, realising that there was money to be made. And he could be the most influential aviation 
investor of his time.
Through his private equity fund Indigo Partners, which he founded in 2002, Franke has been associated with nearly 
a dozen airlines.
Acting behind the scenes, Franke has been responsible for the proliferation of ultra-low-cost carriers all over the 
world. Indigo's portfolio includes, or has at some point included: Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Volaris and Wizz 
Air.
There is a simple formula to getting it right in aviation, according to Franke: it comes down to cost.
INTERVIEW: Indigo Partners founder Bill Franke Every August, a group of geographically diverse airline 
managements gather in Montana for an annual review. They ....
"We're pretty careful about managing the model," he says. "It boggles the mind what airline managements are 
inclined to do. At the end of the day, all of us want to own an airline we want to fly. And sometimes that's not the 
airline the public needs."
OUTSIDER VIEW
Perhaps it was precisely this outsider view that the US airline industry needed when Franke entered the sector in 
the 1990s.
His roots are in forest products – specifically paper. He was chief executive of Southwest Forest Industries – a 
Fortune 500 company – before his 40th birthday. This is where he learned how critical it is to have the lowest cost 
in the market.
"I had to figure out how to produce it [paper products] at a lower cost," says Franke. "That was in my DNA."
Having restructured Southwest Forest Industries, he went on to serve as chairman of the executive committee of 
the board of Valley National Bank, the largest bank in Arizona at the time (and now part of JPMorgan) to oversee its 
management overhaul. This helped to build his credentials as a successful restructurer.
In 1993, after taking on the chairmanship at Circle K, one of the largest convenience store chains in the USA, 
Franke was ready for his next challenge.
In a somewhat unconventional manner, the governor of Arizona called Franke, a successful chief executive in his 
fifties, and asked him to save his state's airline. This is how Franke entered the aviation sector, for a sojourn that 
has lasted more than thirty years.
"I said I'd stay six months and I stayed nine years," he recalls.
BillyPix
When Franke joined America West, the airline was in crisis. It came down to Franke to restructure the business, 
which was already in bankruptcy and failing amid strong competition from Dallas-based low-cost carrier Southwest 
Airlines on nearly 40% of its routes. The creditors had already filed to liquidate the company's assets.
During the first few months of his tenure at the airline, Franke began to slash costs. Six months later, the airline was 
cashflow positive, which Franke attributes to reducing costs and increasing revenue.
"There's an argument that an economy seat is an economy seat is an economy seat," Franke says, acknowledging 
that safety and schedule are also factors in choosing an airline.
He transformed the carrier into a low-cost operator and would lead the business from 1993 until 2001.
By the time he left in 2001, America West had the highest EBITDAR margin in the industry. It was during his years 
at the carrier that Franke says he learned how important efficiency and cost structure are to the success of an 
airline.
"That model has been consistently what we've installed in each of those carriers," says Franke of his airline 
investments over the past two decades.
It was off the successes at America West that in 2002 Franke established Indigo Partners, his private equity firm 
that invests in low-cost carriers.
RECORD DEAL
Indigo holds the record for the largest single aircraft order ever placed.
INTERVIEW: Indigo Partners founder Bill Franke Every August, a group of geographically diverse airline 
managements gather in Montana for an annual review. They ....
In November 2017, Franke cemented his aviation legacy, signing a memorandum of understanding for 430 Airbus 
A320neos at the Dubai air show. It was firmed a month later. The jets will be divided between Frontier, Volaris, 
Wizz and Chilean start-up JetSmart.
It was during one of the annual August retreats in Montana that Franke realised he could gain leverage in 
negotiations with Airbus through a bulk order.
At the time, Airbus was going through management changes, with commercial head John Leahy retiring, while 
Boeing was already adjusting to new management.
"They [the OEMs] were willing to engage with Indigo – which, typically, would be passed to its portfolio airlines," 
says Franke. "And it was a groundbreaking concept."
(More recently, in June at the Paris air show, IAG followed a similar strategy, committing to 200 Boeing 737 Max 
jets, which it will divide between its portfolio airlines.)
With such a large order, Indigo – or rather its airlines – was able to gain pricing advantage over lessors.
By securing slots for the most in-demand aircraft, Indigo ensured it achieved a good deal for narrowbodies, which it 
will sell to lessors and lease back at competitive market rates. Through these sale-and-leasebacks, Indigo expects 
its airlines to generate additional cashflows when they sell the jets at a profit to what Indigo paid.
"[The lessors] can't match our pricing," Franke says. "They'll pay us more than [we paid for] the aircraft, which 
creates incremental cash flow."
For instance, in Wizz Air's 2019 annual report, the carrier identifies credits "totalling 44.5m relating to various 
aircraft asset sale-and-leaseback transactions and certain supplier contract negotiations".
Several other airlines, such as Ryanair and Indian low-cost operator IndiGo (which is not an Indigo Partners airline), 
have operated a similar model: buying in bulk at a discounted price, then funding via sale-and-leasebacks in which 
they sell the jet for more than they paid.
COST REDUCTION
Everything Franke does comes down to cost reduction to improve the bottom line: getting aircraft cheap, slashing 
inefficient costs, charging passengers ancillary fees, and so on.
The fund's internal rate of return hurdle is 25%, and Franke says Indigo has exceeded that figure to date.
"I didn't know we were going to have those kinds of returns," he says. "But I was hopeful we'd have returns that 
outstripped the market."
While Franke admits that it is hard to sustain such impressive returns, he says that Wizz and Frontier – Indigo's 
longest holds – are both performing well.
Since Indigo invested in 2013, Frontier has continued to profit, with an average net margin of 13.5%, while Wizz has 
had an average net income margin of 12.2% for the same period.
BillyPix
Earlier this year, Indigo was in negotiations with Icelandic carrier Wow Air to take a stake in the failing carrier.
The firm had proposed to invest $75 million in the airline, which it subsequently raised to $90 million, before walking 
away from the deal. Nearly a month later, Wow ceased operations.
INTERVIEW: Indigo Partners founder Bill Franke Every August, a group of geographically diverse airline 
managements gather in Montana for an annual review. They ....
At the moment, Indigo is working to get its Canadian ultra-low-cost carrier Enerjet, focused on visiting friends and 
relatives traffic between the USA and Canada, up and running. Indigo closed its investment in the carrier at the end 
of 2018, after Canada relaxed restrictions of foreign ownership of airlines in 2016.
Franke confirms that Indigo has an air operator's certificate for the carrier and is in the process of completing its 
management team. Operations of the yet-to-be-named airline are expected to begin by the first half of 2020.
Indigo is always hunting for new opportunities. One market that the company has not yet ventured into is Brazil.
"It is a market that at some point we will take an interest in," notes Franke, who spent some of his childhood in 
Brazil.
He describes the country as a "very complicated" market, for reasons including that it speaks a different language 
to the rest of Latin America.
"[Brazil] has had economic swings recently that mean you have to be thoughtful about your timing," says Franke, 
adding that the government is keen for another low-cost airline to enter the market. "They recently changed the 
laws so you can own 100% of a Brazilian airline, which is very helpful."
In June, the nation's president Jair Bolsonaro signed into law the removal of all restrictions on foreign ownership of 
Brazilian airlines. Foreign investors are now allowed to own 100% of domestic carriers, with the sole condition that 
local personnel must operate the aircraft. Until the change in the law, foreign ownership of Brazilian airlines had 
been limited to 20%.
But whether or not Indigo enters new markets, Franke is confident in the potential of its existing investments.
"Our own view is that all the markets we serve have significant growth in front of them," says Franke. "The [aircraft] 
order reflects a confidence in the marketplace," he adds, referring to the 430-aircraft order Indigo placed in Dubai.
Currently, Indigo has airlines operating in South America, Mexico, eastern Europe and the USA, all of which Franke 
says are growth markets for the ultra-low-cost model – but some with more space for expansion than others.
UNTAPPED POTENTIAL
Unlike in Europe, where the low-cost model has proliferated to cover a large proportion the market, in the USA 
there is still plenty of room to expand operations, says Franke.
"Look at what's happened in Europe with Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air – they have something approaching 40% of 
domestic traffic. In the USA a comparable number is 7-10% – so we have a long way to go."
Frontier has seen its revenue per passenger increase by double-digit percentages since 2014. Most recently, it 
announced it would launch routes from Phoenix, taking on American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Southwest.
BillyPix
Mexico-based Volaris meanwhile focuses on visiting-friends-and-relatives traffic between the USA and Mexico, one 
of Latin America's biggest markets.
Franke notes that geopolitics between the USA and Mexico have led to a depressed peso, hurting all operators in 
the market.
"The fact is, Volaris has the lowest cost in the market and is now the largest airline in the market. It's just a question 
to get the stock to respond to the improving Mexican economy."
One of Indigo's recent projects was the launch of Chilean ultra-low-cost carrier JetSmart in 2017. The airline has 
continued to grow its footprint, winning rights to operate internationally around South America.

The carrier's tagline is: "Flying smart is flying more and paying less." It is exactly this ethos that Franke has 
deposited in the psyche of the flying community. And since 1993, he's been a master of identifying passengers' 
needs for economical transportation.
At 82 years of age, Franke is still hunting for investment opportunities as he continues to shape the industry, paying 
careful attention to what the travelling public needs and applying decades-worth of leadership to helping

UK pilots' union hits out Ryanair 's 'time wasting' bid to block strike
UK pilots' union hits out Ryanair's 'time wasting' bid to block strike

BRITAIN's airline pilot union has blasted Ryanair for seeking a High Court injunction to block strike action by its 
pilots this week.
The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said the budget flyer had "wasted time" by trying to use "legal 
technicalities" to persuade the High Court to block a strike due to take place on Thursday and Friday.
"Balpa invited Ryanair to join them at talks this week but the airline refused," the union said.
General secretary Brian Strutton said: "Ryanair pilots in the UK have a serious dispute with their company which 
will not be resolved by raising legal technicalities in the High Court.
"[Ryanair's] attempt to block lawful strike action is just another demonstration of the bullying tactics the airline 
appears to favour.
"It means all the time that could have been used to try to find a resolution will now be spent preparing for the court 
action."
A Ryanair spokesperson said: "Balpa, who represent a small number of highly paid UK pilots, should not be 
disrupting the return holiday flights of UK families later this week when Ryanair captains already earn £180,000 per 
annum and are now seeking unjustified pay increases of between 65 per cent to 121 per cent."
Strikes are also planned for a second round of dates in September.

Aug 20, 2019( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Only a dozen airlines will 
eventually share the aviation market for major international routes, predicts Lufthansa's CEO, while a possible 
future economic crisis could "accelerate" a consolidation in air travel."The sector is evolving towards a dozen 
companies operating worldwide" on major international routes, in addition to smaller national or regional airlines, 
Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr told reporters late Monday.Without naming them, Spohr forecast there would be 
"three in the United States, three in China, three in the Gulf and three in Europe".The Lufthansa chief executive 
warned that any future economic crisis could hit European airlines particularly hard, but predicted a downturn could 
"accelerate" mergers and acquisitions."If there is one positive aspect to the flattening of the global economy, and 
certainly also the worsening figures for all airlines -- unfortunately also for us -- it is that the consolidation process 
will tend to accelerate," Spohr added.The recent bankruptcies of German low-cost airlines Air Berlin and Germania 
have enabled Lufthansa to buy back flight routes and aircraft.The airline industry is "much more cyclical" and at the 
mercy of economic developments than others, Spohr said, with the sector suffering from international trade 
tensions.Lufthansa wants to "and will play an active role" in any future consolidation in the sector, said the airline 
boss, whose company's net profit dropped by 70 percent in the second quarter.Spohr said Lufthansa faced strong 
competition from low-cost airlines in a "unique price war", however "we will not be driven out of our domestic 
market" by low-cost companies like Ryanair, because the German airline "has the financial strength to resist" 
competition.

The Lifetime Isa: three ways to invest A properly diversified portfolio would mitigate the risks in an economic 
downturn (also remembering that the FTSE 100 increased 60 per cent during 2009) and would recover eventually 
during this time. Regular contributions to a diversified portfolio is key to success. - AJM, via www.FT.com Sterling 
takes a pounding If sterling effectively falls by one third from pre-referendum to post hard Brexit that will increase 
consumer costs by about 6 per cent with no commensurate increase in income. That will worsen as government 
income will be the next casualty, so it is easy to see a 10 per cent decline in living standards, of which perhaps 2 
per cent has been felt so far. - Never vote Conservative again, via            www.FT.com Why I'll pay extra for holiday 
travel perks Car hire companies' charges are criminal. All the government has to do it is insist rental companies 
charge actual costs for repairs rather than standard fees (on repairs they never carry out...) and the problem would 
go away. - Stuart mellor, via            www.FT.com Fluffing up a generally poor experience with unnecessary costs 
really doesn't make the core experience any better. It merely justifies your belief in the expense you're paying.
As a Platinum Amex holder I can say I'd rather be at home than in a complimentary lounge and as a BA/SAS flyer 
I'd rather enjoy the more expensive core experience than pay additional fees with Ryanair. - Schnippzle, via 
www.FT.com We were told on our most recent hire that we would be charged extra if we returned the car 30 
minutes early.
When asked why, they said - with a very straight face - because we lost money as we could have hired your car to 
someone else. - JAFA, via www.FT.com "Premium" queue jumping is stressful because half the plane will have 
made the same calculation as you. - Fabricew, via            www.FT.com Inheritance tax: what does the future hold? 
Testators should exercise considerable caution before appointing an accountantcy, lawyer, surveying firm or the 
like to be executors.
READERS WRITE
Executors cannot be removed following the death of the testator and some of these firms charge hundreds of 
pounds per hour, plus Vat.
Executors should take advice from these firms,as needed or required, for specific advice for an agreed fee. - DR 
Sedley, via email Broadband: what price a reliable connection? I suggest you switch mobile network to one that has 
4G coverage in your home. Ofcom has a good postcode checker tool. Get a Sim and pop it in your existing 
handset. - Neymar, via www.FT.com What bizarre paranoia: a compulsion to check one's bank account daily in 
case there is fraud is not normal. - CremeBrullle, via            www.FT.com Money rarely compensates for loss. We 
all want reliable high-speed internet connections, but that comes at a huge cost. The project needs funds and a 
national plan. We need a government prepared to reorder its priorities and put a vast amount of capital into the 
project. - Citymoose, via            www.FT.com

Ryanair expects minimal disruption from planned strikes

Ryanair expects minimal cancellations with affected passengers flying out at different times if pilots in Britain 
and Ireland go ahead with a two-day strike next week, the airline's chief people officer said on Thursday.
Ryanair staff unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have announced plans to strike in the coming weeks, a 
year after an initial wave of strikes over pay and conditions forced it to cancel hundreds of flights and hit its profits.
Members of its British pilot union, which the airline said represents half of its pilots there, voted last week to stage a 
two-day strike from Aug. 22, when directly employed pilots in Ireland also plan a strike.
Unionized Irish pilots represent less than half of Ryanair's pilots in its home market.
"Our hope is that we're going to cover the majority of the operation both in the UK and Ireland, and unless you hear 
from us, your flight is going ahead as normal," Eddie Wilson told Reuters in a telephone interview, adding that 
planned action by Portuguese cabin crew next week would be minor.
"We'll be protecting as a priority the summer destinations and there may be some cancellations on multi-frequency 
routes between Ireland, the UK or on UK domestics where people can make free changes, etc. There will not be 
travel chaos."
 
"OFF THE WALL"
Ryanair expects minimal disruption from planned strikes
Responding to the British Airline Pilots Association's call on Thursday to meet for mediated talks to resolve the 
dispute on pay and benefits, Wilson said Ryanair was still waiting on the union to reply to a legal letter stating it had 
to re-engage directly first, as per a deal struck last year.
Mediated talks broke down on Wednesday in Ireland, where a series of one-day strikes last year were quelled when 
concerns on transfers and promotions when settled.
Wilson said on Thursday that subsequent union claims for increases in total earnings of between 57% and 101% for 
some pilots were "off the wall," particularly at a time when "the world is falling apart aviation-wise."
Asked if there had been any impact on bookings, Wilson said that while talk of strikes could worry some potential 
customers, the holiday season of August is the time of the year where the airline has its highest number of advance 
bookings.
He also confirmed reports from unions that Ryanair is likely to close its base in Faro and two in the Canary Islands 
as part of plans to cut is presence on the ground in airports due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 
737 MAX.
A final decision has yet to be made on how many bases, jobs and routes will be cut as a result, Wilson added.

Airline Staff Were 'Disinterested' As Drunk Passenger Grabbed Emergency Exit Door Mid-Air
Airline Staff Were 'Disinterested' As Drunk Passenger Grabbed Emergency

Aug 16, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
passengers recently had a terrifying experience after a man grabbed the emergency exit door mid-air and vomited 
all over himself. The incident took place aboard a Ryanair flight from Manchester, England, to Tenerife, Spain, 
earlier this month.Speaking to Sun Online on Wednesday[1], 47-year-old Alan Wild said he was with his girlfriend 
and stepson when the drunk passenger boarded the flight."We could hear some commotion going on at the front 
door...basically this guy got on the plane and was hammered. He got to the door and he was swearing at the cabin 
crew at the top of his voice to the point where my 11-year-old stepson commented on how drunk he was. 
He was telling them to p--- off and was being abusive and loud. But they didn't stop him boarding the plane,' he 
said.Things got worse when the unidentified passenger carelessly started walking on the emergency exit 
aisle."Some other passengers called a steward and said he shouldn't be sat there...this guy couldn't even put his 
seat belt on. If you read the emergency exit conditions, a legal requirement, you've got to be mobile, not hammered 
and in full control. But the cabin crew weren't interested. They kept telling everyone 'if it escalates, we will deal with 
it'. So, we went along with that,' Wild said.A while later, the passenger vomited on himself."You can imagine the 
smell. I saw his bag open...he had consumed three quarters of a bottle of whisky. The cabin crew left him covered 
in vomit for about 20 minutes. He was unable to deal with it himself, his friend was trying to sort him out. He then 
sat there spitting on the floor and hanging off the emergency exit door. His arms were all over it. Everyone was sat 
there thinking 'what is going on here'? Everyone was very frightened. Everyone within a 10-seat radius was well 
aware of the situation. It was awful,' he added.Upon reaching Spain, the drunk passenger was helped off the flight 
while all the other passengers were asked to wait in a hot shuttle bus for over 20 minutes.In a statement to Sun 
Online, a customer service representative for the airline said, "For the safety and comfort of our customers and

A TRADE union yesterday urged Ryanair to attend talks to resolve the current dispute with its pilots over pay and 
working conditions.
The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), which has more than 10,000 members, has called on the budget 
airline to attend talks with the Acas conciliation service after pilots voted for strike action for Thursday 22 August 
and Monday 2 September.
Balpa recently held an industrial ballot of UK-based Ryanair pilots in which 80 per cent voted in favour of industrial 
action on a turnout of 72 per cent. The dispute centres on issues such as pensions, maternity benefit, allowances 
and pay.

Ryanair's directly employed pilots in Ireland will strike for 48 hours next week, the Irish pilots' union Forsa/IALPA 
said on Wednesday, after mediated talks failed to bring an agreement with the company over the union's pay 
proposals.
To prevent a strike on Aug. 22-23, Ryanair management had needed to make a counter-proposal by Aug. 14 that 
properly addressed all areas of the union's claim, Forsa/IALPA had demanded.
"No such counter-proposal was made at the mediation meeting today," Forsa/IALPA said in a statement.
Ryanair has called on its pilots and the union to return to the mediation with proposals that take falling airfares and 
company profits into consideration, the airline said in a separate statement.
"We have done everything in our power to avoid disruption to our flights and our customers' holidays. However, no 
company can concede to grossly unreasonable demands from its highest paid workers... at a time when the airline 
industry is in crisis," said Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson.
Pilots in the Forsa/IALPA trade union voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action last week after accusing 
Ryanair of stalling on talks since pay demands were submitted in late March.
Europe's largest budget airline suffered a number of strikes a year ago after a rocky start to its move to recognise 
unions for the first time, and it is now also facing strike action from its cabin crew in Spain over the company's plans 
to close several bases in the country. (Reuters)

Highlight: A series of internal and external challenges faced by Ryanair comes on top of the announcement of 
disappointing results.
Body
The low-cost carrierÂ recently reported quarterly profits of EUR243m ($272m) in Q1 FY2019, a 21% drop 
compared to the previous year. Fuel costs increases and a 6% fall in average fares may explain these 
unsatisfactory results. This might be theÂ beginning of some tough times for the Irish airline, which is already 
embroiled in the Boeing 737 Max crisis and tricky HR issues. 
The company must now take action to limit the damage. Effective negotiations with its personnel and smart 
handling of the 737 Max difficulties would be a good start.Â But Ryanair also has to work on its brand image if it is 
to prevent current issues from affecting the company's long-term profitability. Pilot strikes are another black mark on 
the reputation of the carrierDisagreements regarding pensions, insurance, benefits and the pay structure 
betweenÂ management and its British pilots recently led the latter to call for five days of action in August and 
September. Irish personnelÂ have also indicated their intention to go on strike, while Spanish and Portuguese 
crews are likely to follow in their footsteps after announcing potential disruptions. GivenÂ the carrier faces fierce 
competition in terms of fares and level of service, having disgruntled employees could damage its image further in 
the eyes of the public and potentially lead to a loss in market share. The grounding of Boeing 737 MaxÂ aircraft is 
yet another crisis to be managed for Ryanair. The airline's declining fortunes have occurred amidÂ a reduction in 
the number of operating bases alongside plans to cut 900 jobs by next winter. Much of this is due to the delayed 
delivery of 135 Boeing 737 Max aircraft. Indeed, this model experienced two crashes that resulted in its worldwide 
grounding. It is hard to blame Ryanair for building itsÂ fleet from a range of aircraft that made economic sense, 
allowing it to drastically reduce its training and maintenance expenses at the same time. However,Â the Ryanair 
should ensure its current problems are better managed than in 2017 when it saw thousands of flights cancelled due 
to poor HR planning. AlthoughÂ CEO Michael O'Leary will attempt to use the negative publicity to the advantage of 
the airline, the extent of competition and signs of disaffection from the public keep growing. It would be ill-advised 
for the carrier to take its leading position for granted.

Ryanair's directly employed pilots in Ireland agreed to attend mediated talks starting on Wednesday to avert a strike 
their trade union said would go ahead next week if the airline does not properly address a pay claim.
Europe's largest budget airline suffered a number of strikes a year ago after a rocky start to its move to recognize 
unions for the first time, and is under pressure again with pilots in its home market threatening to join cabin crew in 
Portugal and pilots in Britain on the picket line this month.
Irish pilots who are members of the Forsa/IALPA trade union voted overwhelmingly in favor of industrial action on 
Friday after accusing Ryanair of stalling on talks since pay demands were submitted in late March.
About a quarter of Ryanair's 350 pilots in Ireland staged a series of one-day strikes this time last year before 
concerns on transfers and promotions were settled. The talks on Wednesday will be overseen by the same 
mediator who brokered that deal.
"A substantive and meaningful counter-proposal from Ryanair management, which properly addresses all areas of 
the union’s claim, would need to be tabled tomorrow to prevent strike action next week," Forsa/IALPA said in a 
statement on Tuesday.
Members of Ryanair's British pilots union will stage the first of two multi-day strikes on Aug. 22, a day after 
Portuguese cabin crew are due to begin five days of action. Pilots in Spain are also considering a walk out.
Ryanair managed to quell last year's disputes by reaching deals with many unions in Europe on pay and 
allowances, but it has yet to move beyond recognition agreements with others and further angered staff by 
informing them two weeks ago that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed. (Reuters)

Norwegian Air Shuttle is scaling back its transatlantic ambitions as the struggling low-cost airline ends its services 
between Ireland and the US.
Norwegian said yesterday that it would cease flying from Dublin, Cork and Shannon to the US and Canada from 
September 15.
It blamed the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft after two fatal crashes for making the routes "no longer 
commercially viable".
It marks the first big retreat from Norwegian's rapid and expensive push into long-haul. The airline had hoped to 
shake up the sector by using planes such as the 737 Max and Boeing's Dreamliner to fly to lesser-known US 
destinations from regional European airports.
Under pressure from investors worried that its expansion could bring collapse, Norwegian has reversed course in 
recent months, saying it will no longer prioritise growth but will aim for better profitability. It raised fresh capital and 
replaced its chief executive and chairman.
"We take a strict approach to route management and constantly evaluate route performance to ensure we meet 
customer demand," said Matthew Wood, senior vice-president for longhaul commercial.
Norwegian transatlantic flights from Ireland axed Airlines
"Compounded by the global grounding of the 737 Max and the continued uncertainty of its return to service, this has 
led us to make the difficult decision to discontinue all six routes from Dublin, Cork and Shannon to the US and 
Canada."
Norwegian said it was in negotiations with pilots and cabin crew in Dublin "to ensure that redundancies remain a 
last resort". It will continue to fly to Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen from the Irish capital.
The airline, Europe's third-largest low-cost airline behind Ryanair and EasyJet, has also suffered technical issues 
on its long-distance routes.
