Riga-Berlin route shows biggest growth at Riga airport in 2016
RIGA, Jan 30, BNS - Last year compared to 2015, Riga-Berlin route showed the biggest growth by 84.7 percent at 
the Riga airport, representatives of International Airport Riga reported.
Compared to 2015, last year also a significant growth was recorded in routes from Riga to St.Petersburg (+42.8 
percent), Kiev (+20.7 percent), Moscow (+18.5 percent), Stockholm (+10.3 percent), Amsterdam (+9.8 percent), 
Tallinn (+ 9.3 percent), Milan (+8.8 percent) and London (+8.3 percent).
London, Moscow, Oslo, Frankfurt and Helsinki are still the most popular destinations for passengers travelling from 
Riga Airport.
In 2016, the number of transfer/transit passengers rose by 15.3 percent and accounted for 27.3 percent of the total 
number of passengers handled last year, thus demonstrating the important role of Riga Airport as a regional transit 
hub in the Baltics. Tallinn, Vilnius, Moscow, Helsinki and St.Petersburg were the most popular transit destinations 
travelling via Riga Airport, said the airport's board chairwoman Ilona Lice.
Of the total number of passengers, more than 50 percent were carried by the national airline airBaltic, 18.3 percent 
- by Ryanair, and 8.5 percent - by WizzAir.
“Growth figures show that the targeted business strategy of Riga Airport has brought good results. Airport's last 
year's extensive investment in the modernisation of the aerodrome infrastructure, expanding the passenger terminal 
and offering new services and facilities for passengers, has raised the Airport's competitiveness and created a 
favourable business environment for airlines, also for the development of the strategically important long-distance 
flights. The task for the coming years is to develop the infrastructure for promoting growth of passenger and cargo 
traffic, to make Riga Airport the leader not only in the Baltic countries, but in the entire Baltic Sea Region," says 
Lice.
Riga-Berlin route shows biggest growth at Riga airport in 2016
Airport's Ground Handling Department (RIX GH), which provides ground handling services to the majority of 
passenger airlines, air cargo carriers and part of business aviation aircraft operating at Riga Airport, reached a new 
punctuality record of 99.92 percent, which is among the highest rates in Europe.
The number of destinations from Riga Airport will keep increasing also in 2017, offering new flights to nine 
destinations: Tampere, Aberdeen, Stavanger, Geneva, Catania, Gothenburg, Odessa, Madrid and Copenhagen. 
This will allow the Airport to attract new passengers, strengthening its leading position in the region, improving the 
connections of the three Baltic States to Western European and Eastern markets, facilitating economic growth and 
creating new jobs.
The new North Pier was the most significant infrastructure project in 2016. It is a continuation for the ambitious 
Airport infrastructure development projects aimed at raising passenger comfort and the quality of services offered to 
both travellers and business partners. The new pier is placed on two floors offering 19 new boarding sectors, three 
airbridges, new stores and cafés, playgrounds for children, as well as a spacious and comfortable waiting area.
The total area of the North Pier is 9,828.39 m2, but together with the premises for arriving passengers and the 
gallery connecting the terminals built in the 1st stage - 17,340 m2.
In 2017 and in the coming years, Riga Airport will continue work on the development of the terminal building, 
expanding the check-in hall, the baggage claim and sorting areas, security control area, as well as constructing a 
multi-storey car park and a connection to the Rail Baltica Riga Airport station. As reported before, the memorandum 
signed by Rail Baltica project promoter Eiropas Dzelzcela Linijas and Riga International Airport this summer 
provides that construction of Rail Baltica RIX station and its full integration within the Airport territory should be 
completed by 2022.
In 2016, Riga Airport also made a significant contribution to uniting the aviation industry. The Airport initiated 
establishment of the Latvian aviation sector cooperation platform – the Aviation Association of Latvia.
As reported, the Riga International Airport served 5.403 million passengers in 2016, which is 4.7 percent more than 
in 2015, according to the airport. In December 2016, 403,303 passengers were served at the airport - 5.7 percent 
up on December 2015.
A total of 68,061 flights were registered at the Riga Airport last year, which is about the same as in 2015. The 
airport's cargo turnover amounted to 19,759 tons, a 4.8 percent increase on 2015. In December, 1,709 tons of 
cargo was handled at the airport, 11.7 percent more than in December 2015.
Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltics, servicing 44 percent of the air passengers in the 
Baltic states. The 20 airlines operating at Riga Airport offer 60 destinations in the winter season and 80 in the 
summer season.

Lithuania turns to EU Court of Justice over place of hearing of flyLAL, AirBaltic dispute
RIGA/VILNIUS, Jan 12, BNS - The European Union's (EU) Court of Justice has been asked to specify whether the 
claim filed by bankrupt company flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines (flyLAL) against Latvia's Air Baltic and the Riga Airport 
can be heard in Lithuanian courts.
The Lithuanian Court of Appeals turned to the Court of Justice in light of the complex procedural circumstances of 
the case, the court said. This is the first time in the court's history when an address is made to the Court of Justice 
for interpretation of the EU law.
After receipt of a conclusion from the Court of Justice, the Lithuanian court will decide whether the case can be 
heard in Lithuania or in Latvia.
flyLAL has asked the court to award damages caused by the possibly unlawful actions of Air Baltic and the Riga 
Airport – a suspected deal to apply lower prices at the Riga airport. flyLAL has said that Air Baltic's predatory pricing 
policies at the Vilnius Airport caused it to be expelled from the flight market.
After about seven years of litigation, a Vilnius court ruled last January that Air Baltic should pay flyLAL 16.121 
million euros in damages. The Riga Airport was cleared of charges.
In 2006, Latvia's competition watchdog found that the discount system at the Riga Airport distorted the market and 
benefited two companies, namely, Air Baltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

Estonia: Tallinn airport serves more than 2.2 mln passengers in 2016
TALLINN, Jan 05, BNS – The airport of Tallinn served more than 2.2 million passengers in 2016, the highest 
number ever.
In December some 160,000 passengers passed through the Tallinn airport, 19 percent more than the year before. 
The yearly passenger number was 2.5 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier, the airport operator 
Tallinna Lennujaam said.
Marketing director Eero Pargmae said 2016 was a positive year in aviation globally primarily thanks to low fuel 
prices. "In addition, in Estonia competition among carriers tightened, which resulted in more flights with lower 
prices, and that was what drove the increase in passenger numbers last year," he said.
"The new years is characterized by preparation for the EU presidency and added connections to London and 
Hamburg. We hope to increase the passenger number by at least 5 percent this year," Pargmae added.
In terms of regular flights, the past year got off to an unsteady beginning owing to the changed market situation 
after the replacement of the domestic carrier. In September both the national flag carrier Nordica as well as SAS 
and Finnair increased the number of flights, which brought about a clear upward trend in passenger flows. The 
number of seats on regular flights grew 4 percent and the number of passengers 4.8 percent from the previous 
year. The average load factor was 68 percent.
Aviation trends were markedly affected by the global security situation as well last year. As a result, Greece 
unseated Turkey as the most preferred holiday destination, and Egypt, Morocco and Cyprus were replaced by 
Bulgaria, Italy and Croatia as popular vacation destinations. The overall number passengers on charter flights fell 
14 percent over the year.
Estonia : Tallinn airport serves more than 2.2 mln passengers in 2016
The Tallinn airport offered regular flights to 23 destinations throughout last year. Seasonal flights included, the 
number of destinations increased to 34 in the summer. The most popular destinations were Frankfurt, Helsinki and 
Riga. Nordica had the biggest number of passengers, followed by airBaltic, Ryanair, Lufthansa and Finnair. Market 
shares of all the major airlines were around 10-15 percent.

Lithuanian airports expects fewer passengers in 2017
VILNIUS, Jan 02, BNS – Lithuanian airports may receive fewer passengers in 2017, as the Vilnius airport will be 
closed for about a month in the summer for repairs. Nevertheless, six new routes will be opened from Lithuania, 
and two will be closed.
"In 2017, consistent growth of the passenger number will continue, however, we will feel a slight decline in July and 
August due to reconstruction of the Vilnius Airport runway. It will be due to the move of Ryanair, the carrier of most 
passengers, as it will not temporarily move its flights to Kaunas. After the project is complete, we will cross the limit 
of 5 million passengers in 2018," Donatas Voveris, network chief at Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports) that 
operates the airports of Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga, said in a press release.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai's CEO Gediminas Almantas has said that the Lithuanian increase in passenger flows over the 
past years has been the fastest among the Baltic states.
According to data provided by the company, passenger numbers should fall by about 4.5 percent to 4.4 million in 
2017, followed by an increase in 2018 that should result in total passenger volume of 5 million people. According to 
preliminary data, passenger flows last year grew by 9.5 percent to 4.6 million people.
Hungary's low-cost airline Wizz Air intends to launch three new routes from Vilnius this year, planning to fly 
passengers to Grenoble, southeastern France, from the beginning of 2017, to Gothenburg, Sweden, starting spring 
and to Warsaw from the fall. Latvia's Air Baltic will launch flights from Vilnius to Paris and Munich at the end of 
March, Ireland's Ryanair will fly from Kaunas to Naples and from Palanga to Glasgow.
Air Baltic intends to stop flying from Vilnius to Stockholm and Scandinavia's SAS will no longer fly to Oslo. The date 
of cancelation of the flights is yet to be announced.

Riga airport agrees to pay fine, end years-long dispute with competition watchdog
RIGA, Dec 9, BNS - The dispute between Riga International Airport and the Latvian Competition Council about 
violations of the competition law that had lasted for several years has finally ended with the airport agreeing to pay 
a fine of EUR 71,144 into the state budget.
The airport's representative, Laura Karnite, said that an administrative contract with the competition watchdog had 
been signed in late November for reasons of procedural economy and to resolve the dispute in the most 
appropriate manner.
The Competition Council confirmed that the dispute had ended with the signing of the administrative contract by 
which the airport recognized distortion of competition and undertook to pay into the state budget a fine of EUR 
71,144.
The Administrative Case Department of the Latvian Supreme Court has closed the dispute between the airport and 
the Competition Council.
In February 2012 the competition watchdog imposed a fine on the Riga airport, saying the airport had breached the 
competition rules without a valid reason by letting the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair to pay much smaller airport fees 
than those charged from the Latvian national airline airBaltic. The airport disagreed and started a litigation.
The airport and airBaltic also battled in the court in relation to the airport fees for several years but finally agreed on 
a settlement to end the dispute.

Reizniece-Ozola 21st in Politico's list of 28 people shaping Europe
RIGA, Dec 7, BNS - Latvian Finance minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola is ranked 21st and Lithuanian President Dalia 
Grybauskaite thirteenth in Politico's list of the 28 people who are shaping, shaking and stirring Europe. London 
Mayor Sadiq Khan is ranked first.
Estonia is not represented in the ranking this year.
Politico's comment about Reizniece-Ozola emphasizes her chess-playing skills and determination to straighten out 
Latvia's finances. Politico also notes that Reizniece-Ozola owes her swift rise in politics to "Latvia's version of 
Donald Trump", Aivars Lembergs, yet the minister tells Politico that she is "nobody's pawn".
Politico reminds that Latvia's governments since independence have a life expectancy of less than two years. 
"Turmoil at the top could see Reizniece-Ozola emerge as a strong candidate for prime minister."
Besides Khan, there are two more mayors included in the ranking: Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau (fifth) and Pristina 
Mayor Shpend Ahmeti (28th).
Second on the list is Frauke Petry, leader of the anti-euro Alternative for Germany party. Ryanair head Michael 
O'Leary is third and former Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski fourth. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is in sixth 
place, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan seventh, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy 
Federica Mogherini eighth, Greek economist Andreas Georgiou ninth, and U.S. billionaire George Soros tenth.
According to Politico, the list is a guide to the people likely to shape 2017 and beyond. These include seventeen 
men and eleven women from 28 different countries - hailing from the worlds of politics, as well as business, media 
and the arts.
Reizniece-Ozola 21st in Politico's list of 28 people shaping Europe
Politico 28 debuted last year with selectees from each of the European Union countries. 28 was chosen more as a 
symbolic than a literal figure - NATO has 28 members too. With Brexit, the EU will soon have one fewer member; 
and with Montenegro slated to join the Alliance, NATO will have one more. Politico 28 will stay at 28, explain 
Politico editors.
"We cast our net widely and solicited nominations from readers. Then editors hashed out - not without a few 
disagreements - this list of the shakers, stirrers and shapers of our world. And then we ranked them in order of their 
impact. Simply holding a powerful public position in a European country didn't guarantee a spot on the list. (So, as 
in 2015, Angela Merkel isn't here)," write Politico editors.
Last year, the headliner was Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. In Politico's view, he was the trendsetter of a 
rising brand of nationalist politics across the Western world that, as it turned out, showed the way for Brexit and 
Donald Trump's stunning triumph. Also last year, former Latvian Prime Minister and current European Commission 
Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis was ranked eighth, TransferWise CEO and co-founder Taavet Hinrikus was in 
17th place, and Lithuanian-Australian businessman and poker player Antanas Guoga 23rd.
Politico is an American political-journalism organization that covers politics and policy in the United States and 
internationally. It distributes content via television, the Internet, The Politico newspaper, radio, and podcasts.

Foreign investors scared by lack of progress
In order to attract investments more successfully, the Latvian government has to do its hometask because just half 
of the large foreign investors plan to continue their investments in Latvia, according to FICIL Sentiment Index 2015-
2016 "Development of the investment climate in Latvia: the viewpoints of foreign investors" presented by the 
Foreign Investors' Council in Latvia (FICIL) on Monday. In the past 12 months the foreign investors do not see any 
improvements in Latvia's business and investment environment despite the efforts of politicians to make it more 
attractive to investors.

Year full of challenges
This year has not been calm for the new and small businesses - several business incubators have been ready by 
the end of the year, while discussions about the microenterprise tax are still tough. Business representatives were 
concerned about the planned changes in the law on mincroenterprise tax and social contributions. Many even went 
out in protests, claiming that the new regulations would mean the end of their business.

Time schedule important
There is a tough competition in the sector or air carriers, and customers choose airlines by their price, said 
professionals surveyed by Diena daily. At prsent 14 airlines are flying from Riga to more than 50 destinations, 
including national carrier airBaltic. Several airlines are offering flights to the same destinations. For example, 
airBaltic, Ryanair and Wizz Air are all flying to London. Also several airlines fly to Stockholm, Oslo and Brussels. 
Transport sector expert Talis Linkaits said that competition affects prices and the low-cost airlines Ryanair and Wizz 
Air play the biggest roles there.

Social exceptions
The Latvian government coalition agreed on Monday to expand the group of people’s to whom the requirement for 
the minimum social contributions rate will not refer. While President Raimonds Vejonis has diverted the bullet fired 
at microenterprises by sending the bill on microenterprise tax back to Saeima for revision, another bill - on state 
social contributions - is being revised by the Saeima social and labor affairs committee. The amendments adopted 
by Saeima earlier stipulate that, from January 1 next year, companies will have to make the minimum social 
contributions for all employees, including those who are paid less than the minimum wage, but now the committee 
is working on expanding the range of social groups to whom this requirement will not refer.

Ryanair to ground Vilnius flights for 2 months next summer
VILNIUS, Nov 02, BNS - Ireland's budget airline Ryanair will ground all of its flights out of Vilnius Airport next July 
and August as the airport will close for a month for runway reconstruction.
The majority of other carriers are planning to temporarily move their flights from Vilnius to Kaunas, some 100 
kilometers from the capital.
"We are not in the position to relocate flights to Kaunas. It will be an interruption of the schedule as it is, but we will 
of course bring the aircraft back the second the airport is back in operation," Matthias Wenk, Ryanair's marketing 
operations director, said in a news conference in Vilnius on Wednesday.
Agne Mazeikyte, spokeswoman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania's three 
major international airports, confirmed to BNS that Ryanair would not operate any flights from Vilnius for two 
months.
"Ryanair will not fly from Vilnius next July through August. This is probably being done for passengers' convenience 
in terms of booking. They have also informed us that their flight schedule in Kaunas Airport will not change during 
the period," she said.
Vilnius Airport's runway reconstruction is scheduled to start on Jul. 14 and be completed on Aug. 18. The majority 
of carriers operating in Vilnius, including Hungary's budget airline Wizz Air, Ryanair's biggest competitor, will 
relocate their flights to Kaunas during that period.

Ireland's Ryanair opens airplane base in Vilnius airport
VILNIUS, Nov 02, BNS – Ireland's low-cost airline Ryanair has opened a new airplane base in Vilnius, keeping two 
of its aircrafts here. It is Ryanair's second base in Lithuania, with two planes held in Kaunas.
Ryanair marketing director Matthias Wenk says expansion plans of the two bases have not yet been clarified.
"In principle, we are working with all airports for growth. We will have to see how everything develops in terms of 
Brexit. We are seeing the change in traffic in UK. We are very interested in developing in this region but it is hard to 
talk about plans for base growth here," Wenk told a Vilnius news conference on Wednesday.
The Vilnius base is Ryanair's 84 th base in Europe. The two airplanes in Vilnius have been purchased for 181.4 
million euros.
In Wenk's words, the company plans on carrying 1.4 million passengers in Lithuania next year.

airBaltic carrier joins Airlines for Europe association
RIGA, Oct 21, BNS - Latvian national carrier airBaltic has joined Europe’s largest airline association, Airlines for 
Europe (A4E), the company informed.
airBaltic CEO Martin Gauss described A4E as the most important association of airlines.
"We are excited to engage with Airlines for Europe - the most important and influential Brussels-based airline 
association - and its member airlines on their way to form a strong, joint group for all airlines in Europe. 
Representing the Eastern European hemisphere, we will deliver new, important insights of smaller but fast growing 
markets within the European Union," said Gauss.
A4E continues to develop and attract new members. The association and its airlines have also been involved 
supporting the ICAO process on a global scheme to address carbon emissions from international aviation.
A4E is Europe’s new and largest airline association, based in Brussels. Launched in January 2016, the association 
consists of Aegean, airBaltic, Air France KLM, easyJet, Finnair, International Airlines Group (IAG), Jet2.com, 
Lufthansa Group, Norwegian, Ryanair, TAP Portugal and Volotea, and plans to grow further.
With more than 550 million passengers on board each year, A4E members account for more than 70 percent of the 
continent’s journeys, operating more than 2,700 airplanes and generating more than EUR 100 billion in annual 
turnover.
As reported, airBaltic closed 2015 with EUR 235.41 million in turnover as compared to EUR 254.17 million a year 
before, while the company’s profit grew to EUR 19.54 million last year from EUR 10.66 million in 2014.
airBaltic, founded in 1995, serves direct flights to about 60 destinations from its home base in Riga.

Latvian citizen in Syrian war
The Security Police last week detained a Latvian citizen on suspicion of participating in the armed conflict in Syria, 
becoming the first person from Latvia to be detained for participating in the Syria conflict. The criminal process 
against this person was initially launched in 2015 for illegally participating in armed conflicts. This summer, the 
Security Police received information from Turkish authorities, who had detained the person. This person was then 
deported back to Latvia earlier this month and taken into custody by local authorities.

PM forced to use cheap plane to fly to Merkel
Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) when making the official visit to Germany at weekend to meet 
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel had to use the low-cost airline Ryanair because tickets with national carrier 
airBaltic turned out to be too expensive. airBaltic spokesman Janis Vanags underscored that the company’s prices 
are competitive, still they are higher if tickets are purchased at the last moment.

Autumn disease - hospital quotas exhausted
Riga's largest hospitals and in some regions patients have to wait for medical consultations until next year. It is not 
unusual to hear from the large hospitals that their quotas for medical services have exhausted. Also this year some 
patients have to put up with a situation that they can have a doctor's appointment only next year. This is a problem 
not only in Latvia's largest hospitals, but also in regions.

Money not to be taken away from language schools
There are 16 schools in Latvia which ensure deeper studies in foreign languages. Financing to these schools is by 
20 percent higher than for other schools, but it is possible that after a two-year transition period this coefficient will 
be cut or taken away. Directors of these schools promise to prove to the Education and Science Ministry that this 
additional money is spent wisely and should be paid also in the future.

PM chooses Ryanair over airBaltic - newspaper
RIGA, Sep 13, BNS - The newspaper Diena reports today that Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis flew to Sunday's 
official meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin not with Latvian national airline airBaltic, but Irish 
low-fare airline Ryanair.
Such a decision was made as airBaltic's ticket fare was too expensive.
The prime minister's press secretary Andrejs Vaivars confirmed the information, and said that there is a simple 
explanation. ''Every year we organize a tender for tourism operators which organize such trips for the State 
Chancellery. We hand them over the information regarding destinations, times and dates, and they find the most 
suitable flights. This time the most suitable flight was with Ryanair,'' he said.
However, it is likely airBaltic was not chosen because it was too expensive.
Meanwhile, airBaltic spokesman Janis Vanags emphasized that the company's prices are ''competitive enough'', 
but admitted that the price of tickets are more expensive when purchasing last minute.
The Latvian side only received an invitation to visit Berlin just several days before the scheduled meeting.

serviced. Therefore passengers are asked to arrive at the airport timely in order to settle all the necessary 
formalities.
The airline Yanair will start flying from Kiev to Riga International Airport on May 20, performing seven flights a week. 
The Spanish carrier Vueling will embark on its first flight from Barcelona to Riga on June 25, and the Greek Aegean 
Airlines will launch flights between Athens and Riga on June 26, providing flights once a week.
airBaltic on May 28 will open flights to Icelandic capital Reykjavik, and, in cooperation with the tour operator Tez 
Tour, from June 5 flights will be performed to the Italian seaside city of Rimini.
Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air from June 20 is planning to commence flights from Riga to Tel Aviv twice a week.
On the whole, in comparison with the summer season of 2015, the planned number of flights this summer is 
expected to stay at the last year’s level. The highest flight frequency from Riga will be observed on the route to 
Moscow (66 times a week), Stockholm (49 times a week), Helsinki (45 times a week) and London (39 times a 
week).

Holder of Lithuanian airports’ concession should attract more new passengers – daily
VILNIUS, Mar 16, BNS - Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of three Lithuania’s international 
airports, should focus its search for a concessionaire on potential partners that would bring in the largest numbers 
of new passengers, the Verslo Zinios business daily reports on Wednesday.
“Money, which will be received by the government, will disappear soon. It would be wiser to choose someone who 
will attract the largest numbers of passengers to the airports and to offer him concession partnership for free. This 
will guarantee the effectiveness of operations,” David O‘Brien, Chief Commercial Officer at Ireland’s budget carrier 
Ryanair, told the daily.
The competitive position of Vilnius airport was now stronger than in Riga in particular as the neighboring airport 
should soon introduce a new security charge, which would add to the costs of air carriers and would prompt them to 
look for cheaper landing sites, he added.

Ryanair set to open new base in Vilnius next fall
VILNIUS, Mar 15, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair next fall will open a new base with two aircraft at Vilnius 
Airport, will launch flights between Vilnius and Berlin, and will move two routes from Lithuania's second-biggest city 
of Kaunas to the capital, the company's chief commercial officer said on Tuesday.
"(Kaunas and Vilnius) are two different airports and two different cities. Due to the incentive system applied by 
Lithuania's airports, it is better for us to move some flights to Vilnius," David O'Brien said at a news conference in 
Vilnius.
According to the CCO,  Ryanair will station two new aircraft, an investment of 200 million US dollars, at Vilnius 
Airport, which will be its second Lithuanian base and number 82 worldwide, on Oct. 30.
He said that two routes -- to Birmingham and Malta -- would be moved from Kaunas to Vilnius. Berlin will be the 
only new destination to be launched from the Lithuanian capital this year.
Ryanair already has a base at Kaunas Airport.  The airline expects to carry more than 1.5 million passengers in 
Lithuania in 2016.

VILNIUS, Mar 15, BNS - Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania’s three international 
airports, is holding talks with an unnamed air carrier on non-low cost flights between Vilnius and Heathrow or 
Gatwick in London.
“The first priority from Vilnius is London. A product of a scheduled–traditional carrier, and not a low-cost carrier, to 
the airport of Heathrow or Gatwick. London is the hub of flights in Europe. Talks are very complicated,” Jurate 
Baltrusaityte, director of commerce at Lietuvos Oro Uostai, told BNS.
Such flights were mostly demanded by business customers, she said, adding that Lietuvos Oro Uostai had been 
negotiating with the carrier for approximately a year and a half.
Baltrusaityte could not disclose the name of the company.
Flights from Vilnius and Kaunas to London are currently only offered by budget carriers – Hungary’s Wizz Air and 
Ireland’s Ryanair. Late in March, the companies will also launch flights to London from Palanga.

airBaltic files appeal against ruling to pay EUR 16.1 mln in damages to Lithuania's flyLAL
RIGA, Feb 29, BNS/LETA – The Latvian national airline airBaltic has filed an appeal against the decision by the 
Vilnius Regional Court under which airBaltic is to pay EUR 16.121 million to Lithuania’s bankrupt air 
company flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines.
It is difficult to say when the Lithuanian Court of Appeal might hear the appellate claim by Airbaltic, LETA was told 
at the airline.
The Vilnius Regional Court made its ruling on January 27, 2016, ordering airBaltic to pay EUR 16.121 million in 
damages to flyLAL but discharging from liability the Riga airport.
The dispute between the parties over damages was heard behind closed doors. Latvia’s companies contested 
expert conclusions, which put the damages sustained by flyLAL due to discounts, which were provided by Riga 
Airport to airBaltic between 2004 and 2008 and were described by the Lithuanian air company as discriminatory, at 
EUR 43.4 million. flyLAL sought EUR 57.87 million in damages from the Latvian companies.
Commenting on the court ruling, airBaltic said it had been successfully restructured and was demonstrating 
consistent net profitability, therefore interest about the carrier was naturally growing. ”airBaltic will refrain from any 
comments while the multiple court proceedings are ongoing with flyLAL involved.   At the same time the airline will 
employ the available legal mechanisms to resolve and close the court proceedings,” the airline said, stating its 
intention to appeal the court decision.
The Lithuanian court's decision will not make airBaltic to revise its development plans in Lithuania but strong 
demand from both outbound and inbound travelers is a prerequisite for future growth in Lithuania, the Latvian airline 
said.

Back in 2006, Latvia’s competition regulator acknowledged that the discounts provided by the airport of Riga 
distorted the market and favored two companies –  Latvia’s airBaltic and Ireland’s Ryanair.
airBaltic, founded in 1995, is 99.8 percent owned by the Latvian state and serves direct flights to about 60 
destinations from its home base in Riga.

VILNIUS/RIGA, Jan 27, BNS - Latvia’s air carrier airBaltic has been ordered to pay 16.121 million euros to 
Lithuania’s bankrupt air company flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines by a Vilnius court.

flyLAL sought 57.87 million euros in damages from the Latvian companies.
airBaltic spokesman Janis Vanags told BNS that as the airline has been successfully restructured and is 
demonstrating consistent net profitability, the interest about the carrier is naturally growing. airBaltic refrain from any 
comments while the multiple court proceedings are ongoing with flyLAL involved.
At the same time, he underscored that the airline will use all available legal mechanisms to resolve and close the

Ziemelis: court confirms airBaltic’s price dumping policy as reason of flyLAL’s bankruptcy
VILNIUS, Jan 27, BNS - Dumping of airfares by Latvia’s air carrier airBaltic, which, as acknowledged by a 
Lithuanian court, is prohibited by the European Union’s (EU) competition law, has led to the bankruptcy of flyLAL-
Lithuanian Airlines, Gediminas Ziemelis, a former major shareholder of the Lithuanian air company, has said.
“Judicial proceedings have revealed the real reasons of bankruptcy of flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines. Even though the 
costs of flyLAL were reduced to the level of Ryanair or Wizz Air in four years after privatization, airBaltic used the 
discounts offered by the airport of Riga and dumped airfares hence the revenue of the Lithuanian company was not 
big enough and it could not generate a profit,” Ziemelis told BNS via a spokesperson.
According to Ziemelis, who is presently an indirect owner and chairman of Warsaw-listed Avia Solutions Group, 
airBaltic offered flights to 11 destinations at a time difference of meager 10 to 15 minutes from flyLAL’s flights to the 
same destinations.
“FlyLAL used shareholders’ money to cover the losses suffered due to unfair competition on the part of the Latvian 
air carrier. Meanwhile, airBaltic offset its extra low airfares with the discounts provided by the airport of Riga,” 
Ziemelis said.
After flyLAL’s exit from the market, airBaltic stopped direct flights from Vilnius and diverted passengers to Riga, he 
pointed out.
“As far as we know, after 10 years, airBaltic asked the local authority of Vilnius to grant more than 1 million euros in 
exchange for the reopening of some of the suspended routes from Vilnius,” Ziemelis said.
Ziemelis: court confirms airBaltic’s price dumping policy as reason of flyLAL ’s bankruptcy
The Regional Court of Vilnius on Wednesday ordered airBaltic to pay 16.121 million euros in damages to 
Lithuania’s bankrupt air company flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines. The airport of Riga, which applied discounts to 
airBaltic, has been discharged from liability, however.

Treasury loan to Latvian natl airline airBaltic to be capitalized in Jan 2016 - ministry
RIGA, Dec 02, BNS - It planned that the Treasury loan to the Latvian national airline airBaltic will be capitalized in 
January 2016, the Transport Ministry’s State Secretary, Kaspars Ozolins, said after the meeting of the 
parliamentary committee on budget and finances (taxes) which on Wednesday gave its consent to the 
capitalization.
He said that positive equity would enable airBaltic to turn to financial institutions for loans at competitive rates. For 
example, Lufthansa or Ryanair can get a loan with a 2-3 percent interest rate but at present the rate for airBaltic 
would be 13 percent or higher.
For now airBaltic would not need any additional state guarantees, the Transport Ministry official said.
Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis, who is the acting transport minister, pointed out to the press that an agreement 
had been reached about including in the shareholder agreement with the financial investor a provision banning the 
airline from buying, renting or using military equipment of any kind, thus preventing the possibility that airBaltic 
would buy the Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet aircraft.
As regards the possibility that airBaltic might buy its new Bombardier airplanes from Canada through Russia’s 
Ilyshin Finance, considering the links between the potential financial investor in airBaltic and the Russian company, 
Kozlovskis said that the investor had undertaken the responsibility for compliance with the international sanctions 
both as a corporate entity and as an individual.
The Latvian parliamentary committee on budget and finances (taxes) on Wednesday approved the plan for a 
Treasury loan to the national airline airBaltic and its subsequent capitalization. The transaction was approved on the 
Treasury loan to Latvian natl airline airBaltic to be capitalized in Jan 2016 - ministry
condition that the airline must not buy, rent or use military equipment of any kind and that the deal would not have 
any negative effect on the balance of the national budget.
The Latvian parliament will decide on whether to approve the capitalization of the Treasury loan to airBaltic at the 
plenary meeting on December 3.
The Latvian government at an extraordinary meeting on November 19 decided to authorize the Transport Ministry 
to sign the shareholder agreement with the financial investor for the national airline airBaltic, provided that the 
parliament approved a Treasury loan to the airline and its subsequent capitalization. 
On November 3 the Latvian government approved the investor for airBaltic, German businessman Ralf-Dieter 
Montag-Girmes, who is ready to invest 52 million euros in the company, while the Latvian government would be 
expected to contribute 80 million euros, planned in the form of a loan to the national airline from the Treasury which 
would be capitalized afterwards. A company founded by the investor in Latvia will acquire a 20 percent stake 
in airBaltic and that the government will have the right to buy out these shares when the strategic investor in 
attracted.
airBaltic, established in 1995, serves about 60 direct destinations from Riga. The Latvian state owns 99.8 percent 
of airBaltic shares.

Criminal probe against ex-head of Latvia's airBaltic carrier closed - TV
RIGA, Oct 26, BNS - A criminal probe that had been launched against Bertolt Flick, the former head of Latvia's 
airBaltic national carrier, has been closed, a TV report suggests.
"All criminal cases against me have been closed," LNT TOP-10 News, a weekly news program of Latvia's 
LNT commercial TV channel, quoted Flick as saying. The former airBaltic head also indicated that both the Latvian 
Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau and the prosecutor's office had found that he had not violated any 
Latvian laws.
"I am not banned from entering Latvia. I have no plans to return to Latvia at the moment, but I will surely visit Latvia 
sometime. I have lived there a long time, and I think that everyone knows that I am very fond of Latvia and Riga. I 
have no specific plans, and I am not going to take a Ryanair flight from Berlin," Flick told LNT.
At the end of 2013, the Latvian Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB) asked the Prosecutor 
General’s Office to bring criminal charges against a former airBaltic executive. KNAB representatives said that 
evidence obtained during the investigation allowed investigators to conclude that the airBaltic executive allegedly 
cancelled several airBaltic flights, scheduled for September 12 and 13, 2011, with the aim to influence the Cabinet 
of Ministers and state officials' decision to increase the company's share capital.
KNAB claimed that in abusing his office powers the airBaltic executive did not act in the interests of the airline but 
harmed them by cancelling the flights without any justified reason. These actions not only undermined the 
company's national and international reputation, but also caused significant financial losses. The anti-corruption 
watchdog did not disclose the name of the airBaltic executive.
airBaltic, which was then headed by Bertolt  Flick, cancelled several flights on September 12 and 13, 2011. The 
carrier was then facing liquidity issues and was holding talks with shareholders, including the Latvian government, 
on raising the company's share capital.
Criminal probe against ex-head of Latvia 's airBaltic carrier closed - TV
airBaltic, founded in 1995, is now 99.8 percent owned by the Latvian state and serves over 60 destinations from its 
home base in Riga.

(adds paras. 6-7)
RIGA, Oct 23, BNS - Flights to 69 destinations will be available from the Riga international airport in the Latvian 
capital during the winter season, which will begin on October 25, the airport’s spokeswoman, Sarmite Rinmane, told 
BNS.
She said that 21 airlines would be operating flights out of the Riga airport in the winter season, namely, the Latvian 
national air carrier Airbaltic as well as Aeroflot, Air Cairo, Belavia, Brussels Airlines, Corendon Airlines, Finnair, 
LOT, Lufthansa, Norwegian, Onur Air, Ryanair, Swiss International Air Lines, SAS, Transaero, Turkish Airlines, 
Turkmenistan Airlines, Utair, Ukraine International Airlines, Uzbekistan Airways and Wizz Air.
This winter season Aeroflot will increase the number of its flights from Riga to Moscow (Sheremetyevo) to 28 flights

carrier will be able to ensure the scheduled flights.

Ryanair, Wizz Air face higher charges in Vilnius airport
VILNIUS, Oct 09, BNS - Lithuania's deputy transport minister says that Vilnius Airport will apply the same charges 
to all airlines starting next year, which means that airport charges for the budget airlines Ryanair of Ireland and 
Wizz Air of Hungary are set to rise.
"The same charges and other conditions will apply to all air carriers in Vilnius Airport starting next year," Deputy 
Transport Minister Arijandas Sliupas said on LRT Radio on Friday.
Ryanair and Wizz Air now enjoy reduced airport charges in Vilnius.
"Both Ryanair and Wizz Air now have exceptional conditions in Vilnius as to airport charges. Such an agreement 
was signed four years ago in order to attract low-cost airlines to Vilnius Airport, but this period expires next year and 
we want to eliminate the discriminatory and exceptional conditions granted to these companies in Vilnius Airport," 
the official said.
Ryanair "has very good conditions" in Kaunas Airport, he added.
David O'Brien, chief commercial officer at Ryanair, which is set to launch three new routes from Vilnius and Kaunas 
next year, told the radio station that the company planned to continue expanding in Lithuania, but added that 
changes in Lithuania's airport charge policies might prevent this.

SAS says undecided on flights to Lithuania during Vilnius airport closure in summer 2017
VILNIUS, Oct 01, BNS - Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) says that it has yet to decide if it will operate flights to 
Lithuania during a temporary closure of Vilnius Airport for runway upgrades in the summer of 2017.
"We are still undecided on this matter and will decide within a year," SAS spokesman Henrik Edstrom told BNS.
Ruta Juciene, SAS' manager for the Baltic countries and Russia, told BNS that SAS' routes for the summer of 2017 
would only be known in the autumn of 2016.
Vilnius Airport CEO Arturas Stankevicius said earlier this week that Vilnius Airport would close for runway upgrades 
between Jul. 14 and Aug. 18, 2017 and that 13 out of the 15 airlines operating flights to the Lithuanian capital would 
move their flights to Kaunas or Palanga during that period.
The CEO said that the remaining two carriers, which he did not name, were still undecided.
According to media reports, the other undecided carrier is Turkish Airlines. The company's officials told BNS that 
they could not comment on their plans at the moment, but promised to do so in a week's time.
Other airlines operating flights to Vilnius include Wizz Air, airBaltic, Austrian Airlines, Small Planet Airlines, 
Lufthansa, UTair Aviation, Norwegian Air Shuttle, LOT, Ryanair, Finnair, Estonian Air, Ukraine International Airlines 
and Aeroflot.

Most flights to be moved to Kaunas during runway reconstruction at Vilnius airport in 2017
(expands)
VILNIUS, Sept 29, BNS - The airport of Vilnius will be closed down for 35 days for runway reconstruction in the 
summer of 2017 and most of the flights during that period will be moved to the airport of Kaunas, Lithuania’s second 
largest city.
“Thirteen airlines will choose another country’s airport. It will mainly be the airport of Kaunas. The remaining two air 
carriers have not yet decided. This is planning and we have to take this into account,” Arturas Stankevicius, CEO of 
Vilnius airport, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The airport of Kaunas planned to equip two additional terminals and to expand parking lots, he said, adding that the 
flow of traffic between Kaunas and Vilnius would be increased as well.
The nearly 60-year old runway of the airport of Vilnius will be upgraded between Jul. 14 and Aug. 18, 2017, in a 
project worth 27 million euros.
Preparatory works, first of all the laying of electric cables and replacement of runway lighting, will be launched next 
year. In 2017, the airport will strengthen the runway and upgrade its luggage system.
According to Stankevicius, passenger traffic should not decrease due to reconstruction as passengers would be 
able to go to Vilnius both from Kaunas and Klaipeda.
As estimated, the airport of Vilnius would have handled approximately 4,350 flights and more than 400,000 
passengers during the period of reconstruction, if not shut down. Some 77 percent of those flights and 90 percent of 
passengers are expected to be moved to other cities.

Wizz Air, airBaltic, Austrian Airlines, Small Planet Airlines, Lufthansa, UTair Aviation, Norvegian Air Shuttle, Turkish 
Airlines, LOT, Scandinavian Airlines, Ryanair, Finnair, Estonian Air, Ukraine International Airlines and Aeroflot now 
offer flights from Vilnius to 42 European cities.

Latvia's airBaltic carrier might have to adapt its flights after launch of Rail Baltica II
RIGA, Sep 25, BNS - Latvia's national carrier airBaltic might have to adapt its flights after trains start running on 
Rail Baltica II, airBaltic CEO Martin Gauss said in an interview with BNS.
"It is not a competitor as it is not there yet. In 2025 [when Rail Baltica II project should be completed] we will have to 
think what we do because the high speed train is a much better vehicle than a plane. In the next ten years there 
might be huge developments coming.  There is a good co-existence between train and plane in certain sectors. The 
Tallinn, Vilnius routes are still good ones with plane running besides trains. I believe that Rail Baltica is the best 
thing to come in the next ten years," Gauss said.
He also said that airBaltic is in a perfect position to increase travel and connectivity among the Baltic capitals. 
"airBaltic's market share is 31 percent in the Baltics and we see that the market share will go to 36 percent. But the 
frequency of flights is more interesting. As of today we have 41,000 frequencies, and we will go to 55,000 
frequencies in the Baltics in 2021. That is by far the strongest airline in the Baltics. If you look at Ryanair, for 
example, we see that they will increase the flights to the Baltics, but what they are doing is just a part of what we 
are doing," he said.
Gauss also said that today airBaltic has a 12-13 percent market share in Vilnius and 6 percent in Tallinn. "It will be 
much more in the next years. Of course, if we roll out all 11 frequencies from these destinations in those countries, 
we will be much stronger. We will ensure connectivity from Tallinn and Vilnius [to European cities]. We will not be 
focusing on the leisure traffic as it will be done by others. If this is an opportunity, we might add it, as we do it in 
Riga, but I think it is already very well served by others," Gauss said.
airBaltic, founded in 1995, is 99.8 percent-owned by the Latvian state and serves over 60 destinations from its 
home base in Riga.

Settlement of legal disputes has positive effect on results of Latvia's airBaltic - CEO
RIGA, Sep 25, BNS - The settling of each legal dispute in which Latvia's airBaltic national carrier has been involved 
has had a positive effect on the company's balance sheet, airBaltic CEO Martin Gauss told BNS.
The head of the company said the lawsuits had not affected the airline's operations. "We have a positive effect on 
our balance sheet from whatever legal dispute we solve because we have had to make a reserve in the balance 
sheet for each of them. Most of these disputes have been settled already, and those that will be settled this year will 
have a positive effect on this year's result. This is why I can say that we are going to have a good net result this 
year because we can release some of the reserves we have built for these cases. So it should have a positive 
effect on our operations," Gauss said.
Commenting on a legal dispute between airBaltic and Riga International Airport, Gauss said that the companies had 
submitted settlement proposals to the Latvian Transport Ministry. "The airport, as an independent entity, has 
submitted its documentation, we have submitted ours. Both of us are willing to close the case and settle the case 
outside the court and now the ministry has to decide," Gauss said.
The airBaltic CEO, however, was unable to tell when the dispute with the airport might be resolved. "I have not 
gone into detail, but what I know from our lawyers is that on both sides all issues have been addressed, including 
legal issues. Also, potential state aid issued had to be taken into account. To my knowledge, if there is a settlement 
agreement it will be in line with all regulations because otherwise it's not worth doing. So I hope that this has been 
taken into account by both sides, but it not for us to take these decisions. Different law firms have been working on 
it so I believe that we will find a solution," Gauss said, adding that both airBaltic and Riga airport are interested in 
closing this dispute.
airBaltic is involved in a number of legal disputes over the airline's takeover by the government.

The airline's dispute with the airport is about the fees charged for the airport's services. airBaltic accuses the airport 
of unfair treatment because the discounts offered to Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair had been bigger than those 
offered to the Latvian airline.
airBaltic, founded in 1995, is 99.8 percent-owned by the Latvian state and serves over 60 destinations from its 
home base in Riga.

Lithuanian Airports works on new pricing system - daily
VILNIUS, Jun 17, BNS - Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports) this month is starting discussions with air carriers 
on a new pricing system that the operator of the country's three major international airports says will be transparent, 
clear and non-discriminatory, the business daily Verslo Zinios reported on Wednesday.
However, the new system is likely to provoke a stormy reaction from some airlines, the paper wrote.
"The main difference is that under the existing pricing system, Ryanair and Wizz Air have special agreements at 
Vilnius Airport. New pricing principles will not provide for any such special agreements," it quoted Lietuvos Oro 
Uostai CEO Gediminas Almantas as saying.
The system, which is still being worked on, will apply equally to all carriers and will be understandable and 
transparent. It will include fees and charges based on the airports' costs, as well as a certain system of discounts 
for carriers, he said.

Kaunas airport going ahead with expansion
VILNIUS, Jun 09, BNS - The airport of Kaunas, the second largest Lithuania’s international airport, is developing 
infrastructure for AeroHub (KUN), a future cluster of aviation business companies.
“It’s not a project created by all cluster members. It’s the infrastructure being developed by the airport for the 
cluster’s operations…Its potential members include all companies providing aircraft maintenance services in the 
airport,” Gediminas Almantas, CEO of Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania’s three 
major international airports, told BNS.
He could not specify the amount of investment in the first stage of infrastructure development for now. Earlier he 
said that the initial stage of construction would require approximately 7.24 million euros in investment and later – 
additional 14.5 million euros.
The airport was now building a taxiway and an apron, Almantas said, adding that subsequent expansion would 
depend on companies’ needs.
According to the press release issued by Lietuvos Oro Uostai, the cluster will raise more than 20 million euros in 
investment and will create several hundred jobs.
Ryanair, FL Technics and Helisota currently operate aircraft maintenance centers at the airport of Kaunas.

Hungary's Wizz Air aims to fly over 550,000 passengers from Riga in 2015
RIGA, May 20, BNS - Hungarian low-costs carrier Wizz Air aims to fly more than 550,000 air passengers from Riga 
International Airport this year, the company's president Jozsef Varadi told BNS.
Wizz Air launched operations in Riga in 2010 and opened its hub there in June 2014, initially stationing one Airbus 
320 at Riga airport and flying to eight destinations in six countries. By now, Wizz Air has added one more plane to 
its Riga hub and is operating 11 routes from the Latvian capital.
Wizz Air has also opened a hub in the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius and operates 21 routes with four aircraft from 
Vilnus. For the time being, the company has no plans to develop a hub also in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Varadi 
said. Meanwhile, the company continues to explore the Baltic market and does not rule out further expansion in the 
region.
Asked how the company's business plans in Riga have been affected by the decision of Irish no-frills carrier 
Ryanair not to leave Riga, Varadi said that it had had no impact at all because although Wizz Air watches its rivals 
closely it takes its decisions independently. The Wizz Air president described the prices and contract terms of Riga 
airport, which had been the subject of the airport's disputes with Ryanair, as "acceptable".
Wizz Air marked its 11th anniversary this Tuesday, May 19.
Wizz Air is the largest low-costs airline in Central and Eastern Europe in terms of passenger numbers. It launched 
operations in Riga in March 2010. The company's shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange. Wizz Air 
reported 89 million euros profit for 2014 after suffering a nine million loss as recently as in 2011.

Scottish bus tycoon planning entry into Estonian market
TALLINN, May 14, BNS – The Scottish businessman Brian Souter, who runs low-cost bus service companies on 
the markets of Poland and Finland, has made the first steps toward entering the Estonian market with his company 
Bus Transport Holding, Aripaev said.
Asked for comment, John Berthinussen, head of investments at Souter Investments, said they were examining new 
markets. He refused comment specifically on the Baltic markets, saying that the company continues to be focused 
on growth and expansion.
Using effectively the Ryanair concept, Souter entered the Finnish market a few years ago and wreaked total havoc 
there, Aripaev said. The fares of Souter's Onnibus cut-price operator in Finland make up about a quarter of the 
fares of other operators and also of trains, Stuart Allt, founder of Expat Finland, has said.
Neeme Tammis, owner of the Estonian bus operator Hansabuss, said he has heard from his Finnish acquaintances 
what happened upon Souter's arrival there. He said Onnibus was called low-cost carrier and was aspiring to 
become the biggest bus company in Finland. It's no problem for Souter's companies to buy out 20–25 buses 
simultaneously, he said.
Hugo Osula, owner of Mootor Grupp, said that while his company Lux Express was positioning itself as a provider 
of quality bus rides, Souter's arrival will definitely put all the commercial carriers here under a lot of pressure. He 
said Lux Ekspress and Polski Bus are competitors on the Polish market now.
Amendments to the Estonian Transport Act passed by the previous parliament, which open the market to 
commercial carriers, will take effect on Oct. 1.

Riga airport’s success creates threat to natl carrier Airbaltic – Latvian minister
RIGA, May 14, BNS - Riga International Airport has been successful in attracting new airlines but this creates a 
threat to the Latvian national airline Airbaltic because of increased competition, Latvian Transport Minister Anrijs 
Matiss said during a discussion about development of the aviation sector on Thursday in Riga.
At present the Riga airport serves around 4.8 million passengers annually whereas Latvia’s total population is less 
than two million, he said. The changes in the number of air passengers need to be analyzed because, for example, 
the number of transit passengers reduced significantly in 2014 compared to 2013.
The transport minister praised the airport for bringing to Latvia new airlines and signing a new contract with the Irish 
low-cost carrier Ryanair but pointed out that this had also created a threat to Airbaltic through increased 
competition.
Speaking about Airbaltic, he said that the restructuring plan had been completed successfully and the airline was 
making profit again but a strategy for further development of the company was needed.
The expert estimates show that aviation and the related sectors represent a significant share of gross domestic 
product (GDP) therefore Latvia should come up with a long-term plan for the industry’s development and the 
required investments, the minister said.
The participants of the discussion about development of the aviation sector include representatives of the Latvian 
Transport Ministry, Riga International Airport, Airbaltic, Boston Consulting Group, bank analysts, representatives of 
NGOs and the industry experts.

Estonia: Ryanair planning 10 pct hike in passenger numbers in 2015
TALLINN, May 05, BNS – The Irish low cost carrier Ryanair is planning to carry 255,000 Estonian passengers in 
2015 or 10 percent more than last year.
Elina Hakkarainen, Ryanair's marketing and sales chief for the Nordic and Baltic region, told BNS that the company 
has been flying to Estonia for about four an a half years and on Wednesday the company will have carried 1.3 
million Estonian passengers.
According to Hakkarainen demand in Estonia has grown and more bookings have been made for the summer than 
last year.

Agreement between Riga airport, Ryanair officially signed
RIGA, Apr 20, BNS - The agreement between Riga International Airport and Irish low-cost airline Ryanair on ground 
handling services has been officially signed, BNS learned.
On April 2, Ryanair and Riga International Airport reached an agreement on the terms of the three-year contract for 
ground handling services. Riga International Airport had already signed a ground handling contract with Ryanair 
and had sent the document to Ryanair for signing. The airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Rinmane told BNS that the 
signed agreement has been received back from Ryanair. The contract will be in force for three years.
No details of the agreement are revealed, but Rinmane told BNS earlier that Ryanair will not have any other 
privilege in the airport than other low-cost airlines.
The contract signed between Ryanair and the Riga airport ten years ago expired on March 31.
Ryanair flies to 13 destinations from Riga: Glasgow, London, Manchester, Cologne, East Midlands, Leads, 
Duesseldorf, Dublin, Milan, Oslo, Bremen, Brussels and Frankfurt.

Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of the country's three biggest airports, told BNS, adding that it was

Latvia's Airbaltic natl airline considers flying to Dublin, Cork
RIGA, Mar 30, BNS - Latvia's national airline Airbaltic is considering a possibility to resume flights to Irish capital 
Dublin and might start flights to Irish city of Cork, said Airbaltic CEO Martins Gauss in an interview with Irish Travel 
Trade News portal.
"We are looking all the time at returning to Dublin Airport and Cork Airport is also interesting,” Gauss said.
"Dublin was a good route for us, with a large Latvian population in Ireland, but Ryanair was a competitor on the 
point-to-point service, so it was not as profitable as other routes. However, Ireland is an important market and in the 
medium to long term it should be connected well,” he said.
“Riga – Dublin – the US is also the best option for transatlantic traffic and talking with Aer Lingus about a codeshare 
would make sense," the Airbaltic director said
"Cork Airport would also be interesting – but we would probably introduce other, more profitable, routes first," he 
said
“From 2016 our growth will no longer be restricted by the EU, legal issues from the past are being resolved, the 
airline is now in profit, and we have one of the lowest cost bases in Europe," Gauss informed.
“Our restructuring started in 2011 and we are now in a position to attract the right private investor. We could also 
look at flying to Dublin from Talin or Vilnius, but these would be serving smaller communities in Ireland and we 
would also have to look at competitors on the routes," said Gauss.
Airbaltic stopped its flights to Dublin in 2011.

Airbaltic, founded in 1995, is controlled by the Latvian state and serves over 60 destinations from its home base in

RIGA, Mar 27, BNS - Scandinavian carrier SAS is resuming flights from Riga International Airport as of March 29, 
and Ukraine International Airlines and Swiss International Airlines are also launching operations in Riga this

She said that SAS will start flying from Stockholm to Riga on March 29, operating 18 flights a week on the route. 
Ukraine International Airlines will launch operations on the Kiev-Riga route, providing seven flights a week, and 
Swiss International Airlines will start flying from Zurich to Riga, providing three flights a week on that route.
Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier will start flying to five new destinations from Riga this summer: Aalborg in Demark, 
Dubrovnik in Croatia, Rhodes and Thessaloniki in Greece, as well as Pisa in Italy, the spokeswoman said.
The Riga airport spokeswoman also indicated that Hungarian low-costs airline Wizz Air will expand its hub in Riga 
this April by adding to it a second aircraft. The Hungarian carrier will also open three new destinations, to 
Stavanger, Lubeck and Liverpool, and increase the number of flights on the existing routes.
This summer season air passengers will be able to fly to 87 destinations from Riga, operated by 21 carriers:

Riga airport probes alleged thefts on Ryanair flight
RIGA, Mar 24, BNS - An inquiry has been started at Riga International Airport into alleged thefts from passengers' 
luggage on a Riga-Dublin flight provided on February 24 by Ireland's low-costs carrier Ryanair, the airport's 
representative Peteris Tars told BNS.
He said that the airport was alerted to the incident on the Ryanair flight from Riga to Dublin. "A probe has been 
started into this particular case to establish all circumstances of this incident," said Tars.
The airport's representative voiced regret for all instances where passengers have suffered discomfort and 
inconveniences, noting at the same time that the passenger who reported the alleged thefts to Nothing Personal, an 
analytical news program of Latvia's TV3 commercial channel, never filed a formal complaint with the airport.
Tars also indicated that minding passengers' luggage was the airline's duty under the contract between Ryanair and 
Riga airport.
Nothing Personal reported earlier that Riga airport staff allegedly rummaged in passengers' bags on the Ryanair 
flight, looking for wallets.
Edgars Kviotkovskis, an Ireland-based Latvian, told TV3 that he had suspicions that the airport's employees who 
loaded passengers' luggage on the Ryanair plane probably searched passengers’ bags looking for wallets. 
Kviotkovskis said that after 700 euros disappeared from his bag on an earlier flight, he put a hidden camera into his 
luggage on February 24, and the recording made that day suggested the airport's staff had been rummaging in the 
luggage.
Riga International Airport is the biggest aviation hub in the Baltic states.

There are no obstacles to Ryanair staying in Riga - airport CEO
RIGA, Mar 24, BNS - There are no obstacles to Irish low-costs carrier Ryanair staying in Riga International Airport, 
the airport's CEO Andris Liepins told BNS.
He said that Ryanair had already announced its summer flight schedule and that it also included flights to and from 
Riga. "There are still some details concerning ground handling services, they are being dealt with, but there are no 
obstacles preventing Ryanair from providing its services in Riga also in the future," said Liepins.
Latvian Transport Minister Andrijs Matiss said on public radio earlier that Riga International Airport's "super-
favorable" contract with Ryanair expires on March 28, but that there is no need to conclude a new agreement 
because after the contract expires, the Irish carrier will be paying the airport the same charges as other airlines.

Kaunas wants flights to Tampere to resume
VILNIUS, Mar 23, BNS - Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas wants a direct air service to the Finnish city of 
Tampere to be reopened and is ready to share the financial risk involved in maintaining the route.
Andrius Kupcinskas, the outgoing mayor of Kaunas, has made the proposal to Estonia's Avies Air Company, with a 
one-year agreement planned to be signed, Kaunas' local government said in a press release on Monday.
"Flights between Kaunas and Tampere in 2010-2013 were a great success. In 2012, for example, more than 20,000 
passengers traveled the Kaunas-Tampere route," Kupcinskas said in the press release.
It is expected that flights to Finland's third-largest city could be resumed as soon as this summer and be operated 
four times a week, ensuring at least 500 arriving passengers per month.
Ireland's Ryanair operated a service between Kaunas and Tampere several years ago.

Irish Ryanair most probably to remain in Riga - Latvian transport minister
RIGA, Mar 05, BNS - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, most probably, will keep working in Riga International Airport 
also after the current agreement expires in late March, said Latvian Transport Minister Anrijs Matiss in an interview 
with commercial LNT television on Thursday.
He underscored that none of the airlines working in Riga will not have any exclusive rights. "The agreement [with 
Ryanair] expires at the end of March and the tariffs set by the Riga airport will come into force. If the airline is selling 
tickets to flights, passengers are sure there will be flights. Thus, Ryanair will keep operating [in Riga] on those terms 
that are in force for all airlines working in Riga," said the minister.
Matiss reminded that Ryanair's exclusive agreement providing for discounts at Riga airport was signed for a period 
of ten years and expires in March this year.
The minister underscored that all airlines should be ensured equal terms.
Ryanair’s contract with Riga International Airport expires on March 31, 2015, but both parties have yet to reach an 
agreement on their future cooperation. 
Fully-owned by the Latvian state, Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

other countries if Lithuania were to increase charges in the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas.
“There are no indications showing that it’s necessary to hike the tax. However, there is an argument supporting the 
raising of tax – fuel prices have fallen and the profit of airline companies has increased. Then, perhaps, there could 
be not just one winner, but several?” Rimantas Sinkevicius told BNS.
Still, Ryanair could provide arguments against the raising of charges, for example, the expansion of maintenance 
center in the airport of Kaunas, he said.
The minister said that the issue would be negotiated.
“I don’t say that it will be the way I’m saying now. I say, we’ll meet and negotiate. It’s a complex issue and it requires 
a broad approach,” Sinkevicius said.
Ryanair would consider moving to other European airports if Lithuania were to increase airport charges, David 
O’Brien, Chief Commercial Officer at Ryanair, said at a news conference in Kaunas on Wednesday. However, he 
believes that the issue of charges would be settled.
Back in 2013, Ryanair threatened to reduce the number of flights from Kaunas as the Transport Ministry refused to 
lower charges and earmark more money for marketing.
Previously, the Irish budget carrier discontinued flight to certain airports in Germany and France due to increased 
charges.

Ryanair would consider exit from Lithuania if airport charges were to be increased – portal
VILNIUS, Feb 04, BNS - Ireland’s budget carrier Ryanair would consider moving its flights to other countries if 
Lithuania were to increase charges in the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas, the news portal vz.lt reports on 
Wednesday.
“Ryanair’s agreement on airport charges in Lithuania is set to expire in 2016. If Lithuania decides to increase them, 
the country will become less competitive. It will be a mistake… Then we would have to consider where to move our 
flights in Europe,” David O’Brien, Chief Commercial Officer at Ryanair, said at a news conference in Kaunas on 
Wednesday.
However, he believes that the company will manage to reach an agreement with the management of Lithuanian 
airports.
“I don’t see any problems as regards future agreements with the management of Lithuanian airports. I believe we 
will reach an agreement. If not, then we’ll make our decisions. The question is which airport will want us more,” 
O’Brien said.

Irish Ryanair plans to carry by 15 pct more passengers from Riga in 2015
(expands)
RIGA, Jan 23, BNS -  Irish low-cost airline Ryanair plans to carry about 850,000 passengers or by 15 percent more 
passengers from the Riga airport this year, Ryanair's sales and marketing head Neringa Ohrstrom told the press on 
Friday.
"We are here to greet our eight millionth passenger in Riga. Our summer flights are on sale. (...) We have 13 routes 
from Riga, including one new destination -- Cologne. (...) We plan to develop and serve 850,000 passengers this 
year," said Ohrstrom.
The company's representative did not comment on the negotiations between the airline and the Riga airport on the 
cooperation agreement that expires on March 31. "Unfortunately, I may not comment on corporate negotiations, but 
we are very happy in Riga. (...) We would not be here, if we were dissatisfied with our cooperation," she said.
Commenting on what happens with the summer season tickets in case Ryanair decides to discontinue cooperation 
with the Riga airport, she said that passengers should not worry about it. "We will take care," she said.
Riga airport board chairman Andris Liepins told BNS earlier that a proposal for further cooperation has been sent to 
Ryanair, but the airline has not responded to it yet.
Ryanair on Friday greeted its eight millionth passenger in Riga.
Ryanair is currently flying to 13 destinations from Riga – Glasgow, London, Manchester, Duesseldorf, Dublin, Milan, 
Oslo, Bremen, Frankfurt, Cologne, Brussels, East Midlands, Leeds.
Fully-owned by the Latvian state, Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

Latvian transport minister hopes Ryanair will not leave Riga airport
RIGA, Jan 23, BNS -  Latvian Transport Minister Anrijs Matiss hopes that Irish low-costs airline Ryanair will not 
leave Riga airport after its current contract expires on March 31, but said that there will be no nonstandard solutions 
for the Irish carrier.
“In the short-term, the challenge is to solve the Ryanair issue so that the company stayed and operated at Riga port 
on equal terms. It is important to us both in terms of connections and passenger convenience. But these terms must 
be fair. One company cannot be allowed to pay less than others,” the Latvian transport minister told BNS.
Matiss said that Ryanair cannot hope for better terms than other airlines operating at Riga airport. “I hope that we 
will succeed [in reaching an agreement], but there will be no nonstandard solution. The offer will be exactly the 
same we have already made to other airlines. Of course the charge also depends on the range of services, 
because it is also possible not to use all services provided by the airport. But for those services that it uses the 
company must pay in accordance with the approved pricelist,” Matiss said, adding that Ryanair cannot hope for 
nonstandard solutions like the ones that were in place at the airport a decade ago.
Ryanair’s contract with Riga International Airport expires on March 31, 2015, but both parties have yet to reach an 
agreement on their future cooperation.

Ryanair not likely to leave Riga, agreement to be reached - airport's CEO
RIGA, Jan 13, BNS - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is not likely to leave Riga and the agreement most probably will 
be reached, said Riga airport new board chairman Andris Liepins in an interview with commercial LNT television on 
Tuesday.
He said that the agreement between the airport and Ryanair expires in March and the airline has been sent a new 
proposal, including a service price similar to what other companies have. "I hope we will reach an agreement in the 
coming weeks," said Liepins.
The airport's head said that both Ryanair and the airport are interested in the carrier keeping its hub in Riga. "I think 
we will find a solution to keep Ryanair in Riga. (...) I cannot claim it by 100 percent, but, at the same time, Ryanair 
has announced its summer season, has started selling tickets, it means that it is interested in working from Riga," 
said Liepins.
Ryanair and the Riga airport so far have failed to agree on cooperation after their present agreement expires on 
March 31, 2015.
Ryanair  is currently flying to nine destinations from Riga – Glasgow, London, Manchester, Duesseldorf, Dublin, 
Milan, Oslo, Bremen and Frankfurt.
Fully-owned by the Latvian state, Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

Rinmane also said that the number of transit passengers last year accounted for 29 percent of all passengers and 
the most popular destinations for these passengers were Tallinn, Vilnius, Helsinki, Moscow and Stockholm.
The airport's board chairman Andris Liepins underscored that the airport this year will continue work on attraction of 
new airlines. "We are the biggest transport hub in the Baltics -- 46 percent of the region's air passengers are served 
in Riga. Also this year we will continue on a wide range of destinations and attraction of new carriers," he said.
In 2014, Riga International  Airport  in the Latvian capital served 4.814 million passengers, up 0.4 percent from the 
previous year. In December 2014, the  airport  served 344,300 passengers, which was a growth by 4.9 percent from

Incident with Ryanair plane in Tallinn Airport to not result in investigation
TALLINN, Dec 27, BNS - The Estonian Civil Aviation Administration and the Safety Investigation Bureau have 
decided not to launch an inquiry in regard to an incident concerning a Ryanair aircraft that took place at Tallinn 
Airport on Monday because the incident was not that dangerous, the daily Postimees reports.
An incident took place at Tallinn Airport on Monday when a Ryanair airplane tried to land while a Flybe aircraft has 
just landed and had not vacated the runway. The Ryanair aircraft aborted the landing and no collision took place.
Departmental head at the Estonian Air Navigation Services Ullar Salumae told the TV3 television station on 
Tuesday that the Ryanair pilot should have flown another lap instead of landing. Salumae said that even if the plane 
would have landed, no tragic consequences would have followed.
Spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Administration Riina Muld told Postimees that the administration is aware of the 
incident but most likely no inquiry will take place since it was not such a dangerous incident.
Salumae said on Tuesday that the Air Navigation Services launched an internal inquiry to investigate the incident.

Latvian state slow to support social enterprises
During the sixth Baltic Social Entrepreneurship Forum business representatives, experts and public officials 
discussed the importance of social entrepreneurship and its effects on sustainable growth. Comparison with other 
countries in the Baltic region and the EU member states revealed that Latvia was lagging behind and Latvian 
politicians lacked interest in developing social entrepreneurship. There are no laws in Latvia defining social 
entrepreneurship and it seems to be the reason why the state would not recognize this form of business. The 
Welfare Ministry has promised to produce the definition and the law about social entrepreneurship in 2018 at the 
earliest.

Ryanair given as another reason for removing Riga airport board
While the Latvian Transport Ministry is busy looking for new board members for Riga International Airport, no 
explanation has been given about why the previous board had to be dismissed at this exact time. The board 
members resigned over differences regarding reorganization of the airport’s services, and there have also ben 
reproaches about huge legal expenses in litigations with former employees. The former board members are being 
criticized also for inept communication with the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair.

Next round in fight over micro enterprise tax
The Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry will submit to the parliament a proposal to keep the micro 
enterprise tax unchanged at 9 percent of turnover in 2015. This proposal is supported by the three opposition 
parties and the ruling nationalist conservative National Alliance, in particular its representative Romans Naudins, 
the chairman of the parliamentary committee for economic policies. Naudins has also suggested that in future the 
tax rates might be differentiated depending on the sector, saying that the tax rate for manufacturers was already 
high enough but could be increased for service providers.

Few cos affected by Russian embargo seek tax holidays
Regardless of the significant losses incurred by the Latvian companies due to the Russian embargo, only 31 
businesses have submitted to the Latvian State Revenue Service (VID) requests for tax holidays by early 
November. Just three of those companies represent the dairy sector that has been most seriously affected by the 
Russian embargo. The VID said that from August 14 to October 31 it had received 37 requests from 31 tax payers, 
who claimed they needed the tax relief due to the situation in the Russian market and the decline in exports to 
Russia. Food Union, the largest dairy company in Latvia, is one of few dairy companies that had applied for tax 
relief.

Ryanair wants special status in Riga but it's impossible – airport’s CEO
RIGA, Sep 12, BNS - The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is seeking a special status for itself at Riga airport in the 
Latvian capital, the airport’s CEO, Aldis Murnieks, said in an interview with BNS.
The current agreement between Ryanair and Riga airport will expire on March 31, 2015.
„The airport’s management would be glad to see Ryanair with its flights and interesting offers here also in future. 
But what Ryanair currently demands from the airport can’t be done,” Murnieks said.
The airport simply has to have equal terms for all carriers as required by the EU regulations but Ryanair is trying to 
get special terms for itself, the CEO of Riga airport said, adding that the terms offered to Ryanair were the same as 
for the Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air, for example.
Murnieks suggested that Ryanair had been „spoiled” by many small municipalities and their airports that were 
willing to provide special terms to bring airlines to their territory but Riga airport did not have much leeway as it had 
to comply with the EU regulations.
Special terms were good in the past as they served to bring low-cost airlines to Riga but Ryanair had been enjoying 
them too long. „The rules must be transparent and the same for all [carriers],” the airport’s CEO said, adding that if 
someone paid less for the airport’s services, others would have to pay more.
When asked which might be the location that Ryanair could choose, if it decided to cease operations out of Riga, 
Murnieks presumed that Lithuania was a likely option.
"It is hard to say. Should Ryanair withdraw from Riga airport, I would be glad if it moved to Tukums [a town in 
western Latvia some 70 km from Riga],” he said.
Ryanair wants special status in Riga but it's impossible – airport’s CEO
But a lot of things still have to be done in Tukums airport before it meets all standarts, Murnieks said. Ryanair has a 
whole list of requirements and regular flights might be a big challenge for a small airport therefore Tukums would 
not be the likely choice in the next few years and Ryanair is most likely to choose Lithuania, if it decided to move 
out of Riga, the airport’s CEO said.
Ryanair plans to serve up to 760,000 passengers at Riga airport this year. Ryanair is currently flying to nine 
destinations from Riga – Glasgow, London, Manchester, Duesseldorf, Dublin, Milan, Oslo, Bremen and Frankfurt.
Fully-owned by the Latvian state, Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

Wizz Air not to mind becoming 2nd largest airline in Riga – CCO
RIGA, Aug 18, BNS - The Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air would not mind becoming the second largest airline 
operating in the Riga airport in the Latvian capital, although it is not one of the company’s targets, György Abrán, 
Chief Commercial Officer of Wizz Air, said in an interview with BNS.
He said that Wizz Air currently was in the third place in the Riga airport after the Latvian national airline Airbaltic and 
the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. But taking a specific market share in Riga is not among the company’s targets, 
Abrán said.
Wizz Air’s market share in Riga will definitely increase with more flights and opening of new routes but the 
company’s goal is to build profitable operations and to ensure sufficient return on investment, the airline’s CCO 
said.
He said Wizz Air would continue growing also in the coming years but no longer at a pace of 50 percent as such 
growth rate was not sustainable. Steep growth is typical when Wizz Air enters a new market but afterwards the 
growth rate stabilizes, Abrán said.
Nevertheless, Wizz Air counts on a growth of some 20 percent in the Baltics which would still be a much faster 
growth compared to other airlines, he said, adding that this meant new routes and more flights for the Latvian 
market.
The CCO of Wizz Air said that the airline would not mind becoming the second largest airline in the Riga airport but 
it was not the company’s target to become the No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3 – instead it would strive to take the 
opportunities it saw.
The operator offering the best quality to price ratio will win in this market, and our growth will continue, if the Latvian 
people liked the quality we offer, he said.
Wizz Air not to mind becoming 2nd largest airline in Riga – CCO
On June 19 this year Wizz Air opened its base in the Riga airport. Wizz Air started operating in Riga in March 2010 
and currently offers 25 flights a week on eight routes from Riga.
Wizz Air is the largest low-cost airline in Central and Eastern Europe by passenger numbers. Last year it carried 
13.5 million passengers and has 17 bases in nine Central European countries.

Irish Ryanair has not yet reached agreement with Riga airport; might leave Riga
RIGA, Aug 07, BNS - Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and international airport Riga have not yet reached an 
agreement on cooperation next year, said the airport's board chairman Aldis Murnieks.
The current agreement between both companies expires on March 31, 2015.
According to information available to BNS, Ryanair is likely to leave Riga as talks on the new agreement between 
Ryanair and the airport had not been successful -- Ryanair does not agree with the terms offered by the airport. 
There is an ongoing court action against the airport's terms for Ryanair as Latvian national carrier Airbaltic believes 
these terms are unfair and distorting competition. Ryanair might make the announcement on leaving the Riga 
airport in the nearest time.
Murnieks said that he has no information about Ryanair's plans to leave the Riga airport. "Currently I do not have 
such information, therefore I do not wish to comment on rumors. (...) Talks between the airport and Ryanair are 
ongoing -- actively or less actively. The airport's proposal is clear and Ryanair now has to accept it or decline it," the 
airport's head said.
He also said that there is interest about Riga airport from other companies and the aviation market is lively. "For 
example, Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is opening new routes from Riga and expanding its hub with new 
planes. If Ryanair makes its decision [to leave the airport] we will have to accept it, but I do not wish to comment on 
it further," said Murnieks.
Wizz Air commercial director Gyorgy Abran, who on Wednesday announced on expansion of its hub in Riga, 
confirmed that he has heard rumors about Ryanair possibly leaving Riga. Wizz Air's expansion plans, however, are 
based on the company's own development plans and goals.
Irish Ryanair has not yet reached agreement with Riga airport; might leave Riga
Ryanair refused to comment on the situation in a conversation with BNS.
Ryanair plans to serve up to 760,000 passengers at Riga airport. Ryanair is flying to nine destinations from Riga.
Riga is the biggest airport in the Baltic states by passenger turnover.

VILNIUS, May 07, BNS - Lithuania's privately-owned ground handling company Litcargus intends to withdraw from 
Poland after a failure of its plans of active expansion in the neighboring country.
"Stronger expansion in Poland, which was planned for 2013, was not successful," the company said in its 2013 
report submitted to the Center of Registers.
In 2013, the company's audited revenues rose by 2.2 percent to 19.041 million litas (EUR 5.5 mln), from 18.638 
million litas in 2012. Its audited net profit plunged to 127,500 litas, from 994,400 litas in 2012.
Revenues from services provided to Ryanair accounted for 27 percent of the company's total revenue last year. 
Airbaltic accounted for 15 percent, Deutsche Lufthansa - for 15 percent as well, and SAS - for 7 percent.
Litcargus is fully owned by Luxembourg-registered Central European Airport Services.

Riga airport aims for EUR 78,700 profit in 2014
RIGA, Apr 23, BNS - Riga International Airport is planning to make a 78,700 euros profit this year, which is 
significantly less than the airport's preliminary 2013 profit, the Latvian Transport Ministry said in a report.
The ministry also informs that during 2014 Riga airport is expected to serve 4.878 million passengers, which would 
be a 1.4 percent rise from 2013, while the number of flights is expected to drop by 0.4 percent to 66,800 this year.
According to the ministry's information, two airlines -- Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier and Irish low-costs airline 
Ryanair -- are expected to fly 76 percent of the passengers served at Riga airport in 2014, down from 77 percent in 
2013, 81 percent in 2012 and 86 percent in 2011.
The ministry said that the airport is projecting its operating 2014 profit at 4.255 million euros, while its net profit is 
planned at 79,000 euros. "The airport must close 2014 in the black in order to ensure the implementation of the EU-
funded project the Development of Riga International Airport Infrastructure. Furthermore, Riga airport is not 
planning to make any payments in the government budget for the use of capital. If the airport has to make such 
payments, it will be unable to repay the loans taken for the project financed by the Cohesion Fund," the ministry 
said.
The goal for 2014 is to continue to develop the airport as a profitable transit airport, promoting competition in the 
aviation industry and setting the Development of Riga International Airport Infrastructure project as a priority.
This year, the airport's operating revenue is planned at 43.055 million euros. Aviation revenue is expected to drop 
by 2 percent, non-aviation revenue is likely to contract by 13 percent, and the airport's total revenue this year is 
projected to decrease by 7 percent in annual terms.
According to preliminary data, Riga International Airport generated a 3.6 million lats (EUR 5.196 mln) profit in 2013.
Riga airport aims for EUR 78,700 profit in 2014
Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. In 2012, the airport posted 30.16 million 
lats in turnover at a 29.8 percent rise from a year before, while its profit grew 3.4 times to 1.37 million lats.

Riga airport to contest experts' findings favorable to FlyLAL, hearings to be non-public
(expands)
VILNIUS, Nov 21, BNS - Riga Airport, which is accused of unfair competition, is set to contest experts' findings that 
are favorable to FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines and would allow awarding the bankrupt Lithuanian carrier around 150 
million litas (EUR 43.5 mln) in damages from the airport and Latvia's AirBaltic.
The Vilnius Regional Court on Thursday took note of requests from AirBaltic and Riga Airport regarding commercial 
confidentiality and decided to hold non-public hearings.
With the parties arguing over whether or not the hearings should be public, Rimantas Simaitis, a lawyer 
representing the airport, said that his client would contest court-appointed experts' findings.
"Riga Airport disagrees regarding the methods, data and sources. We will submit a new conclusion by experts, 
giving a completely different opinion," he told the court on Thursday.
Simaitis said that the methodology used by the experts was flawed and their findings were wrong.
It was AirBaltic that asked the court to hold closed hearings. AirBaltic's lawyer, Iraida Zogaite, said that the airline 
sought to protect its commercial secrets and that discussions about details of the case in the media were harmful to 
the company as well.
"Following the announcement about the initiation of the case, passenger numbers dropped and losses were 
incurred," she told the court.
Riga airport to contest experts' findings favorable to FlyLAL, hearings to be non-public
FlyLAL objects to closed hearings because it could lose a tool to steer the case in a direction favorable to it, Zogaite 
said.
The court-appointed experts established this fall that FlyLAL had incurred 149.86 million litas in losses due to 
actions by AirBaltic and Riga Airport. The bankrupt airline sticks to its opinion that the Latvia companies should pay 
it 199.83 million litas in damages.
FlyLAL in 2008 obtained a Lithuanian court order to freeze almost 200 million litas worth of assets of AirBaltic and 
Riga Airport, accusing the Latvian companies of unfair competition.
Latvia's competition authority ruled in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and favored 
two companies -- Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

Contracts with Ryanair, Wizz Air disadvantageous to Vilnius Airport - CEO
VILNIUS, Sep 23, BNS - Vilnius Airport CEO Gediminas Almantas says that contracts with Ireland's budget carrier 
Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air are disadvantageous to the airport and that the decision to allow Ryanair to fly from 
Vilnius was a mistake, the daily Lietuvos Rytas reported on Monday.
"Both Wizz Air and Ryanair have contracts at Vilnius Airport, which will be effective for another three years. These 
contracts cannot be changed or terminated, and they are very disadvantageous to the airport," Almantas said.
Ryanair is now speaking about flights from Lithuania in general, rather than from Vilnius and Kaunas separately, 
saying that they want the same rates at both airports, or otherwise they will end flights from Kaunas, the CEO said.
"That would mean bankruptcy to Kaunas. They (the Irish) know it and abuse it," he said.
Almantas said that lower rates in Kaunas did not motivate Wizz Air.
"We cannot force them to fly from Kaunas," he said.
Almantas will be at the helm of a new company into which all three Lithuanian international airports, of Vilnius, 
Kaunas and Palanga, will be merged.

years, but it is talking to Spain's Vueling and to Norwegian, the daily Lietuvos Rytas reported on Monday.
"We are constantly talking to other low-cost carriers. We can forget about Easy jet for several years. They are doing 
well in the Western market. We are talking to Spain's Vueling and Norwegian. Our region is interesting to them," it 
quoted Vilnius Airport CEO Gediminas Almantas as saying.
However, it is difficult to bring an airline into a market where Ireland's Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air have strong 
positions, the CEO said.
"The question is who wants to go somewhere where two carriers as strong as (Ryanair and Wizz Air) are already 
operating, and under such good conditions too. Nobody wants. So, any negotiations on our part are weak if we do 
not offer the same conditions. And we cannot offer such conditions," he said.

Ryanair to invest another EUR 1.6 mln in Kaunas
VILNIUS, Sep 13, BNS - Ireland's air carrier Ryanair is expanding its aircraft maintenance operations at Kaunas 
Airport, with plans to invest 5.6 million litas (EUR 1.6 mln) and service twice as many aircraft.
Ryanair plans to employ an additional 40 aviation mechanics, Invest Lithuania, the government's foreign investment 
promotion agency, said in a press release on Friday.
"Ryanair decided to continue its expansion in Kaunas and almost double the number of high-skilled employees," 
Kaunas Aircraft Maintenance Services Director Karolis Cepukas was quoted as saying in the press release.
Ryanair opened its Kaunas airport base in 2010 and set up its aircraft maintenance, repair and operations facility at 
the airport in 2012. The facility currently employs almost 50 people. Early this year, the Irish company invested 
more than 10 million litas in new aircraft maintenance and repair hangar in Kaunas.

Ryanair to offer flights to 8 destinations from Kaunas in winter
VILNIUS, Aug 02, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair plans to offer flights to eight destinations from Kaunas, 
Lithuania's second biggest international airport, during the winter season, i.e. from November to March.
"We appreciate Ryanair's plans for Kaunas and are happy that there will be a possibility to go south in winter as 
well," Arijandas Sliupas, Transport Deputy Minister and former CEO of Kaunas airport, told BNS.
The air carrier would operate more routes during the next winter season than in the previous season, he noted.
"We are moving towards good cooperation. We, as well as Ryanair, see room for expansion both in Kaunas and in 
Vilnius," Sliupas told BNS.
Ryanair reported that it would offer flights to Sardinia, Paphos, Bristol, Dublin, Frankfurt, Luton and Stansted 
airports in London as well as Oslo in winter.

Lithuanian court turns down Riga Airport's request to provide coverage for losses
VILNIUS, Jul 03, BNS - FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines, a Lithuanian air company in bankruptcy, is not obliged to 
provide coverage for the reimbursement of 233.6 million litas (EUR 67.7 mln) in potential losses to the Airport of 
Riga, the Lithuanian Court of Appeal has ruled.
The court on Jul. 2 turned down the airport's request to demand reimbursement of losses from the Lithuanian 
company, which initiated the seizure of 199.83 million litas worth of property of the airport and Latvia's air carrier 
Airbaltic.
The college of judges stated that the parties to the dispute were equal hence the airport could address the court at 
any time if it suffered inadequate consequences or excessive restrictions of operations due to the seizure of 
property.
The airport, assisted by experts from Ernst&Young Baltic, tried to convince the court that it might suffer between 
203.09 and 233.6 million litas in losses due to the seizure of property.
FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines several years ago filed a 200-million-litas claim against Airbaltic and the Riga Airport and 
obtained a Lithuanian court order to freeze almost 200 million litas worth of their assets.
FlyLAL back in 2008 took the two Latvian companies to court, claiming that Riga Airport had provided Airbaltic with 
discounts that were discriminatory against other airlines.
Latvia's Competition Council ruled in 2006 that discounts offered by the airport distorted the market and favored two 
companies -- Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

information on the companies or direct flights.
Cyprus wants to attracts tourist from northern Europe in winter as well.
"With the two and a half, three hours flight you can get from minus 20 to plus 20. We want to create this link so that 
we can extend the season from October to March," the minister said.

VILNIUS, May 16, BNS - Vilnius Airport is holding talks with Spain's budget carrier Vueling, Gediminas Almantas, 
new CEO of Lithuania's biggest international airport, has said.
"Speaking about new budget carriers, I don't see today that there could be any coming here... Whether there will be 
any in future, it may definitely happen so. However, in Europe, budget carriers are not too willing to barge in where 
two budget carriers are already present. That's the usual practice," he said at a news conference on Thursday.
Later he added that the airport was talking about flights with Vueling now. "Vueling is a very interesting air carrier. 
We are talking to them as well."
However, Almantas believes that no new budget carriers will start operations at Vilnius Airport in the near time. 
Ireland's Ryanair and Hungary's Wizzair are offering flights to and from Vilnius now.
New CEO of the airport also said that he would seek to improve links with certain European cities, including 
Brussels, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Munich.
Lawyer Almantas won a competition to fill the job of CEO of Vilnius Airport early in May.

Latvian Supreme Court Senate to turn to EU Court regarding arrest of Airbaltic property
RIGA, May 15, BNS - The Latvian Supreme Court Senate Wednesday decided to suspend litigation  in the 
complaint of Riga international airport and Airbaltic national carrier about arrest of their properties worth 40 million 
lats (EUR 57 mln), and turn to the Court of Justice of the European Union, the court's spokeswoman Baiba Kataja 
told BNS.
To decide whether to recognize and enforce a Lithuanian court's ruling freezing assets of Riga airport and Latvia's 
Airbaltic, the Senate first wishes to receive answers from the Court of Justice.
The litigation has been suspended until the Court of Justice ruling comes into force. The Senate's decision is final.
In May 2012, Riga Regional Court assessed the January 19 ruling of Riga City Vidzeme District Court, which 
satisfied flyLAL 's request to recognize and execute the Lithuanian Appeals Court's verdict in Latvia. The ruling of 
Riga City Vidzeme District Court upheld the verdict of the Lithuanian court to seize 40.77 million lats worth of 
Airbaltic and Riga airport's assets.
Lithuanian Appeals Court on Dec. 31, 2008, upheld the decision of Vilnius Regional Court satisfying a claim by 
FlyLal and arresting the property of Airbaltic and the Riga airport worth 40.77 million lats (EUR 58.01 mln). FlyLal 
said in its claim that it had suffered a loss of almost 40.8 million lats because the Riga airport had set for 
Airbaltic more favorable terms, which enabled the Latvian airline to set lower prices on its flights and to weaken its 
competitors.
In November 2004 Riga airport introduced a price policy under which the size of the airport's fees depended on the 
number of air passengers carried by each airline. In November 2006, the Latvian Competition Council ordered the 
airport to end this discount policy, on the grounds that it contained elements of abuse of dominant position.
Latvian Supreme Court Senate to turn to EU Court regarding arrest of Airbaltic property
In November 2009, Riga airport launched a new price policy, giving up the previous discount system, which had 
favored Ireland's Ryanair and Latvia's Airbaltic that served a large number of passengers in Riga.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from all three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn. Airbaltic was founded in 1995, 
and the Latvia state with 99.8 a percent stake is its largest shareholder.
Lithuanian national airline flyLAL went bankrupt in 2009.

Ryanair invites Lithuanian transpmin to meet to discuss proposals
VILNIUS, Apr 27, BNS - Ireland's budget airline Ryanair has invited Lithuanian Transport Minister Rimantas 
Sinkevicius to meet to discuss the carrier's proposals.
"I have today written to the minister inviting him to meet so that we can convey our proposals directly to him," 
Ryanair Deputy CEO Michael Cawley said in a press release on Friday evening. 
Cawley added that he regretted that Sinkevicius had used "emotional language" in his response to Ryanair's recent 
announcement that it would reduce services at Kaunas Airport starting November. 
Commenting on Ryanair's plans to cut services because it had not received more money for the marketing and 
advertising of its flights, the minister said on Thursday that the airline "has to understand it is not operating in the 
Zulu Kingdom".
Ryanair said earlier this week that it had offered to carry an additional 500,000 passengers annually, but the 
Transport Ministry had not responded to these proposals.
According to media reports, Kaunas Mayor Andrius Kupcinskas next week is planning to meet with Deputy 
Transport Minister Arijandas Sliupas, a former CEO of Kaunas Airport, to discuss Ryanair's services and issues 
raised by the carrier.
The Irish carrier, which entered the Lithuanian market in September 2005, operates flights from the airports of 
Vilnius and Kaunas.

Lithuanian TranspMin says Ryanair wants higher discounts than rival Wizz Air
(expands)
VILNIUS, Apr 23, BNS - Ryanair's statement that the Lithuanian Transport Ministry is not interested in the Irish 
airline's expansion at the airports of Kaunas and Vilnius came as a surprise to the ministry's officials.
Ricardas Slapsys, an advisor to the transport minister, told BNS that the ministry had been working actively with 
Ryanair officials.
"We were surprised at Ryanair's statement. The ministry cooperates quite actively and meetings with Ryanair are 
not infrequent. We are looking for the most favorable ways of how Ryanair could operate in Lithuania. This 
company is already getting much attention as one of the biggest carriers in Lithuania. We can't grant exceptional 
terms and special discounts to them because that would go against European law," he said.
Ryanair is asking for higher discounts than Hungary's Wizz Air, its main rival at Vilnius Airport, but the ministry 
cannot grant such requests, Slapsys said.
The official said that Ryanair's statement that it was planning to reduce the number of flights from Kaunas Airport by 
25 percent starting Nov. 1 could be linked to the end of the summer season.
The Irish airline said in a press release on Tuesday that it had offered to carry an additional 500,000 passengers 
through the airports of Kaunas and Vilnius annually, but the Transport Ministry had not responded to these 
proposals.
"Unfortunately, the Lithuanian government declined to engage in discussions, leaving Ryanair no choice but to 
reduce its operations in the Kaunas base by 25 percent," it said.

Ryanair has an aircraft maintenance and service hangar at Kaunas Airport and is currently building a second one.
Meanwhile, Wizz Air, which launched operations at Vilnius Airport two years ago, said on Tuesday that it had further 
expansion plans in Lithuania.

Airlines to offer 9 new destinations from Latvia's Riga Airport in summer season
RIGA, Mar 28, BNS - The airlines operating out of Riga International Airport in the Latvian capital will offer nine new 
destinations -- 6 scheduled and 3 charter flight destinations -- in the summer season, which will begin on March 31, 
the airport's spokeswoman, Elina Krastina, told BNS.
Overall, the flight frequency will increase by 24 percent compared with the winter season, and there will be more 
flights to such destinations as Helsinki, Stockholm, Tallinn, Moscow, New York, Istanbul, Minsk and others, she 
said.
"Eight popular destinations to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea are back 
on the route map of [the Latvian national airline] Airbaltic. In April Airbaltic will open flights to Larnaca and in May 
flights to Balaton Airport, Olby and Malta, and from June - to Rijeka. Since the beginning of 2013 Airbaltic has been 
providing flights to Prague. In addition, Airbaltic introduced additional flights on 11 routes from Riga to Paris, 
Barcelona, Nice, Stockholm, Rome, London and Bari. The flights to the capital cities of France and the United 
Kingdom will be available twice a day, while flights to Stockholm will be provided four times a day," Krastina said.

Kaunas Airport back in black in 2012
VILNIUS, Mar 25, BNS - Kaunas International Airport, the second largest airport in Lithuania, posted 73,700 litas 
(EUR 21,362) in net profit for 2012 reversing the year-earlier losses of 626,000 litas.
The revenues edged up by 0.8 percent, year-on-year, to 9.333 million litas, the airport said in its 2012 report.
The airport handled 830,000 passengers last year, down 5 percent from 2011. Mail volumes increased by 9 
percent, to 1,700 tons.
Passenger traffic declined since Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair cut the number of routes offered from Lithuania's 
second biggest city, the report said. Last December Ryanair operated four routes from Kaunas, down from 17 at the 
end of 2011.

Ugianskis steps down as CEO of Kaunas Airport
VILNIUS, Mar 04, BNS - Povilas Ugianskis is to step down as CEO of Kaunas Airport, Lithuania's second-biggest 
airport, on Mar. 15 after working just four months in this position.
Ricardas Slapsys, an adviser to transport minister, told BNS that Ugianskis had filed for voluntary leave.
"I can confirm that the CEO of Kaunas Airport has submitted a resignation notice asking to be discharged from Mar. 
15. It's his personal decision," Slapsys told BNS.
Povilas Ugianskis is the son of Gintaras Ugianskis, former chairman of Ukio Bankas. Slapsys told BNS that the 
airport of Kaunas had not held any deposits in the collapsed commercial bank.

Airbaltic fails to recover EUR 27.5 mln in damages from FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines
VILNIUS, Mar 01, BNS - FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines is not obliged to pay a 95 million litas (EUR 27.5 mln) deposit 
as a security against possible damages that may be awarded to Airbaltic due to the seizure of nearly 200 million 
litas (EUR 58 mln) worth of property of Latvia's air carrier and the airport of Riga, which was imposed back in 2008 
at the request of the Lithuanian airline in bankruptcy that accused the airport of unfair competition.
Airbaltic claims that it has suffered at least 25.8 million euros in losses.
However, the Lithuanian Court of Appeal on Thursday turned down a complaint from Airbaltic and upheld the 
decision, which was taken by the Vilnius Regional Court last December and was unfavorable for the Latvian air 
carrier.
"The respondent has not provided any evidence that it has suffered any actual losses in the past four years, i.e. 
since the introduction of interim safeguard measures, or is suffering such losses now. Also, the data available in this 
case does not provide a possibility even to project the losses that may be suffered by the respondent in future or 
their scale," the court's decision reads.
Air Baltic Corporation told the court that, with its assets seized, it suffered losses due to negative response from the 
public, lost revenues and termination of aircraft lease contract, and the amount of those losses might reach around 
25.8 million euros.
Airbaltic pointed out that FlyLAL's debts exceeded 873 million litas hence it was highly doubtful that the collapsed 
airline could pay the damages if it was told to do so by court.
A Lithuanian court has imposed a seizure on 199.83 million litas worth property of Airbaltic and the airport of Riga.
Airbaltic fails to recover EUR 27.5 mln in damages from FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines
FlyLAL went to court back in 2008 accusing the airport of Riga of providing Airbaltic with discounts that were 
discriminatory against the Lithuanian airline.
Latvia 's Competition Council ruled in 2006 that the discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and 
favored two companies - Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

Ryanair plans to build 2nd hangar at Kaunas airport
(expands)
VILNIUS, Feb 12, BNS - Ireland 's budget carrier Ryanair plans to build the second aircraft maintenance hangar 
and an office at Kaunas Airport. The project will be developed by the company's aircraft maintenance subsidiary, 
Kaunas Aircraft Maintenance Services.
A total of 3 million litas (EUR 0.87 mln) in the European Union (EU) support had been earmarked for the project, the 
Lithuanian Business Support Agency reported on Tuesday. The agency, which signed a respective contract with the 
company last week, said on its website that the project would be worth 13.7 million litas in total.
The new 3,500 square meters hangar is expected to employ more than 60 skilled workers.
"The new hangar will be built near the existing Ryanair's hangar," Jurate Baltrusaityte, director of commerce at 
Kaunas airport, told BNS.
With the project implemented, Kaunas Aircraft Maintenance Services will be able to handle two aircraft 
simultaneously, the press release says. Ryanair currently handles one aircraft per week at its existing aircraft 
maintenance and repair hangar at the airport of Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city.
The first Ryanair's aircraft maintenance and service center at Kaunas airport was officially opened in January. The 
budget carrier invested 16 million litas in the facility.
The Irish airline has aircraft maintenance and service centers in Britain and Germany. Ryanair is active in the 
airports of Vilnius and Kaunas.

Air Lituanica to expand flight geography from Lithuania, CEO says
VILNIUS, Feb 08, BNS - Air Lituanica, an airline company being created by the local authority of Vilnius, will seek to 
expand the geography of flights from Lithuania instead of competing with established air carriers.
The new company planned to launch flights as early as in June, Erikas Zubras, newly appointed CEO of Air 
Lituanica, told BNS.
"I, personally, see potential benefits in the existence of such a carrier in Lithuania," he said.
Asked whether Air Lituanica would manage to compete with low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air, which were 
active in the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas, Zubrus said that the new company would not compete on the same 
routes.
"Our initial plans do not envisage any direct competition either with budget or with other carriers. The purpose of our 
project is for Air Lituanica to grow and to look, as far as possible, for partnership with major carriers, starting from 
Air France, KLM, Scandinavian carriers," Zubrus, whose appointment as CEO of Air Lituanica came into effect on 
Jan. 29, told BNS.
Air Lituanica submitted the documents required to obtain an air carrier's license to the Civil Aviation Administration 
(CAA) last week.
Zubrus previously held executive positions at Small Planet Airlines and Agrowill Group, the agricultural investment 
group. He also owned a stake in collapsed Star1 Airlines.
Air Lituanica plans to offer flights to Amsterdam, Brussels, Kiev, London and Moscow from Vilnius, Kaunas and 
Palanga in the first year of its operations and later open six new routes, to Stockholm, Munich, Berlin, St. 
Petersburg, Hamburg and Tbilisi. It also intends to add flights to Istanbul to its schedule from 2015.

Ryanair invests EUR 1.5 mln in maintenance hangar at Kaunas airport - CEO
VILNIUS, Jan 30, BNS - Ryanair has invested 1.5 million euros in its maintenance hangar at Kaunas Airport, which 
launched operations this month, the Irish carrier's chief executive officer said on Wednesday.

"It means that we have a long-term commitment to Kaunas. It also encourages us to look at more routes, to look at 
more opportunities to grow traffic and tourism here at the airport of Kaunas," he said at a news conference.
O'Leary said that Ryanair's maintenance base in Kaunas employs 40 specialists. It can accommodate one aircraft 
at a time and performs C type maintenance checks, which are "the second-most serious", he said.
The CEO noted that Ryanair was the first foreign company to invest in an aircraft maintenance base in Lithuania.
The Irish airline has aircraft maintenance and service centers in Britain and Germany. In Lithuania, it currently offers 
flights from the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas.

Ryanair set to open aircraft service center at Kaunas airport
VILNIUS, Jan 29, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair is officially opening an aircraft maintenance and service 
center at Kaunas Airport, in which it is has invested around 16 million litas (EUR 4.6 mln).
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is expected to announce this in Kaunas on Wednesday, Kaunas Airport CEO Povilas 
Ugianskis told BNS on Tuesday.
"As far as I understand, there will be an announcement about the opening of the aircraft technical base. Also, I 
hope, there will be an opportunity to discuss further cooperation. Ryanair's center has just launched operations. It 
has been a week or two since they obtained all the permits to operate here. It seems that there is a plane in the 
hangar at the moment," he told BNS.
Ugianskis said that, to his knowledge, the center employs a workforce of around 50 people.
Ryanair in late March 2012 won an auction announced by Kaunas Airport for the lease of a land plot for the 
construction of an aircraft maintenance center.
It was announced in November 2011 that the Irish carrier was planning to invest 12 million litas in the center and 
expected to receive another 4.143 million litas in EU financial support.
It was said that Ryanair's center would have 60 employees and that its hangar would be large enough to 
accommodate at least one aircraft of the size of a Boeing 737 plane.
The Irish airline has aircraft maintenance and service centers in Britain and Germany.

Competition watchdog has no objections to discounts planned by Riga airport
RIGA, Jan 10, BNS - The Latvian Competition Council has no objections to the plans by Riga International Airport 
to re-introduce discounts to airlines for launching new routes and increasing the number of passengers.
Competition Council's spokeswoman Inita Kabanova told BNS that the competition watchdog had reviewed the 
draft regulations prepared by the Transport Ministry about the fees for Riga airport's services and approved them 
while making several suggestions as regards wording.
But Riga airport as the dominant market player is particularly responsible for making sure that its actions, including 
setting the airport charges, would not interfere with the competition on the aviation market, Kabanova said.
The new regulations about fees for services provided by Riga airport have been presented at a meeting of state 
secretaries. Contrary to the existing regulations, the new rules provide for discounts on the fees for passenger 
services and aircraft ground time for the airlines which have launched new routes or have increased the number of 
departing passengers from the year before.
The Transport Ministry said that the conclusion from comparing the fees in Riga airport and foreign airports was that 
airports tended to reduce the fees and to offer carriers different forms of payment. Another growing trend is the 
increase of non-aviation revenue against aviation revenue with growing passenger numbers being an important 
factor for this.
For the new discounts on airport fees to take effect, they still have to be approved by the Latvian government.
At present there is no differentiation of fees at Riga airport. Such tariff policy took effect on November 1, 2009, 
when Riga  airport  ceased to apply volume discounts that were previously enjoyed by the airlines serving the 
Competition watchdog has no objections to discounts planned by Riga airport
largest number of passengers - the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and the Latvian national airline Airbaltic. The 
Competition Council also objected to such discounts at the time.
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company.

lease contract with Aviabaltika, the winner of the auction. This is the largest piece of land ever leased by the airport.
Jurate Baltrusaityte, Kaunas Airport's commercial director, could not tell BNS how much Aviabaltika is planning to 
invest in the project, saying that the company is still making the estimates.
Baltrusaityte said that this is Aviabaltika's second investment project at Kaunas Airport. The company is building a 
helicopter repair and maintenance hangar on a 4,800-square-meter plot of land adjoining the apron.
Ryanair, Avia Solutions Group and Dot LT are also investing in Kaunas Airport after winning land lease auctions. 
Norway's investment company Alsco is building a hotel at the airport in partnership with Lithuania's Air Hotel.

Kaunas Airport businesses laying off employees - daily
VILNIUS, Nov 26, BNS - Businesses rendering services in the Lithuanian airport of Kaunas are unaware whether 
they will still be working in the airport in spring when the number of flights from Kaunas will reportedly increase 
again since the number of routes from the airport has now been reduced to five, from twenty previously, the Kauno 
Diena daily reports on Monday.
Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair now has only sixteen flights per week in Kaunas and all of them are mostly used by 
the Lithuanians working abroad.
Businessmen renting premises in the airport intend to ask the airport's administration to consider their 
circumstances.
They put the blame for their hardships on the Transport Ministry, which said that Kaunas would hold the niche of 
cheap flights. However, in reality Ryanair moved most of its flights to Vilnius.

Ryanair to restore most flights to Tallinn in spring
TALLINN, Nov 23, BNS - The Irish cheap flights airline, Ryanair, confirmed the information in accordance with 
which the airline would restore at least five air routes to Tallinn.
Elina Hakkarainen, Ryanair's Nordic and Baltic countries' market and sales director, told BNS that reopening of five 
routes had been endorsed and tickets to the routes could be bought from the web site of the company. "We are 
working at the summer timetable and all the destinations will be endorsed during the next couple of weeks, 
Hakkarainen said. "Also opening of the Bremen and Frankfurt Hahn destinations would be made during the next 
few weeks."
It appears from the Ryanair web site that flights to Dublin would be renewed from March 16, to the Girona Airport 
near Barcelona  and to Manchester on March 25 and to Dusseldorf Weeze and to Stockholm Skavsta from March 
26. As of Friday, no tickets were being sold to Bremen and Frankfurt Hahn.
For the winter season Ryanair stopped for this October and November seven routees  out of ten and until March 
and until March it is possible to fly Ryanair to London Luton, Oslo Rygge and Milano Bergamo.
Last year 376,849 passengers flew via Tallinn, 20 percent of the passengers that used the Tallinn Airport.

Ryanair to resume many flights from Kaunas in spring
(updates, expands)
VILNIUS, Nov 14, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair, which has moved most of its routes from Kaunas to 
Vilnius for the winter season, plans to resume flights to a number of destinations from the country's second-biggest 
city next spring, Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis said in a message on his Facebook page.
"Just as we expected, Ryanair will resume many flights at Kaunas Airport in spring. Tickets to flights to nine 
destinations, starting from the end of March, have already been put on sale. The final schedule will be known 
somewhat later," the minister wrote.
Martynas Cerkauskas, the minister's advisor, told BNS that he thinks that Ryanair's decision to offer more flights 
from Kaunas is due to a seasonal increase in passenger numbers in summer.
"Passenger traffic is always bigger in summer than in winter. Seasonality has a great impact. Both Lithuanians fly 
more often in summer and more people fly to Lithuania," he said.
Ryanair currently operates flights from Kaunas Airport to Bristol, Dublin, Frankfurt and London Standsted. The 
airline next spring plans to resume flights from Lithuania's second-biggest city to London Gatwick, Birmingham, 
Edinburgh, Palma, Malta and Alicante.
The Irish carrier, which entered the Lithuanian market in September 2005, has recently moved its Brussels, Leeds, 
Liverpool, Luton, Cork and Oslo flights from Kaunas to Vilnius after the capital's airport offered discounts and due to 
competition with another low-fare airline, Hungary's Wizz Air.

Ryanair moves flights from Kaunas to Vilnius
VILNIUS, Nov 07, BNS - Ireland's budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday launched flights from Vilnius to six new 
destinations.
The Irish carrier, which entered the Lithuanian market in September 2005 and until recently operated most of its 
routes from Kaunas, has moved its Brussels, Leeds, Liverpool, Luton, Cork and Oslo flights to Vilnius after the 
airport offered discounts and due to competition with another low-fare airline, Hungary's Wizz Air.
Ryanair is also planning to launch a route between Vilnius and the German city of Duesseldorf in the middle of next 
March. It will continue to operate flights from Kaunas Airport to Bristol, Dublin, Frankfurt and London.
According to the media, the relocation of Ryanair's routes to Vilnius may cause financial difficulties to Kaunas 
Airport and deliver a blow to the country's second-largest city.
Kaunas Airport became the fastest growing airport in Europe in 2010 after the Irish carrier established its first 
Central and Eastern European base in Kaunas.

Passenger traffic at Kaunas airport up 5.5 pct in Jan-Oct y/y
VILNIUS, Nov 05, BNS - A total of 777,000 passengers went through Kaunas International Airport, the second-
largest airport in Lithuania, in January through October, up 5.5 percent from the same period last year.
The number of flights increased by 2 percent, year-on-year, to nearly 7,800.
The airport closed its summer season successfully yet starting from November, the number of destinations 
accessible by air from Lithuania's second-largest city would decline, the airport's management said.
"We lived up to the title of the summer holiday airport this past summer - the travelers chose us more often than last 
year," Jurate Baltrusaityte, acting CEO of the airport, said in a press release.
However, passenger traffic through the airport will decline from November as Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair will 
move five routes from Kaunas to Vilnius on Nov. 7. During the winter season, the airport of Kaunas will continue to 
offer flights to Bristol, Dublin, Frankfurt and London.
The airport last year handled 872,000 passengers, up 7.8 percent from 2010.

Five carriers increase number of flights from Riga this winter
(adds info from Airbaltic)
RIGA, Oct 26, BNS - Five carriers have increased the number of their flights from Riga to a total of 18 destinations 
this winter season, Riga airport spokeswoman Sarmite Rinmane told BNS.
The carriers have increased the number of flights to destinations like Amsterdam, Brussels, Moscow, Vienna, 
London, Munich and Paris among others. The winter flight schedule also includes two new destinations -- 
Manchester and Salzburg, and Bremen has returned in the schedule of flights from Riga.
Already from November 7, Irish low-costs airline Ryanair will start flying passengers to Manchester in the UK and 
will resume flights to the German city of Bremen on November 8.
The Riga airport spokeswoman said that this winter Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier will offer flights to Budapest 
and Chisinau, while Norwegian Air will be flying passengers to Copenhagen.
Wizz Air has also increased the number of flights this winter, as the airline is planning seven flights a week to 
London (Luton) and three flights a week to Eindhoven. Airbaltic, too, is set to increase the number of its flights to 
ten flights a week to Amsterdam, 12 flights a week to Brussels, 19 flights a week to Moscow and nine flights a week 
to Munich.
Aistrian Airlines Group's Lauda Air will continue to provide chartered flights from Riga to Insbruck and Salzburg, and 
AMC Airlines will be flying to Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh.
Airbaltic vice-president for corporate relations Janis Vanags told BNS that during his winter season the Latvian 
carrier would increase the number of flights on the Riga-London route to eight a week from seven flights a week last 
winter. The number of flights on the Riga-Paris route will grow from seven to nine a week.
Five carriers increase number of flights from Riga this winter
The number of Airbaltic flights between Riga and Brussels  will grow from eight to ten a week. On the Riga-
Amsterdam route, the number of Airbaltic flights will grow from seven to nine a week.
At the same time, the number of flights on the Riga-Vienna and Riga-Munich routes will be raised from seven to ten 
a week, and on the Riga-Dusseldorf route from four to five a week.
On the route between Riga and the Danish city of Billund the Latvian carrier will increase the number of flights from 
three to four a week, and the number of flights between Riga and the Norwegian city of Bergen will grow from three 
to four a week. On the Riga-Oslo route, Airbaltic will increase the number of flights to 20 a week.

Latvia's MEP demands European Commission to explain possibly unfair competition of Irish low-cost carrier 
Ryanair at Riga airport
RIGA, Oct 09, BNS - Latvia's MEP Krisjanis Karins has asked the European Commission to explain the possibly 
unfair competition of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair at the Riga international airport, Karins' spokeswoman Ieva 
Ziberga reported.
She said that Karins has sent an official letter to the European Commission, demanding explanation about possibly 
unfair competition of Ryanair at the Riga airport and the commission's planned activities to protect interests of 
customers.
Karins said in his letter that the international airport Riga is a significant regional traffic hub -- the biggest airport in 
the Baltic states, serving 17 airlines. "As administration costs are growing, the management of the airport decided 
to collect security fees in the amount of seven euros per passenger. The security fees refer to those passengers 
who have to undergo security control before their flights, and it came into effect as of Jan. 1, 2012. The only airline 
that disagreed to include the security fee in the ticket price is Ryanair, which is why each passenger has to 
additionally pay this fee before the flight," said Karins.
According to Ziberga, Karins has asked the European Commission to assess whether Ryanair in this way is 
deceiving passengers about the actual ticket price and whether the airline does not breach the European 
Parliament and Council regulations on air transportation service providers in the European Union (EU). Karins also 
wants to know what the European Commission plans to do to improve the situation that is unfavorable to 
consumers and competition.
Latvia 's MEP demands European Commission to explain possibly unfair competition of Irish low-cost carrier 
Ryanair at Riga airport
Ziberga also said that the Latvian Consumers Rights Protection Center, based on complaints of customers, has 
asked the responsible authority in Ireland to revise Ryanair's activities.
The European Commission has to reply to the official letter in four weeks.
From Jan. 1, 2012, passengers at the Riga international airport are charged a security fee of 6.5-7 euros. The 
security fee is 6.5 euros, if the passenger pays it through the air carrier upon purchase of the airline ticket, and 7 
euros, if the passenger pays it before the security check at the airport.
Riga airport, a fully state-owned company, is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. In 2011, Riga airport 
served 5.107 million passengers.

FlyLAL's dispute with Riga Airport, Airbaltic to remain in Lithuanian courts
(expands)
VILNIUS, Oct 02, BNS - Claims for damages worth almost 200 million litas (EUR 58 mln) brought by the now-
bankrupt FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines against Riga Airport and Latvia's air carrier Airbaltic will continue to be heard in 
Lithuanian courts as the country's Appeals Court did not allow to move the lawsuit to Latvia.
The Appeals Court said in its Sept. 27 ruling that the case would not be handed over to Latvian courts because 
FlyLAL had filed the suit seeking damages it claimed to have suffered in Vilnius Airport's geographical market due 
to unfair competition.
The Appeal Court's spokeswoman, Kristina Petrosiene, confirmed to BNS that the ruling can be appealed to the 
Lithuanian Supreme Court.
The Appeals Court thus upheld the Vilnius Regional Court's decision, made in February, to reject a request from 
Riga Airport and Airbaltic to decline jurisdiction over the dispute in favor of a Latvian court.
The Riga Airport argued that there were no legal grounds for hearing the case in Lithuanian courts after FlyLAL had 
revised its claims and removed Airbaltic's Lithuanian branch from the list of defendants.
FlyLAL says in its suit that suffered losses in Lithuania due to allegedly unfair competition practices by the 
defendants, according to the Appeals Court's ruling.
Latvia's competition authority ruled in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and favored 
two companies -- Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.  The neighboring country's corruption watchdog later started a 
case regarding Riga Airport's contracts with air carriers.
FlyLAL's dispute with Riga Airport , Airbaltic to remain in Lithuanian courts
FlyLAL seeks to prove that Riga Airport provided Airbaltic with discounts that discriminated against its Lithuanian 
competitor.
FlyLAL in early 2009 suspended its operations due to financial troubles. Shortly afterwards, Airbaltic moved the 
majority of its flights from Vilnius to its hub in Riga.

Lithuania's Court of Appeal upholds seizure of EUR 58 mln worth Riga Airport's property
(expands)
VILNIUS, Oct 02, BNS - The airport of Riga has failed to convince the Lithuanian Court of Appeal into lifting the 
seizure on its nearly 200 million litas (EUR 58 mln) worth property, which was imposed back in 2008 at the request 
of Lithuania's collapsed FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines that accused the airport of unfair competition.
The airport attempted to redirect FlyLAL's claims to the Latvian state saying that it was only implementing the 
government's decisions. "Hence the liability for reimbursement lies with the Republic of Latvia," the Lithuanian 
Court of Appeal said in its Sept. 27 decision.
The court upheld the interim precautionary measures against the airport. The court concluded that the airport of 
Riga had failed to prove that its situation had changed so that there would be no difficulties in executing the court's 
decision in future.
The airport may still challenge this decision at the Lithuanian Supreme Court.
The airport of Riga attempted to convince the court that it had applied discounts to Airbaltic in compliance with the 
Latvian government's decisions. Moreover, the discounts were effective for all airline companies active in Riga.
"The claimant FlyLAL is only referring to the assumptions as regards potential unlawful agreement between the 
respondents and the discounts granted on the basis of that agreement, the size of those discounts, their use, the 
recipients of discounts, financial performance of the respondents," the airport pointed out. It noted that a decision 
on violations made in applying the discounts, which Latvia's competition watchdog adopted back in 2006, was 
annulled in July 2009 when the district administrative court of Riga terminated administrative proceedings.
Lithuania 's Court of Appeal upholds seizure of EUR 58 mln worth Riga Airport 's property
Latvia 's Competition Council ruled in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and favored 
two companies -- Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.
FlyLAL seeks to prove that Riga Airport provided Airbaltic with discounts that were discriminatory against the 
Lithuanian airline.

Ryanair, Aer Lingus to reduce number of flights from Vilnius to Dublin - daily
VILNIUS, Sept 25, BNS - Ryanair and Aer Lingus will reduce the number of flights between Vilnius and Dublin 
during the winter season, the Lietuvos Rytas daily reports on Tuesday.
"Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair intend to reduce the number of flights during the winter of 2012-2013. Both 
companies will offer two flights a week although last winter they offered three weekly flights. Both companies claim 
that the number of passengers is not increasing hence it is not worthwhile to offer more flights," Simonas Bartkus, 
director of commerce department at Vilnius International Airport, told the daily.
Meanwhile, Ryanair will in November launch flights between Vilnius and Cork.

Finnair manager sees growth opportunities mainly in Asian direction
TALLINN, Sep 07, BNS - The Finnish airline company Finnair sees Asia, where air traffic is growing constantly and 
at a very rapid rate, as its market niche and wants to double the number on its flights to Asia by 2020, CEO Mika 
Vehvilainen said at a press conference in Tallinn on Friday.
"In flights between Europe and Asia were are among the top three airlines," Vehvilainen told reporters. He added 
that while Finnair was unable to compete with large European carriers that fly between large European capitals and 
Asia, it saw its market share as primarily consisting of passengers from smaller cities that can be flown to Asia via 
Helsinki.
"Companies from Asia are growing and globalizing more and more, their sales are going very well," said 
Vehvilainen. He said that last year the number of people flying to China for the first time surpassed the number of 
people flying from China.
The biggest player in flights between Asia and Europe is Lufthansa, which has a market share of approximately 10 
percent. The market share of Finnair is somewhere around 5 percent.
Arunas Skuja, sales chief for Finnair in the Baltics, said Finnair was satisfied with its Estonian result in the first half 
of this year and also Finnair's Asia strategy worked very well in Estonia. Half-year sales by Finnair in Estonia grew 
19.9 percent and the number of passengers was up 21.2 percent year on year. Passengers of long-haul routes 
made up 46 percent of the total number of passengers and the number of those flying to Asia was up 20 percent.
Vehvilainen said being in the air transport business was not easy at the present time, as the results of airlines in the 
second quarter of this year were on the average 20 percent weaker than a year ago, the situation of the economy 
remains difficult and fuel prices high. "It is a very turbulent business," he said.
Finnair manager sees growth opportunities mainly in Asian direction
Low cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet are forcing also the old traditional airlines to look how to work with 
greater efficiency and lower costs, Vehvilainen said. Therefore a lot of mergers between airlines and cooperation 
can be seen, he added.

Air Maintenance Estonia opening new hangar at Tallinn Airport
TALLINN, Sep 05, BNS - Air Maintenance Estonia (AME) is about to inaugurate a new aircraft service and repair 
hangar at the Tallinn Airport on Wednesday, built at a cost of 10.5 million euros.
AME said in a press release that the new hangar will triple the company's maintenance capacity and create 
preconditions for expanding onto the Scandinavian and European markets.
"At AME we define our potential geographical market as being within 2.5 hours ferry flight time from our location at 
Tallinn Airport. This means that in addition to the Baltic countries, we also cover Northern and Central Europe, the 
UK, but also Northern Russia," CEO David Williams said.
With the addition of the new hangar the maximum annual line maintenance capacity of the company will rise to 72 
aircraft from the present 24.
The owner of the hangar is the state-owned company Tallinna Lennujaam (Tallinn Airport), with whom AME has 
concluded a 30-year lease.
AME belongs to the investment company Baltcap, which acquired it from SAS in 2010.
Air Maintenance Estonia's customers include SAS, Austrian Airlines, Easyjet, Norwegian, Ryanair, Lufthansa, 
Estonian Air, and other carriers.

Ryanair confirms plan to cut flights from Tallinn to three during winter
TALLINN, Sep 04, BNS - The Irish low cost carrier Ryanair confirmed on Tuesday that it will close five out of the 
eight routes it operates from Tallinn for the winter season.
Elina Hakkarainen, Ryanair's marketing and sales chief for the Nordic and Baltic region, told BNS the three flights 
from Tallinn that will remain are London Luton, Oslo Rygge and Milan Bergamo.
Hakkarainen said Ryanair was making cuts overall too as it was unable to offer prices low enough because of the 
high fuel prices, and was therefore closing five routes to Tallinn during the winter. "Hopefully we will be able to bring 
them all back by the next summer schedule," she said.
The marketing director of Tallinn Airport, Erik Sakkov, said earlier the airport company had no official word from 
Ryanair about the planned reductions yet.
"The information we have is that all airlines are flying less during the winter, the winter season starts here usually at 
the end of October," Sakkov told BNS on Tuesday. "Ryanair, too, intends to fly less, they've told us that. What the 
exact state of affairs will be is not official yet," he added.
The Seljakotirandur (Backpack traveler) website wrote on Monday that Ryanair will close most of its operations from 
Tallinn at the end of October and at the beginning of November. It said that during the winter there will be flights 
from Tallinn only to London Luton, Oslo Rygge and Milan Bergamo. The last flight to Stockholm Skavsta and 
Barcelona Girona will depart October 26, the last flight to Frankfurt Hahn on October 27, the last flight to 
Manchester and Duesseldorf Weeze on November 5, and the last flights to Dublin and Bremen on November 6.
As regards Ryanair operations in Riga, Duesseldorf Weeze and Liverpool will close after November 5, and 
Karsruhe after November 6, according to the website. On the other hand, flights to Manchester will open on 
November 7 and to Bremen on November 8. The flights to Brussels Charleroi, Dublin, East Midlands, Frankfurt

Lithuania's Litcargus will seek to gain footing in Poland
VILNIUS, Sept 04, BNS - Lithuania 's privately-owned ground handling company Litcargus will seek to gain a 
footing in neighboring Poland.
"Litcargus has plans to expand beyond Lithuania where it has already made the first steps. We seek to strengthen 
our positions and pursue targeted implementation of the company's strategic plans," Arijandas Sliupas, former CEO 
of Kaunas International Airport who has started as director of commerce at Litcargus this week, told BNS.
Litcargus would seek to gain a footing in Poland. The company had already established a subsidiary rendering 
services in one of Poland's airports, he said adding that Litcargus would also vie for orders from other airports in the 
neighboring country.
Sliupas said that he would be responsible for cooperation with the air carriers and the company's commercial 
strategy. Litcargus held about 50 percent of Lithuania's market, he said.
"Competition is strong in Lithuania but Litcargus has solid experience", Sliupas said.
Litcargus posted 1.532 million litas (EUR 0.44 mln) in audited net profit for 2011, down 44.3 percent from the year-
earlier figure of 2.75 million litas. The company's sales revenues last year shrank by 3.8 percent, year-on-year, to 
21.17 million litas.
Revenues on services provided to Airbaltic comprised 27.7 percent of Litcargus' total revenue last year. Ryanair 
accounted for 27.6 percent, Deutsche Lufthansa, for 10.3 percent, SAS, for 9 percent, Czech Airlines and Utair, for 
6 percent each.
Litcargus is fully-owned by Central European Airport Services.

Airbaltic decision to stop flights between Latvia, Ireland to affect bilateral economic relations - ambassador
RIGA, Aug 15, BNS - The decision by the Latvian national airline Airbaltic to stop flying to Ireland after September 
1, the beginning of the winter flight season, will have adverse effects on the Latvian-Irish economic relations, 
Latvian Ambassador to Ireland Peteris Karlis Elferts said in an interview with BNS.
"I hope that this decision is not final but at present you cannot buy any tickets [to the flights to Ireland] after 
September 1. This will definitely slow down the economic relations," he said.
The ambassador said that the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair would remain the only airline offering direct flights from 
Latvia to Ireland but business representatives would prefer flying with Airbaltic, if it continued to fly on the route.
"I do not quite see the reason for such decision as Ryanair flights are full and for them it certainly is one of the most 
profitable routes from Latvia," Elferts said.

Riga airport collects nearly EUR 3 mln in security fees in H1
RIGA, Jul 20, BNS - The international airport of Riga collected 2.1 million lats (EUR 2.98 mln) in security fees during 
the first half of 2012, the airport's communications head Sarmite Rinmane told BNS.
The airport's representative indicated that the revenue has gone to the budget of the airport's security department, 
which will spend it on security-related projects. "The money is being spent on security employees' wages, training, 
transport and maintenance, communications, materials, spare parts, as well as x-ray and other security equipment. 
Money is also needed for buying x- ray luggage scanners, as well as metal and explosives detectors in line with 
constantly changing and toughening security requirements," the airport's representative said.
Rinmane also informed that passengers of Ireland's low-costs carrier Ryanair can now pay the security fee by their 
bankcards at two self-service kiosks at Riga airport.
From Jan. 1, 2012, passengers at the Riga international airport are charged a security fee of 6.5-7 euros. The 
security fee is 6.5 euros, if the passenger pays it through the air carrier upon purchase of the airline ticket, and 7 
euros, if the passenger pays it before the security check at the airport.
Riga airport, a fully state-owned company, is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. In 2011, Riga airport 
served 5.107 million passengers.

Latvia's Tukums Airport holds talks with carriers, including Airbaltic, on using its airfield
RIGA, Jul 20, BNS - Tukums Airport, the operator of Tukums Jurmala airport, which is situated near the central 
Latvian town of Tukums, is holding talks with several foreign carriers and Latvia's national airline Airbaltic on using 
the airport for their operations, Marina Samuilova, an assistant to the Tukums Airport director, told BNS.
"Tukums Airport is holding negotiations with several foreign carriers as well as national airline Airbaltic as they have 
shown interest in using the services of Tukums Jurmala airfield," Samuilova said, adding that it is too early to 
disclose details about the talks.
She indicated that Tukums Airport agrees with the opinion of Riga airport CEO Arnis Luhse that from the strategic 
point of view the operations of so called low-costs airlines should be separated from those of full-service carriers 
because their basic requirements are different. "Also, from the financial point of view the need for the construction 
of an additional terminal at Riga airport is questionable given the untapped reserves at Tukums Jurmala airfield, 
which does not require public finances," said Samuilova.
The airport's representative said that the necessary work to provide air traffic control services at the airfield is being 
carried out in cooperation with Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme, the company in charge of managing air traffic in Latvia. 
"This work is due to be completed by the end of this year. Work is ongoing to improve the passenger terminal," 
Samuilova said, noting that Latvian Transport Minister Aivis Ronis is expected to arrive and inspect the airport in 
person in the nearest future.
Riga airport CEO Luhse said in an interview with BNS earlier that from the strategic point of view low-costs airlines 
like Ireland's Ryanair should operate at Tukums airport and that it is difficult for Riga airport to serve both the low-
costs and full-service carriers.
Latvia 's Tukums Airport holds talks with carriers, including Airbaltic, on using its airfield
Established in 2005, Tukums Airport has a share capital of 3.013 million lats (EUR 4.28 mln). The company belongs 
to the local authority of Engure district (4.25 pct) and K.S.AVIA company (95.75 pct).

Riga International Airport expected to make minimal profit this year - CEO
RIGA, Jul 09, BNS - Riga International Airport in the Latvian capital is expected to make minimal net profit this year, 
CEO Arnis Luhse said in an interview with BNS, adding that the airport was likely to serve close to five million 
passengers in 2012.
"The net profit is going to be minimal but operating profit is planned around two million lats (EUR 2.85 mln), just like 
last year, and we will again put it into reserves which we need for development," Luhse said.
While the Riga airport expects its financial results this year to remain on the 2011 level, the number of passengers 
will be lower.
"This year we expect to serve 4.6 million passengers, which is in line with the plans submitted by airlines. But I think 
that this figure will be a little higher because we served1.8 million passengers already in the first five months, which 
is only by 70-80 thousand less than during the same period last year," the airport's CEO said.
He said that the number of passengers carried y the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair probably will not drop this year 
but a reduction in passenger numbers was expected for the Latvian national airline Airbaltic.
"There probably won't be a large decline [in passenger numbers] for Ryanair. Yes, they closed the routes to 
Bremen and Rome but they also launched a new route to Karslruhe/Baden-Baden," Luhse said.
"The number of Airbaltic passengers, in particular transit passengers, is falling, but it is their new strategy - to 
reduce the focus on transit passengers. Moreover, they plan that by fall their passenger numbers will be back to the 
same level as in fall last year. Therefore I think that the total number of passengers this year could be close to five 
million in absence of any global problems," the Riga airport's CEO said.
In 2011, the Riga airport served 5.107 million passengers, up by 9.5 percent from 2010.

Talks of Riga airport, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair on security fees have brought no results - airport head
RIGA, Jul 06, BNS - Talks between international airport Riga and Irish low-cost airline Ryanair on security fees 
have not brought any results yet, said the airport's board chairman Arnis Luhse in an interview with BNS.
He said that talks with the airline on the security fees so that Ryanair passengers would not have to pay the fees 
separately, but the fee is included in the ticket price, are held all the time. "Talks are being held all the time, but no 
results yet. Ryanair at present is not interested to change anything. Besides, they refused to post information about 
security fees on their Internet website, and the passengers are not warned, and it is a big problem," said Luhse.
Luhse said that Ryanair has a childish attitude in this respect. "They reply is quite simple - bad people do not fly 
with Ryanair. This attitude is rather childish because if anything happens, the airport will be blamed for not ensuring 
sufficient security. Of course, their idea is that the ticket should be as cheap as possible. Other airlines are paying 
the fees, either adding it to the ticket price or in another way," he said.
He said that there are two security fee systems in the world - it is covered by the state or the passenger, if Latvia 
has honestly said that it has no money in a budget. "It could also be understood because why a lady in a Latvian 
town should pay with her taxes for a guy who is checked at the airport if she has never flown in her life. Then only 
those who fly pay the fee. On the other hand, an airport is a very important state infrastructure object," said the 
airport head.
From Jan. 1, 2012, passengers at the Riga international airport are charged a  security  fee of 6.5-7 euros. The 
security fee is 6.5 euros, if the passenger pays it through the air carrier upon purchase of the airline ticket, and 7 
euros, if the passenger pays it before the security check at the airport.

Tallinn airport serves almost 21 percent more passengers y-o-y in June
TALLINN, Jul 05, BNS - The airport of Tallinn served 225,455 passengers in June, 20.6 percent more than in the 
same month last year.
Compared to May, the number of passengers grew by 4.5 percent, statistics of the state-owned airport operator 
Tallinna Lennujaam show.
Passengers on international flights numbered 223,107. The figure marks an increase of 21.3 percent in annual 
comparison.
The airport handled 1,296 tons of goods during the month, 21.5 percent less than a year ago.
The number of flights via the airport increased by 27.1 percent year-on-year to a total of 4,757.
In the first half of the year the airport served 1.06 million passengers, 21.4 percent more than the year before.
Helsinki, Stockholm and Riga were the most popular destinations for regular flights. The airport offered direct flights 
to 37 destinations in the first half of the year. Among charter flight destinations, Antalya in Turkey and Egyptian 
resorts of Hurghada and Sharm el Sheikh topped the list. In the last two months no charter flights to Egypt took 
place.
According to the Tallinn airport, 40.1 percent of the passengers flew the national carrier Estonian Air and 16.2 
percent the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. A year ago Estonian Air's share of passenger flows was 31 percent and 
Ryanair's 19 percent.
The six-month freight turnover totaled 10,528 tons, 46.9 percent more in annual comparison, and the number of 
flights grew 26.5 percent to 24,166.

Latvian natl airline Airbaltic has to compete not only with airlines flying to Riga - CEO
RIGA, Jun 29, BNS - The Latvian national airline Airbaltic has to compete not only with the airlines flying to Riga but 
also with the airlines operating in the entire region, Airbaltic CEO, Martin  Gauss, said in an interview with BNS.
,,We have competition from everywhere now. Whoever serves Riga is a competitor. Somebody like Estonian Air 
who has just started one route to Riga is a new competitor. But they are still quite small compared to us so the 
threat is not as big," he said.
Gauss said that Ryanair has a lot of capacity and therefore was a big threat, especially if they flew on the same 
routes as Airbaltic. But the opposite has happened as Airbaltic is going to benefit from the Ryanair decision to stop 
flights to Rome, he said.
,,But there is also competition which we do not see in Riga because we do so much transfer traffic. You can go with 
us to Budapest, and we take passengers from Finland to Budapest. They can go from Finland via Copenhagen, 
they can go via Warsaw, Prague, Stockholm. So our competition is not only in Riga, our competition is within in the 
region - Finnair, even SAS, their code-share partner KLM, even the Czech Airlines," the Airbaltic CEO said.
Speaking about the main threats to Airbaltic, Gauss said: ,,Our biggest threat currently is fuel prices going even 
higher, followed by competition. Because, of course, competition is keeping the prices down. If we are not operating 
at our cost level, we produce losses."
,,As there are competitors like Ryanair, who could produce for lower cost because they have a better cost base, 
that could be a problem. But of course, anybody coming to compete with us, who has a better potential base than 
we have, is a potential threat. This is threat, not a risk. Currently in our business planning we foresee high fuel 
price, we foresee a US dollar exchange rate at a proper level and we foresee that competition will grow here 
Latvian natl airline Airbaltic has to compete not only with airlines flying to Riga - CEO
stronger than we have grown. This is the basis of the business plan because we have stopped dreaming, we have 
come back to real development. I hope, of course, that we will be able after the consolidation phase to start growing 
again. If we do not grow in the future, it is not sustainable. You cannot maintain the airline at one size and continue 
making profits," the Airbaltic CEO said.

Lithuania's flyLAL court case against Riga airport, Airbaltic is nonsense - Airbaltic CEO
RIGA, Jun 19, BNS - Martin Gauss, the board chairman of Latvian national carrier Airbaltic, does not understand 
the claim of Lithuania's bankrupt airline flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines (flyLAL) against international airport Riga and 
Airbaltic.
Gauss said in an interview with BNS that the flyLAL case has an impact on the airport, even Irish low-cost airline 
Ryanair is affected. "What I don't understand - somebody goes bankrupt, then he blames somebody else for it. 
Thus, the whole case is a nonsense," he said.
Gauss said that the company now just has to wait for the outcome. "I still trust in justice. Somebody whose 
company has bad management, cannot blame somebody else for it," he said.
Riga Regional Court on June 12 upheld the January 19 ruling of Riga City Vidzeme District Court, which satisfied 
the lawsuit of Lithuania's bankrupt airline flyLAL -Lithuanian Airlines seeking the recognition and enforcement of a 
Lithuanian court's ruling freezing assets of Riga airport and Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier. The latest court ruling 
has thus upheld the arrest of 40 million lats (EUR 57 mln) worth of Riga airport and Airbaltic assets.
The ruling can be appealed.
FlyLal said in its claim that it had suffered a loss of almost 40.8 million lats because the Riga airport had set for 
Airbaltic more favorable terms, which enabled the Latvian airline to set lower prices on its flights and to weaken its 
competitors.
In November 2004 Riga airport introduced a price policy under which the size of the airport's fees depended on the 
number of air passengers carried by each airline. In November 2006, the Latvian Competition Council ordered the 
airport to end this discount policy, on the grounds that it contained elements of abuse of dominant position.
Lithuania 's flyLAL court case against Riga airport, Airbaltic is nonsense - Airbaltic CEO
In November 2009, Riga airport launched a new price policy, giving up the previous discount system, which had 
favored Ireland's Ryanair and Latvia's Airbaltic that served a large number of passengers in Riga.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from all three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn. Airbaltic was founded in 1995, 
and the Latvia state with 99.8 a percent stake is its largest shareholder. Airbaltic flew 3.351 million passengers in 
2011 at a 5 percent increase from a year before.
Lithuanian national airline flyLAL went bankrupt in 2009.

Ryanair to scrap flights from Kaunas to Greek islands in Oct
VILNIUS, Jun 18, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair in October will scrap flights from various airports, including 
Lithuania's Kaunas, to the Greek islands of Rhodes and Kos, Vilniaus Diena and Kauno Diena reported.
Stephen McNamara, Ryanair's head of communications, has confirmed to the daily papers that the airline in mid-
May took the decision to cancel flights to Rhodes and Kos.
"Ryanair is closing routes from various countries to Kos and 13 routes to Rhodes in early October. We estimate that 
as a result of this, the two Greek islands will lose 23,000 tourists and 18 million euros that could have been brought 
to the Greek economy during October," he said.
The local Greek authorities failed to honor an agreement to promote Ryanair routes to Kos and Rhodes, McNamara 
said.

Court experts to assess losses possibly suffered by FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines due to Riga Airport, Airbaltic duo
VILNIUS, May 30, BNS - Court experts will try to establish the losses possibly sustained by FlyLAL-Lithuanian 
Airlines, the Lithuanian airline in bankruptcy, which puts the blame for its financial difficulties on Riga Airport and 
Latvia's air carrier Airbaltic.
Gintautas Stalnionis, a spokesman for Vilnius Regional Court, told BNS that the court decided on examination on 
Apr. 26.
"The court ordered an examination in these proceedings so as to assess the damages possibly sustained by 
FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines between 2004 and 2008," he said.
Moreover, on Mar. 1 the Vilnius Regional Court turned down a request from Riga Airport and Airbaltic to lift the 
seizure on 199.83 million litas (EUR 57.92 mln) worth of their property in Lithuania, Stalnionis confirmed to BNS.
The Vilnius Regional Court on Feb. 9 rejected Riga Airport and Airbaltic's request that it decline jurisdiction in favor 
of Latvian courts and ordered Airbaltic to provide information about its performance results and those of its 
Lithuanian branch in 2004 through 2008.
FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines seeks to prove that Riga Airport provided Airbaltic with discounts that were 
discriminatory against the Lithuanian airline.
Latvia 's Competition Council ruled in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and favored 
two companies - Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair. Latvia's corruption watchdog later started a case regarding Riga 
Airport's contracts with air carriers.

Kaunas' arrears for advertising by Ryanair keep growing - daily
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS - The local authorities of Lithuania's second largest city of Kaunas and Kaunas district have 
missed the deadline for transferring the money paid for the advertising by Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair by 
Kaunas International Airport, the Lietuvos Rytas daily reports on Thursday.
"As far as we know, quite many obligations will not be fulfilled. This will create a precedent for the other party to 
renege on its commitments as well. We do not want the number of flights at Kaunas airport to decline," Transport 
Minister Eligijus Masiulis told the daily.
Meanwhile, the mayors of Kaunas city and Kaunas district claim that the promises would be kept albeit at a later 
date. However, they point out that Ryanair has hit a hard and unexpected blow by cancelling or transferring some 
flights to Vilnius.
"If we had known that Ryanair would behave this way, we would not have coordinated such an agreement. We will 
have to modify the agreements and partnership with the airport in future," Kaunas District Mayor Valerijus Makunas 
told the daily.

Ryanair recognizes its debt to Latvian air traffic controller, starts paying it off
RIGA, May 11, BNS - The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has recognized its debt to the Latvian state-owned air traffic 
control company Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (LGS) and has started paying off the debt, LGS head Davids Taurins said 
in the interview to the Latvian business daily Dienas Bizness.
He said that LGS had received a letter from Ryanair in which the airline had promised to pay the full amount of the 
debt by September this year.
When the debt is settled, the court proceedings between the two parties would be terminated. At present a court 
sitting has been scheduled for October 25. "Hopefully, by that time Ryanair would have delivered on its promise and 
paid the money as well as signed an agreement with LGS about further cooperation in line with the respective EU 
regulation and the Latvian legislation. But for now the court proceedings have only been suspended," Taurins said.
He said that Ryanair still had to pay to LGS 534,000 euros. "So far we have received from the airline two payments 
- one for 201,000 euros and the other for 164,000 euros. Thus, the total amount paid so far is 365,000 euros," the 
LGS head said.
He said he expected the parties to settle the dispute amicably, considering that they had already switched from 
confrontation to constructive cooperation.
LGS filed a lawsuit against Ryanair for collection of a debt fro air navigation services. The state-owned Riga 
International Airport is also involved in this lawsuit.
LGS is a fully state-owned company providing air navigation services to air space users in Latvia. Last year LGS 
guided 236,400 flights at a 10 percent increase from 2010.

Kaunas airport's Q1 passenger traffic down 7 pct to 208,000
VILNIUS, Apr 25, BNS - A total of 208,000 passengers went through Kaunas International Airport, the second-
largest airport in Lithuania, during the first quarter pf this year, down 7 percent compared with a year ago.
"The result was due to Ryanair's flights from Vilnius and the company's competition with Wizz Air. Looking back at 
2010, we had services to Milan and Barcelona, which were relocated to Vilnius in the summer season (of 2011). 
This explains the decline," Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas told BNS.
The airport posted a 7.8 percent increase in annual passenger traffic to 872,000 in 2011.

Ireland's Ryanair emerges as leader of Lithuania's flight market in 2011
VILNIUS, Mar 27, BNS - Ireland 's budget carrier Ryanair was the leader of Lithuania's market in terms of 
passenger traffic on regular flights in 2011, according to the data made available by the Civil Aviation Administration 
(CAA).
Ryanair last year accounted for 43 percent of Lithuania's passengers on regular flights, up 8 points from 2010, the 
regulator said. Latvia's Airbaltic ranked second with a 11 percent share (down 5 points) and was followed by 
Hungary's Wizzair with 9 percent.
"Hungary's air carrier Wizzair occupied the niche, which emerged after the suspension of operations by Star1 
Airlines in October 2010," CAA said in a report.
Scandinavia's SAS last year held 7 percent of Lithuania's flight market and Germany's Lufthansa had a 6 percent 
slice.
As estimated by the CAA, the regular flights market share held by Lithuania's carrier Small Planet Airlines last year 
plunged to 0.01 percent, from 9 percent.
Other competitors on Lithuania's regular flights market also included Finland's Finnair, Czech Airlines, Estonian Air, 
Poland's LOT, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Russia's uTair Aviation, AeroSvit Airlines, Ireland's Aerlingus, Austrian 
Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Sweden's Skyways Express and Lithuania's regular flights market newcomers, Russia's

Ryanair hopes to carry 400,000 Estonian passengers this year
TALLINN, Mar 26, BNS - The Irish carrier Ryanair that served 350,000 passengers in Estonia last year hopes to 
increase the number to 400,000 this year, sales and marketing manager Elina Hakkarainen said.
Ryanair's market share in the three Baltic states grew by 39 percent over the past year. Hakkarainen said the airline 
plans to continue expanding in Estonia. "We certainly have to review our flight frequencies and possible new 
destinations so as to be able to continue growing," she said.
The company is also looking at potential new winter destinations but Hakkarainen was unwilling to make them 
known before confirmation. "We are studying various destinations that would attract enough passengers so that we 
could keep ticket prices low," she said. In her words, the airline is determined to launch flights to at least a couple 
new destinations out of Estonia next year.
This year Ryanair is offering two new destinations to Estonian passengers -- Manchester and Frankfurt Hahn. It 
discontinued flights between Tallinn and Edinburgh.
Ryanair currently flies from Tallinn to Duesseldorf, Stockholm, Oslo, Dublin, Milan, London, Bremen, Barcelona, 
Manchester and Frankfurt Hahn.

Ryanair wins auction to lease land plot at Kaunas Airport
VILNIUS, Mar 23, BNS - Ireland 's budget carrier Ryanair has won an auction announced by Kaunas Airport for the 
lease of a land plot for the construction of an aircraft storage and maintenance hangar, Kaunas Airport CEO, 
Arijandas Sliupas, has confirmed to BNS.
"We have the winner but have not signed the contract as yet. It is Ryanair," Sliupas told BNS on Friday adding that 
the winner was announced on Tuesday.
The documents required for the signing of the contract had already been sent to Ryanair, he said.
Ryanair, which was the sole bidder, offered to pay an annual fee of 2,900 litas (EUR 840.58, VAT included), which 
matched the initial price, for the lease of a 3,700 square meters land plot.
Last November the Economy Ministry and Michael Hickey, Director of Engineering at Ryanair, signed a letter of 
intent on Ryanair's investments. As reported then, the air carrier would invest 12 million litas (EUR 3.48 mln) in the 
center. Further 4.143 million litas were planned to be allocated from the European Union's (EU) structural funds. As 
planned, Ryanair's center will employ a workforce of 60.
The hangar has to be of appropriate size to accommodate at least one Boeing 737 type aircraft or other type/model 
aircrafts of no less size. Moreover, the construction of the hangar shall be finished within twelve months.
Ryanair has MRO units in the United Kingdom and Germany.
The air carrier now offers flights from Vilnius and Kaunas.

President endorses construction of Visaginas NPP
Latvia will benefit from participation in Lithuania's nuclear power plant (NPP) project, because it is economically 
viable and will not increase the electricity price in the future, Latvian President Andris Berzins concluded after talks 
with Lithuanian counterpart Dalia Grybauskaite on Thursday. The president believes that Latvia will benefit from 
involvement in this project and his conclusions are based on estimates by Latvia's Latvenergo power utility, Berzins' 
spokeswoman Liga Krapane said.

Local authorities' rights to set property tax rate to be restricted
Local authorities in Latvia will have the right to set the maximum property tax rate of up to 1.5 percent of the 
property's cadastral value. Rates exceeding 1.5 percent of the cadastral value will only be allowed in cases where 
properties are not being maintained in line with legislative regulations. The new rules have been included in draft 
amendments to the property tax law presented on Thursday at a meeting of state secretaries.

The Latvian Constitutional Court is scheduled to hear a lawsuit next week in which several organizations are 
seeking to expand the list of data carriers whose prices include royalties to the authors, performers and producers

Rise in egg prices inevitable
Egg prices are expected to climb at the beginning of April, Latvian egg producers have warned. The main reason 
for the expected price hike is a new EU directive setting forth new mandatory standards for keeping laying hens. 
"Because of the changes in the EU directive on chicken-keeping standards egg prices will slightly rise in Latvia," 
believes Arnis Veinbergs, board chairman of Latvia's leading egg producer Balticovo.

Carriers to fly passengers to 78 destinations from Riga in summer
"Carriers are optimizing their routes and looking, which destinations are more popular and which are less popular. 
The good news is that Airbaltic is resuming flights to Dublin, so passengers will be able to get there not only on 
Ryanair flights," Riga airport CEO Arnis Luhse said, commenting on the airport's plans for this summer. The number 
of destinations to which passengers can fly from Riga has dropped from 85 last year to 78 this summer. The 
reduction has occurred as Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier has been revising its network of destinations.

Number of flights from Riga airport to grow 35 pct during summer season
RIGA, Mar 22, BNS - The number of flights from the Riga international airport will grow 35 percent for the summer 
season, said the airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Rinmane.
"The number of flights has been increased to such destinations as Helsinki, Tallinn, Vilnius, Moscow, Amsterdam, 
Frankfurt and other," she said.
Rinmane also said that in march Estonian airline Estonian Air will resume flights from Riga, flying to and from 
Tallinn 17 times a week, and Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will open flights to Karlsruhe, Germany, three times a 
week.
Norwegian airline will start flights to Swedish capital Stockholm in April and Danish capital Copenhagen in May, she 
said.
The airport's board chairman Arnis Luhse said that the number of travelers to Moscow has risen. "This year and last 
year the number of travelers to Moscow has risen considerably, placing the destination in the second place by 
popularity, thus, the number of flights from Riga to Moscow has been increased to 55 times a week and the flights 
are served by Aeroflot, UTair, Transaero, and [Latvian national carrier] Airbaltic, " said Luhse, adding that the most 
popular destination for passengers from Riga Airport is still London.
He underscored that German airline Lufthansa will fly two times a wekk to Frankfurt, and Airbaltic plans to resume 
flights to one of the most popular destinations, Dublin, Ireland.
The airport reported that flights to Athens, Baku, Nice, Venice, Simferopol will be resumed, and Turkish Airlines will 
launch flights to Antalya.
Number of flights from Riga airport to grow 35 pct during summer season
Uzvbekistan Airways during the summer season will fly to New York twice a week, while Finnair will increase the

New security fee has no impact on number of passengers in Riga airport
RIGA, Mar 14, BNS - The Riga international airport in the Latvian capital this year introduced a new security fee 
payable by passengers but the move has not had any impact on the number of passengers, the airport's 
spokeswoman, Sarmite Rinmane, told BNS.
She said that, despite the introduction of the security fee, the number of passengers was only growing.
"I would like to underline that introduction of the security fee so far has had no impact on the number of passengers 
which keeps growing. In January and February the Riga airport served a total of 603,300 passengers or by 4 
percent more than during the same period last year," Rinmane said.
In January this year the airport had collected nearly 37,000 euros in security fees, she said. The Irish low-cost 
airline Ryanair is the only airline operating out of the Riga airport which has refused to include the new security fee 
in its fares therefore Ryanair passengers have to pay this fee separately either at the airport or through the airport's 
website.
Rinmane said that the airport kept receiving complaints from Ryanair passengers, who did not know why they had 
to pay this fee. "Regretfully, Ryanair still fails to inform its passengers about it," she said.
The Latvian government on October 19, 2011, approved the Transport Ministry's proposal for regulations about the 
fees for  security and rescue services at the  airport  under which passengers at the Riga international airport  will 
be charged a security  fee of 6.5-7 euros, starting from 2012. The security  fee is 6.5 euros, if the passenger pays it 
through the air carrier upon purchase of the airline ticket, and 7 euros, if the passenger pays it before the  security 
 check at the  airport .
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. The Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company. 
In 2011, the Riga  airport  served 5.107 million passengers at a 9.5 percent rise from 2010.

Ryanair confirms intentions to invest in Kaunas with bid to lease land plot for aircraft hangar
VILNIUS, Mar 13, BNS - Ireland 's budget carrier Ryanair has confirmed its intentions to establish an aircraft 
storage and maintenance hangar in Kaunas by placing a bid in an auction for a 50-year lease of a land plot held by 
Kaunas Airport on Tuesday, unofficial sources have confirmed to BNS.
If Ryanair wins the auction, it will lease a land plot for the construction of an aircraft storage and maintenance 
hangar for a 50-year period.
Jonas Gurskas, Development Director at Kaunas Airport, told BNS that the auction had drawn just one bid. 
However, he refused to confirm that it had been submitted by Ryanair.
The bid would be assessed within a fortnight and, if found compliant with the requirements, a contract would be 
signed, Gurskas said.
In line with the terms of the auction the revenues of potential participants on commercial and/or cargo transportation 
by air shall be at least 200 million litas (EUR 57.97 mln) within every last three years, and their own capital shall be 
at least 10 million litas.
Last November the Economy Ministry and Michael Hickey, Director of Engineering at Ryanair, signed a letter of 
intent on Ryanair's investments. As reported then, the air carrier would invest 12 million litas (EUR 3.48 mln) in the 
center. Further 4.143 million litas were planned to be allocated from the European Union's (EU) structural funds. As

Number of destinations from Riga airport might decrease by 20 pct in summer - daily
RIGA, Mar 13, BNS - The number of flight destinations from the international airport of Riga might drop by 20 
percent in the summer, Latvia's Neatkariga Rita Avize (NRA) reported on Tuesday.
The newspaper says that this year the number of destinations is going to decrease from last summer when air 
passengers could fly to 85 destinations from Riga. As airlines are quietly closing their unprofitable routes, the 
number of destinations from Riga is likely to decrease by one fifth in the summer.
Compared to last year, the number of direct connections from Riga has substantially decreased this year, not only 
because Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier is scrapping its unprofitable flights, but also because of rival companies' 
decisions to reduce or terminate their operations from Riga. According to NRA estimates, the number of 
destinations from Riga airport will decrease by one fifth as of March 25, the beginning of the summer season at the 
airport.
A year ago, carriers were serving a total of 85 direct connections from Riga. This year, the figure is going to drop as 
Airbaltic is cutting the number of its destinations from 74 to 60, which is going to also affect the airport's overall 
statistics. Airbaltic flights to Madrid, for instance, have been scrapped for some time already. Although Spanish 
airline Iberia planned to launch flights to Riga in late March, this is not going to happen so soon. There are also 
some positive examples in the airport's flight statistics though: Airbaltic, which stopped flying to Dublin, which is 
home to a large population of Latvians, is resuming these flights from June 1.
Meanwhile, rival airports in the region have not hesitated to strengthen their positions. Tallinn is going to add six 
new destinations to its existing 30 destinations in the summer, and the Lithuanian aviation market is expected to 
revive as well.
Number of destinations from Riga airport might decrease by 20 pct in summer - daily
Estonian Air, which is now headed by Airbaltic's former commercial director Tero Taskila, is planning to launch 17 
flights a week between Riga and Tallinn from the end of March, while Norwegian is planning to launch flight to 
Stockholm from April 19 and to Copenhagen from May 4. Ireland's low-costs carrier Ryanair will be flying 
passengers to Baden-Baden in Germany. Several companies are planning to increase their number of flights from 
Riga. Airbaltic will be flying more frequently to Vienna, Zurich, Munich and Amsterdam, while Lufthansa is 
increasing the number of flights to Frankfurt and Russia's Aeroflot to Moscow.
Riga airport is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. Last year the state-owned Riga International Airport 
served 5.107 million passengers at a 9.5 percent growth from 2010.

Riga Airport still unable to lift seizure of EUR 58 mln worth property in Lithuanian court
(expands)
VILNIUS, Feb 24, BNS - The airport of Riga, which, together with Latvia's air carrier Airbaltic, has been taken to 
court by Lithuania's collapsed FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines, has failed to lift the seizure on 199.83 million litas (EUR 
57.92 mln) worth property.
The Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Feb. 9 that it would decide on this issue later after studying a reply from 
FlyLAL.
The court intends to consider Riga Airport's request on the lifting of property seizure on Feb. 27. In the court's 
opinion, the issue of interim precautionary measures securing FlyLAL's claim is a complicated one, because the 
bankrupt Lithuanian airline has already asked Latvian institutions to enforce Lithuanian courts' decisions on the 
seizure of the assets of Riga Airport and Airbaltic.
The Vilnius Regional Court on Feb. 9 rejected Riga Airport and Airbaltic's request that it decline jurisdiction in favor 
of Latvian courts and ordered Airbaltic to provide information about its performance results and those of its 
Lithuanian branch in 2004 through 2008.
Vilnius Airport and the Lithuanian Civil Aviation Administration are to provide information on all Airbaltic flights to 
and from Vilnius and about the cessation of flights. Vilnius Airport is also to inform the court what discounts it gave 
to carriers during the period in dispute. Riga Airport is to provide data and documents regarding discounts given to 
Airbaltic in 2004 through 2011.
FlyLAL seeks to prove that Riga Airport provided Airbaltic with discounts that were discriminatory against the 
Lithuanian airline.
Riga Airport still unable to lift seizure of EUR 58 mln worth property in Lithuanian court
Latvia's Competition Council ruled in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and favored 
two companies -- Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair. Latvia's corruption watchdog later started a case regarding Riga 
Airport's contracts with air carriers.
FlyLAL in early 2009 suspended its operations due to financial troubles. Shortly afterwards, Airbaltic moved the 
majority of its flights from Vilnius to its hub in Riga.

Kaunas Airport calls one more auction to lease land plot for aircraft hangar
VILNIUS, Feb 22, BNS - Kaunas Airport has announced one more auction for a 50-year lease of a land plot for the 
construction of an aircraft storage and maintenance hangar.
"We seek to find a company offering commercial flights services, which has financial and technical possibilities to 
carry out aircraft storage and maintenance activities," Jonas Gurskas, Development Director at Kaunas Airport, told 
BNS.
He would neither confirm nor deny that the list of auction participants might include Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair, 
which earlier confirmed its intentions to build an aircraft maintenance center in Kaunas.
Last November the Economy Ministry and Michael Hickey, Director of Engineering at Ryanair, signed a letter of 
intent on Ryanair's investments. As reported then, the air carrier would invest 12 million litas (EUR 3.48 mln) in the 
center. Further 4.143 million litas were planned to be allocated from the European Union's (EU) structural funds.
In line with the terms of the auction, which would be held on Mar. 13, the revenues of potential participants on 
commercial and/or cargo transportation by air shall be at least 200 million litas within every last three years, and 
their own capital shall be at least 10 million litas.
The hangar has to be of appropriate size to accommodate at least one Boeing 737 type aircraft or other type/model 
aircrafts of no less size. Moreover, the construction of the hangar shall be finished within twelve months.

Bankruptcy of Latvijas Karjbanka announced
The Latvian financial watchdog, the Finance and Capital Markets Commission (FKTK) on Tuesday decided to file 
for the bankruptcy of Latvijas Krajbanka (Latvian Savings Bank), which was declared insolvent two months ago. 
According to reports by the bank's insolvency administrator KPMG Baltics the bank's maintenance costs about one 
million lats (EUR 1.4 mln) a month. This means that nearly four million lats have already been lost since the bank 
was shut down in November 2011.

Airport fined for tariffs
The international airport of Riga considers paying the fine imposed by the Latvian Competition Council for abuse of 
dominant position because the airport had been charging significantly lower airport fees from Ireland's low-costs 
carrier Ryanair than from Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier. The competition watchdog has therefore imposed a 
50,000 lats fine on the airport. The case was launched after Airbaltic lodged a complaint over the unequal fees.

Rise in producer prices slowing down
Global developments have been curbing the rise in Latvian producer prices. A drop in consumption in Western 
Europe and declining commodity prices are gradually slowing down inflation in Latvia. In January 2012, Latvian 
producer prices grew 7.1 percent from January 2011, the national statistics office reported. The producer prices for 
goods sold on the domestic market in January 2012 rose 9.4 percent year-on-year while the producer prices for 
export goods grew 4.1 percent.

Port reformers ready for battle
Due to economic and political reasons, the changes planned in Latvian ports may prove insignificant. The ruling 
centrist Zatlers Reform Party (ZRP) has expressed a strong resolve to amend laws and change the long-standing 
port management traditions, but it may be hard to secure real political support for significant reforms. Political 
interests in Latvian ports and the desire to preserve the status quo are still strong. "It is clear to us that change is 
necessary, because the competitiveness of the Latvian ports has weakened," said Vjaceslavs Dombrovskis, an MP 
of ZRP who chairs the parliament economic, agriculture, environment and regional policy committee.

Valsts Mezi offer alternative
The Latvian Agriculture Ministry has ordered Latvijas Valsts Mezi (Latvian State Forests), the manager of state-
owned forests, to substantially increase the offer to forest owners that want to sell their property. This is also one of 
the measures included by the ministry in the support program for the eastern Latvian region of Latgale, said 
Edvards Smiltens, the ministry's parliamentary secretary.

Latvian competition watchdog imposes EUR 70,000 fine on Riga airport for breaking EU competition law
RIGA, Feb 21, BNS - The Latvian competition watchdog, the Competition Council, has imposed a 50,000 lats (EUR 
71,150) fine on the Riga international airport for breaking the EU competition law, the competition watchdog said.
Competition Council's spokeswoman Inita Kabanova told BNS that the competition watchdog had found that the 
Riga airport had violated the ban on abuse of dominant position by charging from the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair 
much lower fees for airport services than the fees paid by the Latvian national airline Airbaltic.
A 50,000 lats fine has been imposed on the Riga airport along with legal obligations to charge reasonable and non-
discriminatory fees for its services, supplying airlines with easy-to-understand information about the pricing of each 
of the services provided by the airport.
"Upon comparing the charges to both airlines, the Competition Council concluded that Airbaltic had been paying 82 
percent more than Ryanair for same services. In addition, Airbaltic also had to pay for the airport's administrative 
costs which were not charged from Ryanair," Kabanova said.
The airline's application of discriminatory fees has had significant adverse effects on Airbaltic competitiveness 
compared to Ryanair, the competition watchdog said.
Discriminatory fees were applied from November 1, 2009, till December 31, 2010, when, in line with the EU 
directive, an independent company, North Hub Services, started providing the services in question at the Riga 
airport, supplying them to Airbaltic.
Kabanova said that the Riga airport had used different methodologies for calculating the fees for the two airlines - 
the fees payable by Airbaltic were based on the number of aircraft served while the fees for Ryanair were based on 
Latvian competition watchdog imposes EUR 70,000 fine on Riga airport for breaking EU competition law
the number of passengers carried. While use of different methodologies is allowed, this ought not to result in 
discriminatory payments, she added.
The Competition Council also said that in general Airbaltic was bringing to the Riga airport larger revenues than 
Ryanair.
The competition watchdog started looking into the fees charged by the Riga airport at the request by Airbaltic.

"The start of the year is encouraging. We hope that the unstable economic situation in Europe will not thwart Vilnius

launching operations the airport this year," Lithuanian Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis said in a press release.
The airport last year posted a 25 percent increase in annual passenger traffic to 1.7 million.
Seventeen carriers currently operate regular flights to and from the Lithuanian capital, including Lufthansa, Finnair,

Kaunas airport seeks builder for MRO hangar
VILNIUS, Feb 03, BNS - Kaunas Airport has announced another auction for a 40-year lease of a land plot for the 
construction of an aircraft technical maintenance hangar.
Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas told BNS that there is demand in the market and that around 20 million litas 
(EUR 5.8 mln) should be invested in building and equipping the hangar.
The CEO said that the new MRO hangar should have the capacity to accommodate at least two Boeing 757 jets or 
other aircraft of similar size.
"We see demand in the market and have to react and meet it. We are glad to see that technical maintenance 
operations in Lithuania are developing and that the work we started several years ago is yielding results," he said.
Sliupas declined to name the companies interested in the project. "These are companies from EU countries," he 
only said.
If Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair finally approves its plans to build an aircraft maintenance hangar, this will be a 
third MRO hangar at the airport, Sliupas said.
Aviabaltika, a company owned by Yuri Borisov, has won an earlier land lease auction and plans to invest 3 million 
litas in building a helicopter repair and maintenance hangar at Kaunas Airport.
The new land lease auction is scheduled for Mar. 1.

London, Moscow, Helsinki most popular destinations for outbound passengers from Riga airport in 2011
RIGA, Jan 19, BNS - London, Moscow, and Helsinki were the most popular destinations for outbound passengers 
from Riga airport in 2011, said the airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Bunka-Brillijonka.
The top-five most popular destinations also included Oslo and Stockholm last year.
The airport representative said that last year 66 percent of all airport's passengers were served by Latvian national 
carrier Airbaltic, 20 percent were served by Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. As compared to 2010 the number of 
passengers carried by Hungarian low-cost airlineWizz Air rose by 62 percent, the number of passengers served by 
Finnish Finnair increased by 40 percent, and the number of passengers carried by Russian Aeroflot rose by 34 
percent.
Last year 37 percent of all passengers served at the airport were transit passengers, and the most popular transit 
destinations were Vilnius, Tallinn, Helsinki, Moscow and Berlin.
"The Riga airport still has more outbound passengers than inbound passengers. Last year the different was 21,000 
people," said the airport's board chairman Arnis Luhse. The airport served 2,563,970 outbound passengers and 
2,542,956 inbound passengers.
Luhse said that the airport is still working on developing the route network to be able to offer various and easily 
accessible destinations for leisure and business trips. He said that this year the airport hopes to serve the same 
number of passengers as last year.
This year new airlines plan to start flying from the airport, Ryanair plans to launch flights to Karlsruhe in Germany, 
Airbaltic plans to increase the number of flights to Vienna, Zurich, Munich, Amsterdam, Lufthansa plans to increase 
the number of flights to Frankfurt, and Aeroflot will increase the number of flights to Moscow.
London, Moscow, Helsinki most popular destinations for outbound passengers from Riga airport in 2011
"Serving five million passengers a year, we officially rank among medium-size airports, and internationally are 
valued higher than the small airports," said Luhse.
In 2011, passenger turnover at the international airport of Riga rose by 9.5 percent from a year ago to 5.107 million 
people, said Bunka-Brilijonka. In 2011, Riga airport  handled 72,855 flights at a 7 percent rise from 2010. Cargo

Riga airport plans to collect over EUR 7 mln in security fees in 2012
RIGA, Jan 16, BNS - The international airport of Riga is planning to collect 5.077 million lats (EUR 7.22 mln) in the 
recently introduced security fees this year, the airport's board member Aldis Murnieks told BNS.
"There are several security measures the airport needs to take. Until now, the process was subsidized by the 
government, but these subsidies have been significantly reduced in recent years. In total, we hope to collect 5.077 
million lats this year, which would be as much as we were allocated by the government in 2008. There are several 
inconsistencies in our security system, so we need to take measures to deal with them. We need to invest, for 
instance, in X-ray and scanning equipment, as well upgrade the firefighters' transportation fleet. We also need 
money for staff training and wages," the representative of Riga airport explained.
He added though that the turnover of passengers is changeable and there are no guarantees that the planned 
security fees will be collected. "Still, we have to make the investments. When these investments are made and the 
inconsistencies eliminated, the size of the security fee might be reduced. But I think that this is not going to happen 
in the next couple of years. Under the government regulations, the size of the fee must be revised if the number of 
passengers increases or drops by 15 percent a year," the representative said.
The airport has been collecting the security fee from air passengers for two weeks already and it is clear that the 
system is working, Murnieks said. "It is clear that the system is working. The first week has been quiet though, 
because most passengers had bought their air tickets last year when the security fee was not yet included in the 
price," Murnieks explained.
The airport expects the collection of the security fee to increase over time. "It will become a regular process in a 
month, because month is the average time for planning short-term trips. The income from the security fee will 
increase then. But we already see that the system is working and that Ryanair passengers who have not paid the 
fee as they bought their tickets are buying the coupons at the airport without any problems," said Murnieks.
Riga airport plans to collect over EUR 7 mln in security fees in 2012
The representative of the airport voiced hopes that Irish low-costs airline Ryanair might revise its decision in the 
future and agree to include the fee in its ticket prices. "We hope that we will succeed in holding more constructive 
talks with the carrier in the future," Murnieks said, admitting though that there are no signs of this for the time being.
The Latvian government on October 19 this year approved the Transport Ministry's proposal for regulations about 
the fees for security and rescue services at the airport under which passengers at the Riga international  airport  will 
be charged a   security   fee of 6.5-7 euros, starting from next year.
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. The Riga International Airport  is a fully state-owned company. 
In 2010, the Riga airport served 4.664 million passengers at a 14.7 percent rise from the year before.

VILNIUS, Jan 05, BNS - An aircraft maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) unit of Ireland's budget carrier 
Ryanair at Kaunas Airport should launch operations by the end of this year, the airport's CEO, Arijandas Sliupas, 
said on Thursday.
"Eighteen people are now receiving training, which they should complete their training by the end of February. Then 
they will be sent to three-month practical courses to the Prestwick base, where they will develop their technical and 
practical skills. Those people are being retrained. They were doing car, engine repairs, which is the same 
mechanics. (The MRO unit) should be operating at the end of the year," he told BNS.
The Lithuanian Economy Ministry and Michael Hickey, the director of engineering at Ryanair, last November signed 
a letter of intent on the airline's investment. It was announced that the company was planning to invest 12 million 
litas (EUR 3.5 mln) in the MRO unit, with another 4.143 million litas to come from the EU's funds.
Hickey then said that Kaunas Airport was more attractive than many other airports in Europe in terms of business 
expansion.
The airline planned to employ a total of 60 people at the Kaunas MRO center.
Ryanair has MRO units in the United Kingdom and Germany. The airline currently operates flights from Vilnius and 
Kaunas airports.

Passenger traffic through Vilnius airport grows by one-fourth in 2011
VILNIUS, Jan 04, BNS - Vilnius International Airport, the largest airport in Lithuania, handled 1.7 million passengers 
last year, up 25 percent from 2010.
In December alone, passenger traffic soared by 66.3 percent, year-on-year, to 135,000, the airport said.
Tomas Vaisvila, the airport's CEO, has recently said that solid performance, including the development of routes 
and record number of passengers, was driven by low-cost policy and new pricing system.
This year the passenger flow was expected to increase by 25 percent and the number of flights was to grow by 5 
percent, he said.
In 2012-2013 the airport would seek to reduce the costs further and to increase the revenues on aviation and other 
activities while applying the pricing attractive for carriers and using a larger flow of passengers.
Seventeen carriers currently operate regular flights to and from the Lithuanian capital, including Lufthansa, Finnair, 
Aer Lingus, SAS, Brussels Airlines, Airbaltic, Ryanair and Wizz Air.

Tightened belt will not be released
The mission of the international donors in Latvia has ended with saving 2.3 billion lats (EUR 3.27 b) and a number 
of lessons. Latvia has completed the three-year international financial aid program during which it had to implement 
tough austerity measures to stabilize its finances after the steep economic decline. The last documents marking 
completion of the program were signed with the donors - the European Union and the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) before Christmas. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said that the lessons learned from the crisis 
included the following - budget consolidation is an effective anti-crisis remedy, devaluation is not inevitable, and 
cutting costs is a better method than raising taxes.

Passengers to pay for airport security themselves
Passengers of the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair departing from the Riga airport in the Latvian capital will have to pay 
a security fee of 7 euros at the airport, starting with January 1, 2012. For passengers travelling by other airlines the 
security fee will be 6.5 euros, payable upon purchase of the ticket. It is planned that in February Ryanair 
passengers would also be able to pay the security fee online. The Latvian Consumer Rights Protection Center 
believes that Ryanair's refusal to add the security fee to the air fare upon purchase of the ticket amounts to a 
violation.

defendants has requested psychiatric tests. All in all, nine attempts to rob various bank branches in Riga took place

Riga airport plans to collect newly-introduced security fee from 1.5 mln passengers in 2012
(expands)
RIGA, Dec 29, BNS - Next year the Riga international airport in the Latvian capital will introduce a security fee to be 
paid by passengers and plans to collect the security fee from some 1.5 million passengers in 2012.
The airport's board Member Aldis Murnieks told this to the press, underlining that these were general estimates.
The estimates are based on the projection that in 2012 the Riga airport will serve a total of five million passengers, 
of which half or 2.5 million will be outbound passengers. Security fees will be collected from some 1.5 million 
passengers because transit and transfer passengers, children under two years of age and passengers, who have 
bought their tickets before December 31, 2011, will be exempt from the payment of the   security   fee, Murnieks 
explained.
He said that nearly all airlines operating out of the Riga airport had agreed to include the security fee of 6.5 euros in 
their ticket prices, with exception of the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. Therefore Ryanair passengers will be paying 
the fee at the airport either upon check-in at the Ryanair ticket counters in the airport or in the airport services office. 
For them the security fee will be 7 euros due to extra costs involved in collecting the fee directly from passengers, 
the airport's representative explained, adding that in future more payment options will be considered to make the 
process easier for Ryanair passengers.
The airport's PR Department head, Sarmite Bunka-Brilijonka, said that it was planned to collect the higher security 
fee of 7 euros from some 411,800 Ryanair passengers next year.
Riga airport plans to collect newly-introduced security fee from 1.5 mln passengers in 2012
The  security  fee will cover the  security  checks of passengers, checked and cabin baggage at the  airport , the 
 airport 's  security  and crisis management services, including rescue operations, and the measures for flight safety 
and civil aviation safety supervision carried out by the Civil Aviation Agency (CAA).
The security fee will be introduced due to reduction of the state subsidies to the airport.
The Latvian government on October 19 this year approved the Transport Ministry's proposal for regulations about 
the fees for  security  and rescue services at the airport  under which passengers at the Riga international  airport 
 will be charged a  security  fee of 6.5-7 euros, starting from next year.
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. The Riga International Airport  is a fully state-owned company. 
In 2010, the Riga airport served 4.664 million passengers at a 14.7 percent rise from the year before.

Vilnius Airport expects passenger flow to grow by one-fourth in 2012
VILNIUS, Dec 29, BNS - Vilnius International Airport, the largest airport in Lithuania, expects the passenger flow to 
grow by some 25 percent next year versus 2011 and the number of flights to increase by 5 percent.
"It seems that we have chosen the right direction - two large budget carriers, including WizzAir and Ryanair, started 
operations in the Vilnius airport in spring, Sweden's Skyways returned to the airport in summer and early in winter 
the existing companies were joined by the second-largest Russia's air carrier Transaero. Considering the launch of 
flights by these companies and the opening of new direct routes we may expect the passenger flow to increase by 
24 percent next year. We plan the number of passengers and flights to increase by 25 percent and 5 percent, 
respectively, in 2012, and by further 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in 2013," Tomas Vaisvila, the airport's 
CEO, said in a press release.
Seventeen carriers currently operate regular flights to and from the Lithuanian capital - the most compared with 
other airports in the Baltic countries. Regular flights are offered to 26 airports and 23 destinations. In 2012 seven 
new routes are expected to be opened.

Vilnius airport aims to get back in black in 2012 - CEO
VILNIUS, Dec 29, BNS - Vilnius International Airport, the largest airport in Lithuania, aims to break even or return to 
profit next year, Tomas Vaisvila, the airport's CEO, said.
"We had projected a loss of over 5 million litas (EUR 1.45 mln) for this year. We managed to save on all (budget) 
items and our result will be a loss of about 1 million litas. Next year we will do our best not to operate at a loss. That 
depends greatly on the economic situation in Lithuania -- both on how often Lithuanian residents and foreigners will 
travel by air and on how active businesses will be," he told Lithuanian radio.
Vilnius Airport posted a net loss of 1.042 million litas for the nine months through September, down from 3.17 
million litas in the same period last year. The airport last year managed to cut its annual loss by half, to 8.614 million 
litas from 17.010 million litas in 2009.
Airports Council International (ACI Europe) has said recently that Vilnius Airport ranked first among 170 European 
airports covered in the report in terms of passenger traffic growth in October.
Vilnius Airport handled 1.577 million passengers in January through November, a rise of 22 percent compared with 
a year ago.
Eighteen carriers currently operate regular flights to and from the Lithuanian capital, including Lufthansa, Finnair, 
Aer Lingus, SAS, Brussels Airlines, Airbaltic, Ryanair and Wizz Air.

Tallinn is fastest growing airport in Europe - paper
TALLINN, Dec 22, BNS - The Tallinn airport expects to serve 1.9 million passengers this year which surpasses the 
best-ever result recorded in 2008 and also makes it the fastest-growing airport in the Baltic region and whole 
Europe, the daily Postimees says. 
Between January and November this year passenger traffic has increased by 38.1 percent at the Tallinn airport, 9.9 
percent at the Riga airport, 8.7 percent at the Kaunas airport and 22 percent at the Vilnius airport.
The chief executive of the airport, Rein Loik, attributes the vigorous growth mostly but not solely to the arrival of the 
low-cost carrier Ryanair. "Other airlines too and the whole Estonian economy have contributed to our extraordinarily 
successful year," he said.
Loik added that the national carrier, Estonian Air, also has been doing well in recent months which has resulted in 
the announcement of the European airports' association that Tallinn is the fastest-developing airport in its category.

and leisure. We continue to look at Germany, even though we will have five direct flights to German cities in 2012. 
Southern Europe and Turkey are very interesting to us. We are actively working with Israel, as we see that charter 
flights from Israel to Lithuania in the summer bring a considerable number of people from Israel to Druskininkai,"

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair to continue flights from Riga at least till 2015 - airport CEO
RIGA, Dec 09, BNS - The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will continue operating out of the Riga airport in the Latvian 
capital regardless of the company's decision to reduce the number of routes and flights from Riga next year, Arnis 
Luhse, the board chairman of the Riga International Airport, said on the morning news program of the LNT 
commercial television on Friday.
Ryanair will probably keep making flights to and from Riga at least till 2015 when their agreement with the Riga 
airport will expire. "As long as it will be profitable for them to fly here, they will continue flying," Luhse said.
He said that Ryanair had wanted the airport to exempt the airline from the security fee that will be introduced at the 
beginning of next year.
Closing of certain Ryanair routes from Riga announced by the Irish airline following the news about introduction of 
the security may result in some other airlines raising their fares, the airport CEO said.
,,But it cannot be said for sure because some airlines have already said that they would not raise their fares. Out of 
17 airlines, 16 have said that the security fees are acceptable. Of course, each individual airline is dealing with it in 
its own way - some add [the security fee] to the fare, others pay [the fee] themselves," Luhse said.
The Ryanair decision to reduce the number of flights out of Riga will not affect the airport's operations or cause a 
decline in the number of passengers, he said. Moreover, talks are constantly under way to bring new airlines to the 
Riga airport.
Ryanair   will next year stop flying from Riga to Bristol (UK), Bremen (Germany) and Tampere (Finland) and also 
reduce the number of flights out of Riga  o n some other routes. T he decision has been made due to the plan by 
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair to continue flights from Riga at least till 2015 - airport CEO
the Riga airport to introduce a fee for security and rescue services in the amount of 6.5-7 euros to be paid by 
passengers, starting with January 1, 2012.

types will not develop that fast, and their share by 2030 will grow from 5 percent to some 17 percent," said Latvia 
Statoil executive director Ilze Silina.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair to stop flying from Riga to Brussels, Bremen, Tampere in 2012
(expands)
RIGA, Nov 30, BNS - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will next year stop flying from Riga to Brussels, Bremen and 
Tampere, the airline's Baltic Sales and   Marketing   Executive, Elina Hakkarainen, told the press on Wednesday.
She said that Ryanair would cease flights from Riga to Bremen and Brussels at the beginning of next year. Also, 
Ryanair had planned to resume flights to Tampere in April 2012 but now a decision has been made not to do it.
Ryanair has also decided to reduce the number of flights out of Riga at the beginning of 2012. The weekly number 
of Ryanair flights from Riga will be reduced by 42 flights next year.
Hakkarainen said that the decision was due to plan by the Riga airport to introduce a fee for security and rescue 
services in the amount of 6.5-7 euros to be paid by passengers, starting with January 1, 2012.
At present Ryanair is flying to 16 destinations from Riga.

Riga airport serves 60 pct of all air passengers in Baltics this year
RIGA, Nov 16, BNS - The Riga international airport in the Latvian capital so far this year has served 4.4 million 
travelers or 60 percent of all air passengers served by the airports in the Baltic states, the Riga airport said.
Sarmite Bunka-Brilijonka, a spokeswoman for the Riga airport, told BNS that the Tallinn airport in Estonia had 
served 1.6 million passengers this year and the Vilnius airport in Lithuania had served 1.4 million passengers.
This year the largest number of passengers used the Riga airport to travel to or from Germany - 506,320, while 
492,417 passengers traveled to or from the United Kingdom and 415,579 passengers traveled to or from Finland. 
The most frequently used airlines were the Latvian national airline Airbaltic as well as the low-cost airlines Ryanair 
and WizzAir.
Arnis Luhse, the board chairman of the Riga International Airport, said that flights to two new destinations -- Leeds 
in the United Kingdom and Eindhoven in the Netherlands - had been launched from Riga during the winter season, 
bringing the total number of destinations to 88.
Out of a total of 4.4 million passengers served by the Riga airport so far this year, 1.6 million were transfer/transit 
passengers, who mostly travelled by Airbaltic, Uzbekistan Airways and Aeroflot. The most popular destinations 
among transfer/transit passengers were Vilnius, Tallinn, Helsinki, Moscow and Barcelona.
The Riga airport served 4,433,940 passengers during the first ten months of 2011, which is a 10.4 percent rise from 
the same period in 2010. The number of passengers served during the full year of 2010 reached 4.664 million, up 
14.7 percent from 2009. 
The Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company. The Riga airport is the largest air traffic hub in the 
Baltics.

Ireland's Ryanair to invest EUR 3.5 mln in aircraft maintenance center in Kaunas
VILNIUS, Nov 11, BNS - Ireland 's budget carrier Ryanair intends to invest 12 million litas (EUR 3.5 mln) in an 
aircraft maintenance center planned to be set up in Kaunas airport.
Further 4.143 million litas are planned to be allocated from the European Union's (EU) structural funds, in line with 
the letter of intent signed by Economy Minister Rimantas Zylius and Michael Hickey, Director of Engineering at 
Ryanair, the Economy Ministry reported on Friday.
"The aircraft maintenance center, which is being started to be formed close to Kaunas, is a good piece of news for 
the city and the whole country. The air carrier's decision to invest in our country was based on several years of 
experience acquired here, the assessment of investment and business environment, labor skills. This investment in 
the aircraft service center and training of skilled workers shows Ryanair's intentions to stay in Lithuania for long", 
Zylius said in a press release.
Ryanair's center is said to employ a workforce of 60.
The air carrier intends to build a 3,500 square meters maintenance hangar, which will service the company's 
aircraft. Actual maintenance works are expected to be launched in the fall of 2012.
According to Hickey, the airport of Kaunas is more attractive than many other European airports as regards 
expansion possibilities.
Ryanair operates aircraft maintenance centers in the UK and Germany.
The air carrier currently offers flights from the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas.

Lithuanian airports will handle fewer flights during winter season - daily
VILNIUS, Nov 02, BNS - The number of flights to and from Lithuanian airports will decline in the just started winter 
season yet the decline is less significant than in previous years, the Lietuvos Rytas daily reports on Wednesday.
The changes are the biggest at the Airport of Kaunas as Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair has decided to stop flights 
from the second largest Lithuania's city to the Greek islands of Kos and Rhodes, as well as to Alicante in Spain until 
late March next year. However, the company has added flights to Leeds (UK) and Eindhoven (the Netherlands) to 
its winter schedule.
"We want to believe that there will be more of good changes in winter, however, the air carriers reserve most news 
for the summer season," the daily quoted Kaunas Airport CEO, Arijandas Sliupas, as saying.
He said to be negotiating flights with the Scandinavian, Russian and German companies.
Meanwhile, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) launched flights to the airport of Palanga.
Latvia 's Airbaltic reduced the number of weekly flights to Palanga to four, from seven, same as the number of 
weekly flights from Kaunas to Riga. The number of daily flights from Vilnius was cut to five, from seven.
Moreover, Airbaltic stopped flights from Vilnius to Tallinn leaving Estonian Air the only carrier on this route.

Ryanair to reduce number of flights out of Riga upon introduction of security fee - LTV
RIGA, Oct 21, BNS - The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair plans to reduce the number of flights it is making from the 
Riga international airport in the Latvian capital when the airport introduces security fees next year, the public 
Latvian Television (LTV) reported on Thursday evening.
A Ryanair spokesman told the LTV that the airline had reduced the number of flights in other countries that had 
introduced similar fees and the number of passengers decreased in those airports.
He said that this was going to happen also to the Riga airport.
When the new tax is introduced, we will definitely reduce the number of flights in the Riga airport and it would be a 
step back in development of tourism and the airport, the Ryanair representative said.
The Latvian government on October 19 approved the Transport Ministry proposal for regulations about the fees for 
security and rescue services at the airport under which passengers at the Riga international airport will be charged 
a security fee of 6.5-7 euros.
At present Ryanair is flying to 15 destinations from Riga.
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. The Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company. 
In 2010, the Riga airport served 4.664 million passengers at a 14.7 percent rise from the year before.

Competition in Baltic region's aviation sector set to increase - Estonian Air head
RIGA, Sep 26, BNS - Competition in the Baltic region's aviation sector will only increase in the future, Tero Taskila, 
the former commercial director of Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier and the current president of Estonian Air, said in 
an interview published on Monday in Latvia's Diena daily.
"Both Estonian Air and Airbaltic, just like any other airline in this region, are trying to improve their route networks 
within one and the same market -- we all fly to Scandinavia and countries of the former Soviet Union, so everything 
depends on which one of us is more efficient and reliable. The aviation sector here is facing big change, as Finnair 
has already announced that it is planning much more aggressive operations in the Bakltics. SAS is developing a 
new strategy for the Baltic states. There is also a new carrier, Flybe Nordic, which is set to launch up to 40 planes in 
the Baltic direction. Supply from low-cost carriers Wizz Air and Ryanair is growing as well. So this is going to be a 
region with tough competition," said Taskila.
In his words, the success story of Latvia's aviation business is based on its dense direct flights network, which 
Estonian Air should build as well. "Furthermore, the Baltic states need their own national airlines very much. They 
cannot rely on foreign carriers that have their own interests and hubs," the Estonian Air president said.
The Estonian state holds 90 percent of Estonian Air shares, while Scandinavia's SAS owns a 10 percent stake.

Vilnius Airport set to plow some EUR 28 mln in expansion by 2015
VILNIUS, Sept 21, BNS - Vilnius International Airport, the largest airport in Lithuania, intends to plow some 100 
million litas (EUR 28.98 mln) in expansion by 2015. Moreover, the airport aims to work out a master plan by the end 
of next year.
This year the airport will complete the 35 million litas worth (VAT included) reconstruction of apron cover, Sandra 
Siauliene, the airport's spokeswoman, told BNS.
By 2012 the airport intends to expand its northern apron through a project worth some 49 million litas (ex VAT).
Other major projects would include the acquisition of registered luggage check system for 12 million litas and the 15 
million litas worth extension of runway in 2013-2014.
The airport handled 1.091 million passengers in January-August, up 13.4 percent, year-on-year. Its net losses 
shrank by 23 percent, to 3 million litas, in the first half of this year, from 3.872 million litas, in the same period last 
year, whereas the revenues contracted by 24 percent, to 15.057 million litas.
Seventeen carriers currently operate regular flights to and from the Lithuanian capital, including Lufthansa, Finnair, 
Aer Lingus, SAS, Brussels Airlines, Airbaltic, Ryanair and Wizz Air.
The airport is fully owned by the state.

Latvian president, formin stranded in Brussels because of cancelled Airbaltic flight
(updates, adds paras. 6-9)
RIGA, Sep 13, BNS - Because of a number of flights cancelled by the Latvian national airline Airbaltic, Latvian 
President Andris Berzins, who planned to return to Latvia from Brussels on Tuesday evening, and Latvian Foreign 
Minister Girts Valdis Kristovskis, who was to leave for Riga on Monday evening, were unable to travel home in line 
with their original plans.
"The President has also become a hostage to the policies by [Airbaltic CEO Bertolt] Flick," the president's 
spokeswoman, Liga Krapane, told BNS.
She said that Airbaltic had already canceled the Brussels-Riga flight on Monday evening and will not be flying from 
Brussels to Riga also on Tuesday evening therefore the presidential staff were looking for other options to bring 
Berzins back to Latvia on Tuesday evening.
But tickets to other flights are being sold out fast, and it might be problematic for the Latvian president to return 
home on Tuesday evening.
Berzins was accompanied on the visit to Brussels by Krapane, Gundars Daudze, who is the head of the president's 
office, and Andris Pelss, the presidential advisor on foreign affairs.
The public Latvian Radio reported at noon on Tuesday that the Latvian president would on Tuesday fly home via 
Hamburg. He will take a Lufthansa flight to Hamburg where he would have to wait for a while for the Airbaltic flight 
that would bring him to Riga around midnight.
Latvian president, formin stranded in Brussels because of cancelled Airbaltic flight
As the Latvian president already had a full schedule for Wednesday, the presidential staff was frantically looking for 
the options to bring him to Latvia on Tuesday evening as planned, considering even a possibility to take the Irish 
low-cost airline Ryanair.
Commenting on the situation with the cancelled Airbaltic flights, the Latvian president said that the decision 
regarding the national airline had been delayed for too long, which was unforgivable, and the pre-election mood 
also had been one of the factors. Moreover, so far the airline still has failed to give any reason for the flight 
cancellation.
The Latvian Radio said that the cancelled Airbaltic flights had caused great inconvenience also to other 
passengers, especially since those flights usually are taken by people travelling for business purposes.
Latvian Foreign Minister Girts Valdis Kristovskis, who had planned to return to Riga on Monday evening, also had to 
remain in Brussels because his flight was canceled, the minister's spokeswoman, Dace Balode, told BNS. Luckily, 
the foreign minister managed to get a seat on a mid-day flight on Tuesday.
Airbaltic has cancelled flights to and from Brussels, Berlin, Stockholm, Tallinn and Vilnius on Tuesday. On Monday 
the airline already cancelled flights to and from Brussels, Berlin, Tallinn and Vilnius. Airbaltic spokesman Janis 
Vanags earlier told BNS that there were several daily Airbaltic flights to all those destinations and none of the flights 
cancelled was the only flight of the day.
The Latvian Transport Ministry on Monday called on the Airbaltic management board to immediately supply 
explanations about the reasons for flight cancellation and to ensure that the flights planned on Tuesday were 
carried out.
"The state as the largest shareholder underlines that it is the responsibility of the Airbaltic management board to 
ensure daily operations of the airline as a passenger carrier. The company's management board has failed to 
provide any information about the reasons for cancelling the flights to Brussels, Berlin, Vilnius and Tallinn either to 
the company's customers or the shareholders," Transport Ministry spokesman Aivis Freidenfelds said.
He said that such actions by the Airbaltic management board could qualify as intentional sabotage, as they 
undermined the company's reputation, caused financial losses and reduced the company's value.
Airbaltic has posted 34.2 million lats (EUR 48.66 mln) in an unaudited 2010 loss in contrast to profit in 2009.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from all three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares, and Baltijas 
Aviacijas Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent. A 50 percent stake in BAS belongs to 
Airbaltic CEO Bertolt Flick, and another 50 stake is held by Taurus Asset Management Fund Limited, a company 
registered in the Bahamas.

Group of Latvian children stranded in airport in London
RIGA, Aug 25, BNS - A group of some 20 children from Latvia missed their airplane to Riga on Wednesday evening 
and have been stranded in the airport in London, the LNT commercial television reported on Thursday.
"They missed the airplane because security control of their belongings took a long time. Unfortunately, there were 
prohibited items, namely, liquids, in their hand luggage. While the luggage of the entire large group was being 
checked, the Ryanair airplane left for Riga," Latvian Foreign Ministry representative Janis Silis said.
Only two of the 20 children made it to the airplane on time. The rest of the children spent the night in London 
Stansted airport.
The children are from poor families and families with many children. They had went on a trip to France arranged by 
the Solla association and financed from donations. As the children had missed their flight, they were told that they 
would have to buy tickets to another flight but neither the association nor most of the parents have the money to 
pay the fares.
The Latvian embassy in London is trying to solve the situation but the embassy can't pay the air fares for the 
children. The embassy has sent a letter to Ryanair, asking the Irish low-cost airline to help bring the children back to 
Latvia but the airline said it would do it only if some 100 pounds sterling per child are paid.
"Regretfully, neither the children nor the adults accompanying them, nor the embassy, nor the state have the 
money," Silis said.
The woman in charge of the group of children, who is together with them at the airport, said that so far only one 
local government in Latvia had said that it was willing to help.

Seven children might return home on Thursday evening but it is not clear what would happen to the remaining 
eleven children.
Latvians living in London have also responded to the news about the children's plight and are trying to contact the 
group to offer them a place to spend the night.

ForMin to repeatedly propose setting up fund to provide support to Latvians who run into trouble abroad
RIGA, Aug 25, BNS - Latvian Foreign Minister Girts Valdis Kristovskis is set to repeatedly propose to the 
government the ministry's idea to create the Financial Assistance Fund, BNS was told at the ministry's press 
service.
The fund would be created to help the Latvian state to provide support to Latvian citizens that have run into trouble 
in foreign countries. The Cabinet of Ministers might consider the proposal on September 6.
"If such an assistance fund had been created earlier, assistance to the group of Latvian children that got stuck in 
London on August 23 and 24 could be provided faster and more effectively," Kristovskis said.
A group of some 20 children from Latvia missed their airplane to Riga on Wednesday evening and have been 
stranded in the airport in London, the LNT commercial television reported on Thursday.
Only two of the 20 children made it to the airplane on time. The rest of the children spent the night in London

embassy sent a letter to Ryanair, asking the Irish low-cost airline to help bring the children back to Latvia but the 
airline said it would do it only if some 100 pounds sterling per child are paid. Ultimately, an agreement was reached 
with Ryanair on a substantial discounts for the tickets, so that the children could be flown home. Solla sought

assistance from local authorities in Latvia, with several of them responding to the appeal to help buy air tickets for 
the stranded children to flights scheduled on August 24 and 25.
Latvians living in London have also responded to the news about the children's plight and are trying to contact the 
group to offer them a place to spend the night.
The Foreign Ministry said that about 50,000 lats (EUR 71,100) would be needed to set up the Financial Assistance 
Fund.

Ryanair flight from Brussels to Riga suffers technical problems, lands with delay
RIGA, Aug 22, BNS - The airplane of the Irish low-cost airline Ryainair flying from Brussels to Riga on Monday had 
suffered technical problems, Latvian Civil Aviation Director General Maris Gorodcovs told BNS.
He said that the plane had had problems with the landing gear. After contacting the Latvian state-owned air traffic 
controller Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (LGS), the airplane had flown over the Riga airport so that the experts could 
make visual inspection.
When the experts confirmed that the landing gear had been fully deployed, the airplane landed successfully, 
Gorodcovs said.
Sarmite Bunka-Brilijonka, the spokeswoman of the Riga airport, confirmed that the airplane had had technical 
problems and had landed with a delay. It was scheduled to arrive at 10.15 a.m., but had landed only at 12.38 p.m., 
she said.
Ryanair is flying to 15 destinations from Riga.

BAS ready to buy state-held shares in Latvia's Airbaltic carrier
(expands)
RIGA, Aug 17, BNS - Baltijas Aviacijas Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), the private shareholder of Latvia's 
Airbaltic national carrier, has voiced readiness to acquire all state-held shares in the airline, BAS board member 
Inga Piterniece told BNS.
In her words, this is one of the proposals BAS is set to urgently submit to Latvian Prime Minister 
Valdis Dombrovskis.
To resolve the situation with Airbaltic, BAS would also be ready to sell its investments in the airline's capital, 
recovering at the same time all loans made by the private shareholder, as well as selling back to the Latvian state 
the Airbaltic brand. A third proposal calls for raising Airbaltic's share capital.
Piterniece also pointed out that after Wednesday's meeting of Airbaltic shareholders, BAS representatives Ilmars 
Razumovskis and Jean-Charles Korsak stood down from the company's supervisory board.
The BAS representative said that the Airbaltic supervisory board at its meeting on Tuesday unanimously supported 
the board's proposal to raise Airbaltic's share capital, but on the next day proposal was rejected by the Latvian 
government. "This suggests that Airbaltic's biggest shareholder [the Latvian state] is intentionally turning against the 
airline's interests. Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis' personal stance, covered up by his position, is evident behind 
these actions taken by the Latvian state as the biggest shareholder. Mr. Dombrovskis is ruining Airbaltic on 
purpose," Piterniece claimed.
The government, as the majority shareholder, has not been a good and responsible manager of the airline over the 
past four years, as payments to other carriers have been reduced, and airport fees cut for Ireland's Ryanair, but not 
for Airbaltic, Piterniece said.
BAS ready to buy state-held shares in Latvia 's Airbaltic carrier
"Government officials have been meeting with other potential investors, ignoring the existing partners. The 
destructive actions of government representatives reached a new level this summer when Economics Minister Artis 
Kampars and the prime minister publicly announced their support for them. Because of these actions, the airline's 
losses have reached tens of millions of lats," said BAS representative.
She went on to claim that Dombrovskis failed to realize the seriousness of the situation, although the Airbaltic 
supervisory board had agreed on the need to raise the company's capital urgently. The responsible officials have 
more than enough information to take the decision, but still they are refusing to act, the BAS representative said.
The supervisory board of the Latvian national airline Airbaltic has proposed that the company's share capital should 
be increased by 63.7 million lats (EUR 90.64 mln), including 30 million lats through conversion of the bonds already 
held by the Latvian state-owned electronic services provider Latvijas Valsts Radio un Televizijas Centrs (LVRTC, 
Latvian State Radio and Television Center) and the Airbaltic private shareholder, Baltijas Aviacijas Sistemas (BAS, 
Baltic Aviation Systems), the Transport Ministry told BNS.
Augulis asked Dombrovskis earlier to call a government meeting on the issue already on Wednesday.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from all three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares, and Baltijas 
Aviacijas Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent. A 50 percent stake in BAS belongs to 
Airbaltic CEO Bertolt Flick, and another 50 stake is held by Taurus Asset Management Fund Limited, a company 
registered in the Bahamas.

EU commisiioner Kallas not satisified with cheap flight airlines
BRUSSELS, Aug 12, BNS - Transport Commissioner of the European Union Siim Kallas is not satisfied with low-
cost airlines that attract clients with very low prices but when booking a ticket then it appears that the final sum is 
considerably higher, the Norwegian internet publication DN.no wrote.
Kallas finds that all the fees must be immediately reflected in the ticket price and a stop should have to be put to the 
fooling of clients.
The Spanish Spanair, the Irish Ryanair and the British Easyjet are under investigation. The study will be completed 
by the fall and it is to be expected that the low-cost airlines' price policy will become fairer then.
Already in June Kallas expressed dissatisfaction with Ryanair's price policy, which did not show the fee for the 
payment of for the ticket by credit card and internet check-in, as well as the baggage fee and airport taxes.

Passenger traffic at Lithuania's Palanga airport up 5 pct in Jan-Jul
VILNIUS, Aug 02, BNS - Some 62,000 passengers went through the international airport at the Lithuanian seaside 
resort of Palanga in the first seven months of this year, up 5 percent from 59,000 in the same period last year.
In July alone, passenger traffic declined by 9 percent, year-on-year, to 11,200, the airport said on its website.
Palanga Airport director Jolanta Juceviciute told BNS that the decline resulted on passengers' preference for 
budget carriers like Ryanair, which offers flights from Vilnius and Kaunas, and Wizz Air, which operates from 
Vilnius.
According to the data made available by the airport, the airlines carried out 1,700 flights to and from Palanga in 
January-July and 322 in July alone.
In 2010 the airport handled 3,150 flights and 102,500 passengers, down 2 percent from 2009 and 5 percent less 
than planned.

Riga airport serves most passengers on flights with Germany, UK, Finland in H1
RIGA, Jul 19, BNS - In the first six months of this year International Airport Riga served most passengers on flights 
to and from Germany, the UK and Finland, said the airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Bunka-Brilijonka.
She said that in the first six months of this year the airport served 284,399 passengers on German routes, 277,052 
passengers on British routes, and 227,924 passengers on Finnish routes.
Bunka-Brilijonka said that in the said period 65 out of 86 destinations from Riga saw the number of passengers 
growsing, including by 200,000 passengers to such destinations as Moscow, Vilnius, Helsinki, Oslo, London, Kiev, 
Rome, Antalya, Tallinn, Amsterdam.
"The growth in the number of passenger can be explained with the fact that new airlines started flying on several 
routes and the existing airlines increased the number of flights," said the airport's board chairman Arnis Luhse.
The airport said that in the first half of last year flights to Moscow were served by Latvian national carrier Airbaltic 
and Russian company Aeroflot, but this year these flights are served by four airlines -- Airbaltic, Aeroflot, Transaero 
and UTair. The number of passengers on Vilnius flights has risen because Airbaltic has increased the number of 
flights to this destination.
This year Airbaltic, Ryanair and WizzAir serve most passengers at Riga airport.
The airport representative said that Riga airport serves the majority of Baltic air passengers -- in the first six months 
of this year 60 percent of air passengers at Vilnius, Tallinn and Riga airports were served by Riga -- 2,384,909 
travellers as compared to 870,045 passengers in Tallinn and 715,296 passengers in Vilnius.

Lithuanian airports post strong growth in H1 - daily
VILNIUS, Jul 12, BNS - Many airlines took Lithuania off their maps several years ago, but local airports' results for 
the first half of this year show an obvious improvement in this situation, the daily Lietuvos Rytas reported on 
Tuesday.
The country's three international airports saw a considerable increase in first-half passenger traffic, with Kaunas 
Airport leading the way. However, they started putting spokes into each other's wheels in an effort to attract more 
passengers, it wrote.
A total of 186,100 passengers went through Vilnius International Airport in June, a rise of 24.5 percent year-on-
year.
The Lithuanian-based charter carrier Small Planet Airlines topped the list, handling 17 percent of the airport's 
passenger traffic last month. Ireland's budget airline Ryanair, which had launched operations in Vilnius just two 
months earlier, got the second-biggest chunk in June, at 15 percent. Hungary's Wizz Air, operating at the airport 
since April, accounted for 13 percent.
Kaunas International Airport posted an impressive 40 percent annual rise in passenger numbers for the first half of 
this 
year, 
but 
passenger 
traffic 
in 
June 
dropped 
by 
almost 
10 
percent 
year-on-year.                  
"The reasons (for the decline) are simple: Wizz Air began to operate flights from the capital and Ryanair also 
launched flights from Vilnius to Girona, in Spain, and Milan, in Italy," Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas said.                  
Palanga International Airport handled 50,600 passengers in the first half of this year, a rise of 9 percent on the 
same time last year.

Ryanair not to start flying from Tukums before 2015 - Riga airport head
RIGA, Jul 12, BNS - Irish low-costs airline Ryanair is unlikely to start flying from the western Latvian town of 
Tukums before 2015, Riga airport CEO Arnis Luhse predicted in an interview with BNS.
Commenting reports that Ryanair might open its Latvian hub in Tukums, the head of Riga airport said that there had 
been no official announcements as yet. "I do not think that this is serious, because they already have quite good 
terms in Riga," Luhse said, adding that the terms are not going to change until Ryanair's contract with the Latvian 
Transport Ministry expires in 2015.
"As far as I know Ryanair is very proud of the opportunity to land at the airport of the capital city... So I am pretty 
sure that Ryanair will not move to Tukums before 2015," said Luhse.
Riga airport is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

VILNIUS, Jul 12, BNS - Some 50,600 passengers went through the international airport at the Lithuanian seaside

However, Palanga Airport Director Jolanta Juceviciute said that growth in passenger numbers slowed down in 
June, as low-cost airlines operating flights from Vilnius and Kaunas drew some passengers away from the smaller 
airport in Palanga.
"Passenger traffic grew by an annual 14 percent in the first five months of this year, which was quite a good result. 
Growth was slower in June. Passengers are choosing low-fare carriers: Ryanair and Wizz Air offered return flights 
to Rome and Barcelona for several hundred litas," she said.
Palanga Airport handled a total of 102,500 passengers last year, down 2 percent from 104,600 passengers in 2009.

Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air considers opening hub at Riga airport
RIGA, Jul 08, BNS - Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is considering a possibility to open a hub in Riga, said Riga 
airport's board chairman Arnis Luhse.
He said that most often interest in operations at Riga airport is voiced by low-cost airlines. "Most believably, Wizz 
Air might expand its operations in Riga. This company has voiced interest in opening its hub in Riga. It is very good 
because if any airline decides to make a hub in Riga, it means it is here for a long time," said Luhse, reminding that 
a hub of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has been discussed for a while, but nothing happened eventually.
According to Luhse, Wizz Air seems more ready for this step and wishes to use the hub for its flights to Spain. "It is 
very good for as as there are not many flights to this country. I believe that this is the most realistic project, and 
talks are underway," he said.
He said that a hub is very good for the airport. If there is just one airplane staying overnights, it means that an 
airshed should be built, during winter the airplane is protected against icing. "It is a set of services. Another 
advantage is security -- if a company has made its hub here, it means that it will not leave our airport in the coming 
five years," he said.
Asked about Wizz Air's possible investments, Luhse said that it has not been revealed to the airport. "We have not 
discussed any figures. We are interested for the project to develop," he said.
Luhse also said that it is not good that one company -- Latvia's national carrier Airbaltic -- ensures 66 percent of the 
airport's turnover, and other airlines have to be attracted to diversify risks. "The situation [with one dominating 
airline] has formed historically. It is a giant on a clay leg. What if anything happens with this leg. However, other 
airlines are not rushing to Riga, either," he said.

Riga airport to produce new discount system for airlines soon
RIGA, Jun 29, BNS - The Riga international airport in the Latvian capital will soon produce a new discount system 
for the airlines operating out of this airport, Arnis Luhse, the CEO of the airport company, said in the interview to 
BNS.
He said that the discounts should be understandable and known to everyone, all airlines should be aware of them 
on January 1. ,,For example, if an airline brings one million passengers to Riga, different prices would apply after 
the one-million-and-one passenger. If an airline launches a flight to a location not served by other airlines, it would 
get a lower price for one year," Luhse said.
He said that there were only two airlines in the Riga airport, which could claim volume discounts, therefore the 
airport would offer other discounts as well, for example, on new destinations.
Luhse said that the airport had come up with those ideas but it would be up to the government to put them into life.
On November 1, 2009, the Riga airport changed the tariff policy, giving up the old system of volume discounts that 
were to the benefit of two airlines carrying large numbers of passengers - the Latvian national airline Airbaltic and 
the Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair.
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company.

Ryanair extends minimum online booking period in Lithuania, Latvia to 7 days
VILNIUS, Jun 10, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair suggests that Lithuanian and Latvian residents who want 
to book the airline's flights within seven days before travel should do so by contacting its call center.
"Due to a higher than average level of potentially fraudulent activity Ryanair has extended its minimum online 
booking period to seven days before travel on all Lithuanian routes to/from Kaunas and Vilnius and all Latvian 
routes to/from Riga," Stephen McNamara, the head of communications at Ryanair, told BNS.
"Passengers who wish to book and travel on these routes (from Kaunas, Vilnius and Riga) within seven days can 
do so by contacting Ryanair's call centers," he said.
With no call centers available in Lithuania and Latvia, Ryanair recommends calling its call center in Britain. The 
airline charges an additional fee for booking by telephone.
McNamara said that VISA-owned Cybersource would provide real-time monitoring of bookings in Lithuania, Latvia 
and other countries under an agreement signed last Tuesday.
"To ensure continued security Ryanair has appointed Cybersource, a VISA company, to provide fraud management 
and payment processing services which will allow the real-time review of bookings to decide whether they should 
be accepted, rejected, or marked for further investigation," the official said.
"Ryanair continues to monitor booking activity on all routes," he added.
Cybersource is able to access up to 200 global validation tests when screening for fraud via its global fraud 
management portal.
Ryanair extends minimum online booking period in Lithuania , Latvia to 7 days
Jurate Baltrusaityte of Kaunas Airport told BNS that, to her knowledge, Ryanair had applied such booking 
restrictions for a certain period of time in 2005, when it entered the Lithuanian market, as well as at the start of its 
operations in Latvia.
The airport's official said that the airline could have been prompted to impose the restrictions by a rise in the 
number of cases of passengers using other persons' personal and bank card data to make their bookings.
"However, such a passengers runs the risk of being detained at any time," Baltrusaityte said.
Passengers can purchase tickets to Ryanair flights at the airport up to several hours before the flight, she added.
Around 99 percent of Ryanair's bookings are made via its website and only a small part through its call center.

Low-cost airlines bringing 350,000 additional visitors to Estonia this year
TALLINN, Jun 08, BNS - Low-cost airlines are estimated to bring 350,000 additional visitors to the Estonian capital 
Tallinn during 2011, board chairman of the state-owned company AS Tallinna Lennujaam (Tallinn Airport) Erik 
Sakkov said.
Speaking at a transport and tourism conference held at the airport's facilities, Sakkov said the number of 
passengers of low-cost airlines served since the beginning of the year reached 150,000 on Wednesday. The 
current forecast by the airport company says the number of passengers served by the airport will grow by one 
million over the next three or four years.
A survey conducted by the airport among Ryanair passengers shows that 43 percent of the passengers of Ryanair 
here are incoming tourists, 38 percent Estonian residents flying out, 15 percent residents of Russia using the 
opportunity to travel via Tallinn using Ryanair, while the remaining 4 percent include residents of Finland and Latvia.
As Sakkov said, the airport of Tallinn has started to approach the balanced model of operation where one-third of 
the passenger volume is made up of passengers of the national airline, one-third by passengers using low-cost 
airlines, and the rest of passengers using the services of other airlines taking passengers to bigger airports.
Cooperation with airline companies from Asia and particularly the Far East may help solve the problem of shortage 
of passengers, Sakkov said. Helsinki and Tallinn are the two European Union airports situated closest to the Far 
East and Finnair has been using that geographical advantage for some time already, he said.
Flights headed from India and the Gulf region to New York and Washington pass over Estonia and there is the 
possibility that some of such flights will be landing in Tallinn, offering cooperation opportunities for Estonian Air and 
the opportunity for people here to board a direct flight to New York.

Estonian Air needs at least 15 planes - CEO
TALLINN, Jun 08, BNS - Estonian Air needs to double the size of its fleet to 15 aircraft from the present seven in 
order to build up a new network of destinations, the company's newly appointed CEO Tero Taskila said.
"We are too small to survive," Taskila said at a transport and tourism conference at Tallinn Airport on Wednesday. 
He said that with 15 aircraft the company would be able to serve 1.5 million customers annually. According to 
aviation analysts the minimum fleet size for an airline company to survive at present is from 35 to 45 aircraft.
"We need to keep growing," Taskila said. For that investments are needed, but if support is there the company is 
confident that it can ensure productivity of the investments. "You can't remain dependent on state support forever," 
the CEO said.
Taskila said Estonian Air needs to keep its mind open to cooperation opportunities and even possible takeovers. As 
an example, he named setting up a joint venture with some airline company from the Far East.
The recently acquired Bombardier CRJ jets are good planes to fly to nearby destinations, but some of the markets 
for Estonian Air are not near enough for CRJs. "An analysis needs to be conducted of the necessity to replace 
Boeing 737s," Taskila said.
Taskila said Estonian Air will publish its plan concerning new destinations and frequencies in the next few weeks. 
He said one doesn't need to fly always to capitals and consideration should be given to offering a unique route. In 
expanding its operations Estonian Air will keep its eyes on markets where it would be possible to earn a profit.
As Taskila said, all airline companies are global now. Estonian Air is small enough to be able to change easily, 
whereas the company's ownership structure helps to ensure stability.
Estonian Air needs at least 15 planes - CEO
Also the chairman of the supervisory board of Estonian Air, Joakim Helenius, said that Estonian Air could become 
an intercontinental airline.
The Estonian minister of economy and communications, Juhan Parts, said the government had the possibility to let 
Estonian Air go bankrupt. "But we decided on a takeover," Parts said. The government's goal was to bring in a new 
management that was capable of putting down its feet in tight competition. Profitable operation of the company and 
increasing the number of destinations are possible, said Parts.
The coming of Ryanair to Tallinn is good in the long-term perspective, Parts said. In his words it would be possible 
for the government to make all other airline companies except Estonian Air leave the airport of Tallinn in six months. 
"But, viewing things in a broader perspective, you shouldn't be protecting your own weakness by flattening down 
the strength of others," said Parts. The ministers added that one should become strong in the existing competition 
situation instead.
It is only in the last order that consideration should be given to subsidizing international routes with public sector 
money, said Parts.
Estonia needs a national airline company to ensure stable availability of flight connections, said Taskila, because 
without the latter direct foreign investments cannot be brought in. Estonia has a very good image internationally and 
Estonian Air should serve as the country's business card, he added.
The year 2011 is emerging as one of the worst years ever for aviation in terms of profitability, because fuel prices 
have grown and business has been affected by natural disasters and the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, in the 
Baltic countries aviation has managed to survive the crisis and is growing, Taskila said.

Ryanair may invest up to EUR 5 mln in Kaunas
VILNIUS, Jun 03, BNS - Ireland 's budget carrier Ryanair is mulling a possibility to set up an aircraft maintenance, 
repair and operations (MRO) unit in Kaunas, which it may invest up to 5 million euros in. Moreover, the air carrier 
may hire up to 60 specialists for the unit, which will service the company's aircraft.
"We want to employ and train up to 60 aircraft engineers and mechanics. Experience in aircraft engineering will not 
be required since we will provide training. We hope to find people who are experienced in mechanics and know 
English. We hope that our offer could interest auto and other mechanics who are looking for new challenges and 
attractive career in aviation," a statement from Invest Lithuania, the government's investment promotion agency, 
quoted Michael Hickey, Director of Engineering at Ryanair, as saying.
Hickey told the Verslo Zinios business daily that the company would need an area of 3,500 square meters, so that 
the hangar could accommodate a Boeing 737-800, if it decided to invest in Kaunas.
"According to our estimations, investments into this unit would reach up to 5 million euros," Hickey said adding that 
this investment, if successful, would prove a long-term obligation by Ryanair to develop and strengthen aircraft 
maintenance industry, as did the investment in Prestwick.
Ryanair operates an MRO center at Prestwick Airport (Glasgow). The company invested 9 million euros into the 
center and created 200 jobs.
Ryanair established a base at Kaunas airport in May 2010. The company carried more than 925,000 passengers in 
the first year of operations of its base in the second largest Lithuania's city.
Ryanair has also launched flights from Vilnius since then.

Baltic Aviation System gives no start date for Vilnius flights - daily
VILNIUS, May 23, BNS - Baltic Aviation Systems (BAS) had plans to begin regular flights from Vilnius to seven 
destinations in April, but now gives no possible dates for the launch of operations in the Lithuanian capital, the daily 
Kauno Diena reported on Monday.
The company's managers say that they have not given up plans to offer flights from Lithuania, but with the change 
of circumstances, they have decided not to rush, the paper wrote.
Meanwhile, Kestutis Auryla, the director of the Lithuanian Civil Aviation Administration (CAA), says that BAS has 
declared its intention to launch flights at the start of the winter season, which is the last Sunday of October, but 
admits that BAS' certification process is not as successful as they would want it to be.
Bertolt Flick, a shareholder of BAS, says that the company has not dropped plans to establish an air carrier in 
Lithuania, but admits that there are certain difficulties.
Flick is also the CEO and a shareholder of Latvia's Airbaltic.
"We want to set up an airline in Lithuania that would operate daily flights to the main destinations. Why do we want 
this? In fact, this is more a technical problem. Airbaltic has started competing with itself, and the biggest always 
wins. All air carriers that have two hubs close to each other are faced with this problem. Therefore, we want to set 
up a new airline and we will definitely do so," he said.
Kristian Kirchheiner, the CEO of BAS, says that the company has halted its plans to start flights operations in 
Lithuania due to various circumstances, such as a 40 percent rise in aviation fuel prices since last autumn, the 
disaster in Japan, the unrest in Northern Africa, and definitely the recent launch of Vilnius flights by two low-cost 
airlines.                                                                                   Kirchheiner says that the company has not abandoned 
its plans to start operations in Lithuania, and now is watching how Wizz Air and Ryanair are doing in Vilnius,

Ryanair carries over 925,000 pax in 1st year of Kaunas base
VILNIUS, May 05, BNS - Ireland's low fares airline Ryanair carried more than 925,000 passengers in the first year 
after opening its base at Kaunas Airport.
"We hope to continue our successful cooperation with Ryanair, not only by offering exceptional flight destinations, 
but also by developing other aviation projects," Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas said in a press release.
The airport and companies in the area around the airport recruited 40 percent more people during the first 12 
months after the launch of the base than in the same period a year ago. Ryanair's base at the airport has helped to 
create and sustain more than 750 jobs in the region, according to the press release.
Data from the tourism sector show that the number of Finnish, British and German visitors to Lithuania's second-
biggest city of Kaunas has increased several times.
Ryanair in May 2010 opened its first Central and Eastern European aircraft base in Kaunas. It launched flights to 18 
European destinations from its Kaunas base.

Vilnius airport expects influx of foreign tourists - daily
VILNIUS, May 03, BNS - Vilnius International Airport (VIA) expects tourist numbers to rise by one-third this summer, 
the daily Lietuvos Rytas reported on Tuesday.
VIA estimates that at least 100,000 more foreigners will come to Vilnius in the period from May to October 
compared with the same period last year, when around 300,000 tourists visited the Lithuanian capital for at least an 
overnight stay, it wrote.
The airport pins its hopes on the launch of services by two budget carriers and additional flights by existing 
operators.
Ireland's Ryanair started flights to and from Vilnius on Monday, following Wizz Air's launch of services at VIA in mid-
April. The two low-cost airlines are expected to carry 50,000 to 60,000 passengers during the summer season.
According to data from the Vilnius Tourism Information Center, last year the largest increase was registered in the 
number of tourists from Belarus, at 58 percent. The number of Russian tourists rose by 20 percent.

Ryanair pays Vilnius airport EUR 2 per passenger
VILNIUS, May 02, BNS - The only fee that Ireland's budget airline Ryanair pays Vilnius International Airport, in 
which it launched operations on Monday, is 2 euros per passenger.
"The same terms and conditions apply to other carriers that commit themselves to transporting at least 250,000 
passengers yearly. The company pays the only fee, which is 2 euros per passenger," the Delfi.lt online news site 
quoted Vilnius Airport CEO Tomas Vaisvila as saying on Monday.
Wizz Air, another low-cost airline that started flights to and from Vilnius this spring, is also expected to carry 
250,000 passengers every year.
"The Lithuanian market is very suitable for low fares carriers," the airport's CEO said.
Vaisvila said that he does not think that the arrival of Ryanair and Wizz Air will affect traditional airlines' operations.
He added that the airport is working to attract other European budget airlines as well.
Deputy Transport Minister Rimvydas Vastakas told Delfi.lt that Vilnius Airport still has room for growth.
"Talks with four to five companies are underway all the time, but we don't want to provide any information until they 
are completed. If we compare Vilnius Airport with Riga's, we'll see that we still have much work to do. I think we 
could expand into certain Asian countries and Russian airports, as well as Israel," he said.
Ryanair offers flights from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and the second-biggest city of Kaunas to 24 destinations.

Airbaltic to stop flights from Vilnius to Copenhagen
VILNIUS, Apr 28, BNS - Latvia's air carrier Airbaltic will stop flights from Vilnius to Copenhagen from May 14, the 
company's spokeswoman, Rosita Sakalauskaite, confirmed to BNS.
Airbaltic now offers seven weekly flights from Vilnius to the capital of Denmark and back.
"This decision has been taken in the light of the passenger flow, which is too small today compared with the existing 
supply. Replanning of operations with more focus on popular summer destinations also had its effects. For those 
passengers who have already acquired tickets to those flights from Vilnius we will offer the most suitable 
alternatives individually," Sakalauskaite told BNS.
Neither Wizz Air, the Hungarian low-cost carrier that started operations in Vilnius several weeks ago, nor Ryanair, 
Ireland's budget carrier that would launch flights from the Lithuanian capital from early May, will offer flights to 
Copenhagen for the meantime.
Scandinavia's SAS offers flights to the capital of Denmark from the airports of Vilnius and Palanga.

Easyjet's Liverpool flights expected to bring 13,000 tourists annually to Estonia
TALLINN, Apr 26, BNS - The Tallinn-Liverpool flights of the British budget airline Easyjet may bring about 13,000 
tourists annually to Estonia, a board member of Tallinna Lennujaam, the state-owned operator of the Tallinn airport, 
says.
Easyjet plans to attract 35,000 passengers annually, the board member, Erik Sakkov, told BNS on Tuesday at the 
launch of the new route. Around half passengers will be flying to Liverpool and the other half, to Tallinn, and 70 
percent of them will be incoming tourists, he said.
Alison Flint, departmental head with the Liverpool tourism center, who arrived in Tallinn with the first Easyjet flight 
on Tuesday, told reporters culture and art are the main reasons why visit Liverpool, a former European capital of 
culture.
The airline will be making three flights weekly, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. The flight takes three hours. 
Planes will depart from Liverpool in the morning and return in the afternoon. The airline said prices of one-way 
tickets inclusive of airport charges start at 19.99 euros.
Easyjet at present flies from Tallinn also to London. Sakkov said the Tallinn airport "very much hopes" that the 
airline will resume flights to Berlin and open a route from Tallinn to Paris as well.
With regard to the other British low cost airline Ryanair that launched flights out of Tallinn in December, Sakkov said 
"they have been very professional."
Sakkov added that the Tallinn airport would be pleased if Ryanair started flying to Rome and Malaga from Tallinn. 
In his words, Milan, Duesseldorf, London and Dublin are currently the most popular destinations offered by Ryanair 
while the Oslo and Stockholm routes could do with more passengers.

As to passenger flows of the Tallinn airport, Sakkov said that as of the end of last week the number of passengers 
showed 34.5 percent growth since the beginning of the year. Last week the airport served 34,119 passengers, 
30,139 on regular and 3,828 on charter flights, which is twice as many as during the same period last year.

Airbaltic: we hope that second try by Wizz Air to do business in Lithuania will be successful
VILNIUS, Apr 15, BNS - Forecasts by Hungary's budget carrier Wizz Air that its rival, Latvian-owned Airbaltic, might 
pull out of Vilnius Airport in several years' time have triggered a war of words.
Tadas Vizgirda, Airbaltic's general manager for Lithuania, wished to Wizz Air that the second try of the company to 
do business in Lithuania was successful.
"We hope that the second attempt of this budget carrier to operate flights from Lithuania will be much more 
successful than its first attempt when the flights from Kaunas Airport were suspended in just six months. We also 
remember another rose-colored air carrier [FlyLAL], which spoke out loud about possible withdrawal of Airbaltic, but 
unfortunately it was  people who were left with rosy hopes to recover their money paid for the flights that have not 
been carried out by the company," Vizgirda said in a statement.
He expressed regret that the new players entering the Lithuanian market were primarily focused on competitive 
fight instead of long-term vision of their operations.
"Competition reduces the prices of flights in the short-term, which, of course, is useful for passengers. However, it 
makes the air carriers more sensitive to market changes, in particular the growth of fuel prices, which may correct 
their plans considerably," Vizgirda said.
The chief executive officer of Hungary's low-fares airline Wizz Air, which is launching regular flights from Vilnius on 
Saturday, said that his company is not afraid to face competition from its Irish rival Ryanair, which is starting flights 
from the Lithuanian capital next month.
"We have our business principles and other companies have theirs. Competition is part of life. It may be from 
Ryanair, Easyjet or other companies. In Poland, we've been competing with Ryanair for almost six years, and we 
Airbaltic: we hope that second try by Wizz Air to do business in Lithuania will be successful
are number one there now. I don't see any reasons why we couldn't work together successfully in Lithuania," Wizz 
Air CEO Joseph Varadi said at a news conference in Vilnius on Friday.
Varadi said that he doubted if Estonian Air and Airbaltic would continue operating in Vilnius Airport in the future 
since the operating costs of those companies were far larger compared with the budget carriers.
"I'd be very surprised to see Estonian Air and Airbaltic staying in Vilnius Airport in three years' time," he said.
Latvia's Airbaltic scrapped four routes from Vilnius, to Dublin, London, Rome and Paris, in late March.
Wizz Air will base one aircraft in Vilnius. The company, which employs a workforce of 1,300, says to be the largest 
budget carrier in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).

Passenger traffic at Kaunas airport up 77 pct in Q1 y-o-y
VILNIUS, Apr 14, BNS - A total of 219,900 passengers went through the Kaunas International Airport, the second 
largest in Lithuania, in the first quarter of this year, up 77.3 percent from the same period last year.
"Obviously it is the effect of Ryanair's base again. We will mark the first year since its opening in May and we will 
observe the subsequent growth rate compared with the passenger traffic before the opening of the base and will 
continue the expansion of the base," Arijandas Sliupas, the airport's CEO, told BNS.
The number of flights at the airport soared by 43.7 percent, year-on-year, to 2,212 in January-March, whereas 
cargo handling plummeted by 50.6 percent, to 365.7 tons.
The airport is targeting an 11 percent rise in annual passenger numbers to over 900,000 this year. A total of 
809,700 passengers went through Kaunas Airport last year, up 77 percent from 456,700 passengers in 2009.
Ryanair currently offers 16 routes from Kaunas and Airbaltic operates a direct service to Riga.

Riga airport plans to serve by 200,000 more passengers y-o-y during summer season
RIGA, Apr 13, BNS - International airport Riga during the summer season plans to serve by 200,000 more 
passengers year-on-year, said the airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Bunka-Brilijonka.
"Taking into account the planned passenger growth, new boarding sectors will be built in the airport premises by 
June 1. We plan to employ more people for passenger service for the summer season," said the airport's board 
chairman Arnis Luhse.
He said that the airport's capacity is restricted, therefore the airport has to work on serving passengers at high 
quality.
Bunka-Brilijonka said that in the 2011 summer season the airport plans to increase the number of flights by 16 
percent year-on-year. The number of flights will be increased to such destinations as Kiev in Ukraine, Lappeenranta 
in Finland, Vilnius in Lithuania, Berlin in Germany, Kaliningrad in Russia, Bergen in Norway, Helsinki in Finland and 
others.
She said that this year two new companies will launch work at the Riga airport -- Skyways flying 13 times a week to 
and from Goteborg in Sweden, and El Al/Sundor, which plans to launch flights to and from Tel Aviv in Israel.
Six new destinations will also be launched from the Riga airport -- Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier will fly four times 
a week to Budapest in Hungary and Gdansk in Poland and once a week to Bari in Italy and Tenerife in the Canary 
Islands, Turkish Airlines will fly twice a week to Antalya in Turkey, and Ryanair low-cost airlines will fly four times  a 
week to Ciampino airport in Rome, Italy.
Riga airport plans to serve by 200,000 more passengers y-o-y during summer season
The international airport of Riga served almost 940,000 passengers during the first quarter of 2011 at a 3 percent 
rise from the same period in 2010. The airport served slightly more than 15,000 flights and 2,800 tons of cargos in 
the said period.
In 2010 the airport served a total of 4.664 million passengers at a 14.7 percent rise from 2009.
The Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company. The Riga airport is the largest air traffic hub in the 
Baltics.

Kaunas Airport cuts losses by 39 pct in 2010
VILNIUS, Apr 08, BNS - The Kaunas International Airport, the second largest in Lithuania, saw its losses contract 
by 39 percent, to 1.686 million litas (EUR 0.48 mln) in 2010, from 2.785 million litas in 2009.
The revenues shrank by 6.8 percent, to 3.61 million litas, the company said in a 2010 report submitted to the Center 
of Registers.
Last year the passenger traffic through the airport soared by 77 percent, year-on-year, to 809,700.
"The company's revenues on non-aviation activities soared after the opening of a Ryanair's base in May 2010 and 
accounted for 56 percent of total revenues at the end of the year. The growth in revenues on parking lots, fuel taxes 
and advertising was particularly strong. The revenues from the turnover of cafes and stores grew considerably amid 
an increase in purchasing power," the report said.
The airport did not provide any performance figures expected for 2011.

Latvian court refuses to accept LGS air traffic controller's lawsuit against Ryanair
RIGA, Mar 28, BNS - Riga Regional Court has refused to accept a lawsuit Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (LGS) air traffic 
controller has filed against Ireland's low-costs airline Ryanair over a 262,900 lats (EUR 374,000) debt, De Facto, an 
analytical news program of Latvian public television (LTV), reported on Sunday.
According to LTV, the Riga Regional Court refused to accept the lawsuit because it believes that the case does not 
fall within its competence.
LGS is reportedly planning to appeal this decision, but the case might be dropped if it has to be heard by a foreign 
court, because it might then cost too much to LGS.
Under the agreement with Ryanair, such disputes have to be heard by a British court, but in the LGS case the 
lawsuit might end up with an Irish court.
LGS head Davids Taurins told De Facto: "I do not think that it would be worth going to an Irish court if we are 
indeed forced to do so. Litigation costs might be significantly higher in Ireland, and it would not be expedient from 
the business, the rational point of view."
Regardless of whether the legal dispute gets to court, Taurins said that LGS might use its legal rights to detain 
Ryanair planes in Riga until the carrier pays off its debts.
LGS has filed a lawsuit with the Riga Regional Court claiming a 262,900 lats debt from Ryanair.
LGS is a fully state-owned company providing air navigation services to air space users.

Latvia's LGS air traffic controller not planning radical steps to recover Ryanair debt
RIGA, Mar 25, BNS - Latvian air traffic controller Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme ( LGS), which is responsible for managing 
air traffic in Latvia, is not planning any radical steps to recover a 262,900 lats (EUR 374,000) debt from Ireland's 
low-costs airline Ryanair, LGS board chairman Davids Taurins said in an interview with Dienas Bizness (DB) 
newspaper.
"I am not a supporter of radicalism. We must seek justice in court and prove that they have to pay us for services 
they have received from us. Ryanair operates flights here and does it frequently, so radicalism would be 
inappropriate in this case. Admittedly, the sum the airline owes to us is not critical to my company, but the trend is 
unpleasant," Taurins said.
The LGS head noted that the Irish no-frills carrier has been withholding payments for air navigation services in Riga 
airport's terminal area for a longer period of time. "We have talked to them about the necessity to meet the 
payments, and in August 2010 Ryanair paid a part of the debt, but then stopped paying again, and the debt kept 
growing. We tried to persuade them again that paying the debt would be the best solution, but they are not paying 
attention. As a result, the debt for services provided by our company has grown to 262,900 lats," Taurins said.
Ryanair has not provided any explanations for its failure to pay its debt to LGS. "Frankly, it is difficult for me to 
comment, because I have not received full information. We will probably learn everything in court. During 
negotiations Ryanair referred to some agreements I have never seen. All I know is that we have provided services 
to Ryanair and have not received money for them."
LGS has filed a lawsuit with the Riga Regional Court claiming the 262,900 lats from Ryanair.

Latvian air traffic control co LGS takes Ryanair to court over EUR 374,000 debt
(adds comments from court)
RIGA, Mar 24, BNS - The Latvian air traffic control company Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (LGS), which is responsible 
for managing air traffic in Latvia, has submitted with the Riga Regional Court a claim against the Irish low-cost 
airline Ryanair for collection of a debt in the amount of 262,900 lats (EUR 374,000).
LGS spokeswoman Iveta Virse told BNS that the Ryanair debt was for air navigation services in the terminal area. 
She said that debt collection in the aviation industry was governed by international laws and the Aviation Law, 
which provides for the right to delay departure of an aircraft.
"Having reviewed the legal remedies and the likely consequences, LGS for now decided to take the option of filing a 
claim with the court as it would have the least possible adverse effect on the public interests," Virse said.
Riga Regional Court representative Ingars Sprukts told BNS that so far the court had not started any proceeding on 
the subject and he could not comment on the applications of claims that the court had not yet accepted for hearing.

Riga airport does not plan to get rid of  Ireland's Ryanair
RIGA, Mar 22, BNS - Riga international airport does not plan to get rid of Ireland's low-costs airline Ryanair, said 
the airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Bunka-Briljonka.
Commenting information published by Nothing Personal, an analytical news program of Latvia's TV3 channel, that 
the airport wants to get rid of Ryanair and the Latvian Transport Ministry, which is currently controlled by the Greens 
and Farmers Union (ZZS), is planning to move the no-frills carrier from Riga to a privately-owned airfield in Tukums, 
in central-western Latvia. Riga airport, meanwhile, intends to refocus on serving conventional, big carriers, the 
airport's representative said that airport has not extended such a proposal to the airline.
"Riga airport has not made such a proposal to Ryanair and Ryanair has not made such a proposal to the airport. If 
Ryanair chooses to move to Tukums airport, then its decisions, most believably, will be based on lower airport fees 
offered by Tukums," she said.
She also said that the agreement between the airport and Ryanair is effective until 2015 and there are no plans to 
revise it at present.
The airport's board chairman Arnis Luhse said that the airport at present does not have any correspondence with 
Ryanair or any other low-costs airline about their moving to Tukums.
Nothing Personal reported earlier that the international airport of Riga wants to get rid of Ireland's low-costs airline 
Ryanair. According to the TV program, the airport's new administration has come to a conclusion that the Ryanair 
business is disadvantageous to the airport. Not only because of the low fees, but also because clients of the low-
costs airline do not use restaurants and stores. Furthermore, the old companies do not grow as swiftly as the no-
frills airlines, for which Riga would need a new terminal.
Luhse told TV3 that ideally the airport would be serving large airlines instead of the cheap ones.

Riga airport wants to get rid of Ireland's Ryanair - TV
RIGA, Mar 21, BNS - The international airport of Riga wants to get rid of Ireland's low-costs airline Ryanair, Nothing 
Personal, an analytical news program of Latvia's TV3 channel, reported on Sunday.
According to the TV3 report, the Latvian Transport Ministry, which is currently controlled by the Greens and 
Farmers Union (ZZS), is planning to move the no-frills carrier from Riga to a privately-owned airfield in Tukums, in 
central-western Latvia. Riga airport, meanwhile, intends to refocus on serving conventional, big carriers.
Ryanair launched operations in Riga after it was offered to pay a symbolic airport fee and an 80 percent tax rebate 
at Riga airport, which at that time was serving such European companies as SAS, British Airways, KLM and 
Lufthansa. After that, the large and expensive carriers gradually left Riga airport, leaving only two key players in the 
Latvian capital -- Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier and Ryanair. Since 2009, however, Ryanair is charged 130 euros 
per flight, plus 2.5 euros per passenger in Riga.
"The airport's administration has come to a conclusion that the Ryanair business is disadvantageous to the airport. 
Not only because of the low fees, but also because clients of the low-costs airline do not use restaurants and 
stores. Furthermore, the old companies do to grow so swiftly as the no-frills airlines, for which Riga would need a 
new terminal," said TV3 program.
Riga airport CEO Arnis Luhse told TV3 that ideally the airport would be serving large airlines instead of the cheap 
ones.
According to TV3, next week Riga airport is due to present its development strategy, which no longer has place for 
low-costs carriers.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis asserted that communication is under way between Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme air 
traffic controller and Ryanair, as well as between the airport and Ryanair to agree on a "compromise and change of 
Riga airport wants to get rid of Ireland's Ryanair - TV
relations". The minister admitted, that the negotiations are complicated, but voiced hope that communication will 
improve and a consensus will be found.
TV3 notes that Augulis and the ministry's parliamentary secretary Dana Reizniece have already been to Tukums to 
inspect the airfield. Although local residents in Tukums are raising objections to the prospects of airliners regularly 
flying over the small town, the owners of the airfield have already invested four million lats (EUR 5.6 mln) in the 
upgrading of the airfield so that could serve 30 flights a day.
Ryanair managers have been reserved about their plans in Latvia, saying that the company is engaged in talks with 
many airports in Europe and would not comment rumors and speculations.
A state-owned company, Riga airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltics.

Latvia's Airbaltic carrier seeks EUR 34 mln in lawsuit against Riga airport
(expands)
RIGA, Mar 11, BNS - The debt Latvia's Airbaltic claims in a lawsuit against the international airport of Riga has 
grown to 34 million euros already, the airline's vice-president for corporate communications Janis Vanags told BNS.
"Airbaltic has overpaid 34 million euros to Riga airport in recent years, this is our claim against the airport. We do 
not expect Riga airport to repay this amount to us, but we need constructive talks to end discrimination," said 
Vanags.
The Airport representative said that Airbaltic's claim against the airport had been growing by one million euros a 
month.
"Riga airport is still discriminating Airbaltic, charging on the national airport higher fees than on [Ireland's low-costs 
airline] Ryanair," Vanags said.
In his words, the airport's discriminatory treatment of Airbaltic was still preventing the two parties from reaching a 
settlement agreement.
Vanags also pointed out that Riga airport board member Andis Damlics was a board member already at a time 
when the airport concluded the discriminatory agreement with Ryanair. In his words, Transport Minister Uldis 
Augulis has also acknowledged that the agreement with the Irish carrier is disadvantageous to the Latvian state and 
the airport and discriminates Airbaltic.
The fees the airport charges each month on Airbaltic are still several times higher than those charged on Ryanair, 
said Vanags.

Damlics claimed on public television Thursday that Airbaltic was having financial difficulties. "We see that Airbaltic 
is having financial trouble," Damlics said, adding that the carrier was even unable to meet its current payments and 
that delays in a scheduled delivery of new aircraft to Airbaltic was also a proof of that.
Riga airport has been charging advance payments for its services to Airbaltic as of October 8, 2010.
In August 2010, Airbaltic and Riga airport signed a memorandum of understanding to end their prolonged legal 
dispute and ensure further business cooperation. Under the memorandum, the parties involved must settle their 
dispute outside court so that Riga airport did not have to claim the airport's debt in court and Airbaltic withdrew its 
complaint over the airport's tariff policy. The settlement agreement still has not been reached.
Previously the Riga airport filed a claim with the court against Airbaltic national carrier, seeking collection of a debt 
of 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.8 mln) that the airline had accumulated under various commercial contracts with the 
airport since the end of 2009.
Airbaltic in its turn filed with the court a claim against Riga International Airport for six million lats, claiming that the 
airport has been charging discriminatory tariffs from the national carrier.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares and Baltijas Aviacijas 
Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent that previously belonged to the Scandinavian 
airline SAS.
The international airport of Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. The airline is a fully state-owned 
company.

Vilnius schedule.

Riga intl airport to introduce new discount system in late fall
RIGA, Mar 03, BNS - The Riga international airport in the Latvian capital might introduce a new discount system in 
late fall at the latest, the airport's board chairman, Arnis Luhse, said in the interview to the business daily Dienas 
Bizness.
He said that the airport was not forbidden to apply a discount system. "The main thing is that this system should be 
transparent and understandable to everyone. For example, discounts can be applied to airlines serving at least one 
million passengers annually. But this system must be announced publicly. Of course, it will take some time at first to 
discuss and settle the matter on the Transport Ministry level," he said.
But the new discount system is likely to become effective in late fall at the latest. "I would even say - it would be 
very good if it happened this year. We also need to do something about the airport fees in general. For example, at 
present the fee for servicing a transit flight is some four times less than the fee for flights with the destination in 
Riga. But the service costs for both those types of flights are very similar, and it can even be said that serving 
transit passengers is a little more complicated. It is clear that a complex approach to the matter is necessary," 
Luhse said.
When asked which companies currently using the Riga airport services could receive the discounts, he said it was 
not certain yet. "At present the airport can regard as major customers two airlines - Ryanair and Airbaltic. One of 
them serves one million passengers annually, the other even more. Other airlines serve about one percent of the 
total number of passengers. I think that it would be reasonable to negotiate possible discounts with airlines serving 
over 10 percent of total passengers," the airport board chairman said.
Since November 1, 2009, the Riga airport applies tariff policy which no longer provides for volume discounts that 
were previously enjoyed by the airlines serving the largest number of passengers - the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair 
and the Latvian national airline Airbaltic.

Airbaltic drops 4 routes from Vilnius
VILNIUS, Feb 28, BNS - Latvia's airline Airbaltic is revising its summer flights schedule in Vilnius due to 
competition.
The airline said in a press release on Monday that it is canceling four routes from Vilnius, to Dublin, London, Rome 
and Paris, for the summer season starting Mar. 27.
"Coincidentally, both Ryanair and Wizz Air have announced new routes in Vilnius that overlap with those served by 
Airbaltic. The world is big enough, and we rather walk away from the crowd, to avoid the other two airlines flying 
wing-to-wing with each other," Tadas Vizgirda, Airbaltic's general manager for Lithuania, said in the press release.
He said that Vilnius Airport's new discount scheme "appears to have backfired, resulting in overcapacity on just a 
handful of routes rather than broadening the choice of routes."
Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair has said recently that in May it is launching flights from Vilnius to five European 
cities, including London, Dublin, Barcelona, Milan and Rome.  Hungary's budget carrier Wizz Air is starting flights 
from the Lithuanian capital to Cork, Stockholm and Rome on Apr. 16, to London, Milan and Doncaster on Apr. 17, 
and to Eindhoven and Barcelona on Apr. 18.

Latvia's Airbaltic carrier to scrap four routes from Vilnius from March 27
RIGA, Feb 28, BNS - Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier will stop flying passengers to Dublin, London, Rome and 
Paris from Vilnius from March 27, as new rival carriers in Lithuania are offering similar routes, causing overlap and 
overproduction, the airline's vice-president for corporate communications Janis Vanags told BNS.
"Ryanair and Wizzair airlines have announced new routes from Vilnius overlapping with the ones served by 
Airbaltic. There are plenty of destinations in the world to fly to, so we prefer to avoid crowding in order to prevent 
our planes flying wing to wing with the aircraft of the above airlines," Airbaltic's Lithuanian head Tadas Vizgirda said 
in a statement to the press.
Vizgirdas also noted that the new discount system in Vilnius had resulted in an excessively large supply on just a 
few air routes instead of a wide choice of routes.
Airbaltic has apologized to its passengers for inconveniences and offered alternative flights to those who have 
already bought tickets to the cancelled Airbaltic flights.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares and BAS, which

Latvia subsidizes Ryanair, distorts competition - Airbaltic CEO
RIGA, Feb 23, BNS - By applying favorable terms to the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair in respect of services 
provided by the state-owned Riga International Airport in the Latvian capital, the Latvian state is actually subsidizing 
Ryanair and distorting competition, Bertolt Flick, the CEO and President of the Latvian national airline Airbaltic, said 
in the interview to the Neatkariga daily.
"The 2004 agreement between the Riga airport and Ryanair contains very favorable terms. We have the agreement 
with the Riga airport guaranteeing the same terms but the previous management of the airport ignored those 
provisions, which lead to a conflict that is now being handled by the court. The court hearing has been put off till 
April. The Competition Council is also looking into the matter," Flick said.
He said that Airbaltic did not have any differences with the new management of the Riga airport on essential 
matters. ,,We have reached an agreement on all matters that do not concern the said agreement. There is a 
constructive dialogue, and it is good that we can deal with the issues in a businesslike manner. Yet it is 
inacceptable that Airbaltic pays higher fees that Ryanair. In fact the Latvian state is subsidizing Ryanair and 
distorting competition," the Airbaltic CEO said.
In August 2010, Airbaltic and Riga airport signed a memorandum of understanding to end their prolonged legal 
dispute and ensure further business cooperation. Under the memorandum, the parties involved must settle their 
dispute outside the court so that Riga airport did not have to claim the airport's debt in court and Airbaltic would

reached.

of 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.8 mln) that the airline had accumulated under various commercial contracts with the

million lats, claiming that the airport has been charging discriminatory tariffs from the national carrier.

Kaunas airport expects special routes to offset transfer of Ryanair's flights to Vilnius
VILNIUS, Feb 22, BNS - Kaunas Airport expects that flights to Spanish and Greek tourist destinations will attract 
travelers not only from Lithuania but also from neighboring counties and will compensate for the transfer to Vilnius 
of Ryanair's Barcelona and Milan routes.
"There are special routes that are only available from Kaunas, such as Alicante and the Greek islands of Rhodes 
and Kos.  We expect that they will attract both Vilnius residents and travelers from Poland and Latvia, not to 
mention Kaliningrad and Belarus," Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas told reporters on Tuesday.
He said that Belarusians are showing interest in flights from Kaunas.
"We see growth in passenger traffic from Belarus via Kaunas Airport. I think that this number will be even higher in 
the summer, because these routes are exceptional from the regional point of view as well," he said.
Sliupas said that flights to Paris, Germany and London, as well as other routes, are attractive for Belarusian 
travelers.
As part of marketing efforts to attract travelers from Belarus, Kaunas Airport plans to participate in a trade fair in 
Minsk in April and to launch active marketing campaigns in cities in which Lithuania has its consular offices, he said.
Sliupas said that Latvia and Estonia are also planning to simplify their visa procedures. "We have a regional 
competition," he said.
Kaunas Airport this year is targeting a 14.5 percent growth in total passenger numbers to 926,000, up from 809,000 
passengers in 2010.

VILNIUS, Feb 22, BNS - Avia Baltica, a company owned by businessman Yuri Borisov, will build a helicopter repair

Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas told reporters on Tuesday that an agreement with the winner of a land-lease 
auction was signed on Feb. 15.
Sliupas said that Avia Baltica's initial investment will amount to 3 million litas, with the project expected to be 
completed in a year and a half. The hangar must have an area of at least 2,000 square meters.
Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair last year built an aircraft technical maintenance hangar on a leased plot of land in 
Karmelava, a small town close to Kaunas, where the airport is located. The airline started using the hangar in 
October.

Ryanair to offer flights from Vilnius to London, Dublin, Barcelona, Milan, Rome
(expands further)
VILNIUS, Feb 21, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair in May will launch flights from Vilnius to five European 
cities, including London, Dublin, Barcelona, Milan and Rome. The airline, which has a base in Kaunas, says that it 
has no immediate plans to open a base in Vilnius.
Henrike Schmidt, Ryanair's sales and marketing manager, said this at a news conference on Monday. She 
confirmed that the airline will relocate its flights to Barcelona and Milan from Kaunas to Vilnius, but said that the two 
airports will now compete with one another.
"Some additional supply will be created. We will only compete with other airlines," Schmidt said.
Ryanair expects to carry 250,000 passengers to and from Vilnius this year. It will offer daily flights to London, three 
flights per week to Dublin, Milan and Rome each, and two weekly flights to Barcelona. The Irish airline will operate a 
total of 25 routes from Vilnius and Kaunas.
Lithuanian Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis said in the same news conference that Ryanair's aircraft could bring 
some 120,000 additional tourists to Vilnius.
He predicted that low-cost carriers this year will hold a market share of about 27 percent in the Lithuanian capital.
"Vilnius Airport's goal is to have two low-fares airlines and thus increase passenger traffic. Following Wizz Air and 
Ryanair's expansion to Vilnius, we estimate that low-cost carriers would hold 27 percent of the flights market at 
Vilnius Airport in the summer of 2011," the minister said.

Ryanair expects that its Kaunas base will deliver a million passengers this year.
Masiulis said that Ryanair has not been given any breaks or financial aid for its expansion to Vilnius, because the 
EU's laws prohibit this.
Ryanair operates a fleet of 262 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with orders for another 49 new aircraft.

Ireland's Ryanair plans to launch flights from Vilnius
VILNIUS, Feb 21, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair intends to launch flights from Vilnius.
"We intend to report about routes from Vilnius. All other information will be disclosed at a news conference," 
Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis told BNS.
The news portal 15min.lt reports that Ryanair aims to establish its base in Vilnius and to launch flights from the 
Lithuanian capital.
More details about Ryanair's plans for Lithuania are expected to be disclosed at the news conference of Masiulis 
and Henrike Schmidt, Ryanair's marketing and sales director, in Vilnius at 3:30 p.m. on Monday.
According to the analysts, one of the main reasons for opening a base in Vilnius concerns a wish to compete with 
Hungary's budget carrier Wizz Air, which will open routes to eight destinations from Vilnius in April.
The sources of BNS denied that both Ryanair and Wizz Air would offer flights to the same destinations saying that 
only some of the routes might coincide.

Lithuania ranks 2nd in Europe by airport traffic growth in 2010
VILNIUS, Feb 17, BNS - Passenger traffic at Lithuania's airports rose by 23.7 percent in 2010, year-on-year, which 
was the second best result in Europe behind Russia, the air transport news website anna.aero reported after 
studying the data from 33 countries.
The fastest growth of 25.4 percent was registered in Russia. Latvia ranked fifth with the airport traffic growth of 14.7 
percent and Estonia was 27th with the increase of 2.9 percent.
Meanwhile, the airport of Kaunas, the second largest Lithuania's international airport, posted the steepest increase 
in passenger traffic, which soared by 1.7 times from 2009, among all European airports.
"The growth resulted on the opening of Ryanair's base," Jurate Baltrusaityte, the head of sales and marketing 
department at Kaunas Airport, which handled 809,700 passengers last year, told BNS.

Ryanair cancels flights from Riga to London, Milan, Liverpool, Dublin on Friday
RIGA, Feb 11, BNS - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair on Friday cancelled its flights from Riga international airport to 
London, Milan, Liverpool and Dublin, said airport's spokeswoman Sarmite Bunka-Briljonka.
In her words, Ryanair transferred its flights from London, Milan, Liverpool and Dublin, which had to land in Riga, to 
Kaunas in Lithuania, and therefore outgoing flights to these cities are cancelled.
The airport representative said that on Friday morning operations of the airport were not interfered due to the 
weather conditions, but with the blizzard becoming stronger, the runway of the airport was closed for 15 minutes to 
clean it. All other airplanes were waiting in the air for 15 minutes and landed at the airport after the snow was 
cleaned, but Ryanair decided to transfer its flights to Kaunas.
The 19 carriers currently working at Riga airport operate 82 direct routes from the Latvian capital.
Riga is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. The Riga International Airport is a fully state-owned company.

The airport is targeting an 11 percent rise in annual passenger numbers to over 900,000 this year.

VILNIUS, Feb 03, BNS - Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair in mid-April is launching flights between Lithuania's 
second-biggest city of Kaunas and the Greek islands of Kos and Rhodes.
Henrike Schmidt, the sales and marketing manager at Ryanair, said this at a news conference on Thursday.
Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas said at the same conference, "We are glad that Ryanair sees possibilities for 
expanding the geography of flights from Kaunas. These two routes are a good and clear message primarily to 
travelers from Lithuania."
Schmidt said that Ryanair plans to start flights to Rhodes on Apr. 12, and to Kos, on Apr. 16. The airline does not 
plan to operate these routes during the winter season.
Sliupas told reporters that Kaunas Airport is currently in talks with other airlines, including non-EU based, on new 
flight destinations.
However, the airport's CEO declined to elaborate. "We are working on this every day. Talks are our job," he said.
Ryanair's sales and marketing manager did not comment on whether the airline is in talks over new routes from 
Vilniaus and Palanga.
The Irish carrier established its first Central and Eastern European base in Kaunas last May. The airline currently 
has 44 bases and operates in 160 airports in 27 countries.

Election 2011. Kaunas: dissatisfaction with government may cut conservatives' advantage
KAUNAS, Feb 1, BNS - Caused by economic downturn, the dissatisfaction with the local and central government by 
Kaunas residents may cut the advantage of the conservatives, who hold the majority in the city council, during the 
upcoming local election, political experts say.
Having 17 out of 41 seats in Kaunas council, the conservatives say themselves they might get fewer votes than four 
years ago. But they hope to remain the ruling party in pro-conservative Kaunas.
It is estimated that the Order and Justice Party, whose supporters have been strengthened by a recent partial 
victory of the party's leader Rolandas Paksas in the European Court of Human Rights, might take a portion of votes 
from the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats. And certain "left-directed" tendencies might give 
additional votes to the social democrats.
"I believe the conservatives will loose a portion of voters' confidence, although the numbers shouldn't be dramatic. 
The social democrats and the Order and Justice Party have chances to strengthen their positions," Bernaras 
Ivanovas, an associated professor at Kaunas Magnus University, told BNS.
In his words, the dissatisfaction over heating prices is always related to those in power. Meanwhile, such 
accomplishments as the establishment of a Ryanair base in Kaunas have little effect on voters.
Kaunas Mayor Andrius Kupcinskas acknowledges the fact that the conservatives may get fewer mandates, but 
underlined that the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats remain clear leaders in most surveys.
"We are still leading in surveys. Of course, the economic downturn may adjust results and perhaps we won't get 
such a clear majority as in 2007," he told BNS, adding that the conservatives hope to get at least a quarter of 41 
seats.
Election 2011. Kaunas : dissatisfaction with government may cut conservatives' advantage
"Taking into account the fact that independent candidates are running in this election, the city council might be even 
more varied, but we hope to be part of the ruling majority and continue our planned work, even more so there are 
plenty of planned and ongoing work," the Kaunas mayor said.
Kupcinskas believes residents of Kaunas and other Lithuanian cities tend to differentiate between activities of local 
politicians and actions of the central government, but he also noted that the dissatisfaction over the government 
might "slightly" influence the Kaunas results.
Jurate Novagrockiene, a political scientist, said she believed people's dissatisfaction over the ruling conservatives 
might be beneficial for independent candidates.
"The dissatisfaction over the conservatives and the reluctance to vote for the leftists can lead to the situation when 
people would vote for the independents," she said.
Along party lists, coalitions "United Kaunas", "Different Lithuania", Stasys Zirgulis coalition of independent 
candidates and coalition "We - non-partisan returned emigrants" will run in the election.
In Novagrockiene's opinion, the factor of Rolandas Paksas, who had won a case in the European Court of Human 
Rights, might influence results in Kaunas as well, therefore, the Order and Justice Party might get more results 
here.
The social democrats have six representatives in Kaunas, the Order and Justice Party has four, followed by the 
liberalcentrists (3), the Liberals Movement, the Labor Party and the Young Lithuania (2 each) and the New Union 
(1).

Vilnius airport looks to attract one more budget airline this year - CEO
VILNIUS, Jan 14, BNS - Vilnius International Airport, the largest airport in Lithuania, this year is looking to attract 
one more major low-cost airline.
"This year we aim to attract one more large cheap flights carrier, which will further accelerate our passenger change 
dynamics, as the upcoming arrival of Wizz Air in April is quiet a serious market booster. We think that we should not 
stop at this point, but to press harder on the accelerator to achieve good growth dynamics," Vilnius Airport CEO 
Tomas told BNS on Friday.
BNS has unofficial information that talks are currently underway over flights from Vilnius with Ireland's budget airline 
Ryanair and the UK low-cost carrier EasyJet.
"Negotiations are being held continuously, and definitely not with a single company. They (the talks) are at different 
stages. We are at a very intensive stage (of talks) with several carriers," the airport's CEO said.
Vaisvila predicts that annual passenger traffic at Vilnius Airport will increase to 1.8 million this year, to 2.1 million 
next year and to 2.5 million in 2013 after rising by 5 percent to 1.37 million last year.
Hungary's budget carrier Wizz Air in April plans to launch flights from Vilnius to eight destinations. Also, the 
company will base one plane at the airport, making it its 14th flights base in Europe and the first one in the Baltic 
countries.

Lithuania to spend less on tourism promotion than Latvia, Estonia in 2011 - weekly
VILNIUS, Jan 10, BNS - Lithuania will spend about 8.6 million litas (EUR 2.5 mln) on tourism promotion this year. 
Latvia will spend 10.5 million litas for this purpose and Estonia has allocated more than 17 million litas to this year's 
budget of its tourism agency, the Veidas weekly reports on Monday.
The local authority of Vilnius hopes to stock up some 600,000 litas for marketing measures this year, same as in 
2010. Meanwhile, Latvia plans to allocate some 7.3 million litas (down from 10 million litas in 2010) for the Live 
Riga, a project of Riga's promotion abroad.
Lithuania still does not have a long-term tourism strategy, the weekly reports.
According to the study carried out by the Tourism Department, this is one of the reasons why Vilnius has only 19 
direct routes whereas Riga has as many as 107. Another reason was the lowering of airport fees implemented by 
Riga Airport back in 2004 and winning over of transit customers, who comprised the main flow now, Tadas Vizgirda, 
vice-president of Latvian air carrier Airbaltic and head of its Lithuanian office, told the weekly.
Lithuania's position will improve somewhat from April after the opening of eight routes from Vilnius by the budget 
carrier Wizz Air.
However, the Transport Ministry is concerned that the number of direct routes might decline again soon if the 
passenger flow is minor.
"Ryanair has not called off flights from Riga to Germany, which may be explained by the fact that Lithuania does not 
pay enough attention to the promotion of the country in those German cities. The flow of passengers from Latvia is 
stable since both the local authority of Riga and Latvia's tourism representative offices promote the country," 
Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis said.

According to the figures made available by the Economy Ministry, in 2009 tourism accounted for 7 percent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP) in Estonia, for 4 percent in Latvia and for 2.6 percent in Lithuania.

The number of flights rose by 45 percent to about 8,700 and the amount of cargo handled soared by 110 percent to

"The year 2010 was successful. We made the most of opportunities offered by the economic downturn," Arijandas

The airport's strategy to become a hub for cheap flights and transit cargo shipments, chosen back in 2005, has 
proved to work well, he added.

Ryanair currently offers 16 routes from Kaunas and Airbaltic operates a direct service to Riga. London remained the

Second aircraft hangar to be built in Kaunas Airport
VILNIUS, Jan 05, BNS - The airport of Kaunas, the second largest in Lithuania, will lease off an almost 48 ares land 
parcel for the construction of one more aircraft hangar worth about 3-5 million litas (EUR 0.87-1.45 mln).
The lease tender was announced on Wednesday.
Last year Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair leased a land parcel in Karmelava, the site of the airport, and built an 
aircraft maintenance hangar.
"Our priority activity concerns the expansion of the airport through the attraction of as many providers of 
maintenance services as possible. It makes the airport more attractive. Ryanair has built the hangar for its own 
needs but there are companies that would like to render those services to the third persons. We are very happy 
about it, we see the need on the market and, therefore, we have allocated a land parcel for this purpose," Arijandas 
Sliupas, the airport's CEO, told BNS.
He would not specify the companies interested in the lease of land at the airport. According to Sliupas, investments 
into the construction of the aircraft hangar could total some 3-5 million litas.
The land lease auction is planned to be held on Jan. 26. Land will be leased for a period of 40 years.
The aircraft maintenance hangar of Ryanair, which leased a land parcel of 27.5 ares for the facility, launched 
operations at the end of October last year.

VILNIUS, Dec 20, BNS - Late or cancelled flights disrupted air traffic at Vilnius International Airport, the largest in 
Lithuania, on Monday.
An Estonian Air flight to Stockholm from Vilnius has been cancelled. Some flights run behind the schedule.
"We do not have any problems due to weather conditions and we do not have any reports about any problems due

been notified officially of," Gabriele Vasiliauskaite, Vilnius Airport's spokeswoman, told BNS.

Bad air traffic to Brussels could affect Lithuania's EU chairmanship - politicians
VILNIUS, Dec 15, BNS - Bad air communication with Belgium and Luxembourg can become a serious problem 
after Lithuania takes over chairmanship over the European Union (EU) in the second half of 2013, Lithuanian 
politicians warned on Wednesday.
Diplomats of the Foreign Ministry had listed the issue among problems that could impede Lithuania's EU 
presidency.
"The communication will ruin all outbound trips," Dailis Barakauskas of the opposition Order and Justice Party said 
at a meeting of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee that addressed the country's readiness for EU 
chairmanship.
He noted that, according to the Foreign Ministry's plan, 150 meetings during the six months of presidency should 
take place in Lithuania, with another 3,000 held in Brussels and Luxembourg. The MP expressed fears that 
Lithuanian officials due to preside over the meetings would not be able to travel to the venues in time.
Foreign Vice-Minister Egidijus Meilunas confirmed that the ministry was raising the issue, adding that it could not do 
much.
"We are already signaling this but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot establish an air carrier company," said 
Meilunas.
The vice-minister maintained there have been cases when trips of Lithuanian officials to Brussels lasted 20 hours.
"We cannot allow a group chairman to spend 20 hours on a trip to Brussels," the diplomat added.
Bad air traffic to Brussels could affect Lithuania 's EU chairmanship - politicians
Currently, Brussels Airlines operate one daily flight from Vilnius to Brussels and back. Ryanair carrier has three 
weekly flights between Brussels and Lithuania's second-largest city Kaunas. Lithuania has no direct flights to 
Luxembourg.
Meilunas considered the possibility of approaching air companies with a proposal to open more routes between 
Brussels and Vilnius or Kaunas at least in the second half of 2013. In his words, air carriers should be interested in 
the proposition due to the high numbers of passengers.
After presenting Lithuania's readiness for EU presidency, the vice-minister spoke about plans to expand Lithuania's 
permanent mission to EU in Brussels to 113 diplomats. The Foreign Ministry has already set up a department for 
EU chairmanship.
A possibility is considered to shift a part of presidency events from Vilnius to other cities, for example, Kaunas, 
Klaipeda, Trakai or Druskininkai.
Lithuania has planned a tight budget for EU presidency. In Meilunas' words, the country will follow examples of 
Finland, Portugal and Slovenia that spent 62-75 million euros for the duties as EU chairman.

Number of flights cancelled at Riga airport due to bad weather
RIGA, Dec 10, BNS - Due to bad weather conditions, the Latvian national airline Airbaltic has on Friday cancelled 
several inbound and outbound flights at the Riga airport in the Latvian capital and the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair 
has decided that inbound flights to Riga will be diverted to the Kaunas airport in Lithuania which means that Ryanair 
flights scheduled to depart from Riga on Friday have also been cancelled, the Riga airport reported.
The airport's spokesman Martins Langrats told BNS that Airbaltic has cancelled outbound flights to Tallinn, 
Brussels, Oslo, Berlin, Stockholm and Copenhagen and diverted the Helsinki-Riga flight to Vilnius. The Airbaltic 
flight Tartu-Riga has been cancelled as well because the Tartu airport in Estonia also is closed.
Ryanair flights from Duesseldorf, Milano (Bergamo), Liverpool and London (Stansted) to Riga have been diverted to 
Kaunas and so far there is no certainty about the flight from Dublin. Langrats said that it meant that all Ryanair 
flights outbound from Riga had been cancelled.
He said that snowing had stopped at the Riga airport around noon but strong side-wind was a problem.
With 18 airlines serving 82 direct destinations, the Riga International Airport is the largest hub in the Baltics.
It has been snowing heavily in Latvia since Thursday.

Estonia: Swissotel Tallinn boosts room occupancy rate by 15 percent
TALLINN, Nov 11, BNS - The room occupancy rate of Swissôtel Tallinn improved by around 15 percent in the first 
three quarters of this year compared to the same period a year ago.
Continued improvement is on the cards, the director general of the hotel, Bart Westerhout, told BNS in an interview. 
"I believe everybody had a great summer and hotels and restaurants have managed to create a financial buffer. 
Had the summer been awful, many businesses would have found themselves in difficulty," he said.
In his words, small privately-owned hotels are finding it hard to operate at present. "I hope they will be able to stay 
in business," he said.
Swissotel Tallinn entered the market at the end of 2007 which Westerhout said was a very difficult time: on the one 
hand, the economic situation was deteriorating, on the other, there were already too many hotels in Tallinn.
The way Westerhout sees it, there are at present too many one- to five-star hotels in the Estonian capital which 
affects both occupancy rates and prices. "We find ourselves in a buyer's market, customers have too much 
influence on prices," he said.
Operating costs of Tallinn hotels do not differ all that much from those of other European hotels except for lower 
labor costs. Westerhout said one has to pay more for energy in Tallinn than elsewhere in Europe.
"Comparing the price level of Tallinn hotels with those in Riga, in Riga hotel prices have always been 20 percent 
higher," Westerhout observed. But the changeover to the single euro currency will have a positive effect and 
improve Estonia's position in comparison with Latvia and Lithuania, he said.
Estonia : Swissotel Tallinn boosts room occupancy rate by 15 percent
The hotel manager said he hopes that no new large hotels will enter the market in the next three to four years. New 
hotels could come when occupancy rates of the existing ones reach 75 percent, he explained. In Westerhout's 
view, Tallinn needs a place where international conferences and fairs with 1,500-2,000 participants could be held.
New flights of the low-cost airline Ryanair are a very good initiative, Westerhout said. The new services will in his 
opinion bring to Tallinn not only vacationists but also many business travelers for whom direct flights are very 
important so as to save time. This will be grist to the mill for Swisshotel Tallinn and other hotels oriented towards 
businesspeople. Westerhout said he hopes more new flights out of Tallinn will be launched.
Selling the Estonian capital as a destination requires three times the effort necessary for say Budapest, Prague or 
Munich, Westerhout said. Ninety customers out of one hundred experience a positive surprise when in Tallinn: 
"Everybody speaks English, stores are open seven days a week," he explained. All that combined with the 
nearness of the airport, the medieval Old Town and the art museum Kumu makes Tallinn a perfect weekend 
destination, he added.

Political decision needed for setting up Ryanair hub in Riga - Riga airport CEO
RIGA, Nov 03, BNS - Irish low-costs airline Ryanair is still eager to set up a hub in Riga, but the plan would require 
a political decision from Latvia, said Krisjanis Peters, CEO of the international airport of Riga.
The head of Riga airport indicated that Ryanair would open its hub in Riga as soon as the airport gave the green 
light.
Peters said his intention was not to free the Ryanair management from responsibility, but that the setting up of the 
hub in Riga was more a political issue, because it would be necessary to assess the overall economic gains from 
the project, not only the financial benefits of Riga airport. Peters also pointed out that the direct financial 
implications for Riga airport would not be positive, if it accepted the terms proposed by Ryanair.
The Riga airport CEO said that negotiations with Ryanair were ongoing and the Irish company had gradually 
improved its proposals. The Irish no-frills carrier is still strongly interested in setting up the hub in Riga, he said.
"The business model and attitude of Ryanair, obviously reflecting their corporate culture, is that we should be happy 
that they are in Riga in the first place," said Peters, adding that Ryanair was currently leaving a South Korean 
airport, as the company was warmly welcomed in crisis-hit regions that offered such incentives as rent-free offices.
Peters also noted that Ryanair's business in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, for instance, was backed both by the 
local and central government. "We have a rough idea of the good or even fantastic terms on which Ryanair is 
currently operating in Kaunas. We, of course, can only dream about it, but what we are seeing in Kaunas is direct 
support and understanding of the local and central government. I think, however, that the direct financial gains of 
Kaunas airport will be insignificant, to say the least," said Peters.
Political decision needed for setting up Ryanair hub in Riga - Riga airport CEO
Ryanair's plans to set up a hub in Riga were made public in the summer of 2006, but the plan still has not 
materialized despite the ongoing talks. In May 2010, Ryanair opened a hub in Kaunas.
Ryanair, which started operations in Latvia in October 2004, offers 14 direct routes from Riga.
Riga, largest airport in the Baltics by passenger numbers, served 60 aircraft, 4.1 million air passengers and 9,400 
tons of cargo in 2009. Compared to 2008, the number of aircraft grew by 5 percent and passenger turnover by 10.2 
percent.
At present, 18 airlines are operating 82 direct routes from Riga airport.

Hungary's Wizz Air signs deal with Vilnius airport - media
VILNIUS, Oct 25, BNS - Hungary's budget carrier Wizz Air is expected to launch flights from Vilnius next April, the 
Lrytas.lt Internet news site reported on Monday.
Wizz Air on Friday signed a partnership agreement with Vilnius International Airport. The airline is to offer flights to 
eight European destinations, it wrote.
The airport has not commented on the news yet.
Lrytas.lt quoted its sources as saying that the Hungarian airline will not offer strong competition to other carriers 
operating from Vilnius.
Meanwhile, the airport's talks with another low-fare airline, Ireland's Ryanair, have run aground. Plans for flights to 
Vilnius and the opening of a base at the airport have fallen through because the Irish wanted too favorable terms 
that would have caused dissatisfaction among other airlines.
With Lithuanian-owned Star1 Airlines having gone bankrupt, 17 destinations are currently served from Vilnius 
Airport.

Klaas said that the issue of the travel center would become more important in connection with the opening of new 
air routes. He said that on the basis of the same logic it was necessary to develop also the Tartu, Kuressaare and 
Kardla airports.
The Economic Committee said that as air links made up a significant part of the Estonian business environment 
then it should be possible to fly from Tallinn to all the most important European business centers and return during 
one day.
The Economic Committee expressed its support to the route subsidies program initiated by Tallinn Airport, which 
will make Tallinn Airport more competitive compared with the closest rivals. Klaas said that the 65 million kroons 
(EUR 4.1 mln)  planned as cover of the Tallinn Airport security expenditures, which will make it possible for airlines 
to offer more favorable airport fees.
Klaas underlined as an aim also the need to turn Tallinn Airport into a center of  North Europe's Asian-bound flights 
as Tallinn, the closest capital of a European Union member country to China, has a favorable location and 
developed infrastructure for this.
Tallinn airport needs bus links with  different regions of Estonia - MP
Board chairman of Tallinn Airport Rein Loik said in the Economic Committee  that Tallinn Airport had held talks with 
two Chinese airlines.
Besides, Loik added that the low-cost airline Ryanair would launch flights from Tallinn, providing direct flights to 
Stockholm, Oslo, Dusseldorf, Dublin, Edinburgh, Milan and London from  December 13. From January Blue 1 will 
start operating, flying to Helsinki and from April Easyjet will start flying in addition to London also to Liverpool.

Hungary's Wizz Air may launch flights from Vilnius soon - daily
VILNIUS, Oct 15, BNS - Hungary's budget carrier Wizz Air is likely to launch flights from Vilnius this winter season 
and Ireland's Ryanair is in talks to begin flights from the Lithuanian capital as well, the business daily Verslo Zinios 
reported on Friday.
Vilnius International Airport has confirmed being in talks with a new airline, but has not disclosed its name.
"Yes, the talks have been underway for quite a long time now. They are talking about setting up a base," Verslo 
Zinios quoted Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis as saying.
"One of the conditions is their commitment to a long-term presence at the airport. Such things must be written down 
in the contracts," he said.
According to the paper, Wizz Air intends to serve seven destinations from Vilnius with one plane. London could be 
one of the destinations.
This would mark the Hungarian airline's return to Lithuania. Wizz Air launched flights from Kaunas to Warsaw and 
on to other destinations in December 2005, shortly after announcing new hubs in Warsaw and Gdansk, but ended 
those flights in September 2006.
Wizz Air currently operates on around 150 routes from 13 bases across Central and Eastern Europe. It holds a 5.65 
percent share of Europe's low-fare flights market.
Ryanair, which has a base in Kaunas, makes no secret of its intentions to fly from Vilnius too, but it wants lower 
fees.

Ryanair to move part of planes to Kaunas after Marseille closure
(adds comment in para 3)
VILNIUS, Oct 14, BNS - Ireland's low-cost carrier Ryanair next year plans to move part of its French-based aircraft 
to Kaunas after closing its base at Marseille Airport.
The airline said it is yet to decide how many planes and jobs will be moved to Lithuania.
"No firm plan yet, but we are working to develop tourism further in Lithuania and in the Baltic countries," the airline's 
representative, Laszlo Tamas, told BNS.
Ryanair said in a statement that the four Marseille based aircraft and 200 jobs will be moved in January to airports 
in Spain, Italy and Lithuania.
It cited a dispute with French authorities over how its workers are paid as the main reason for closing its only 
French base at Marseille Airport.
The Irish carrier established its first Central and Eastern European base in Lithuania's second-biggest city of 
Kaunas last May.

Vilnius airport in talks with foreign airline over new hub - daily
VILNIUS, Oct 13, BNS - With Lithuania's privately-owned regular flights operator Star1 Airlines having gone bust, 
Vilnius International Airport is holding talks with an unnamed foreign airline on the opening of a hub in the 
Lithuanian capital, the daily Lietuvos Zinios reported on Wednesday.
Vilnius Airport does not deny being in talks, but gives no details.
"Yes, the airport is negotiating with a potential air carrier that could set up its base here. We prefer not to disclose 
any further details, because that could affect the talks," the paper quoted Gabriele Vasiliauskaite, the airport's 
spokeswoman, as saying.
According to Lietuvos Zinios, the airport is in talks with a small foreign-registered airline that has experience in the 
regular flights business. It is believed that the company would initially base several aircraft at the airport.
"I do not rule out the possibility that the results of the negotiations will be announced to the public by the end of this 
month and that the foreign-owned air carrier will launch operations in the (Lithuanian) capital as soon as next year," 
Algirdas Sakalys, the prime minister's advisor on transport issues, told the paper.
Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair earlier this year opened a new hub at Kaunas Airport.

TALLINN, Oct 13, BNS - The average room occupancy rate at Radisson Blu Hotel Olumpia in the first nine months

of customers has increased substantially this year. This holds true especially for guests from the neighboring 
countries Finland and Russia.
The average price of a hotel room has decreased compared with 2009, Makejev said.
"The final months of this year should be comparable with last year," he said, adding that an increase in the number 
of visitors is expected next year in connection with Ryanair's flying to Estonia and Tallinn becoming the European 
capital of culture.

Latvia's Airbaltic carrier to be charged advance payment or denied services at Riga airport
(expands)
RIGA, Oct 07, BNS - As of Friday, Oct. 8, Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier will be charged advanced payment or 
denied services at the international airport of Riga, since the airline has rejected a settlement agreement offered by 
Riga airport, the airport's spokesman Martins Langrats told BNS.
The Riga airport spokesman said that Airbaltic had been told to pay in advance for the airport's services by Friday 
noon, or else the airport would stop providing services to the airline from 4 p.m. Friday.
Langrats said that Riga airport would also update its lawsuit against Airbaltic whose debts to the airport exceeded 
five million lats already (EUR 7.1 mln).
The airport's spokesman explained that Airbaltic planes would still be allowed to land at and take off from Riga 
airport, but that the airport would no longer provide ramp services to Airbaltic aircraft. "Practically it means that the 
planes will not be flying," Langrats said.
The spokesman said that the airport expected Airbaltic to settle the advance payments, not all of its five million lats 
debt, by Friday noon. Langrats did not reveal the sum Airbaltic had to pay per day for the airport's services.
The representative of Riga airport indicated that the advance payment requirement was an unprecedented measure 
that had been prompted by the airline's refusal to pay for the services received from Riga airport and its negative 
credit history in relation to its major business partner, Riga airport.
Latvia 's Airbaltic carrier to be charged advance payment or denied services at Riga airport
In the spokesman's words, Riga airport has the right to terminate its contract with Airbaltic without previous notice if 
the airline delays its payments for more than two months. If Airbaltic avoids its obligations and refuses to pay the 
airport in advance Riga airport will have the right to stop providing services to the airline.
Airbaltic vice-president for corporate communications Janis Vanags told BNS that it had been Airbaltic's initiative to 
switch to advance payments for the airport's services and that the carrier had hired an independent auditor to 
assess the tariffs set by Riga airport.
"It was Airbaltic's proposal to Riga airport to switch to advance payments and hire an independent auditor to assess 
the tariffs impartially in order to ensure that all carriers are charged the same tariffs and prevent discriminatory 
competition terms," the Airbaltic representative said.
Vanags said Airbaltic found it unacceptable that as a Latvian airline it was charged higher fees at Riga airport than 
Ireland's low-costs carrier Ryanair. "Ensuring low costs for passengers is Airbaltic's priority. It is unacceptable that 
the Latvian airline and thus also its passengers are paying much higher fees for the services of Riga airport than a 
foreign company," he said.
Ilze Eida, a spokeswoman for the Latvian Transport Ministry, told BNS that the ministry was informed about the 
decision of Riga airport to charge advance payment from Airbaltic as of Oct. 8. In her words, the airport was forced 
to take this decision because of Airbaltic's refusal to clinch the settlement agreement.
If the two parties fail to reach the settlement agreement, their dispute will have to be resolved in court, the ministry 
representative said.
The representative of the Transport Ministry also pointed out that the Airbaltic board had not done everything to 
reach the out-of-court settlement and that if this leads to losses for the carrier, the Latvian state, as a shareholder, 
will take action against the company's board.
Previously the Riga airport filed a claim with the court against Airbaltic national carrier, seeking collection of a debt 
of 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.8 mln) that the airline had accumulated under various commercial contracts with the 
airport since the end of 2009.
Airbaltic in its turn filed with the court a claim against Riga International Airport for six million lats, claiming that the 
airport has been charging discriminatory tariffs from the national carrier.
The 17 airlines operating at Riga airport fly passengers on direct routes to 81 destinations. Riga is the biggest air 
traffic hub in the Baltic states.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares and Baltijas Aviacijas 
Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent that previously belonged to the Scandinavian 
airline SAS. The sole owner of BAS is Airbaltic CEO Bertolt Flick.

Ryanair to launch flights out of Estonian capital on Dec. 13
(expands)
TALLINN, Sep 30, BNS - The low-cost airline Ryanair will start flights out of Tallinn on Dec. 13, sales and marketing 
manager Laszlo Tamas said at a news conference in Tallinn on Thursday.
He named Oslo Rygge, Stockholm Skavsta, Dublin, Edinburgh, London Luton, Duesseldorf Weeze and Milan 
Bergamo as destinations.
Flights to Oslo, Stockholm and Duesseldorf are scheduled to begin on Dec. 13, to Dublin on Dec. 14, to Milan on 
Dec. 16, and to London and Edinburgh on Jan. 10. Ryanair has bases at all the above-mentioned destinations.
Sale of tickets will start on the website of the carrier on Oct. 1.
Ryanair expects to carry 300,000 passengers annually on the said routes.
Tamas said the new services should help create 300 new jobs in Estonia in both the hotel and the restaurant 
business. The tourists arriving by Ryanair are expected to leave around 50 million euros in Estonia annually, he 
observed.
If Ryanair does well in Tallinn during the first six months new destinations can be expected, he added.
One of the main reasons why Ryanair decided to come to Tallinn was the favorable terms offered to companies 
launching new flights by the local airport operator, Tallinna Lennujaam, Tamas said.
Tallinna Lennujaam CEO Rein Loik told BNS that easy terms will be in effect for five years. The airport charges of a 
carrier opening new routes will be 75 percent lower than usual and passenger-related expenses will be 
approximately 50 percent lower.

Loik added that if at present an airline has to pay the airport 10 euros per passenger the fee will come down to 
seven euros from  the new year. The airport operator last lowered fees in April.
Tallinna Lennujaam is working with many airlines to bring new flights to Tallinn, Loik said and voiced the hope that 
the new flight support program will make Tallinn attractive to carriers.
Ryanair expects to carry 73.5 million passengers on international flights this year. Its passenger numbers totaled 65 
million in 2009.
The no-frills carrier that is flying to 14 destinations from the Latvian capital Riga served 850,000 passengers there 
last year. This year's forecast is 900,000-950,000.
The flights the carrier operates out of Lithuania's second-largest city Kaunas number 19. This year's passenger 
numbers there are expected to exceed one million. Ryanair has a base in Kaunas.

Ryanair to start flights from Tallinn to seven destinations in December - paper
TALLINN, Sep 30, BNS - The low-cost airline Ryanair will start flying from Tallinn to seven destinations in 
December, the daily Eesti Paevaleht says.
The long negotiations have according to the paper's information reached the final stretch and official confirmation is

Estonian government has decided to allocate 65 million kroons (EUR 4.15 mln) to the operator of the airport, 
Tallinna Lennujaam.
The destinations that Ryanair will be offering are not known. Earlier for example London, Milan, Duesseldorf, 
Madrid, Kaunas, Oslo and Stockholm have been named.
Estonia is at present the only Baltic state to which Ryanair does not fly.

Latvian natl airline Airbaltic cancels flight to Brussels due to strike of air traffic controllers in Belgium
RIGA, Sep. 28, BNS - The Latvian national airline Airbaltic on Tuesday cancelled the Riga-Brussels flight because 
of the strike of air traffic controllers in Belgium, the airline said on its website.
Airbaltic has cancelled the 17.15 flight Riga-Brussels, which means that the Brussels-Riga flight scheduled to arrive 
in Riga at 10.35 p.m. on Tuesday night has also been cancelled.
Flights between Riga and Brussels are offered by Airbaltic and the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, which flies from 
Riga to Brussels (Charleroi) on Monday and Friday, therefore the strike of the Belgian air traffic controllers will not 
affect the Ryanair flights on this route.
The Belgian air traffic controllers began a 24-hour strike at 3 p.m. Latvian time on Tuesday.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares, and Baltijas 
Aviacijas Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent that previously belonged to the

Kaunas airport to open regular cargo route to Shanghai
(updates, expands)
VILNIUS, Sep 20, BNS - A new regular air cargo route linking Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas and the 
Chinese city of Shanghai is being launched at Kaunas International Airport. It will be the first service in the Baltic 
countries to handle transit cargoes to Western Europe.
Hoptrans Logistic will operate the service, which will be the first air cargo route of this scale in the Eastern and 
Central European region, the Lithuanian Transport Ministry said on Monday.
An IL-96 freighter is due to make its first landing at Kaunas Airport on Tuesday.
Lithuanian Transport Minister Eligijus Masiulis, as well as Vytas Volkevicius, the chairman of Hoptrans Logistic, and 
Martynas Smitas, the company's managing director, are to participate in the ceremony of launching the new 
service.
According to information from Kaunas Airport, Hoptrans Logistic is the only cargo handling company at the airport. 
However, all cargoes from Kaunas now go to Russia and other countries to the east of Lithuania. All western-bound 
cargoes are flown mostly to Hamburg, Frankfurt and other major Western European hubs, bypassing the Baltic 
countries.
Kaunas Airport said in August that it handled 2,500 tons of transit cargo during the first seven months of this year, 
which was 17 percent more than in the full year 2009. The transit cargo traffic in July reached this year's record 
high of 472 tons.
The US-based parcel service provider UPS and the Dutch express and mail services provider TNT also operate at 
the airport, each shipping an average of 124 tons of cargo through the airport monthly.

Latvian daily press digest for business news on Wednesday, August 18
RIGA, Aug 18, BNS - The following is the Latvian daily press digest for business news on Wednesday, August 17.

EUR 71,000 BAIL TO BE COLLECTED FOR RELEASE OF LATVENERGO EX-CEO. The Riga Center District 
Court decided on Tuesday to release Karlis Mikelsons, the former CEO of Latvia's Latvenergo power utility, who is 
being kept in custody on suspicions of corruption, on a 50,000 lats (EUR 71,000) bail. The bail must be paid within 
one month's time. Mikelsons' lawyer Egons Rusanovs did not have information whether Mikelsons' family had such 
money and said he was not authorized to talk about it.
Mikelsons' wife is determined to collect the money as soon as possible. "The money must be collected, and we will 
try to collect it as soon as possible," Mikelsons' wife Laila Mikelsone told BNS. She said the support of Mikelsons' 
friends would play an important role, because Mikelsons only owned one apartment. On Tuesday, when the court 
decided to change the supervision measure for Mikelsons, his friends and family had gathered by the courthouse. 
His wife told the press that the criminal proceedings against Mikelsons were part of the pre-election campaign. She 
said it was evidenced by the fact that Economics Minister Artis Kampars (New Era party) had announced that 
Mikelsons could not return to the post of Latvenergo CEO even if he was acquitted.

Earlier the Riga airport filed a claim with the court against Airbaltic, seeking collection of a debt of 2.5 million lats. 
When the airline failed to pay the debt, the airport increased its claim to 3.4 million lats. Airbaltic, meanwhile, turned 
to the Competition Council regarding unequal tariffs, which the carrier said were higher for Airbaltic than for the Irish 
low-cost airline Ryanair.

PARTICIPANTS OF 2ND PILLAR PENSION SCHEME HAVE SAVED EUR 1,000 EACH. Each participant of the 
2nd level pension scheme in Latvia has currently saved about 692 lats, which they will be able to use upon 
retirement, said Harijs Svarcs, an investment expert with Latvia's Swedbank. The number of participants in the 2nd 
pillar pension scheme is currently 1,114,996, and their average age is 37 years, meaning that they still have 28 
years to go before retirement. Svarcs said that in 2008 contributions to the 2nd pillar pensions were 8 percent 
compared to only 2 percent at the moment, meaning that people make 75 percent smaller savings for their 2nd 
pillar pensions and those pensions will be 75 pct smaller.

LATVENERGO HOLDS COMPETITION. The state-owned Latvian electricity utility Latvenergo on Tuesday 
announced a competition to fill the vacant position of the board chairman and a board member. Eligible candidates 
to Latvenergo board chairman should have a Master's degree in business administration, economics, financial 
management or engineering sciences and at least five years of experience in management of large companies 
employing 500 people, as well as understanding of the processes in the energy industry.

VAT HIKES TO KILL BOOK PUBLISHERS. At the moment, a 10 percent VAT rate is applied to books in Latvia, but 
there are constant proposals to lift the reduced rate and apply the regular 21 percent VAT on books as well. This 
would essentially force most book publishers out of business. The issue of revising VAT rates for a number of 
goods and services, including books, is currently on the agenda of ministry state secretaries.
Finance Ministry experts estimate that by lifting the reduced VAT rates another 95 million lats would be collected to 
the state budget. Book publishers have pointed out that the actual result of this move would be the destruction of 
the book-publishing sector in Latvia.

Riga airport might revise ground service fees for Airbaltic if the carrier serves 3 mln passengers per year
(expands)
RIGA, Aug 17, BNS - The Riga International Airport might revise its ground service fees for Latvia's national airline 
Airbaltic if the carrier at the Riga airport in the future served at least three million passengers per year, Riga airport 
board member Janis Kuzulis told the press Tuesday.
"If Airbaltic reaches three million [served] passengers within one year, namely, this year, then we can grant better 
servicing conditions to Airbaltic," he said.
Kuzulis said the airline and the airport had drafted a memorandum of understanding on solving the dispute between 
the two companies outside the court. He said a conceptual agreement had been signed and the memorandum itself 
was still in progress, therefore specific deadlines for Airbaltic to pay its debt to the airport had not been set so far.
"The relationship between the airline and the airport will always be complicated, because one party wants to receive 
more and the other party wants to pay less. It is a circle we can never avoid. But for now we have reached a 
conceptual agreement that Airbaltic will pay for the services provided by the Riga airport, namely, pay back the 
debt. Meanwhile, the Riga airport has agreed to offer lower fees for its services to Airbaltic if the airline continues 
expansion in the Riga airport," Kuzulis said, adding that if the airline expanded its operations and served more 
passengers, the airport could offer lower fees because its costs would decline as the number of passengers 
increased.
Kuzulis rejected the possibility of litigation. He said that neither Airbaltic nor the Riga airport saw the relationship 
between the two companies in the past few weeks as normal. "We wish to cooperate, we do not want to engage in 
public quarrels, we do not seek mutual insults. What both parties want and what I personally believe is absolutely 
Riga airport might revise ground service fees for Airbaltic if the carrier serves 3 mln passengers per year
correct, is to work together and ensure the development of both companies and aviation in Latvia. Today I was 
convinced that Airbaltic has the same approach," he said.
But the Riga airport board member does not agree with the claims published in the media that the airport was 
applying discriminating tariffs, which differed for Airbaltic and Irish low-fares airline Ryanair. Kuzulis explained that 
all airlines were paying equal fees for the airport for the centralized infrastructure and aircraft landing and takeoff in 
line with Cabinet of Ministers regulations. The only fees that differ are for the aircraft servicing. "We can negotiate 
with Airbaltic on reducing these ground service fees if the airline reaches certain volumes," Kuzulis said.
Airbaltic and the Riga International Airport on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding about ending the 
litigation between them and further cooperation.
On Aug. 11 the Riga airport filed a claim with the court against Airbaltic national carrier, seeking collection of a debt 
of 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.8 mln) that the airline had accumulated under various commercial contracts with the 
airport since the end of 2009.
Airbaltic in its turn filed with the court a claim against Riga International Airport for six million lats, claiming that the 
airport has been charging discriminatory tariffs from the national carrier.
The 17 airlines operating at Riga airport fly passengers on direct routes to 81 destinations. Riga is the biggest air 
traffic hub in the Baltic states.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares and Baltijas Aviacijas 
Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent that previously belonged to the Scandinavian 
airline SAS. The sole owner of BAS is Airbaltic CEO Bertolt Flick.

Court opens case over nearly EUR 8.5 mln claim against Riga airport
RIGA, Aug 13, BNS - Riga Regional Court on Friday opened a case over a nearly six million lats (EUR 8.5 mln) 
claim Latvian national carrier Airbaltic has filed against the international airport of Riga, the court's representative 
Ivars Tomsons told BNS.
The court representative, however, declined to elaborate on the case.
Airbaltic filed its lawsuit in late July, claiming that the tariffs set by the airport were discriminatory to the national 
airline.
Riga airport changed its tariffs last November, but Ireland's low-costs airline Ryanair still continues to pay its fees to 
the airport in accordance with the old tariffs. According to information at Airbaltic's disposal, Ryanair is paying to 
Riga airport 4.5 euros per passenger, a price that includes the landing fee, the ground services fee and the airport 
duty. For Airbaltic, the tariffs have been raised by 60 percent at Riga airport, and the airline's total expenses, 
including the landing fee, the ground services fee and the airport duty, reach nearly 10 euros per passenger.
Riga airport has filed an updated lawsuit with Riga Regional Court claiming a 3.4 million lats debt from Airbaltic.
The 17 airlines operating at Riga airport fly passengers on direct routes to 81 destinations. Riga is the biggest air 
traffic hub in the Baltic states.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on

Latvian transport minister orders Airbaltic national carrier, Riga airport to agree debt repayment
(adds comments by Airbaltic CEO)
RIGA, Aug 12, BNS - Latvian Transport Minister Kaspars Gerhards has ordered the international airport of Riga and 
Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier to resolve their financial dispute by next Monday, August 16, expressing a clear 
position that the airline must repay its debts to the airport already in the next few days, the ministry's representative 
Ilze Eida told BNS.
The ministry representative also pointed out that Airbaltic shareholders have been engaged in intensive talks in 
recent days on the airline's debt to Riga airport, with the Transport Ministry expressing the position that the airline 
must first of all repay its debt to the airport already in the next few days, and secondly, that the issue of Airbaltic's 
debt must be solved separately from the airline's discrimination claims against the airport.
The Transport Ministry has also said that if a constructive solution is found, the lawsuit Riga airport has filed against 
Airbaltic can be withdrawn at any time. Gerhards is set to visit both companies next Monday to listen to their 
representatives and their solutions.
Airbaltic CEO Bertolt Flick was very brief in his statement for the press. "We will pay a fair fee to the Riga airport, 
but not larger than the amount they charge from [the Irish low-cost airline] Ryanair," he said.
Riga airport on Wednesday filed an update to its lawsuit against Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier, raising the claim 
to 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.8 mln).
In its initial lawsuit Riga airport claimed more than 2.5 million lats from Airbaltic. The airport's representative 
explained that since July 19 when the airport filed its lawsuit over Airbaltic's debts, the national carrier has not made 
a single payment, thus increasing its debt to the airport from more than 2.5 million lats to 3.4 lats.

Riga airport to increase its claim against Latvia's Airbaltic carrier
RIGA, Aug 11, BNS - The international airport of Riga is planning to file on Wednesday a supplement to its lawsuit 
against Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier that would raise the claim to 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.8 mln), the airport's 
representative Santa Auguste told BNS.
In its initial lawsuit Riga airport claimed more than 2.5 million lats from Airbaltic. The representative explained that 
since July 19 when the airport filed its lawsuit over Airbaltic's debts, the national carrier has not made a single 
payment, thus increasing its debt to the airport from more than 2.5 million lats to 3.4 lats.
"Airbaltic's debts to the international airport of Riga have been accumulating since the end of 2009," she said.
Riga airport has also asked the court to impound the payments Airbaltic receives from third parties, as well as to 
freeze its bank accounts and money that is kept with other financial institutions. At the same time, the airport's 
representatives admitted that the lawsuit was an unpleasant and extraordinary measure that was being taken to 
defend the interests of the company and its shareholder -- the Latvian state.
"Talks on the repayment of the debts have been a complicated process, and Airbaltic has been breaching all the 
agreements," Auguste said.
Airbaltic president and CEO Bertold Flick told BNS that the airline would not accept the disciminatory treatment on 
the part of Riga airport. "We support equal competition conditions at the airport for all airlines. Since last November 
the international airport of Riga has repeatedly increase its fees for Airbaltic to cover the losses incurred from the 
contract with [Ireland's low-costs airline] Ryanair," Flick said.
The Airbaltic president added he found it absurd that a party state-owned company was paying to the airport twice 
as much as the Irish company, but that so far negotiations with the transport minister and the airport's 
administration had ended without any results.
Riga airport to increase its claim against Latvia 's Airbaltic carrier
Flick also noted that Airbaltic has already complained to the Competition Council about this and also filed a lawsuit, 
claiming that its actual losses amounted to seven million lats.
In Flick's words, Airbaltic together with the Latvian Transport Ministry was currently looking for a solution to the 
situation to end the discrimination of the Latvian carrier. "We are surprised that, instead of seeking a constructive 
solution, the international airport of Riga is using the tactics of intimidation."
The Latvian national airline Airbaltic has filed with the court a claim against Riga International Airport for six million 
lats.
Airbaltic wants to claim six million lats from the Riga airport over unequal tariffs for different airlines. The company 
said the airport's tariffs had changed on Nov. 1, 2009, but Ireland's low-fares airline Ryanair was still making 
payments in line with the old tariffs. According to the information available to Airbaltic, Ryanair is paying the Riga 
airport 4.5 euros per passenger, including the aircraft landing fees, ground handling and airport fees. Airbaltic said 
the Riga airport on Jan. 1, 2010, raised ground-handling tariffs for Airbaltic by 60 percent. Besides, the airport also 
introduced infrastructure fees for ground handling, increasing the company's overall expenditures to almost 10 
euros per passenger.
Meanwhile, the Riga International Airport has filed a claim against the Airbaltic for collection of a debt totaling more 
than 2.5 million lats. The airport will also ask the court to secure the claim by imposing a lien on the payments due 
to Airbaltic from third parties and the airline's money held by banks and other financial institutions. The airport said 
that Airbaltic had accumulated the debt since late 2009 under various commercial contracts with the Riga airport 
and the total debt now topped 2.5 million lats.

Riga airport to increase amount of claim against Latvian natl airline Airbaltic to EUR 4.8 mln
RIGA, Aug 11, BNS - The Riga International Airport on Wednesday intends to submit to the Riga Regional Court an 
updated claim against the Latvian national airline Airbaltic in which the amount of the debt that the airport seeks to 
collect from the airline has been increased to 3.4 million lats (EUR 4.84 mln), airport's spokeswoman Santa 
Auguste told BNS.
Previously the Riga airport had filed a claim against Airbaltic over a debt of 2.5 million lats. Auguste explained that 
Airbaltic had failed to make any payments to the airport since July 19 when it failed the first claim with the court, 
therefore the amount of the debt has increased from more than 2.5 million lats to 3.4 million lats.
"Airbaltic debts under various commercial agreements with the Riga International Airport have been accumulating 
since late 2009," she said.
The airport has also asked the court to secure the claim by imposing a lien on the payments due to Airbaltic from 
third parties and the airline's money held by banks and other financial institutions. But the airport's representatives 
said also that taking the matter to the court was an unpleasant and extreme measure to defend the interests of the 
company and its shareholder, the Latvian state.
"The talks about payment of the liabilities have been a very complicated process, and any agreements reached 
have been breached by Airbaltic," Auguste said.
Meanwhile, Airbaltic has also filed a claim with the Riga Regional, seeking six million lats from the Riga airport over 
unequal tariffs for different airlines. The airline said the airport's tariffs had changed on Nov. 1, 2009, but Ireland's 
low-fares airline Ryanair was still making payments in line with the old tariffs. According to the information available 
to Airbaltic, Ryanair is paying the Riga airport 4.5 euros per passenger, including the aircraft landing fees, ground 
Riga airport to increase amount of claim against Latvian natl airline Airbaltic to EUR 4.8 mln

Latvian natl airline Airbaltic takes Riga airport to court, claims EUR 8.5 mln
RIGA, Jul 20, BNS - The Latvian national airline Airbaltic on Tuesday filed with the court a claim against Riga 
International Airport for six million lats (EUR 8.54 mln), Janis Vanags, a spokesman for the airline, told BNS.
Earlier on Tuesday Airbaltic was waiting for the airport to submit proposals on how to solve the situation where 
Airbaltic must pay twice as much for servicing passengers as the Irish low-fares airline Ryanair. The initial deadline 
was at noon but the airport requested an extension till 2 p.m. and was granted it. When the time was past the 
second deadline and Airbaltic still had not received any proposals from the airport, the airline took the case to the 
court.
Airbaltic wants to claim six million lats from the Riga airport over unequal tariffs for different airlines. The company 
said the airport's tariffs had changed on Nov. 1, 2009, but Ireland's low-fares airline Ryanair was still making

Airbaltic awaits proposals from Riga airport on how to ensure equal competition
(adds comment by Riga airport in para. 4)
RIGA, Jul 20, BNS - Latvian national airline Airbaltic expects the Riga International Airport to give proposals on 
Tuesday on how to solve the situation where Airbaltic must pay twice as much for servicing passengers as the Irish 
low-fares airline Ryanair, Airbaltic President and CEO Bertolt Flick said in a press statement.
If Airbaltic fails to receive proposals from the Riga airport on how to ensure equal competition for all airlines, the 
airline will file a claim against the airport for collection of some six million lats (EUR 8.54 mln) later on Tuesday.
Flick said Airbaltic had already complained to the Competition Council in early July about unequal tariffs in the Riga 
airport.
Riga airport spokesman Martins Langrats told BNS the airport had not received Airbaltic's ultimatum, which the 
airline released to the press.
Airbaltic wants to claim six million lats from the Riga airport over unequal tariffs for different airlines. The company 
said the airport's tariffs had changed on Nov. 1, 2009, but Ireland's low-fares airline Ryanair was still making

AIRPORT, AIRBALTIC FILE CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. "It is unacceptable that the Riga airport has 
increased tariffs for Airbaltic several times since last November in order to cover the losses caused under the 
contract with Ryanair. It is absurd that a company partly owned by the Latvian state must pay twice as much as 
some Irish company," said Bertolt Flick, CEO of the national air carrier Airbaltic, after the Riga airport prepared and 
filed a claim against Airbaltic, in which it aims to collect 2.5 million lats (EUR 3.55 mln) from the airline.
Some two weeks ago Airbaltic turned to the Competition Council to claim about six million lats from the Riga airport 
over unequal tariffs. Riga airport board member Janis Kuzulis said the airport's claim against Airbaltic had nothing 
to do with the airline's intention to sue the airport over discriminative tariff policies. "Our contract with Ryanair has 
been in force since 2004, but the 2.5 million lats claim against Airbaltic applies to the period from November 2009 to 
this summer," he said, adding that Airbaltic had failed to pay 146 bills to the airport in this period.

EXPERTS POINT TO LATVIA'S DEPENDENCE ON RUSSIA'S NATGAS. Among all EU member states, Latvia 
and Bulgaria are most dependant on the natural gas supplied by Russia's gas company Gazprom, shows a study 
by the European Center for International Political Economy (ECIPE).
Latvian daily press digest for business news on Tuesday, July 20
ECIPE experts have created a special index, which shows how interruptions in natural gas supply by Gazprom 
could affect EU countries. Bulgaria would be harmed most (22 points) and Latvia follows right behind (21 points). 
For Latvia's neighbors Estonia and Lithuania the indicator is 18 and 17 points respectively.

HEAT MIGHT INCREASE FOOD PRICES. The hot weather prevailing in Latvia lately is harvest time for sellers of 
various cooling goods and appliances -- the sales of ice cream, beverages, fans, conditioners and other things have 
increased steeply over the past weeks. However, in agriculture heat together with strong showers can affect crops 
in the whole Europe, thus increasing food prices, said economics experts.

DEPOSITS ON RISE IN PAREX BANK. In the first six months of 2010, the amount of deposits attracted by Latvia's 
Parex Bank has increased by 13 percent from the end of last year. The steepest growth was observed in the 
corporate customer segment, as deposits there soared 52 percent. In the segment of individuals and small and 
medium enterprises deposits grew 14 percent from late 2009.

of businessman Boriss Teterevs against several companies, in which he questioned a contract for 50 million euros 
for purchasing three properties in the seaside resort town of Jurmala. The judge did not agree with Teterevs' 
allegation that the multi-million property Kapa had been purchased in his name without his knowledge. The 
complainants could not prove that Teterevs' representative Jelena Lapsa had lost his trust and acted on her own 
initiative.

Latvian national airline Airbaltic to claim EUR 10 mln from Riga airport over unequal tariffs
RIGA, Jul 19, BNS - Latvian national airline Airbaltic wants to claim seven million lats (EUR 10 mln) from the Riga 
International Airport over unequal tariffs for different airlines, Airbaltic President and CEO Bertolt Flick said in a 
press statement on Monday.
Flick said the airport's tariffs had changed on Nov. 1, 2009, but Ireland's low-fares airline Ryanair was still making 
payments in line with the old tariffs. According to the information available to Airbaltic, Ryanair is paying the Riga 
airport 4.5 euros per passenger, including the aircraft landing fees, ground handling and airport fees.
The Airbaltic CEO said the Riga airport on Jan 1, 2010, raised ground-handling tariffs for Airbaltic by 60 percent. 
Besides, the airport also introduced infrastructure fees for ground handling, increasing the company's overall 
expenditures to almost 10 euros per passenger.
Flick said it was unacceptable that the Riga airport had increased tariffs for Airbaltic several times since last 
November in order to cover the losses caused under the contract with Ryanair. "It is absurd that a company partly 
owned by the Latvian state must pay twice as much as some Irish company. We have had countless talks with the 
transport minister and the airport's management over this discrimination, but we have not managed to find a 
solution. Airbaltic has already approached the Competition Council in this regard and prepared an application for 
the court, in which the claim against the Riga International Airport is seven million lats at the moment," Flick said.
The Airbaltic CEO said the Riga airport did not even question the fact that Airbaltic was paying the airport twice as 
much per passenger as Ryanair. Moreover, Airbaltic carries four times as many passengers as Ryanair. Flick said 
Airbaltic did not aim to force Ryanair to pay as much as Airbaltic, but the company would like to sign a similar 
agreement with the airport containing identical privileged conditions as applied to Ryanair.
Latvian national airline Airbaltic to claim EUR 10 mln from Riga airport over unequal tariffs
The Riga International Airport on Monday plans to file with the Riga Regional Court a claim against the Airbaltic for 
collection of a debt totaling more than 2.5 million lats (EUR 3.56 mln). The airport will also ask the court to secure 
the claim by imposing a lien on the payments due to Airbaltic from third parties and the airline's money held by 
banks and other financial institutions. The airport said that Airbaltic had accumulated the debt since late 2009 under 
various commercial contracts with the Riga airport and the total debt now topped 2.5 million lats.
During the first half of 2010, Riga International Airport served 2.094 million passengers at a 15.1 percent rise from 
the same period in 2009. During the full year 2009, the airport saw its passenger numbers grow by 10.2 percent 
from 2008 to 4.067 million.
The 17 airlines operating at Riga airport fly passengers on direct routes to 81 destinations. Riga is the biggest air 
traffic hub in the Baltic states.
In the first six months of 2010, Airbaltic carried 1.472 million passengers at a 22 percent rise from the same period 
a year ago. During the whole year of 2009, the airline carried a total of 2.757 million passengers, up 6.4 percent 
from 2008.
Airbaltic serves direct routes from three Baltic capitals -- Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn -- and also flies passengers on 
several domestic flights in Finland.
Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state, which holds 52.6 percent of shares and Baltijas Aviacijas 
Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems, BAS), which holds 47.2 percent that previously belonged to the Scandinavian 
airline SAS. The sole owner of BAS is Airbaltic CEO Bertolt Flick.

Proceedings between Airbaltic and Riga airport must be set apart from construction of new terminal - Airbaltic
RIGA, Jul 19, BNS - The legal proceedings between the Latvian national airline Airbaltic and the Riga International 
Airport must be set apart from the prospective construction of the new passenger terminal, Airbaltic spokesman 
Janis Vanags told the press on Monday.
Vanags said the agreement between Airbaltic and the Riga airport on land lease for the airline's new terminal would 
soon be submitted to the Competition Council, and the construction of the terminal would begin as soon as the 
competition watchdog gave its approval.
Airbaltic believes that the Riga airport's decision to sue the airline a debt totaling more than 2.5 million lats (EUR 
3.56 mln) was a response to Airbaltic's announcement that the airport applied discriminating tariffs to the Latvian air 
carrier. Vanags said the Riga airport attempted to exert public pressure on Airbaltic rather than solve the problem 
constructively.
"Airbaltic together with the Transport Ministry will try to solve this situation," Vanags said, adding that all airlines 
operating in the Riga airport should have equal conditions. He said Airbaltic was paying about twice as much per 
passenger as Irish low-costs airline Ryanair.
The Riga International Airport plans to file with the Riga Regional Court a claim against the Airbaltic for collection of 
a debt totaling more than 2.5 million lats (EUR 3.56 mln). The airport will also ask the court to secure the claim by

Riga airport says claim against Airbaltic is not response to airline's activities against airport
RIGA, Jul 19, BNS - The Riga International Airport's decision to sue Latvian national air carrier Airbaltic over a debt 
of 2.5 million lats (EUR 3.56 mln) is not a response to Airbaltic's activities against the airport, Riga airport board 
member Janis Kuzulis told BNS.
Kuzulis said the airport's claim against Airbaltic had nothing to do with the airline's intention to sue the airport over 
discriminative tariff policies. "Airbaltic has been delaying payments for a long time already, and the situation has 
been critical also before. We agreed on a debt repayment schedule, but Airbaltic failed to comply with it," Kuzulis 
said, adding that the airline's public activities had no effect on the airport's actions.
The Riga airport board member said Airbaltic had not paid almost 150 bills written by the airport. "It is a business 
decision. The airport and Airbaltic have legal contracts, and the airport must receive payment for the services it 
provides," Kuzulis said, adding that after Airbaltic had failed to agree with the airport on the repayment of the debt, 
the airport was left with nothing else than to sue the airline, otherwise public money would be squandered.
Kuzulis voiced hope that the legal proceedings between the Riga International Airport and Airbaltic would not delay 
the construction of Airbaltic's new terminal.
The airport representative said the claim against Airbaltic had been filed with the Riga Regional Court on Monday. 
The court could not confirm for now whether the application had been received.
The Riga International Airport has filed a claim against the Airbaltic for collection of a debt totaling more than 2.5 
million lats. The airport will also ask the court to secure the claim by imposing a lien on the payments due to

Ryanair reviewing routes from Kaunas - daily
VILNIUS, Jul 07, BNS - Budget carrier Ryanair, which has recently opened its first Central and Eastern European 
(CEE) aircraft base in Kaunas, is reviewing the routes from Lithuania's second-biggest city, the Kauno Diena daily 
reports on Wednesday.
According to Laszlo Tamas, Ryanair's sales and marketing manager for UK, Ireland and Eastern Europe, the 
company is now reviewing all routes from Kaunas and some changes might come into effect from fall.
"We are now monitoring the routes and will take a final decision on the routes and the frequency of flights if we see 
that it is inevitable," Tamas said. No final decisions on the winter schedule had been taken yet, he pointed out.
Experts forecast that Ryanair might stop flights from Kaunas to Bremen (Germany), Birmingham (UK) and Girona 
(Spain) from November.

Passenger traffic through Kaunas International Airport, the second largest in Lithuania, almost doubled in May, 
year-on-year, getting close to 72,000 travellers, the Kauno Diena daily reports on Friday. "Compared with May 
2009, the passenger flow doubled," Arijandas Sliupas, the airport's CEO, told the daily. Occupancy rates were the 
highest on the flights to London, he added. "Cancellation of any flights is out of the question. However, the carriers 
are not speaking about new routes that might be opened from Kaunas, either. Perhaps Ryanair may offer 
something for the winter season, which will be announced in September," Sliupas said. The airport aims to render 
services to more than 700,000 passengers this year. Vilnius newsroom, +370 5 2058524, verslas@bns.lt-

Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair has opened its first Central and Eastern European (CEE) aircraft base in 
Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas. Investments into the base will exceed 140 million US dollars (approx. 
LTL 354 mln, EUR 102.6 mln). Ryanair would station two new Boeings 737 at the Kaunas base, which is Ryanair's 
40th base, and would offer flights to 18 European destinations, the Kaunas Airport reported. "We hope to attract 1 
million passengers per year, which will allow to maintain 1,000 jobs in the companies operating in the airport," Maria 
Macken, Ryanair's Sales and Marketing Executive UK and Ireland, said in a statement. Ryanair announced its 
intentions to set up an aircraft base in Kaunas early in February. The airline's CEO Michael O'Leary then said that 
Kaunas had been chosen thanks to its good infrastructure, successful cooperation between the company and the 
Transport Ministry, the company's four-year experience of operations at the Kaunas Airport and the growth in 
passenger traffic. (EUR 1 = LTL 3.45) Vilnius newsroom, +370 5 2058519, verslas@bns.lt-

Volcanic ash from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull, the eruption of which has intensified again, will not affect Lithuania's

ash will have no direct effects on us," Auryla told BNS adding that people heading to those countries or from them 
could be up to some inconveniences. Ireland's Aer Lingus cancelled Wednesday's flight from Dublin to Vilnius due 
to intensified volcano eruption. However, Ryanair's flight from Dublin will land in Kaunas as scheduled. The

Ryanair, which lost its low-fee status in Riga last year, it trying to put pressure on Tallinn Airport via the minister of 
economy and the public in a bid to pay no airport fees in the Estonian capital in return for bringing 1.5 million new 
passengers here, the daily Eesti Paevaleht reported.
In a letter to the parties involved, Ryanair pledges to double the number of passengers arriving in Tallinn.
"What they're offering is the same pattern that the competition authority of Latvia banned in Riga," Tallinn Airport 
board member Erik Sakkov told the newspaper.
The Latvian competition authority by a decision last fall ordered the airport of Riga to scrap its volume based fee 
arrangement offering an advantage to Ryanair. As a result, the airport of Riga had to make fees uniform for all 
operators.
"It's hopeless trying to come as low as to make Ryanair fly," Sakkov said. The offer by Ryanair contains a demand 
that the airport fee be zero euros per passenger starting from an annual passenger volume of 950,000, plus free 
service.
Currently the passenger fee alone at Tallinn Airport is 110 kroons (EUR 7.03) per person, to which various other 
charges are added.
"If they reach their goal and carry a million passengers, someone has to give us 130 million kroons to service 
them," Sakkov said.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs said Ryanair has been constantly in touch with them, but added that the contracts 
and prices had to be agreed by the parties on their own.

Under the offer, Ryanair would operate direct flights between Tallinn and Milan, Girona, Brussels, Duesseldorf,

Germany's air carrier Lufthansa has cancelled Monday's flighs from Frankfurt to Vilnius due to pilots' strike, 
Gabriele Vasiliauskaite, the head of communication at Vilnius Airport, has confirmed to BNS. Lufthansa pilots began

Air carriers Star1 Airlines and Airbaltic welcome the plans of Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair to expand operations 
in Kaunas Airport. Although some destinations offered by Ryanair from the second largest Lithuania's city coincide 
with the destinations offered by Lithuania's Star1 Airlines and Latvia's Airbaltic from Vilnius, the carriers claim to be 
not afraid of competition, the Lietuvos Rytas reports on Wednesday. 
"We are positive about new companies and new flights. Competition is always welcome. The question is about 
quality. Our service differs from that of Ryanair. We offer free carriage of baggage, free registration. We hope to 
retain our group of customers. We believe that business customers will stay with us," Martynas Laivys, CEO of 
Star1 Airlines, told the daily. The representatives of Airbaltic, the largest Baltic air carrier, claimed to be not afraid of 
changes at Lithuania's airports either. "If the new routes of Airbaltic attracted the flights of other companies, it would 
be an important step forward for Lithuania's aviation," Airbaltic's representatives said. The Irish air carrier currently 
offers direct flights from Lithuania's second-biggest city to London (Luton and Stansted), Dublin, Birmingham, 
Liverpool, Frankfurt and Bremen. From April the company will launch flights from Kaunas to Brussels Charleroi 
Airport, and from May - flights to Barcelona, Paris, Milan, Berlin, Duesseldorf, Oslo, Edinburgh, London (Gatwick)

- COURT DECLINES INSOLVENCY LAWSUIT AGAINST DHL LATVIA EXPRESS DELIVERIES CO
Riga Regional Court on Wednesday dismissed an insolvency lawsuit that had been filed against DHL Latvia 
express deliveries companies, court representatives told BNS.
Thus, the company has been declared solvent.
The lawsuit had been filed by the insolvency administrator of Kendi company.
LATVIAN GASOLINE IMPORTS DROP 7.6 PCT IN 2009; DIESEL FUEL IMPORTS FALL 6 PCT Y-O-Y
DHL Latvia representative Ilze Vitina told BNS that DHL was Latvia's leading provider of logistics services and fully 
capable of meeting its liabilities.
"All commitments to clients are being and will be met in line with the existing and future contracts. The Kendi 
administrator filed the insolvency application with the court in connection with Kendi's claim over a damaged 
consignment, worth 2,790 lats (EUR 4,000). DHL Latvia argues that the claim is groundless, since the damage has 
not been documentary confirmed. The company will submit all the necessary legal documents to the court to prove 
the groundlessness of the case," Vitina said.
DHL Latvia posted 12.633 million lats in 2008 sales at a 3.8 percent rise from the year before, and a 568,000 lats 
loss in contrast to a profit in 2007.
According to the Latvian business register, DHL Latvia was established in March 1995 and the company's share 
capital is 50,400 lats. Its sole owner is German-registered company Deutsche Post Beteiligungen Holding Gmbh.

- IRISH LOW-COST AIRLINE RYANAIR CONTINUES TALKS ABOUT OPENING OF BASES IN BALTICS, CEE
The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair continues talks with airports about opening of Ryanair bases in the Baltic states, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Laszlo Tamas, Ryanair Sales and Marketing Manager for Ireland, the UK and Central 
Europe, told BNS.
He confirmed that Ryanair had not put off the plan about opening one of its bases in the Riga airport in the Latvian 
capital. He said that Ryanair definitely had not stopped the project about setting up a base in Riga.
"I can confirm that we are holding talks with several airports in the Baltic states as well as in Central and Eastern 
Europe, and Riga is one of them," said the Ryanair representative.
He said that Ryanair focused on finding a partner that would fit the airline's business model and could ensure the 
lowest costs in the long term. With low costs in the airports and low-cost aircraft bases, Ryanair can guarantee 
lower air fares, said Tamas.
He expressed hope that Ryanair would soon be able to announce opening of several new bases in the Central and 
Eastern Europe.
Ryanair announced recently that it planned to open its first Central European aircraft base in Lithuania's second-
biggest city of Kaunas in May this year. Investments in the Kaunas base, which will be Ryanair's 40th base, will 
amount to more than 140 million US dollars. The Irish air carrier, which holds roughly 95 percent of the passenger 
market at Kaunas Airport, currently offers direct flights from Kaunas to London (Luton and Stansted), Dublin, 
Birmingham, Liverpool, Frankfurt am Main (Hahn) and Bremen.
At the end of October 2009 Ryanair said that it planned to implement the project about opening its base in the Riga 
airport in the nearest future.
Reports about Ryanair's plans to set up a base in the Riga airport date back to summer 2006.
Ryanair started its operations in Latvia in 2004. Currently, Ryanair flies from Riga to 13 destinations in Europe.

The Riga international airport in the Latvian capital continues talks with the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair about 
setting up a Ryanair base in Riga, the Riga airport spokesman Martins Langrats told BNS.
He said he was unable to give any detailed comments about Ryanair's recent statement about launching its base in 
Kaunas, Lithuania, and whether the Irish airline would be interested to establish a base in another Baltic state, 
namely, in Riga, after opening the base in Kaunas.
But Langrats confirmed that the talks between the Riga airport and Ryanair on the subject had not been terminated.

Krisjanis Peters, the board chairman of the state-owned Riga International Airport, told BNS at the time that he was 
not in a position to disclose all details but the airport had received a draft agreement about setting up a Ryanair 
base. "I think this is a very important step, in particular in view of recent speculations about Ryanair's alleged 
intention to withdraw from the Latvia market," he said.

Despite its new discount policy Vilnius airport is unlikely to achieve such fast growth as Riga airport used to show, 
said Krisjanis Peters, CEO of the international airport of Riga.
"First of all, we have a better geographical position. Secondly, I have a strong feeling that the overall service 
package of Vilnius airport is more expensive," the Riga airport CEO said.
Peters also noted that differences between the two airports were substantial. "Discounts in a small shop are one 
thing, but those offered by a large company with a broad range of products is another. We have 70 direct flights 
against Vilnius airport's approximately 20 direct connections. These are incomparable offers. As we know, Tallinn 
and Vilnius are our main feeders -- the most popular flights from Tallinn and Vilnius are to Riga," said Peters.
Janis Kuzulis, a board member of Riga airport, told BNS that the airports in Vilnius and Tallinn are unlikely to catch 
up with Riga in terms of development if Riga succeeds in carrying out its development projects, which are supposed 
to increase the airport's capacity. "Riga is the absolute aviation leader in the Baltics, and it has all the chances to 
develop beyond the reach of other Baltic airports, if the airport continues to develop. If Riga exhausts its existing 
capacity and does not go further, it will give a chance to Tallinn and Vilnius to gradually close the large gap. The 
championship is not yet over -- we have not been crowned for life," the representative said.
Kuzulis also said that Riga airport currently serves nearly twice as many passengers than the airports in Tallinn and 
Vilnius together. "If somebody thinks in Latvia that the Lithuanians and Estonians have resigned to this situation, 
they are mistaken. They are willing to fight for their positions quite aggressively, to prevent the dominance of Riga 
and Latvia in aviation," said Kuzulis.
RIGA AIRPORT CEO SKEPTICAL ABOUT VILNIUS AIRPORT'S CHANCES OF CATCHING UP WITH 
LATVIAN RIVAL
In November 2009, Vilnius airport decided to sharply slash the fees it charged for its services to attract new carriers 
and increase the number of flights. The airport has cut its passenger duty and is set to apply differentiate its fees on 
existing routes depending on the number of passengers flown by each carrier.
Riga airport abolished its discount system, which was also based on passenger numbers, on Nov. 1, 2009. The old 
discount system was especially favorable to Ireland's Ryanair and Latvia's Airbaltic airline that served the highest 
numbers of passengers in Riga.
In 2009 the Riga airport served 4.067 million passengers, which is a growth by 10.2 percent or 376,200 passengers 
from 2008.
The international airport of Riga is the largest Baltic airport by passenger turnover and a state-owned company.

- 51 PCT OF LATVIANS MAKE PURCHASES IN OTHER COUNTRIES DURING FOREIGN TRIPS - SURVEY
More than a half or 51 percent of Latvia's residents, who made purchases in other countries, did this during foreign 
trips, according to a survey carried out as part of the consumer rights information campaign "Runa Drosi!" (Speak 
Up!).
Sanita Gertmane, the head of the Consumer Information and Communication Department under the Latvian 
Consumer Rights Protection Center (PTAC), told the press that 20 percent of the respondents made their 
purchases on the Internet and 15 percent had asked their relatives or friends to bring or send those products to 
Latvia from foreign countries.
Most of the respondents, who make purchases abroad, are young people aged 18-34 years, people with higher 
education and high income, and residents of the Latvian capital Riga.
The survey revealed that about two-thirds or 65 percent of Latvia's population have made purchases abroad during 
the last two years. Most of the goods purchased abroad were clothing and footwear (71 percent), food and 
beverages (62 percent), accessories (41 percent), toys and products for children (30 percent).

carried out by SKDS polling company, was conducted on January 20-25, 2010, and covered 1,000 permanent 
residents of Latvia aged between 18 and 74 years.
The PTAC deals with complaints and applications by consumers about violations of consumer rights and offers 
legal assistance. The PTAC operates under the supervision of the Latvian Economics Ministry.

The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair served 875,000 passengers at the Riga airport last year at a five percent rise from 
2008, said Laszlo Tamas, Ryanair sales and marketing manager for the UK, Ireland and Central and Eastern 
Europe.
Tamas told BNS that despite the recession, Ryanair passenger numbers kept increasing month by month.
In 2008, Ryanair served 832,000 passengers at the Riga airport.
Ryanair launched operations in Riga airport on Oct. 31, 2004, opening flights from Riga to Tampere, London and 
Stockholm. Today Ryanair flies from Riga to 12 destinations in Europe.
Last year Riga International Airport served 4.067 million passengers, which is 10.2 percent or 376,200 people more 
than in 2008.
The state-owned Riga airport is the largest Baltic airport by the number of passengers.

- LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES IN LATVIAN CURRENCY LIKELY TO CONTINUE DECLINING IN NEAR 
FUTURE - NORDEA
Short-term interest rates in the Latvian national currency, the lat, are currently at the lowest possible level, while 
long-term interest rates could continue to decline in the near future, said Andris Larins, a finance analyst with 
Nordea Markets.
IRELAND 'S RYANAIR CARRIER SERVES 5 PCT MORE PASSENGERS IN RIGA IN 2009
Larins told BNS that the Council of the Bank of Latvia had decided on Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged, 
as earlier measures were currently bearing fruit, particularly the reduction of the reserve requirements at the initial 
stage of the economic crisis. Thanks to this measure, banks have many more lats than necessary to fulfill the 
mandatory reserve requirements. "Of course, lat interest rates are also affected by the health of Latvia's economy 
and lending market, which do not report much positive news at the moment," Larins added.
He said that according to the data of January 13, banks had more than 1.1 billion lats (EUR 1.57 b) in hand, while 
only 673.7 million lats were required to fulfill the mandatory reserve requirements. The banks can lend lats to the 
Bank of Latvia at a rate of one percent, lend them to the state or distribute in loans.
"Unfortunately, declining lat interest rates do not yet indicate long-term stability, and we are still very far away from 
the level of euro rates, for example, the most popular loan rate - the three-month RIGIBOR. Therefore short-term 
interest rates in lats are at the lowest possible level (with the Bank of Latvia deposit rate as the point of reference), 
but long-term interest rates can continue to decline in the near future, because there is a large supply of lats in the 
market," Larins said.
On Thursday, the RIGIBOR rate was 1.24 percent (1.24 on Wednesday) on overnight loans, 1.26 percent (1.26 pct) 
on one-day loans, 1.40 percent (1.40 pct) on one-week loans, 2.01 percent (2.03 pct) on one-month loans, 4.81 
percent (5.13 pct) on three-month loans, 7.21 percent (7.25 pct) on six-month loans and 8.91 percent (8.93 pct) on 
one-year loans in lats.

- DEPOSITS IN LATVIA CONTINUED TO GROW IN DEC 2009 - C.BANK HEAD
Deposits in Latvia continued to grow in December last year, the Bank of Latvia Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told the 
press on Thursday.
He said that people could already see how organizing public finances and adopting this year's budget played a 
great role in stabilizing Latvia's economy.
"The uncertainty in the financial markets has declined significantly -- lat interest rates for three months have 
dropped from almost 14 percent in November 2009 to 5.5 percent today. It is also reflected in the decline of loan 
interest rates for Latvia's businesses and individuals. For several months, deposits in banks have also been 
growing. According to the preliminary information, the growth of deposits also continued in December -- by 4.6 
percent or 225 million lats [EUR 320 mln] month-on-month or by 1.7 percent year-on-year," Rimsevics said.
In November 2009, the total amount of deposits in banks rose for the second consecutive month -- by 0.8 percent 
or 71 million lats from the month before to 9.123 billion lats. This includes growth of resident deposits by 0.8 percent 
or 46 million lats and growth of non-resident deposits by 0.7 percent or 25 million lats. But aggregate deposits held 
by the Latvian banks at the end of November this year have dropped by 6.1 percent year-on-year.

- IT IS VITAL FOR LATVIA NOT TO MISS OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT EURO IN 2014 - C.BANK
It is vital for Latvia not to miss the opportunity to adopt the euro in 2014, the Bank of Latvia Governor Ilmars 
Rimsevics told the press on Thursday.
He urged the Latvian government to start timely preparations for euro adoption -- put in order the country's budget 
and economy, so that in 2014 the budget deficit does not exceed 3 percent of the gross domestic product and in 
IRELAND 'S RYANAIR CARRIER SERVES 5 PCT MORE PASSENGERS IN RIGA IN 2009
2013 Latvia is invited to join the eurozone. Missing this chance would mean that euro adoption in Latvia may have 
to be postponed until 2017-2018.
"Therefore we would like to be ready in 2013, but there is still a lot of work ahead to achieve it," Rimsevics said.
As regards Estonia's potential accession to the eurozone in 2011, Rimsevics said he wished the Estonian 
colleagues to achieve it. Moreover, it will be a signal that there is no downsizing of the eurozone -- quite the 
opposite, countries that meet the criteria can adopt the euro. It would also be an important message and a 
motivating factor for politicians and Latvian entrepreneurs on the way to introducing the euro in 2014.
However, Rimsevics admitted that introducing the euro in Estonia already next year would have a negative effect on 
Latvia. "In the future, every investor or producer, choosing where to invest his money and produce, will be more 
familiar with an environment where the euro has already been introduced, where there will be no risks concerning 
different interest rates and potential talks about changing the currency exchange rate," the Bank of Latvia governor 
said.
He added that euro adoption in Estonia would be an additional positive factor in terms of GDP and new work places 
in the country.
The Latvian government intends to set January 1, 2014 as the target date for euro adoption in Latvia.

- EXPORTS TO DRIVE LATVIAN ECONOMY IN COMING YEARS - C. BANK HEAD
The Latvian economy is gradually shifting its focus to exports which will be the main driving force in the coming 
years, Bank of Latvia Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told the press on Thursday.
He said the latest statistics about the gross domestic product (GDP) showed that in the third quarter of 2009 it had 
contracted slightly from the previous quarter in real terms but there were also positive signs - improved 
competitiveness of Latvian companies and gradual revival of demand on most of Latvia's external markets lead to 
small growth of exports.
"Following a steep decline in late 2008 and early 2009, physical volume of exports has been rising for two 
consecutive quarters, namely, in the second and third quarters of last year. The latest figures suggest further rise as 
output in the manufacturing industry is growing mainly in the export-oriented industries -- timber industry, metal 
processing and chemical industry," said Rimsevics.
This leads to the conclusion that the Latvian economy is gradually shifting its focus to exports which will be the main 
driving force in the coming years until sound growth gradually revived also the domestic demand, he said.
He said that expectations of steady recovery in the economy and exports were based on improving 
competitiveness. The gap between wages and productivity that occurred in previous years has narrowed 
substantially, said the central bank head.
By the third quarter of 2009 labor costs per unit in manufacturing industry reduced by 14.9 percent from the peak at 
the end of 2008 and this was due not only to wage cuts but also to further increase of productivity in the Latvian 
economy observed for the second quarter in a row, said Rimsevics.
Growth of productivity will also influence further economic forecasts as it was the indicator preceding the economic 
cycle and thus the forerunner of the anticipated economic growth, said the Bank of Latvia governor, adding that the 
bank has not changed its estimate of a 2-2.5 percent GDP drop from 2010.
Consumer prices are likely to keep falling at a moderate pace throughout the year with average annual deflation 
estimated at 3.8 percent, said Rimsevics. But the central bank expects reasonable inflation to return to Latvia 
already at the end of next year when prices were likely to show growth year-on-year.
IRELAND 'S RYANAIR CARRIER SERVES 5 PCT MORE PASSENGERS IN RIGA IN 2009
The price growth will be affected by recovery of the global economy and the related growth of prices for imports, 
including energy resources and food, as well as by gradual revival of the Latvian economy, said the central bank 
head.
The average annual inflation in Latvia in 2009 was 3.5 percent.

The following are other major headlines in Latvia by 5 p.m. Friday not yet covered by the BNS English news wire.
The Swedish Court of Appeals has lifted the eight-month jail term that the Gothenburg District Court slapped on a 
Russian-speaking Latvian citizen in October and instead ordered the man to pay a fine equivalent to 500 US 
dollars, the Swedish mass media reported.
The 33-year-old man tried to open a cabin door when aboard a flying Ryanair plane. He was restrained by two 
professional Latvian boxers who happened to be on the same flight. Afterwards the man said he had started 
drinking to suppress his fear of flying and hardly remembered anything.
The number of persons, who have acquired a PhD in Latvia during the academic year 2008-09, has increased by 
one-fourth to 174 as compared to 139 persons, who received their PhDs in the previous academic year.
This increase is partly due to sizable scholarships from the EU structural funds, the Higher Education Department 
under the Latvian Education and Science Ministry said in the report about higher education in Latvia in 2009.
The Latvian Constitutional Court has made a ruling regarding the procedure for compensation of the cost of 
medicines in case of rare diseases and found that the ceiling for the said compensation is constitutional.
An application to the court was made in relation of compensations for the cost of drugs required for a child suffering 
from Gaucher's disease.

The Irish low cost airline Ryanair plans to implement the project about opening its base in the Riga airport in the 
Latvian capital in the nearest future, Laszlo Tamas, Ryanair Sales and Marketing Manager for Ireland, the UK and 
Central Europe, told the press.
He said that Ryanair and the Riga airport management were discussing the possibility of opening a Ryanair base in 
Riga and that it would more easier for the airline to operate if it had a base also in the Latvian capital. At present 
Ryanair was flying to Riga only from the cities that already had Ryanair bases. If there was also a base in Riga, it 
would be easier for the airline to plan and expand its flight network from the Latvian capital, said Tamas.
Krisjanis Peters, the board chairman of the Riga International Airport, told BNS that he was not in a position to 
disclose all details but the airport had received a draft agreement about setting up a Ryanair base. " I think this is a 
very important step, in particular in view of recent speculations about Ryanair's alleged intention to withdraw from 
the Latvia market," he said.
The Riga airport management has started reviewing the terms proposed by Ryanair and would also prepare their 
own proposals for cooperation to be put before the Irish airline.
Peters would not make any predictions as to when there might be greater clarity about development of a Ryanair 
base in the Riga airport because the negotiations about a possibility of opening a Ryanair base in Riga had started 
several years ago.
Ryanair started its operations in Latvia in 2004. Currently, Ryanair flies from Riga to 13 destinations in Europe.
The state-owned Riga airport is the largest Baltic airport by the number of passengers.

- DISCUSSIONS ON VAT INCREASE IN LATVIA NOT NEEDED - FINMIN
There is currently no need to discuss the increase of the value added tax (VAT) in Latvia, because the government 
has achieved the 500 million lats (EUR 711 mln) consolidation in the next year's budget as promised to the 
international lenders, said Latvian Finance Minister Einars Repse in an interview to BNS.
"Currently there is no need to even discuss the increase of VAT, because the government has achieved the 500 
million lats consolidation [in 2010 budget] through other measures. We have always said this, and it is a strict 
position that we will only start discussions on increasing VAT if we do not manage to achieve the 500 million lats 
consolidation in a different way. But we have managed it," Repse said.
"We [the government] will not have to return to the discussion on increasing VAT. Firstly, I believe that we need 
stability in the tax sector. Everyone has become used to these discussions, but we must finally put an end to it and 
there has to be clarity about the future. Secondly, we have not even pledged to revise something in the middle of 
the year," Repse said, asked whether a deteriorating economic situation might not force the government to return to 
VAT increase by amending the 2010 budget, for example.
The finance minister also said that the agreement with the international lenders on increasing VAT was more 
related to the very budget drafting process. "It does not concern so much the [budget] amendments. So, if we have 
prepared the budget and if we have done what we promised, that is, ensured the 500 million lats consolidation, we 
can stand on not increasing any of the major taxes in the future and not discussing VAT increase or introduction of 
a progressive personal income tax. This will be our position," Repse said.

- HALF OF MONTHLY PAY MEANS SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES FOR ONE THIRD OF LATVIANS - POLL
One third of Latvians believe that significant expenses are those that exceed half of their monthly pay, shows a 
survey by Latvia's SEB Bank.
The bank's spokeswoman Agnese Strazda told BNS that among the surveyed people, 37 percent said that they 
considered the expenses "big" if they exceeded 25 percent of their monthly pay, but 23 percent of people said that 
spending was significant if it was above 10 percent of their salary.
Strazda said that the more regularly people planned their budget, the lower sums they considered as major 
expenses -- half of the people who always planned their income and spending, said that major expenses were 
those over 10 percent of their salaries.
The bank also pointed out that young people (aged 26-32) more often said that significant expenses were those 
that exceeded one tenth of their monthly pay. Meanwhile, of all age groups, people aged 46-52 were the ones that 
most frequently said they believed that major expenses were those that exceeded half of their monthly pay.
According to Strazda, there is also a major difference between the opinions of ethnic Latvians and people of other 
ethnicities. While 31 percent of ethnic Latvians thought spending over 10 percent of their monthly pay was big and 
41 percent considered expenses as significant if they exceeded 25 percent of their salaries, the percentage of 
Russian-speakers in these categories was only 18 percent and 27 percent respectively.
The survey also shows that majority of the respondents (65 pct) always coordinate large purchases with their family 
members. Moreover, those are most frequently the people who carefully plan their family budget. One tenth of the 
respondents rarely coordinate major purchases with their family, and 3 percent never do it. This trend also differs 
between men and women -- men are more likely to make large purchases without coordinating them (5 pct of men 
vs 2 pct of women) or coordinating them rarely (14 pct vs 6 pct).
SEB Bank carried out the survey in cooperation with Market Data pollster, surveying over 820 people.

- LATVIAN CONSTRUCTION COSTS DROP 15 PCT Y-O-Y IN SEPT
(adds comments by industry association)
In September 2009 construction costs in Latvia fell 15 percent on average against the same month a year ago, the 
central statistics office said.
The statistics office noted that, compared to September 2008, this year the steepest drop was for builders' wages 
that fell 27.4 percent, while construction materials declined in price by 10.9 percent and the costs of the 
maintenance and operation of machines and equipment decreased by 5.8 percent.
Compared to August 2009, in September construction costs dipped on average by 2.1 percent. Builders' wages 
decreased by 5.6 percent, while the costs of the maintenance and operation of machines and equipment decreased 
by 1 percent and construction materials moved down in price by 0.9 percent month-on-month. The drop in 
construction costs was mainly influenced by decreased costs in the construction of transport objects, as well as 
construction and renovation of educational, health care and sports buildings.
In the third quarter of 2009, compared to the same period last year, construction costs in Latvia fell on average by 
14.4 percent. Builders' wages saw the steepest decline, contracting by 25.4 percent, while the price of construction 
materials dropped 11.1 percent and the costs of the maintenance and operation of machines and equipment 
decreased by 4.8 percent. The drop in construction costs was mainly influenced by decreased costs in the 
construction of transport objects, as well as construction and renovation of industrial, agricultural and commercial 
buildings.
Latvian Builders Association (LBA) president Viktors Purins told BNS that the decline of construction costs was 
adequate and likely to continue but probably at a slower pace. He said it was difficult to say when the downward 
movement could stop.
Purins said that the construction companies would have hard time also this year and in the first half of 2010 as 
wages were falling steeply and dumping was common during construction tenders. "There are 12, 28 or 37 
companies bidding for a construction contract. What else can they do but to evade taxes," said the association 
president, adding that prices for construction materials offered during the tenders also were inadequate which 
suggest use of sub-quality materials.
He said that the situation in the construction industry was abnormal. "If the present situation continued and 
everyone would keep thinking in short term, the construction market will be destroyed and customers also would not 
gain anything from this," said Purins.
The construction costs statistics are based on information provided by 132 construction firms and 29 trading 
companies. The builders provide the prices of all resources, while the traders only inform about the prices of 
construction materials. The construction firms are selected by choosing companies with the highest amount of 
construction works performed by the companies themselves. The construction firms represent various areas of 
specialization and Latvia's regions. The selection of building materials traders is based on sales and specialization.

- LATVIAN SAVINGS BANK DISPOSES OF HOLDINGS IN CO WITH 100-PERCENT SUBSIDIARY IN UKRAINE
Latvijas Krajbanka (Latvian Savings Bank) has disposed of the 51 percent of shares in held in Center Credit, a 
company which is the 100-percent owner of a Ukrainian-registered company Spozhyv Servis, the bank said in a 
report to the NASDAQ OMX Riga stock exchange.
Latvijas Krajbanka said it had terminated its participation in Center Credit by selling its 561,076 shares to Berentel 
Projects Ltd. The bank did not specify the amount of the transaction in the statement to the stock exchange.
RYANAIR TO OPEN BASE IN RIGA AIRPORT IN NEAREST FUTURE
On October 20, 2008, Latvijas Krajbanka signed an agreement on acquisition of a 51 percent stake in Center Credit 
for 717,100 US dollars.
"With the acquisition of 51 percent of shares in Center Credit, which holds 100 percent of shares in Spozhyv Servis 
company registered in the Ukraine, the bank will continue implementing its strategy, which foresees development of 
the full range of financial services, including lending services," Latvijas Krajbanka said in a statement back then.
According to the information on the Latvian business register, Latvijas Krajbanka used to hold 51 percent in the 
investment company Center Credit, and the remaining 49 percent are held by a Russian individual, who acquired 
them on Oct 1 this year. Center Credit closed last year with a loss of 144,100 lats (EUR 205,000).
At the end of June 2009, Latvijas Krajbanka was the ninth largest bank among Latvia's 27 banks in terms of assets, 
according to the information provided by the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, which does not include 
Parex bank, which was the second largest bank in Latvia in terms of assets last autumn.
At the end of last year, the largest shareholder of Latvijas Krajbanka with 76.58 pct was Lithuania's Snoras bank.

- GROWTH OF RETAIL SALES IN LATVIA UNLIKELY UNTIL HOUSEHOLDS CAN PLAN THEIR BUDGETS WITH 
MORE ACCURACY - C. BANK
Latvia cannot expect steady growth of retail sales until households are able to plan their budgets with more 
accuracy, the Bank of Latvia economics expert Agnese Bicevska.
She said that people continued to restrict their spending both due to reduction of their incomes and uncertainty 
about future income and likely costs following taxation changes. At the same time, car sales have already 
responded to the changes in the economy, correcting the excesses of previous years.
"The conclusions from analysis of record-high declines in sales year-on-year would different depending on whether 
care sales are counted in the retail sales. With car sales included, the figure showed the steepest decline already in 
April but without car sales the biggest reduction in retail sales was recorded only recently. It can be explained by the 
fact that the demand for cars was the first to respond to the economic recession before people started giving up 
new furniture, TV sets or books and the demand for daily consumer goods followed," said Bicevska.
She said that since the beginning of the year the Latvian Road Traffic Safety Directorate had been registering only 
about 1,500 cars monthly which is below even the 1995 level. At the same time, record-high car imports to Latvia in 
previous years had resulted in a car fleet corresponding to the EU average, although mostly based on borrowed 
money and priorities different from those of conservative European population, because income of Latvians is lower 
by half than the average income in the EU.
"Therefore we can expect the secondary car market and car re-exports to remain more active for some time to 
come. But there is also a positive aspect to this -- dwindling car imports is one of the factors contributing to 
improvement of Latvia's foreign trade balance," said the Bank of Latvia expert.
She said that no steady growth of retail sales could be expected in Latvia until households were able to plan their 
budgets with more accuracy. "This is closely related to the possibilities of economy recovery that are likely mostly in 
the export sector which means that domestic demand and sales dynamics would remain slow for a while," said 
Bicevska.
During the first nine months of 2009, sales by Latvian retail companies fell 27.7 percent in constant prices against 
the same period a year ago, reaching 2.746 billion lats (EUR 3.907 b). Exclusive of fuel sales, Latvia's nine-month 
retail sales plummeted 29.7 percent year-on-year to 2.257 billion lats.

The nine-month statistics reveal that food retail sales plunged 20.8 percent year-on-year, while retail sales of non-
food goods plummeted 31.1 percent against the nine months of 2008.
In September 2009, compared to August, Latvian retail sales dropped 1.6 percent in seasonally adjusted constant 
prices, with sales of non-food products declining 1.5 percent and food sales dipping 1.8 percent.

- LATVIA'S TAXPAYERS ARE RELATIVELY DISCIPLINED - STATE REVENUE SERVICE
Taxpayers in Latvia are relatively disciplined and try to meet their obligations in the best way possible, said the 
acting head of the Latvian State Revenue Service (VID), Nellija Jezdakova, during the Economic Council meeting 
on Friday.
Jezdakova said that Latvians were law-abiding people who tried to meet their obligations in the best way possible. 
"Given our [current] situation, when the GDP has fallen 18 percent and the corporate income tax revenues have 
slumped 61 percent, one has to conclude that our tax payers are more disciplined than, for example, in France," 
Jezdakova said, adding that in France revenues from corporate income tax had declined by 60 percent upon a 0.1 
percentage point GDP drop.
The acting head of the Latvian tax authority said that in the first nine months of 2009, VID-administered budget 
revenues (including both tax and non-tax revenues) made up 2.996 billion lats (EUR 4.263 b), which was by 60 
million lats less than planned. Thus, the VID-administered revenue plan in January-September this year has been 
completed by 98 percent. But VID revenues have declined by 23.4 percent in the first nine months of this year 
compared to a year ago.
In January-September 2009, VID has collected 149.12 million lats in corporate income tax revenues, down 61.9 
percent from the same period last year and amounting to 91.4 percent of the expected corporate income tax 
revenues.
Value added tax (VAT) revenues have been collected in the amount of 632.34 million lats, which is by 28.8 percent 
less than last year, but a little above the target, Jezdakova said.
As regards the excise tax, revenues from it saw the steepest decline in March and April this year, but increased 
again in May and are currently stable. Revenues from the excise tax in the first nine months of this year amount to 
384 million lats, down 5.5 percent from last year and almost as much as previously expected.
Statutory social insurance contributions in January-September this year amounted to 1.032 billion lats, which is by 
16.6 percent less than in the same period last year, but at the previously expected amount for this period. Personal 
income tax revenues amounted to 559.7 million lats, down 26.1 percent from last year, and the tax plan has been 
completed by 96.3 percent.
According to VID statistics, in the first nine months of 2009 the total tax revenues made up 2.781 billion lats, which 
is by 25.3 percent less than in the same period last year.

The Irish carrier Aer Lingus has long been interested in opening flights between Tallinn and London, but Tallinn 
Airport has not been able to offer suitable terms for the company, the daily Eesti Paevaleht reported.
The paper said the talks had been going on for half a year but with progress. Neither the company nor the airport 
gave a closer comment on them.
But CEO of Tallinn Airport Rein Loik denied that Aer Lingus had given up the idea of opening flights.
Meanwhile Aer Lingus, a subsidiary of Ryanair, launched flights between Vilnius and London. A few years ago 
Ryanair dropped the idea of coming to the Estonian market as it foud the airport fees were too high.

Ireland's budget airline Ryanair carried 239,000 passengers to and from Kaunas International Airport in Lithuania

Ireland's low-cost carrier Ryanair may reduce the number of its flights to and from Riga due to the airport's new 
price policy, Riga airport CEO Krisjanis Peters told BNS.
"Clearly, they [Ryanair] have expressed their complaints about the airport's changed tariff policy. Ryanair did not 
say they could leave Riga, but there have been indication that the company could cut flights," the head of Riga 
airport said.
In Peters' words, the Irish no-frills airline has not yet said how many of its flights from Riga could be scrapped, and 
Riga airport is set to talk about it with Ryanair in September.
"Their position, however, is understandable -- if there are no discounts for passenger numbers, they have no 
reason to sell air tickets for one lat (EUR 0.71) at the end of the year, only to ensure that the plane is full," Peters 
said.
"In Ryanair's case, the Irish company has no reason to fly packed planes for low prices if they do not get discounts 
for that from the airport, so most probably, the airline will cut some of its flights. But I do not think Ryanair is going to 
talk about leaving Riga, as Riga airport is the only central airport in Europe at which Ryanair operates. Elsewhere, 
this airline flies to second-rate airports," Peters said.
Under the new tariff policy, Riga airport will no longer provide discounts to some carriers for the number of 
passengers flown and will charge the same fees from all airlines. Moreover, the fees have been reduced 
approximately threefold. The new system will take effect as of Nov. 1, 2009, and it will remain in force until Dec. 31, 
2010.

In 2008, Ryanair served 840,757 passengers at Riga airport, taking 22.8 percent of the market. Ryanair launched 
operations in Riga in 2004. The airline flies passengers to 13 destinations from Riga.
Riga is the biggest airport in the Baltics by passenger numbers.

- NATGAS PRICE DROPS INSUFFICIENT TO CUT END-TARIFFS FOR ELECTRIC POWER - LATVENERGO 
ENERGY CO
The recent price drops for natural gas have not been significant enough to leave a serious influence on the end-
tariffs of electricity and prompt their reduction in Latvia, a spokesman for Latvia's Latvenergo energy company said.
Latvenergo spokesman Andris Siksnis said the gas price was one of the key components of heating tariffs in Latvia, 
as most thermal plants used natural gas as well as electricity.
Citing July data about natural gas prices, the Latvenergo spokesman indicated that the gas purchase price was 
155.93 lats (EUR 221.87) per 1,000 cubic meters, which was the lowest figure since the second half of 2007, and 
the price was continuing to decline thanks to decreased fuel oil prices.
"Unfortunately, the current price level is not sufficient to leave a serious influence on the end-tariff of electric power, 
because it has to be taken into account that the tariffs approved in the previous years were much lower than the 
gas purchase price," the spokesman said.
The price for natural gas should fall to 130 lats per 1,000 cubic meters to influence the end tariff of electric power, 
Siksnis said.
Electricity tariffs last changed in Latvia on April 1, 2008, when electricity bills for individual consumers went up by 
39.2 percent and for corporate consumers by 36 percent. Currently, electricity is sold to households for 0.071 lats 
per kilowatt-hour.
Latvenergo, fully owned by the state, generates power at its three hydro power stations on the Daugava River and 
two thermal power plants in Riga. If necessary, electricity is also imported.

- LATVIAN POSTAL CO CONSIDERS SETTING UP MOBILE POST OFFICES TO SOLVE PROFITABILITY 
ISSUES
Latvijas Pasts postal company considers setting up mobile post offices, the company's board member Dita Danosa 
told BNS.
"This would help solve the problem of unprofitable post offices. This model is already successfully working 
elsewhere in Europe -- mobile post offices are open on certain hours in populated places where maintaining a 
stationary post office is unprofitable," the representative said.
Latvijas Pasts CEO Maiga Dzervite noted, meanwhile, that those post offices whose turnovers were very small 
were working shorter hours. "So it will not make a big difference if the post office arrives on wheels," she added.
The representatives of the postal company estimated that up to 100 such mobile post stations could be needed in 
Latvia, and that 10-12 mobile stations could be tested for the beginning.

Latvijas Pasts has not specified the date by which the project could be launched. "It is only a conceptual idea for the 
time being. But the model is already working very well in Europe," Danosa said, indicating that the project also 
involved some security-related issues.
Currently, there are some 700 post offices operating in Latvia, and nearly one third of them make no more than 500 
lats (EUR 711) in monthly revenues. For 57 of the post offices monthly turnover does not exceed 200 lats.
Latvijas Pasts provides mail, philately, transportation, express mail, financial, press and IT services, as well as is 
involved in retail trade. Latvijas Pasts is 100-percent owned by the Latvian state.

- SALES OF LUXURY CARS HAVE SLUMPED IN BALTICS; DEALER HAS SOLD TWO MASERATI AUTOS IN 
2009 SO FAR
Sales of luxury cars have slumped in the Baltics this year, and Modena Motors, the authorized dealer of Maserati 
cars in the Baltics, has sold only two vehicles of the luxury brand this year so far.
Modena Motors head Liga Broka said one car has been sold in Lithuania and the other in Latvia.
In 2008, the dealer sold 16 Maserati cars in the Baltic states, Broka said.
Although the situation in the luxury cars market and the auto market in general is expected to improve as soon as 
banks resume lending, "it largely depends on politics, the moment at which the country stabilizes, as currently the 
economic situation is quite volatile. As soon as banks resume lending, the situation will probably change, as people 
want to buy cars," Broka said, adding that many potential car buyers are turned down by banks that deny them

Passenger traffic through Kaunas International Airport, the second largest in Lithuania, soared by 30 percent, to 
45,500 in July, from 35,000 in July 2008. In January-July, the number of passengers increased by almost 1 percent, 
to 245,000, from 243,000 a year earlier, the airport's CEO Arijandas Sliupas told BNS. He attributed the increase in 
July's figures to the opening of direct flights to Bremen by Ireland's Ryanair from Jul. 1 and robust load factor on the 
route to London. Ryanair currently offers direct flights from Kaunas to London, Dublin, Birmingham, Liverpool, 
Frankfurt and Bremen. Latvia's Airbaltic operates a direct route between Kaunas and Riga. The Kaunas Airport 
expects the passenger traffic, which totaled 410,000 in 2008, to increase by 5 percent this year. Vilnius newsroom,

Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair delayed a flight from Kaunas to London for half a day due to technical snags on 
Tuesday. The aircraft with 172 passengers on board, initially scheduled to depart at 10:20 pm on Tuesday, is now 
expected to take off on Wednesday at 12:05 pm, the Kaunas Airport reported. A bird got sucked into the aircraft's 
engine during landing at Kaunas Airport, Kestutis Auryla, head of Civil Aviation Administration (CAA), told BNS. The 
company was now waiting for Ryanair experts to arrive from London who would decide whether the aircraft was 
safe to continue operations. "No damage has been sustained. It was just a minor disorder in the functioning of the 
engine. Passengers will be taken to London with this or another airplane," Auryla said. The delay in Ryanair flight 
from Lithuania due to technical snags is already the second this year. Last Wednesday the company postponed its 
direct flight from Kaunas to Dublin as the crew noticed prior to the take-off that the sealing of one of the emergency 
exit doors was damaged. Vilnius newsroom, +370 5 2058519, verslas@bns.lt

Technical snags delayed the flight of Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair from Kaunas to Dublin on Wednesday. The 
crew noticed prior to the take-off that the sealing of one of the emergency exit doors was damaged, Kaunas Airport 
CEO Arijandas Sliupas told BNS. "The crew decided not to risk and to have the technicians of the company to 
conduct an inspection and make conclusions. Ryanair does not have any technicians of the required qualifications 
in Lithuania hence the crew had to wait for the specialists to come from London," Sliupas said. Therefore the flight 
scheduled to take off to Dublin at 9:25 pm was delayed till Thursday afternoon. Ryanair, which accounts for about 
99 percent of passenger traffic at Kaunas Airport, currently offers flights from Kaunas to London, Liverpool, Dublin,

When the Riga airport in the Latvian capital introduced its new tariff policy that would not longer offer volume 
discounts, the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair may revise its route network in respect of the flights from Riga, Laszlo 
Tamas, Ryanair Sales and Marketing Manager for the UK and Ireland, told the press on Thursday.
He said that the issue was being discussed with the airline's Route Development Department but so far there aren't 
any specific plans regarding changes in Ryanair flights from Riga.
Tamas said that Ryanair preferred to use low-cost airports and not only the airline but also the airport would benefit 
from the arrangement because the increased passenger flow will raise the airport's revenues.
The new tariff policy of the Riga airport provides for equal lowering of airport fees to all airlines. The airport will stop 
applying the discounts previously granted to certain airlines for the number of passengers flown and will charge all 
airlines the same fees that would be some three times lower than the current fee. The new tariff policy is to be 
introduced on November 1, 2009, and it will be in effect until December 31, 2010.
At present the Riga airport applies the policy of discounted airport fees adopted in 2004. The Latvian Competition 
Council in late 2006 found that this policy was distorting the market and was favorable only to two carriers, Ryanair 
and the Latvian national carrier Airbaltic. There is a court proceeding under way on the subject.
Last year Ryanair served 840,757 passengers at the Riga airport which is 22.8 percent of all passengers served at 
the airport during 2008. These results put Ryanair in the second place among the airlines offering flights from Riga 
after the Latvian national airline Airbaltic which served 53.6 percent of all passengers at the Riga airport last year.
Ryanair started offering flights from Riga in 2004 and now flies from the Latvian capital to 13 destinations in Europe.

The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair plans to serve one million passengers at the Riga airport in the Latvian capital this 
year at a 19 percent growth from 2008, Laszlo Tamas, Ryanair Sales and Marketing Manager for the UK and 
Ireland, told the press on Thursday.
He said that in a way the airline had benefited from the economic crisis because the number of its passengers had 
increased. For economy purposes people were giving up services of expensive airlines and choosing the carriers 
that offered cheaper fares.
The structure of passengers has changed and the number of business passengers on Ryanair flights has increased 
steeply recently, said Tamas.

- LATVIAN PRESIDENT TO PROMULGATE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE RELATED TO BUDGET AMENDMENTS 
AFTER PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
Latvian President Valdis Zatlers will promulgate the legislative package related to amendments to the 2009 national 
budget as soon as the parliament submits it to the State Chancellery which is likely to happen on June 25 
immediately after public holidays on June 22-24, said presidential spokeswoman Ilze Rassa.
The parliament press service told BNS that the legislative package was still being processed at the parliament as 
the minutes of the relevant parliament meeting need to be checked, but would be forwarded to the parliament's 
legal office in the nearest future.
The legislative package is likely to be sent to the president's office on June 25.
The amendments to the 2009 national budget provide for a 500 million lats (EUR 700 mln) reduction of spending, 
including tough measures in the social sphere where old-age and service pensions are to be cut by 10 percent but 
pensions to working pensions will be reduced by 70 percent. Among other things, the budget amendments provide 
also for further salary cuts to the public sector employees.

The Lithuanian Cabinet on Monday put off, for a week, discussing a request from Latvia's air carrier Airbaltic and 
Riga Airport to pay them 247,000 euros in damages. Government Chancellor Deividas Matulionis told BNS that 
discussion on the issue had been postponed because of ongoing consultations with Airbaltic. "Therefore, we do not 
want to hurry with decisions," the official said, admitting that he expected to solve the matter in an amicable way. 
Airbaltic and Riga Airport demand that the Lithuanian government pay them 247,000 euros in damages and, within 
the next six months, open negotiations on this matter under a bilateral investment agreement. Otherwise they 
threaten to go to arbitration. The Latvian companies claim that they have suffered the damages as a result of a 
Lithuanian court order to freeze almost 200 million litas (EUR 58 mln) worth of their assets. The order was issued 
last year at the request of FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines. The Latvian companies also demand that the asset freeze 
should be removed. Airbaltic has put its losses resulting from the asset freeze at approximately 131,000 euros, and 
Riga airport at 116,000 euros. FlyLAL last year took the two Latvian companies to court, claiming that Riga Airport 
provided Airbaltic with discounts that were allegedly discriminatory against other airlines. The Lithuanian airline 
early this year suspended its operations due to financial troubles, but its owners have expressed hope that the 
company's bankruptcy administrator would continue the proceedings. Five carriers pulled out of Riga Airport last 
year. Back in 2006, Latvia's Competition Council ruled that the discounts offered by the airport distorted the market 
and favored two companies -- Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair. (EUR 1 = LTL 3.45) Vilnius newsroom, +370 5

Latvia's air carrier Airbaltic and Riga Airport demand 247,000 euros (LTL 852,800) in damages from the Lithuanian 
government and urge to open negotiations on the matter under a bilateral investment agreement during next six 
months, unofficial BNS sources have said. Otherwise the companies would address the arbitration court. Moreover, 
Airbaltic and Riga airport demand that the seizure of almost 200 million litas (EUR 57.97 mln) in their assets, 
imposed by Lithuanian courts at the request of no longer functioning Lithuanian flagship carrier FlyLAL-Lithuanian 
Airlines, should be recalled. 
Lithuania's government will consider the demands of Latvia's companies at its Monday meeting. Airbaltic has put its 
losses sustained as a result of property seizure at approximately 131,000 euros (LTL 452,300) and Riga airport - at 
116,000 euros (LTL 400,500). Airbaltic shareholders Bertolt Martin Flick and Karl Gunther Sollinger also demand 
the recall of property seizure, which they call a violation of law. FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines launched litigation 
demanding close to 200 million litas in damages sustained by the carrier due to favorable conditions extended by 
Riga Airport to Airbaltic, which, as a result, was able to offer lower prices thus gaining unfair competitive advantage. 
FlyLAL suspended its operations due to financial troubles, yet the owners of the company earlier expressed hope 
that the company's bankruptcy administrator would continue those proceedings. Five carriers pulled out of Riga 
airport in 2008. Back in 2006, Latvia's Competition Council acknowledged that the discounts offered by the airport

from the Routes Europe forum in Prague, which focused on low-cost airlines and regional airports, Sliupas told BNS 
that they had established "a lot of new contacts" and were planning meetings with airlines' representatives to 
discuss possible cooperation. "The winter schedule has been put together already, so we can expect new flights no 
earlier than in the summer season of next year. Agreements with air carriers can be expected in late autumn this 
year," the airport's CEO said. Kaunas Airport has held several meetings with representatives of some Russian 
airlines as well, but the Russians' interest in operating flights to Lithuania is weak, he said. Moscow, Paris, 
Edinburgh and Milan among priority destinations on the airport's expansion list. Ireland's budget airline Ryanair 
currently offers direct flights from Kaunas to London, Dublin, Birmingham, Liverpool and Frankfurt, and is to launch 
direct flights to the German city of Bremen on Jul. 1. Latvia's Airbaltic plans to begin direct flights from Kaunas to

The new discount policy of Riga airport to cut tariffs equally to all airlines is a good decision, the head of the Latvian 
Association of Tourism Agents told BNS.
"If the promise to make out airport one of the cheapest is fulfilled, it will be very good," the association's president 
Kitija Gitendorfa said.
The president of the association noted that the changes in the airport's tariff policy will benefit the tourism industry, 
as it will improve airlines' competitiveness. Furthermore, the new tariffs are expected to lure back some of the 
airlines that have considered quitting operations in Riga.
Gitendorfa noted thought that those airlines that previously enjoyed significant discounts for the number of 
passengers flown could decide to raise air ticket prices for their passengers.
Aigars Smiltans, executive director of Latvia's largest full-service travel agency Latvia Tours, told BNS that the new 
discount policy of Riga airport had both advantages and disadvantages.
"The good thing is that they will facilitate the advent of new airlines and will prompt the existing ones to stay, as the 
airport fee will decrease, but the bad thing is that due to these changes Airbaltic [national carrier] and [Ireland's] 
Ryanair may decide to close some routes," Smiltans explained.
The head of Latvia Tours also voiced concern that the above airlines that used to enjoy big discounts for passenger 
numbers might raise their air ticket prices. At the same time, he noted, the airlines wanted to remain loyal to their 
customers who have booked tickets in advance, so it was not clear yet if air ticket prices would be increased.
The Latvian government on Tuesday endorsed Riga airport's decision to reduce tariffs equally to all airlines.

- LATVIA, CANADA SIGN AGREEMENT ON PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS
Latvian Foreign Minister Maris Riekstins and Canadian Minister of International Trade and Minister for the Asia-
Pacific Gateway, Stockwell Burt Day, Jr., on Tuesday in Riga signed the Latvian-Canadian agreement on promotion 
and protection of investments, reported the Latvian Foreign Ministry.
Riekstins welcomed strengthening of the Latvian-Canadian legal framework regarding investments that was a 
positive signal to business people of both countries.
The Canadian international trade minister said that Latvia was the first of the new EU member states with which 
Canada had signed an agreement that would ensure compliance of existing agreements with the EU acquis.
Both ministers discussed bilateral relations and Riekstins spoke approvingly about development of Latvian-
Canadian relations, underlining that Canada had always support Latvia in its aspirations and had been the first of 
NATO member states to ratify the protocol about Latvia's accession to NATO.
The Latvian foreign minister said that stepping up bilateral economic relations was one of the priorities. At present 
there is ongoing cooperation between the two countries in food industry as well as in the pharmaceutical and textile 
industries. Latvia would also like to cooperate with Canada in development and strengthening of democracy and 
socioeconomic processes among the EU neighbors.
Riekstins and Day also discussed Latvian-Canadian cooperation on the international mission in Afghanistan and the 
Canadian minister conveyed his condolences on deaths of two Latvian soldiers in Afghanistan on May 1.
The Canadian international trade minister made his first visit to Latvia on the way to Prague for the EU-Canada 
summit on May 6 expected to launch negotiations towards a deepened economic partnership agreement.

- PASSENGERS WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR COST INCREASES CAUSED BY RIGA AIRPORT'S NEW TARIFF

Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier expects its costs to rise as a result of Riga airport's new tariff policy, the airline's 
president and CEO Bertold Flick said, adding that passengers will have to pay for the cost increase.
"On the one hand, the new tariffs mean higher costs to Airbaltic airline, which on the part of Riga airport is not a 
welcomed signal to airlines in the circumstances of crisis. On the other hand, the new tariffs reduce insecurity and 
provide clear and comprehensible rules that allow forecasting our costs in the future," Flick said, pointing out that air 
passengers should cover the cost increases that will be caused by the tariff change.
"Speaking about tariffs in general -- Airbaltic would rather support a maximum 80 percent discount to all airlines 
without exceptions," Flick said.

- LATVIAN GOVT ENDORSES RIGA AIRPORT'S DECISION TO CUT TARIFFS EQUALLY TO ALL CARRIERS
The Latvian government on Tuesday endorsed Riga airport's decision to reduce tariffs equally to all airlines.
Under the new tariff policy, the airline will no longer provide discounts to some carriers for the number of 
passengers flown and will charge the same fees from all airlines. Moreover, the fees have been reduced 
approximately threefold.
The Latvian Transport Ministry believes that the new policy will facilitate competition at the airport and create 
preconditions for maintaining the existing and launching new air routes from Riga. The new tariff policy will also 
dispel the concerns of the competition watchdog and state auditors over the legitimacy of the existing discount 
system, the ministry said.
The ministry also pointed out that the new policy would make the content of Riga airport's services more 
comprehensible, as the airport has scrapped aviation security fees and introduced a passenger service fee, among 
other things.
The new provisions will also bring more clarity about the system of payments for the services provided by the 
airport. The airport has also scrapped discounts to carriers for launching new routes.
The new payment system will take effect as of Nov. 1, 2009, and it will remain in force until Dec. 31, 2010.
Latvian Transport Minister Kaspars Gerhards told BNS that the new discount policy had to be developed as the 
Competition Council had found the existing system to be contradiction with Latvian and EU competition laws.
"Secondly, these discounts must be transparent, so that it was clear for what they were offered. The previous 
discounts strongly tended to favor two companies. Thirdly, the airport fee must be low, but high enough to ensure 
the existence of the airport. The solution has been found after considering all these principles. The proposed air 
transportation fees are the lowest in Europe," Gerhards said.
The minister noted that if Riga airport provides the lowest tariffs in Europe it will be a good signal to those airlines 
that have quit Riga or are about to fold their operations there, such as Dutch carrier KLM.
Gerhards noted though that he has not had talks with companies that might return to Riga or start operations there. 
The airport's tariffs have not been discussed with Ireland's low-fares carrier Ryanair, which until now enjoyed the 
greatest discounts. The airport has only talked with representatives of Latvia's Airbaltic national carrier.
In 2006, the Competition Council ruled that the current discount system that has been in force at Riga airport since 
2004 is crippling the market and is favorable to two airlines -- Airbaltic and Ryanair. A legal action is still continuing

- LATVIAN PRESIDENT, CANADIAN TRADE MINISTER DISCUSS CLOSER BILATERAL COOPERATION
Latvian President Valdis Zatlers on Tuesday met with visiting Canadian Minister of International Trade and Minister 
for the Asia-Pacific Gateway, Stockwell Burt Day, Jr., and both officials discussed possibilities for closer 
cooperation between the two countries, reported the Latvian president's press service.
They also discuss the economic situation in Latvia and Canada in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
Speaking about further bilateral economic cooperation, Zatlers and Day agreed that both countries had a great 
potential of yet unused cooperation opportunities.
When discussing development of the Baltic energy market, they said Latvian-Canadian energy cooperation also 
had good future prospects. The Latvian president said that Latvia was interested in North American investments 
and our country could be interesting to Canada as an important link in the West-East transit route.
The Latvian-Canadian agreement on promotion and protection of investments signed in the Latvian Foreign Ministry 
on Tuesday is an important step towards expanding further cooperation, said Zatlers. The new agreement had to be 
signed because the 1995 Latvian-Canadian investment agreement was inconsistent with the EU acquis.

- LATVIAN NATIONAL BUDGET HAS DEFICIT OF EUR 515.6 MLN AT END OF APRIL
The fiscal deficit in the Latvian general government consolidated budget was 362.4 million lats (EUR 515.65 mln) at 
the end of April this year, according to the preliminary budget performance figures provided by the Finance Ministry.
After the first four months in 2008 the Latvian national budget had a surplus of 28.1 million lats.
Revenues to the central government basic budget from January 1 to April 26 this year stood at 906.9 million lats, 
which is 16.8 percent less than during the same period last year. Tax revenues this year had decreased by 24 
percent, including a 30.3 percent decline of corporate income tax, a 30 percent reduction of personal income and a 
28.4 percent reduction of value added tax.
Expenditures under the central government basic budget have grown 2.7 percent year-on-year with current 
expenditure having ben cut by 18.2 percent (including a 19.1 percent reduction for compensation costs).
The central government basic budget has run up a deficit of 296.5 million lats from January 1 to April 26 this year as 
compared to a deficit of 82.5 million lats after the same period in 2008.
The central government special budget had a deficit of 65.9 million lats at the end of April this year as opposed to a 
110.4 million surplus during the same period last year.
The budget deficit in 2009 is planned at 705.7 million lats or 4.7 percent of GDP but the Latvian government is 
working on the budget amendments under which the deficit is projected at 7 percent of GDP. The current 2009 
budget is based on a 5 percent contraction of GDP but the latest estimates suggest a 12-13 percent decline in the 
Latvian economy.

- DECLINE IN LATVIAN INDUSTRY BEGINS TO STABILIZE, BUT NO IMPROVEMENT LIKELY SOON - 
ANALYSTS
Although the current decline in Latvia's industrial output appears to be stabilizing, no improvement is being 
expected anytime soon, bank analysts told BNS commenting the latest industrial output figures.
"Output in the manufacturing industry has been dropping steeply over the whole last year, but there have been no 
sharp changes anymore since January. I think that production will no longer decrease substantially and losses in 
one area will be compensated by profits in another," said Peteris Strautins, a social economics expert at Latvia's 
Swedbank, predicting that year-on-year data will improve in the course of 2009.
The expert added that there was not really any reason to be happy about, as output in the manufacturing industry 
has slipped 20 percent below the level of 2005. "Since the manufacturing industry is the main export sector, and a 
resumption of economic growth is impossible without export development, ultimately Latvia's life standards will 
depend on the success of the manufacturing industry," Strautins said.
The Swedbank expert noted that the external environment was still unfavorable, but it was no longer deteriorating 
fast, and demand for Latvian exports was no longer decreasing as quickly as before.
"At the end of 2008 and the beginning of this year a swift correction of provisions took place -- concerned about 
their future, companies improved their liquidity, reducing stocks and raising monetary provisions. This cycle is over, 
and the restoration of stocks has begun. It seems that household demand has stabilized in the US and consumers' 
mood has started improving both in America and the EU," Strautins said.
In his words, output in the manufacturing industry can be driven by two factors -- the activation of cyclical idle-
standing factors and investments in production volumes and quality.
Dainis Gaspuitis, a macroeconomics expert at Latvia's SEB Banka, told BNS that industrial production in Latvia saw 
a steep drop in the first quarter due to two usual factors, namely, price decreases and contraction of external 
markets. Delays with launching business support measures also caused complications.
"In March, the annual decline in industrial output was smaller than in February. It might suggest that the decline 
might start to stabilize. But it is premature yet to make such conclusions. Domestic consumption continues to 
plummet and exports are decreasing as well. It means that the situation in industrial production will not get better 
anytime soon and is rather likely to keep deteriorating. Since the situation in the domestic market will improve more 
gradually than in other markets the further recovery of the sector may happen thanks to export growth. To ensure 
this, it is necessary to actively work on the restoration of competitiveness and to launch efficient support measures 
at last," Gaspuitis said.
The SEB Banka analyst added that for the time being signs of recovery in external markets were rather vague and 
could become more pronounced by the end of the year. Latvia's industrial output, therefore, is likely to drop further 
in the second quarter of this year.
"In the second half of the year, if export and other support measures are launched successfully, external markets 
will show signs of recovery, and if our industrialists have worked on restoring competitiveness, the decline will begin 
to stabilize. The improvement trend will be very slow, as purchasing power will be limited in the nearest future, while 
price increases will be moderate and competition stiff. To make the planned profit, companies will have to focus on 
efficiency at the expense of volume, relying less on price hikes," Gaspuitis said.
Industrial output in Latvia in the first quarter of this year fell 23.2 percent from the same period last year, reported 
the national statistics office. Output dropped 24.6 percent in the manufacturing industry and 12.3 percent in power 
and gas supply while there was 2.2 percent growth in mining and quarrying.

- LATVIAN BANK EQUIPMENT WHOLESALER HANSAB SLIPS INTO RED AFTER 2008, SALES DROP 8 PCT 
TO EUR 5 MLN
The bank equipment wholesaler Hansab last year generated 3.554 million lats (EUR 5.057 mln) in sales at an 8 
percent drop year-on-year and closed the year 2008 with a loss of 113,500 lats as opposed to profit in 2007, 
according to the annual financial statements published in the Latvian business register database.
The company's management said in its report that Hansab had incurred loss in 2008 because it had been unable to 
increase revenues while costs had increased in view of the current economic situation. "The loss was partly due 
also to failures on behalf on the company's management which resulted in an agreement on replacement of the 
management in 2009," the report reads.
In order to improve its financial results the company expanded its range of customers, focusing on public and 
municipal authorities, retail chains, construction companies and medical establishments and launching advertising 
campaign.
Hansab also sought to expand its maintenance service business. "The turnover from services kept growing steadily 
in 2008, rising 22.6 percent, which is an important factor to ensure the company's stability in the difficult economic 
conditions this year," Hansab management said in its report.
In 2008 the company started offering new products on the Latvian market -- electronic price tags, anti-theft devices 
for ATMs, wholesale of self-service check-out counters and reverse vending machines for empty beverage 
containers.
Speaking about Hansab operations this year, the management said it was certain the company would be able to 
overcome economic difficulties and to achieve better results than in 2008. The company would start offering new 
types of maintenance services, launch a marketing campaign and open a new website.
Hansab said it was a leading provider in distribution and maintenance of bank equipment, being the only company 
in Latvia to offer a full range of bank equipment from cash registers to ATMs.
In 2007, Hansab posted a turnover of 3.874 million lats and earned a profit of 142,100 lats.
Hansab is fully owned by the Estonian company Osauhing Hansab Group which has been operating in the Baltic 
states for more than 15 years.

The new tariff policy of Riga airport no longer includes discounts to airlines for the number of passengers flown, 
said Riga airport CEO Krisjanis Peters.
The airport's new tariff policy, Peters said, was based on three cornerstones -- the airport had to reach an 
agreement on its new tariff policy with the Competition Council, the airport had to operate without losses and make 
sure that the tariffs are also approved by its biggest clients.
"We have been working on several tariff plans, we have agreed them with the Competition Council, so the key 
principle is that there are no discounts," Peters said. The head of the airport informed BNS that the airport's council 
has chosen one of the redrafted tariff plans and the Transport Ministry is due to submit it to the government for 
approval.
Peters noted that the airlines operating in at Riga airport have been informed about the changes in the tariff policy. 
"Since these new tariffs have been significantly lowered for those companies that did not receive the discounts and 
increased for these companies [Latvia's Airbaltic and Ireland's Ryanair that enjoyed the discounts], none of the [big 
clients] is applauding of course," Peters admitted.
The Riga airport CEO also said there was always a possibility of Ireland's Ryanair low-fares carrier leaving Riga 
airport. "This possibility is always there, we have not been told this officially," he said.
Peters said the new tariff policy might help Riga airport to attract new airlines. The arrival of new airlines in Latvia, 
however, would depend on the policy of these companies, namely, whether they are planning transit routes. If they 
had no such plans, the Latvian market would not be very attractive to them given the low purchasing power of local 
residents and the decreased domestic market, the head of the airport explained.
RIGA AIRPORT SCRAPS DISCOUNTS TO AIRLINES FOR PASSENGER NUMBERS - CEO
Riga airport spokesman Martins Langrats told BNS earlier that the airport had worked out and submitted to the 
Transport Ministry draft amendments to government provisions regulating the airport's tariff policy that would 
provide for lower airport fees and changes in the discount system. The new fees are expected to take effect from 
Nov 1, 2009, to Dec. 31, 2010.
The government is scheduled to consider the airport's new tariff policy on Tuesday, May 5.
In 2006, the Competition Council ruled that the current discount system that has been in force at Riga airport since 
2004 is crippling the market and is favorable to two airlines -- Airbaltic and Ryanair. A legal action is still continuing 
over the issue.
Riga is the largest Baltic airport by passenger numbers and a state-owned company.

- LATVIAN RETAIL SALES TO DROP 25 PCT IN Q1 - ANALYSTS
Latvian retail sales in the first quarter of this year has dropped by 25 percent, said banking analysts.
"No significant changes in retail sales should be expected in March. Consumption will continue a rapid drop, which 
might be about 25-28 percent," said SEB Banka macroeconomic expert Dainis Gaspuitis.
He said that fuel consumption might bring slight changes, softening the general drop. "However, decline in fuel 
consumption might be around 20 percent," he said.
Retail sales in the first quarter will generally drop by 25 percent. "Consumers are still cautious, their income will 
decline. Emphasis is put on purchase of essential goods, thus, food products sales will decline slower than sales of 
non-food products. However, we should take into account the popularity of direct sale of food products, which 
means that these resources disappear from turnover of stores, but their amount is hard to predict," he said.
Latvia's Swedbank senior economic Dainis Stikuts told BNS that development of retail sales is difficult to be 
forecast, especially in a month, but the annual drop might be about 25 percent.
"Sale of long-term and exclusive goods has definitely dropped over a month, but sales of food products might see a 
certain stabilization. In March consumers' mood is also stabilizing, but the wish to make serious purchases is still 
decreasing," he said.
The national statistics office will publish first quarter retail sales data on Apr. 30.
Sales by Latvian retail companies in February this year fell 25.3 percent in constant prices from the same month in 
2008 to 288 million lats (EUR 410 mln). Latvian retail sales minus car gasoline sales came to 241.2 million lats in 
February 2009.
Year-on-year, retail sales of non-food products in February this year dropped most steeply -- by 29.4 percent while 
retail sales of food products decreased by 16.6 percent.

The Latvian government will review the new discount policies of the Riga airport next week, said Transport Minister 
Kaspars Gerhards.
He told BNS that he expected to receive the resolution of the airport council about applying the same discounts to 
all airlines operating in the Riga port on Tuesday or Wednesday. The transport minister will then sign the resolution 
so that it could be put before the Cabinet next week.
The Latvian daily Diena reported on Tuesday that the Riga airport council had on Monday decided to drop the 
current system of discounts on airport fees that was distorting the market as it was favorable only to two carriers, 
the Latvian national carrier Airbaltic and the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. Instead the airport's council would 
propose to the government to introduce equally low "crisis-time fees" for all airlines.
Participants of the council meeting told the newspaper that the new fees would make the Riga airport services the 
cheapest of their kind in Northern Europe. The new airport fees will be twice as low as the current fees -- "some 3-4 
euros per passenger", said Baiba Broka, council chairwoman of the Riga airport. It is planned that the new rates 
would take effect in November and would apply for a year. Then the new rates would be assessed for their effects.
At present the Riga airport applies the policy of discounted airport fees adopted in 2004. The Latvian Competition 
Council in late 2006 found that this policy was distorting the market and was favorable only to two carriers, the 
Latvian national carrier Airbaltic and the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. There is a court proceeding under way on the 
subject.
The state-owned Riga international airport is the largest airport in the Baltic states in terms of passengers.

- BITE LATVIJA MOBILE OPERATOR MIGHT BREAK INTO BLACK IN 2010
Bite Latvija mobile operator might break into black in 2010, said Bite group financial director Martin Amtoft-
Christensen.
"We are nearing the line when we will earn profit, but it will not happen by bthe end of this year," he said, adding 
that the company is attracting customers at present and it requires large investments, therefore there is no profit.
According to Amtoft-Christensen, the company might earn profit in 2010, but possibly there might be profit also in 
some quarter before that.
He said that the company does not expect to earn profit before 2010 because it is still investing in development. 
Expenditures in formation of network, brand, customer attraction are "good expenses" and they will ensure a strong 
network in the future.
According to the company representative, the number of Bite Latvija subscription customers rose by 51 percent in a 
year, while the number of pre-paid service customers increased by 61 percent.
Bite Latvia mobile operator saw its revenues grow by more than 50 percent year-on-year to 4.9 million lats (EUR 
6.97 mln) in the first quarter of 2009. The operator's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization 
(EBITDA) were negative -- -2.3 million lats. The company closed 2008 with 15.142 million lats in the red, while its 
net sales were 16.008 million lats.
Bite Latvia started its operations in Latvia in September 2005, as its owners Bite Lietuva purchased at an auction 
the third license for providing GSM/UMTS mobile telecommunications services in Latvia. The Bite group comprises 
Bite Lietuva and Bite Latvija. The group belongs to Mid Europa Partners equity fund.

Ireland's budget airline Ryanair last year carried 409,000 passengers to and from Kaunas International Airport in 
Lithuania, a rise of 4.7 percent year-on-year. Ryanair, which began flights to Lithuania's second-biggest city several 
years ago, has reached its 1 millionth passenger mark at the airport. Kaunas Airport CEO Arijandas Sliupas told 
BNS that the Irish airline would resume flights to Liverpool in late March. "There are possibilities for increasing the 
offer of flights. Several new directions are being analyzed, but everything will depend on the general economic 
situation," the airport's CEO said. "Ryanair is a low-fare airline that uses all resources. It would not offer a new 
direction until after careful consideration," he said. This year Kaunas Airport expects to achieve last year's growth 
rate of around 5 percent. But if Ryanair launched a new route, the total number of passengers at the airport could 
rise by an estimated 50,000 annually, Sliupas said. Ryanair, which holds roughly 99 percent of the passenger 
market at Kaunas Airport, currently offers direct flights from Lithuania to London (Luton and Stansted), Dublin,

Passenger traffic at Kaunas International Airport, the second largest in Lithuania, increased by 5 percent, year-on-
year, to record 410,000 in 2008. The airport is mulling expansion and hopes to get contributions from private 
investors. Still, the airport admitted in a statement that complicated economic environment affected the flow of 
transit freight, which plunged by 50 percent in the reporting period. The route to London - the most popular at the 
airport - was taken by 185,000 passengers last year or 45 percent of overall passenger traffic. Irish budget carrier 
Ryanair offers flights from Kaunas to London Stansted and Luton airports as well as to Birmingham. In spring the 
company will resume flights to Liverpool. The airport signed a cooperation agreement with La Centrale Airport 
Group in the fall of 2008. Vilnius newsroom, +370 5 2058518, verslas@bns.lt

Irish no-frill carrier Ryanair aims to double the number of flights between Kaunas, the second largest Lithuania's 
city, and London from the spring of 2009. The company would offer two daily flights between Kaunas and London 
Stansted airport starting from Mar. 5, 2009, the carrier said in a statement. "The success of this route is the result of 
strong ties between Lithuania and the UK, Ryanair's guarantee of the lowest price and punctuality of flights," 
Ryanair representative John Booty said. The flights offered by the Irish company from Kaunas to London airports of 
Luton and Stansted were the most popular destination in the second largest Lithuania's city, Arijandas Sliupas, 
CEO of Kaunas International Airport, said. "We see the number of passengers taking this route exceeding 180,000 
by the end of 2008," the statement quoted Sliupas as saying. Ryanair, which claims to be the largest budget carrier 
in Europe, operates more than 800 routes. The company expects to have at least 195 Boeing 737-800s by March of 
2009 and aims to expand the fleet by 70 aircraft in four years. Vilnius newsroom, +370 5 2058519, verslas@bns.lt

Riga international airport has decided to postpone its plans on construction of a terminal for low-cost airlines till the 
summer season schedule is ready, said the airport.
Airport's board chairman Krisjanis Peters told BNS: "At present we have made a decision not to build the low-cost 
terminal -- we should see what happens when the summer season comes."
He said that the terminal is planned to be built for low-cost and charter flights, but at present there is only one low-
cost airline -- Irish Ryanair -- and one charter flights company -- SmartLynk-Latcharter -- operating in Riga, which is 
not enough to build a special terminal.
Peters said earlier that in the summer season of 2009 Riga airport could have low-fare airline terminal allowing to 
separate the passenger flows of low-fare airlines from full service airline customers.
The airport had announced a tender for construction of the low-cost terminal, but it ended with no results as the 
submitted proposals had various interpretations of the technical criteria which could interfere with the passenger 
and cargo service and might cause additional costs during the construction. There were six applicants to the tender. 
The winner of the competition had to complete construction by May 31, 2009.
German low-cost airlines EasyJet and Germanwings stopped their flights from Riga airport in winter 2008-09. 
According to the airport, the companies have left Riga just for the winter season.
International airport Riga is fully owned by Latvian state and the largest Baltic airport by passenger numbers.

Even though several low-cost airlines have stopped their flights to Riga in the winter season, AerLingus, Easyjet 
and Germanwings plan to resume their flights to Riga in summer, said Riga airport board chairman Krisjanis Peters 
in an interview with BNS.
"Several airlines have left us. We are sorry about this situation. From July 31 flights have been stopped by SAS, 
Armavia, but Armavia has handed its flights to Airbaltic. FlyLal has left Riga with a loud scandal on unsettled debts. 
AerLingus, Easyjet and Germanwings have left the airport. However, all of them, apart from FlyLal, plan to return to 
Riga in the summer season," he said.
Meanwhile, Peters said that, taking into account the crisis in the air transportation industry, companies will still 
assess whether to resume flights to Riga. "In any way, we will see, but I believe that half of these companies will 
return to Riga," he said.
Peters said that, even though many companies have left the airport for the winter season, this year the airport offers 
60 direct flights as compared to 50 flights last year.
He said that this winter Airbaltic will fly daily to Amsterdam, competing with KLM. Airbaltic is launching flights to 
Dubai, five times a week there will be flights to Hannover, two times a day to Tampere. The number of flights to 
Munich has been raised by one. Meanwhile, Ryanair has launched flights to Brussels and Dusseldorf, Larcharter or 
Smart Lynx will fly to Hurghada, Tenerife and Sharm-el-Sheikh.
Riga airport is a state-owned company.

whether Latvia's Airbaltic intends to keep the route, yet the company is no longer selling tickets to Dublin for its 
winter season months. "We have not abandoned that route completely, it is just a temporary measure, which has 
been taken considering the general market demand in flights and as part of efforts to streamline the company's 
operations," Liutauras Tarabrinas, deputy director of FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines's development department, told the

Irish Low-cost airline Ryanair on May 25 will close its flights from Riga to Irish city of Shannon, said Latvia's 
Russian language business daily Bizness & Baltija on Wednesday.
Ryanair manager in Northern Europe Wilhelm Hamilton told the daily that this summer Ryanair will fly to 11 cities 
from Riga -- Bremen, Bristol, Dublin, East Midlands, Frankfurt, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Stockholm, Tampere 
and Milan. Flights to Shannon will be closed as they are bringing losses.
"The main condition of our business is a large turnover of passengers on each route. Planes between Riga and 
Shannon were loaded only by one third. The number of customers a week on the route equalled the number of 
passengers on Riga-London route every day," said Hamilton.
Ryanair launched flights between Riga and Shannon last November.
According to data by Riga airport, 9,085 passengers were served on Riga-Shannon route in the first four months of 
this year, which is 1 percent of all passengers served at the airport. Ryanair in January-April served a total of 
263,622 passengers at Riga airport or 26.5 percent of all passengers served in Riga, which is the second largest 
market share after Latvian national carrier Airbaltic.

In the first quarter of 2008, Riga airport remained the leader among Baltic airports in terms of passenger numbers, 
and was considerably behind Tallinn airport by cargo turnover, the spokesman for Riga airport Martins Langrats told 
BNS.
He said that joining to the Schengen zone and lifting of border control will enable the airport to considerably raise 
the number of transit passengers. According to the airport estimates, it could grow two times.

the same period of 2006, Langrats said. He informed that the number of transit passengers doubled over a year 
and in January-March Riga was used as a transit airport by 44,700 passengers. Transit passengers make up 6.2 
percent of the total passenger number.
In March, Riga airport raised passenger numbers by 20.2 percent from the same month in 2007 to 266,000 people, 
Tallinn came second with a 9.9 percent rise to 152,100 people and Vilnius was third with 160,400 passengers, up 
38.4 percent on year.
Riga lead the Baltic airports by the number of served flights as well, as it grew by 21.4 percent over the past year to 
11,800 in the first quarter of 2008. Tallinn raised the number of flights by 23.9 percent to 9,600 and the number of 
flights to and from Vilnius airport increased by 26.7 percent from the first quarter of 2007 to 8,700 flights.
Tallinn led other Baltic airports by the amount of cargos served, with cargo turnover at the Estonian airport reaching 
8,900 tons, which is 238.1 percent more than in the first quarter of 2007. Riga airport followed with a cargo turnover 
dwindling by 13 percent to 1,700 tons, and in Vilnius cargo throughput went up 0.1 percent to 1,400 tons.
In 2007, Riga airport served 3.161 million passengers, up 26.7 percent from 2006. Tallinn airport served 1,7 million 
people at a 12 percent rise on year, and Vilnius airport increased the number of passengers by 18.3 percent to 1.7

In a sign of a price war among air carriers in Lithuania, Ireland's budget airline Ryanair has blasted Latvia's Airbaltic 
for raising what it called the "rip-off" fuel surcharge. "Ryanair remains the only airline which promises not to impose 
fuel surcharges even if the fuel price hits 200 US dollars per barrel. Airbaltic is ripping off passengers with its fuel 
surcharge," said Wilhelm Hamilton, Ryanair's manager for Northern Europe, said in a statement on Thursday. The 
Irish airline operates flights to Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas. Airbaltic increased its fares earlier this 
month, citing rising fuel costs. The fuel surcharge per one-way ticket now is 17 litas (EUR 4.93 mln) if purchased 
online and 31 litas if purchased from a travel agency.

Lithuania's flagship carrier FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines expects to overcome its Latvia's rival Airbaltic at the 
International Vilnius Airport in February as a result of changes in pricing and price reduction. The Lithuanian 
company, which seeks to restore the lead at the Vilnius airport this year, maintains robust outlook for 2008 despite 
prospects of economic slowdown. "We do not have the final figures as yet. However, based on provisional data, the 
number of passengers who took our flights from Vilnius was smaller than that of Airbaltic by approximately 1,000 in 
January. We may well overcome them [Latvia's carrier] in February," FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines CEO Tadas Puksta 
told the reporters on Thursday. Ticket prices for the summer season of this year were some 10-15 percent lower 
compared with the year-earlier, he added. "We seek to be a carrier "of no surprises" for our customers, we do not 
intend to cover any additional charges. We have entered the cheap tickets segment successfully and now we see 
that the prices we offer are more attractive both compared with Airbaltic and Irish budget carrier Ryanair," Puksta 
said. Vilnius newsroom, +370 5 2058518, verslas@bns.lt

If Latvian national carrier Airbaltic wants to compete successfully, it has to upgrade its fleet, which might cost more 
than a billion, not specifying the currency, said Latvian Transport Minister Ainars Slesers in an interview with BNS.
"Airbaltic's old fleet is a large problem and to replace the whole fleet, we have to speak about astronomic 
investments. If Airbaltic wants to compete successfully, new planes have to be bought, the fleet should be replaced 
and it might cost over a billion," said the minister.
He said that so far Airbaltic was competing successfully, but increase of expenses and the out-dated air fleet might 
cause problems to the company. "Currently they are competing successfully, they have increase of turnovers, but 
with oil prices rising, expenses will grow and there is trouble," said the minister, adding that the old fleet is the 
largest problem, passengers are complaining, but it cannot be upgraded rapidly.
Slesers said, if the company wants to offer quality service, it has to fly large planes, but gradual replacement of 
Airbaltic's fleet will not increase its power. "Of course, they can replace plane by plane, but to keep above the water, 
they have to replace the whole fleet. If they want quality and service, they should fly large planes. Before 
competition grew, they could afford small planes, but in routes with Ryanair flying large planes, the small ones are 
not a competition. How can you compete with 50 seats, if there is a giant with 189 seats," said the minister.
He said that there are routes, where the small planes could do, but these are not significant routes. The main 
destinations -- London, Frankfurt, Berlin, Dublin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki and other capitals -- should be 
served with large planes. "It is the only opportunity to ensure rapid growth and decline of prices. That is the only 
way to reduce expenses as pilots and crew will not work for half-prices," he said.
UPGRADE OF AIRBALTIC CARRIER FLEET MIGHT COST MORE THAN BILLION - LATVIAN TRANSPORT 
MINISTER
Slesers said that Airbaltic is concerned about opening of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair's base in Riga. Airbaltic 
cannot be compared to Ryanair who has a long-term agreement about supply of Boeing planes. Ryanair receives 
new planes every week. The average age of Airbaltic's planes are over ten years, while Ryanair's planes are about 
three years old. It can reduce expenses as the airplanes need minimum repairs, said the minister, being sure that 
Ryanair will open its base in Riga this year.
According to Airbaltic Internet website, the company owns 21 planes, including ten Boeing 737-500, three Boeing 
737-300, and eight Fokker 50 planes. Soon the company plans to hold a press conference, informing about its 
plans to invest several hundreds of millions of US dollars in expanding its fleet.
Airbaltic, founded in 1995, is 52.6 percent owned by the Latvian state and 47.2 percent owned by Scandinavian 
SAS. Airbaltic serves direct routes from two Baltic capitals Riga and Vilnius, direct flights between Russia's 
Kaliningrad and Denmark's Copenhagen, Latvia's Liepaja and Germany's Hamburg, as well as Liepaja and 
Copenhagen. Last year Airbaltic carried 2.007 million passengers, up 41 percent year-on-year.

A Boeing plane of Irish no-frill carrier Ryanair skidded off the runway at the Kaunas International Airport, the second 
largest in Lithuania, on Friday night. Aviation experts doubt whether the incident was the result of sleet and freezing 
rain since the runway was kept in due order. "The friction coefficient was normal. The aircraft tried to turn around at 
the end of the runway, perhaps the pilot made a mistake by choosing a too large turnaround radius. On the other 
hand, there could have been strips of ice somewhere at the edge. It is quite difficult to specify the reason of this 
technical incident now," Alvydas Sumskas, deputy director of Civil Aviation Administration, told BNS. With one 
wheel of the landing gear off the runway, the pilot asked for the aircraft to be towed, Sumskas added. There were 
no injuries or technical damage, he said. Later that night the plane left for Dublin. Vilnius newsroom, +370 5

In March 2008, Tallinn Airport is about to cut roughly 10 percent off the airport fees charged by the state-owned 
airport company, the daily Eesti Paevaleht reported.
Marketing Director Eduard Tuur said that the company also is planning to review the passenger facility charge 
component of airport fees. Currently the size of the passenger component is 9.9 euros per passenger.
Following the cut, the airport of Tallinn will rank among the airports charging medium-size fees in Europe. So far 
Tallinn has been in the upper price range, and has been losing positions to Riga as a result.
"Right now active exchanges of information are taking place with three to five airlines that are close to flying to 
Tallinn," Tuur said.
Eesti Paevaleht has previously reported that lower fees are an important prerequisite for Ryanair's launching flights 
to the Estonian capital.
The lower fees would also have a positive effect on the prices of air tickets for passengers, the paper said.

The Irish no-frills airline Ryanair's interest in launching flights to Tallinn is not waning and the talks between the

The assistant minister at the Ministry of Economy and Communications, Siim-Valmar Kiisler, met on Tuesday with 
Ryanair Vice President Michael Cawley. The Ryanair official stated continued interest in Tallinn, Kiisler told BNS.
He said the key problem is the fees of the Tallinn airport but the parties are making efforts to solve the problem. As 
far as conditions are concerned, it is in the first place the management of the airport that must have its say, the 
minister added.
The state started negotiations with Ryanair when Edgar Savisaar held the economy portfolio. The parties planned 
to sign also a protocol of intent serving as the basis for a bilateral agreement.
Ryanair is operating out of the Riga, Kaunas and Tampere airports, among others.

The Riga airport plans to open about ten new routes this year and next year, reported the airport.
Riga airport spokesman Martins Langrats said that the new routes will be launched by Latvian national carrier 
Airbaltic, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and British low-cost airline Easyjet.
Airbaltic spokesman Janis Vanags told BNS that the company has not yet decided how many routes will be opened 
and to what destinations, but it is sure that there will be new routes.
The new routes will be launched to Europe or close to Europe as Airbaltic does not have yet planes for inter-
continental flights, said Vanags.
In Vanags' words, Airbaltic next year plans to purchase four new Boeing 373-500 planes with almost 150 seats. The 
new planes will allow the company to increase capacity and open new flights.
The Riga airport this year has served two million passengers and plans to serve 3.1 million people in the whole 
2007.
Latvian Transport Minister Ainars Slesers said earlier that the number of passengers served by the airport will grow 
another 30 percent next year.
In 2006, the Riga airport served 2.495 million passengers or 32.9 percent more than the year before. Riga is the 
largest airport in the Baltics by passengers.
The Riga airport is owned by the Latvian state.

Latvian Transport Minister Ainars Slesers does not exclude the possibility that Ireland's Ryanair low-costs airline will 
become the largest airline operating at Riga airport, adding that this will depend on the strategy chosen by current 
leader -- Latvia's Airbaltic carrier.
"I do not deny that Ryanair could become the largest airline here in the future as this will depend on how 
aggressively Airbaltic will develop its business and how will Ryanair operate. But I think that Ryanair could reach in 
Riga what they have reached in Dublin," Slesers told BNS, adding that Ryanair has almost 75 direct flights from 
Dublin.
Slesers added that, although it has not been explicitly stated, there are talks that Ryanair will develop the company 
base in Latvia, thus, increasing the number of flights.
Ryanair has larger aircraft. Ryanair has long-term agreement on delivery of new airplanes from Boeing. They will 
receive new airplanes with 189 seats. This will cause serious problems to Airbaltic. I think Ryanair could operate as 
many flights from Riga as it operates from Dublin," said the minister.
Slesers added that his task as a minister is to provide for a higher competition in the air transport industry. "It does 
not matter how much the airlines will earn, it is important how much will earn the state. It is important for me to 
ensure that Latvian residents, both tourists and businessmen could travel to and from Latvia for the cheapest price. 
To ensure that there are as many direct flights from and to Riga as possible. We will work on launching flights to 
small towns as well. It is important for the airport to become the largest one," he said.
The airport data show that Airbaltic and Ryanair served the largest number of passengers to and from Riga airport 
in the first seven months of 2007, amounting to 44 percent and 26 percent of all passengers respectively. The

market share of Latvian carrier has increased by 3.8 percentage points, while Ryanair's share has declined by 0.5 
percentage points.
Ryanair management said that it could open the base in Riga, when the number of the passengers serviced by 
Ryanair from Riga reaches 2.5-3 million people. Thus the construction of Ryanair's base is contingent on the 
development of the airport. The investment of Ryanair in its base could amount to 300 million US dollars. Ryanair 
has 19 base airports in Europe. It does not have any bases in Poland and the Baltic states.
Ryanair started its operations in Latvia on October 31, 2004. Now the company operates eight flights from Riga 
airport to Stockholm in Sweden, London and Liverpool in the UK, Frankfurt and Bremen in Germany, Tampere in 
Finland, Dublin in Ireland and Glasgow in Scotland. The company announced that new flights to Milan in Italy and 
East Midlands and Bristol in the UK and Shannon in Ireland would be launched in 2007 and 2008.
Ryanair has flown more than 1.5 million passengers on its Latvian routes since launching passenger services from 
the Latvian capital Riga until July 2007.

A drunk British national assaulted a stewardess on a Ryanair flight from London to Riga and continued violent 
behaviour in the Riga airport where the hooligan was fined by the police, according to Latvian daily Neatkariga.
Police detained two British nationals, aged 29 and 25, who arrived to Riga from London for causing disturbances in 
the Riga airport. The medical tests showed more than three per mille of alcohol their bodies.
The daily reports that one of the detained, being heavily drunk had caused disturbances already in the passenger 
area of the aircraft and when the stewardess came to ask what was wrong, he punched her several times in the 
face and stomach.
Inita Dzelme, the spokeswoman for Riga county police department confirmed that the police had received 
information from the airport about the problems on Ryanair flight. The police detained the British nationals, drafted 
an administrative offence protocol for petty hooliganism and fined them.
"The plane that carried both British nationals does not belong to Latvia, that is why what happened in the plane 
does not concern us, it is not Latvian jurisdiction. That is why we did not try to find out what exactly happened in the 
plane," said Dzelme. After the detention both men were released and the police does not possess any information 
about their further adventures.
There is no official data on the incident at the disposal of the airport, but the airline Ryanair canceled its flight to 
Glasgow in the evening, which involved the same plane and crew, that fought drunk British tourists.
The daily was unable to contact Ryanair representatives on Monday evening.
HEAVILY DRUNK BRITISH NATIONAL BRUTALLY ASSAULTS STEWARDESS ON LONDON-RIGA FLIGHT 
- DAILY
The daily reminds that the behaviour of British tourists is especially "magnificent".
In the evening of March 16, the police detained a 29-year old British national who was urinating in a square by the 
Freedom Monument. In November last year a 30-year old British citizen was similarly detained for peeing on the 
Freedom Monument.
Several tourists have tried to climb the monument. The last incident involved an international group of two 
Norwegian nationals and one Polish national. The climbers were not sober.
The British Embassy in Riga following the performance of the British tourists has launched an information campaign 
Responsible Tourism urging British citizens to rest wisely and observe the law. The embassy recommends to use 
beer glass pads with educatory advice written on them in Old Riga bars. The information glass pads, though, have 
not been seen in the bars frequented by westerners yet.

Ireland's budget airline Ryanair is set to end its four-days-a-week service between Stockholm's Skavsta airport and 
Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas in late May, the Lietuvos Rytas daily reported.
It quoted Kaunas Airport Director Kestutis Cucenas as saying that Ryanair gave no explanation for its decision to 
discontinue flights, but the most probable reason was that passenger numbers on the route were too low.
He confirmed that Kaunas Airport was in talks with several other foreign air carriers, including the Scandinavian 
airline SAS, for reopening the Stockholm-Kaunas route in the summer,

The Irish no frills airline Ryanair has not yet signed the protocol of intent on the opening of air routes from Tallinn 
and wants to continue talks over prices.
Anu Hallik-Jurgenstein, head of the public relations department at the Economic Affairs Ministry, told BNS that the 
company had called time off but talks would continue.
The protocol of intent to be signed by the Estonian government, which largely contains points to be reflected in the 
contract, including the framework of flights and price mechanisms, is the precondition for the signing of a bilateral 
base agreement.
It appears from the protocol that no price differences will be given to Ryanair compared with other aircraft but a 
cheap flights terminal corresponding to Ryanair's price level would be installed.
According to preliminary plans' the protocol of intent was to receive signatures of the Ryanair board at the 
beginning of this week.
The Economic Affairs Ministry and Ryanair have earlier discussed the potential flights. The likely destinations 
include London, Dublin, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Verona and Milan.

Estonia's Ministry of Economy and Communications and the Irish budget carrier Ryanair will next week sign a 
protocol of intent stipulating among other things the construction of a low-cost flights terminal.
The protocol prepares the ground for a bilateral main agreement, including a large part of its provisions such as a 
flying framework and price mechanisms, the ministry said.
It follows from the protocol that Ryanair will not get any price advantages in comparison with other airlines but a 
low-cost flights terminal in line with Ryanair's price levels will be built.
The board of Ryanair is expected to sign the document on Monday after which it will be sent to the Estonian side.
At a meeting of Estonian officials and representatives of Ryanair the parties discussed potential opening of new 
lines. Among possible destinations are London, Dublin, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Bremen, Duesseldorf, Verona and 
Milan, to name some.
At present budget carriers Easyjet, Norwegian and FlyNordic are offering flights out of Tallinn.

LATVIA 'S AIRBALTIC NOT TO INCREASE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS FROM RIGA TO LONDON THIS YEAR

LATVIA'S AIRBALTIC NOT TO INCREASE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS FROM RIGA

Latvian national airline Airbaltic would like to increase the number of its flights from Riga to London, as from the end 
of March the company British Airways will no longer perform flights on the route, but it will not be able to do it, 
Airbaltic's president Bertolt Flick told the press on Wednesday.
At the end of 2006, when British Airways had suddenly announced about its plans to cancel its flights on the route 
Riga-London, Airbaltic's plans to open nine new routes and to increase the number of flights on the 15 existing 
routes had been finalized, Flick said.
Therefore the only thing Airbaltic can now do to meet the demand on the route Riga-London is to use larger aircraft 
on the mentioned route. If last year the airline used for the flights 120-seat planes, this year it will use the ones with 
150 seats, but, of course, the planes will still be full, Flick said.
According to Flick, British Airways has left the international airport Riga, as it was unable to compete neither with 
the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, nor with Airbaltic. The British airline is experiencing similar problems in other 
European airports as well, since on the routes lasting two to three hours passengers normally prefer cheaper flights 
with a lower level of comfort.
In the early November 2006 British Airways announced that on March 25, 2007 it would discontinue direct flights 
from Riga to London, which it used to perform seven times a week.
London is the most popular destination among other flights from Riga. Last year British Airways had carried 82,000 
passengers on the route. The flights from Riga to London are also carried out by Airbaltic and Ryanair.
LATVIA 'S AIRBALTIC NOT TO INCREASE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS FROM RIGA TO LONDON THIS YEAR 
DUE TO LACK OF CAPACITY
In 2006, Airbaltic flew 1,425,276 passengers at a 37 percent boost from the previous year. Currently Airbaltic 
serves 33 direct routes from Riga and 12 direct routes from Vilnius, as well as flights between Kaliningrad and 
Copenhagen. Airbaltic, established in 1995, belongs to the Latvian state (52.6 pct) and Scandinavia's SAS AB 
group (47.2 pct)

The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair might open a base in the Riga airport when the airline serves 2.5-3 million 
passengers on its Riga routes a year, the company's president Michael O'Leary told the press.
He said that Ryanair's plans on the base in Riga thus depend on the airport's development. The Ryanair president 
said that the Riga airport was the fastest growing airport in the region, but still it has to expand twice for Ryanair to 
build a base in Riga, and the state has to support development of the airport.
O'Leary said that Ryanair's investments in its base in Riga would be 300 million US dollars.
Even though Ryanair currently has 19 base airports in Europe, there is no base in the Baltic states or Poland. About 
15 other airports in the Central and Eastern Europe are competing for Ryanair's base, said O'Leary.
He also said that Ryanair's base would be a good advertisement for Latvia in the whole Europe. The base would 
have 200 staff members and the number of routes would be increased from seven to 30.
Latvian Transport Minister Ainars Slesers told the press that opening of Ryanair's base would be very important for 
the Riga airport.
The Latvian Transport Ministry reported that to develop the Riga international airport as the center of regional 
flights, 500-600 million lats (EUR 711-853 mln) should be invested in expanding the terminal and investing in 
construction of a new runway. Slesers also said that the airport should in the coming years be able to serve 15 
million passengers a year, increasing the number to 30 million a year.
RYANAIR 'S BASE TO BE OPENED IN RIGA WHEN AIRLINE SERVES 2.5-3 MLN PASSENGERS 
ANNUALLY
In 2006, Ryanair served 664,976 passengers on flights between Riga and other European cities, taking a 26.7 
percent market share at Riga airport in terms of passenger numbers, the figures of the Riga airport suggest.
The Irish no-frills carrier that launched operations in Latvia in October 2004 serves seven routes from Riga, 
including to the Swedish capital Stockholm, Great Britain' s cities London and Liverpool, Frankfurt in Germany, 
Tampere in Finland, as well as to the Irish capital Dublin and Glasgow in Scotland. From April 1, Ryanair planes will 
also start flying from Riga to Bremen in Germany.

The no-frills airline Ryanair could begin flights to Tallinn this fall, yet for this to happen the Estonian government 
must allow the state-owned airport company to significantly reduce airport fees, Postimees reported.
Lowering the fees for Ryanair only would be illegal, the daily said.
Minister of Economy and Communications Edgar Savisaar said on his weblog last week that Ryanair could begin 
flights to Tallinn already this fall.
The ministry's spokeswoman Anu Moistlik added that negotiations between the state and the airline were under 
way and that it was still open whether the flights would start in fall 2007 or in spring 2008.
Ryanair is known to negotiate fees not with individual airports but with the ministry responsible for airports in the 
respective country, the newspaper said.
Rein Loik, the manager of Tallinn Airport, said an agreement with the government was necessary to be able to 
lower the airport fees. While the Irish airline would not accept the current fees, the airport cannot make an exception 
to Ryanair alone.
"The ministry has expressed it clearly that according to their view turning in a profit should not be the primary goal 
for the airport as an infrastructure company," Loik said. He added that Ryanair's starting flights to Tallinn would 
interest the airport very much as it would help to significantly boost the number of passengers.
Ryanair flies to all the other Baltic states as well as to Finland and Sweden, Estonia being the only exception in the 
region.
ESTONIA EXPECTED TO MOVE TO GET RYANAIR FLY TO TALLINN FROM AUTUMN
When Ryanair started flights to Latvia a few years ago it pledged to bring more than 500,000 new air passengers to 
that country. That figure has been surpassed by now, the paper said.

Lithuania's Kaunas Airport, from which Ireland's budget airline Ryanair operates flights to a number of European 
destinations, said passenger numbers trebled last year compared with 2005 to reach 250,000.
The airport said in a statement that its share of the domestic passenger market had surged from 2.5 percent to 13.8 
percent over the past two years, making it the second largest airport in Lithuania in terms of passenger numbers.
Kaunas Airport handled almost 5,000 flights last year. Ryanair, which began services to and out of Kaunas in 
September 2005, plans to carry its 1,000th flight from the airport in February.
Kaunas Airport also said that it achieved a 60 percent growth in cargo traffic in 2006 to over 6,600 tons and retained 
its number-one position among the country's airports.
According to preliminary data, Kaunas Airport posted a net profit of around 200,000 litas (EUR 58,000) on revenue 
of some 5 million litas last year.
The airport plans to extend its passenger terminal by some 3,000 square meters by next October in order to comply 
with the Schengen requirements. Investment in the project may reach around 10 million litas.

A Boeing 737-800 owned by the Irish budget airline Ryanair could not take off from Vilnius International Airport for 
several hours on Wednesday because its pilots were unable to pay for fuel.
The jet was supplied with fuel only after Ryanair had sent by fax a payment guarantee letter.
The Boeing 737-800 arrived in Vilnius before noon on Wednesday after thick fog had prevented it from landing in 
Kaunas, from which Ryanair operates its flights.
Some 180 passengers, transported to Vilnius from Kaunas, had to wait for several hours for their flight to London.
"It was only after Vilnius Airport's administration had made a call to Ireland to inform them about the problems that 
we received a proper letter, written on the company's letterhead, guaranteeing that they would pay for the fuel," 
Vilnius Airport spokesman Arunas Marcinkevicius said.
The pilots did not have special cards that are normally used to pay for fuel, while the initial letter faxed by Ryanair 
did not have the required signatures and stamps.
The Irish airline began services to and out of Lithuania in September last year. It now offers flights from Kaunas to 
Stockholm, Dublin, London, Liverpool and Frankfurt.

With the international airports of Vilnius and Kaunas, the largest in Lithuania, still shrouded in fog, the Palanga 
airport in Western Lithuania has been working at full capacity for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.
The airport is completely filled up with planes that have been forced to land there owing to poor weather conditions.
"The work is truly intensive. We have been working without breaks for the second consecutive day," Leonas 
Kvietkauskas, the Palanga airport director, told BNS.
In his words, two Ryanair planes, two Latvia's Airbaltic planes and two planes of Lithuania's flagship carrier flyLAL-
Lithuanian Airlines were currently based at the airport.
"Perhaps we could accept two morke planes, however, there is no space for more," Kvietkauskas noted.
The airports of Vilnius and Kaunas have confirmed that the conditions remained tough, mostly due to thick fog.
"The weather conditions have not improved, we still have no chances to work in a usual regime," said Arunas 
Marcinkevicius, the Vilnius Airport spokesman.
Kestutis Cucenas, Kaunas Airport CEO, confirmed that there were no signs of fog dissipating.
"It has been some time since we last had such thick fog during the whole days. Passengers are the ones to suffer 
the most," he told BNS.
Thick fog has been shrouding the two major airports since weekend.

The decision announced by British Airways (BA) to stop serving its route between Riga and London in spring will 
not decrease the number of tourists from London, but will leave an impact on the quality of flights, said tourism 
industry experts. Latvia's largest travel agency Latvia Tours board chairwoman Gundega Zeltina told BNS that "of 
course it is a pity that British Airways did not manage to hold the competition and will not fly from Riga to London". 
In her words, it will not decrease the number of travelers. "Customers will have cheaper flight tickets, but they will 
also miss quality service," said Zeltina. 
Latvia's Hotel and Restaurant Association president Janis Jenzis told BNS that British Airways decided to leave the 
Riga airport because of Ryanair. "Of course, we will possibly lose customers who are loyal to British Airways, but it 
is hard to forecast any figures," he said, adding that British Airways mainly carried rich tourists. British Airways 
announced that the company will stop serving its route between Riga and London as of March 25, 2007. The British 
carrier's representative in the Baltics Tom Anderson said that the airline is forced to stop flying to the Latvian 
capital, as the route has proved to be unprofitable. British Airways in ten months this year carried 67,700 
passengers, which is 3.2 percent of the total number of passengers served in the Riga airport. British Airways has 
served flights between London and Riga since 1997. London is the most popular destination among passengers of 
the Riga airport. As many as 278,050 people flew between Riga and London in January-October this year, 
accounting for 14.2 percent of all passengers served at Riga airport over the period. Flights between London and 
Riga are offered also by Latvian national carrier Airbaltic and Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. Riga newsroom, +371

Norwegian investors plan to spend 400 million euros on construction of a business park in the territory of the Riga 
airport, said Petter Lundeby, board member of EBO International, subsidiary of project developer company EBO 
Invest. He said that the multi-functional business park project by EBO International has been chosen as the best 
one in an open competition for rent of the Riga airport territory. Under the project, three hotels, an exhibition center, 
conference rooms, offices and a car park will cover 21 hectares of land. 
During the first stage of the project, two four-star hotels and one economy class hotel with 750 rooms will be built in 
three years. The most modern north European exhibition center will be able to host international fairs, exhibitions, 
sports and music events with an audience of 10,000 people. "Our aim is to create a fully integrated multi-functional 
business park, which will promote uninterrupted dynamic development of the Riga airport, " said Lundeby, adding 
that Riga airport is seen as a significant north European transport and business center. Hotel operator Radisson 
SAS and airline Ryanair have already shown interest in the planned business park, said Lundeby. Airport's 
spokeswoman Ginta Bormane told BNS earlier that Latvijas Pasts postal company's sorting center and cargo 
processing centers have already been built and projects of SAS Pilot Academy, Preses Nams publishing house 
production plant and logistics center are underway in the territory of the airport. According to the Latvian Business 
Register, real estate company EBO International was founded in March this year and its registered capital is 2,000 
lats (EUR 2,846), and its sole owner is Norway's company EBO Invest. Riga airport is fully owned by the Latvian 
state and it plans to serve 2.5 million passengers this year. (EUR 1 = LVL 0.7028) Riga newsroom, +371 708 8606,

business at the airport of Kaunas, the second largest Lithuania's city, in September 2005.

The arrival of two foreign budget airlines helped Kaunas Airport to move into profit this year after years of loss-
making operations.
The Lithuanian Transport Ministry has reported that all of the country's three international airports, in Vilnius, 
Kaunas and Palanga, ended the first half of this year in the black. Their profit figures have not been published, 
however.
Ireland's Ryanair and Hungary's low-fare carrier Wizzair currently operate out of Kaunas Airport.
Vilnius Airport, the largest in Lithuania, remained the busiest airport in terms of passengers, while Kaunas Airport 
ranked first in terms of cargo traffic
Vilniaus Airport posted a pretax profit of 23.52 million litas (EUR 6.82 mln) for the full year 2005, while Palanga 
Airport ended the year with a profit of 310,000 litas. Kaunas Airport reported losses of around 700,000 litas.

Representatives from the low-fares airline Ryanair and Estonia's Economy and Communications Minister Edgar 
Savisaar who met on Wednesday said that realistically Ryanair could start flights to and from Tallinn in fall 2007.
Both sides stated strong interest in launching air traffic and decided to continue negotiations so that Ryanair could 
fly to Estonia profitably in the future, spokespeople for the Ministry of Economy and Communications said.
Bernhard Berger, director in charge of new routes at Ryanair, said Estonia was currently the only Baltic state that 
Ryanair was not flying to.
The sides said it would be attractive if Ryanair could offer flights at 50 percent the fares of other companies, the 
ministry said.
The parties pledged to "intensify" their negotiations and bring in Tallinn Airport along with representatives from 
Estonian travel companies.
The press has earlier mentioned that Ryanair is hoping for the ministry's assistance to achieve suitable conditions 
for flying to Tallinn.
The signing of an agreement is complicated by the circumstance that Ryanair wants a contract fixing the number of 
passengers and what the company brings with the new route, as well as airport fees, which should be considerably 
lowered to suit Ryanair.
In the opinion of Tallinn Airport, however, the discounts would boil down to discrimination against other carriers, 
mainly Estonian Air.
Tallinn Airport is owned by the state. The minister of economy and communications constitutes the general meeting 
of shareholders of Tallinn Airport.

UK carrier British Airways, which re-established service to Lithuania after a few years' break in 2005, has decided to 
terminate flights on the route London-Vilnius in fall.
"The decision to terminate flights on the route London-Vilnius was particularly hard to take. However, this route is 
not profitable enough, and we have decided to turn down this service at the end of October," said Rasa Barisiene, 
British Airways sales and marketing manager.
The UK company wills stop any flights to Vilnius on Oct. 29.
British Airways first opened the route London-Vilnius back in 1998, to terminate it in 2000 and re-establish in late 
March 2005.
Late in March 2006, the company operated daily service on its London-Vilnius route.
Currently flights from Vilnius to London are being offered by Lietuvos Avialinijos (Lithuanian Airlines), British 
Airways and Latvia's Airbaltic. Irish no-frill carrier Ryanair offers a route to London from Kaunas.

Officials of the Estonian Economic Affairs and Communications Ministry Tuesday met with representatives of the 
low-cost airline Ryanair in Irland and agreed on a next meeting in Tallinn, in which the minister, Edgar Savisaar, is 
also going to take part.
A spokesman for the ministry said the meeting in Dublin was the opening of a probably long dialogue between the 
Estonian ministry and the carrier.
The parties presented their positions at the meeting and agreed on the next meeting in Tallinn, which is going to be 
attended by the minister.
"Both the sides are interested in a positive solution. We want that them to start flying, otherwise there wouldn't have 
been any reason to meet," said Tonis Lepp, deputy head of the ministry's aviation and maritime department.
The press has earlier mentioned that Ryanair is hoping for the ministry's assistance to achieve suitable conditions 
for flying to Tallinn. Estonia is currently the only European Union member country with no Ryanair destination.
The signing of an agreement is complicated by the circumstance that Ryanair wants a contract fixing the number of 
passengers and what the company brings with the new route, as well as airport taxes, which should be 
considerably lowered to suit Ryanair's taste.
In the opinion of the Tallinn Airport, however, the discounts would boil down to discrimination against other carriers,

Oleg Harlamov, adviser to the Estonian Ministry for Economic Affairs, and Tonis Lepp, deputy head of the ministry's 
maritime and aviation department, will Tuesday in Dublin meet with representatives of the no-frill airline Ryanair.
A representative of the ministry told BNS that Tuesday's meeting would not decide anything, rather it is to sound out 
each other.
The press has earlier mentioned that Ryanair is hoping the ministry can help them to get the conditions suitable for 
them to start flying to Tallinn. At the moment, Estonia is the only member country of the European Union where the 
Irish low-cost airline has no destinations.
Signing of a contract is made complicated by the fact that Ryanair wants a so-to-say bulk contract, where the 
number of passengers is fixed, and what the company brings with the new route, as well as airport taxes, which 
Ryanair finds should be considerably lower.
According to Eesti Paevaleht Ryanair wants discounts, lowering of the passenger fee figuratively saying to one unit, 
if they meet their promise and bring half a million passengers to Tallinn. At the same time other carriers pay several 
times more.
In the opinion of the Tallinn Airport the discounts would be mean discrimination against other airlines, mainly 
Estonian Air.

The University of Latvia this year has received applications from 7,001 future students, down a little from 7,072 
applications last year, said the university. The university on Wednesday evening stopped accepting applications 
from potential students for the academic year 2006/07. Entrance exams in specialties where centralized high school 
examination results alone are not sufficient for enrolment will begin on Thursday. Just like in previous years, the 
largest number of applications (2,594) was submitted for studies in the Faculty of Social Sciences. The 
communication science remains the most popular of study programs with 1,369 applications. The competition is 
very high as there are 123 potential students per one slot of state-paid studies. Potential students, who have failed 
to win state-paid studies, would be able to study at the university for a tuition fee. Riga newsroom, +371 708 8611,

- LATVIA TO OFFER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO FAMILY DOCTORS OPENING PRACTICES IN PROVINCES
The Latvian Health Ministry will grant 15,000 lats (EUR 21,300) in start-up costs to each of the family doctors, who 
would agree to take up medical practice in one of the 10 locations in provinces which have remained without a 
general practitioner for several years. Speaking on the public Latvian Radio, Health Minister Gundars Berzins said 
that there were locations that had not had a local general practitioner for as many as seven years while doctors 
were even queuing up for certain medical practices in Riga. The minister said that Latvia would face a shortage of 
family doctors in future as most of the current practitioners were close to the retirement age. "It is a huge problem," 
he said. Speaking about shortage of medical nurses in Latvia, Berzins said he would not permit import of nurses 
from Belarus or other countries. The minister said that sufficient number of medical nurses is trained in Latvia but 
only every fourth of medical nurse school graduates went to work at hospitals. He said it was due to "the new and 
aggressive" demand for nurses and nurse assistants in foreign countries, for example, Finland. Nevertheless, the 
minister would not paint the future all black. "I can say with full responsibility that ministers in neighboring countries 
shed a sad tear or two upon learning how much funds the government has earmarked for us during the next cycle," 
said Berzins, speaking about health care allocations from the EU structural funds during the planning period of 
2007-13. He said that 247 million lats have been earmarked for medicine in the next period and funds have been 
granted for medicine also within financing allocated to other ministries such as the Education and Science Ministry, 
the E-affairs Ministry, the Transport Ministry. The health minister said that health care should remain priority on the 
government agenda. "As public welfare improves, the role of health care only grows stronger, not weakens," said 
Berzins. Riga newsroom, +371 708 8611, zinas@bns.lv
- OVER 50 RESIDENTS OF LATVIA CAUGHT UP IN WAR ZONE IN LEBANON (updates, adds comments by 
foreign minister)
A total of 54 residents of Latvia have been reported to be caught up in the war zone in Lebanon, the press service 
of the Latvian Foreign Ministry said. Of those, 13 people have turned to the ministry for help. A resident of Latvia 
together with his Lebanese father are said to have left Lebanon Monday on board a French ship and arrived in 
Cyprus, where they received assistance from the Latvian honorary consul. The consul will help them to get to 
Latvia, as soon as the Lebanese gets his passport. They might arrive in Latvia by Czech Airlines already on 
Wednesday. Another resident of Latvia has left Lebanon by bus traveling through Syria and is expected to arrive in 
Riga on Thursday. France has offered other Latvians who have sought assistance to leave Lebanon by a ship 
scheduled to leave for Cyprus next week. The Norwegian embassy in Lebanon has offered a Latvian to leave for 
Damascus in Syria by a bus escorted by a convoy, but the offer has not been accepted so far. Nine other residents 
of Latvia will possibly want to return to Latvia, while 15 others have said they do not want to leave Lebanon. 
Another three residents of Latvia have left Lebanon with assistance from Russia. The Latvian Foreign Ministry still 
is uncertain about the situation of several poeple, who cannot be reached over the phone or might have already left 
Lebanon. Latvian Foreign Minister Artis Pabriks told BNS that the Latvian goverenment could decide on aid to

Lebanon this week. "Most probably, we will have to revise the national reserves as the funds in the state budget are

caught in the military conflict in Lebanon. Israel's armed forces launched military attacks on Lebanon last week after 
Lebanon's radical Islamist group Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers. The conflict has claimed the lives of more 
than 250 people since last Wednesday. Riga newsroom, +371 708 8611, zinas@bns.lv

Europe's leading no-frills airline Ryanair has turned to the Estonian Ministry of Economy and Communications 
suggesting a three-way agreement on flights to Tallinn, the Eesti Paevaleht daily reports.
The three parties to the agreement would be the ministry, the Tallinn airport and Ryanair. The airline is counting on 
the ministry's help to achieve suitable terms for flying to Tallinn. Estonia is at present the only member state of the 
European Union where Ryanair does not fly.
Concluding such an agreement is complicated by Ryanair offering a "volume agreement" fixing the number of 
passengers to be flown in by the airline and significantly lower airport dues, the paper says.
According to the source of Eesti Paevaleht, Ryanair is demanding favored terms if it keeps its promise and brings 
half a million passengers to Tallinn. Other airlines meanwhile pay several times bigger dues.
The Tallinn airport finds such terms would be discriminatory to other carriers, in particular Estonian Air.
The airport has concluded no passenger volume-based contracts so far but links all agreements to the cost of 
flights regardless of their number, while Ryanair has based all its agreements in the rest of Europe on the 
passenger volume.
According to Eesti Paevaleht, representatives of the ministry and Ryanair will meet at the end of this month to 
discuss possible cooperation.
Ryanair is keen to start flying to Tallinn and so is the airport. Whether the plan materializes depends on three-way 
compromises, the daily says.

Hungary's no frill carrier Wizz Air aims to pull out from Kaunas Airport from September owing to low demand in its 
flights from and to the airport, which the carrier entered in December 2005.
Wizz Air had sent a letter notifying that the carrier would stop any flight from the airport from Sept. 8, Kestutis 
Cucenas, Kaunas Airport CEO, told the public television. However, the airport management was holding talks with 
the carrier as it sought to convince Wizz Air to continue business in Kaunas, he added.
The rise in the passenger flow on the new routes of Wizz Air was probably less significant than the company had 
expected, Cucenas said. However, the number of passengers on those routes increased, he pointed out.
Wizz Air abandoned its plans to offer flights from Kaunas to Malme in March.
Meanwhile, Ryanair, the Irish budget carrier, has well established itself at the airport, constantly expanding the 
geography of flights and offering new routes.
