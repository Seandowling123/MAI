Gatwick chief expects more carriers to go bust; Airlines

The chief executive of Gatwick, the UK's second-busiest airport, said he expected some airlines to fall into 
bankruptcy this winter after a number of failures.
"You will have a small number of airline failures," Stewart Wingate said, though he did not expect any big carriers to 
collapse.
Gatwick experienced a failure in 2017 when the UK's Monarch went into administration. Last week Cyprusbased 
carrier Cobalt Air failed.
Almost three-quarters of Gatwick's flights are provided by easyJet, British Airways and Norwegian. The rest are split 
between more than 50 carriers.
The Gatwick chief said Monarch's failure had not hurt Gatwick. "Our secondlargest carrier, BA ... bought the full 
portfolio of Monarch slots. We envisage they'll now start to use those slots for long-haul flying in the years ahead."
Industry reports suggested that BA paid £60m for the slots, not all of which it was able to use immediately.
Several other European airlines have failed in the past two years, including Air Berlin and Alitalia. Latvia's Primera 
Air, Small Planet in Germany and Belgium's VLM have collapsed in the past couple of months.
Other carriers have warned on profit. Last week the UK's Flybe said it would make a full-year pre-tax loss of about 
£22m, against market expectations of a £3.5m loss, which caused its shares to fall more than 40 per cent in a day.
Gatwick chief expects more carriers to go bust; Airlines
Earlier this month, Ryanair cut its full-year profit guidance from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-
(EURO)1.2bn and warned that the final figure might fall further still, blaming strikes, resulting compensation costs, 
and fuel prices. The cost of fuel had risen to $96 a barrel by mid-October, up 39 per cent on a year ago.
Bjoern Maul, a partner in consultancy Oliver Wyman's aviation practice, said the failure of these carriers tended to 
be the result of "overexpansion, being behind in restructuring ... [and] issues around changing market environments 
all of a sudden".
Gatwick has published proposals to bring its shorter standby runway into regular use and increase capacity from 
281,000 flights this year to up to 390,000 by 2033. Passenger numbers would increase to up to 70m.

 China cutting income taxes sparked a surge in Asia supporting a 60-point jump in the Nasdaq, and a 30-point jump 
in the S&P ahead of 160 S&P companies slated to report earnings, a multitude of FOMC speakers, and ECB, 
Canadian and Russian Central Bank decisions due this week, said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at Jones Trading.

points early. The FTSE added just over 50 points as Ryanair rallied on numbers, while Banks in London jumped 
1%.
Over in Asia, the Nikkei was up small, but Hang Seng jumped 2.3% and Shanghai ripped 4% higher, its biggest 
move in 2 years, on promises of tax cuts and further supportive moves from regulators.  The KOSPI added 25 
points, while the Aussie off 60 points as the banks slumped.
The US 10Y remained just under 3.2% as Bunds saw selling amid a rally in BTPs after Moody's kept them above 
junk status, pressing the spread to bunds just under 3%. The US dollar was stronger, with the euro retracing earlier 
gains trying to hold $1.15 support, while sterling was under pressure on Brexit headers.  The dollar-yen rallied 
above Y113, while commodity currencies were trending lower.
Iron Ore jumped 2% in Dalian, and copper surged 1.5% higher, carrying every metal into the green except gold.    
The energy complex was mixed, with Brent attempting to rise above $80 on Saudi angst and Iranian sanctions 
implementation concerns, while WTI was drifting ahead of Tuesday's expiry.

immediate threat of a downgrade to junk.
Traders are also looking ahead to Thursday's policy statement from the European Central Bank.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.----------COMPANIES----------Ryanair Holdings said profit 
fell in the first half of its current financial year due to the higher fuel costs and compensation of passengers affected 
by flight delays and cancellations. The Irish budget airline said pretax profit for the six months ended September 30 
declined 13% to EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.45 billion reported for the same period a year earlier, despite revenue 
improving by 8.1% to EUR4.79 billion from EUR4.43 billion. Ryanair said higher fuel, staff and compensation costs 
offset the strong revenue growth. In addition, average fares declined 3% to EUR46 due to excess capacity in 
Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated air traffic controllers' strikes. 
Meanwhile, traffic improved by 6% on year during the period to 76.6 million, while load factor remained flat at 96%.-
---------NMC Health lifted its annual guidance due to "positive developments" in the second half of 2018. The UAE-
based private healthcare company has raised its 2018 revenue growth expectations to 24% from 22%. Earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation guidance was lifted to USD480 million from USD465 million. In 
calendar 2017, the FTSE 100 listed company recorded revenue of USD1.60 billion and Ebitda of USD353.4 million. 
The revenue growth guidance suggests 2018 revenue of GBP1.98 billion. NMC Health also predicts continuation of 
strong organic growth in 2019 on the back of the ramp-up of key facilities, integration and expansion of acquired 
entities, and a strong operational performance. For 2019, revenue is forecast to increase by between 22% and 24% 
and Ebitda by 18% to 20%. ---------- BP said it has received UK regulatory approval to develop a new offshore oil 
and gas development near the Shetland Islands. The FTSE 100-listed oil major explained the UK Oil & Gas 
Authority had approved its request to develop the 20 million barrels of oil equivalent Alligin project in the North Sea. 
Alligin - operated by BP, which owns half of the project with peer Royal Dutch Shell holding the remainder - is 140 
kilometres off the coast of the Shetland Islands and its expected to produce 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day 
at its peak. It is expected to come on-stream in 2020 after an expected GBP230 million in investment spend.---------- 
GlaxoSmithKline said a phase two study of its rheumatoid arthritis drug showed promising results. The drug, 
GSK3196165, is also known as GSK165 and was studied in a randomised controlled trial of 222 patients with 
moderate to severe forms of arthritis. Results showed that the drug was effective as early as week 1 for all doses 
above 22.5 milligrams, continuing throughout the weekly dosing and statistically significant at week 12. Patients 
were given five weekly injections with the drug, followed injections every other week until week 50, with GSK165 
proving effective throughout the every other week phase, proving statistically significant at week 24. GSK said that 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Profit Slides On Strikes And Fuel Costs
the improvement in patient-based measures such as joint pain and swelling were "particularly marked".---------- 
AstraZeneca said its Lynparza drug substantially reduced the risk of disease progression or death in patients with 
ovarian cancer. The drug, Lynparza, inhibits a type of protein that helps repair damaged cells called PARP or poly-
ADP ribose polymerase. The goal of this type of inhibitor is to stop PARP from repairing cancer cells. Lynparza is 
the only PARP inhibitor to have improved progression-free survival as a maintenance treatment in advanced 
ovarian cancer. The results emerged from Astra's SOLO-1 phase three randomised placebo-controlled trial of 391 
advanced ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation, who were newly diagnosed and had already been given 
chemotherapy.----------Lloyds Banking Group is planning to buy back almost GBP2 billion in shares in 2019, the 
Financial Times reported. The FT reported the plans were at an "early stage" and would not be finalised until a 
board meeting in February. The plan would need to be approved by a regulator and could be derailed by a hard 
Brexit. Lloyds also could decide to keep the capital and use it for acquisitions, the newspaper noted. According to 
the FT, Lloyds hopes to be able to return about GBP4.5 billion in 2019 via a higher dividend and the share buyback. 
If it goes ahead as planned, the GBP2 billion buyback in 2019 will be double the GBP1 billion conducted in the 
current year.----------MARKETS----------London shares were higher amid strong gains in Asia with NMC Health the 
best blue chip performer, up 9.1%. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open with oilfield services firm Halliburton, 
personal care company Kimberly-Clark and toy maker Hasbro reporting earnings before the market open in New 
York. ----------FTSE 100: up 0.5% at 7,085.07FTSE 250: up 0.2% at 18,838.89AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.1% at

 Low cost airline Ryanair (RYA.L) posted a drop in its first half profit on Monday as staff shortages, air traffic control 
strikes and higher fuel costs offset an increase in the budget carrier's ancillary revenue.
The Irish air carrier generated profit of 1.20 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the six months ended September 30, 
down 7% compared to the corresponding half of the prior year.  Revenue was up by 8% to 4.79 billion euros over 
the same time frame. 
"As recently guided, [first half] average fares fell by 3%. While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, these 
were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs," Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said. "Our traffic, 
which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC[air traffic control] disruptions on record, grew 6% at an 
unchanged 96% load factor". 
During the period, Ryanair said that agreements were signed with Irish, UK, Italian and Portuguese pilots and with 
German cabin crew unions. It also increased its stake in airline Laudamotion to 75% and returned 540 million euros 
to shareholders via buybacks. 
For the full year, the company reiterated that it is guiding for profit in the range of 1.10 billion euros to 1.20 billion 
euros excluding Laudamotion. However it said that the guidance remained heavily dependent on air fares not 
declining further, the impact of significantly higher oil prices on its unhedged exposures and ATC and other strikes 
among other potential factors.
Ryanair said that Laudamotion will lose approx. 150 million euros in start-up first year exceptional costs. It said that 
it is working closely with the Laudamotion team. It said that it is assisting them to improve cost control, fuel hedging 
and fleet management as the airline moves towards break-even in its second year of operation.

traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC disruptions on record, grew 6% at an 
unchanged 96% load factor," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it now expects annual traffic growth of 6% to 138 million passengers - slightly down on 
previous guidance of 139 million - following a 1% reduction in winter capacity. The airline's fuel bill is expected to 
come in about EUR460 million higher year-on-year, while other costs will grew on passenger compensations.
It guided after tax profit for all of financial 2019 to the end of March to be between EUR1.10 billion and EUR1.20 
billion, excluding recent acquisition Laudamotion.
Ryanair said its annual guidance is "heavily dependent" on air fares not declining further, while Ryanair also

 European stocks advanced on Monday, with Italian markets leading the surge after Moody's Investors Service cut 
Italy's credit rank by one step to Baa3, but set the outlook for the assessment at "stable", removing the immediate 
threat of a downgrade to junk.
A big rally in Chinese markets for the second day running on hopes for more stimulus also bolstered investor 
sentiment.
China's Shanghai Composite index jumped 4.09% to 2,654.88, extending a 2.6% rebound on Friday, after 
President Xi Jinping vowed "unwavering" support for the country's private sector.
In an open letter published in state media, he said that Beijing would continue to value and protect the country's 
private business owners to ensure a "better tomorrow".
Closer home, the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.25% at 362.13 in late opening deals after

 Stocks in London are set to open higher on Monday, despite growing global political tensions.
In early company news, budget airline Ryanair saw interim profit fall as average fares slid due to "excess capacity" 
in Europe and strikes.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 6.9 points higher at 7,056.70 on Monday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed closed up 0.3%, or 22.81 points at 7,049.80 on Tuesday.
"Asian shares bounced higher on Monday, as Chinese stocks extended their rebound for a second straight session, 
pulling European futures higher in the process. Beijing's pledge of support for the economy is overshadowing 
geopolitical concerns over Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit," said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital 
Group.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is up 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is climbing a 
sharp 4.6%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 2.5%.
Lawler continued: "Saudi Arabia will remain in focus on Monday as relations with foreign governments continue to 
deteriorate. Riyadh's hands are looking increasingly dirty following the disappearance of journalist Jamal 
Kasshoggi. This has encouraged investors to price in a changing relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia."
Over the weekend, a ruling party spokesman said Turkey is committed to uncovering all details on dissident 
journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, hours after the Saudi leadership confirmed 
the death.
"Turkey will reveal whatever happened. No one should have a doubt about it," said Omer Celik, from President 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice & Development Party, according to state news agency Anadolu.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Higher Call; Ryanair Hit By Decline In Fares
Early Saturday, Riyadh claimed that Khashoggi died at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul following a "fist fight," 
according to the state-run news agency SPA.
In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May will insist the Brexit deal is 95% complete as she faces MPs after a 
weekend of vicious attacks from within her own ranks.
In a Commons statement after talks with EU leaders in Brussels, the prime minister will say the "shape of the deal 
across the vast majority" of the withdrawal agreement is now clear.
She will tell MPs that since last month's fractious summit in Salzburg, "important progress" has been made on 
issues like security, transport and services.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3% but the 
S&P 500 slightly lower and Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.5%.
In the economic calendar on Monday is Ireland wholesale price index at 1100 BST and the Chicago Fed National 
Activity index at 1330 BST.
In a thin corporate calendar scheduled for Monday, budget airline Ryanair reported a fall in first half profit as 
average fares slid due to "excess capacity" in Europe.
Total operating revenue - including Laudamotion - rose to EUR4.84 billion in the six months to September 30 from 
EUR4.43 billion a year ago. However, the airline's pretax profit slipped to EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.45 billion. 
Excluding Lauda - the former Air Berlin subsidiary in which Ryanair secured approval from the EU in July to 
increase its stake to 75% from 24.9% - revenue came in at EUR4.79 billion and profit at EUR1.32 billion.
While traffic grew 6% in the period to 76.6 million customers, average fares fell 3% to below EUR46.00.
"While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs. Our 
traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC disruptions on record, grew 6% at an 
unchanged 96% load factor," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
The company said its annual guidance is "heavily dependent" on air fares not declining further, while Ryanair also 
continues to monitor "significantly higher" oil prices on its unhedged exposures.

 Share prices in London are set to open in the green on Monday, despite rising global political tensions.
In early company news, budget airline Ryanair said interim profit fell as average fares slid due to "excess capacity" 
in Europe and strikes, while NMC Health upgraded its annual guidance and AstraZeneca reported positive results 
from a Lynparza trial.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 16.70 points higher at 7,066.50 on Monday. The

Over the weekend, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to provide a full account of the killing of 
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince reportedly called his family to offer their 
condolences.
King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and effective ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz 
telephoned the dissident's son, Salah Khashoggi, who "expressed his sincere thanks" to the royals, the Saudi Press 
Agency said.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: NMC Health Ups Guidance; Ryanair Profit Down
Many observers have expressed the belief that Khashoggi's killing, which was described for the first time as 
"murder" by a Saudi official on Sunday, could not have been carried out without the crown prince's approval.
The report of their phone call came shortly after Erdogan pledged that he would go into the case "in detail" during a 
speech before members of his Justice & Development Party planned for Tuesday. 
In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May will insist a Brexit deal is 95% complete as she faces MPs after a weekend

fractious summit in Salzburg, "important progress" has been made on issues such as security, transport and 
services.
In early company news on Monday, NMC Health ahead of its capital markets day revised its annual guidance 
higher following "positive developments" over its second half.
The United Arab Emirates-focused private hospital operator now sees revenue growing 24%, compared to the 22% 
growth seen previously, while increasing its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation guidance 
to USD480 million from USD465 million.
"2019 guidance will also point towards continuation of strong organic growth on the back of sustained ramp-up at 
key facilities, integration and expansion of acquired entities as well as strong operational performance," said NMC.
Revenue in 2019 is forecast to increase by 22% to 24%, and Ebita is to rise between 18% to 20%.
AstraZeneca and Merck & Co said the phase 3 Solo trial showed the "statistically-significant and clinically-
meaningful improvement" in progression-free survival for Lynparza compared to placebo.
At 41 months of follow-up, the median progression-free survival for patients treated with Lynparza was not reached, 
compared to 13.8 months for patients treated with placebo. Of those receiving Lynparza, 60% remained 
progression-free at 36 months compared to 27% of women in the placebo arm.
Sean Bohen, executive vice president, global medicines development and chief medical officer, said: "The 
remarkable results of the SOLO-1 trial, which showed that 60% of women with newly-diagnosed, advanced BRCA-
mutated ovarian cancer remained progression-free at three years, highlight the potential of Lynparza as a 
maintenance therapy in the 1st-line setting."
In other pharmaceutical news, GlaxoSmithKline said a phase two study of its rheumatoid arthritis drug showed 
promising results.
Results showed that the drug was effective as early as week 1 for all doses above 22.5 milligrams, continuing 
throughout the weekly dosing and statistically significant at week 12.
Patients were given five weekly injections with the drug, followed injections every other week until week 50, with 
GSK165 proving effective throughout the every-other-week phase, proving statistically significant at week 24. GSK 
said that the improvement in patient-based measures such as joint pain and swelling were "particularly marked".
QinetiQ said it has agreed to take a majority stake in a military operational training provider, with an option to 
acquire the remainder of the firm after two years, for GBP23.5 million.
QinetiQ will buy a 85% stake in Inzpire Group, which is expected to expand the FTSE 250-listed defence firm's 
operational training offering and should create a "leading position" in mission data and advice for the F35 and 
Typhoon aircraft.

Elsewhere on the London Main Market, Lonmin said platinum sales for its recently-ended financial year exceeded 
guidance despite "tough market conditions".
The miner sold 681,580 ounces of platinum during the year to September 30, ahead of guidance of 650,000 to 
680,000. The average rand full basket price for the fourth quarter was up 26% on a year ago.
Tonnes mined by its Generation 2 shafts for the year increased 1.6% to 7.6 million tonnes, reflecting a "consistent 
performance" at core shafts.
"Despite tough market conditions, except the favourable rand, we have delivered more than we promised in all 
areas of our business. These pleasing results demonstrate once again that despite these uncertain times, we can 
dig deep and use all levers within our control to maintain our net cash position," said Chief Executive Ben Magara.
Budget airline Ryanair reported a fall in first half profit as average fares slid due to "excess capacity" in Europe.
Total operating revenue - including Laudamotion - rose to EUR4.84 billion in the six months to September 30 from

Ryanair forecasts end to union troubles by Christmas
Ryanair forecasts end to union troubles by Christmas

Ryanair said on Monday it hopes to conclude its remaining labor issues by Christmas, signaling a possible end to 
damaging flight disruptions which have dragged on its shares.
The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, also said it may have to cut its capacity further this winter due to high oil 
costs and intense competition, although these factors were helping it to resolve its difficult industrial relations.
"Given the adverse environment that's out there for airlines and the number of job losses being reported in recent 
weeks both by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common sense approach being taken by the 
unions," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation.
Ryanair shares rose by 3.7 percent at 0755 GMT, despite it reporting a 7 percent fall in profit during its key April-
September season due to high fuel costs, excess capacity and damage to bookings caused by a wave of strikes.
That was better than the 9 percent fall forecast by a poll of analysts in the wake of an Oct. 1 profit warning.
Over-capacity is likely to continue to weigh on average fares in the winter unless there is a major failure of a rival, 
but the failure of several small airlines in recent weeks is concentrating the minds of staff, O'Leary said.
Ryanair only needs to secure agreement with two major unions, in Belgium and Germany and is "hopeful of 
concluding agreements with them this side of Christmas," he added.
The airline, which has in the past threatened cuts to growth during negotiations with unions, has struggled with 
labor relations since it bowed to pressure to recognize trade unions for the first time last December.
Ryanair forecasts end to union troubles by Christmas
Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent three weeks ago and warned that worse may follow if a 
recent wave of pilot and cabin crew strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.
Increases in the oil price or further falls in fares could force Ryanair to add to the 1 percent cut in capacity 
announced alongside a profit warning on Oct. 1.
"If oil remains at or above $85 a barrel and fares are under pressure then it would probably be the sensible thing to 
do to take a look at capacity," Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan said.
Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer, reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros in the six months to 
Sept. 30. It reiterated its full-year profit forecast of between 1.1 billion euros and 1.2 billion euros.
That would be a 17-24 percent fall from the record 1.45 billion euro post-tax profit in its most recent financial year.
A poll of more than 10 analysts by Ryanair before the results found an average forecast of 1.127 billion euros for 
the full year and 1.175 billion for the six months to Sept. 30. (Reuters)

 Following a bumper session for equities in China on Monday, stock prices in London started the week in the green, 
with NMC Health and miners among the risers.
The FTSE 100 was up 0.3%, or 22.21 points, at 7,072.01. The FTSE 250 was up 0.4%, or 70.00 points, at 
18,865.75 and the AIM All-Share 0.1% higher at 1,000.66.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.2% at 11,993.90, while the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.4% at 17,095.67 and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies was flat at 11,683.64.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were up 0.8% and up 0.9% respectively.
The positive open comes after strong trading in Asia overnight, said Michael van Dulken, head of research at 
Accendo Markets.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.4%. In China, the Shanghai Composite finished a 
substantial 4.1% higher, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 2.1% in late trade.
"China [had] its best day in two and a half years, continuing Friday's recovery rally...Australia more downbeat amid 
political uncertainty, but dual-listed miners marginally higher on the back of the China rally," he said.
Miners in London were higher in in early trade, with Glencore up 2.6%, Antofagasta up 2.2%, and Anglo American 
1.7% higher.
Also in the green among FTSE 100 stocks, NMC Health gained 2.9% after the private hospital operator ahead of its 
capital markets day upgraded its annual guidance following "positive developments" during its second half.
The United Arab Emirates-focused firm now sees revenue growing 24%, compared to the 22% growth seen 
previously, while increasing its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation guidance to USD480 
million from USD465 million.

"2019 guidance will also point towards continuation of strong organic growth on the back of sustained ramp-up at 
key facilities, integration and expansion of acquired entities as well as strong operational performance," said NMC.
Revenue in 2019 is forecast to increase by 22% to 24%, and Ebita is to rise by between 18% and 20%.
Towards the bottom of the index were gaming firms, with GVC Holdings down 1.9% and Paddy Power Betfair down 
1.0%.
Accendo's van Dulken said: "Gambling companies will be sensitive to the UK chancellor's plans to increase remote 
gaming duty from 15% to 25% in next Tuesday&rsquo;s budget, to offset lost tax from recent stake limit changes on 
Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, a double-whammy for operators."
Elsewhere on the Main Market, Ryanair shares were up 3.8% despite the airline reporting a fall in interim profit.
The Irish budget airline said pretax profit for the six months ended September 30 declined 13% to EUR1.26 billion 
from EUR1.45 billion reported for the same period a year earlier, despite revenue improving by 8.1% to EUR4.79 
billion from EUR4.43 billion.
Ryanair said higher fuel, staff and compensation costs offset the strong revenue growth. In addition, average fares 
declined 3% to EUR46 due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated air 
traffic controllers' strikes. 
Second quarter profit of EUR877.1 million was "modestly ahead" of consensus, which had laid at EUR856.5 million, 
commented Irish broker Davy.
easyJet was up 3.0% after Ryanair's results, with British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines up 
1.7%.
In the economic calendar on Monday is Ireland's wholesale price index at 1100 BST and the Chicago Fed National 
Activity index at 1330 BST.
In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May will insist the Brexit deal is 95% complete as she faces MPs after a 
weekend of vicious attacks from within her own ranks.
In a Commons statement after talks with EU leaders in Brussels, the prime minister will say the "shape of the deal 
across the vast majority" of the withdrawal agreement is now clear.
She will tell MPs that since last month's fractious summit in Salzburg, "important progress" has been made on 
issues like security, transport and services.
"A Brexit deal appears closer but whether she can sell the deal to her party is a completely different question. 
Interestingly though, the last two weeks have seen some GBP shorts taken off, and IF the PM can avoid a 
leadership challenge in the coming days, GBP/USD will probably rally," said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe 
Generale.
In another source of tension in Europe, Italy is due to reply to a letter from the European Commission, after being 
against an "unprecedented" deviation from eurozone budget rules.
Rome's ruling populist parties are planning to raise next year's deficit to 2.4% of gross domestic product, from the 
0.8% set by a previous government.
The European Commission sent a first warning letter to Italy last week, and could decide to formally reject Italy's 
draft budget when it meets in Strasbourg on Tuesday.
On Sunday, Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio, leader of the ruling Five Star Movement, said Italy would respond to 
Brussels by standing up for its decisions.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - The European markets traded in the green for the bulk of 
Monday's session, but turned lower in the afternoon following the early reversal on Wall Street.  Early gains were 
fueled by the rally in the Chinese stock market and easing concerns over Italy. Moody's Investors Service cut Italy's 
credit rank by one step to Baa3, but set the outlook for the assessment at 'stable', removing the immediate threat of 
a downgrade to junk. 
 Traders are also looking ahead to Thursday's policy statement from the European Central Bank.  The pan-
European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.41 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 0.64 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 
0.35 percent.  The DAX of Germany dropped 0.26 percent and the CAC of France fell 0.62 percent. The FTSE 100 
of the U.K. declined 0.10 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.07 percent.  In Frankfurt, 
chemicals giant BASF slid 0.10 percent. The company has selected Harjavalta, Finland, as the first location for 
battery materials production serving the European automotive market.  Leoni tumbled 2.34 percent after the 
provider of energy and data management solutions in the automotive market reported weak third-quarter results. 
The company also announced a downward revision in its outlook for fiscal 2018.   In London, low-cost airline 
Ryanair jumped 4.19 percent despite reporting lower-than-expected profits for the second quarter of its fiscal year.  
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. leaped 3.09 percent in Milan after the automaker announced that it has entered into 
a definitive agreement to sell its automotive components business Magneti Marelli S.p.A for 6.2 billion euros.  
Consumer electronics giant Philips sank 8.69 percent in Amsterdam after its third-quarter net income plunged to

damage" from strikes and disruptions to air-traffic control across Europe, as well as lower fares and higher fuel and 
pilot costs.
The carrier said its net profit dropped to 1.2 billion euros (1.4 billion dollars) in the six months ended September 30, 
as average fares fell 3 per cent amid excess capacity in Europe and many air-traffic control (ATC) problems, "which 
caused a spike in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights."
Ryanair was also hit by strikes by its own pilots and cabin crew but said these caused minor financial impact.
"Repeated ATC strikes and staff shortages mean that 2018 will be the worst year on record for European ATC 
disruptions," Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
"These have caused widespread damage to airline punctuality and schedules," O'Leary said.
He said Ryanair had "made good progress" in negotiations with trade unions since it agreed to recognize them in 
December, citing agreements with pilots or cabin crew in Ireland, Italy, Britain, Germany and Portugal.
"We continue to engage with unions in our other major markets," O'Leary said, claiming "competitor employees 
have interfered to delay agreements" in some countries.
Ryanair staff staged eight days of strikes this summer, but the airline "worked well to minimize disruptions," he said.
The Dublin-based airline is contingency planning for the "rising" risk of Britain leaving the European Union in March 
with no withdrawal deal in place, O'Leary said.

       PARIS (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its profit attributable to equity holders 
of parent for the Half-Year ended September 30, 2018 decreased to 1.15 billion euros or 0.9892 euros per share 
from 1.29 billion euros or 1.0626 euros per share in the same period last year.  Ryanair reported a 7% fall in the 
first-half profits to 1.20 billion euros excluding Laudamotion losses. Average fares declined 3% due to excess 
capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first-quarter, repeated ATC strikes/staff shortages which caused a spike 
in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights. 
Higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs have offset strong ancillary revenue growth.  Profit before tax for the period 
declined to 1.26 billion euros from 1.45 billion euros in the prior year.  Total operating revenues from continuing 
operations grew to 4.84 billion euros from last year's 4.43 billion euros.  As updated on 1 October, fiscal year 2019 
profit is guided in a range of 1.10 billion euros to 1.20 billion euros, excluding Laudamotion. Following a 3% 
reduction in the first-half fares, it expects fares to fall by about 2% in the second-half  due to weaker than expected 
forward fares in the third-quarter (particularly the October school mid-term and Christmas) and the absence of 
Easter in the fourth-quarter. A 1% reduction in winter capacity means that fiscal year 2019 traffic will grow by 6% to 
138 million.  Ryanair noted that the full year guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further, 
the impact of significantly higher oil prices on unhedged exposures, the absence of unforeseen security events, 
ATC and other strikes and the impact of negative Brexit developments.   Ryanair said it cannot rule out further base 
closures or capacity cuts this winter if oil prices rise or air fares fall further. Winter trading may be positively 
impacted by the rate and timing of other airline failures which is already creating a ready supply of well trained pilots 
and cabin crew for S.19 growth.

BRITAIN'S top share index closed higher on Friday as a stronger US dollar boosted multinational stocks, higher oil 
prices lifted energy majors and investors sought safety in utilities and companies deemed less risky amid economic 
uncertainty.
The FTSE 100 clawed back earlier losses to close up 0.5 per cent The index rose 0.8 per cent on the week Today, 
embattled budget airline Ryanair will report its first-half earnings, with investors wary of how ongoing cancellations 
and industrial relations breakdowns are affecting forward bookings and the bottom line. On Friday the airline 
announced some agreements had been made with certain pilot and crew unions across Europe. On Tuesday, 
Premier Inn owner Whitbread will announce its interim results, with Allison Brittain's FTSE giant keen to show it can 
power on after it sells off its Costa coffee chain to Coca-Cola. Interim results will also be announced by Southend 
airport owner Stobart Group on Wednesday, with the company eager to put recent boardroom dramas behind it and 
focus again on the num-bers. Also reporting financial data on Wednesday are Barclays, with its third-quarter results 
and challenger Metro Bank with its third-quarter results as well.
Thursday sees full-year earnings from department store chain Debenhams, which will show if its plans to 
reinvigorate the UK high street have paid off. A third-quarter management statement is also due from Lloyds 
Banking Group, while advertising giant WPP will give a trading update.
RBS will report its third-quarter results on Friday. Minerals company Glencore will update investors on its third-
quarter production numbers.
International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia, will bookend the week with some more 
financial results from the aviation world. IAG's numbers will cover the busy summer period, but one in which an 
increasing number of Brits opted for a so-called staycation at home to enjoy the balmy temperatures of the June-
July heatwave.

Ryanair has come under fire for failing to remove a passenger who racially abused an elderly woman on board a 
flight on Friday afternoon.
The Irish carrier was criticised by passengers for its handling of the situation on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to 
Stansted for not removing the man from the aircraft.
A crew member did attempt to intervene in the dispute but did not resolve the situation.
The incident, which came ahead of the budget airline's half-year results today, will be a blow to efforts to improve its 
reputation through its "Always Getting Better" campaign.
"The cabin crew were young. The man just overpowered them," David Lawrence, who recorded part of the incident 
on video, told the Financial Times. "I'm sure there was some sort of training in place by Ryanair. I was expecting 
them to put that into place and follow proper procedures - ie: call the police. But they didn't."
The incident happened as passengers boarded the flight. The man attempted to pass the woman, who was seated 
in an aisle seat. An argument began between the man and the woman and her daughter when the woman 
supposedly took too long to move.
Ryanair under fire over abusive passenger; Carrier failed to remove man who hurled racist insults at elderly 
woman
"He was speaking about her race, saying ... all these derogatory things. I couldn't believe it," Mr Lawrence said.
Karl Turner, the shadow transport minister, said he would write to Ryanair and Liz Sugg, the aviation minister, "to 
ask what they've done about this". He said on Twitter that there were "clearly committed criminal offences".
The male passenger has not been identified and has not responded to the incident.
Ryanair said it had reported the incident to Essex police, adding: "As this is now a police matter, we cannot 
comment further."
It had previously stated that it would not tolerate "unruly behaviour" on its aircraft.
The carrier's low-cost strategy has previously led it to put low prices ahead of customer service - "we're low cost, 
mean bastards" its chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said this year.
But it has tried to move away from this uncaring image in recent years. It launched the "Always Getting Better" 
initiative in 2014 following two profit warnings in 2013. It hoped that the shift would improve its brand image, 
presenting a friendlier face and being "nicer" to customers.
The airline has suffered a series of PR problems over the past year. A mix-up in its pilot rostering last year led to 
more than 20,000 flights being cancelled. The airline was then pressed into recognising trade unions, despite 
previous assertions by Michael O'Leary, chief executive, that hell would "freeze over" before this happened.
But the airline has struggled to reach agreements with most unions and has been hit by a series of strikes.
Earlier this month, it issued another profit warning following weakened "customer confidence" which it said had 
been "affected by fear of further strikes".
Ryanair ranked 64th in the Skytrax 2018 World Airline Awards and 67th in the AirHelp Worldwide 2018 rankings.
It was bottom of Which's latest customer satisfaction survey in December last year.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares rose on Monday as the pound held weak amid 
ongoing political uncertainty surrounding Brexit and hopes for more stimulus in China helped lift mining stocks.   
The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 33 points or 0.46 percent at 7,082 in late opening deals after rising 0.3 percent 
on Friday.   GlaxoSmithKline was marginally higher after announcing encouraging results from a phase II dose-
ranging study of GSK165.  Low-cost airline Ryanair jumped 4.5 percent despite reporting lower-than-expected 
profits for the second quarter of its fiscal year.  Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore rose about 2 
percent each.   In economic news, a majority of British firms said Brexit had a negative effect on investment 
decision, according to a new research on business preparations by the Confederation of British Industry.  Eight out 
of ten firms said Brexit hit investment as speed of talks outpaced by reality firms face on ground. The majority of 
firms said they would implement damaging contingency plans in the absence of greater certainty on Brexit by 
December.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair has faced criticism after a video posted online apparently showed the airline's crew failing 
to take action to remove a passenger who launched a racist tirade against a fellow traveler.
The video, uploaded to social media by Briton David Lawrence, showed a man hurling racist insults at an elderly 
black woman sitting in the same row and demanding she move seats onboard a flight from Barcelona to London on 
Friday.
It wasn't clear what had prompted the quarrel. Lawrence told ITV the man abused both the woman and her 
daughter, but flight attendants failed to eject him from the flight.
The budget airline tweeted Sunday that it had seen the footage and reported the incident to police. It didn't provide 
further comment.

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) has been criticised for apparently failing

said Ryanair should have removed the man from the flight and threatened to boycott the airline.  Ryanair said it 'will 
not tolerate unruly behaviour like this'.  It has referred the matter to Essex Police.

In an industry where profits can vanish in a puff of pricey jet fuel, the rise of airline travel is pushing up pay for pilots. 
Their salaries were already growing. In the UK, their median weekly wage - at £1,726 gross - was 35 per cent 
higher last year than it was a decade ago. It is almost four times the average.
At Ryanair, senior pilots earn (EURO)140,000-(EURO)200,000, while at easyJet they can make up to £150,000. 
China's Sichuan Airlines, in a booming regional market, is advertising jobs with salaries of more than $313,000, 
plus $60,000 signing bonuses.
Air travel is on the up, while the supply of senior pilots is dropping. Although a wave of airline failures has brought 
crew to the market, with the labour market at its tightest for years, it is the newly unemployed pilots who have more 
bargaining power.
In October last year, Ryanair, which has more international passengers than any other airline, offered its pilots pay 
rises of 20 per cent or more following pilot shortages and a rostering failure that caused it to cancel thousands of 
flights. It noted in its annual results that it expected "the market for experienced pilots in Europe to remain tight for 
the next 12 months".
Sky-high demand pushes pilot salaries to fresh peaks; Airlines. Skills gap ; Buoyant travel market and lack of 
qualified recruits sees carriers battle for top s....
Norwegian, another of the big European budget airlines, also increased pay for pilots this year.
At the same time, Hungary's Wizz Air, which has gone from 40 aircraft in 2013 to 93, has been recruiting 
extensively.
"It is no secret that the market is tight," the airline said.
It said it had recruited 1,300 cabin crew and pilots in the past year, "the largest scale recruitment campaign in Wizz 
Air's history", and was still looking for more pilots.
This tightness of supply means pilots can be pretty certain of finding another job even if their employer collapses. 
When Monarch, a British airline, went into administration in 2017, 420 pilots lost their jobs. Of the 340 who were 
members of the British Airline Pilots' Association, 260 were re-employed within a year, said Wendy Pursey, Balpa's 
head of membership.
One former Monarch pilot said airlines were "desperate" for experienced people.
"It's like at Halloween. You've got hands clawing at you."
This pilot took one job offer and abandoned it a fortnight later when a better one came along.
"Every pilot that I know of from Monarch has got a job if they wanted one," he said, speaking on the fringes of a 
Balpa recruitment event at Gatwick last week.
The fact that the event happened is testament to demand, Ms Pursey said. "We couldn't have put this on three 
years ago - no one was recruiting."
This year, the amount of space it occupied increased by half to accommodate recruiters from Ryanair, British 
Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates and others. Of Balpa's 10,000 members, less than 3.5 per cent were looking for 
work, Ms Pursey said.
Fergus Rak, a senior pilot at Norwegian meeting potential recruits at the Gatwick fair, said the market "was tilting in 
favour of pilots. That shortfall that's been advertised for years is coming to fruition".
Asian airlines were offering significant sums, he said, to attract staff in a booming regional market.
One reason for the apparent skills shortage is demographics. In 2016, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority issued 
13,400 airline transport pilot licences, which permit commercial flying - up more than a quarter on 2000. However, 
the number of licences issued to those in their forties rose 37 per cent and more than doubled for those in their 
sixties. Meanwhile, licences for those in their thirties fell 4.7 per cent.
The problem is not the number of pilots but the number of experienced pilots, said Michel Treskin, head of pilot 
recruitment at OSM Aviation.
"You can't put a cadet in the righthand [first officer's] seat and expect them to be in the left-hand [captain's] seat in 
three years."
The cost of qualifying is one likely barrier for younger applicants. In general, pilots have to pay for their training, 
which can run to around £100,000, and often have to pay the airline that recruits them to train on its aircraft.
Pilots who cannot fly the Airbus aircraft that make up easyJet's fleet have to fund their own conversion training, 
while Wizz Air finances training up front in exchange for a three-year employment contract. Wizz Air runs its own 
training academy, with partially pre-financed fees and jobs available after qualification.
The former Monarch pilot said the airline had charged £30,000 upfront for conversion training, which he paid off 
£1,000 a month from his net wage.
Sky-high demand pushes pilot salaries to fresh peaks; Airlines. Skills gap ; Buoyant travel market and lack of

"It took me the entire time at Monarch to pay off the debt to get a job at Monarch," he said.
The industry is aware that the upfront training costs restrict who can afford to become a pilot, with consequences for 
diversity.
Robin Glover-Faure, who is in charge of training at L3, which trains pilots for easyJet, BA and others, said airlines 
were starting to bring back sponsorships and bursaries, and were lobbying for a system "like student loans, where 
the government provides guarantees".
At the fair, pilots and trainees were optimistic as they milled around stands and talked to airline captains.
Aurora Chiarini, about to embark on training, said she would be looking for a job in a year's time, and Hemal Gandhi 
said he had applied for one job this week and already been booked for an assessment next week. If demand 
continues to grow, Ms Chiarini and Mr Gandhi can feel sure about their future in the skies.

Ryanair has reached a deal with Portuguese pilots on contentious seniority and home base issues, following similar 
agreements with their counterparts in Britain and Italy this week, the Irish budget airline said on Friday.
Ryanair also expects to sign a recognition agreement with the union representing Spanish pilots shortly as it seeks 
to end a damaging series of strikes that have hurt its business.
Ryanair has struggled with labor relations since it bowed to pressure to recognize unions for the first time almost a 
year ago, contributing to a rare profit warning this month and a warning of worse to come if strikes continue.
It said the Portuguese deal - covering issues such as leave allocation and promotion - would allow talks with 
Portugal's SPAC union on a full collective labor agreement to start by the end of the month.
A recognition agreement in Spain will also pave the way for rapid negotiations on a full labor agreement with 
Spanish pilot union SEPLA, Europe's largest low-cost carrier added.
Ryanair signed its first recognition agreement with pilots in its largest market of Britain earlier this year where it has 
avoided industrial action. Pilots in Italy approved a collective labor agreement in August.
"These signed agreements with our pilot unions in Portugal, the UK, Italy and shortly in Spain, demonstrate the 
considerable progress we're making in concluding union agreements with our people in our major EU markets," 
Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
"I expect that these agreements in Spain, and Portugal in particular, will encourage the cabin crew unions in both 
those countries... to quickly conclude cabin crew agreements."
Ryanair claims progress in relations with European pilots
Cabin crew in Spain and Portugal took part in a walkout across six European countries last month that disrupted the 
plans of more than 40,000 passengers in one of Ryanair's worse strikes to date.
Two Belgian unions representing Ryanair cabin crew warned of several more days of strikes in Europe before the 
end of the year if Ryanair does not change its position in negotiations. (Reuters)

Ryanair will press ahead with plans to move Polish staff on to self-employed contracts, Ryanair's Chief Marketing 
Officer Kenny Jacobs said in an interview with Reuters.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, is already trying to cope with an industrial relations revolt across the 
region, with pilots and cabin crew staging strikes in several countries over employment conditions.
In Poland, a union representing Polish cabin crew has refused to sign the new contracts which the company's local 
subsidiary wants to introduce.
But Jacobs said the new contract reflected the local market.
"It's the local type of contract, the same as (national Polish carrier) LOT and other airlines," Jacobs said.
Many Polish Ryanair staff are currently on contracts provided by the parent company, but are being asked to 
transfer to the new contracts as Ryanair's main operation in Poland is handed to Ryanair Sun, a local subsidiary.
Paulo Conceicao, secretary of the Polish cabin crew union, CWR, who works as cabin crew at Ryanair, told Reuters 
that the self-employed contract would mean staff would lose important rights such as sick pay and maternity leave.
"All the rights embedded into your labour contract are liquidated," he said.
Analysts have said that the transfer to self-employed contracts gives airlines more flexibility and will save them 
money.
Ryanair makes no concessions to Polish union demands on contracts
Jacobs said staff would get higher salaries as a result of the shift and could also be relocated elsewhere in Europe 
if they are not satisfied with the contracts.
Ryanair employs 400 cabin crew in Poland, according to the union, of which about three-quarters are union 
members.
Ryanair staff have received support from unions representing workers from Poland's state-run airline LOT, who 
went on strike on Thursday over working conditions.
"We will work together (with Ryanair's union) to fight self-employment. We plan on raising this on the European and 
national stage," Agnieszka Szelagowska, a leader at LOT's union told a news conference on Wednesday.
Ryanair plans to continue its expansion and hiring in Central and Eastern Europe, Jacobs said. (Reuters)

FINANCIAL TIMES AIG EXPECTS UP TO $1.7BN IN CATASTROPHE LOSSES Insurer American International 
Group said yesterday it expects to report third quarter pre-tax catastrophe losses of as much as $1.7bn (£1.31bn), 
sending shares lower in after-hours trade. AIG said losses associated with Hurricane Florence, which battered the 
Carolinas last month, multiple events in Japan, including Typhoons Jebi and Trami, and revisions to loss estimates 
on the California mudslide would result in pretax losses, net of reinsurance, of between $1.5bn to $1.7bn.
AMEX BOOSTS FULL-YEAR EARNINGS FORECASTS American Express nudged up its fullyear earnings per 
share guidance on the back of customer spending growth. The card company's third-quarter results came in slightly 
ahead of estimates, with revenue at $10.1bn (£7.76bn).
THE TIMES BNP PARIBAS LOSE LONDON JOBS AS PROFITS FALL France's largest lender has become the 
first to cut jobs at its investment banking business as a result of the market turmoil that has hit profits at trading 
desks in the City. BNP Paribas told its London-based staff this week that it would make up to 40 redundancies and 
would cut back on hiring as it tries to boost profits after a poor year.
LEAHY SAYS LEWIS PUTS TESCO 'BACK ON TRACK' Sir Terry Leahy has endorsed Dave Lewis, Tesco's chief

crew of "faking" a photograph depicting staff being forced to sleep in their crew room, in the latest bizarre twist to 
the low-cost airline's battle with its unions. A photo was posted on social media on Sunday showing staff bedding 
down in Malaga airport. Representatives for the staff later admitted that the photo was a gesture of protest".

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. stocks were fluctuating on Friday and the pound held 
largely flat after European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said disagreements over the Ireland border could lead to 
a breakdown in the Brexit discussions.  Italian budget concerns, rising geopolitical tensions and weak Chinese data 
also added to investor concerns over global growth outlook. 
  The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 10 points or 0.15 percent at 7,037 in choppy trade after closing 0.4 percent 
lower on Thursday.  Acacia Mining slumped 11.5 percent after its third-quarter net earnings declined 26 percent 
from last year.   Man Group edged up half a percent after it unveiled plans to repurchase up to $100 million of 
shares.   Intercontinental Hotels plunged 6.3 percent after revenue growth slowed in the third quarter.   Low-cost 
airline Ryanair dropped 1 percent after it signed an agreement with the Portuguese pilot union SPAC to cover all of 
its directly employed pilots in Portugal.  Retail property developer Intu Properties soared 12 percent. The company 
said  it was considering a 215p a share takeover offer from a consortium backed by Peel Group, the Olayan Group 
and Brookfield Property Group.  In economic releases, the U.K. budget deficit reached its lowest September level in 
11 years, data from the Office for National Statistics showed.  Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector 
banks stood at GBP 4.1 billion, which was GBP 0.8 billion less than in September 2017. This was the lowest 
September deficit since 2007.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary warned yesterday that a hard Brexit may ground planes for up to three weeks, on 
the day the Prime Minister headed to Brussels for a crunch meeting with EU leaders to break the impasse in the 
negotiations.
O'Leary said that while the grounding of planes for a "week, two weeks, three weeks" would be "painful", the airline 
would survive.
O'Leary has previously warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, in which the UK would crash out of the EU on 
terms set by the World Trade Organisation.
He warned last month that the EU had given no assurances to the UK that an agreement would be in place that 
would allow flights to continue when Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.
The budget airline has endured a turbulent summer of strikes over pay from pilots and cabin crew, which drove it to 
downgrade its profit guidance by 12 per cent earlier this month. The airline now expects full-year profit to be 
between (EURO)1.1bn and (EURO)1.2bn.
O'Leary has said he is "hopeful and optimistic" that the issue of strikes will be resolved by Christmas.
Earlier this month it was revealed that the EU's aviation regulator rejected British calls for a joint nodeal Brexit 
transition plan in July. The EU said it needed more clarity on the course of the Brexit talks.

Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel
Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel
dpa international (Englischer Dienst)

Dateline: Berlin (dpa) - 
Body
Dublin-based Ryanair is to make Berlin's Tegel airport its 10th base in Germany from April next year, taking over 
four planes already stationed there by its partner airline Laudamotion, the budget carrier announced on 
Wednesday.
Making the announcement in Berlin, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sketched out plans to expand the 
airline's routes, but said he expected no growth in Germany, partly because of continuing conflict with German 
unions over pay and conditions.
For as long as there was no clarity with the unions, there would be no further investment in additional planes, he 
said.
Ryanair owns three quarters of Laudamotion, which has taken over take-off and landing slots at Tegel from the 
bankrupt Air Berlin subsidiary Niki.
Ryanair recently announced the closure of its base in Bremen in north-western Germany, where two planes are 
based. It also said it would withdraw two of the five planes it has at Weeze on the Dutch border, in what German 
trade union officials saw as a "declaration of war."
O'Leary denied this, insisting that fuel prices were to blame. "Oil is at 85 dollars, you idiots," said the chief 
executive, who has a reputation for combative language. Further rises in the price could lead to further closures, he 
added.
Nevertheless, O'Leary said talks with the Verdi trade union and the pilot's Cockpit association were going well, with 
meetings set for this week and next and agreement possible by Christmas.
Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel
In charge at Ryanair since 1993, O'Leary has expanded the former loss-maker to being Europe's largest budget 
airline. He indicated his intention to step down within three years.

Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel
Ryanair to create base at Berlin's Tegel

       BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Dublin-based Ryanair is to make Berlin's Tegel airport its 10th base in Germany from April 
next year, taking over four planes already stationed there by its partner airline Laudamotion, the budget carrier 
announced on Wednesday.  Making the announcement in Berlin, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sketched 
out plans to expand the airline's routes, but said he expected no growth in Germany, partly because of continuing 
conflict with German unions over pay and conditions.  For as long as there was no clarity with the unions, there 
would be no further investment in additional planes, he said. 
 Ryanair owns three quarters of Laudamotion, which has taken over take-off and landing slots at Tegel from the 
bankrupt Air Berlin subsidiary Niki.  Ryanair recently announced the closure of its base in Bremen in north-western 
Germany, where two planes are based. It also said it would withdraw two of the five planes it has at Weeze on the 
Dutch border, in what German trade union officials saw as a 'declaration of war.'  O'Leary denied this, insisting that 
fuel prices were to blame. 'Oil is at 85 dollars, you idiots,' said the chief executive, who has a reputation for 
combative language. Further rises in the price could lead to further closures, he added.  Nevertheless, O'Leary said 
talks with the Verdi trade union and the pilot's Cockpit association were going well, with meetings set for this week 
and next and agreement possible by Christmas.  In charge at Ryanair since 1993, O'Leary has expanded the 
former loss-maker to being Europe's largest budget airline. He indicated his intention to step down within three 
years.      Copyright dpa

The EU's top transport official has signalled she will not bend Europe's laws to help IAG, the Anglo-Spanish airline 
group that risks falling foul of post-Brexit ownership rules, if the UK leaves the bloc without a deal.
Violeta Bulc, EU transport commissioner, told the Financial Times in an interview that there was no reason for 
airlines to be caught out by a hard Brexit, since they have had fair warning to make sure their corporate 
arrangements fit EU rules.
These stipulate that European carriers must be more than 50 per cent EUowned and controlled. Some companies - 
including IAG, which owns British Airways - have yet to ensure they will reach the threshold after Brexit, when UK 
nationals will no longer count towards the tally. Those that fail to do so will risk losing their EU operating rights.
The risk of a hard Brexit "has been known since the first day the British people voted to exit ... We've been asking 
everyone to take it seriously and to prepare for different scenarios," Ms Bulc, a former telecoms executive and 
Slovenian deputy prime minister, said.
"If there is no deal [between the EU and UK], I don't need to point out which side the EU will be on," she said. "It's 
Spain that we will have in mind."
Ms Bulc gave no further details, but her spokesman later said that in the case of "conflicting interests" after Brexit, 
the transport commissioner would help EU authorities to bring European airlines' "ownership and control structures 
in line with EU law".
EU says it will not bend rules for BA owner in no-deal Brexit Airline licences
Most airlines have provisions to retain their licences by forcibly buying out non-EU investors. Dublin-based Ryanair 
and UK-based easyJet plan to use this mechanism to hit the ownership target in the event of a hard Brexit.
But IAG, which owns British Airways and runs the world's busiest long-haul route with its London-New York flights, 
faces a dilemma. Any bilateral US-UK aviation agreement would be likely to require the company, which is 
Spanishregistered and has diverse global shareholders, to be majority-owned and controlled by UK parties. In this 
event, it could fall out of the existing US-EU deal after Brexit, losing its European operating rights and reducing its 
carriers' access to the US from the bloc.
IAG told the FT: "We have every confidence that the US and UK will sign a deal that is in everyone's interests. All 
parties have a shared interest in ensuring that existing rights continue under new bilateral arrangements. This 
allows airlines on both sides of the Atlantic to operate existing services and seek to develop new ones."
Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, has previously rejected fears that the group could face post-Brexit ownership 
problems as "nonsense".
Aside from Brexit, Ms Bulc, who was confirmed as transport commissioner in 2014, has found her priorities 
confounded by unco-operative member states and worker strikes. Issues at the top of her list include improving 
crossborder transport and pursuing the Single European Sky policy, which aims to create a unified EU air traffic 
control area to lift capacity and cut disruption.
But the Single European Sky has stalled, partly because national air traffic management agencies are unwilling to 
cede autonomy, and this summer Europe experienced its worst congestion on record. In July, airline passengers 
experienced more than 135,000 minutes - or almost 94 days - of inflight delays on average each day, more than 
double the July 2017 figure.
Eurocontrol, which compiled the data and co-ordinates national air traffic management agencies, put the troubles 
down to lack of capacity and strikes.

 Anglo-Spanish airline International Consolidated Airlines Group SA could lose its EU operating licence in a no-deal 
Brexit scenario, according to the Financial Times.
Under EU law, IAG, which owns both British Airways and Spain's Iberia, must be more than 50% EU-owned in 
order to maintain its operating licence within the bloc. In the event of a hard Brexit, IAG's UK nationals will stop 
counting toward this percentage. 
However, reducing its percentage of UK ownership could cause IAG to run afoul of US operating requirements on 
transatlantic routes.
Violeta Bulc, transport commissioner, was interviewed by the FT and told the newspaper than the airline has no 
reason to be caught out, as it has had ample warning.
"We've been asking everyone to take it seriously and to prepare for different scenarios," Bulc told the FT.
"If there is no deal [between the EU and UK], I don't need to point out which side the EU will be on," she added. "It's 
Spain that we will have in mind."
IAG also owns regional carrier Vueling in Spain and Aer Lingus in Ireland, which like Spain will remain part of the 
EU.
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh has previously dismissed fears around post-Brexit ownership, according to the 
newspaper.
"We have every confidence that the US and UK will sign a deal that is in everyone's interests. All parties have a 
shared interest in ensuring that existing rights continue under new bilateral arrangements. This allows airlines on 
both sides of the Atlantic to operate existing services and seek to develop new ones," IAG told the FT.
According to the Financial Times a majority of airlines, such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, have 
provisions enabling them to forcibly buy out non-EU investors to keep their licences.

However, the FT said that because IAG runs "the world's busiest long-haul route" with its flights from London to 
New York, any agreement between the US and UK would likely require the company to be majority-owned and 
controlled by UK parties.
https://www.ft.com/content/d7e6f5f2-cd3c-11e8-9fe5-24ad351828ab
Last Thursday, the UK Competition & Markets Authority announced that it will probe the transatlantic pact between 
IAG and American Airlines Group Inc in relation to this route.
Following an EU competition investigation in 2010, commitments were signed in relation to routes from London to 
New York, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, and Boston. These commitments are set to expire in 2020, making landing and 
take-off slots available to competitors.
The CMA said it had based its decision to review the deal on the fact that the European Commission may no longer 
be responsible for UK competition in 2020 once Brexit occurs.
Shares in IAG were up 0.8% at 587.40 pence on Tuesday.

Viral Photo Of Airline Crew Sleeping On Airport Floor 'Staged,' Ryanair Says

Oct 16, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A photo showing 
cabin crew employees of Ryanair sleeping on the floor, which recently went viral, has prompted outrage on social 
media. However, the airline defended itself against the backlash, insisting that the picture was staged and not real. 
One of the people who shared the photo on social media was ex-Ryanair pilot Jim Atkinson.The much-talked-about 
photo allegedly taken on Oct. 
13, after four Portugal-bound Ryanair flights were diverted due to the tropical thunderstorm Leslie, was originally 
shared by the Facebook page of 'Ryanair Must Change.' The picture showed six members of the airline's staff 
curled up on a carpet on the floor of Malaga Airport, Spain, next to printers and other office supplies. While some of 
them used their blazers as pillows under their head, others were seen shielding their eyes with their arms as they 
slept. 'Upon arrival to Malaga airport, the 24 crew [8 pilots and 16 cabin crew]were placed in a room, without the 
minimum rest facilities, where the Crew that are based on that airport perform their briefings and where Ryanair has 
their Malaga offices.The 24 crew members were there since 01h30 until 06:00 local time [7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. 
EDT]without access to food, drinks and even a place to sit down, as there were only 8 seats available for the 24 
crew,' Ryanair Must Change said in a separate Facebook post[1]. Ryanair said in a statement to the Irish 
Mirror[2]:'This picture is clearly staged and no crew 'slept on the floor'." 'Due to storms in Porto [on Oct.13]a number 
of flights diverted to Malaga and as this was a Spanish national holiday, hotels were fully booked. The crew spent a 
short period of time in the crew room before being moved to a VIP lounge, and returned to Porto the next day [none 
of the crew operated flights],' the statement said. Furthermore, the airline's Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew 
added the company apologized to the crew member for being unable to organize hotels for them to stay in. 
'Unfortunately all hotels were completely booked out in Malaga. The storm created huge damage in Portugal. Later 
after this the crew moved to VIP lounge. Apologies to the crew we could not find accommodation,' he said, Mirror 
Online[3] reported. SNPVAC union, which represents Portuguese airline crews, pushed back against Ryanair's 
claims of the photo being staged, saying the staff had 'no other choice than to attempt to rest on the room's floor.' It 
added that while the airline crew was eventually allowed to access the VIP lounge of the airport and stay there for 
another four hours, they did not receive any refreshments then too. Atkinson also shared the screenshot of a chat[4] 
he had with an anonymous Ryanair airport staff member, who alleged there were some expensive hotels available 
and the company simply chose not to bear the cost. 'Off season? No hotels?!?! There are thousands of hotels along 
the gold cost [sic]. All hotels sold out that probably cost less than 35 euro a night and gave a discount for taking the 
no breakfast tariff!' the staff member wrote. A picture shows Ryanair logo as passengers board inside a Ryanair

Boeing has made good on a promise to ramp up deliveries of its narrowbody, after handing over 61 examples in 
September.The bumper delivery total represents a significant turnaround for the company, which had struggled 
over recent months to ship its planned number of aircraft, due to supply-chain bottlenecks.A total of 29 737s were 
delivered from Boeing’s Renton, Washington, assembly site in July, rising to 48 in August. Both figures were below 
its goal of handing over 52 of the aircraft per month this year.As deliveries slowed, company executives remained 
resolute, insisting that Boeing had a recovery plan in place and that shipments would increase in the later part of 
this year.Boeing’s figures show that its September shipments included 39 737NGs and 22 Max-series examples. 
The leading recipients were Ryanair, with eight aircraft, and went to China Eastern Airlines and Southwest Airlines, 
including the US carrier’s last-ever NG-series aircraft. 
Meanwhile, the company also handed over a total of 18 787s during September: more than any in other month in at 
least the last year, according to the company’s latest delivery report. Its overall monthly total of 87 units also 
included three 777-300ER widebodies, and in the freighter sector, a trio of 777Fs and lone examples of the 747-8F 
and 767F.Boeing had delivered a total of 568 commercial aircraft this year as of the end of September. It must hand 
over another 242 airframes by year-end to achieve its 2018 target of 810-815 units.

BACK in July 2016, Theresa May launched her campaign for leadership of the Conservative party by promising 
radical action on foreign takeovers of British businesses.
In the wake of Kraft's takeover of Cadbury and Pfizer's failed bid for AstraZeneca, May promised to defend workers 
and local communities from transient shareholders who, she said, were more concerned with asset stripping and 
avoiding tax than improving Britain's economy.
Her government quietly began to make good on that promise. A consultation that closes today proposes sweeping 
new powers to allow the state to intervene in or block outright hundreds of mergers every year that are currently 
approved without incident, ostensibly on national security grounds.
The powers would increase the number of mergers subject to a national security review from fewer than 10 in the 
past 15 years to 200 per year. It is predicted that around 50 cases a year will be remedied or blocked, which would 
make the new regime more than double the size of the existing mergers caseload handled by the Competition and 
Markets Authority.
It is hard to believe that this is really about national security. The government already has powers to intervene, and 
has not highlighted any existing takeover or merger where it feels that these did not go far enough.
And May's government has shown repeatedly that it will use the existing national security test to extract 
concessions on other grounds, just as other governments do around the world.
May's new merger powers would be a hostile takeover by the state
Melrose's takeover of GKN earlier this year was threatened with a national security review - until Melrose made 
commitments on jobs, treatment of suppliers, and GKN's pension fund. These had nothing to do with national 
security - the takeover did not even involve a foreign business.
Softbank's takeover of Arm Holdings, a British chipmaker, was threatened with a similar review until Softbank 
agreed to create 1,700 new jobs in the UK.
In the US, Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium were imposed on national security grounds. And when 
France blocked the takeover of Danone by PepsiCo, it did so on the basis that Danone - the yoghurt company - was 
a "strategic industry" that should not be owned by a US company.
Evidence both at home and from abroad provides indications that these powers would be used for protectionism - 
not just to protect national security. And in the end, the British public would be the losers.
Foreign investment into markets increases competition - just think of how much Ryanair and other foreign airlines 
have cut prices across Europe.
Foreign takeovers of domestic firms often clear out bad management and transform failing companies into leaner, 
more competitive ones - look at Jaguar's turnaround after it was taken over by Tata. There is empirical evidence 
that foreign-owned firms operating in the UK are more productive and better managed.
Successful takeovers can create jobs - by saving Jaguar, Tata protected 35,000 jobs in Britain and created 
thousands of new ones - but it's true that sometimes there are job losses as well. But the alternative is economic 
sclerosis, with failing businesses kept on their feet just to protect jobs, tying up capital and labour that could be used 
productively elsewhere.
Special interest groups would be the main beneficiaries of this system. The union Unite revealed its strategy during 
the GKN-Melrose deal, arguing that, conveniently, protecting the jobs of its members was the only way to safeguard 
national security.
Domestic firms would use the rules to lobby the government to prevent rivals from being taken over and 
restructured, if doing so meant injecting some competition into an undercompetitive market.
All of this would undermine foreign direct investment into Britain (currently third highest of anywhere in the world), 
and mean lower productivity growth and worse living standards. Once powers like these are granted, it is hard to 
reverse them. These proposals were put out in the middle of the summer, and are concluding just as the Brexit 
process reaches its final, most intense phase - and they have received little public debate.
The government should delay this consultation until after Brexit, and reopen it then to give time for proper public 
scrutiny.

Ryanair accused of divide and conquer approach to union talks across Europe
Ryanair accused of divide and conquer approach to union talks across

Ryanair could put an end to its workers' strikes if the airline were "sincere" about contract negotiations, a senior 
union official has said.
Philip von Schöppenthau, secretarygeneral of the European Cockpit Association, which brings together 36 national 
pilots' unions and represents more than 38,000 pilots, said: "Ryanair could finish everything by the end of the year if 
they wanted to, if they were sincere and if they stopped playing one union against another."
Strikes and the resulting cost of compensating customers have been a thorn in Ryanair's side and, together with the 
high price of oil, they caused it to issue a profit warning this month.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier has been negotiating collective agreements with each of its largest pilot and cabin 
crew unions across Europe and has faced a summer of strikes as some talks soured. Unions have reported 
presenting identical terms to Ryanair and receiving different responses.
Mr von Schöppenthau accused Ryanair of "a disguised way of punishing pilots for engaging in the fundamental 
right to strike" by announcing it would shut or trim bases in Germany and the Netherlands, where workers have 
been particularly restive. It was a "striking coincidence" that the announcement shortly followed strike action, he 
said.
Ryanair accused of divide and conquer approach to union talks across Europe
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, has denied targeting bases because of strike activity and describes them as 
lowperforming and expensive.
Ryanair agreed to recognise unions in 2017 but has struggled to reach terms with most. Mr O'Leary this month said 
he had reluctantly come to accept unionisation, despite once saying "hell would freeze over" before he did so.
Mr von Schöppenthau said Ryanair lacked the capacity to negotiate so many agreements at once, echoing the view 
of the British Airline Pilots' Association. He added it was also "a question of political will of the Ryanair board and 
leadership". Swift resolution to industrial disputes was in the interest of investors, executives and staff, he said.
Ryanair said: "Since we have now negotiated [collective labour agreements] with both cabin crew and pilot unions 
in Italy, and also signed agreements both with cabin crew and pilots in Ireland, there are clearly no lack of skills or 
culture issues in Ryanair."

Anyone feeling jaded, jejune or just plain past it at work can read this book in a morning and feel revived. If you 
manage to do even a 10th of the things that Conley suggests, which include collaborating with others, taking a long 
look at your core values, going into a new company as an intern and being curious about what you find there, then 
you may be able to shake offyour malaise and reinvent yourself as a "modern elder" of the title. As Conley tells it, 
there are opportunities galore for anyone seeking later-life adventure and reinvention.
Conley was the founder of a US boutique hotel chain and is now a strategic consultant for Airbnb as well as an 
author. He knows how to write and his enthusiasm keeps this book zipping along.
Conley's pitch to generation X-ers and baby boomers is that they should cast offtheir egos and leadership burdens 
and think more like mentors.
There is a lot of Californian psychobabble in here that some may find off-putting but the general vibe is irrepressible 
fun and the book is useful. There is a great index with further reading suggestions, films to watch and inspiring TED 
talks.
Hannah Fry, associate professor in the maths of cities at University College London and a presenter of science 
documentaries, is a clear guide to the omnipresent algorithms. Hello World: How to be a human in the Age of the 
Machine is a sweeping introduction to humans' impact on algorithms and algorithms' impact on human behaviour.
Words of wisdom From becoming a 'modern elder', to the unfinished story of Ryanair 's colourful leader; titles 
our writers recommend
Take for example the residents of Scunthorpe in the north of England, who were unable to set up AOL accounts 
due to the tech company's profanity block (the second to fifth letters of the town's name raised the computer's 
hackles), a good example of both technology creating hurdles but also the coders' oversight. Fry takes the reader 
through diverse subjects of politics, crime, art and medicine.
Ultimately she argues not that algorithms are inherently good or bad but that they need to take into account the 
human at every stage. The best ones, she writes, are those that "recognise our habit of over-trusting the output of a 
machine, while embracing their own flaws and wearing their uncertainty proudly front and centre".
Imagination is a "universal human talent", yet according to Beth Comstock, former vice-chair of General Electric, 
businesses are often failing to use it. She calls this the "imagination gap, where possibility and options for the future 
go to die".
Comstock draws on her 25 years' experience at GE, where she was head of innovation and marketing, to provide a 
guide on how organisations can avoid failure and irrelevance by learning to navigate today's relentless pace of 
change and how they can open their culture and innovate more quickly when faced with disruption.
She believes that when it comes to reinvention there is a systematic approach that can be applied to virtually any 
company in any industry.
Split into five sections, including "agitated inquiry" (how innovation comes from seeking out tension, not avoiding it) 
and "story craft" (a company's successful innovation comes from creating a new narrative), her experience shows a 
large company can adjust, experiment and learn to think differently.
In boiling the story of his life and career down into a few digestible lessons, Chambers has plenty of raw material. 
He enjoyed 20 years at the top of Cisco Systems, which included surviving the aftermath of the first dotcom bust, 
when the technology company lost 80 per cent of its share price and a quarter of its customers.
The lessons include familiar ones about how to reinvent the business to ride through disruption while maintaining 
the underlying mission. Chambers' approach can be a little cheesy, not to say contradictory. He pays tribute to the 
team around him at Cisco, hailing their "passion, discipline, innovation and teamwork of Cisco's people" and paints 
himself as a humble West Virginian.
But he also personalises the success the company achieved and puts himself at the centre of the tale as a 
worldconquering leader.
There are other difficult balancing acts. Chambers not only focuses on big-company challenges that Cisco faced, 
notably the acquisition and integration of 180 companies, he also tries to show how to apply his lessons to start-
ups. Presumably, these will include enterprises that will in future try to bring down the big company he once 
headed.
Who will rule artificial intelligence, the most strategic area of future technology: the US, or China? That is the 
question that Chinese investor Kai-Fu Lee, the man who launched Google China, sets out to answer in AI 
Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.
The answer rests on whether you believe AI depends on innovation, in which the US still leads, or implementation 
of existing technologies and the leveraging of the world's largest potential data trove - the Middle Kingdom.
In a world of colourless corporate leaders, Ryanair's aggressive, mouthy chief executive provides catnip for 
journalists. Cooper, an award-winning Irish writer and reporter, makes the most of the opportunity to dissect his 
colourful subject.
Cooper's book is as much an analysis of the behind-the-scenes drama at the lowcost airline - for example, his 
turbulent relationship with founder Tony Ryan - as it is a review of Michael O'Leary's wellchronicled public 
Words of wisdom From becoming a 'modern elder', to the unfinished story of Ryanair 's colourful leader; titles

performances. O'Leary emerges as a taker of calculated risks, a wily strategist and an uncompromising 
micromanager, with as many enemies as supporters.
The unanswered question is whether time has run out for the entrepreneurial Irishman. As the author writes, this is 
an unfinished story, as this summer's series of strikes at the airline has shown. Despite suggestions he may have 
mellowed, O'Leary is still the pugnacious, money-motivated scrapper of Ryanair's early years, says Cooper. The 
difference is that he now heads a far larger and more complex organisation facing unprecedented challenges to the 
model that he has always championed.
We are the first generation who, rather than having the need to fill time and space, have the need to create it. This 
somewhat overwhelming concept is the basis of business consultant and former political adviser Derek Draper's 
practical book on how professionals can stop feeling rushed and "create space", in order to feel, perform and 
connect better with others.
The book is divided into five chapters: one each exploring how to reflect, build stronger relationships, deliver at work 
and grow as a person, with a final guide on how to set goals and achieve them. Full of models and tools, the book 
makes for an easy bedside read for someone looking to change the way they work.
Thought exercises and tips are interspersed with 12 real-life case studies from Draper's decade-long experience 
coaching executives. These anecdotes are unnecessarily protracted at times, but the book's structure makes it 
easy to jump between stories and engage with those most relevant to you.

EasyJet Boss Predicts More Airline Failures After Primera Air Collapse
EasyJet Boss Predicts More Airline Failures After Primera Air Collapse

 More airlines are likely to fail due to rising fuel costs, the boss of easyJet has warned.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said "weaker players" face increasing pressure amid the price of oil reaching 
around USD85 a barrel, compared with USD69 in April.
He made the comments just nine days after the collapse of Primera Air, which left thousands of passengers 
scrambling to find alternative flights home and customers with future bookings having to seek refunds from credit 
and debit card companies.
Lundgren expects more consolidation in the aviation industry, with successful airlines or airline groups taking over 
struggling carriers.
He told the annual convention of travel trade association Abta in Seville, Spain: "The fuel price being up there and 
perhaps continuing to increase will put some of those weaker players in a more difficult situation.
"I think there will be a consolidation from the fact that we're going to see more failures."
In April, British Airways owner IAG acquired a 5% stake in Norwegian with a view to starting takeover discussions.
Norwegian has struggled to contain costs amid its rapid expansion, and had around GBP2 billion of net debt at the 
end of last year.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary recently predicted it would "go bust this winter", but the Scandinavian carrier insisted 
his comment has "no root in reality".
EasyJet bought Air Berlin's operations at the German capital's Tegel airport in December and is in discussions 
about taking over cash-strapped Italian airline Alitalia.
But Lundgren insisted easyJet has "plenty of room to grow organically" and will not rely on mergers and acquisitions 
to expand.
EasyJet Boss Predicts More Airline Failures After Primera Air Collapse
He noted that the Luton-based carrier is the second largest airline in Europe but "only has 10% market share".

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said he is "hopeful and optimistic" that the airline will not be damaged 
further by strikes with its pilots and cabin crew this year. O'Leary, who has previously said the airline will put up with 
strikes to defend its low-cost business model, said: "I am hopeful and optimistic that we are making real progress 
with the unions and that we won't have any further damage to the business this year." Last week, Ryanair revised 
down its profits for the full year by 12 per cent following a series of summer strikes by pilots and cabin crew. In 
2017, the airline faced ongoing cancellations after a row with pilots.

suffer a heart attack about 15 years earlier and it is "inevitable" that such testing will soon become routine on the 
NHS.

Ryanair will not be able to improve relations between pilots and management as long as Michael O'Leary is in 
charge, a trade union leader has said.
John Moore, head of industrial relations at the British Airline Pilots' Association, Balpa, issued the warning as he 
accused the boss of the low-cost airline of creating an "atmosphere of distrust". Mr Moore added: "If you asked one 
of our members, they would say that this does come from the top, that things will only improve if there is regime 
change."
He confirmed that negotiations between the union and the airline had not made "any meaningful progress on pay", 
prompting an unsuccessful conclusion to the first round of talks and bringing strike action a step closer. "It's 
possible that by December, we will have exhausted the internal process and we would then need to consider 
whether or not to go ahead with an official ballot for industrial action," said Mr Moore.
Ryanair said a change in Balpa's negotiating team had caused delays to discussion of written proposals the 
company sent the union in August. "These delays lie with Balpa, not Ryanair."
British workers make up the largest contingent of Ryanair's pilots, according to research by investment company 
Bernstein: 880 out of almost 4,300.
Union urges Ryanair 'regime change' to improve relations with its pilots Airlines
Ryanair has suffered a summer of strikes across Europe, including five days by Irish pilots and the two days of co-
ordinated pan-European action by cabin crew.
The airline agreed to recognise unions in late 2017 following a rostering failure that caused it to cancel thousands of 
flights, but has struggled to reach terms with most of its unions.
Last week Mr O'Leary said that he had reluctantly come to accept unionisation, despite once saying "hell would 
freeze over" before he recognised them.
"I have two stances: we will ultimately be unionised ... and I have accepted that as reality, but for as long as we can 
postpone unionisation, we would try to to postpone unionisation. The two aren't contradictory," Mr O'Leary said.
Union members' strikes, the resulting compensation costs and the high price of oil led the company to issue a profit 
warning at the start of October, cutting its forecast from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-
(EURO)1.2bn.
Mr Moore said "objectively, there's very little between the two sides", since the union was proposing some terms 
which mirrored Ryanair's agreement with its Irish pilots.
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said Ryanair's "blank slate" when it came to agreements with trade unions 
meant "the union has an incentive to push for the largest possible scope for the agreement".

accused the boss of the low-cost airline of creating an "atmosphere of distrust". Mr Moore added: "If you asked one 
of our members, they would say that this does come from the top, that things will only improve if there is regime 
change."
He confirmed that negotiations between the union and the airline had not made "any meaningful progress on pay", 
prompting an unsuccessful conclusion to the first round of talks and bringing strike action a step closer. "It's 
possible that by December, we will have exhausted the internal process and we would then need to consider 
whether or not to go ahead with an official ballot for industrial action," said Mr Moore.
Ryanair said a change in Balpa's negotiating team had caused delays to discussion of written proposals the 
company sent the union in August. "These delays lie with Balpa, not Ryanair."
British workers make up the largest contingent of Ryanair's pilots, according to research by investment company 
Bernstein: 880 out of almost 4,300.
Union urges Ryanair 'regime change' to improve relations with its pilots Airlines
Ryanair has suffered a summer of strikes across Europe, including five days by Irish pilots and the two days of co-
ordinated pan-European action by cabin crew.
The airline agreed to recognise unions in late 2017 following a rostering failure that caused it to cancel thousands of 
flights, but has struggled to reach terms with most of its unions.
Last week Mr O'Leary said that he had reluctantly come to accept unionisation, despite once saying "hell would 
freeze over" before he recognised them.
"I have two stances: we will ultimately be unionised ... and I have accepted that as reality, but for as long as we can 
postpone unionisation, we would try to to postpone unionisation. The two aren't contradictory," Mr O'Leary said.
Union members' strikes, the resulting compensation costs and the high price of oil led the company to issue a profit 
warning at the start of October, cutting its forecast from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-
(EURO)1.2bn.
Mr Moore said "objectively, there's very little between the two sides", since the union was proposing some terms 
which mirrored Ryanair's agreement with its Irish pilots.
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said Ryanair's "blank slate" when it came to agreements with trade unions 
meant "the union has an incentive to push for the largest possible scope for the agreement".

Ryanair will not be able to improve relations between pilots and management as long as Michael O'Leary is in

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary is "hopeful and optimistic" that industrial relations issues will not damage 
the business further this year, but he said it would not be helpful to put a timeline on resolving the issue completely.
"I am hopeful and optimistic that we are making real progress with the unions and that we won't have any further 
damage to the business this year," O'Leary told Reuters in an interview ahead of a news briefing in Brussels.
Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12% last week and warned that worse may follow if recent strikes 
across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings. (Reuters)

Former Ryanair deputy chief Howard Millar has disclosed that a newly-established fund, which aims to invest in 
used single-aisle aircraft, is set to launch an initial public offering.
The company, Sirius Aircraft Leasing Fund, is a Guernsey-registered entity. Guernsey’s corporate registry indicates 
it was registered on 27 September.
Millar is the chief executive of Sirius Aviation Capital Holdings, a company which will act as investment advisor to 
the new fund.
The proposed initial public offering has a $250 million fundraising target with admission to the London stock 
exchange.
Sirius Aircraft Leasing Fund states that it believes an “attractive opportunity” exists in the market for acquiring, 
leasing and selling of used single-aisle aircraft.
It argues that there is a liquid market for such aircraft, with traditional lessors disposing of older airframes to 
maintain age profiles. Major lessors sold more than 300 aircraft last year, the company says.
At the same time, says Sirius, there is a “growing demand” for used aircraft, creating a liquid secondary market, 
with operators such as British Airways and Iberia parent IAG, as well as Lufthansa, picking up older airframes.
“For lessees there can be significant cost savings in leasing used single-aisle aircraft compared [with] new aircraft,” 
it adds.
Value can also be extracted from engines and effective management of maintenance, says Sirius.

The proposed initial public offering will involve an initial placing and offer of ordinary shares, and will also feature a 
12-month placing programme for up to 300 million additional shares.
Sirius Aircraft Leasing Fund will use its investment advisor’s contacts to access an “attractive pipeline” of aircraft, 
and will aim for a dividend yield of 8% per year.
Millar, who also served as chief financial officer of Ryanair, says the investment advisor’s management team has 
“outstanding” capabilities and contacts.
“We are currently assessing a number of attractive portfolios and anticipate that the funds raised will be deployed 
within six months of admission,” he adds. The company expects to publish its prospectus later this month with 
admission taking place in early November.
Sirius Aviation Capital Holdings' senior managers include former Stellwagen Group figures Edward Coughlan, 
Kieran Ryan and Edward Hansom.

The collapse of Primera Air has once again shone a spotlight on the viability of the long-haul low-cost airline model.
While most commentators agree that long-haul low-cost operators have had a disruptive influence in their 
respective markets, doubt creeps in when discussion turns to the model's economic viability.
Our analysis of some of the key players indicates that those doubts are well founded. Few if any airlines have made 
true long-haul low-cost work in a sustainable manner, despite some achieving sporadic profitability.
FlightGlobal schedules data for October 2018 shows that the market's major participants operate mixed networks. 
In other words, no significant players have bet the house on becoming dedicated low-cost long-haul operators.
Several trends emerge from our analysis: long-haul point-to-point services frequently fail to attract enough demand, 
hampered by the lack of connecting passengers, while having no true business-class products and passengers can 
fatally stymie revenue opportunities.
When new players do gain some traction, powerful network carriers have been quick with defensive moves.
These and other factors are causing some carriers to rethink their strategies entirely, often leading to the adoption 
of products more commonly associated with traditional network carriers.
The network carriers themselves are also embracing long-haul low-cost – but it is doubtful whether those units can 
be considered true budget airlines.
However, the sector remains in its infancy. Many of the markets developed under the long-haul low-cost banner 
may prove sustainable; but the operating model seems likely to be "lower cost", rather than true low-cost.
Ironically for a market so suited to pioneers, the odds seem stacked against entrepreneurial start-ups.
E ANALYSIS: How the world's long-haul low-cost airlines are faring The collapse of Primera Air has once again 
shone a spotlight on the viability of the long-hau....
"Sadly, low-cost long-haul is the graveyard of ambition for start-ups," Ryanair chief operating officer Peter Bellew 
opined on Twitter after news broke of Primera Air's demise. "[It] seems almost impossible without business class or 
the deep pockets of a legacy carrier."
As fuel prices rise, the market is only likely to become more unforgiving.

Norwegian continues to be the industry's go-to disruptor, although it arguably still has much to prove in long-haul 
markets.
Loss-making during periods when rivals were making hay amid low oil prices, it surprised some by swinging to an 
operating profit for the second quarter of 2018. That came as IAG appeared to cool its fervour to acquire the 
Scandinavian operator.
The second quarter of this year represented the "peak" of Norwegian's growth, said the carrier, with capacity in 
ASKs up 48% year on year. That was partly driven by a doubling of the widebody fleet over the previous 12 months.
Norwegian's multiple new long-haul point-to-point services – many flown with Boeing 737 Max 8 narrowbodies – 
have brought mixed results. A number have closed within months of launch, most recently its transatlantic routes 
from Edinburgh.
The airline has also announced the cessation of its London Gatwick-Singapore service – the latest failure within a 
Europe-Asia market that appears hostile to low-cost operations.
"Norwegian's long-haul growth is substantially diluting the company's operating performance, and further stretching 
an already-stretched cash flow and balance sheet," argued analysts Bernstein in a July report.
In the next few months, Norwegian's stakeholders will be keeping a close eye on the impact of rising fuel costs on 
its long-haul operations and on defensive moves from network carriers.
EUROWINGS

Lufthansa described the first half of this year as "very busy and stressful" for Eurowings, as its second-quarter 
operating profit fell 91% to 5 million ($5.8 million).
The drop in performance was attributed to "increasing service irregularities" in the form of flight delays and 
cancellations, which necessitated "significant modifications" to Eurowings' summer schedule.
In terms of recent long-haul developments, Eurowings announced in December its plan start thrice-weekly La 
Vegas flights from Dusseldorf on 3 July 2019, using Airbus A330 and A340 jets.
Dusseldorf has become the carrier's largest long-haul base for the winter season. The carrier has based eight 
aircraft there and announced new services to Thailand and Cuba, alongside several existing US routes.
Munich is considered Eurowings' "second location" for intercontinental services, it said earlier this year. Lufthansa, 
however, will grow mainline operations rapidly at Munich next summer, including starting daily Bangkok services – a 
route that Eurowings has operated this summer.
E ANALYSIS: How the world's long-haul low-cost airlines are faring The collapse of Primera Air has once again 
shone a spotlight on the viability of the long-hau....
Much of Eurowings' recent growth has come from taking on Air Berlin, Brussels Airlines and LGW assets, while 
some of its flights are operated by leisure airline SunExpress.
Eurowings is widely seen as having a defensive function to offset the rise of true budget operators in the region. Its 
strong ties to its parent make it more of a "hybrid" airline than a low-cost operator – a point proven by its absorption 
of some Brussels Airlines assets – meaning it has limited value as a bellwether for the business model.
AIR CANADA ROUGE

Air Canada's budget arm has been a key part of strong group performance in recent years.
It is therefore better versed than many in the challenges of the low-cost long-haul model.
Speaking at Farnborough air show in July, Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinescu said that while low-cost 
carriers had a competitive edge in short-haul markets, there was an "equalising" effect in long-haul markets, where 
fuel is such a large proportion of cost that legacy carriers' extra burdens in other areas – such as pension liabilities 
– are less pronounced.
Nevertheless, "we are not ready to throw in the towel to the likes of Norwegian yet", he added, weeks after the 
Scandinavian carrier had announced plans to move into the Canadian market.
Air Canada Rouge was launched in 2012 with a focus on serving leisure routes with high-density, older aircraft 
handed down from its parent. It currently operates to destinations in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South 
America, Europe, and the USA.
Cheaper crew contracts have helped the unit to flourish, but as with many such subsidiaries of mainline carriers, it 
is debatable whether Rouge can be considered a true low-cost operator.

The Canadian operator announced its first quarterly loss in 13 years for the three months ended 30 June 2018.
That came a few months after it waved goodbye to chief executive Gregg Saretsky, with Ed Sims taking the reins 
amid a transformative period for the carrier.
Key to its long-haul strategy are incoming Boeing 787-9s, which will feature lie-flat and premium economy seats. 
They will be deployed on routes to Europe and possibly Asia. WestJet is also building business-class lounges.
Those moves suggest that it is unlikely to be considered a true low-cost long-haul operator for long.
"When WestJet launched back in 1996, it was very much a point-to-point carrier," wrote Sims in the carrier's in-flight 
magazine earlier this year. "Today, WestJet is evolving into what is known as a hub-and-spoke airline."

E ANALYSIS: How the world's long-haul low-cost airlines are faring The collapse of Primera Air has once again

The Singapore Airlines low-cost unit saw its operating profit fall from S$3 million ($2.2 million) to S$1 million in the 
second quarter of 2018.
Scoot's longest route, a Singapore-Berlin service, was launched in June this year, while it also flies long-haul 
services to Athens, Honolulu and destinations in Australia.
Much of the budget carrier's focus in recent years has been on the integration of fellow SIA carrier Tigerair, which 
added a number of Airbus narrowbodies to Scoot's fleet.
Speaking to FlightGlobal in the middle of last year, Scoot chief executive Lee Lik Hsin said the carrier was focusing 
on improving feed between the group's narrowbody and widebody operations.
Beyond its own operations, Scoot's strategy is very closely tied to that of its parent.
In June, SIA senior vice-president of corporate planning Lee Wen Fen said of the group's network strategy: "It's 
really looking at various markets and saying, does this market warrant an LCC, or full service, or is the market big 
enough for both... and then working out amongst ourselves, co-ordinating within the group on who should fly where 
and how do we manage overlaps."

AirAsia X Group co-chief executive Tony Fernandes recently told FlightGlobal that true long-haul low-cost services 
were not on the carrier's radar.
"We are pioneers in the long-haul low-cost market, but the reality of the model is medium-haul routes of six to eight 
hours – that is the sweet spot," he said.
Fernandes also noted that AirAsia X's strategy was focused on "high frequency, country dominance" routes that 
have connection options with sister carrier AirAsia.
He doubts the viability of most long-haul point-to-point markets, arguing that network carriers have much of the 
market sown up through their hubs.
That all but rules out any European routes for AirAsia X.
Earlier this year, however, Fernandes reiterated the operator's plans to start flights to the west coast of the USA via 
Japan after it receives its first Airbus A330neos in late 2019.
AirAsia X reported a deeper operating loss of MYR96 million ($23.3 million) for the second quarter of this year, 
compared with MYR12.8 million in the same period of 2017.
The carrier attributed the poorer results to a "higher operating cost" environment.

Jetstar Group achieved a record earnings result for the year ending 30 June, although domestic operations appear 
to be central to this.
E ANALYSIS: How the world's long-haul low-cost airlines are faring The collapse of Primera Air has once again 
shone a spotlight on the viability of the long-hau....
The Qantas unit was established in 2003 in a defensive move as Virgin eyed Australian services. Long-haul routes 
launched in 2006, meaning its markets are much more mature than equivalents in other regions.
Jetstar appears relatively relaxed, therefore, on its long-haul ambitions.
It currently serves markets in China, Hawaii, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam using Boeing 787-8 widebodies.
Change is most likely when it receives Airbus A321neos, which are due to enter its fleet from 2020.
In announcing the delivery of the jets, Qantas said they could fly up Australia's east coast up to Denpasar, 
potentially allowing some of Jetstar's 11 787-8s to be deployed in other markets.
However, Jetstar Group chief executive Gareth Evans told FlightGlobal earlier this year that the main focus for the 
A321neos would be on the domestic network, where they are central to a replacement programme for its fleet of 52 
baseline A320s and eight A321s.
Meanwhile, in June, Evans all but ruled out Jetstar services to Europe, stating: "Those sorts of distances are pretty 
new for low-cost European carriers, but here to Europe is a different proposition altogether. It's multi-sector, so 
you're going to have to stop off on the way, and that adds cost and complexity, and our business model is all about 
simplicity."
Aside from its main operation, Jetstar's various units are focused on short-haul markets.
Thanks to its status as a Qantas unit, Jetstar has limited use as a health indicator for the long-haul low-cost 
business model.
WOW AIR

(6,943km)
Wow Air's recent financial performance was outlined in an August 2018 investor presentation related to its first bond 
issue.
The presentation shows that the Icelandic carrier swung to an operating loss of $14 million in 2017, having made a 
$30 million profit the previous year. Wow expects the loss to deepen to $28 million in 2018, before a return to profit 
in 2019.
"Yields decreased in 2017, as airfares adjusted to previous drops in fuel prices and increased competition," the 
document states. "Growing pains include higher hiring and training costs; infrastructure investments; delivery costs 
associated with new aircraft; and start-up costs for new routes."
Early in 2017, Wow added "Comfy" and "Premium" booking options, the latter featuring a larger seat, as the carrier 
embraced the trend of seeking revenue growth away from the traditional, no-frills low-cost offering.
"As of Q2 2018, Comfy and Premium seats deliver 1.9x and 2.9x higher yields, respectively, compared to basic 
economy fares," the document notes.
It also states that from 2019, Wow's growth rate will be "adjusted to more sustainable levels". Just two aircraft are 
set to join its fleet next year.
Wow will meanwhile launch its first Asia service in December, operating from Reykjavik to Delhi, and is set to put its 
first A330neo into service around the same time.
E ANALYSIS: How the world's long-haul low-cost airlines are faring The collapse of Primera Air has once again

Chief executive Skuli Mogensen recently confirmed that the carrier was also planning an IPO within the next 18-24 
months.
Iceland's location means that Wow is able to offer transatlantic connections with relatively short flights, compared 
with European rivals.

Indonesia's Lion Air Group flies a number of sectors that only just register on the long-haul barometer.
In a more significant development regarding long-haul low-cost, however, Lion emerged as a customer for the re-
engined Airbus A330neo in August.
Eight of the aircraft will be delivered from 2019 via lessor BOC Aviation.
The A330neo will allow the company to expand its network and consider longer routes, according to Lion Air Group 
chief executive Edward Sirait.
Lion has previously ordered six A330-300s, three of which are operated through its partner carrier Thai Lion Air. 
They are currently deployed on short- and medium-haul routes.
Lion Air Group is a private company, so does not release financial results.

Launched by IAG in 2017 as a long-haul low-cost operation based in Barcelona – seemingly as a defensive 
response to Norwegian's expansion from the city – Level has since added a Paris base and broadened its horizons 
to include short-haul services from Vienna.
It is too early to assess the success or otherwise of this venture by the British Airways and Iberia parent, however.
During a half-year briefing, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said there was "still a lot of noise" regarding Level 
traffic statistics – which are "embedded" in Iberia's – and that IAG wants to "clean it up" before disclosing its figures.
Indeed, the airline has only just welcomed its first dedicated chief executive – in July it announced that Flybe chief 
strategy officer Vincent Hodder had been appointed to the role.
Hodder has taken over an airline with plenty of potential, not least thanks to the feed provided by IAG's pan-
European network.

In terms of long-haul growth plans, it was most recently seen requesting rights to fly to Seattle from Xian, beginning 
December this year.
It also began service from Beijing to the Maldives in July, as well as a Hangzhou-Moscow route.
Details on its financial performance are few and far between.
Earlier this year, Hainan Airlines denied claims it was planning to sell a majority stake in Capital Airlines to Air 
China.

The Brazilian budget carrier's long-haul services are closely tied to its partnership with TAP Air Portugal, hence its 
daily Sao Paulo-Lisbon service.
Aside from a few US services, Azul's network is dominated by domestic Brazilian flights, and its international 
ambitions appear to be small.

Air France-KLM has been careful to talk up Joon as a millennial-focused hybrid operation, rather than a low-cost 
one. While it therefore offers little encouragement to true long-haul low-cost operators, it perhaps hints at where the 
market might be heading.
Some of its strategy is budget-like, such as new contract terms for cabin crew. But elsewhere, the product is closer 
to a full-service offering, with three-class cabins and complimentary food on its long-haul flights.
Recent route developments include the announcement that Joon will operate Paris-Quito services during the 
summer of 2019.
At the carrier's launch last year, Joon chief executive Jean-Michel Mathieu said the subsidiary was a response to 
competition, specifically to address concerns that Air France was losing ground at its Paris Charles de Gaulle hub.
It remains to seen what importance new Air France-KLM chief Ben Smith places on Joon in the group's future 
strategy.

The Philippine low-cost carrier has significantly reduced its long-haul presence in recent years.
In the middle of last year, for example, it cut routes to Doha, Riyadh and Kuwait.
Just before those cancellations, Cebu chief executive Lance Gokongwei told FlightGlobal that Middle East 
competition had become "quite a bloodbath" as Gulf carriers and Philippine Airlines competed for its customers.

shone a spotlight on the viability of the long-hau....
Towards the end of 2017, Cebu said it needed to "rethink" its long-haul strategy and focus on meeting existing 
demand for regional and domestic flights.
Earlier this year it suggested that "our international growth strategy going forward is to connect secondary 
Philippine cities to international destinations", but few hard details have been forthcoming.
The carrier has previously cited the large concentration of Filipino workers overseas as potentially creating long-
haul point-to-point markets.
But rising fuel prices and a weaker second-quarter performance are unlikely to prompt any significant long-haul 
moves.

Warning on EU flight emissions plan; Airlines ; Campaign group says rules would be 'financial windfall' for

The EU will miss its 2030 aviation emissions target by almost 100m tonnes if it adopts a new industry-backed 
standard being rolled out next year, a transport campaign group has claimed.
The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation would allow airlines to offset emissions 
growth rather than necessarily reduce it, according to a report for Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based group 
for non-governmental organisations.
T&E said Corsia had "substantial and ongoing failings" and offered only "cheap and ineffective" remedies for 
emissions that contribute towards climate change.
It also said Corsia would represent a "financial windfall for airlines", saving them more than (EURO)3bn a year 
compared with expanding an existing scheme.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, the UN agency that developed Corsia, said the scheme was one part 
of "ICAO's basket of measures designed to reduce carbon emissions from international aviation" and that 
improvements in aircraft technology, operations and sustainable aviation fuels would "achieve the international 
aviation sector's global goal of carbonneutral growth from 2020".
Warning on EU flight emissions plan; Airlines ; Campaign group says rules would be 'financial windfall' for

The aviation industry supports Corsia. In December 2017, Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner 
IAG, called Corsia "an excellent first step", while low-cost carrier Ryanair has said it is a "historic breakthrough in 
global carbon emission regulation". Paul Steele, senior vice-president at the International Air Transport Association, 
which represents almost 300 airlines, said: "The agreement of Corsia by ICAO states was hugely significant as it 
offers the most effective and efficient means of offsetting the emissions that cannot be cut through technological 
and operational improvements in the short term."
From 2019, Corsia will require airlines to monitor, report and verify CO2 emissions to establish a baseline, before a 
pilot phase from 2021-23 for volunteer states. From 2027, most of ICAO's 191 member states will have to 
participate. The EU has an overarching target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 by 
2030, which has been set to 111m tonnes for emissions from flights leaving the bloc.
But the report found Corsia would not stop them rising to 211m tonnes, based on current sector growth predictions. 
Airlines could offset the balance through investing in emissions-reducing projects such as forest planting, solar 
energy or hydrodynamic power.
At the moment, the EU operates an emissions trading system for flights between and within member states that has 
a declining cap for aviation emissions. Corsia would replace this.

EU's no-deal contingency plans rattle London with threat of grounded flights

Brussels is planning to rattle the UK by revealing tough contingency measures for a no-deal Brexit that could force 
flight cancellations and leave exporters facing massive disruption if Britain departs the EU without an exit deal.
The European Commission is expected to reveal the plans next week in what will be its most detailed guidance to 
date on emergency measures it is weighing to mitigate some of the worst effects of Britain crashing out of the EU in 
March.
Against expectations in London, the plan is likely to encompass a limited number of initiatives over a maximum of 
eight months, according to diplomats who have seen the document.
Notably, the EU is not planning special arrangements for customs, road transport and only limited provisions for 
financial services - a decision that, if enacted, would cause long queues and operational snags at ports and 
airports.
The minimalist emergency plan, designed to be rolled out should there be no breakthrough in Brexit talks, would 
increase pressure on already fraught talks between the UK and the EU ahead of an October 17 summit. EU plans 
would then be firmed up by December.
However, the timing of the document indicates Brussels may use it as leverage in the talks, only to end up revising 
the no-deal plans. An EU diplomat familiar with the preparations said the commission was planning to adjust the 
EU's no-deal contingency plans rattle London with threat of grounded flights
tone of the draft according to progress made in negotiations over coming days. "It will be harder if it all gets stuck 
and softer if things are going well," the diplomat said.
According to the commission's draft, airlines such as Ryanair and International Airlines Group, British Airways' 
parent, would not be given any extra transition time to meet the bloc's regulatory requirement of 50 per cent EU 
ownership for a European operating licence. The commission urges groups to take "all necessary steps" to meet 
ownership requirements - implying forced buyouts of UK shareholders may be necessary to prevent limitations on 
where and when they could fly within the EU.
Brussels has resisted detailing its nodeal plans for fear it would disrupt talks. But with just six months before Brexit, 
EU states have pressed Brussels to speed up its preparations in case no deal is agreed in time. The EU would 
apply the measures until the end of 2019 on a unilateral basis. They could be revoked with no notice, say 
diplomats. Brussels torn page 4

According to the draft, airlines such as Ryanair and International Airline Group would not be given any extra 
transition time to meet the bloc's regulatory requirement of 50 per cent EU ownership to continue to operate.
The commission has resisted outlining details for fear it would disrupt negotiations. But with just six months to go 
before Brexit and without a deal in sight, member states have pressed Brussels to speed up its preparations in case 
of a nodeal scenario.
Brussels will outline general principles for deciding the fields requiring special measures, which must only mitigate 
significant disruptions in areas of "vital union interest".
The measures would be applied until the end of 2019 on a unilateral basis. They could be revoked with no notice, 
according to diplomats.
The plans are intended to enable basic air services, allowing flights to land and fly straight back to the UK, and to 
extend air safety certificates and security exemptions for UK travellers in transit. Visa free travel is envisaged for 
British citizens, as long as it is reciprocated.
In the draft, the commission argues that many of the no-deal risks in the financial sector have "diminished 
significantly" thanks to preparatory steps taken by the private institutions. It insists there would be "no generalised 
problem" with the enforceability of contracts - an issue raised by the UK as a potential threat to financial stability.
However, cleared derivative contracts are identified as an area entailing "potential risks to financial stability in a no-
deal scenario". The commission said it was still assessing what steps would need to be taken.
The EU also makes the case that it is unnecessary to relax customs and agrifood controls. Instead, it urges 
member states to be ready to enforce the EU's full rule book from the first day of Brexit.
Road hauliers would have their access rights limited to a system of permits that covers only 5 per cent of the 
existing traffic. There would be no mechanism to extend EU licences, according to a diplomat who had seen the 
document.
The commission also urges member states to have faith in Brussels' "collective plan" for a no-deal Brexit and 
refrain from striking bilateral agreements with the UK that would threaten the single market, even if they have the 
power to do so.
In case an agreement is reached with Britain, "the UK becomes a rule-taker not a rulemaker", the draft states 
bluntly, according to one of the diplomats.

S kyWork, Air Berlin, Monarch Airlines, VLM. And then, this week, Primera Air. All these European airlines have 
gone bust in a little over a year. They join better-known names in aviation's graveyard: Pan American, TWA, 
Sabena, Olympic Airways.
Ryanair is very much alive, but it cut its full-year profit guidance this week, blaming employee strikes and the high 
oil price.
Robert Crandall, head of American Airlines in the 1980s and 1990s, said that anyone who invested in airlines was 
"nuts". Warren Buffett quipped that there was a helpline he called whenever he thought of buying airline shares.
Yet many are still tempted to enter the business. A group of industry veterans announced last month that they 
wanted to raise more than $100m in Switzerland to launch a low-cost carrier to fly from Basel to North America.
"Maybe it's sex appeal, but there's something about an airline that drives investors crazy," Alfred Kahn, who 
deregulated US airlines in the 1970s, once said.
Even Mr Buffett has since invested in several US airlines. "They had a bad first century," he told CNBC. "Everyone 
has a bad century now and then."
But in this century, the aviation dilemma remains the same. Airlines have high fixed costs, an enduring vulnerability 
to the oil price and constant price competition from their rivals.
Ryanair picks a foolish battle with its pilots
So what is the key to airline survival? Being mean, and knowing whom to be mean to. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's 
boss, discovered years ago that you could insult and mistreat your customers all you wanted; offer them cheap 
tickets and they would still fly.
He said of passengers wanting to cancel because their grandmother was ill: "What part of no refund don't they 
understand?" Mr O'Leary claimed to have had a change of heart in 2013 after two profit warnings, saying he would 
make Ryanair passenger-friendly. "I want my customers to love me the way I love them." But a customer-loving Mr 
O'Leary was as believable as a bashful Boris Johnson. Ryanair's past success depended on shaving costs and 
getting customers to pay for extras. In August, it told passengers they could take only a small bag on board unless 
they paid (EURO)6 extra for priority boarding.
Extra charges, along with squeezed economy seats, are no longer a Ryanair preserve. Older airlines across the US 
and Europe have done the same. British Airways now charges for food on its economy short-haul flights.
But passengers are one thing; pilots are another. It is best to stay on the right side of them. Unfortunately for Mr 
O'Leary, Ryanair messed up its pilot rostering last year, leading to more than 20,000 flights being cancelled.
Ryanair pilots saw their chance and demanded union recognition. This was something Mr O'Leary had flatly refused 
for years. (Hell would freeze over and he would cut his arms off were two of his characteristically understated 
assessments of the prospect.) Much of the airline's success had come from avoiding the costs that union demands 
had added to traditional carriers over the years. But faced with the threat of pilot strikes, Ryanair began recognising 
air crew unions, starting with Balpa, the UK pilots' representatives. The strikes happened all the same. Over the 
summer, Ryanair pilots and cabin crew went on strike in Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy and Germany.
And once strikes start, passengers worry that they will happen again. Mr O'Leary said customer confidence had 
taken a knock. People do not want to book their holidays if they fear they may not happen. As Ryanair has 
discovered, even meanness to passengers has its limits.

In 1995, soon after taking over as chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary wrote a characteristically plain-
speaking memo.
His mission to control costs would be "ruthless ... at the expense of charm, style and elegance if necessary".
Mr O'Leary has been true to his word.
Ryanair's hard-nosed culture has produced an airline with few frills but market-leading profitability and a superior 
valuation.
But the low-cost carrier, which issued a profit warning this week and saw its shares drop 11 per cent in response, is 
suffering its harshest period, beset by strikes, high fuel prices and fiercer competition.
Investors and industry figures are even asking whether Ryanair's best days are behind it.
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said last year's net income of (EURO)1.45bn "is an earning level they will 
not be reaching any time ever again soon". This week's warning brought the 2019 profit target down more than 10 
per cent to (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn.
O'Leary risks losing the cost-killing touch Profit warning and sharply falling stock take toll on Ryanair as restive 
unions tarnish golden image with investors
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr O'Leary warned that there might be further bad news.
"Do we have to trim guidance again for the year? We hope we don't have to, but again, it can't be ruled out if [ticket] 
pricing continues to fall and oil prices continue to rise."
He was sanguine, though, about the company's stock.
"Our share price has been grim, but the performance of most of our peers has been equally grim."
It is true that most airlines have suffered this year, but Ryanair, whose shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent, 
has previously outshone the market. On a five-year basis, IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, has caught up 
with its low-cost rival, having spent most of that period trailing by a large margin.
While the industry has been hit by a surging oil price and overcapacity, Ryanair has endured a painful series of 
strikes that have left passengers exasperated and investors worried that Mr O'Leary is losing his ability to control 
costs.
"The employment practices of Ryanair were unique and, as it appears now, not sustainable," said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC. "Their unit costs will still be very good, and almost certainly among the best in the 
industry, but the gap will narrow."
Mr O'Leary has repeatedly expressed his dislike of unions, once saying "hell would freeze over" before he 
recognised them, but he told the FT that he had long expected the evolution.
"I have two stances: we will ultimately be unionised ... and I have accepted that as reality. But for as long as we can 
postpone unionisation, we would try to postpone unionisation. The two aren't contradictory."
After a rostering debacle last autumn, which led to thousands of cancelled flights and millions in compensation 
payments, Ryanair agreed to recognise its unions and negotiate collective labour agreements.
However, the process has been rough, with few CLAs secured so far and staff striking many times over the 
summer, sometimes in concert across Europe.
Strikes are not uncommon in aviation. British Airways cabin crew staged 85 days of industrial action across 2016-
17. But Ryanair's are particularly damaging, as the airline is unable or unwilling to take expensive mitigation 
measures such as hiring replacement aircraft with external crews.
Joost van Doesburg, of Dutch pilots' union VNV, said he wanted to warn customers about the true cost of cheap 
flights.
"If you are paying a not realistic amount of money for your tickets, someone else is getting the bill - in this case, the 
employees."
Even as he deals with restive pilots, Mr O'Leary is out shopping for more. The failures of several small European 
airlines helps the industry's overcapacity and provides hiring amid a pilot shortage.
"It isn't going to be pretty this winter, and there will be lots of opportunities," said Mr O'Leary.
On Monday night Primera, a small Latvian-based carrier, failed, and on Wednesday Ryanair "had an open day for 
Primera pilots ... We interviewed over 100 pilots", Mr O'Leary said.
Ryanair's strength, even if it did accept unions, would be its discipline, said aviation consultant Philipp Goedeking, 
who has advised 20 airlines on improving their competitiveness and works with banks on the strategic risks airlines 
pose for investors.
O'Leary risks losing the cost-killing touch Profit warning and sharply falling stock take toll on Ryanair as restive 
unions tarnish golden image with investors
He praised Ryanair for strictly following its "outrageously successful" strategy with "not an iota of deviation from that 
course", for example moving into long-haul flights. When it came to unionisation, Mr Goedeking said: "He will lose 
that battle ... but it will not kill Ryanair".
Whether Ryanair can change under Mr O'Leary, 57, in part depends on whether he stays at the top: in 2019, his 
five-year contract comes to an end and he has said he would prefer a rolling annual contract, while the board wants 
another five-year one.
Unions said there was no chance of cultural change while he was still in charge, and analysts said they had seen 
no evidence of such change so far.
And despite the share price fall, some large shareholders are sticking with Mr O'Leary.
One top-30 shareholder said that although the strikes were a "significant setback" to trust and image, "the 
company's union representatives must understand the company's business model, as it is in no party's interest to 
kill the golden goose."

22-year tenure sparks protest High up Ryanair's list of problems is investor unhappiness with chairman David 
Bonderman, the 75-year-old who is also the billionaire founder of Texas Pacific Group, the US private equity firm.
Almost 30 per cent of shares were voted against his re-election at the airline's recent annual meeting, as investors 
protested that Mr Bonderman's 22-year tenure meant he could not be an independent check on chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
The vote contradicted the forecast of Mr O'Leary, who at a press conference in September had expected a 
maximum rebellion of 20 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said he hoped Mr Bonderman would be re-elected in 2019, but said: "There is a succession plan in 
place, and that will be revealed in the next year or two ... There's no fixed date, there's no fixed names."
Two senior figures with knowledge of Ryanair's internal affairs said Ryanair was preparing for the "inevitability" of 
"Bondo", as the chairman is known in the boardroom, standing down.
One of those figures said: "It wouldn't have been lost on Bonderman or anybody that the vote went that way ... We'd 
prefer that it was managed, rather than he was pushed."
Both said the airline had yet to initiate a formal succession process.
Whoever replaces the private equity boss, it will not be Mr O'Leary, who has claimed he has "no desire" to do it. "I'm 
not old enough, calm enough or wise enough to be chairman of Ryanair."

In 1995, soon after taking over as chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary wrote a characteristically plain-
speaking memo.
His mission to control costs would be "ruthless ... at the expense of charm, style and elegance if necessary".
Mr O'Leary has been true to his word.
Ryanair's hard-nosed culture has produced an airline with few frills but market-leading profitability and a superior 
valuation.
But the low-cost carrier, which issued a profit warning this week and saw its shares drop 11 per cent in response, is 
suffering its harshest period, beset by strikes, high fuel prices and fiercer competition.
Investors and industry figures are even asking whether Ryanair's best days are behind it.
Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, said last year's net income of (EURO)1.45bn "is an earning level they will 
not be reaching any time ever again soon". This week's warning brought the 2019 profit target down more than 10 
per cent to (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn.
O'Leary risks losing the cost-killing touch; Profit warning and sharply falling stock take toll on Ryanair as restive 
unions tarnish golden image with investors
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr O'Leary warned that there might be further bad news.
"Do we have to trim guidance again for the year? We hope we don't have to, but again, it can't be ruled out if [ticket] 
pricing continues to fall and oil prices continue to rise."
He was sanguine, though, about the company's stock.
"Our share price has been grim, but the performance of most of our peers has been equally grim."
It is true that most airlines have suffered this year, but Ryanair, whose shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent, 
has previously outshone the market. On a five-year basis, IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, has caught up 
with its low-cost rival, having spent most of that period trailing by a large margin.
While the industry has been hit by a surging oil price and overcapacity, Ryanair has endured a painful series of 
strikes that have left passengers exasperated and investors worried that Mr O'Leary is losing his ability to control 
costs.
"The employment practices of Ryanair were unique and, as it appears now, not sustainable," said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC. "Their unit costs will still be very good, and almost certainly among the best in the 
industry, but the gap will narrow."
Mr O'Leary has repeatedly expressed his dislike of unions, once saying "hell would freeze over" before he 
recognised them, but he told the FT that he had long expected the evolution.
"I have two stances: we will ultimately be unionised ... and I have accepted that as reality. But for as long as we can 
postpone unionisation, we would try to postpone unionisation. The two aren't contradictory."
After a rostering debacle last autumn, which led to thousands of cancelled flights and millions in compensation 
payments, Ryanair agreed to recognise its unions and negotiate collective labour agreements.
However, the process has been rough, with few CLAs secured so far and staff striking many times over the 
summer, sometimes in concert across Europe.
Strikes are not uncommon in aviation. British Airways cabin crew staged 85 days of industrial action across 2016-
17. But Ryanair's are particularly damaging, as the airline is unable or unwilling to take expensive mitigation 
measures such as hiring replacement aircraft with external crews.
Joost van Doesburg, of Dutch pilots' union VNV, said he wanted to warn customers about the true cost of cheap 
flights.
"If you are paying a not realistic amount of money for your tickets, someone else is getting the bill - in this case, the 
employees."
Even as he deals with restive pilots, Mr O'Leary is out shopping for more. The failures of several small European 
airlines helps the industry's overcapacity and provides hiring amid a pilot shortage.
"It isn't going to be pretty this winter, and there will be lots of opportunities," said Mr O'Leary.
On Monday night Primera, a small Latvian-based carrier, failed, and on Wednesday Ryanair "had an open day for 
Primera pilots ... We interviewed over 100 pilots", Mr O'Leary said.
Ryanair's strength, even if it did accept unions, would be its discipline, said aviation consultant Philipp Goedeking, 
who has advised 20 airlines on improving their competitiveness and works with banks on the strategic risks airlines 
pose for investors.
O'Leary risks losing the cost-killing touch; Profit warning and sharply falling stock take toll on Ryanair as restive 
unions tarnish golden image with investors
He praised Ryanair for strictly following its "outrageously successful" strategy with "not an iota of deviation from that 
course", for example moving into long-haul flights. When it came to unionisation, Mr Goedeking said: "He will lose 
that battle ... but it will not kill Ryanair".
Whether Ryanair can change under Mr O'Leary, 57, in part depends on whether he stays at the top: in 2019, his 
five-year contract comes to an end and he has said he would prefer a rolling annual contract, while the board wants 
another five-year one.
Unions said there was no chance of cultural change while he was still in charge, and analysts said they had seen 
no evidence of such change so far.
And despite the share price fall, some large shareholders are sticking with Mr O'Leary.
One top-30 shareholder said that although the strikes were a "significant setback" to trust and image, "the 
company's union representatives must understand the company's business model, as it is in no party's interest to 
kill the golden goose."
Additional reporting by Attracta Mooney in London and Henny Sender in Hong Kong Bondo botheration Chairman's 
22-year tenure sparks protest High up Ryanair's list of problems is investor unhappiness with chairman David 
Bonderman, the 75-year-old who is also the billionaire founder of Texas Pacific Group, the US private equity firm.
Almost 30 per cent of shares were voted against his re-election at the airline's recent annual meeting, as investors 
protested that Mr Bonderman's 22-year tenure meant he could not be an independent check on chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
The vote contradicted the forecast of Mr O'Leary, who at a press conference in September had expected a 
maximum rebellion of 20 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said he hoped Mr Bonderman would be re-elected in 2019, but said: "There is a succession plan in 
place, and that will be revealed in the next year or two ... There's no fixed date, there's no fixed names."
Two senior figures with knowledge of Ryanair's internal affairs said Ryanair was preparing for the "inevitability" of 
"Bondo", as the chairman is known in the boardroom, standing down.
One of those figures said: "It wouldn't have been lost on Bonderman or anybody that the vote went that way ... We'd 
prefer that it was managed, rather than he was pushed."
Both said the airline had yet to initiate a formal succession process.
Whoever replaces the private equity boss, it will not be Mr O'Leary, who has claimed he has "no desire" to do it. "I'm 
not old enough, calm enough or wise enough to be chairman of Ryanair."

Ryanair 's special status is tarnished - it's now a question of fight or flight for O'Leary
Ryanair's special status is tarnished - it's now a question of fight or flight for

MICHAEL O'Leary is not short of ambition. The chief executive of Ryanair has spoken of flying 200m passengers in 
a year, and of profits of (EURO)2bn per annum, adding more than a third to the highest achieved in a year to date.
The target date is 2024, but questions are being asked if O'Leary will still be around to oversee it happen.
Next year will mark O'Leary's twenty-fifth anniversary as chief executive - remarkable longevity at any publicly 
quoted company, let alone in an industry noted for its cycles of boom and bust.
He said that when his latest five-year contract runs out next autumn, he wants to return to the old system of putting 
him on rolling twelve-month deals. That would make it much easier for him to walk away in the future, or for the 
airline to decline to renew his contract.
The latter is almost unthinkable. For all of the criticism O'Leary has received from disgruntled customers and the 
media, he is loved by investors for what he has delivered in recent decades, delivering superior returns compared 
to competitors. He reads the market better than almost anyone else, knowing when to reduce fares to keep his 
planes full, or when to buy aircraft at steeply discounted prices.
It is almost as hard to imagine that O'Leary would decide to walk away, so much has Ryanair become part of his 
DNA. But the last year has been tough for him. The mass cancellation of flights a year ago - because there weren't 
enough pilots to fly the planes - was an expensive embarrassment. But worse, it provided an opportunity for angry 
employees and contractors.
Ryanair 's special status is tarnished - it's now a question of fight or flight for O'Leary
Knowing that Ryanair could not afford further disruption to its schedule of flights, they threatened strikes. To avoid 
the damage this would have caused, O'Leary capitulated to their demands: the company would negotiate with 
formal trade unions instead of worker representative bodies.
This has changed everything for Ryanair and O'Leary. It has weakened his control and power. It may also have 
reduced the enjoyment he gets from the job. Don't underestimate the importance of that. Although his shares in 
Ryanair are an important part of his billionaire's portfolio, he has plenty of wealth elsewhere he can enjoy.
The last year has been marked by difficult negotiations in each country in which Ryanair bases its aircraft.
Britain, interestingly, has been one of the locations in which he has been able to strike deals relatively quickly with 
unions representing pilots and cabin crews. But longstanding conflict with the pilots in Ireland meant a deal there 
was achieved only after a number of strikes. Last Friday, the German pilots joined with cabin crew across a number 
of European countries - leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
More trouble is being threatened.
O'Leary, meanwhile, took himself to the European Commission last week to allege that the unions with whom he 
was dealing were being "infiltrated" by staff from rival airlines, who were using the opportunity to undermine 
Ryanair's cost advantages. Although he has done some serious bridge-building with the EU in recent years, he got 
little sympathy.
It isn't just the costs of all the deals that are having to be done - an estimated (EURO)100m extra bill each year for 
Ryanair - that infuriates O'Leary. It is the loss of the flexibility to open and close routes more quickly than rivals.
This is why the shares are trading down nearly a quarter on a year ago, when the airline's troubles began. The 
higher price of aircraft fuel is partly responsible too, but it is the realisation that Ryanair may no longer have the 
special status of being something different to other airlines that has dragged the share price down.
Fulfilling Ryanair's big ambitions has become much harder than it seemed a year ago. O'Leary has fought big fights 
before. The odds are that he will continue at Ryanair to do so, but the questions will remain.

BUDGET airline Ryanair said it hopes to settle its dispute with unions that have shadowed its summer schedule by 
Christmas.
Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs told reporters in Madrid the airline wanted to have agreements in place with 
crew and pilots by Christmas, with the view to implementing them next year. He said Ryanair has accepted 
demands from Spanish unions to hire local staff on Spanish contracts.
Pilots and cabin crew launched industrial action over the summer to try to persuade Ryanair to move its contracts 
from being based in Ireland to the country of origin for its employees.
On Monday the airline admitted that the strikes had affected consumer confidence as it downgraded its profit 
guidance for the year, in a move that sent shares diving more than 12 per cent at market close.
Passenger statistics released by Ryanair yesterday showed it carried 13.1m passengers in September, an 11 per 
cent increase on the same time last year.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) received a price-target reduction from Berenberg after the airline serving Ireland, the 
UK, Continental Europe, Morocco and Israel lowered its full-year earnings guidance Monday, citing lower traffic and 
fares due to recent strikes, as well as higher fuel costs. 
Berenberg's new price target on the company's Ireland-traded shares is EUR12.60, down from EUR13.50 but still 
above the recent trading level. The shares were down 2.1% at EUR11.24 in recent trading in Ireland. Berenberg 
kept its investment rating on the stock at hold. 
In a note to clients, Berenberg said the price-target reduction comes as the firm lowered its estimate for Ryanair's 
full-year earnings to account for the factors cited in the guidance cut. 
Berenberg noted Ryanair's guidance cut "appears company-specific." However, the firm warned, "we expect 
underlying capacity pressure to challenge short-haul industry yields into 2019." 
Ryanair's new guidance range for 2018 adjusted earnings is EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 billion, down from its 
previous guidance range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion. The guidance excludes the impact of Ryanair's 
August acquisition of 75% of Laudamotion. 
In cutting the guidance, Ryanair cited "lower traffic and weaker close-in fares in September, caused by two days of 
coordinated pilot/cabin crew strikes in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal," as well as "lower Q3 fares 
as forward bookings (particularly for the [October] school mid-terms and Christmas) and customer confidence are 
affected by fear of further strikes." The firm also cited higher EU261 care and re-accommodation costs arising from 
the recent strikes, as well as higher prices for its unhedged oil.

 Stocks in London are set to open lower on Tuesday amid political uncertainty in Europe and soft trading in Asia 
overnight.
In focus on Tuesday is the latest UK construction Purchasing Managers' Index reading for September, due at 0930 
BST, which is forecast to dip slightly from August.
In early company news, Ferguson reported a rise in annual revenue though profit dipped, while Royal Dutch Shell 
took a final investment decision on LNG Canada and airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air both saw passenger numbers 
grow in September.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 27.57 points lower at 7,468.10 on Tuesday. The 
FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 14.53 points, at 7,495.67 on Monday.
"European markets underwent a mixed start to the week and Q3 yesterday with fairly decent gains for the German 
DAX, however the FTSEMib remained under pressure as political rhetoric out of Italy with respect to the recent 
budget pointed to the prospect of a showdown with the EU, as well as concerns about possible downgrades in the 
coming weeks," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
He added: "This uncertainty along with weakness in Asia looks set to weigh on European markets this morning with 
a lower open expected."
Attention in the UK will lie on the construction Purchasing Managers' Index reading for September, seen slipping to 
52.5 from 52.9 last month. The construction data comes following Monday's manufacturing beat, which showed the 
sector's pace of expansion unexpectedly accelerated in September.
However, Societe Generale sees the index falling further than this.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Shell To Proceed With LNG Canada; UK PMI Due
"We see downward pressures on all three components of the construction PMI; housing, commercial and civil 
engineering. We expect the overall construction PMI to fall from 52.9 to 52.1," said analysts at Societe Generale.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3007 early Tuesday ahead of the construction PMI, lower compared to USD1.3040 at 
the London equities close on Monday.
In company news, plumbing and heating products supplier Ferguson said revenue rose in its recently-ended 
financial year, though profit dipped, with its order book indicating growth in the coming months.
Revenue for the year to July 31 rose 7.6% to USD20.75 billion, though pretax profit fell to USD1.19 billion from 
USD1.42 billion. Before exceptional items, pretax profit grew to USD1.27 billion from USD1.21 billion. 
Ongoing trading profit rose 15% to USD1.51 billion.
The US business saw ongoing revenue increase of 9.9% on an organic basis, with acquisitions contributing a 
further 1.4%. In the UK, like-for-like revenue was up 0.7% though organic revenue was 5.3% lower due to the 
closure of branches and the exit of low margin wholesale business.
The company proposed a final dividend of 131.9 cents, up from 73.33 cents a year ago. This brings the total payout 
for the year to 189.3 cents, up 21% year-on-year.
"In the first eight weeks of our new financial year organic revenue growth has been broadly in line with the overall 
growth rate last year, though growth in September was slightly lower than August. The growth in our order books 
suggests continued growth in the months ahead," said Chief Executive John Martin. 
Shell Canada Energy, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell, on Tuesday said it has taken a final investment decision on 
LNG Canada.
LNG Canada is a major liquified natural gas project in Kitimat, in which Shell has a 40% working interest. With LNG 
Canada&rsquo;s joint venture participants also having taken a final investment decision, construction is to start 
immediately, with first liquified natural gas expected "before the middle of the next decade".
Shell said its 40% share of the project's capital cost is within its capital investment guidance of USD25 billion to 
USD30 billion per year.
"LNG Canada is well positioned to help Shell meet the growing needs of customers at a time when we see an LNG 
supply shortage in our outlook. With significant integration advantages from the upstream through to trading, LNG 
Canada is expected to deliver Shell an integrated internal rate of return of some 13%, while the cash flow it 
generates is expected to be significant, long life and resilient," said Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden.
In other oil news on Tuesday, Brent oil hit its best level since late 2014 overnight of USD85.42 a barrel.
Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said a move in oil to USD100 per barrel could be on the 
cards.
"Concerns over tighter supply ahead of the Iran embargo are keeping the bulls firmly in control. Iran supplies almost 
3% of the world's daily oil consumption, so any sanctions on Iran will hit the supply side of the equation, and hard. 
Supply is looking fragile and when you then throw in Venezuela's declining output, the price looks well supported," 
said Lawler.
Back in company news, Ryanair and Wizz Air both reported a growth in passenger numbers for September.
Ryanair said total customers grew 11% in the month to 13.1 million, with load factor flat at 97%. This includes 
Lauda, which recorded 500,000 passengers in September. The month included two days of "unnecessary" strikes 
which resulted in over 400 flight cancellations, the budget airline highlighted.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Shell To Proceed With LNG Canada; UK PMI Due
Wizz Air meanwhile saw passengers grow 18% in September to 3.2 million, as load factor improved to 94.1% from 
92.9%.
Defence firm Meggitt said it has been awarded a five-year contract worth USD323 million with the US Defense 
Logistics Agency to supply wheels, brakes and related spare parts. The contract includes a further five-year option 
period and replaces a prior five year Indefinite Demand/Indefinite Quantity agreement, which expired on Sunday.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended mostly in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 
0.7%, the S&P 500 rising 0.4% but Nasdaq Composite closing 0.1% lower.
In Asia on Tuesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.1%. Markets in China are closed this week for the 
National Day Golden Week holiday, though the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong opened from Monday's holiday to 
trade 2.40% lower on Tuesday.
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has eurozone producer prices at 1000 BST.

Following years of airline industry debate about how pilot training should be delivered in the digital age, Europe’s 
aircrew training philosophy is about to be changed almost beyond recognition. The planned changes should be in 
the pipeline at airline training departments and approved training organisations (ATO) this year. The European 
Aviation Safety Agency has ruled that the new training theory and practice will become mandatory by 31 January 
2022 “at the latest”. Updated European Central Question Bank theory examination questions will be released by 
mid-2019.
The first of two strands to this new regime is a move away from syllabus- and hours-based instruction in ab initio 
flying training towards competency-based training and assessment. At the type-rating and recurrent level, the move 
will be towards evidence-based training.
Some major airlines have been gradually moving to evidence-based recurrent training over the past five years, and 
the rate of adoption is accelerating. As EASA describes it, the evidence-based project “is a global safety initiative 
designed to identify areas for improvement and allow the re-prioritisation of training topics”. It is a change in 
recurrent training philosophy rather than a new set of rules.
The second strand is a huge change in the teaching, learning and examining philosophy for the theoretical 
knowledge pilots are required to have – especially at the ab initio level. Student pilots will still need to learn air law, 
navigation, meteorology and all the traditional theory subjects. But under a new EASA scheme called Area 100 KSA 
(Knowledge, Skills and Attitude), they will need to demonstrate a greater depth of understanding and ability to act 
on the learned knowledge and skills, which the traditional system does not test.
Area 100 KSA is not a traditional subject, says EASA; rather, it is a change in training philosophy that allows the 
ATO to consolidate students’ understanding of the different theoretical knowledge subjects applied to practical 
Higher level learning Updated rules aim to fill sho r tage in expe r tise and build a supply of airline-ready pilo t s 
by making enhanced decision- making and p....
scenarios. KSA is an add-on to an existing pilot training course like the commercial pilot licence and instrument 
rating (CPL/IR) course, and adds an estimated 20h to the training task.
ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
Evidence of the need for additional knowledge and skills came, above all, from the experience of the airline 
recruitment and training departments at EasyJet and Ryanair. They were independently discovering that about 50% 
of fully licensed pilots applying to work for them, many with previous experience, would fail their simulator 
assessments, despite having been provided with the details well in advance, and having plenty of time to prepare.
Ryanair’s head of training is Capt Andy O’Shea, who also chairs the European Aircrew Training Policy Group 
(ATPG) that has been essential to EASA’s development of its new training philosophy. O’Shea worked out that the 
missing component in pilot performance among those who failed was, above all, a lack of in-depth understanding of 
facts and theory, including their significance and how to apply them in real-life scenarios.
In its notice of proposed amendment on the subject, EASA said: “Current teaching and learning tools are not 
sufficiently developed to encourage future pilots to use analytic and synthetic thinking or to challenge student pilots 
to enhance their decision-making skills, their problem-solving ability, and their level of understanding of assimilated 
knowledge.”
Working with the industry, EASA and the Royal Aeronautical Society through the ATPG, the group devised a 
solution. Ryanair applied such a solution voluntarily some time ago, and has now launched a mentored cadet 
training programme with the Cork-based ATO Atlantic Flight Training Academy, which will incorporate the KSA 
philosophy and new EASA standards.
It has long been accepted that CPL/IR licence holders, who are trained to competency in solo piloting skills on light 
piston-twins, need additional modules in a multi-crew co-operation and jet orientation course (MCC/JOC) to prepare 
them for airline flightdecks. Airline recruiting experience, however, has demonstrated that this was still not enough.
Graduates of the multi-crew pilot licence course theoretically should meet the new specification, because it has 
always been structured to produce airline-ready co-pilots. But some airlines are reluctant to commit to the 
approximately 18-month training partnership with an individual student pilot that the course entails. Thus, the 
flexibility conferred by the CPL/IR plus MCC/JOC is still attractive to many employers – but only if graduate quality 
can be improved.
The ATPG’s solution is a bolt-on to the traditional CPL/IR course, described as an enhanced MCC, but called the 
Airline Pilot Standard MCC course. It is effectively an updated MCC/JOC with knowledge consolidation and 
scenario training thrown in. Any CPL/IR graduate who passes this is awarded an Airline Pilot Certificate, which 
validates their airline readiness. The problem is, apparently, solved and EASA is happy – although the scheme will 
remain voluntary.
TRAINING UPGRADE
Ryanair’s new arrangement with the Atlantic Flight Training Academy will incorporate just such a training upgrade, 
creating ab initio licensed pilots ready to go straight into a Ryanair type-rating course and pass it. O’Shea says this 
is the first of many ATO partnerships it intends to set up across Europe to ensure it has a supply of airline-ready co-
pilots for the future.
Meanwhile, “attitude” – that newly specified component within EASA’s “KSA” definition – describes a desired 
approach by the student pilots towards their career as a professional aviator, and to the learning process itself. 
EASA says the “attitude” in KSA encompasses “leadership, determination, teamwork and communication”.
Traditionally, ab initio flying training has been considered a largely practical exercise in learning to operate a 
machine in an unfamiliar three-dimensional environment. If a student passed the flying and knowledge tests within 
Higher level learning Updated rules aim to fill sho r tage in expe r tise and build a supply of airline-ready pilo t s 
by making enhanced decision- making and p....
the prescribed number of hours, they were licensed. Now, the cognitive learning processes involved in mastering 
the aviation environment are being tested against learning theories more associated with academia.
EASA builds on a standard taxonomy of mental skills, which sees students progress from a base level of 
“remembering” or “knowing” to understanding, application, analysis, evaluation and, ultimately, creativity. If pilots 
reach the top level, they can confidently use their knowledge and skills to solve problems not encountered before, 
while continuing to operate their aircraft safely.
This approach, as EASA explains it, is intended to “develop and elicit a higher level of thinking in future pilots 
already during their ground training, and to challenge student pilots to enhance their decision-making skills, their 
problem-solving ability, their level of understanding of assimilated knowledge, and generally to facilitate the 
development of their core competencies”. One component students can expect is regular tests of mental arithmetic 
as applied to aircraft management, like fuel consumption against distance. This should improve the likelihood, for 
example, that they would recognise an erroneous flight management system output that stemmed from an 
unnoticed input error.
A trainee pilot who achieves the top level in aviation knowledge and skills should have achieved the elusive 
qualitative goal of “resilience”, an ability to integrate elements from different areas to solve problems – a 
characteristic that all airlines want to see in their crew.
During its early deliberations about the need to improve training outcomes, EASA stated: “[UK Civil Aviation 
Authority] analysis of fatal aircraft accidents worldwide for the period 2010–2011 shows that in more than 50% of 
these accidents the actions of the flight crew were the primary causal factor. This analysis shows that flightcrew 
handling skills were a factor in 14% of the accidents, whereas flightcrew non-technical skills were a factor in more 
than twice as many (32%)”.
But if the new training, learning and testing system works as intended, even the ab initio graduate should have a fair 
degree of resilience, and be able to renew and extend that through recurrent training, rather than relying on the 
experience of thousands of uneventful hours in the right-hand seat of a highly-automated airliner to – somehow – 
deliver it.
According to training industry guru Peter Moxham, co-chairman of the ATPG, the next issue that needs to be 
addressed is candidate selection. At present, it remains tempting for some ATO to take on students who are 
temperamentally unsuitable for a commercial piloting career, just because they keep on insisting they have always 
wanted to do it. Is it, however, the training industry’s job to keep on telling them they are wasting their money?

Ryanair pays the price of making take-off an optional extra
Ryanair pays the price of making take-off an optional extra

c ? Choose your seat - £4 ? Add extra legroom - £15 ? C? Carry on an extra cabin bag - £6 ? Fast track through 
security - £3.50 ? Have pilot fly plane - £12.50 ? Actually leave tarmac - £20 You wouldn't put it past Ryanair, would 
you? It seems to charge extra for every aspect of air travel previously deemed a prerequisite. But there is a reason 
the airline would never dare add those last two fees: it has seen what happens to bookings if you make taking off an 
optional extra.
Yesterday Ryanair warned of a, roughly, (EURO)150m cut to its full-year profit after tax, to a lower range of 
(EURO)1.10bn-(EURO)1.20bn, because "customer confidence" had been "affected by fear of further strikes". In 
recent weeks, walkouts by European pilots and cabin crew over pay and conditions meant 40,000 passengers had 
their flights grounded. And it seems passengers need to be confident of being taken where they want to go (or at 
least to an airport within 50 miles) before handing over their money. A Ryanair ticket may cost the same as a lottery 
ticket (before you add those extras) but purchasers apparently want more than a 1 in 40,000 chance of a return 
(even to London Stansted).
As one analyst put it, with a degree of understatement: "Clients like cheap airfares but they value flight certainty 
more." So, too, do City types. But, unlike stranded passengers in TV news vox pops, they did at least have some 
certainty that this profit warning was coming (and the Boeing 737-800 to Düsseldorf probably was not). As Morgan 
Stanley pointed out, consensus estimates for Ryanair's post-tax profit had already fallen some way below its 
previous guidance range of (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn. So why would its shares fall 12 per cent in response to 
a certainty? Arguably because Ryanair - despite reaching agreements with pilots and crew in Ireland, the UK and 
Ryanair pays the price of making take-off an optional extra
Italy - still cannot rule out further flight disruption elsewhere in Europe, "which may require full-year guidance to be 
lowered further".
But arguably also because, even when the disruption is finally over, Ryanair will not be able to go back to being the 
extremely low-cost airline it once was. Its profit warning included several other factors common to all airlines: staff 
costs, fuel prices, capacity and weaker fares.
Offering local contracts with improved terms and conditions to staff continues what one commentator called 
Ryanair's "painful transition into a higher-cost airline".
Paying a higher price of $82 a barrel for the 10 per cent of its oil bill that is not hedged puts it in the same position 
as its competitors.
And cutting prices to compete in a market flooded with overcapacity makes it no different to easyJet - which is 
forecast to suffer a 40 per cent fall in 2019 earnings.
For Ryanair's aircraft, then, the problem is not so much leaving the tarmac - it is looking far too much like all the 
others standing there.

THE UK'S top share index lagged other European markets yesterday as investors kept one eye on developments 
over Brexit from the ruling Conservative party's annual conference, and another on Ryanair's 13 per cent dive after 
a profit warning.
Gains in sterling on finance minister Philip Hammond's speech and a report of Brexit progress reined the FTSE 100 
back.
The FTSE 100, whose companies make 70 per cent of their earnings from abroad, fell 0.2 per cent while the 
domestically focused mid cap index rose 0.5 per cent.
Politics aside, big weight on the FTSE 100 was Royal Mail. Shares in the postal service operator sank as much as 
20 per cent after a trading statement warning full-year performance will be "significantly below target" due to labour 
market and other cost pressures impacting margins "more than anticipated".
Oil majors Shell and BP rose 0.6 and one per cent respectively, the biggest supports to the FTSE, as Brent prices 
climbed to their highest since November 2014 ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran.
Airlines, which have recently been hit by rising oil prices that could increase their fuel costs, were under further 
pressure after a profit warning from Ryanair. Europe's largest low-cost carrier cut its forecast for full-year profit by 
12 per cent and said there could be worse to come if recent coordinated strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic 
and bookings.
Housebuilders were another weak spot.
Berkeley Group, Barratt Developments, and Persimmon were among the top fallers on the FTSE, down one to 
three per cent after the Conservative Party set out plans to levy an extra fee on foreign buyers of homes in Britain.

United Utilities rose 2.6 per cent after a Deutsche Bank upgrade to buy.
Among the smaller companies, Avocet Mining plummeted 37.9 per cent after warning it could be broken up as the 
gold miner continues talks with its largest shareholder to restructure its debt.

SHARES in Ryanair were down more than 12 per cent yesterday after the airline downgraded its full-year profit 
guidance following a series of summer strikes by pilots and cabin crew.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary blamed the downgrade on lower passenger traffic and forward bookings made 
because of the strikes. It now expects to make between (EURO)1.1bn (£980m) and (EURO)1.2bn, following a 
previous profit forecast of between (EURO)1.25bn and (EURO)1.35bn. "While we successfully managed five strikes 
by 25 per cent of our Irish pilots this summer, two recent coordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU 
countries has affected passenger numbers (through flight cancellations), close in bookings and yields (as we 
reaccommodate disrupted passengers), and forward air fares into the third quarter," he said.
"While we regret these disruptions, we have on both strike days operated over 90 per cent of our schedule. 
However, customer Ryanair's share price shed 12.81 per cent in trading yesterday confidence, forward bookings 
and thirdquarter fares have been affected, most notably over the October school mid-terms and Christmas, in those 
five countries where unnecessary strikes have been repeated."
Last Friday, cabin crew members from the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy went on strike over pay 
and working conditions. Among the list of demands from the cabin crew is that they be moved over to local 
employment contracts from their current contracts, which are based in Ireland.
Ryanair also said in it would be cutting winter capacity by one per cent because of the "lower fare, higher oil" 
environment and because more customers were claiming compensation.
Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index, said: "Most of the budget airlines are facing the same pressures and are 
seeing investors walk away from their shares.

"Even Easyjet which managed to pick up additional passengers from Ryanair's cancelled flights lost 5.25 per cent 
on the day," she said.

Ryanair has cut its full-year profit guidance and warned the figure might fall further still, blaming staff strikes, 
compensation costs and the high price of oil. After the company cut its forecast from between (EURO)1.25bn and 
(EURO)1.35bn to between (EURO)1.1bn and (EURO)1.2bn, its shares fell 11 per cent to (EURO)11.67, nearing a 
threeyear low. Shares across the industry followed suit, with easyJet down 4.2 per cent and Wizz Air down 3.1 per 
cent. In the year to the end of March 2018, Ryanair made a (EURO)1.45bn profit.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said strikes by pilots and cabin crew in five countries this summer had hit 
passenger numbers, yields and future air fares. On two days of co-ordinated European strikes, Ryanair "operated 
over 90 per cent of our schedule", he said. "However, customer confidence, forward bookings and third-quarter 
fares have been affected."
Ryanair has suffered a summer of strikes across Europe, including five days by Irish pilots and the two days of co-
ordinated pan-European action by cabin crew. The airline agreed to recognise unions in late 2017 following a 
rostering failure that caused it to cancel thousands of flights but it has struggled to reach terms with most of its 
unions.

Ryanair's second-quarter fares would fall 3 per cent, instead of rising 1 per cent, the airline said, and second-half 
fares would fall 2 per cent, instead of remaining flat. The fuel bill would rise (EURO)460m, up (EURO)30m on 
previous guidance.
Mr O'Leary added: "Ryanair cannot rule out further disruptions in the third quarter, which may require full-year 
guidance to be lowered further and may necessitate further trimming of lossmaking winter capacity."
Daniel Roeska, a Bernstein analyst, said the announcement's timing, before half-year results in late October, meant 
"the management team saw no possibility to recover this" for the full year.
Capacity growth over the winter for low-cost, short-haul flights in Europe is weighing on fares: Barclays has 
estimated that growth will be more than 10 per cent in November. Ryanair said it would cut its capacity 1 per cent 
this winter, closing three bases in Germany and the Netherlands, where staff have been involved in the strike 
action. The Dutch VNV pilots' union linked the closure to poor industrial relations. The full-year guidance excluded 
Ryanair's investment in Laudamotion, a small Austrian airline, which the company expects to produce exceptional 
losses of (EURO)150m this year. Lombard page 18

Ryanair, the low-cost airline, has cut its full-year profit guidance and warned the figure may fall further still, blaming 
staff strikes, resulting compensation costs and the high price of oil.
After the company cut its profit forecast from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn 
yesterday, the shares fell 11 per cent to (EURO)11.67, nearing a threeyear low. Shares across the industry followed 
suit, with EasyJet down 4.2 per cent and Wizz Air 3.1 per cent. In the year to the end of March 2018, Ryanair made 
(EURO)1.45bn profit.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said strikes by pilots and cabin crew in five countries this summer had hit 
passenger numbers, yields and future air fares. On two days of co-ordinated European strikes, Ryanair "operated 
over 90 per cent of our schedule", he said. "However, customer confidence, forward bookings and third-quarter 
fares have been affected."
Ryanair has suffered a summer of strikes across Europe, including five days by Irish pilots and the two days of co-
ordinated pan-European action by cabin crew. The airline agreed to recognise unions in late 2017 following a 
rostering failure that caused it to cancel thousands of flights, but has struggled to reach terms with most of its 
unions.

confidence
Second-quarter fares would fall 3 per cent, instead of rising 1 per cent, the airline said, and second-half fares would 
fall 2 per cent, instead of remaining flat. The fuel bill would rise (EURO)460m, up (EURO)30m on previous 
guidance.
Mr O'Leary added: "Ryanair cannot rule out further disruptions in the third quarter, which may require full-year 
guidance to be lowered further and may necessitate further trimming of lossmaking winter capacity."
Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, said the timing of the announcement, before Ryanair published its half-year 
results in late October, meant "the management team saw no possibility to recover this" for the full year.
Capacity growth over the winter for low-cost, short-haul flights in Europe is weighing on fares: Barclays has 
estimated that growth will be more than 10 per cent in November. Ryanair said that it would cut its capacity by 1 per 
cent this winter, closing three bases in Germany and the Netherlands. Staff in those two countries have been 
involved in the strike action, and the Dutch VNV pilots' union linked the closure to poor industrial relations, calling it 
"the standard fear-mongering rhetoric of Ryanair". Ryanair said it could not comment because it was in a closed 
period before its results.
The full-year guidance excluded Ryanair's investment in Laudamotion, a small Austrian airline, from which it 
expects exceptional losses of (EURO)150m.
Last week, EasyJet said pre-tax profit for 2018 would be at the higher end of its range but predicted revenue per 
seat in the first half of 2019 would decrease by low-to-mid single digits.

 Ryanair's (RYAAY) Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs, said Tuesday in a news conference in Madrid the 
company was looking to reach deals with European trade unions by Christmas and implement them next year.
"We want to have agreements in place with crew and pilots by Christmas," Jacobs told journalists, adding that the 
airline accepted demands from Spanish unions to hire local staff on Spanish contracts.
Ryanair on Monday reduced its full-year profit forecast by 12%, and warned that worse may follow if  the recent 
strikes across Europe continue to affect traffic and bookings.

Investors had been "particularly nervous about China's stance on the deal given the deterioration in US-Sino trading

Ryanair was sharply lower - down 12.4 per cent - after the airline group warned about strike disruption and fuel 
costs.
Its full-year net profit guidance fell from (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn to (EURO)1.1bn-(EURO)1.2bn, though the 
market consensus had already moved just below that range to take account of Ryanair's purchase of lossmaking 
Austrian low-cost airline Laudamotion in August.
"Sector risk perception has deteriorated, with some early signs of macro softening in the sector, rising fuel prices 
and a higher risk of a hard Brexit - we think the sector may struggle to recover at least until Brexit uncertainty has 
been dispelled," said SocGen.

Royal Mail suffered the biggest daily fall since its 2013 flotation after warning that cost savings were not coming 
through as expected.
Full-year core earnings would be as low as £500m, the group warned, compared with a £651m consensus.
Airlines retreated on a profit warning from Ryanair, which blamed fuel costs as well as disruption from strikes.
Bernstein advised selling easyJet, saying the group would struggle to pass on rising fuel prices to passengers when 
Europe faced a "flood" of new capacity next year, particularly on short-haul routes. It forecast easyJet's 2019 
earnings to drop 40 per cent year on year.
Berkeley led the housebuilders lower after the Conservative party proposed a stamp duty surcharge on foreign 
buyers.
More than four-fifths of Berkeley's portfolio is in London and about half its buyers are from overseas, said analysts.

 European equity benchmarks were advancing on Monday, with trading sentiment was lifted by news that the US 
and Canada had reached an agreement on trade which will replace the former North American Free Trade 
Agreement after more than a year of negotiations.
The new deal, which is known as the United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement, aims to result in freer markets 
and robust economic growth, according to a joint statement issued by Robert Lighthizer, the US trade 
representative and Chrystia Freeland, Canada's foreign affairs minister.
In other economic news, Germany posted its latest data on retail turnover, which showed a 1.6% jump year on year 
and a 0.1% decline from the previous month in real terms, according to Destatis, Germany's federal statistics office. 
In equities, low-cost airline Ryanair was leading the decliners on the pan-European Stoxx 600 Index, down by 9.3% 
after it issued a profit warning early Monday, blaming coordinated industrial action and higher oil prices for its 
revised profit outlook for the fiscal year. Rival airlines easyJet and Air France KLM were 2.5% and 3.0% lower on 
the index, respectively. Finnish industrial machinery company Metso, and Trelleborg AB Series B, an engineering 
group, were 3.0% and 2.7% lower, respectively. 
Gainers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 Index were led by chemical company Linde, 6.0% higher, followed by 
medical devices manufacturer Ambu A/S Series B, up by 4.3% and Zalando, 4.4% higher.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index was 0.27% higher, London's FTSE 100 Index was up by 0.09%, Frankfurt's 
DAX was 0.55% higher and Paris' CAC-40 was up by 0.27% at the time of writing.

to approve a Canada-less NAFTA and President Trump didn't have the clear authority to withdraw from the existing 
agreement.
The US-China outlook, meanwhile, continues to deteriorate as trade disputes bleed out to other realms of the 
relationship, the bank said. JPMorgan's economists on Friday changed their US-China assumptions and were now 
modeling a 25% tariff imposed on all Chinese imports starting in 2019.
Economic data released Monday morning was generally underwhelming: manufacturing PMIs came in below 
forecast in China, Japan and Europe while German retail sales, Macau gaming revenues and South Korean exports 
also fell short.
Trading in Asia was very quiet as Hong Kong and mainland China were closed. TPX rose 0.04%, NKY rose 0.52%, 
Taiwan rose 0.41%, South Korea fell 0.18%, Australia fell 0.57% and India closed about 20 points higher.  
The major Eurozone indices were trading higher thanks to the US-NAFTA news; outperformers included autos, 
basic resources, chemicals, tech and energy while staples, banks, real estate and healthcare lagged. The Italian 
FTSEMIB rebounded 1% after falling Friday on the budget news. Investors await comments out of the EU on Italy's 
budget proposal as Italian finance officials gather in Luxembourg this morning. 
Linde shares were among the top performers in the Eurostoxx after China approved the PX deal (over the 
weekend) while Ryanair led to the downside following a negative profit update. The dollar index was unchanged, 
while the loonie rallied about 80 points on the NAFTA news. Tesla shares were rallying 15% pre-open following the 
Musk and SEC settlement.

 Europe's biggest budget airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) issued a profit warning early Monday, blaming 
coordinated industrial action and higher oil prices for its revised profit outlook for the fiscal year.
The carrier said in a trading statement that pre-tax profit in fiscal 2019 is now expected to come in a new range of 
1.10 -1.20 billion euros ($1.28-1.39 billion) compared with a previous estimate of 1.25-1.35 billion euros.   
In September, Ryanair reported two coordinated strikes in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, which 
it claimed occurred despite the airline agreeing to meet union demands for local contracts, local law, and a five-
week arbitration with pilots in Germany when the VC Union sought a prolonged five-month arbitration.
It said that second-quarter fares were down about 3% - versus a previous forecast of an increase of 1% - because 
of the weakness caused to close-in bookings and fares, which it said were mainly the result of the two five-nation 
strikes. 
"We had until last week expected stronger third-quarter fares to recover softer second-quarter yields but over the 
past week third-quarter fares, and customer confidence, have been affected by worries about possible strikes," the 
company said in the statement. "We are now guiding second-half fares down 2% (previously flat)."
Ryanair noted that the strikes also added to its flight-compensation EU261 costs while, concurrently, it said that the 
unhedged fuel costs have also jumped as oil prices increased to $82 per barrel. It warned that the fuel bill would be 
about 460 million euros higher - versus a previous guidance of 430 million euros - from a year ago.
In response to the lower fare, higher oil prices, and the elevated EU261 cost environment, the budget airline said it 
has decided to trim its winter 2018 capacity by 1%.

 Stocks in the US were mostly in the green on the Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average led the gains as 
investors cheered a new trade deal between the world's biggest economy and its neighbors, Canada and Mexico. 
The blue-chip measure rose for a third straight day, coming within less than 100 points of the record high it reached 
last month as trade-sensitive names advanced. Boeing (BA) rose 2.9% and Chevron (CVX) advanced 1.8% as oil 
prices surged. 
The jump in crude futures led the Standard & Poor's 500 energy sector to the best rise among the groups, ending 
1.5% in the green by the bell. ConocoPhillips (COP) gained 3.2% after saying it agreed to sell to the government of 
Timor-Leste in southeast Asia its 30% interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields. 
On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite gave back its earlier advance as Intel (INTC) weighed after downbeat 
analyst comments. The chipmaker fell 1.8%. American Airlines (AAL) dropped 4.2% on a negative day for airline 
stocks after a profit warning from Irish carrier Ryanair (RYAAY), which plunged 15%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2.1% 
and JetBlue (JBLU) decreased 1.9%. 
But the tone on the day was generally upbeat after the US, Mexico and Canada trade deal reached late Sunday 
night set in motion a buying spree that included gains in the auto and materials sector. General Motors (GM) rose 
1.6% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) climbed 2.7% after a new management team was named for the carmaker.
The trade news helped overshadow some downbeat economic data that included a below-consensus 0.1% 
increase in construction spending for August, and a slight decline in the ISM manufacturing index to 59.8 in 
September from 61.3 in August, missing the 59.9 estimates. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also offered 
a warned about a "less bright" outlook for global economic growth. 
By the close, the Dow rose 0.7%, the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq was down by 0.1%.

 London stocks were mixed early Monday, with a profit warning from Ryanair leading to bumpy trade for FTSE 100-
listed airline stocks easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines.
In focus in the UK on Monday is September's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which is expected to 
decline slightly from August.
The FTSE 100 was down 0.1%, or 8.30 points, at 7,501.90. The FTSE 250 was up 0.3%, or 51.86 points, at 
20,358.90 while the AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 1,099.55.
The Cboe UK 100 was down 0.3% at 12,723.19. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 18,456.53 and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies down 0.1% at 12,133.50.
Over in mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris and DAX 30 in Frankfurt were up 0.1% and 0.3% higher respectively. 
Sinking 7.7% in early trade was Ryanair after cutting its annual profit guidance by 12% due to higher oil prices and 
strikes.
Profit guidance for its current financial year ending March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to 
EUR1.20 billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion seen previously, as a result of lower traffic and weaker 
fares in September, caused by two years of coordinated strikes across Europe.
Fares for the second half of the year are guided to be down 2%, from its previous expectation of remaining flat from 
the year before, and slower traffic growth is expected to cut traffic for the full year to 138 million, from the previous 
guidance of 139 million.
The budget Irish airline added that it cannot rule out further disruptions in the third quarter ending December, which 
could see its profit guidance lowered even more.

The update from Ryanair hit easyJet in a negative read-across, down 4.5% and the FTSE 100's worst performer 
early Monday, while British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines was down 2.5%.
Towards the other end of the index, United Utilities gained 1.3% after Deutsche Bank raised the water firm to Buy 
from Hold.
RSA Insurance was also benefiting from a broker rating upgrade, 1.3% higher after Berenberg raised the stock to 
Buy from Hold.
Just Group was at the bottom of the mid-caps, down 7.6% after announcing its chief financial officer of 12 years will 
be stepping down. 
Simon Thomas is to step down as chief financial officer at the end of October. David Richardson, currently deputy 
chief executive officer and managing director of UK corporate business, be appointed interim CFO in addition to his 
current responsibilities. The search for a permanent replacement for Thomas is now underway, Just Group said.
The economic calendar on Monday has manufacturing PMIs from France, Germany, the eurozone and the UK at 
0850 BST, 0855 BST, 0900 BST and 0930 BST respectively. In the US, the Markit manufacturing PMI is at 1445 
BST while the ISM manufacturing PMI is at 1500 BST.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3039 early Monday ahead of the manufacturing data, soft compared to USD1.3048 at 
the London equities close on Friday.
The UK manufacturing reading is seen declining slightly to 52.5 in September from the 52.8 posted for last month.
Already released, manufacturing data from China overnight showed the country's manufacturing sector weakened 
in September amidst an ongoing trade war with the US.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index stood at 50.8 in September, a drop from August's 51.3, 
according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, and below consensus of 51.2.
The independent Caixin manufacturing PMI fell from 50.6 in August to 50, the lowest level in more than one year. 
Any score above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, while a reading below the mark indicates contraction.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5%. Markets in China are closed this week for the 
National Day holiday, though Hong Kong will re-open on Tuesday.
Back in the UK, the Conservative Party conference kicked off on Sunday amid intense debate over Prime Minister 
Theresa May's "Chequers" strategy.
The four-day event, taking place in Birmingham, comes with speculation that eurosceptics could challenge May's 
leadership in order to steer Britain towards a Canada-style free-trade deal after Brexit.
In an interview published in the Sunday Times just hours before the conference kicked off, former foreign secretary 
Boris Johnson described May's plan for leaving the EU as "deranged" and "preposterous."
Johnson will be speaking at a conference fringe event on Tuesday, while May delivers a closing speech on 
Wednesday. In the address, she is expected to urge the party to rally behind her Brexit deal as well as focusing on 
immigration.

 Stocks in London ended mixed on Monday, as sharp falls from Royal Mail, airlines and housebuilders stocks saw 
the FTSE 100 slip below the 7,500 mark.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 14.53 points at 7,495.67. The FTSE 250 ended up 0.5%, or 94.17 
points, at 20,401.21, and the AIM All-Share closed up 0.3%, or 3.11 points, at 1,101.61.
The Cboe UK 100 ended down 0.3% at 12,727.98, the Cboe 250 closed up 0.4% at 18,514.60, and the Cboe Small 
Companies ended 0.1% lower at 12,135.16.
On the London Stock Exchange, Rentokil Initial ended up 3.6% as the pest control firm acquired outsourcer Mitie 
Group's pest control unit for GBP40 million in cash.
RSA Insurance closed up 2.8% after Berenberg raised the insurer to Buy from Hold, believing there was an "over-
reaction" to last week's weather-battered trading update.
Languishing at the other end of the large cap index, Royal Mail ended the the worst performer down 18% after the 
postal operator forecast lower full-year profit amid challenging conditions in the UK. 
Royal Mail revised its adjusted operating profit before transformation costs down to between GBP500 million and 
GBP550 million for its full financial year ending March. This compares to a GBP694 million adjusted operating profit 
the year before.
Royal Mail's UK productivity performance was "significantly below plan" at just 0.1% in the first half of its financial 
year with full year performance expected to be "significantly below target" at the upper end of the 2% to 3% range.
As such, cost savings targets have subsequently been dropped to GBP100 million from GBP230 million with plans 
to implement "a range of short-term cost actions" being enacted.

"This is a cause for concern for many investors despite the fact that management have stated that the attractive 
dividend will be unaffected. We would hope that the parcels and GLS business can continue with their rapid growth. 
A stalling here, caused by perhaps industrial action or competitive pressures, will surely result in further troubles for 
the group," said Share Centre analyst Helal Miah.
Blue chip airlines were also reeling in the wake of a profit warning from Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings, which cut its 
forecast for full-year profit, citing rising oil prices and the impact of recent coordinated strikes across Europe.
Ryanair shares closed down 13% while peers easyJet and British Airways parent International Consolidated 
Airlines Group ended down 7.0% and 2.6% respectively. 
Ryanair's profit guidance for the year to the end of March 31, 2019, was lowered to a range of EUR1.10 billion to 
EUR1.20 billion, from EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion. For 2018 financial year, pretax profit increased 10% year-
on-year to EUR1.61 billion from EUR1.47 billion in 2017 financial year. 
The Irish budget airline also attributed the cut in profit guidance to increased care and re-acommodation expenses 
as a result of strikes and fall in forward bookings. 
In addition, Ryanair said it could not rule out further disruptions in the third quarter ending December, which could 
see its profit guidance lowered even more.
In addition, housebuilders also ended among the worst blue chip performers after UK Prime Minister Theresa May 
over the weekend announced plans for a stamp duty surcharge of between 1% and 3% to be imposed on sales of 
property to foreign nationals who do not pay UK tax. 
Berkeley Group closed down 3.4%, Persimmon down 1.9%, Barratt Developments down 1.6%, Taylor Wimpey 
down 2.0%. 
The capital raised would go towards measures to tackle rough sleeping, and is designed to ease pressure on the 
housing market and make homes more affordable. 
Analysts at Shore Capital called the idea "ill-judged" and a move that plays on the idea that overseas house buyers 
leave the properties empty.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3040 at the London equities close, compared to USD1.3048 at the close on Friday, 
despite data showing that UK manufacturing sector activity saw an unexpected upturn in the month of September.
The UK manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in September, survey data from IHS Markit and Chartered 
Institute of Procurement & Supply showed. 
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in September from 53.0 in August, which was revised 
up from 52.8. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
"The reaction in the forex market has been very much mute as the bigger focus remains on the Brexit related 
issues. But the silver lining is that the manufacturing data is still above the critical level of 50 which shows 
expansion but the net lending numbers are dropping and this shows that credit conditions are not becoming better 
in the country," said ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam.
As the Conservative Party conference rolled on in Birmingham, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond 
used his keynote speech as a rallying cry to urge fellow party members to "stand together" as Prime Minister 
Theresa May seeks to secure a Brexit deal based on her Chequers plan.
The chancellor promised he would maintain "enough fiscal firepower" to support the economy in the case of a no-
deal Brexit.

Declaring that the Conservatives remained "the party of business", Hammond announced reforms of the 
apprenticeship levy to meet companies' concerns as well as a GBP125 million package to boost the number of well-
paid jobs across the UK.
Hammond could not resist making a few jibes at the Labour party's expense as he denounced the opposition as a 
"backward-looking party" which is "totally unfit to govern", he said.
The Runnymede and Weybridge MP won applause from activists as he declared: "Jeremy Corbyn boasts that 
Labour are a government-in-waiting. Well, I say let's keep him waiting, this year, next year and every year".
In Paris the CAC 40 ended up 0.2%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended up 0.8%. 
The euro stood at USD1.1566 at the European equities close, against USD1.1619 late Friday, despite the jobless 
rate in the eurozone falling to its lowest level in a decade. 
Unemployment in the eurozone dropped to 8.1% in August, the lowest rate since November 2008, according to 
data from the EU's statistics agency Eurostat.
Across the 19-country currency bloc, 13.2 million people were without a job in August, according to the figures from 
Eurostat. The figure represents a fall of 0.1 percentage point from July.
Stocks in New York were higher at the London equities close amid optimism over US and Canadian officials 
agreeing a trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement shortly before a midnight deadline.
The DJIA was up 1%, the S&P 500 index up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.5%.
The new trade deal, called the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will reportedly provide more market 
access to US dairy farmers and effectively cap Canadian automobile exports to the US.
In a joint statement US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia 
Freeland said the agreement will "strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new 
opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home".
US President Donald Trump, a harsh critic of NAFTA, praised the USMCA as a "historic transaction" in a post on 
Twitter on Monday.
The leaders of the US, Canada, and Mexico are expected to sign the new agreement before the end of November, 
although it will still need to be approved by Congress.
Elsewhere, US Federal Chair Jerome Powell will speak at the National Association for Business Economics' annual 
meeting on Tuesday at 1745 BST. 
Brent oil was higher quoted at USD84.70 a barrel at the London equities close from USD82.85 at the close Friday, 
its highest level since November 2014. 
Investors widely expect the North Sea benchmark to hit USD100 per barrel for the first time since 2015's crash 
amid rising geopolitical risks, including looming US sanctions on Iran, which will come into effect on November 4.
The sanctions would squeeze Iranian crude exports, hitting the market despite other exporters increasing supply.
Oil prices also remain supported by supply disruptions in places such as Venezuela and the recent decision of the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to leave production steady.
Gold was quoted at USD1,188.75 an ounce at the London equities close against USD1,192.70 late Friday.

The economic events calendar on Tuesday has UK Nationwide house price index and construction PMI data at

China are closed for the National Day Golden Week holiday.

European Stocks End Mostly Higher Amid Easing Trade Concerns
In economic news, Eurozone manufacturing activity grew at the weakest pace in two years in September, final data 
from IHS Markit showed. The factory Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 53.2 from 54.6 in August, hitting the lowest 
level since September of 2016. The initial estimate was 53.3.
The euro area jobless rate fell to 8.1% in August from 8.2% in July, Eurostat reported. This was the lowest since 
November of 2008.
German retail sales grew by real 1.6% year-on-year in August, faster than the 0.9% expansion seen a month ago, 
figures from Destatis showed. The annual rate came in line with expectations.
The UK manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in September, survey data from IHS Markit and Chartered 
Institute of Procurement & Supply showed.
The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.8 in September from 53.0 in August, which was 
upwardly revised from 52.8.
The pound rose after Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the EU was in the mood to do a divorce 
deal, but uncertainty over Brexit had already hit the UK's economy.

Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12% on Monday and said worse may be to come if recent coordinated 
strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has faced multiple strikes since it bowed to pressure to recognize trade unions for 
the first time last December and they have escalated in recent months as it makes slow progress in talks with some 
unions .
The Irish airline said it now expects profit for the year, excluding start up losses in Laudamotion, to come in 
between 1.10-1.20 billion euros, compared with its prior forecast of 1.25-1.35 billion euros.
It added that it could not rule out further disruptions in the coming months, which may require full-year forecasts to 
be lowered again and further cuts to its loss-making winter capacity.
Shares in the airline were 8.6% lower at 11.99 euros by 0710 GMT.
Ryanair said fares in its second quarter to end-September had fallen by around 3% compared with its previous 
forecast for a drop of 1 percent and said that it now expects fares in the second half to be 2% lower.
To cope with lower fares, higher oil prices and strike costs, Ryanair has trimmed its winter capacity by 1%, 
removing aircraft from its Eindhoven, Bremen and Niederrhein bases.
"Two recent coordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries have affected passenger 
numbers, close in bookings and yields, and forward air fares into Q3," Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said in a 
statement.

Ex-Ryanair and Stellwagen executives are to launch a new aircraft lessor via a planned initial public offering.
Sirius Aviation Capital plans to raise $250 million on the London stock exchange for Sirius Aircraft Leasing Fund 
(SALF) to invest mainly in used single-aisle aircraft.
“Globally we intend to leverage this capability to access portfolios of in demand single-aisle aircraft (with leases 
attached), principally from lessors disposing of older aircraft in order to maintain the average age of their fleet,” said 
Howard Millar, chief executive officer of Sirius Aviation Capital.
The company believes there is growing demand for used aircraft and a liquid secondary leasing market “with large 
airline operators such as International Airlines Group and Lufthansa active operators of these older aircraft”.
Millar was deputy chief executive at Ryanair until 2014 before a spell as chief executive of aviation financier 
Stellwagen Capital.
Two other ex-Stellwagen executives, Edward Coughlan and Edward Hansom, will serve as Sirius’s chief 
commercial officer and chief investment officer, respectively.
Millar, Coughlan and Hansom resigned from Stellwagen in acrimonious circumstances in late 2017, when 
Stellwagen Group's CEO Douglas Brennan accused them of attempting to divert valuable business away from the 
company.Another former Stellwagen executive, Kieran Ryan, will be Sirius’s chief financial officer.
In addition to Sirius’s IPO, the company is launching a 12-month placing programme for up to a further 300 million 
ordinary shares and/or C shares.
Sirius is targeting an annualised dividend yield of 8% and a long-term IRR of 10% per annum.
Millar says that the funds raised from the IPO should be invested within six months of its completion.
Liberum Capital is acting as sponsor in relation to the share issue, and is working alongside J&E Davy as joint 
financial adviser and joint placing agent.
Further details will be set out in the company's prospectus, which is expected to be published in late October.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks turned in a strong performance on Monday 
amid easing trade concerns after the U.S. and Canada agreed on a trade deal to replace the North American Free 
Trade Agreement shortly before a midnight deadline.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose by 0.3 
percent, while the Euro Stoxx 50 Index of eurozone blue chip stocks climbed by 0.5 percent.  The German DAX 
Index also advanced by 0.8 percent and the French CAC 40 Index crept up by 0.2 percent, while U.K.'s FTSE 100 
Index bucked the uptrend and edged down by 0.2 percent. 
 The new trade deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will reportedly provide more 
market access to U.S. dairy farmers and effectively cap Canadian automobile exports to the U.S.  A joint statement 
by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the 
USMCA will 'strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly 
half billion people who call North America home.'   'We look forward to further deepening our close economic ties 
when this new agreement enters into force,' Lighthizer and Freeland added.  The leaders of the U.S., Canada, and 
Mexico are expected to sign the new agreement before the end of November, although it will still need to be 
approved by Congress.  Swiss bakery business Aryzta spiked 16.4 percent after the company forecast stable 
underlying results in fiscal 2019 after narrowing its fiscal 2018 loss.   Linde AG also moved higher after the 
company received approval for its proposed $83 billion merger with Praxair from the Chinese antitrust authority.  On 
the other hand, Ryanair slumped 12.8 in London. The airline cut its forecast for full-year profit, citing rising oil prices

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) announced Monday that it has lowered its full 
year profit guidance, excluding Laudamotion, to a new range of 1.10 billion euros to 1.20 billion euros from the 
previously expected range of 1.25 billion euros to 1.35 billion euros.  The company's cut in fiscal 2019 guidance by 
12% is due to higher oil prices, higher EU261 costs, & weaker fares due to recent strikes.  The company reported 
lower traffic and weaker close in fares in September, caused by 2 days of coordinated pilot/cabin crew strikes in 
Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. 
 Lower Q3 fares also reported as forward bookings, particularly for the Oct school mid-terms and Christmas, and 
customer confidence are affected by fear of further strikes.  Ryanair noted that Q2 & Q3 traffic and fares will be 
somewhat lower than expected largely as a result of these 2 recent -5 country- strikes, which are being incited by 
competitor employees. This is despite the fact that Ryanair has agreed to meet union demands for local contracts, 
local law, and a 5 week arbitration with pilots in Germany when the VC Union sought a prolonged 5 month 
arbitration.  The company is now guiding H2 fares down 2%, compared to previous estimate of flat. Fuel bill will now 
be approximately 460 million euros higher than last year, compared to previous estimate of 430 million euros 
higher.  Further, slower traffic growth in H2 will cut FY19 traffic to 138 million, in comparison to previous estimate of 
139 million excluding Laudamotion.  Ryanair added that it cannot rule out further disruptions in Q3, which may 
require full year guidance to be lowered further and may necessitate further trimming of loss making winter 
capacity.  Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said, 'While we regret these disruptions, we have on both strike days operated 
over 90% of our schedule. However, customer confidence, forward bookings and Q3 fares has been affected, most 
notably over the Oct school mid-terms and Christmas, in those 5 countries where unnecessary strikes have been 
repeated.'   In London, Ryanair shares were trading at 11.88 euros, down 9.42 percent.

Ryanair predicts strike and Laudamotion costs

Strike action has caused Ryanair to lower its 2018/19 profit guidance by roughly 12% to between &euro;1.1 billion 
($1.28 billion) and &euro;1.2 billion.
Furthermore, the airline’s consolidated result should be lower still once Ryanair includes an estimated &euro;150 
million of start-up losses attributable to its recently acquired Laudamotion operation.
The Irish low-cost carrier blamed cabin and flight crew strikes across five countries in September as well as lower 
forward bookings due to fears of further industrial action for the reduction from its previous guidance of &euro;1.25 
billion to &euro;1.35.
“While we successfully managed five strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, two recent coordinated strikes 
by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries has affected passenger numbers (through flight cancellations), 
close in bookings and yields (as we re-accommodate disrupted passengers), and forward air fares into Q3,” says 
Ryanair chief executive officer, Michael O’Leary.
In response to lower air fares and higher oil prices Ryanair will trim its winter 2018 capacity by 1%, and the airline 
warns that further capacity reductions may result from additional strike action. It adds that profit forecasts may be 
lowered again if more strikes occur in the third quarter.
O’Leary highlights “substantial progress” with labour negotiations in Ireland, the UK and Italy since it agreed to 
recognise unions in December 2017.
“Regrettably such progress has been impeded in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Holland, and Belgium where we’ve 
experienced interference in negotiations with our people and their unions, even when we offer them what they ask 
for (i.e. local contracts), in writing,” he adds.

Big rises in staff and fuel costs cut into Ryanair’s margin for the first half of the year, despite a 27% increase in 
ancillary revenues.
The low-cost carrier transported 6% more passengers in the six months to 30 September, but saw its operating 
margin decline from 50% to 36%. Operating profit for H1 2018/19 was &euro;1.3 billion ($1.5 billion), compared with 
&euro;1.48 billion in the prior-year period.
During the first half Ryanair implemented a 20% increase to pilot wages and a 3% increase for non-flight staff.
Depreciation costs also rose, by 14% to &euro;319 million, as the carrier put an additional 53 owned aircraft on to 
its balance sheet.
Also weighing on costs was the airline’s takeover of Laudamotion, for which Ryanair predicts &euro;150 million of 
start-up losses for the full-year.
Overall, Ryanair’s first-half cash flow swung from &euro;313 million to negative &euro;222 million due to its poorer 
operating result.
Earlier in October, the airline lowered its full-year profit guidance by 12% to &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.2 billion – a 
forecast it has retained.
Disruption from strikes caused the airline to cut its forecast, and Ryanair says further industrial action is possible, 
“but we expect [its] impact to be very limited”.
Other concerns for the airline include Europe’s soft airfare environment and the possibility of further fuel price 
increases.
Ryanair has hedged 90% of its fuel requirements for the next 12 months at $68 per barrel.
“Full-year guidance remains heavily dependent on airfares not declining further (they remain soft this winter due to 
excess capacity in Europe), the impact of significantly higher oil prices on our unhedged exposures, the absence of 
unforeseen security events, ATC and other strikes and the impact of negative Brexit developments,” states Ryanair 
CEO Michael O’Leary.

UK SHARES fell only slightly on Friday while bourses on the continent sustained heavy losses after the Italian 
government set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with 
Brussels.
The FTSE 100 fell 0.5 per cent while the Eurozone Stoxx 50 index lost 1.4 per cent and Milan sank 3.7 per cent. 
Insulated from concerns over Italy and the Eurozone, the top UK index ended the month with a one per cent gain 
but was down 1.6 per cent on the quarter after three months of turmoil in Brexit negotiations.
Financials weighed the most with RSA Insurance Group falling eight per cent after it reported an underwriting loss 
of about £70m in the third quarter due to bad weather, large losses and claims.
British insurers have taken a beating from a run of volatile weather, with the hottest summer in living memory 
following a blast of icy weather earlier in the year dubbed the "Beast from the East".
"Negatively, although the Solvency II coverage ratio is above its targeted range, management said these losses 
could impact the dividend growth decision for the full year," wrote KBW analysts.
Easyjet shares fell 0.9 per cent despite the budget carrier forecasting annual profit at the upper end of expectations, 
as it benefited from robust flight demand and cancellations at bigger rival Ryanair in 2018.
Randgold Resources ended the day up 3.6 per cent, the top FTSE 100 riser. Having fallen earlier in the session 
after Congo's state miner warned Randgold it would "assert its rights" in the DRC-based Kibali mine in the planned 
acquisition by Barrick Gold, the stock recovered after Randgold refuted the miner's claim.
Among mid-caps, outsourcer Serco was a top performer, up 11.8 per cent after it reported full-year profit and 
revenue above market expectations.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passengers, has issued a profit warning for the year amid 
strikes and rising fuel prices.
The low-cost carrier says Monday it has lowered its guidance by 12 percent to between 1.1 billion euros ($1.28 
billion) and 1.2 billion euros for the full year.
Pilot and cabin crew strikes in September hit passenger numbers and resulted in passenger compensation costs.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says that while the strikes have been successfully managed "customer 
confidence, forward bookings and Q3 fares has been affected, most notably over the October school mid-terms and 
Christmas." Second and third-quarter traffic and airfares will be "somewhat lower than expected" as a result.
The airline says more staff strikes could force the company to issue further profit warnings.

Shares in Ryanair (RYA.I) have slumped after the budget airline group issued a profit warning as strikes by staff 
continue to take their toll on the business.
The shares slumped 9% to €11.94 as the group said full-year profits were likely to be 12% lower than previously 
forecast.
The news knocked shares in rival airliners. EasyJet (EZJ) fell to the bottom of a rising FTSE 100, down 2.6% at 
£12.81, as the index edged nine points higher to 7,519.
British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG) was down 1% at 653.2p while on the FTSE 250, Wizz 
Air (WIZZ) fell 2.6% to £28.03.
Ryanair's fall will weigh on a number of Europe-focused fund managers with high conviction positions in the 
shares. 
Ryanair is the top holding for Citywire AA-rated Rory Powe in his £1.7 billion Man GLG Continental European 
Growth  fund, accounting for 6.2% of the portfolio.
Niall Gallagher holds 4% of the £1.7 billion GAM Star Continental European Equity  fund in the stock, while Citywire 
AAA-rated Stephen Paice, Moritz Sitte and Tom Walsh hold 3.4% of their £474 million Baillie Gifford European  
fund in Ryanair shares.
'A cocktail on problems has left Ryanair looking very weak and its shares trading at a two-year low,' said Russ 
Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
'Strikes are disrupting its business and making individuals less confident over using Ryanair in the future in case 
their flights are also delayed or cancelled,' he added.

'Costs are going up, prices are coming down as a result of weaker forward bookings and now it has a surplus of 
winter cabin crew after cutting some flights.'
EasyJet was meanwhile joined at the bottom of the FTSE 100 by house builders, as the government announced 
plans for extra fees for foreign buyers of UK homes.
Berkeley (BKGH) fell 2.6% to £12.80, Persimmon (PSN) was down 1.7% at £23.25 and Taylor Wimpey (TW) fell 
1.1% to 170p.

Update: Shares in Royal Mail (RMG) have tumbled after the group warned profits could fall by as much as 28% this 
year and slashed its cost-cutting target.
The stock slumped 18% to 391.4p after the unscheduled trading update issued this afternoon. Royal Mail said 
profits could fall to as low as £500 million for the year, down from last year's £694 million.
Cost reduction targets have been cut from £230 million to £100 million as UK productivity performance languishes 
'significantly below plan'.
'Trading conditions in the UK are challenging,' said chief executive Rico Back.
'Our letter volumes, especially marketing mail, are impacted by ongoing structural decline, business uncertainty and

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said pre-market Monday that it has lowered its FY2019 profit guidance to a range of 
EUR1.10 billion to EUR1.20 billion ($1.27 billion to $1.39 billion) from the previous range of EUR1.25 billion to 
EUR1.35 billion.
The Irish budget carrier said that the lowered guidance was due to lower traffic and weaker close-in fares due to 
recent strikes, higher care and re-accommodation costs, lower Q3 fares as forward bookings and higher energy 
prices. It also projected that Q2 & Q3 traffic and fares would be lower than expected largely as a result of the 
industrial action.
CEO Michael O'Leary also said that the company was reducing its winter 2018 capacity by 1% in response to the 
lower fare, higher oil and higher cost environment.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - French stocks bounced back from losses in the previous 
session on Monday amid easing trade concerns after the U.S. and Canada reached an agreement on a framework 
North American Free Trade Agreement deal.  The benchmark CAC 40 was up 15 points or 0.27 percent at 5,507 in 
opening deals after declining 0.9 percent on Friday.   Eurofins Scientific dropped 1.3 percent after it announced an 
agreement with the JSTI Group to acquire TestAmerica Environmental Services LLC.  Air-France KLM shares fell 
1.6 percent after rival Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit, citing rising oil prices and the impact of recent 
coordinated strikes across Europe.   Supermarket group Casino advanced 1.4 percent after it agreed to sell some 
property assets for 565 million euros to reduce debt levels.   In economic releases, Eurozone manufacturing activity 
grew at the weakest pace in two years in September, final data from IHS Markit showed.   The factory Purchasing 
Managers' Index fell to 53.2, the lowest since September 2016, from 54.6 in August. The initial estimate was 53.3.   
France saw a solid expansion, but the weakest in three months.

Lufthansa and Laudamotion have settled a dispute over leasing contracts, avoiding a London court hearing set for 
November.
To resolve the dispute, in the first half of 2019 the Austrian airline will return nine aircraft leased from Lufthansa.
“Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Laudamotion GmbH confirm that they have agreed that Laudamotion will redeliver the 
nine aircraft to Lufthansa by agreement on dates between 31 December 2018 and 30 June 2019 and on that basis 
the Parties have settled the litigation between them regarding the disputed termination of nine A320 and A321 
aircraft leases. The matter will not therefore be heard by the High Court in London in November 2018,” 
Laudamotion said in an statement seen by Airfinance Journal.
The German flag carrier said in July it wanted to end an agreement to lease aircraft to Laudamotion, claiming the 
Austrian leisure airline had failed to meet payments. Laudamotion rejected the allegations and a London court was 
scheduled to hear the case next month.
In August, Laudamotion's new owner, Ryanair, confirmed plans for the airline to receive nine additional Airbus A320 
aircraft by summer 2019.

German labour union Verdi on Saturday hailed Ryanair flight attendants and pilots in Germany for their participation 
in a 24-hour Europe-wide strike, despite increasing pressure from their employer.
The airline staff's contribution to the strike was "all the more courageous because the employees participated 
despite great pressure," a Verdi spokeswoman told dpa on Saturday in Berlin.
Airline representatives had threatened to close locations ahead of the labour action, but the cabin crew and pilots 
were not deterred. The 24-hour strike ended overnight on Friday."We hope that Ryanair has understood the signal 
and finally puts a decent offer on the table," the Verdi spokeswoman said. The airline's staff is calling for increased 
wages and better working conditions in accordance with different countries' respective national laws.
The second Europe-wide strike by Ryanair pilots and flight attendants involved not only Germany, but also 
employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.
At least 250 flights were cancelled on Friday due to the strike, constituting about 10 per cent of the Ryanair's 
scheduled European routes, the Irish airline said in Dublin.The Verdi spokeswoman also emphasized the support of 
local politicians, including Labour Minister Hubertus Heil, who met striking employees in Berlin.
"This support encourages employees," she said, while adding that even some travellers have shown interest and 
understanding at affected airports.

Ryanair cancelled flights yesterday due to a 24-hour walkout by pilots and cabin crew in Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Italy and Germany. A year after a rostering crisis that led the European budget carrier to recognise 
unions, it is still struggling with demands for better pay and conditions in large parts of its network. The industrial 
action has hit investor confidence in the company's leadership.
A growing investor protest led almost 30 per cent of shareholders to reject the re-election last week of David 
Bonderman, the US private equity tycoon who has chaired the airline for 22 years.
About 250 flights were cancelled, piling pressure on Michael O'Leary, chief executive, to make good on his promise 
to settle the disputes by Christmas.
The airline was hit by a wave of strikes during the summer, among them a walkout in five countries that led to the 
cancellation of 400 flights on August 10.
Passengers who were affected yesterday received text messages and emails from Ryanair. They can either apply 
for a refund or take another flight, but the carrier said it was not required to pay compensation under EU rules 
because the strikes were beyond its control.
Strike forces Ryanair to cancel 250 flights Airlines ; Chief under pressure after pledge to settle disputes by 
Christmas
The Dublin-based airline has entered into agreements with crew in Ireland, Italy and Britain, and has a recognition 
deal with one German union.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would not "roll over" in the face of industrial action, adding that pay increases would add 
(EURO)200m to annual costs.
Some unions have pushed for crew to be hired under local, rather that Irish, law. Mr O'Leary has said the company 
has lobbied Dublin to change the double taxation treaties that require it to employ crew under Irish law in line with 
its registration of aircraft.
At the same time, Ryanair blamed workers at rival airlines for stoking the disputes. In a complaint this week to the 
European Commission, Ryanair said its talks with staff in some countries were being impeded by a "collective 
campaign" involving the European Cockpit Association and the International Transport Workers' Federation.
Peter Bellow, Ryanair's chief operations officer, said yesterday that Germany's VC union, which had urged the 
German pilots to walk out, was "controlled" by Lufthansa, its competitor. Mr Bellow also said it had agreed to 
arbitration with the VC union over pay and conditions. "This is another example of a strike being organised in 
Ryanair by association, by a union controlled by competitor airline employees, despite the fact that Ryanair has 
agreed to arbitration," he said.
There were fresh demands from shareholders yesterday for the airline to get ahead of the disputes.

Ryanair's swagger used to be justified. The airline's reliability, low costs and the chutzpah of its leadership helped it 
become Europe's largest by passenger numbers. But it lost that crown in 2017.
Over the past year, the company's share price has dropped by a fifth, even though that of its rival easyJet rose by a 
tenth. Some of Ryanair's traditional strengths have started to look like sources of weakness.
Consider its tight lid on labour expenses. Yesterday, strikes disrupted 250 of its flights, in the latest wave of 
cancellations since a pilot rostering crisis blew up a year ago. Boss Michael O'Leary once said he would rather cut 
off his own hands than recognise a union. He relented last December but tensions continue to simmer.
There might be an upside to recognising unions. Doing so in France, for example, paved the way for an expansion 
unveiled this week.
But the shift of power to pilots is pushing up costs. Operating profit margins fell by 3 percentage points last year to 
22 per cent. Staff costs per employee were (EURO)5.30 per passenger in 2017 and are likely to rise to (EURO)7 by 
2020. With rising bills for fuel, profits are unlikely to increase over the next couple of years.
The staffing problems have put a spotlight on Ryanair's governance failings. Mr O'Leary's brash comments have 
inflamed disputes with workers. A more independent board would tell him to tone it down a bit. Chairman David 
Bonderman, in place for 22 years, was re-elected this month despite a shareholder protest. Investors need to be 
confident that the next chairman will stand up to the CEO.
Ryanair : lairy O'Leary
Ryanair is still a solid business. Its ample liquidity should allow it to weather the disruption caused by a disruptive 
Brexit. It thinks it has a good chance of reclaiming the title of Europe's largest airline this year, from Lufthansa. But 
some of the gloss has come off the model. A little humility would not go amiss.

MADRID (AP) - Thousands of travelers in Europe saw their plans disrupted Friday after airline Ryanair cancelled 
more than 200 flights because of strikes by cabin crew in Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany.
The budget airline says it had informed passengers of possible disruptions ahead of time, giving them time to 
adjust.
In Tenerife, Spain, hundreds of passengers queued at Ryanair counters and dozens more at the Madrid airport as 
86 flights of the low-cost company from or to Spain were cancelled, affecting some 16,000 passengers, according 
to Spanish unions.
The unions blame the Ireland-based company for breaking talks over the company's ratio of outsourced workers, 
working conditions and their demand for local contracts instead of Irish ones.
In a statement Thursday, the company blamed cabin crews of competitors for organizing the strikes and blocking 
"significant progress" in labor negotiations.
But the Brussels-based European Cabin Crew Association, which says it has more than 35,000 members, 
supported the walkout over what it described as the airline's "inflexibility, single-mindedness and unreasonable 
behavior."
The association alleged Ryanair was intimidating strikers by threatening them with job losses.
As the company and labor groups traded accusations, some passengers left on the ground by the cancellations 
were galled.
"They (Ryanair) sent me a text saying, 'Have a look at your email.' I don't have an email," said Eddie Hughes from 
Norfolk, England, at Madrid airport.
Spanish cabin crew workers' unions said cancelations could be increasing throughout the day. Airports in Valencia, 
Mallorca and Tenerife are the most affected, the unions said.
Thousands of travelers affected in Europe by Ryanair strike
In Portugal, 13 morning flights were canceled and in the Netherlands, 14 of 22 flights were cancelled.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.----------COMPANIES----------RSA Insurance Group reported 
its UK business suffered an underwriting loss for the third quarter of 2018. UK premiums are lower, RSA said, as it 
takes pricing and re-underwriting action, but international business, such as in Scandinavia and Canada, is more 
positive, it said. The UK made an underwriting loss of around GBP70 million during the third quarter, recording a 
110% combined ratio. A ratio over 100% represents underwriting losses. The company blamed increased weather, 
large losses, and attritional claims for the disappointing UK performance, with its Marine portfolio the worst hit. 
"RSA's international businesses performed well in the third quarter, making strong progress against our best-in-
class ambitions," said Chief Executive Stephen Hester, "However, our UK and 'London market' business reported 
an underwriting loss which is disappointing. 
Actions to improve in the UK are well underway and we are determined to restore satisfactory performance whilst 
continuing our progress internationally."----------easyJet expects to deliver a strong performance in final quarter of 
2018 financial year and profit for the year will be the upper at end of the company's guidance, partly helped by one-
off events such as the bankruptcies of rivals Monarch and Air Berlin and the flight cancellations suffered by Ryanair. 
easyJet expects headline pretax profit for the year to September-end to be between GBP570 million and GBP580 
million and revenue, including Berlin Tegel airport, to be around GBP5.89 billion. Passenger numbers for the 
financial year, excluding Tegel, are expected to increase by 5.4% to 84.6 million, driven by an expected increase in 
capacity of 4.2% to 90.3 million seats. The capacity was kept lower than originally planned due to the flight 
disruptions. Load factor for the full year is expected to increase by 1.0 percentage points to 93.6%. For 2019, the 
airliner predicts capacity to grow by 10% to around 105 million seats. Revenue per seat for the first half of the new 
financial year at constant currency is estimated to fall by the low to mid-single digits due to the absence of one-off 
revenue benefits recorded in the previous period.----------Striking staff have forced Ryanair Holdings to cancel 
around 250 flights on Friday, potentially affecting tens of thousands of passengers across Europe. A dispute over 
pay and conditions between the Irish budget airline and staff in six European countries will see them walk out for 24 
hours. Ryanair had cancelled 150 flights due to an "unnecessary" strike in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Portugal and Italy. On Thursday the airline said pilots in Germany would also be going on strike, with up to 100 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: RSA Insurance Suffers Storm-Tossed UK Underwriting
flights shelved as a result.---------United Utilities said trading in the first half of its financial year was in line with 
expectations but hot weather drove up costs. United Utilities said that in the six months to September its revenue 
was above the same period last year, reflecting regulatory revenue changes. The company incurred higher 
operating costs during the period, which the water and wastewater utility expects to record as an adjusted item. As 
such, underlying profit for the first half of its year is likely to exceed the previous year despite higher-than usual 
infrastructure renewals expenditure. Net group debt is expected to be slightly higher at September 30 than at March 
31. However, underlying net finance expense is likely to be around GBP30 million below its previous half year. 
United Utilities said it expects to invest a further GBP80 million to safeguard its water supplies. This includes 
GBP40 million in operating costs and infrastructure and GBP40 million in capital expenditure.----------Serco said 
trading in the first few months of the second half will result in a better outcome for 2018, one which will be 
"meaningfully ahead" of current market expectations. The outsourcing company said a strong operating 
performance along with several non-recurring trading items, such as end-of-contract settlements, and other 
commercial negotiations will contribute to the better than expected outcome. Serco is predicting underlying trading 
profit of GBP90 to GBP95 million on revenue of about GBP2.8 billion. Serco's previous guidance for revenue was 
GBP2.7 billion to GBP2.8 billion with underlying trading profit expected to be about GBP80 million. The FTSE 250-
listed company is also expecting its net debt to be towards the lower end of its range, GBP200 million to GBP250 
million, from having previously expected it to be at the mid-to-upper end.----------Peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle 
confirmed it has priced its initial public offering at 440 pence per share. On Wednesday last week, Funding Circle 
set a price range for the IPO between 420p and 530p, so the final price is near the bottom of that range. The 440p 
price will see the company raise gross proceeds of GBP300 million from 68.2 million new shares. Current 
shareholders also will sell 32.0 million existing shares, which will raise GBP141 million for them. Funding Circle 
expects unconditional dealings to start on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday next week, though 
conditional dealings began on Friday. The company will have a market capitalisation of around GBP1.50 billion, 
making it a candidate for the FTSE 250 index.----------MARKETS----------Stocks were mixed in London, with RSA 
Insurance the worst large-cap performer, down 9.6%. The pound was lower against the dollar after a report that the 
UK economy had its poorest half-year of growth for seven years. Wall Street was called for a lower open, having 
ended higher Thursday after positive economic data. ----------FTSE 100: 0.2% lower at 7,528.83FTSE 250: 0.1% 
lower at 20,347.72AIM ALL-SHARE: 0.4% higher at 1,100.59

GOLD: higher at USD1,184.42 per ounce (USD1,183.00)OIL (Brent): lower at USD81.71 a barrel (USD81.77)
(changes since previous London equities close)----------ECONOMICS AND GENERAL----------The UK economy has 
suffered its weakest six-month growth period since 2011, as the figure for the first quarter was revised lower. While 
the second reading for gross domestic product confirmed initial estimates of 0.4% growth in the second quarter 
from the quarter before, the Office for National Statistics said growth was weaker than originally thought in the first 
three months of the year. The ONS has revised quarter-on-quarter GDP growth down from 0.2% to 0.1% for the 
period from January to March this year &ndash; a period that saw the UK hit by extreme wintry weather brought in 
by the Beast from the East. The 0.4% quarter-on-quarter estimate for second quarter GDP was in line with 
economist estimates. The annual rise for the second quarter was revised down to 1.2% from 1.3%.----------UK 
consumer confidence weakened in September amid heightened uncertainty surrounding Brexit, survey data from 
GfK showed Friday. The consumer sentiment index dropped to -9 in September from -7 in August. The expected 
score was -8. Four sub-components of the index deteriorated in September and one stayed unchanged. The index 
measuring changes in past personal finances decreased three points to +1. Likewise, the forecast for personal 
finances over the coming 12 months dropped to +5 from +8 a month ago. The measure for the general economic 
situation during the last 12 months fell two points to -28, this was at the same level as September 2017, GfK said. 
Expectations for the general economic situation over the next 12 months edged down one point to -27. Meanwhile, 
the major purchase index stayed the same this month at +6.----------Boris Johnson has issued a blistering attack on 
Theresa May's Brexit strategy just days before the Conservative Party conference. The former foreign secretary, 
who sensationally quit the Cabinet in July, described the prime minister's Chequers plan as "a moral and intellectual 
humiliation for this country" that will "cheat the electorate" if implemented. Johnson, in a Telegraph op-ed, accused 
the government and civil service of a "pretty invertebrate performance" in negotiations and said there had been "a 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: RSA Insurance Suffers Storm-Tossed UK Underwriting
collapse of will by the British establishment to deliver on the mandate of the people". In a 4,500-word column, 
entitled "A better plan for Brexit", Johnson also set out an alternative vision which he says would make Britain "rich, 
strong and free". As a priority, the former London mayor urged the government to ditch Chequers and negotiate a 
Canada-style free deal which would "fulfil the instruction of the people".----------Eurozone inflation accelerated in 
September on food and energy prices, flash data from Eurostat showed. Inflation rose marginally to 2.1%, in line 
with expectations, from 2% a month ago. The European Central Bank targets "below, but close to 2%" inflation. 
Core inflation that excludes food, alcohol and tobacco, slowed unexpectedly to 0.9% from 1% in August. The core 
rate was expected to edge up to 1.1%. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices advanced 2.7% in September, following a 
2.4% rise in August. Likewise, the increase in energy cost increased to 9.5% from 9.2%. Non-energy industrial 
goods prices logged a steady growth of 0.4%. Similarly, services cost gained 1.3%, the same rate as seen in 
August.----------Italy will run a higher-than-expected deficit next year, after its economy minister, Giovanni Tria, 
surrendered Thursday to demands to fund expensive tax and welfare programmes via extra borrowing. Deputy 
Premiers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, who respectively lead the Five Star Movement and League parties, said 
a deal was struck "with all the government" to set the 2019 deficit at 2.4% of gross domestic product. "We are 
satisfied, this is a budget for change," they said in a joint statement. Tria, a technocrat with no formal political 
affiliation who was seen as a bulwark against reckless spending, wanted to limit the deficit to 1.6% of GDP, keeping 
Italy's huge public debt in check, as recommended by the EU. The country's public debt is equal to more than 130% 
of GDP, against a eurozone target of 60%. The decision to run a higher deficit is likely to result in a confrontation 
with EU authorities.----------Copyright 2018 Alliance News Limited. All Rights Reserved.

easyJet Upgrades Full-Year Trading Profit Guidance Amid Robust Demand for Flights
easyJet Upgrades Full-Year Trading Profit Guidance Amid Robust Demand 
for Flights

 Budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) said that its full-year 2018 pre-tax headline profit was expected to come in at the 
upper end of its previous guidance range early Friday because of "robust customer demand" and benefits accruing 
from rivals going bankrupt. 
Despite easyJet canceling more than 1,000 flights in June because of air traffic control strikes in France and Italy, 
the airline said in a trading statement that total revenue per seat at constant currency, excluding Tegel operations in 
Germany, for the second half is expected to rise by about 5.0%, which is the high end of previous guidance.
The company purchased Air Berlin's insolvent operations at the Tegel Airport in Berlin in late 2017, the same year 
in which the UK's Monarch Airlines collapsed and Ireland's Ryanair was hit by a rostering debacle that led to tens of 
thousands of flight cancellations.
Passenger numbers for the full year excluding Tegel are expected to jump by 5.4% to about 84.6 million, the 
company said, driven by an expected increase in capacity of 4.2% to roughly 90.3 million seats, which was lower 
than the carrier had originally planned due to the level of disruptions. Load factor for the full year is forecast to climb 
by 1.0 percentage points to 93.6%, it noted.
Given that easyJet's expected total loss from Tegel operations has now improved to be in line with its original 
guidance of about 160 million pounds and despite the air traffic control restrictions and severe weather across 
Europe, which pushed up easyJet's headline cost per seat, the UK budget airline forecast a pre-tax 2018 headline 
profit of between 570-580 million pounds. That compares with a previous estimate of 550-590 million pounds.
Looking ahead, easyJet said that its target is to break even in Berlin during fiscal 2019. easyJet is scheduled to 
publish its full-year 2018 results November 20.

Ryanair strikes set to hit over 40,000 passengers across Europe

Ryanair is bracing on Friday for another strike by staff as walkouts in six European countries, mainly cabin crew, 
force flight cancellations that will disrupt the plans of more than 40,000 travelers.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has faced a string of strikes since it recognized trade unions for the first time in 
December, damaging bookings and forcing it to consider cutting short-term growth plans if labor unrest continues.
Cabin crews in Germany, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, as well as pilots in Germany, served 
Ryanair strike notices of the 24-hour walkout, stepping up pressure in talks over pay and conditions.
Ryanair initially canceled 150 flights due to what it said was an unnecessary strike by a "tiny minority of cabin crew." 
The carrier said on Thursday it expected up to 100 more to be canceled after German pilots said they would join the 
protest.
The cancellations account for around 10% of its 2,400 scheduled flights on Friday.
The action in some of Ryanair's largest markets will be its second biggest one-day strike after some 55,000 
customers were affected in August when pilots in five European countries walked out at the height of the summer 
holiday season.
The Irish airline says it has made significant progress in recent weeks in negotiations, including reaching collective 
labor agreements with staff in Ireland, Britain, Italy and Germany.
Ryanair strikes set to hit over 40,000 passengers across Europe
"These strikes show that, despite its recent rhetoric, Ryanair has a long way to go before it enjoys sustainable 
industrial relations," Gabriel Mocho Rodriguez, civil aviation secretary at the International Transport Workers' 
Federation (ITF), said in a statement.
"You cannot claim negotiations are going well when workers in six countries on your network decide to take 
simultaneous strike action," he added. (Reuters)

 easyJet PLC on Friday said it expects to deliver a strong performance in final quarter of 2018 financial year and 
profit for the year will be the upper at end of the company's guidance, partly helped by one-off events such as the 
bankruptcies of rivals Monarch and Air Berlin and the flight cancellations suffered by Ryanair Holdings PLC.
The British low-cost carrier added, however, that disruption across Europe continues to be an industry wide issue 
and is having an impact on revenue, cost and operational performance, with the main causes being European 
industrial action and air traffic restrictions.
easyJet expects headline pretax profit for the year to September-end to be between GBP570 million and GBP580 
million and revenue, including Berlin Tegel airport, to be around GBP5.89 billion.
easyJet bought some assets from insolvent German airline Air Berlin in December last year, and commenced flights 
from Tegel in January.
Passenger numbers for the financial year, excluding Tegel, are expected to increase by 5.4% to 84.6 million, driven 
by an expected increase in capacity of 4.2% to 90.3 million seats. The capacity was kept lower than originally 
planned due to the flight disruptions. Load factor for the full year is expected to increase by 1.0 percentage points to 
93.6%.
Total headline cost, excluding fuel and including Tegel, is expected to be around GBP4.14 billion. easyJet's total 
fuel cost, including Tegel, for the financial year is expected to be around GBP1.19 billion, including an additional 
GBP15 million cost relating to dollar movement and carbon emissions costs.
easyjet, in addition, expects to record a GBP65 million exceptional charge relating to investments in improving its 
commercial technology platform
For 2019, the airliner predicts capacity to grow by 10% to around 105 million seats. Revenue per seat for the first 
half of the new financial year at constant currency is estimated to fall by the low to mid-single digits due to the 
absence of one-off revenue benefits recorded in the previous period.

easyJet's fuel bill for 2019 financial year is likely to increase by GBP55 million to GBP105 million, with the total bill 
expected to be around GBP1.48 billion. Forex movements are expected to dent adjusted pretax profit for the new 
year by GBP10 million.
easyJet intends to declare a full year dividend consistent with its stated policy of paying a dividend equivalent to 
50% of headline earnings per share. 
The company is slated to release its 2018 financial year results on November 20. Shares were trading 0.2% lower 
at 1,322.50 pence each.

Irish budget airline Ryanair faced new strike action coordinated by unions in six European countries on Friday, with 
at least 250 flights cancelled across the continent.
Ryanair pilots and cabin crew from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating 
in the walk-out, the second Europe-wide action to hit the company.
The airline and the unions provided starkly different figures for how many flights would be affected.
Ryanair apologized on Twitter to customers "affected by this unnecessary disruption," saying 90 per cent of flights 
were operating normally.
"Despite the regrettable and unjustified strike action taking place in six of our 37 markets today, all 400 of our first-
wave aircraft departed on schedule this morning," the airline said.
The Dublin-based budget carrier had earlier this week announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European 
flights for the day.
On Friday, it said more than 2,150 Ryanair flights would operate as normal, or about 90 per cent of its usual 
schedule, "carrying 400,000 customers across Europe."
"Ryanair took every step to minimize the disruption and we notified our customers as early as possible advising 
them of their free move, refund or reroute options," the airline said.
Some 133 flights to and from Germany were cancelled, according to a tally by the flights portal Airliners.de. This 
would represent about 40 per cent of Ryanair's total flights to and from the country.
Ryanair hampered by Europe-wide strike action
On Thursday, Ryanair gave the expected number of cancellations in Germany first as 35 to 45, and then as "less 
than 100," following a decision by Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) to participate in the strike.
An official from the German Verdi union gave considerably higher numbers, saying that some 250 flights would be 
struck off.
"This has been serious intimidation from the company, which has made it even more heartening that colleagues are 
taking part," said Verdi's Mira Neumaier.
A similar strike action in August led to some 400 flights being cancelled, including 150 in Germany.
Employees are striking for more pay and better conditions, in line with national law in various countries.
The company, long known for its opposition to the unionization of its workforce, has faced repeated strike action 
since the beginning of the year by pilots and cabin crew.

THE UK'S top share index rose yesterday to a four-week high, helped by a drop in sterling, while continued 
weakness in basic materials stocks weighed.
The FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent as the pound was held back by strength in the dollar following a US rate hike 
and investors remained nervous on the outcome of Brexit talks.
The index, whose companies make around 70 per cent of their total earnings from overseas, slightly outperformed 
the broader European market, which was weighed down by worries over Italy's budget.
Among the top FTSE gainers were tobacco group BAT, spirits maker Diageo and drug maker Shire, which all rose 
more than one per cent.
Oil and gas stocks rose as crude prices were pushed higher by the prospect of tighter markets due to US sanctions 
against major oil exporter Iran. Oil major BP was the biggest gainer in the sector, up 1.2 per cent, while Shell eased 
0.1 per cent. Airlines suffered from the strength in crude prices.
Easyjet fell 2.6 per cent, further hit by a price target cut from Kepler Cheuvreux. British Airways owner IAG fell 0.6 
per cent but Ryanair added 0.3 per cent.
Travel operator Tui rose 2.5 per cent after the company said it was on track to meet its forecasts for earnings 
growth, shrugging off the impact of a hot summer in its main customer markets. Tui rival Thomas Cook, which cut 
its profit forecast this week blaming a heatwave in Europe, gained 1.6 per cent.
Miners were broadly lower as copper prices fell further. The sector was the biggest weight to the FTSE yesterday.

 Striking workers of Ryanair (RYAAY) grounded plans in six European countries on Friday, Reuters reported, the 
impact of which has forced the company to consider cutting its short-term growth plans. 
Cabin crews in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain, as well as pilots in Germany, started 
a 24-hour walkout as airspace opened on Friday, disrupting the plans of over 40,000 passengers in the process.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has faced several strikes since it started recognizing trade unions in 
December, with staff stepping up pressure in talks concerning pay and working conditions.
"They don't care about us. We are just numbers. We are lemons to be squeezed and thrown away," said Juan 
Fernandez, an ex-employee of Ryanair who joined protesters at Brussels airport.

Irish budget airline Ryanair is to see strikes coordinated by unions in six European countries on Friday, set to wipe 
out almost 200 flights across the continent.
Ryanair employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating in the walk-
out, the second pan-European action to hit the company.
The Dublin-based budget carrier had earlier announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European flights for the 
day.
But on Thursday, Ryanair marketing head Kenny Jacobs said the decision by Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) 
to participate would result in 35 to 45 flights to and from Germany not taking off, raising the total number of 
cancellations.
Employees are striking for more pay and better conditions, in line with national law in various countries.
The company, long known for its opposition to the unionization of its workforce, has faced repeated strike action 
since the beginning of the year by pilots and cabin crew.
A similar wave of strikes in August led to the cancellation of 400 flights throughout Europe.

RYANAIR said yesterday it would invest $400m (£305m) on establishing hubs for its planes at two French airports, 
returning to heavily unionised France after the airline's decision to recognise unions.
The budget airline, which closed its last hub in France in 2011, has faced several months of strikes as a result of its 
decision in December to recognise unions. Pilots and cabin crew in Germany are the latest to step up pressure over 
pay and conditions.
German unions representing both said their members would strike today, joining crews in Belgium, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, and bringing the total number of flights cancelled to almost 250.

Ryanair pilots in Germany will join colleagues on strike in several European countries on Friday, the German pilots' 
union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said late on Wednesday, stepping up pressure in a dispute over pay and 
conditions.
The European Union executive has also thrown its weight behind workers at the low-cost airline, saying that they 
should work under contracts in the countries where they live rather than in Ireland where its planes are registered.
"No improved offer has been made to VC since the last industrial action on 12 September 2018. In addition, no 
conciliation agreement has been reached between Ryanair and VC so far," German union VC said in a statement.
It called on Ryanair pilots in Germany to stage a strike from 3.01 am local time (0101 GMT) on Friday to 2.59 am on 
Saturday.
Ryanair has already cancelled 150 flights on Friday due to the latest strike action by cabin crews in Belgium, 
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
Germany's services union Verdi, which represents around 1,000 cabin crew at Ryanair, also planned to hold rallies 
on Friday over pay and conditions.
The union has said it would decide whether to call for walkouts as well on Thursday evening.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has traditionally employed a significant proportion of its staff under Irish 
law, which unions say inconveniences staff and impedes them from accessing local social security benefits.

Ryanair announced the cancellation of additional flights to and from Germany for Friday, in addition to other 
Europe-wide cancellations caused by pilots striking.
The decision by Germany's Cockpit pilot's union (VC) to participate in the strike will result in 35 to 45 flights to and 
from Germany not taking off, Ryanair marketing head Kenny Jacobs said in Dublin on Thursday.
The cancelled flights make up some 10 per cent of the Germany schedule. The Dublin-based budget carrier earlier 
announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European flights for the day.
Jacobs indicated that Ryanair believed that German union Verdi, representing cabin crew, would also participate in 
the strike. Verdi is set to make an announcement later in the day.
Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew noted that several workers' rallies were planned.
Ryanair employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating in the 
strike, the second pan-European action to hit the company.
Ryanair has laid a complaint with European Union competition authorities alleging that its competitor companies are 
behind the coordinated action.
The company expressed disappointment that Germany's VC was joining the strike, noting progress made in talks 
with VC on Tuesday, including the appointment of a German mediator.
Bellew said Ryanair was keen to strike a deal within six weeks, with a view to concluding conditions and pay 
contracts by the end of the year.

On Tuesday, the airline said it had signed a new contract with its cabin crew in Italy that will begin on October 1 and

A man in his 20s was arrested on Thursday after running onto a runway in an effort to catch his flight from Dublin 
Airport.
The late passenger, Patrick Kehoe, ran across a runway in a bid to stop the Ryanair flight to Amsterdam early 
Thursday morning, Irish national broadcaster RTE and other media reported.
He had forced his way through the boarding gate and broken a door lock to access the runway, the reports said.
Kehoe ran towards the plane "with his suitcase under his arm," RTE quoted a witness as saying.
The BBC quoted an airport spokesman as saying Kehoe and a woman accompanying him had arrived late at the 
boarding gate, after the flight had closed.
"They were engaging with Ryanair staff at the gate and the male passenger was becoming agitated," the 
spokesman said.
"He was banging on the window to try and get the aircraft to wait... and made his way onto the apron, trying to flag 
the aircraft down."
The man's brash behaviour continued after an appearance in Dublin District Court later Thursday to answer a 
charge of criminal damage, when he lowered his trousers to reveal his buttocks to press photographers, according 
to RTE. He was bailed to appear again on November 8.

Ratings agency Moody's has warned that the UK's withdrawal from the European Union without a deal would be a 
"significantly credit-negative" event for European airlines.
In a newly published report, the agency forecasts that a no-deal outcome would have "severe" short-term financial 
implications for European carriers.
This risk becomes more "modest" in the long term, as time should allow for comprehensive agreements to be 
reached and airlines to adjust their operations.
Moody's identifies five main risks to EU airlines from a no-deal outcome.
One is the risk that traffic rights between the UK and the European Common Aviation Area could be lost.
Likewise, traffic rights between the UK and other third countries that have aviation agreements with the EU, 
including the USA, are at risk.
Further risk arises from the need to meet ownership and control conditions in order to retain valid operating 
licences.
Additionally, a question mark hangs over the UK's continued membership in the European Aviation Safety Agency 
and certifying compliance with internationally recognised safety requirements.
Finally, there is the risk of weaker macroeconomic conditions.
Moody's warns of airline credit risk in event of no-deal Brexit Ratings agency Moody's has warned that the UK's 
withdrawal from the European Union without a dea....
The report's author Jeanine Arnold – a Moody's vice-president and senior credit officer – says a no-deal scenario 
could interfere with an airline's ability to increase yields, raise load factors and generate cost efficiencies. 
"Ultimately, it could lead to cash-flow and liquidity pressures," she notes.
British Airways, EasyJet, Ryanair, Thomas Cook, TUI and Virgin Atlantic are identified in the report as being some 
of the "most exposed" carriers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
It points out that the "strong liquidity" of BA, EasyJet and Ryanair should enable them to weather the financial 
impact of a no-deal Brexit, even if flights are disrupted for an extended period. However, for airlines negatively 
affected by a no-deal Brexit, a sustained deterioration in liquidity and key credit metrics such as "gross leverage" or 
cash-flow coverage could lead to negative rating actions, the Moody's report warns.
"Broadly, an airline will be less exposed if it has a more flexible operating model and cost structure, greater network 
diversification and scale, and has begun to implement contingency measures," it states.
Moody's says Norwegian is less exposed to the risks it has identified, but believes the Scandinavian airline's "very 
weak liquidity" leaves it more sensitive to flight disruption or macroeconomic factors.
Responding to the Moody's note, Norwegian says it "continues to fly an increasing number of passengers and 
generate more revenue than ever" as it focuses on "building a strong, sustainable and global business".
The airline is "continuously monitoring the situation and evaluating steps to mitigate any risk to our operation from 
Brexit", it adds. "Structurally, Norwegian is well-positioned to protect our flying rights both in Europe and the UK, 
including in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit."
Noting that a "positive agreement" is "clearly in the common economic interests of the EU and the UK", Norwegian 
expresses confidence that one will be reached, "ensuring continued access to affordable air travel for citizens of 
both parties".

       By dpa correspondents   Frankfurt/DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - German cabin crew are being urged to join a day-long 
strike targeting Ryanair flights, trade union Verdi said on Thursday.  It called on some 1,000 Ryanair staff to join 
pilots on a countrywide strike on Friday in support of higher pay and better working conditions at the Dublin-based 
budget carrier.  'Europe's largest low-cost airline refuses to grant its employees a decent income and a corporate

German cabin crew are being urged to join a day-long strike targeting Ryanair flights, trade union Verdi said on 
Thursday.
It called on some 1,000 Ryanair staff to join pilots on a countrywide strike on Friday in support of higher pay and 
better working conditions at the Dublin-based budget carrier.
"Europe's largest low-cost airline refuses to grant its employees a decent income and a corporate culture free of 
fear as before," Verdi executive Christine Behle said in Berlin.
Several unions across the European Union have called for a strike to halt Ryanair flights. Almost 200 flights have 
been cancelled as a result.
The company, long known for its opposition to the unionization of its workforce, has faced repeated strike action 
since the beginning of the year by pilots and cabin crew.
Employees are striking for more pay and better conditions, in line with national law in various countries.
Earlier Thursday, Ryanair marketing head Kenny Jacobs said in Dublin the decision by Germany's Cockpit pilot's 
union (VC) to participate would result in 35 to 45 flights to and from Germany not taking off.
The cancelled flights make up some 10 per cent of the Germany schedule. The Dublin-based budget carrier earlier 
announced the cancellation of 150 out of 2,400 European flights for the day.
Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew noted that several workers' rallies were planned.
German cabin crew urged to join Ryanair strike amid cancellations
Ryanair employees from Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany are participating in the 
strike, the second pan-European action to hit the company.
Ryanair has laid a complaint with EU competition authorities alleging that its competitors are behind the coordinated 
action.
The company expressed disappointment that Germany's VC was joining the strike, noting progress made in talks 
with VC on Tuesday, including the appointment of a German mediator.
Bellew said Ryanair was keen to strike a deal within six weeks, with a view to concluding conditions and pay 
contracts by the end of the year.
On Tuesday, the airline said it had signed a new contract with its cabin crew in Italy that will begin on October 1 and 
run for three years.
In Belgium meanwhile, the CNE trade union accused Ryanair of acting "irresponsibly" by failing to cancel enough 
flights on Friday.
Ryanair's behaviour "could create tensions and insecurity for all staff at the airport, at Ryanair and for the 
passengers concerned," the union said in a statement.
Conditions could be particularly bad at Charleroi, Belgium's main airport for low-cost carriers, where 20,000 airline 
passengers could be expected on Friday, CNE said, warning of potential "chaos."
The European Consumer Organization, BEUC, warned that the strikes could leave many passengers without 
compensation.
"We call on Ryanair to compensate consumers caught up in the latest wave of mass cancellations according to EU 
passenger rights rules," said Monique Goyens of BEUC, arguing that many passengers had no "realistic option to 
defend their rights."

LONDON (AP) - An Irish man who missed his flight at Dublin Airport was arrested Thursday for running after the 
plane on the tarmac in a bid to flag it down.
Witnesses said a man in his 20s broke through an airport door and ran toward the Ryanair plane, which was about 
to take off for Amsterdam, at around 7 a.m.
Declan Harvey, who was at the airport, said he could hear a man shouting "Wait!" at the plane before he was 
tackled to the ground by airport workers.
The airport said that a man became "agitated" after he and a woman arrived at the gate too late for their flight. It 
said the man "broke through a door and made his way onto the apron, trying to flag the aircraft down."
He was briefly restrained by Ryanair staff until airport police arrived. He was handed over to Irish police and taken 
to a Dublin police station.
Patrick Kehoe, 23, later appeared in a Dublin court charged with criminal damage to a door lock. He was granted 
bail until a court appearance in November.
Se he left court, Kehoe shouted abuse and insults at journalists and swung at them with his suitcase, before 
lowering his trousers and mooning bystanders.

European Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen told Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary on Wednesday that 
the Irish airline must respect EU rules and give workers contracts according to where they live.
The Belgian commissioner told the Ryanair chief executive that EU rules on employment for mobile air crews were 
clear - based not on the flag of the aircraft, but the place where workers left in the morning and returned in the 
evening.
"Respecting the law is not something over which workers should have to negotiate and not something that can be 
postponed to a later date," Thyssen said in a statement.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has said it plans to cancel 150 flights on Friday due to a strike over 
working conditions by cabin crews in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
O'Leary said he and Thyssen had discussed local contracts during their meeting, "and the fact that we have offered 
them already," he added.
Ryanair employs staff across Europe under Irish contracts, but some unions want the ability to negotiate terms 
under the employment laws of their own country.
For Belgium, the airline has agreed to follow local employment law from March 2020. Belgian union CNE said this 
change would only affect about half of its workers. (Reuters)

       BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The European Commission warned Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary on 
Wednesday that the airline must comply with EU rules, as cabin crew members gear up for a mass strike on Friday 
to demand better work conditions.   EU Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen and O'Leary had a 'frank 
and open discussion' about employment conditions at Ryanair and the current social tensions, commission 
spokesman Margaritis Schinas said. Wednesday's meeting had taken place at O'Leary's request. 
  Thyssen called upon O'Leary to 'ensure full compliance with all applicable EU rules and legislation, as it is the 
case for all EU airline companies,' Schinas added.    'Respecting EU law is not something over which workers 
should have to negotiate, nor is it something which can be done differently from country to country. I made this very 
clear to Mr O'Leary today,' Thyssen said in a statement.  'I am not against Ryanair or against the low-cost business 
model. But with great success also comes great responsibility,' she added.   Staff across Europe have long been at 
loggerheads with Ryanair due to its practice of employing them under Irish labour law. Trade unions in Belgium, 
Italy, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands argue that they would receive better conditions under their domestic 
laws.  Ryanair cancelled 150 European flights scheduled for this Friday due to the planned strike, which is the latest 
in a series of industrial actions.   It had originally expected 190 cancellations but issued an updated figure on 
Wednesday.   The airline argues that the strike is 'unnecessary' since it has improved its offer in recent weeks to 
pilots and cabin crews in Ireland, Britain, Italy and Germany.   Copyright dpa

Ryanair may cut planned capacity growth due to strikes

Ryanair will consider cutting its capacity growth plans for this winter and next summer if staff strikes continue, a 
senior executive said on Tuesday after announcing that 30,000 passengers will be impacted by a cabin crew strike 
on Friday.
"These repeated unnecessary strikes are damaging Ryanair’s business and our customer confidence at a time 
when oil prices are rising strongly, and if they continue, it is inevitable that we will have to look again at our capacity 
growth this winter and in summer 2019," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement.
A Belgian trade union warned on Tuesday that Ryanair is "playing with fire" in its handling of a planned cabin crew 
strike across five countries on Sept. 28, by not warning passengers about possible disruptions to flight schedules.
The company is continuing to sell tickets for flights on Friday and is not responding to queries from customers about 
the status of their flights on that day, the Belgian cabin crew union CNE said in a statement.
"This situation is totally irresponsible," the union said. Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment.
Cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands are planning a 24-hour strike on Sept. 28 
over Ryanair's labor agreements. They plan to strike once a month until their demands are met.
Some pilots' associations are also planning to join the strike.
Ryanair may cut planned capacity growth due to strikes
The Belgian cabin crew union predicted that the strike would be the biggest ever seen in Europe and cause the 
cancellation of about 80 percent of flights from Charleroi Airport and probably all of the airline's flights from Brussels 
Airport.
Earlier in September, Ryanair rejected claims by the unions that the strike would cause "travel chaos" and said the 
airline would warn affected customers of a small number of flight cancellations.
During a walkout by pilots and crew earlier this month, the airline was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 German 
flights.
Customers on Twitter have asked the Irish airline about the status of their flights on Sept. 28. Ryanair has 
responded to some that it expects "the vast majority of cabin crew to work as normal on Sept. 28, as they have 
during previous strikes" and that "all fights are scheduled to operate." (Reuters)

       BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair has cancelled 190 European flights on Friday due to planned strikes by cabin 
crew in Spain, Belgium, The Netherlands, Portugal, Italy and Germany, the budget airline said on Tuesday.  In a 
statement, Ryanair described the strike action as 'unnecessary,' adding: 'Ryanair has made significant progress in 
recent weeks with our union negotiations, which include pilot and/or cabin crew agreements in Ireland, UK, Italy and 
Germany.' 
 Strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew across Europe had already resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of 
flights this summer.  Ryanair's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs said: 'We hope these unions will see common sense 
and work with us to finalize agreements for the benefit of our pilots and cabin crew over the coming weeks without 
further disrupting our customers or our flights.'  Also on Tuesday, the airline said it had signed a new contract with 
its cabin crew in Italy.  The contract will begin on October 1 and run for three years, Ryanair said. It includes an 
increase in wages under a new compensation structure.  Ryanair agreed the terms of the contract in mid-
September with the FIT CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV unions.   However, other Italian trade unions that did not 
participate in the negotiations criticized the contract and called for an emergency meeting on Tuesday with Labour 
Minister Luigi Di Maio.  Members of the Italian unions that rejected the deal were planning to take part in the strike 
action on September 28.   Copyright dpa

Fatigue cracking behind Ryanair nosegear failure

UK investigators have determined that a fatigue crack in the nosegear axle of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 caused 
one of the wheels to detach on take-off from London Stansted.
The left axle of the inner cylinder failed as the jet (EI-DLV) turned onto runway 22 in preparation for a departure to 
Copenhagen on 15 September last year. It diverted to East Midlands airport.
Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) analysis found that the axle journal, while being overhauled, had 
sustained a re-tempering burn during post-chrome plate grinding.
This would have resulted in heat-induced cracking in the base metal, it states, which “probably” grew through 
hydrogen embrittlement cracking during cadmium plating.
Visual inspections did not detect the presence of any cracks in the chrome surface – which, in any case, would 
have been microscopic – and there was no requirement to conduct an inspection with fluorescent dye.
“Because no cracks were detected, the part was returned to service,” says the inquiry. “Over time, in-service axle 
flexure caused fatigue cracks to initiate from the hydrogen embrittlement region, and propagate through the wall of 
the axle.”
It states that, while the cause of the original grinding burns could not be determined, there was “no effective 
mechanism” for detecting them.
The cylinder involved had previously been installed on a different 737-800 and had accumulated nearly 22,100 
cycles since new.
It had been overhauled in December 2014 at just over 17,000 cycles before being fitted on the aircraft involved in 
the incident.

If the publication of the UK government's latest Brexit aviation technical notices gave airlines clarity on anything, it is 
that they face the prospect of a mountain of red tape and are at risk of being hostages to the two sides' goodwill in 
the event of a no-deal outcome.
While the Department for Transport (DfT) is at pains to emphasise that the prospect of a no-deal scenario remains 
"unlikely", its 24 September notices – which cover flight operations, safety and security – paint a picture of a 
regulatory maze post-March 2019, in which airlines from both the UK and the EU would be forced to not only 
revalidate many of the certificates they already hold but to navigate new layers of bureaucracy to enjoy today's 
freedoms.
The notice concerning flights to and from the UK highlights that in the event of a no-deal outcome, UK- and EU-
licensed airlines would lose their automatic right to operate air services to one another's jurisdictions and would 
require individual permissions to do so.
The DfT says the UK would envisage granting the EU airlines' permission to continue operating in such a scenario 
and "would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn".
Significantly, the DfT explicitly acknowledges that in the event of these permissions' not being granted, flight 
disruption between the EU and UK could occur. Such an admission bears out the warnings of Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary, who, since the Brexit referendum , has repeatedly highlighted the risk that aircraft would 
be grounded after March if no deal were secured.
ANALYSIS: No-deal Brexit promises only red tape for airlines If the publication of the UK government's latest 
Brexit aviation technical notices gave airlines cl....
The tone is quite different from comments by UK transport secretary Chris Grayling, who in October 2017 described 
it as "inconceivable" that airlines could be prevented from flying between the EU and the UK if no agreement were 
reached by March 2019.
Another theme that runs through the notice is the requirement for reciprocity and goodwill. The DfT says that in a 
no-deal scenario, EU airlines would be required to hold a foreign carrier permit as well as a safety authorisation 
from the UK Civil Aviation Authority called a "UK Part-TCO (Third Country Operator)".
The government says the CAA will consider each application for a UK Part-TCO on a case-by-case basis, but in 
principle an airline that holds a valid European Aviation Safety Agency air operator's certificate will be considered to 
have "met the qualifying requirements". The government says it would expect this recognition of equivalent safety 
standards to be reciprocated by the EU in its granting of Part-TCO authorisations to UK carriers.
UK-licensed airlines will require foreign carrier permits for the countries they wish to operate into, and will need an 
EU Part-TCO issued by EASA. The DfT points out that EASA has yet to detail how the process for obtaining this 
would work, but again the government would "expect" the EU to recognise UK safety standards on a reciprocal 
basis.
In order to ensure permissions are granted and flights continue, the DfT says its preference would be to agree a 
basic arrangement or understanding on a multilateral basis between the UK and the EU.
Alternatively, bilateral arrangements between the UK and an individual EU country could be put in place, specifying 
the conditions under which air services would be permitted. By definition any such agreement would be "reciprocal 
in nature", it states. It points out that the European Commission has indicated that a bare-bones agreement on air 
services would be "desirable in the event of the UK leaving with no deal".
In the event of no deal, the DfT acknowledges that UK airlines will lose the ability to operate intra-European routes, 
and EU carriers will similarly lose their ability to fly domestic routes within the UK.
As far as operating licences are concerned, the DfT says all licences issued before exit would remain in place and 
that the UK has no plans to impose new nationality restrictions on the conditions of an operating licence. It makes 
no mention of how the EU might approach the issuing of operating licences to UK airlines.
EU-registered airlines with "significant investment from or ownership by UK nationals" will need to consider how 
they square this with EU rules' requirement that they be majority owned and controlled by European nationals.
In a reaction to the notices, IATA director general Alexandrew de Juniac warns that they illustrate the "huge amount 
of work" that will be required to maintain vital air links.
Securing mutual recognition of existing standards is a process that "cannot happen overnight", he cautions, adding 
that that even when the task is completed, airlines and governments will face an "administrative burden" that will 
take time and significant resources.
"While we still hope for a comprehensive EU-UK deal, an assumption that 'it will be all right on the night' is far too 
risky to accept. Every contingency should be prepared for, and we call upon both the EU and the UK to be far more 
transparent with the state of the discussions," he says.
UK trade organisation ADS says the notices illustrate the risk of "delay or cancellation" of flights between the UK 
and EU over disruption to safety certifications. It says the best outcome to avoid this would be the UK's remaining a 
member of EASA – something that UK prime minister Theresa May has previously said the nation will strive 
towards.
The notices illustrate that the UK is seeking to put in place as frictionless an aviation regulatory regime for 
European airlines as possible, even in the event of a no-deal outcome with the EU, but on the condition that the EU 
does the same.
ANALYSIS: No-deal Brexit promises only red tape for airlines If the publication of the UK government's latest 
Brexit aviation technical notices gave airlines cl....
Such a negotiating strategy – that of assuming the opposing side will look on your proposals in a favourable light 
and therefore reciprocate – is inherently risky, as illustrated by the cold reception with which May's Chequers plan 
was met by EU leaders in Salzburg earlier this year.
Thorny issues such as the status of EU nationals in the UK after 2019, the future regulation of the Northern Irish 
border and access to the single market – major roadblocks in the wider EU-UK Brexit negotiations – may be absent 
from the talks on future aviation relations between the two sides, but airlines can take little comfort from the no-deal 
notices.

LONDON (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair has cancelled 190 flights scheduled for Friday because of strikes by cabin 
crew in Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany.
The flights represent some 8 percent of the 2,400 originally scheduled. The airline said in a statement Tuesday that 
all affected customers have received emails or text messages informing them of the cancellation.
Some 30,000 customers are likely to be affected out of 450,000 set to travel.
Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs has apologized to customers affected by strikes "which we have done our utmost to avoid."
Ryanair canceled hundreds of flights last year due to problems with pilot scheduling, and strikes have led to more 
cancellations this summer. The budget airline and pilots have wrangled over working conditions, base transfers and 
annual leave.

UK Government Warns Of Travel Disruption After A No-Deal Brexit
UK Government Warns Of Travel Disruption After A No-Deal Brexit

 Passengers could face flight disruption as well as bus & coach services to EU countries being suspended in the 
event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK government has warned. 
If the UK withdraws from the EU without an agreement then airlines will have to obtain individual permissions to 
operate between the UK and the EU, according to new guidance.
The warning was contained in a tranche of 24 technical papers released by government departments on Monday 
advising businesses and consumers on potential impacts of a no-deal Brexit.
The document states that the UK "would envisage" allowing EU airlines to continue flying and "we would expect EU 
countries to reciprocate in turn", according to the document.
It added: "It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could 
be served, though if such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights."
Bus and coach services could also be suspended in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
UK coach operators have been advised to consider subcontracting "all or part of the coach travel" on the continent 
to EU-based operators as no deal would mean operators could no longer rely on automatic recognition by the EU of 
UK-issued community licences.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has repeatedly warned that flights could be grounded if an aviation deal is not 
reached as part of the Brexit negotiations.
The government insists a no-deal Brexit "remains unlikely given the mutual interests of the UK and the EU".
Luton-based carrier easyJet created an Austrian division in July 2017 to allow it to fly between EU countries after 
Brexit.
UK Government Warns Of Travel Disruption After A No-Deal Brexit
Flights between the UK and 17 non-EU countries, such as the US, Canada, Switzerland and Iceland, currently 
operate due to the UK being a member of the EU.
The guidance states that "replacement arrangements will be in place before exit day".
The UK has already reached agreements with a number of these countries and is "confident the remaining 
agreements will be agreed well in advance of the UK leaving the EU".
The notice for coach operators says ministers are seeking to negotiate continued membership of the Interbus 
Agreement, which would allow occasional services for the likes of holiday operators, but this "cannot be 
guaranteed".
The paper says: "The government considers the likelihood of failing to achieve UK membership of Interbus by 
March 29 2019, or very soon thereafter, to be low. But if this occurs for any reason, it would be likely that no UK 
operators would be able to take coach services into the EU at least in the short term.
"UK operators who are taking travel bookings which involve coach travel in Europe after March 29 2019 may wish 
to consider contractual terms with their customers that allow them to subcontract all or part of the coach travel to 
EU-based operators if necessary."
The technical notice says the UK will permit EU buses and coaches to continue bringing passengers into and out of 
the UK to minimise any potential disruption to passengers.
"This will ensure, for example, that EU tourists and students would not be stopped from visiting the UK if there is 
any delay to joining the Interbus Agreement."
Operators are also warned there are likely to be new requirements at borders with the EU in the event of no deal, 
and there could be impacts for coaches using EU ports.
The paper says: "In the event of delays, caused by increased checks at EU ports, the UK Government would 
implement contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic."
The notice says further communications will be issued later in the autumn.

Frustrated Ryanair investors target chairman after year of strikes
Frustrated Ryanair investors target chairman after year of strikes

A significant minority of Ryanair shareholders voted against the re-election of the airline's long-serving chairman on 
Thursday but they overwhelmingly rejected calls by trade unions to oppose Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
The votes at the company's annual meeting were the first chance for investors to give their verdict on a series of 
strikes and a year of management mis-steps that have seen the share price fall 17%.
After a number of shareholders in the lead up to the vote publicly called for Chairman David Bonderman, 75, to step 
down, he was re-elected with 70.5% of votes, a significant fall from the 89% he received last year. Bonderman has 
chaired the company since 1996.
But they reaffirmed their support for O'Leary, who has pursued a tough line with trade unions, with 98.5% re-
electing him to the board, down from 99% last year.
O'Leary, 57, said he would now negotiate a new contract to take him beyond 2019, but was reluctant to get tied into 
a five-year contract at his age.
"The overwhelming majority of our shareholders are supportive [of chairman David Bonderman] ... and we should 
be very appreciative," O'Leary, who became chief executive in 1994, told the meeting.
Ryanair has struggled with labour relations in recent months and endured its worst one-day strike last month, 
disrupting the plans of an estimated 55,000 travelers.
Another one-day strike by cabin crew is planned across five countries on Sept. 28.
Frustrated Ryanair investors target chairman after year of strikes
Ahead of the meeting a number of institutional investors, including Royal London Asset Management and Britain's 
Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), had announced publicly that they would oppose Bonderman's re-
election.
"We hope Mr Bonderman and the board will heed the message shareholders have sent today and announce plans 
for him to step down," said Ian Greenwood, chairman of the LAPFF said after the vote.
"Ryanair should recruit an independent chairman who will strengthen the board to provide greater oversight and 
challenge to Mr O'Leary," he added.
Speaking to journalists, Bonderman, 75, declined to speculate on when he might leave, but said he thought criticism 
of the board in recent months had been "way off base."
Bonderman, the founder of private equity firm TPG Capital resigned from the board of Uber in 2017 after an ill-
judged joke that more women on the board means "more talking".
Ahead of the meeting, a number of trade unions issued statements calling for shareholders to oppose the re-
election of both Bonderman and O'Leary.
"While he (O'Leary) is still there as the embodiment of Ryanair's values, the distrust among many staff is likely to 
continue and with it the industrial unrest," BALPA pilots' union General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.
"If this opportunity is missed, it is difficult to envisage how Ryanair can move forward."
While O'Leary said he did not expect many strikes over the winter, he declined to speculate when asked more than 
once if the industrial action could escalate.
After the meeting, he told journalists he had been asked by the company's remuneration committee to extend his 
contract but that he did not want to commit to a new five-year deal.
Instead, he said would rather move to a rolling 12-month contract at some point in the next few years. He has a 
stake in the company of just over four percent according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
Ryanair had initially banned media from the meeting, prompting some to buy shares and others to stay overnight at 
the meeting venue north of Dublin. At the last minute management decided to allow journalists to attend. (Reuters)

RYANAIR'S under-fire chairman David Bonderman faced opposition from nearly 30 per cent of investors, who voted 
to block his re-election to the airline's board at its tense annual meeting (AGM) yesterday.
Other board members that faced opposition were Kyran McLaughlin, who received 66.8 per cent of the vote, 
Howard Millar; who took 78.5 per cent, and Michael Cawley - boss Michael O'Leary's former deputy chief executive 
and current chief financial officer. O'Leary himself won the backing of 98.5 per cent of investors.
"The overwhelming majority of our shareholders are supportive [of Bonderman]... and we should be very 
appreciative," O'Leary said.
O'Leary added that instead of seeking a five-year contract he would prefer a 12-month rolling contract because of 
his age.
Bonderman, who stepped down from the board of Uber for making derogatory remarks about women, faced 
opposition from a number of investors including asset manager Royal London, the Local Authority Pension Fund 
(LAPFF) and the International Transport Workers' Federation. The investors said his long tenure had made him 
unable to provide independent advice to O'Leary, at a time when the airline was under the grip of industrial action 
over labour contracts.
Yesterday, Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds 11m shares in Ryanair, warned it would not back 
Bonderman or McLaughlin again.
Ryanair AGM blemished by investor revolt
"The length of time both have been on the board suggests a lack of focus on board succession planning; excessive 
tenure also calls into question an individual's independence and objectivity," said investment director Alison 
Kennedy, adding that she wanted to see "clear progress on succession" by next year.
Ian Greenwood, LAPFF's chair, said: "We hope Mr Bonderman and the board will heed the message shareholders 
have sent today and announce plans for him to step down. Ryanair should recruit an independent chairman who 
will strengthen the board to provide greater oversight and challenge to Mr O'Leary."

Ryanair has rejected investor pressure for the departure of its long-serving chairman David Bonderman after a 
significant shareholder protest.
Mr Bonderman, chairman for 22 years, was re-elected to the board with support of 70.5 per cent of shareholders at 
the company's annual meeting.
But that left a sizeable number of investors who failed to back him with some openly calling for a clear succession 
plan.
Alison Kennedy, of Aberdeen Standard Investments, which has a 0.9 per cent stake in the business, read a 
statement to the annual meeting in which she urged a plan be put in place to select his successor.
The lack of a plan "suggests a lack of focus on succession planning and suggests the board is not listening closely 
enough to shareholders", she said.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the "overwhelming" level of support for Mr Bonderman's re-election would 
make a politician happy. Still, he doubted whether the chairman would stay for another two years.
"He knows it won't go on forever. We know it won't go on forever," Mr O'Leary told reporters after the meeting.

"But frankly if we could encourage him to continue to chair the company for another couple of years, I personally 
would encourage him to do so. I don't think he will."
Kieran McLoughlin, senior independent director and a member of the board for 17 years, said the board had 
changed over the years. "There are plans for rotation. There are plans for renewal," he said. "It hasn't been the 
same board over the last 20 years."
Mr O'Leary, who has faced demands from pilot unions to stand down, said he had accepted an invitation to enter 
talks on a new contract when his current one expires next year.
The process would be "subject to extensive and what will undoubtedly be painful negotiations with Mrs O'Leary", he 
said in a playful reference to his wife.
Mr O'Leary, whose 4 per cent stake in Ryanair is worth (EURO)316m, said he would be happy to move to a rolling 
12-month deal from his current five-year contract.
"I'm not sure whether I want to sign up for another five years. That would take me to 62," he said.
"The board suggests I should sign up for a longer period. It's not going to be a difficult conversation ... I'm happy to 
stay for another couple of years."
He said pay increases for cabin crew would add (EURO)200m to Ryanair's annual costs, while the airline's fuel 
costs would be (EURO)400m higher this year. He expressed confidence after industrial unrest this summer that the 
company would settle all pay talks by Christmas.

Stobart Group's Aviation Unit Flying High But New Revenue Recognition Method to Hit Rails Business
Stobart Group's Aviation Unit Flying High But New Revenue Recognition 
Method to Hit Rails Business

 Stobart Group (STOB.L), a British aviation, energy and rail company, reported early Thursday a surge in 
passenger numbers at its London Southend Airport, but warned a change in its revenue recognition method would 
hurt the full-year results of the rails business.  
In a pre-close trading update for the six months that ended Aug. 31, the company said passenger traffic soared by 
37% year-on-year because of an improved awareness of the airport from branding and marketing, route 
development, and airline incentive deals.
"The introduction of Ryanair (RYAAY) flights in spring 2019 is the next step in the growth of our London airport," the 
company said in the update. "This significant long-term partnership agreement is expected to result in at least one 
million additional passengers in the first year and more than five million in the first five years."
Within its energy division, Stobart said it has "significantly" increased underlying earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, and amortization and tonnes supplied from a year ago despite continued delays in the commissioning 
of third-party energy plants.
"These delays have put pressure on the supply chain for the second year running and exaggerated the impact of 
non-underlying costs," the company, which named Nick Dilworth as the chief operating officer last month, noted in 
the update. "Therefore, the results for the energy division will be slightly below expectations in the short term." 
In relation to the rails and civils unit, Stobart, which also appointed Ginny Pulbrook as its interim chief financial 
officer in August, noted that it secured framework contracts with Network Rail, Transport for Greater Manchester. It 
pointed out, however, that the results for the year were likely to lag expectations because of the adoption of a "more 
prudent approach" to revenue recognition for long-term contracts.
Stobart is scheduled to publish its first-half results on Oct. 24.

Ryanair shareholders expressed their frustration at management on Thursday by re-electing the company's 
chairman by a significantly narrower margin than last year after a year overshadowed by the company's worst-ever 
industrial action. 
Chairman David Bonderman was re-elected with 70.5% of votes, compared to 89% who voted in favour last year.
But Chief Executive Michael O'Leary secured overwhelming re-election to the board with 98.5% of the vote, down 
from 99% last year.
"In every case we have substantial majorities," O'Leary told the meeting. "The overwhelming majority of our 
shareholders are supportive [of Bonderman] ... and we should be very appreciative."
O'Leary said he had been asked by the company's remuneration committee to extend his contract beyond 2019 
and that he intended to do so.
Several investors, including Royal London Asset Management and Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum 
(LAPFF), had announced publicly that they would oppose Bonderman's re-election.
Some investors cited the company's treatment of staff and the need for renewal on the board for their opposition to 
Bonderman.
Bonderman, who is a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, resigned from the board of Uber in 2017 after an 
ill-judged joke that more women on the board means "more talking".

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary retained his position with overwhelming backing at the budget airline's 
annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday, despite having presided over recent pilot and crew strikes that have 
caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
O'Leary was backed by 98.5 per cent of shareholders at the meeting near Dublin, Ryanair confirmed on Thursday. 
"The board wants me to extend my contract," O'Leary reportedly said at the AGM. Chairman David Bonderman also 
retains his position, with 70.5-per-cent backing.
Ryanair's marketing chief Kenny Jacobs said on Tuesday that he believed O'Leary would stay in post for another 
five years, but the German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit had called on Ryanair shareholders to vote in a new 
leadership.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots and crew across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the 
height of this year's summer holiday season, with the airline's share price plummeting as a result.
Cabin-crew unions from Spain, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands have announced a strike over pay and 
conditions for September 28. Pilots in Italy are also set to strike, though a deal was struck last week with Italian 
cabin-crew unions after Ryanair approved better pay and conditions.

ROYAL London Asset Management is the latest Ryanair investor to pledge to vote against the re-election of the 
airline's long-serving chairman David Bonderman at its annual meeting (AGM) today.
The UK-based firm has also taken issue with the airline's proposal to remove voting rights for British shareholders 
post-Brexit.
Ryanair has said there is the risk that in the event of a hard Brexit UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU, so is 
examining how it can remain majority EU-controlled.
Ryanair has come under pressure following a summer of strike action, and concerns that Bonderman's 20 years at 
the helm threatens the independence of the board.
A spokesperson for Ryanair said: "Ryanair shareholders will pass all AGM resolutions by a large majority this year, 
including the nomination of directors and chairman."

Belgian union turns down Ryanair offer ahead of planned strike

The union representing cabin crew in Belgium turned down an offer by Ryanair ahead of a planned strike on Sept. 
28, it said on Wednesday.
Europe's largest low-cost airline offered to follow Belgian employment law from March 2020 for Ryanair contracted 
employees, addressing one of the major complaints over the company's policy to staff under Irish contract.
The Belgian union, CNE, said that would only help about half of workers, as Ryanair has also been hiring under 
Crewlink contracts, the statement said.
The union said the offer was an "unacceptable" attempt to divide workers in order to buy time ahead of the planned 
strike.
"It's a deception on the part of Ryanair," CNE spokesman Yves Lambot told Reuters.
Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The threatened strike by cabin crews in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain is aimed at pressuring 
shareholders set to meet on Sept. 20 to address Ryanair's labour agreements, union officials announced last week.
The 24-hour strike is planned for Sept. 28 and unions will strike once a month until demands are met.
The Belgian union met with Ryanair officials before announcing the strike and asked for an offer by Tuesday. The 
offer was made on Tuesday evening, Lambot said.
Belgian union turns down Ryanair offer ahead of planned strike
A Ryanair board member said on Tuesday that the CEO, Michael O'Leary, would continue at the company's top for 
at least five more years.
"That would be a disappointment" and would not show a change in attitude within the company, Lambot said.
The airline is striving for a union agreement in Germany before Christmas, following strikes by cabin crews and 
pilots this month and threatened further strikes. (Reuters)

Ryanair has indicated its readiness to start operating French bases again, citing a national supreme-court 
judgement relating to social insurance payments collected for Marseille-stationed crew between 2006 and 2010.
The budget carrier says the ruling reinforces one previously handed down by the European Court of Justice, which 
deemed social-security certificates issued by the Ireland to be binding on French authorities. The case will now be 
reheard by Parisian appeal court, adds Ryanair, which expects repayment of some 13 million ($15 million) "in due 
course".
It says the supreme-court decision "paves the way for Ryanair to consider re-entering the French market", adding: 
"We are already in discussions with a number of French airports, and the French ministry of labour, which we hope 
will lead to Ryanair announcing some bases in France in the near future, but with pilots and cabin crew based in 
France, on local French contracts, and paying their social taxes in France rather than Ireland."
FlightGlobal schedules data show Ryanair's French capacity has stayed relatively flat since 2013.

Berenberg put "buy" ratings on Air France-KLM and Hungary's Wizz Air in a note starting coverage of the European 
airline sector.
Even though margins peaked in 2017 and were broadly declining, investors should favour long-haul carriers to the 
low-cost operators that tended to find favour late in the cycle, Berenberg said.
It forecast that low funding costs and industry bullishness would translate to 9 per cent short-haul capacity growth 
next year, with the increasing competition creating downside risk to pricing.
For long haul, Berenberg forecast a relative easing of competitive pressure next year as European wide-body 
capacity additions slowed and economic conditions remained helpful, underpinned by 3 per cent global gross 
domestic product growth. Yet flag-carrier valuations remained below median levels, which "provides support if 
pricing positively surprises the market in coming quarters", Berenberg said.
As part of the same research, Berenberg gave Lufthansa and Ryanair "hold" ratings. Yesterday, Air France-KLM 
gained 1.9 per cent, Wizz Air was up 1.6 per cent, Lufthansa climbed 0.9 per cent and Ryanair was also 0.9 per 
cent higher. FT reporters

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) received a hold investment rating from Berenberg as the firm launched coverage of the 
European airline sector, saying it sees value in the long haul. 
Berenberg's initiation of Ryanair's stock came with a price target for the company's London-traded shares of 
EUR13.50 each, slightly below the stock's Monday close of EUR13.52. The shares were up 0.6% recently at 
EUR13.60. 
The price target translates to about $15.77. With each American depositary share representing five ordinary shares, 
the implied price target for the American depositary shares is $78.85, below the shares' Monday closing price of 
$96.60. 
In a note to clients, Berenberg said "we struggle to find a path for Ryanair to return to [fiscal] 2018 profit levels 
before [fiscal] 2021." The firm also cautioned that it expects lower free cash flow in fiscal 2019, which it said 
"suggests pressure on the company's ambitions for future buybacks." 
While the firm highlighted that Ryanair's LaudaMotion equity holding in Vienna "gave Ryanair desirable slots from 
central Europe on key leisure routes," it also noted competitors have scheduled back-fill capacity at record speed, 
adding "we expect pricing pressure into 2019, when European seat capacity appears set to reaccelerate." 
Berenberg also warned clients it expects "near-term share price volatility as bargaining negotiations and strike 
threats drive headlines." It added: "The expiry of CEO Michael O'Leary's employment contract in September 2019 
may also pressure valuation."

 Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) is hoping to find an agreement with German unions before the busy holiday 
season, Reuters reported.
Speaking at a travel industry conference Tuesday, the airline's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, also said the 
company's cost position would be significantly more attractive than that of its competitors even if it signed deals with 
unions.
Jacobs' remarks come after pilots and cabin crew held a one-day strike this month, and threatened further industrial 
action.

Sep 17, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Ryanair 
passenger caught a baggage handler opening a suitcase and stealing a speaker, the Sun reported Sunday. The 
passenger, who was traveling from Ibiza to Madrid, Spain, alerted an air steward about the incident. 
The video showed the handler unzipping a passenger's suitcase placed on a luggage trolley and pulling out a red 
speaker that he shoved in his pocket.  Police said the man confessed to stealing the item, which was returned to its 
owner -- a teenager traveling to the Spanish capital with his mother.The incident, which was first reported by the 
Sun,[1]took place Friday morning. 'The police told me it was the third day the man had been working at the airport 
and returned the speaker to me immediately...I was very grateful because I had bought it for my son's birthday," the 
boy's mother toldlocal media Diario de Ibiza. The baggage handler, who had started working three days before the 
incident, was fired and will face trial on theft charges. [embedded content] This is not the first time a baggage 
handler was accused of mistreating passengers' luggage.In May, a woman caught a ground crew member on 
camera throwing luggage carelessly at Honolulu airportwhile loading up a flight to Phoenix. 'The mystery of all my 
broken suitcases is solved — this is the ground crew at Honolulu loading up a @HawaiianAir flight to Phoenix,' 
Vanessa Marsh tweeted at the time,prompting Hawaiian Airlines to comment. 'Aloha Vanessa, we're very sorry to 
see this and appreciate you bringing it to our attention,' the authorities wrote. 'The way these bags were handled is 
not acceptable and our Airport Operations Management team is addressing this situation. Thank you.' In another 
incident, which took place last year,baggage handlers were filmedhurling and kicking bags after dragging them from 
a planeat London's Luton Airport. The furious passenger who captured the incident said at the time: 'How can you 
be so sick and disrespectful? Hope these idiots get kicked in the face — and then fired.' A Ryanair airplane taxis

Birmingham airport may have to wait until 2020 to regain transatlantic services after Primera cancelled its flights to 
Newark, Boston and Toronto from the UK gateway this summer.
Speaking to FlightGlobal at the World Routes show in Guangzhou today, Tom Screen, Birmingham’s acting aviation 
director, says there might be an "option" for an alternative airline to start a New York service in summer 2019. He 
says it is "more likely", however, that such connections will come in 2020 when JetBlue is likely to receive deliveries 
of Airbus A321LRs and WestJet is also expected to be in a position to start a Toronto-Birmingham service.
Primera originally announced services from Birmingham to Newark, Boston and Toronto for May 2018, but 
subsequently cancelled its Boston plan before it was launched. Flights to Newark and Toronto were suspended in 
June.
Screen says Birmingham’s passenger numbers for 2018 will be "slightly down" on those of 2017 as a result of the 
collapse of UK short-haul carrier Monarch Airlines in October 2017. The airport is forecasting it will handle 12.5 
million passengers this year compared with just under 13 million in 2017.
He says the UK airport has been able to replace approximately 70% of the capacity that was lost, with Jet2 and TUI 
substituting the bulk of services along with Ryanair. He says the airport has deliberately not sought to replace all of 
the lost flights.
"We took a decision with our shareholders that replacing all of the lost Monarch traffic that we had was probably the 
wrong thing to do because there is a reason why Monarch went out of business – because there was too much 
capacity in the market," he says.
Birmingham aims to regain transatlantic flights by 2020 E Birmingham airport may have to wait until 2020 to 
regain transatlantic services after Primera cancelle....
Simon Richards, acting chief executive of Birmingham airport, says the drop in passenger numbers has allowed 
Birmingham to focus on improving the standard of its customer services.
He says the "most tangible change" has been in the security checking process, where a new preparation area has 
been added. The airport has also begun a £50 million ($65 million) terminal expansion programme.
Screen and Richards say Birmingham airport expects to see its passenger numbers rebound to 13 million in 2019 
as a result of additional capacity offered by Jet2 and TUI next summer, and the increase in Turkish Airlines' 
frequencies to Istanbul from 12 a week now to 14 a week.

Vienna airport’s chief executive Julian Jager expects to see some consolidation in low-cost carrier operations next 
year as competition between various budget operators at the Austrian gateway intensifies.
Speaking to FlightGlobal at the World Routes conference in Guangzhou today, Jager says the Austrian capital's 
airport has welcomed the start of operations by budget carriers Wizz, Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion and IAG’s 
low-cost operator Level this summer, while EasyJet has been growing "a lot" due to its expanded presence at 
Berlin. Eurowings has also expanded "very strongly" this year.
Jager, who is also the airport’s chief operating officer, says he does not expect all of these players to be "equally 
successful" in 2019 as they seek to compete in the same key "battlegrounds" in the Spanish, Italian and French 
markets.
However, he still expects the additional low-cost capacity being deployed to lead to "significant" passenger growth 
at Vienna in 2019, with the gateway forecasting a record 26 million passengers this year. That growth could even 
be above the Austrian airport’s previous guidance of a 6% rise in passenger numbers, he adds.
"Overall, we believe that we will have above-average growth in the remaining months of 2018 and into 2019," he 
states.
Jager says the airport has now regained all of the routes it had previously lost with the demise of Air Berlin and its 
Austrian subsidiary Niki.
Enhanced low-cost competition has also led to average air fares coming down "very significantly" on selected 
tourist routes, Jager notes.
Vienna airport chief foresees consolidation of LCC presence; Vienna airport’s chief executive Julian Jager 
expects to see some "consolidation" in the low-cost s....
Meanwhile, he says the airport is getting "closer and closer" to securing final regulatory approval to build a third 
runway, and the matter is currently being considered by Austria’s constitutional court. He states he is hopeful this 
"legal battle" can be resolved in the next six to 18 months.
The airport is to spend approximately 500 million ($581 million) on refurbishing its Terminal 2, modernising its non-
Schengen Pier East facility and extending its Terminal 3 over the next four to five years. There will be a staggered 
opening of these facilities concluding around 2023.
Demand for services to East Asia is also rising, Jager says, with traffic growth of 34% so far this year, and 43% in 
August alone.
He states he is optimistic that the Austrian airport can secure at least two additional long-haul connections in 2019.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said pre-market Friday that it has reached a deal with three Italian unions on a set of principles 
that will form the basis of a collective labor agreement (CLA).
The Irish budget carrier met with the FIT CISL, Anpac and Anpav cabin crew unions in Rome. "The parties agreed 
that they are now in the final stages of concluding final terms and conditions of a CLA," the low-cost carrier said.
The CLA will take effect for three years, from Oct. 1, 2018 to Dec. 31, 2021, and will be governed by Italian law. The 
parties have also agreed to allow Italian cabin crew to transition to local contracts over an agreed period.
The company also said that the CLA will ensure increased pay under a new pay structure, which will see crews 
benefit from increased tax free allowances, comparable to other Italian airlines. It will also launch an Italian pension 
scheme as part of the overall package.
"We expect to sign this first CLA for our Italian cabin crew before the end of Sept, which will lead to significant pay 
improvements and other benefits for our Italian based cabin crew," said Ryanair's Eddie Wilson.
"This agreement is a further sign of the significant progress Ryanair is making in reaching agreements with our 
people and their unions in different EU countries, and disproves false claims made by smaller unions not involved in 
these negotiations, and who are threatening strikes later this winter, which will either not take place or be 
unsuccessful," Wilson said.

CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV unions signed 'a set of agreed principles [...] which will form the basis of a 
comprehensive Collective Labour Agreement,' Ryanair said in a statement. 
 The airline said it agreed to grant Italian labour and pension rights - rather than less generous Irish ones - and 
'higher pay under a new pay structure' linked to a more favourable tax regime.  'This agreement follows recent 
cabin crew agreements in Ireland with FORSA [union] and in the UK with UNITE [union],' Ryanair's Chief People 
Officer Eddie Wilson said.  In a separate statement, the Italian unions said they also negotiated the right to be paid 
via Italian bank accounts and secured less stressful shift regimes.  The collective agreement should run for three 
years, until the end of 2021, the parties said, and it is due to be signed in the coming days.  The deal was 
announced a day after flight attendant unions from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands announced 
a strike over pay and conditions for September 28.  In August, Ryanair signed another collective labour agreement 
with Italian pilots. Their union ANPAC said it was the first of its kind in Europe, and hailed it as 'historic.'  However, 
other Italian pilot unions, Filt Cgil and Uiltrasporti, said Thursday that their members rejected that deal in a 
referendum, and would also strike on September 28.   Copyright dpa

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks rose slightly on Friday as media reports 
suggesting the possibility of another round of talks between the United States and China helped ease market 
worries over the escalating tariff war that threatens to derail global economic growth.  Concerns about emerging 
markets also eased somewhat after Turkey's central bank raised its key interest rate sharply in a dramatic bid to 
control rocketing inflation and prevent a currency crisis.  The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.2 
percent at 377.19 in late opening deals after declining 0.2 percent on Thursday. 
  The German DAX and France's CAC 40 index were up around 0.3 percent, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 0.1 
percent.   Technology stocks surged after Apple led a rebound in technology shares on Wall Street overnight. 
Infineon and STMicroelectronics both rose around 2 percent   Automakers were also broadly higher as trade war 
concerns eased. Daimler gained 1 percent, Volkswagen jumped 1.6 percent and Renault advanced 2.5 percent.   
British asset manager Investec soared 10 percent after announcing a demerger.  Close Brothers Group rallied 2 
percent. The merchant banking group has unveiled plans to sell Close Brothers Retail Finance to Swedish payment 
solutions group Klarna Bank AB for an undisclosed amount.  SThree, a specialist STEM staffing business, jumped 
over 4 percent after its third-quarter group gross profit increased 13 percent from last year.  Irish low-cost airline 
Ryanair advanced 1.4 percent after it reached agreement with Italian unions on outline terms of a Collective Labour 
Agreement.  Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey shed 0.8 percent and rival Barratt Developments declined 0.7 percent 
after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of sharp house price falls in the event of a chaotic no-deal 
Brexit.  In economic releases, the euro area trade surplus declined to the lowest level in four years in July, figures 
from Eurostat showed.  The trade surplus fell to a seasonally adjusted EUR 12.76 billion from EUR 16.47 billion in 
June. This was the lowest since June 2014, when the surplus totaled EUR 12.22 billion.

 The European markets remained stuck in a sideways pattern throughout Friday's session. 
Despite the lackluster trading action, the majority of the markets ended the day with slight gains.
Traders were encouraged by reports that another round of talks between the US and China could take place in the 
near future.
Concerns about emerging markets also eased somewhat after Turkey's central bank raised its key interest rate 
sharply in a dramatic bid to control rocketing inflation and prevent a currency crisis.
The Bank of France on Friday cut its economic growth forecast for this year through 2020 amid the less dynamic 
and more uncertain external situation.
GDP growth would be 1.6% this year, next year and in 2020, the bank said.
Previously, the bank projected 1.8% growth for 2018 and 1.7% expansion in 2019.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.4%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks 
increased 0.3%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, added 0.3%.
The DAX of Germany climbed 0.6% and the CAC of France rose 0.5%. The FTSE 100 of the UK gained 0.3% and 
the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.1%.
In London, Investec soared 8.4% after announcing that it will spin off its asset management business.
Close Brothers Group rallied 1.9%. The merchant banking group has unveiled plans to sell Close Brothers Retail 
Finance to Swedish payment solutions group Klarna Bank AB for an undisclosed amount.
SThree, a specialist STEM staffing business, jumped 6.4% after its third-quarter group gross profit increased 13% 
from last year.

Low-cost airline Ryanair advanced 1.2% after it reached agreement with Italian unions on outline terms of a 
collective labour agreement.
Homebuilder Taylor Wimpey rose 0.1% and rival Barratt Developments declined 0.7% after Bank of England 
Governor Mark Carney warned of sharp house price falls in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit.
The euro area trade surplus declined to the lowest level in four years in July, figures from Eurostat showed Friday. 
The trade surplus fell to a seasonally adjusted EUR12.76 billion from EUR16.47 billion in June. This was the lowest 
since June 2014, when the surplus totalled EUR12.22 billion.
Eurozone's hourly labor cost increased at a slightly faster pace in the second quarter, data from Eurostat showed 
Friday. Hourly labor cost advanced 2.2% from previous year following a 2.1% rise in the first quarter.
China's industrial production and retail sales growth improved in August, while investment growth slowed down, 
indicating the weakness in the economic momentum.
Industrial production climbed 6.1% year-on-year in August, in line with expectations, but slightly faster than the 6% 
increase seen in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed Friday.
Retail sales growth improved to 9% in August from 8.8% in July. The rate was expected to remain unchanged at 
8.8%.
Partly reflecting a drop in sales by motor vehicle and parts dealers, the Commerce Department released a report on 
Friday showing retail sales in the US increased by much less than expected in the month of August.
The Commerce Department said retail sales inched up by 0.1% in August after climbing by an upwardly revised 
0.7% in July. Economists had expected retail sales to rise by 0.4% compared to the 0.5% increase originally 
reported for the previous month.

the Labor Department on Friday.
The Labor Department said import prices dropped by 0.6% in August after edging down by a revised 0.1% in July.
Economists had expected import prices to dip by 0.2% compared to the unchanged reading originally reported for 
the previous month.
The report also said export prices slipped by 0.1% in August after falling by 0.5% in July. Export prices had been 
expected to come in unchanged.
A report released by the Federal Reserve on Friday showed US industrial production rose by slightly more than 
expected in the month of August. The Fed said industrial production climbed by 0.4% in August, matching the 
upwardly revised increase in July.
Economists had expected production to rise by 0.3% compared to the 0.1% uptick originally reported for the 
previous month.
Business inventories in the US increased in line with economist estimates in the month of July, the Commerce 
Department revealed in a report released on Friday. The Commerce Department said business inventories climbed 
by 0.6% in July after inching up by 0.1% in June.

to a report released by the University of Michigan on Friday. The report said the consumer sentiment index jumped 
to 100.8 in September from 96.2 in August. Economists had expected the index to inch up to 96.6.

Ryanair faces 1 day strike in five countries over contracts

Ryanair faces a one-day walkout by cabin crew across five countries on Sept. 28 as unions step up pressure on 
Europe's biggest budget airline to accept local contracts.
The threatened strike in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain is aimed at pressuring shareholders set 
to meet on Sept. 20 to address Ryanair's labour agreements, union officials said on Thursday.
They said unions would strike once a month until their demands are met.
"It is time the company accepted to employ us with local contracts under local conditions in accordance with local 
law," Didier Lebbe, a spokesman for the CNE union in Belgium, told a news conference in Brussels.
"We need shareholders to change Ryanair's employment model," he said, and called for European political 
mediation.
Ryanair employs staff across Europe under Irish contracts, but some unions want the ability to negotiate terms 
under the employment laws of their own country.
Belgian unions forecast most flights out of Ryanair's two airports in Belgium will be cancelled, challenging the 
company's pledge to minimise disruptions.
Some pilots in Italy will also join the industrial action on the day, the Uiltrasporti union said.
A spokesman for Ryanair said "there will be no pilot strike in Italy", adding that Ryanair had already signed a 
collective labour agreement with the ANPAC union and does not recognise the "small" Uiltrasporti union.
Ryanair faces 1 day strike in five countries over contracts
Unions representing three of the airline's Italy-based cabin crews said in a statement on Thursday they had agreed 
in principle to a three-year collective labour agreement.
Fit Cisl, Anpac and Anpav unions signed Thursday's agreement, but Uiltrasporti was not mentioned.
Ryanair has struggled to curb an industrial relations revolt in recent months and was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 
German flights on Wednesday after a walkout by pilots and crew.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in response that the airline, which flies some 2,500 flights a day, was willing 
to accept strikes if that was the cost of defending its low-cost business model.
Amid management's clashes with unions, shares in Ryanair have fallen 13 percent this year.
Unions across the five countries set to walk out on Sep. 28 told a news conference on Thursday that the strike 
could be averted if shareholders were able to force change to labour contracts at their annual meeting on Sept. 20.
"Shareholders need to take responsibility and change the management, at least in human resources," CNE's Lebbe 
said.
Ryanair said that even if there is a strike, it expects a significant majority of its cabin crew in Spain, Italy, Belgium, 
the Netherlands and Portugal to work normally, as they have during previous strikes.
"As we demonstrated in Germany yesterday, Ryanair will pre-advise customers of a small number of flight 
cancellations," Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement.
Ryanair suffered its worst ever strikes this summer after slow progress in negotiating collective labour agreements 
with pilots and cabin crew.
In August it reached a deal with striking Irish pilots, but unions representing pilots and cabin crew in Germany have 
threatened further walkouts if Ryanair does not improve offers on terms and pay. (Reuters)

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. stocks held steady on Friday, with a firmer pound limiting

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair (RYA.L, RYAAY) announced Friday that it has reached 
agreement with Italian unions on outline terms of a Collective Labour Agreement or CLA.  In London, Ryanair 
shares were gaining around 2 percent to trade at 13.32 euros.  In a statement, the company confirmed that it met in 
Rome on Thursday with the 3 main cabin crew unions FIT CISL, ANPAC, and ANPAV, and a set of agreed 
principles were signed, which will form the basis of a comprehensive CLA to cover Ryanair's Italian based cabin 
crew from October 1, 2018.  The parties agreed that they are now in the final stages of concluding final terms and 
conditions of a CLA. 
 The CLA will run for 3 years from October 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021. It will be governed by Italian law and the 
Italian Courts, and would allow Italian cabin crew transition to local contracts over an agreed period.  Further, CLA 
will deliver increased pay under a new pay structure, which will see crews benefit from increased tax free 
allowances, similar to other Italian airlines. It will also introduce an Italian Pension Scheme as part of the overall 
package.   Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said, 'This agreement follows recent cabin crew agreements 
in Ireland with FORSA and in the UK with UNITE... We expect to sign this first CLA for our Italian cabin crew before 
the end of Sept, which will lead to significant pay improvements and other benefits for our Italian based cabin crew.'  
In late August, Ryanair confirmed that its Italian pilots had voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new CLA which was 
negotiated and signed between Ryanair and ANPAC (Italian Airline Pilots Association). Italy accounts for 20 percent 
of Ryanair's fleet and pilots.

Budget carrier Ryanair and trade unions representing cabin crew in Italy have reached an agreement that will allow 
staff to be employed under local contracts.
A set of "agreed principles" negotiated with FIT-CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV will form the basis of a collective labour 
deal applicable from 1 October 2018 until 31 December 2021, says the airline.
It notes that the parties are in "the final stages" of concluding terms and conditions of the collective deal, which will 
be governed by Italian law.
Cabin crew will be allowed to "transition to local contracts over an agreed period", says Ryanair.
It adds that the deal will increase crew members' pay and enable them to benefit from "increased tax-free 
allowances, similar to other Italian airlines".
A pension scheme is also part of the package.
Ryanair chief people officer Eddie Wilson expects the collective deal to be signed by the end of the month. It will 
follow cabin-crew agreements the airline has reached with Irish union Forsa and the UK's United.
Wilson describes the Italian accord as "a further sign of the significant progress Ryanair is making in reaching 
agreements with our people and their unions in different EU countries".
He goes on to argue that the deal disproves "claims made by smaller unions not involved in these negotiations, and 
who are threatening strikes later this winter, which will either not take place or be unsuccessful".

ITALIAN pilots will join a strike by Ryanair's cabin crew members on 28 September amid an ongoing dispute with 
the airline over pay and working conditions.
It came as Belgian cabin crew members yesterday vowed to create "travel chaos" with the strike.
Strikes have cast a cloud over Ryanair's summer, with the airline struggling to contain discontent among unions 
across Europe.
The airline hit back at what it called "false claims" by the union yesterday, saying only a "small number" of flights 
would be cancelled if there was a strike.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said earlier in the week that strikes were the price it had to pay to defend its low-
cost business model.

Ryanair CEO willing to put up with strikes to defend low costs

Pilots and cabin crew at Ryanair in Germany staged a full-day walkout on Wednesday and threatened further 
strikes as management at Europe's largest low-cost carrier struggled to rein in an industrial relations revolt.
The strike came a day before unions representing cabin crew in five countries - including No. 2 and 3 markets Italy 
and Spain - were due to announce whether to hold a joint strike later this month.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary was defiant, telling a press briefing in London that he was willing to accept strikes 
if that was the cost of defending the airline's low-cost business model.
"We will not roll over every time we're threatened with strikes," he said. "We do not want strikes but we are willing to 
accept strikes, put up with them, if it means defending our cost base."
He said strikes were having a minimal impact on overall operations and that full-year profit guidance was 
unchanged as it had already included some of the impact of the stoppages.
Shares in Ryanair reversed earlier modest losses to trade 0.8 percent up by 1435 GMT.
The Ireland-based airline said it canceled 150 out of a total 400 flights scheduled to fly to and from Germany on 
Wednesday due to the strike and warned that such "wildcat" strikes would lead to job cuts if they continued.
The airline, which flies around 2,500 flights each day, said all passengers had been refunded or switched to other 
flights.
Ryanair CEO willing to put up with strikes to defend low costs
"As long as Ryanair does not make improved offers, there may have to be further strikes here," said Ingolf 
Schumacher, a negotiator for German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC).
While both sides have agreed to employ a mediator, they have not agreed on who this should be. Ryanair has also 
come under fire for its practice of employing some pilots via third-party agencies, though it said all pilots will be 
directly employed by the end of the year.
 
"SQUEEZING CREW"
Ryanair said its latest offer to Germany's VC addressed all of the union's demands and called the walkouts 
unreasonable.
In July it said it would move 20 percent of its Dublin-based fleet to Poland due in part to the damage strike action 
was doing to bookings but reversed the decision last Friday.
German services union Verdi, which represents cabin crew, is seeking a substantial pay increase as well as local 
contracts for its members. It said management had, however, offered local contracts only from 2022.
At Germany's biggest airport in Frankfurt, union members carried banners through a terminal, saying "Ryanair stop 
squeezing your crew."
O'Leary did concede that the strikes had damaged customer confidence.
"Our fares are undoubtedly a percentage point or two lower than they would otherwise be this summer," he said.
The airline decided to recognize unions last December after a 30-year period in an attempt to improve relations with 
its pilots and ease a staffing crunch.
But failure to reach agreement with staff on conditions led to its worst ever strikes this summer.
Ryanair secured a breakthrough in August when it reached a deal with Irish pilots.
But last week, seven trade unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the 
Netherlands threatened to hold a strike in late September unless the airline agrees to improve working conditions.
O'Leary said that the airline was making progress with unions in Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands.
Local contracts remained a sticking point, he said, explaining that Ryanair's hands were tied by Irish legislation on 
that matter. He said Ryanair was hopeful that the Irish government would change the rules. (Reuters)

Budget airline Ryanair has confirmed that flight attendants in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands 
will strike over pay and conditions on September 28.
"Ryanair management chose to continue to ignore the law and [to continue] with the bullying culture that is part of 
the company for decades," said a statement signed by trade unions from the five countries.
The statement reiterates their demands to work under local contracts, bound by local standards. Many Ryanair staff 
across Europe have Irish employment contracts, which the trade unions argue give them worse conditions than 
under local law.
"We will not back down until these demands are met," the statement says, calling on Ryanair's investors and 
shareholders to take a stand at the company's annual general meeting on September 20.
The announcement came shortly after the airline resumed operations on Thursday following a 24-hour strike that 
caused the carrier to cancel 150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany the previous day.
In a statement announcing the new strike, Ryanair dismissed claims that the Wednesday strike had caused "travel 
chaos," saying that 70 per cent of its Germany-based pilots and cabin crew had reported for work despite the 
stoppage.
"Repeated false claims made by unions about 'travel chaos' have proven to be unfounded," said Ryanair's 
marketing chief Kenny Jacobs, adding that despite the "partial" September 28 strike, the airline would "carry the 
overwhelming majority of the 400,000 passengers who will be scheduled to fly with us that day."
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) and German workers union Verdi organized the strike in an effort to 
push for better pay and conditions for their members.

Ryanair's hubs at Frankfurt (Hahn) and Berlin-Schoenefeld were most affected by the cancellations.
The airline dismissed the industrial action as unjustified, citing offers it has already put on the table. German 
Ryanair employees had also walked out for a day in August.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary Wedneday said Ryanair would not "roll over" because of a one-day 
strike which he termed "somewhat unsuccessful."
O'Leary accused the unions of making a "ludicrous demand" earlier this year for a 42-per-cent pay increase.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of this 
year's summer holiday season.
Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are among the other countries where 
Ryanair pilots and cabin staff have taken strike action.

UK investigators have determined that a fatigue crack in the nose-gear axle of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 caused 
one of the wheels to detach on take-off from London Stansted.
The left axle of the inner cylinder failed as the jet (EI-DLV) turned onto runway 22 in preparation for a departure to 
Copenhagen on 15 September last year. It diverted to East Midlands airport.
Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) analysis found that the axle journal, while being overhauled, had 
sustained a re-tempering burn during post-chrome plate grinding.
AAIB
This would have resulted in heat-induced cracking in the base metal, it states, which “probably” grew through 
hydrogen embrittlement cracking during cadmium plating.
Visual inspections did not detect the presence of any cracks in the chrome surface – which, in any case, would 
have been microscopic – and there was no requirement to conduct an inspection with fluorescent dye.
“Because no cracks were detected, the part was returned to service,” says the inquiry. “Over time, in-service axle 
flexure caused fatigue cracks to initiate from the hydrogen embrittlement region, and propagate through the wall of 
the axle.”
It states that, while the cause of the original grinding burns could not be determined, there was “no effective 
mechanism” for detecting them.

The cylinder involved had previously been installed on a different 737-800, line number 1642, and had accumulated 
nearly 22,100 cycles since new.
It had been overhauled in December 2014 at just over 17,000 cycles before being installed on the aircraft involved 
in the incident.
Since the failure, says the inquiry, the maintenance and overhaul organisation has introduced another inspection 
procedure specifically to identify any journals which have suffered grinding problems.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary reacted to the latest walkout by its German pilots yesterday by saying the 
airline was willing to put up with industrial action if it meant defending its cost base and ability to offer low fares.
At a press conference in London, he conceded that a series of strikes at the European carrier had "damaged 
customer confidence" and said he had acquired a new "humility" given recent problems.
He added: "We are not easyJet. We will not roll over every time we are threatened with a strike."
Mr O'Leary also attacked the British government's lack of progress on post-Brexit aviation arrangements, saying he 
had not spoken to transport secretary Chris Grayling in almost a year.
"There is every reason to believe the UK government would say in desperation 'everyone is free to land here', but 
there is no indication the reverse is true," he said.
Mr O'Leary revealed that the German pilots' union had proposed Gerhard Schroeder as arbitrator in their dispute 
but Ryanair had rejected the country's former chancellor, saying he would take too long to get up to speed with the 
issues.
Ryanair cancelled 150 German flights out of 400 yesterday.
In the wake of the British Airways data hack, in which criminals stole the personal and credit card details of 380,000 
customers, Mr O'Leary said he was in no position to give advice to BA, given Ryanair's troubles and the "enormous 
O'Leary says Ryanair will not bow to strikes Airlines
challenges around data protection" all large companies faced. But he did take a swipe at BA, saying that "we 
haven't subcontracted out a lot of our IT and digital development", which could make Ryanair's website safer.
BA has denied that outsourcing had anything to do with the hack.
Mr O'Leary's remarks came after the airline was hit by a summer of strikes involving two days from Portuguese, 
Belgian and Spanish cabin crew unions and a walkout by pilots in five countries on August 10, forcing the company 
to cancel 400 flights or 15 per cent of its daily total.
The unions have a list of complaints, underpinned by Ryanair's refusal to hire staff under local laws with attendant 
rights and benefits. All staff are employed under Irish law.
Mr O'Leary said the company was "happy" to introduce local contracts but Irish tax law prevented this under certain 
circumstances.
He said Ryanair would "certainly look at setting up" registration for its aircraft outside Ireland if the government did 
not change the law.
Last week, seven unions representing cabin crew, pilots and ground-handling staff from Italy, Portugal, Belgium, 
Spain and the Netherlands said they would announce a concerted strike for the end of this month.
In a letter, the combined unions demanded shareholders vote out Ryanair's current board at the company's annual 
meeting on September 20 as it was "incapable of having meaningful talks with the unions".

"There is every reason to believe the UK government would say in desperation 'everyone is free to land here', but 
there is no indication the reverse is true," he said.
Mr O'Leary revealed that the German pilots' union had proposed Gerhard Schroeder as arbitrator in their dispute 
but Ryanair had rejected the country's former chancellor, saying he would take too long to get up to speed with the 
issues.
Ryanair cancelled 150 German flights out of 400 yesterday.
In the wake of the British Airways data hack, in which criminals stole the personal and credit card details of 380,000 
customers, Mr O'Leary said he was in no position to give advice to BA, given Ryanair's troubles and the "enormous 
O'Leary says Ryanair will not bow to strikes Airlines
challenges around data protection" all large companies faced. But he did take a swipe at BA, saying that "we 
haven't subcontracted out a lot of our IT and digital development", which could make Ryanair's website safer.
BA has denied that outsourcing had anything to do with the hack.
Mr O'Leary's remarks came after the airline was hit by a summer of strikes involving two days from Portuguese, 
Belgian and Spanish cabin crew unions and a walkout by pilots in five countries on August 10, forcing the company 
to cancel 400 flights or 15 per cent of its daily total.
The unions have a list of complaints, underpinned by Ryanair's refusal to hire staff under local laws with attendant 
rights and benefits. All staff are employed under Irish law.
Mr O'Leary said the company was "happy" to introduce local contracts but Irish tax law prevented this under certain 
circumstances.
He said Ryanair would "certainly look at setting up" registration for its aircraft outside Ireland if the government did 
not change the law.
Last week, seven unions representing cabin crew, pilots and ground-handling staff from Italy, Portugal, Belgium, 
Spain and the Netherlands said they would announce a concerted strike for the end of this month.
In a letter, the combined unions demanded shareholders vote out Ryanair's current board at the company's annual 
meeting on September 20 as it was "incapable of having meaningful talks with the unions".

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary reacted to the latest walkout by its German pilots yesterday by saying the 
airline was willing to put up with industrial action if it meant defending its cost base and ability to offer low fares.
At a press conference in London, he conceded that a series of strikes at the European carrier had "damaged

RYANAIR'S chief executive Michael O'Leary has ramped up his warnings about a hard Brexit, saying the UK had 
received "no assurances" from the EU that flights could continue after Britain leaves the bloc.
At a press conference yesterday, the colourful chief executive said the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, had 
received "no assurances" from the EU on continued flying, and claimed that the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit was 
growing.
"If it's not a 21-month transition period, the thing that is not being well explained by the Brexiters is that flights to and 
from the EU will be stopped in a hard Brexit," O'Leary told reporters.
"Chris Grayling has yet to explain what else is going to be put in its place."
While he said he was confident the UK would reach a deal with the EU on flying rights, he said it would not be in 
time for April next year in the event of no deal being struck.
O'Leary warned earlier this year that flights could be grounded in March 2019, the deadline for when the UK leaves 
the EU.
If that happened a no-flights scenario would last no longer than "two days or two weeks" because it would be 
"politically unsellable", he claimed.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: "Aviation is absolutely crucial to the UK's economy and we are 
committed to getting the best deal possible for Britain.
Ryanair warns of grounded flights with hard Brexit
"We believe that it is in the interests of both sides to ensure continuity - but it is only sensible to prepare for a range 
of scenarios."

 Stocks in London are set to open broadly flat on Wednesday, with trade tensions rumbling on in the background 
but oil majors poised to benefit from an overnight rise in oil prices.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 1.06 points higher at 7,274.60 on Wednesday. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.1%, or 5.76 points at 7,273.54 on Tuesday.
"Wall Street traded higher overnight shrugging off trade tensions, amid rallying tech stocks led by Apple and a 2% 
gain in oil prices, Meanwhile Europe is looking to take the lead from the US with European bourses broadly looking 
to start the session on the front foot," said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher after a slightly negative start, with the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average rising 0.4%, the S&P 500 also gaining 0.4% and Nasdaq Composite advancing 0.6%.
Meanwhile, oil was quoted at USD79.35 a barrel early Wednesday, up from USD78.65 late Tuesday.
Lawler explained: "A combination of falling oil inventories, looming Iranian sanctions hitting output and hurricane 
Florence which is expected to hit the US east coast and disrupt the energy market boosted oil in early trade."
US sanctions against Iran are set to come into effect in the first week of November, with exports from Iran expected 
to fall by nearly 40%. In addition, hurricane Florence - which is is expected to strengthen into a near-Category 5 
storm as it approaches North and South Carolina - could cause flooding and power interruptions and result in the 
shutting down of Colonial Pipeline.
In UK political news, Theresa May's roles as UK prime minister was under fresh pressure after Tory MPs spent 
nearly an hour war-gaming how to oust her at a private meeting.
Around 50 MPs discussed ways and means of getting rid of the UK prime minister at a gathering of the European 
Research Group, the Press Association understands.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Flat Call; Supply, Florence Worries Lift Oil
A number of MPs told how they had already submitted letters of no confidence to Graham Brady, chairman of the 
1922 Committee, and others discussed plans to follow suit. If 48 letters are handed over a vote of no confidence 
would be triggered.
The flurry of activity came after former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launched a fresh attack on May's Brexit 
plan, claiming it would be "substantially worse than the status quo" for British businesses.
In early UK company news, Ryanair pilots and flights attendants are taking part in a 24-hour strike that started at 
3.01 am local time in Germany on Wednesday, which has caused the budget airline to cancel 150 of its 400 flights 
to and from Germany.
The strike is being organized by German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit and German workers union Verdi in an 
effort to push for better pay and conditions for their members.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index is down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 
0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is 0.4% lower.
In the corporate calendar on Wednesday, housebuilder Galliford Try and home furnishings retailer Dunelm publish 
full-year results while interims are due from insurance industry services provider Charles Taylor and tenpin bowling 
operator Ten Entertainment.
In the economic calendar on Wednesday, eurozone industrial production is at 1000 BST while, in the US, producer

Ryanair is lobbying the Irish government to change tax regulations such that the airline could meet a key demand of 
unions to contract staff under the employment laws of the country in which they reside.
Speaking at a media briefing in London today, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that at present the 
budget carrier could only offer its employees Irish contracts because the aircraft they work on were registered in the 
country, and its management based there.
O'Leary says Ryanair employees based outside of Ireland can pay their social taxes in their country of residence 
but must pay their income tax in Ireland. He notes that Ryanair cabin crew typically earn amounts that subject them 
to Ireland's higher tax rate.
"Ireland has this image as a corporate tax haven with low corporate tax rate, which to some extent it is, but it's 
penal [to] the person," he says.
He is "hopeful" the Irish government will acknowledge this as "major issue". He adds that if the government declines 
to make the necessary changes, Ryanair may be forced to apply for air operator certificates in other European 
countries as an alternative solution.
O'Leary says Ryanair would be open to providing staff with local contracts if it gained regulatory approval to do so. 
Such a concession has been a key demand of European unions representing Ryanair pilot and cabin crew across 
Europe.
He says such a move is part of the "bedding-down process" of dealing with local unions, which Ryanair in 
December 2017 agreed to start recognising.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees a rising chance that a no-deal Brexit will temporarily ground flights 
between the UK and EU.
At a media event in London today, O'Leary noted that the parties were "running out of time" to reach an agreement 
covering aviation before March 2019, and that even Brexiteers now admitted a hard Brexit was more likely.
He highlights the lack of progress in developing a bilateral successor to the open-skies deal, observing that the 27 
members of the EU had proven "remarkably united" in refusing to be "carved out" into agreeing separate air-access 
treaties with the UK.
O'Leary identifies a risk that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, aircraft would not be able operate between the UK and 
mainland Europe for a "couple of days or a couple of weeks" – but no longer than that, because "politically I think it 
will get solved pretty damned quickly".
A transition deal that keeps existing air-access rights in place between the UK and EU until 2021 is still the "most 
likely outcome" to the negotiations, O'Leary believes. He describes this as the best solution he could envisage for 
Ryanair and other European airlines.
Ryanair is prepared to restrict the voting rights of its UK and US shareholders in order to satisfy EU ownership rules 
under which a company registered within the bloc must be majority owned by European nationals, says O'Leary.
Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's marketing chief, says the carrier will grow capacity to London airports 5% next year, but 
notes that, pre-Brexit, it had forecast growth of more than 10%.

Ryanair pilots and flight attendants joined a 24-hour strike Wednesday that prompted the budget airline to cancel 
150 of its 400 flights to and from Germany.
The strike was organized by German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) and German workers' union Verdi in an 
effort to push for better pay and conditions for their members.
Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, said Ryanair would not "roll over" because of a one-day strike that 
was "somewhat unsucessful."
"The majority of our flights in Germany will still operate, so your strike has been somewhat unsucessful," O'Leary 
said in comments addressed to the German unions.
"We don't doubt the vigour of the German unions," he told reporters in London. "There is nothing that we haven't 
agreed to do, and yet they still want to go off and have their strike."
"We will not roll over," O'Leary added, accusing the unions of making a "ludicrous demand" earlier this year for a 
42-per-cent pay increase.
He insisted that recent strike action across Europe by Ryanair pilots and cabin staff had caused "minimal 
disruption" to the airline's operations.
"If you threaten us with a strike and we think your reason for that is unreasonable, then we will take strikes and we 
will manage our way around those strikes, as we've done successfully in Ireland, when we had five days of strikes 
by just 25 per cent of pilots," he said.

"It resulted in 20 flight cancellations a day for five days, out of a total of 300 flights that we operate daily to and from 
Ireland," he said.
"We don't want strikes but we are willing to accept strikes, put up with them, if it means defending our cost basis

BERLIN (AP) - German union officials say discount airline Ryanair is canceling dozens of flights after pilots and 
flight attendants started a one-day strike over pay and conditions.
The Cockpit union said the 24-hour strike began 3 a.m. Wednesday and would affect all the airline's bases in 
Germany, including Frankfurt and Berlin airports.
The union, representing pilots, is being joined by the ver.di union representing flight attendants based in Germany.
Ryanair was expected to cancel 150 of its flights to and from Germany through Thursday morning.
The unions say Ryanair hasn't given a satisfactory offer on pay and job conditions, but Ryanair says its proposals 
have been fair and there's no justification for a strike.
Ryanair pilots in several European countries last month staged a strike that prompted 400 flight cancelations.

Highlight: Ryanair has launched their biggest ever London S 2019 schedule, with 23 new routes (over 180 in total), 
which will deliver 26m customers p.a. through Ryanair's 4 London airports Stansted, Luton, Southend and Gatwick.
Body
Ryanair’s London S19 schedule will deliver:- A new 3 aircraft base at Southend- 2 more aircraft at Luton (6 in total)- 
23 new routes including:> 3 &nbsp;at &nbsp;Stansted: &nbsp; Kiev, Lviv & Nantes> 6 &nbsp;at &nbsp;Luton: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Bologna, Cork, Malaga> 14 at Southend: Alicante, Bilbao, 
Brest, Copenhagen, Cluj, Corfu, Dublin, Faro, Kosice, Malaga, Milan, Palma, Reus & Venice- Over 180 routes in 
total- 26m customers p.a. (up 5%)- 20,000&nbsp;“on-site” jobs p.a.Last week Ryanair submitted a complaint to the 
European Commission over discrimination by UK airline controlled NATS at Stansted, who refuse to explain why 
52% of all London ATC delays in Q1 were at Stansted while there was zero such delays at Heathrow and just 10% 
at Gatwick where (NATS’ shareholders) BA and Easyjet are the main airlines.We call on the UK Govt and EU to 
take prompt action against NATS who continue to deliver an atrocious service to airlines despite having amongst 
the highest ATC fees in the EU, and who are blatantly protecting Heathrow at the expense of all other London 
airports, especially Stansted. We expect the EU to act quickly to ensure a fairer allocation of NATS resources (and 
delays) to all 5 London airports, instead of protecting Heathrow.Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary said:&nbsp;“Ryanair is 
pleased to launch our biggest ever London S 2019 schedule with over 180 routes from our 4 London airports, 
including 1 new base at Southend and 23 new routes to exciting destinations such as Barcelona, Bilbao, 
Copenhagen and Kiev. 
Our S2019 schedule will deliver 26m customers p.a. through Stansted, Luton, Southend and Gatwick, all at the 
lowest fares, as we continue to grow London traffic, tourism and jobs. &nbsp;&nbsp;We remain concerned at the 
increasing risk of a hard (no-deal) Brexit in March 2019. &nbsp;While we hope that a 21-month transition 
agreement from March 2019 will be agreed, recent events in the UK have added uncertainty, and we believe that 
the risk of a hard Brexit (which could lead to flights being grounded for a period of days or weeks) is being 
underestimated.”

 The union representing Ryanair's (RYAAY) German pilots and cabin crew walked off the job on Wednesday and 
threatened further strike action to put pressure on management in labor talks with the Irish budget airliner, media 
reported.
Vereinigung Cockpit urged management to agree to mediation in its dispute over pay and terms. It also threatened 
to call further strikes if management does not improve its offer. "As long as Ryanair does not make improved offers, 
there may have to be further strikes here," said union representative Ingolf Schumacher. There is disagreement on 
who should act as negotiator for the two parties.
On Tuesday, the carrier said that it would cancel 150 out of a total 400 flights scheduled to fly to and from Germany 
on the day of the strike. It also warned that such "wildcat" strikes would result in job cuts if they persisted.
It also said that the walkout was "unacceptable" and "unnecessary," adding that its latest offer addressed all of the 
union's demands.

BERLIN (AP) - German unions are calling on Ryanair pilots and flight attendants in the country to stage a one-day 
strike on Wednesday, citing what they say is the lack of a satisfactory offer on pay and conditions.
The Cockpit union called on pilots to go on strike for 24 hours starting at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) Wednesday. It was 
joined by the ver.di union, which called for flight attendants based in Germany to walk out all day Wednesday.
The walkouts were announced Monday evening. Ryanair on Tuesday urged pilots to show up to work, arguing that 
"since we have already offered local contracts and improved pay there is no justification for further disruption."
Last month, Ryanair pilots in several European countries staged a strike that prompted the budget carrier to cancel 
400 flights.
Ryanair said it would cancel 150 of 400 flights to and from Germany on Wednesday and that customers whose 
flight was cancelled would be getting an email notification. It is offering passengers a free move to flights between 
Thursday and Sunday. Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs apologized to customers and said that "we hate 
cancelling any flight."
It sharply criticized the short-notice walkout, saying that it "can only damage Ryanair's business and some of its 
bases in Germany, and may lead to aircraft and job cuts in the German market this winter."

Boeing Reports Increase in 737 Deliveries After Previous Delays Amid Supplier Issues
Boeing Reports Increase in 737 Deliveries After Previous Delays Amid 
Supplier Issues

 Boeing Company (BA) reported a rise in airplane deliveries in August compared with the previous month amid 
higher shipments of its popular 737 model after output faced previous delays over supplier issues. 
The company said it delivered a total of 64 planes to customers last month, up from 39 in July. For the narrow-body, 
single-aisle 737 model, deliveries increased to 48 from 29 in July. 
Planes were delivered to customers including American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), the US Navy and 
Ireland's Ryanair (RYAAY), according to data on the company's website. 
The higher number comes a week after the company's investor day, where analysts were focused on delays in the 
737 deliveries, according to a note after the meeting from Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert. He said 
Boeing's management focused on delays from Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) with the fuselage and CFM International's 
engines. 
It "highlighted that it views issues with other areas (APUs, PSUs, composite panels) as less of a concern," Herbert 
said. But he said in the Sept. 5 note that there's more near-term risk associated with the 737.
Boeing said it delivered eight wide-body 787 airplanes last month, unchanged from July. It sent out six of the 777 
models from one in the previous month and two of the 767 type versus one in July.  
For orders, Boeing had 99 in total last month compared with 25 in July. Airlines are looking for 90 737 planes, eight 
of the 787 model and one 777, the company said. That's compared with orders in July for 15 of the 737 type, five of 
the 777 and five of the 787.

       By Christian Ebner, dpa   FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - The first joint strike of Ryanair pilots and flight attendants 
will make it 'very difficult' for the budget airline to get flights off the ground in Germany on Wednesday, a 
spokesman for the German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said Tuesday.  VC spokesman Markus Wahl said 
the strike would take place in coordination with workers union Verdi. 
Some 400 pilots and 1,000 flight attendants are employed as part of Ryanair's German operations, and the majority 
of those could join the strike, he said.  The airline's Germany-based planes represents about one-tenth of its global 
fleet. Ryanair has not yet announced any cancellations for Wednesday, but a spokesman said the walk-outs were 
unjustified.  'Since we have already offered local contracts and better pay, there is no justification for further 
disruptions,' Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said Tuesday.  Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted 
in the cancellation of hundreds of flights this summer.  Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the 
Netherlands are among the other countries where Ryanair pilots and cabin staff have taken strike action.  More 
recently, unions have reached agreements with the budget airline. An Irish pilots union voted to accept an 
agreement with Ryanair last week, and the Italian pilots union ANPAC voted to approve a collective labour 
agreement two weeks ago.   Copyright dpa

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said on Tuesday that strikes by pilots and cabin crew in Germany would lead to job 
cuts if they continued.
"These threatened strikes can only damage Ryanair's business in Germany," it said in a statement, adding that 
secondary German bases would be particularly hit by any cuts.
Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Germany, represented by unions Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) and Verdi, are set to 
stage a full-day walkout on Wednesday as they seek better pay and terms.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, but secured a breakthrough in August 
when it reached a deal with Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could secure deals in other markets soon.
But last week, seven trade unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the 
Netherlands threatened to hold a strike in late September unless the airline agrees to improve working conditions.
Sweden's Air Line Pilots Association (SPF) is considering taking Ryanair to court and does not rule out further strike 
action, Chairman Martin Lindgren told Reuters on Tuesday.
The union objects to Ryanair's insistence that pilots be represented in negotiations by Ryanair staff or SPF staff not 
employed by a rival airline. Ryanair argues that EU competition rules prevent it from disclosing business secrets to 
union representatives employed by competitors, he said. (Reuters)

Ryanair revives Stansted traffic protest; Airline argues delays at airpo r t 
represent "blatant discrimination" in fresh grievance against NATS citing 
new data

Budget carrier Ryanair is again claiming air traffic control discrimination against London Stansted flights, submitting 
a new complaint to the European Commission and the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
The grievance came a year after a formal CAA investigation cleared air navigation service NATS of breaching 
licence conditions, after Ryanair and Stansted airport’s operator accused NATS of discriminating against Stansted 
flights and failing to provide adequate resources to manage traffic.
Ryanair’s latest complaint states that London Heathrow is “being given special treatment”, citing CAA data for the 
first quarter of 2018, which indicates that Stansted suffered 15,268min of air traffic control delays.
This figure included 13,420min attributed to air traffic control capacity, but just 31min linked to staffing.
Ryanair points out that the Stansted total accounts for 52% of the overall 29,289min of delays recorded across the 
five main London airports during the first quarter. The CAA data does not show any delays for Heathrow.
London Luton registered 8,814min of delays – some 30% of the total, and primarily due to capacity – while London 
Gatwick had 2,925min, the equivalent of 10%, all associated with staffing.
Ryanair stresses that British Airways and EasyJet, large operators at Heathrow and Gatwick, are also shareholders 
in NATS – although it neglects to point out that the UK low-cost airline is also a major operator at Luton.
Peter Bellew, Ryanair chief operating officer, claims that NATS is not rostering sufficient air traffic control personnel, 
particularly during weekends.
“These disruptions are unfair and unacceptable,” he says, adding that Ryanair is demanding “urgent action” and 
putting forward a formal complaint regarding “blatant discrimination” to the European Commission and CAA.
Ryanair revives Stansted traffic protest Airline argues delays at airpo r t represent "blatant discrimination" in 
fresh grievance against NATS citing new data
NATS says it does not discriminate between airlines or airports. It blames some of the delays on new technology, 
designed to allow more capacity in future, which was introduced at the turn of the year and affected a number of 
airports, including Stansted.
The CAA says its position on the matter has not changed since its ruling last year.
While the CAA ultimately rejected Ryanair’s and Stansted’s previous complaint, its inquiry did find that the NATS En 
Route division had made “significant” cuts to operational staffing, and that resilience had been weakened. There 
was no evidence, it added, of undue preference or discrimination.

Riverbed was final resting place for twinjet, which overran by 200m
Russian investigators have revealed that the Utair Boeing 737-800 involved in an overrun accident at Sochi on 1 
September came to rest 200m (656ft) from the end of the runway.
Federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia confirms that the aircraft aborted its initial approach owing to 
“unfavourable” weather conditions, and then overran as it landed on the second attempt.
Utair says the aircraft (VQ-BJI) suffered a landing-gear collapse before it came to a halt in a riverbed.
The narrowbody’s left-hand CFM International CFM56 engine ignited, the carrier adds; the blaze was subsequently 
extinguished, according to Russia’s emergency services ministry for the Krasnodar region.
The 737, arriving from Moscow Vnukovo in darkness, had been subjected to rain and strong wind gusts. 
Meteorological data from Sochi airport indicates that it had been experiencing thunderstorms and rain, and gusts 
exceeding 40kt (74km/h).
Shortly after the landing, the wind was blowing from the southwest, suggesting a tailwind for aircraft landing on 
runway 06, the weather data shows.
Rosaviatsia adds that, although there were no fatalities among the 166 passengers and six crew members, a 
department head of Sochi airport died during the rescue operation.
Utair says the captain of the 737 had logged over 14,000h, including nearly 5,400h on type; its first officer had 
similar levels of experience, with over 5,000h on type, from a total of more than 12,100h.

weather, with heavy rain and gusting wind repo r ted
The aircraft overran into the bed of the river Mzymta, which lies beyond the end of Sochi’s runway 06.
Rosaviatsia says the investigation is being conducted by a commission involving representatives from the aircraft 
manufacturer, the airport, and Utair.
Flight Fleets Analyzer lists VQ-BJI as a 16-year-old airframe, originally delivered to Ryanair, and also previously 
used by Moskva Airlines. It indicates that the jet is owned by SB Leasing Ireland.
Investigators have retrieved both the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders from the 737, which are in “satisfactory” 
condition, says the Interstate Aviation Committee.
A record of the accident is contained on both devices, and specialists have started to analyse the information, the 
agency has confirmed.

Laudamotion is to double the size of its fleet and offer staff improved pay as part of a growth strategy to be 
implemented by majority owner Ryanair.
Ryanair says the Vienna-based carrier’s aircraft will be increased from nine Airbus A320s to 18 next summer. A 
new livery will also be introduced, Ryanair adds.
Staff are to receive pay rises and basic-pay guarantees. These include a basic starting wage for captains of 90,000 
($104,000), rising to a maximum of 180,000.
An updated five-days-on, three-days-off winter roster is to be introduced and staff will be relocated within Austria’s 
capital.
Laudamotion chief executive Andreas Gruber states that the A320s will allow the airline to boost passenger 
numbers by 20%, to 5 million, in 2019 and welcomes the backing provided by the “enormous financial strength” of 
Ryanair.
The Irish carrier acquired just under 25% of Laudamotion earlier this year and in July gained regulatory approval to 
increase the stake to 75%.

Ryanair cabin crew unions threaten major strike in late September

Seven trade unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in five countries threatened on Friday to hold a strike in late 
September unless the airline agrees to improve working conditions.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, but secured a breakthrough in August 
when it reached a deal with striking Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could secure deals in other markets soon.
But on Friday unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands threatened in a 
joint letter to hold "the biggest strike action the company has ever seen" unless changes are made to their 
conditions.
The unions are demanding local contracts under local law rather than the Irish contracts, which Ryanair uses 
widely.
The seven unions - Italy's Uiltrasporti and FILT-CGIL, Portugal's SNPVAC, Belgium's CNE/LBC, Spain's SITCPLA 
and USO, and FVN in the Netherlands - issued the statement following a meeting in Rome.
They said the strike would take place in the last week of September and that a decision would be made by Sept. 13.
"We want to solve this. We don't want to strike," Fernando Gandra, director at Portuguese union SNPVAC told 
Reuters.
He said the two Italian unions also had pilot members and that the unions would invite pilots and ground staff 
across Europe to join in the strike.
Ryanair cabin crew unions threaten major strike in late September
Ryanair, which says its staff have better conditions than many low-cost rivals, did not immediately respond to a 
request for comment.
Ryanair confirmed earlier on Friday that it would reverse a decision made in July to move 20 percent of its Dublin-
based fleet to Poland due in part to the damage strike action was doing to bookings.
"The board and management of Ryanair are committed to union recognition, and working constructively with our 
people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter Ryanair’s low cost 
model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers," Ryanair’s Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said in a 
statement on the Dublin fleet plans.
The airline said it had informed 300 pilots and cabin crew in Dublin that it no longer expected their jobs would be 
lost.
Ryanair passengers have suffered hundreds of flight cancellations this summer because of protests by pilots over 
employment conditions. Pilots in Germany, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands went on strike on Aug. 
10 in the biggest one-day strike the Irish airline has faced. (Reuters)

Highlight: Paris-Beauvais Airport in France has renewed its contract with online parking reservation provider 
ParkCloud, after a four-year partnership.
Body
Under the renewed contract, ParkCloud will continue to provide its passengers with the option of pre-booking their 
parking at all three on-site car parks.The airport offers two short-term car parks, P1 and P2, for its 3.6 million annual 
passengers. Both facilities are fully secure and open air with CCTV in operation at all times.Located close to the 
terminal buildings, the P4 parking facility provides a cost-effective long-stay option for passengers flying from the 
airport for extended periods.ParkCloud managing director Mark Pegler said: “With direct road networks connecting 
the airport to the city of Paris, parking is a necessity for many travellers flying out of Paris-Beauvais, so pre-booking 
parking alongside their flight and other travel extras presents a convenient one-stop solution for travellers.“It’s our 
experience that airports are increasingly looking to address this consumer need to pre-plan and manage the 
journey process effectively; therefore it’s great to continue building upon partnerships with airports such as Paris-
Beauvais to deliver just that for our shared customer-base.”ParkCloud will utilise its existing database of over three 
million registered users and&nbsp;existing partnerships with Blue Air, Wizz Air and Ryanair to continue marketing 
its parking reservation options directly to airport passengers.Currently ParkCloud has official car park contracts with 
Lyon–Saint Exupéry, Nice C&ocirc;te d’Azur and Paris-Beauvais, three of France’s busiest airports.

A Ryanair pilot and three other industry veterans hope to raise at least $100m in Switzerland this week to launch a 
low-cost, long-haul airline that defies the economic forces that have grounded a series of small European carriers in 
recent months.
The new airline - as yet unnamed - will focus initially on serving North America, and expects to undercut larger, 
established carriers with a cut-price service from Basel airport, on Switzerland's border with France and Germany. 
The founders believe their business model will avoid the problems that hit other airlines.
Their move comes just weeks after the collapse of SkyWork airline, which served European destinations from Bern 
airport, Switzerland.
The past 18 months have also seen Air Berlin file for insolvency, the collapse of UK budget airline Monarch and of 
Belgium's VLM.
The Basel project - which has still to decide on its branding but is using the working title "Swiss Skies" - could 
launch in mid-2019 if its fundraising is successful. The airline expects to have a cost base 30 per cent lower than 
established network carriers and to be profitable in its third year - with margins comfortably in excess of industry 
averages.
Veterans plan Swiss long-haul budget airline Airlines
Alex Paterson, an analyst at Investec, said: "The [low-cost, long haul] models are less well tested but would 
suggest that if you can use new aircraft well and have an efficient cost base, it is possible to start with a niche and 
then grow."
As well as the US, the airline plans to add destinations in the Caribbean, Asia, Middle East and Brazil from a 
handful of European departure points. It does not, however, plan a UK operation because of the competitiveness of 
the country's airline industry - and the uncertainty created by Brexit.

Unions across Europe have threatened low-cost carrier Ryanair with a concerted strike by the end of this month if 
shareholders do not oust its directors.
Seven unions representing cabin crew, pilots and ground-handling staff from Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the 
Netherlands said they would announce the strike no later than September 13. In a letter yesterday, the combined 
unions demanded investors vote out Ryanair's board at its annual meeting on September 20 as it was "incapable of 
having meaningful talks with the unions".
In a separate letter, Ryanair's German pilots' union said it had given the airline until noon on Monday to enter into 
arbitration over its collective labour deal "to avoid further escalation in our conflict".
The unions received a boost from two shareholder advisory companies yesterday. ISS urged shareholders to vote 
against the re-election of four directors, including chairman David Bonderman, and Pirc opposed most of the 
directors, including chief executive Michael O'Leary. A third advisory company, Glass Lewis, had already 
recommended voting against Mr Bonderman.
Pirc said it had concerns about the company's gender pay gap (72 per cent, the worst in the industry) and criticised 
its "insufficient response" to a summer of industrial action, which had put shareholder value at stake.
Ryanair unions threaten concerted action Airlines ; Call to oppose re-election of directors backed by investor 
advisory firms
Last week, Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation, said: "In recent 
months Ryanair has shown its immaturity in industrial relations. At the end of last year [we] welcomed the prospect 
of a new era of co-operation ... Instead, we have seen the stalling, antagonism and underhanded tactics continue."
In a statement, Ryanair said that "shareholders will pass all AGM resolutions by a large majority, including the 
nomination of directors and chairman, as they have done in all previous years".
The carrier was hit by two days of action by Portuguese, Belgian and Spanish cabin crew unions, and a strike by 
pilots in five countries on August 10, forcing the airline to cancel 400 flights, or 15 per cent of its daily total.
The unions complain that Ryanair refuses to hire staff under local laws, with attendant rights and benefits; all staff 
are employed under Irish law.
There was some good news for Ryanair pilots yesterday as the carrier announced it would restore six aircraft to 
Dublin this winter, having threatened to move them to Poland if the airline's Irish pilots went on strike.
The pilots did strike but, after several days of mediation in August, the airline and their union reached an 
agreement.
Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's chief people officer, said the airline was "committed to union recognition and working 
constructively with our people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter 
Ryanair's low-cost model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers".

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said it has decided to restore six Dublin based 
aircraft which were due to transfer to Poland in November for the winter 2018 schedule. The related protective 
notices issued to 300 Dublin pilots and cabin crew in July have also been withdrawn today. 
The decision was taken to respond favourably to the mediation agreement overseen by Mr Kieran Mulvey, which 
brought an end to five days of unsuccessful but damaging strikes by less than 25% of Ryanair's Irish based pilots 
during July and August.   Ryanair's Chief People Office, Eddie Wilson, said, '....The Board of Ryanair today thanked 
independent mediator, Kieran Mulvey for his contribution in finalising an agreement between Ryanair and just 25% 
of our Irish pilots.  We regret that mediation became necessary after five days of unsuccessful strikes which, 
despite causing minimal damage to Ryanair's schedules, did damage our forward fares and yields to/from Ireland 
because of the perception of possible disruptions.'   Eddie Wilson, said, 'Since December last year, when the Board 
announced that we would recognise unions, Ryanair's people have enjoyed significant pay increases, improved 
terms and conditions, and we have agreed to improved seniority structures, base transfers and annual leave.  We 
have done this in a year when we expect profits to fall by 15% due to a combination of higher fuel prices and higher 
staff costs.'

The chief executive of low-cost carrier easyJet has suggested legislation might be needed to increase the number 
of female pilots from its current low level.
Speaking at the Aviation Festival in London, Johan Lundgren said targets could be useful, but "sometimes that is a 
slower process than some of the more aggressive methods like legislation".
According to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots, only 6.7 per cent of pilots are female, and the 
experiences of some women highlight disturbing discrimination.
Mr Lundgren added: "History shows that [legislation] is quite effective, but I would hope to see that there is enough 
awareness and knowledge about the fact that these things are the right things to do."
EasyJet has set a target to have women as 20 per cent of new entrant pilots by 2020. Currently only 6 per cent of 
its pilots are women. It also has a gender pay gap of 46 per cent, since most of its highest-paid employees are 
pilots, who are largely men.
At the same conference, Robin Hayes, chief executive of US low-cost airline JetBlue, said encouraging women into 
the industry was both right and financially necessary: "In the US we're going to face a shortage of maintenance

criticism over pay gap
technicians in the next 10 years ... Securing the supply of pilots and maintenance technicians is extremely important 
otherwise it becomes a constraint for airlines to grow."
Gender has been a live topic in aviation this year particularly since Akbar Al Baker, chief executive of Qatar 
Airways, said only a man could do his job. He later said he had meant that there was no particular woman ready to 
succeed him at Qatar, and apologised. When he made the comment, he had just been appointed chairman of the 
board of governors of the global airline trade association, the International Air Transport Association, which has only 
two women among its 30 members.
The aviation industry has a serious gender pay gap, with its highest earners, pilots, mostly men and its lowest 
earners, cabin crew, often women. Ryanair's most recently reported median hourly rate for women is 72 per cent 
lower than for men. Also at the conference, Mr Lundgren said he was not expecting Europe's air traffic control 
disruption, which has caused thousands of cancelled and delayed flights this summer, to improve in the short term.
He said Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates national ATC agencies, is "not giving you a great deal of hope that things 
will get better. Congestion is taking place and growth is happening to an extent that goes beyond what the 
infrastructure has been coping with."

 Ryanair (RYAAY) cabin crew across five countries threatened to strike in late September if the airline does not 
improve working conditions, Reuters reported Friday.
Seven trade unions, representing Ryanair cabin crew in Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain said in a 
joint letter to Ryanair  they will hold "the biggest strike action the company has ever seen" unless the airline makes 
significant changes to working conditions.The unions are also demanding local contracts for cabin crew, instead of 
Ryanair's widely used Irish contracts.
According to the unions, the strike will take place in the last week of September, following a decision that will have 
to be made on Sept. 13.
"We want to solve this. We don't want to strike," said Fernando Gandra, director at Portuguese union SNPVAC, to 
Reuters.

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - An Irish pilots union voted to accept an agreement with budget airline Ryanair on 
Wednesday, potentially ending a long-running labour dispute that resulted in several strikes this summer.  The Irish 
Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) said its members voted unanimously to accept the deal, which follows mediated 
negotiations between the two sides last month. 
 The pilots had objected to Ryanair's plans to change seniority rules and were unhappy with its procedures for 
annual leave, transfers and promotions.    The union said the deal could be 'the first step towards providing 
transparency and fairness for Ryanair pilots while also assisting Ryanair in recruiting and retaining pilots in the 
future.'  IALPA spokesman Joe May said: 'While our members fully respect Ryanair's operational model, they no 
longer accept the company's highly problematic employment model.'  The union accused Ryanair of attempted 
'union busting' in July after the airline warned that it could cut 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew from its staff in Ireland 
as it reduces its Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft over the winter.  In a statement on Wednesday, Ryanair 
welcomed the union's vote and said it would ask the company's board to 'reconsider their decision to re-base six 
aircraft away from Dublin this winter.'  Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of 
hundreds of flights this summer.  Italy, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are

Ryanair is set to scrap plans to reduce its fleet in Ireland after pilots there unanimously backed a deal negotiated by 
their trade union that provided a breakthrough in the airline's efforts to quell staff protests.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, but reached agreement on issues 
including transfers and promotions with the Irish union two weeks ago and said it was hopeful it could secure deals 
in other markets soon.
In a statement after the Forsa/IALPA union published the ballot result on Wednesday, Ryanair welcomed the vote 
and said it would ask its board to reverse a plan to reduce its Dublin fleet by six aircraft.
In July, Ryanair said it would reduce the winter fleet in its home base to 24 from 30, moving aircraft to its Polish 
airline, Ryanair Sun, which it said was enjoying rapid growth.
The fleet reduction threatened the jobs of over 100 Dublin pilots and more than 200 cabin crew who were issued 
with 90-day protective notices.
The board will meet to discuss the development in the coming days, it said.
After publishing details for the first time of the agreement it described as a "first step" towards providing fairness for 
pilots, the union said the flexibility on base transfers and promotions would end the "sole control" exercised 
previously by management over pilots' careers.

"While our members fully respect Ryanair's operational model, they no longer accept the company's highly 
problematic employment model. After decades of declining terms and conditions, pilots in Ryanair have now firmly 
found a unified voice," Captain Joe May, a spokesman for IALPA, said in a statement.
Ryanair shares were 1.3 percent lower at 13.59 euros by 1430 GMT. (Reuters)

BUDGET airline Ryanair cancelled 550 flights last month, affecting more than 100,000 customers, according to 
figures released yesterday.
Ryanair said a 24-hour pilot strike over pay and conditions that took place across Ireland, Germany, Sweden, 
Belgium and the Netherlands on 10 August and grounded 396 flights was to blame for the performance.
The low-cost carrier also said that a lack of Air Traffic Control (ATC) staff contributed to cancellations, which 
increased by 523 flights from just 27 in August last year.
However, August's customer traffic was up nine per cent year-onyear, from 12.7m to 13.8m.
Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: "Ryanair's August traffic grew by nine per cent to 13.8m 
customers, while our load factor was unchanged at 97 per cent, on the back of even lower fares.
"Regrettably, over 100,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in August because of repeated ATC staff 
shortages in the UK, Germany and France, and one day of unnecessary pilot strikes.
"Ryanair, together with other European airlines, calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and governments to 
correct these ATC staff shortages which are disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe's customers this 
summer."

Ryanair chairman David Bonderman is facing a growing threat of protest at the company's annual meeting as calls 
mount for shareholders to vote against his re-election.
The International Transport Workers' Federation and the European Transport Workers' Federation said yesterday 
that Mr Bonderman needed to be ousted to change what they called the company's "virulently anti-union" culture.
The federations joined Glass Lewis, a shareholder advisory company, which last week recommended that investors 
vote against Mr Bonderman as well as two other directors over governance concerns. It called on shareholders to 
vote against executive pay, suggesting the plan was poorly designed.
ISS, another advisory company, will deliver its verdict this week. The AGM will be held on September 20.
Mr Bonderman, who co-founded private equity business TPG, has been chairman of Ryanair since 1996. In 2017 
he stepped down from the board of Uber after making a sexist comment.
Ryanair has been involved in disputes with unions, leading to strikes. On August 10, Irish, German, Belgian, 
Swedish and Dutch pilots struck, forcing the airline to cancel 400 flights, 15 per cent of its daily total.
Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary, said: "In recent months Ryanair has shown its immaturity in industrial 
relations. At the end of last year, ITF, ETF and our affiliates welcomed the prospect of a new era of co-operation 
with the company. Instead, we have seen the stalling, antagonism and underhanded tactics continue."

Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.
Last year more than 10 per cent of investors voted against Mr Bonderman's re-election, after Glass Lewis, ISS and 
Pirc, another shareholder adviser, flagged concerns about the chairman.
This year Glass Lewis called for a vote against Mr Bonderman over his role as chair of the nominations committee 
in appointing Kyran McLaughlin, who advised Ryanair during its initial float on the Dublin and Nasdaq bourses in 
1997, as a senior independent director. The proxy adviser said Mr McLaughlin was "not considered independent".
"We believe that it is the responsibility of the chair of the nominations committee, who is consequently also the chair 
of the board, to appoint a truly independent senior independent director to ensure proper oversight," it said. Glass 
Lewis pointed to "poor disclosure" on pay, despite chief executive Michael O'Leary's decision to waive his bonus 
following the pilot rostering problems. "Shareholders should be concerned by the structure of the company's 
executive remuneration programme and the inadequacy of disclosure regarding several aspects of executive 
compensation," it said.
Ryanair decided to recognise some unions after more than 30 years when a scheduling crisis in September 2017 
forced it to cancel 2,000 flights. It had to pay (EURO)25m in compensation to passengers for the cancellations.
It signed a collective agreement with some of its Italian pilots, the first with any of its unions, in August. Its Irish 
pilots' union has agreed to ballot members on proposals regarding seniority, which determines pay, promotion and 
home bases. Irish pilots have staged five days of strikes so far this summer. See Notebook

 European markets ended Tuesday's session firmly in negative territory as traders were in a cautious mood due to 
continued worries over global trade. 
Recent reports have suggested that US President Donald Trump plans to move ahead with tariffs on USD200 
billion worth of Chinese imports as early as this week.
US and Canadian officials failed to reach an agreement on trade last week, with talks expected to resume this 
week. Trump threatened on Saturday that the US would go it alone with Mexico on a revised agreement or to 
terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement entirely.
"There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal," he tweeted, "If we don't make a fair deal 
for the US after decades of abuse, Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere with these negotiations or I 
will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off," he added.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.70%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 1.06%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 0.76%.
The DAX of Germany dropped 1.10% and the CAC of France fell 1.31%. The FTSE 100 of the UK declined 0.62% 
and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.57%.
In Frankfurt, wind turbines maker Nordex Group jumped 1.17% after winning an order for 99 MW project from 
Argentina.
In Paris, re-insurer Scor soared 9.53% after it rejected a friendly takeover offer by Covea.
In London, advertising giant WPP sank 6.27% after it expressed concern about underperforming operations in the 
US.
Low-cost airline Ryanair declined 2.44% after its August total traffic grew by 9% to 13.8 million customers.
European Markets Close Lower As Worries Continue Over Global Trade
DS Smith rose 0.12%. The cardboard packaging maker played down the impact of rising cost pressures in a trading 
update for the first quarter.
Banking firm ING Group NV tumbled 1.20% in Amsterdam after it agreed to pay a fine of 775 million euros to end a 
money-laundering probe by Dutch authorities.
Eurozone producer price inflation accelerated on energy prices in July, figures from Eurostat showed Tuesday. 
Producer prices advanced 4% year-on-year in July, following a 3.6% rise in June. Prices were expected to gain 
3.9% in July.
UK construction activity expanded at the weakest pace in three months in August largely mirroring lack of new work 
on infrastructure projects, survey data from IHS Markit showed Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell notably 
to 52.9 in August from July's 14-month peak of 55.8. The score was also below the expected 54.9.
UK like-for-like sales increased slightly in August, figures from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed 
Tuesday. Like-for-like sales rose slightly by 0.2% year-on-year in August. At the same time, total sales advanced 
1.3% annually.
Activity in the US manufacturing sector unexpectedly grew at a faster rate in the month of August, according to a 
report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index climbed to 61.3 in August from 58.1 in July, with a reading above 50 
indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected the index to dip to 57.7.
A report released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a modest uptick in construction spending in 
the US in the month of July. The Commerce Department said construction spending inched up by 0.1% to an 
annual rate of USD1.315 trillion in July after falling by 0.8% to a revised rate of USD1.314 trillion in June.
Economists had expected construction to rise by 0.5% compared to the 1.1% slump originally reported for the 
previous month.

August, figures from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed. Total sales advanced 1.3 percent annually.

Ryanair has accused Britain's air traffic control service of "blatant discrimination" against it and other airlines at 
Stansted airport as it announced it was submitting a complaint to the European Commission.
It highlighted figures from the Civil Aviation Authority showing that 52 per cent of air traffic delays at airports in 
London in the first quarter happened at Stansted, where Ryanair has its largest base and runs 65 per cent of the 
airport's services.
Luton airport had 30 per cent of the delays while Heathrow had none, prompting Ryanair to claim that NATS, the air 
traffic control manager, had given Heathrow "special treatment".
The carrier said it was submitting complaints to the European Commission and to the CAA to stir them into action, 
but it declined to provide a copy of the commission complaint.
Stansted said it was also considering making a complaint to the CAA about what it called the airport's 
"disproportionate share of ATC delays". It is not the first complaint Ryanair has filed with the commission in the past 
few months. In July, alongside IAG, easyJet and Wizz Air, it submitted a complaint saying the commission should 
act over French air traffic control strikes and shortages, claiming they breached "the fundamental principle of free 
movement within the EU".

Peter Bellew, Ryanair's chief operating officer, said: "We call on the UK Department for Transport and the European 
Commission to take urgent action to ensure that [NATS] is fully staffed and treats each London airport fairly. NATS 
don't have enough staff."
NATS said staffing numbers would not make a difference and the introduction of new technology, delivered at other 
airports too, had caused Stansted's problems.

Ryanair claims to be victim of 'blatant' air traffic control discrimination Airlines
Peter Bellew, Ryanair's chief operating officer, said: "We call on the UK Department for Transport and the European 
Commission to take urgent action to ensure that [NATS] is fully staffed and treats each London airport fairly. NATS 
don't have enough staff."
NATS said staffing numbers would not make a difference and the introduction of new technology, delivered at other 
airports too, had caused Stansted's problems.
"All airlines and airports were notified of the timetable in advance and understood the new technology will help us 
increase capacity safely in the future. NATS does not discriminate between airlines or airports."
In 2017, Gatwick airport suffered the most delays (34 per cent), with Stansted close behind (28 per cent). Last year 
Stansted had 26m passengers and 190,000 flights.
This is not the first time Ryanair has accused NATS of neglecting its duty.
In 2016, together with Stansted airport, it instigated an investigation by the CAA after saying NATS had "unduly 
preferred" certain airports, thus "preventing, restricting or distorting competition".
In its report, the CAA found "no evidence" of undue preference or discrimination but said NATS did need to take 
remedial action regarding staffing shortfalls. The CAA said it would consider any new complaint when it had been 
received.
Ryanair's first-quarter results showed air traffic control problems forced the airline to cancel more than 2,500 flights.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its August 
total traffic (which included Lauda traffic for the first time) grew by 9% to 13.8 million customers, while load factor 
was unchanged at 97%, on the back of even lower fares. Ryanair traffic grew 5% to 13.3 million customers with a 
97% load factor. Lauda traffic was 0.5 million customers with a 92% load factor.   Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said: 
'Regrettably, over 100,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in August because of repeated ATC staff 
shortages in the UK, Germany and France, and one day of unnecessary pilot strikes. Ryanair, together with other 
European airlines, calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and Governments to correct these ATC staff 
shortages which are disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe's consumers this summer.'  The Group noted 
that the ATC staff shortages and the pilot strike on 10 Aug caused almost 550 flight cancellations in August 
compared to 27 cancellations in August, 2017.

significant shareholder protest, the Financial Times reports.    Bonderman, who has been chairman for 22 years, 
was re-elected to the board with support of 70.5% of shareholders at the company’s annual meeting, the 
newspaper reports.
Chief executive officer Michael O’Leary said the “overwhelming” level of support for Bonderman’s re-election would 
make a politician happy. Still, he doubted whether the chairman would stay for another two years.   “He knows it 
won’t go on forever. We know it won’t go on forever,” O’Leary told reporters after the meeting.    “But frankly if we 
could encourage him to continue to chair the company for another couple of years, I personally would encourage 
him to do so. I don’t think he will.”   Bloomberg reported on 5 September that Bonderman was facing increasing 
opposition to his re-election. The ITF and ETF international labour groups and investor-advisory service Glass 
Lewis were separately lobbying against the reappointment of Bonderman, a long-time ally of chief executive officer 
Michael O’Leary and leader of the Ryanair board since 1996, the newswire adds.

All 170 occupants of a Utair Boeing 737-800 have escaped after the aircraft suffered severe damage during an 
overrun on landing at Sochi.
The aircraft, operating flight UT579 from Moscow, appears to have conducted a missed approach before landing on 
runway 06 just before 03:00 on 1 September.
Utair says the aircraft (VQ-BJI) suffered a runway excursion and its landing gear collapsed, before it came to a halt 
in a river bed.
The left-hand CFM International CFM56 engine ignited, the carrier adds.
Slides were deployed and all 164 passengers and six crew members were evacuated. Utair says all 170 on board 
survived the accident.
Meteorological data from Sochi airport indicates that it had been experiencing thunderstorms and rain, and wind 
gusts exceeding 40kt.
Weather data shortly after the landing indicates a wind direction from the south-west, suggesting a tailwind for 
aircraft landing on runway 06.
The Interstate Aviation Committee says it has established a commission to investigate the accident.
“As a result of the [excursion] and subsequent fire, the aircraft was seriously damaged,” it states.
NOTAM information issued for Sochi airport after the accident states that the ILS for runway 06/24 is now 
unserviceable as a result of emergency work in the critical area.
All on board survive Utair 737-800 excursion at Sochi;  E All 170 occupants of a Utair Boeing 737-800 have 
escaped after the aircraft suffered severe damage dur....
Russia’s emergency services ministry for the Krasnodar region says that it was informed of the accident at 02:59 
and that, by 03:15, the fire had been extinguished.
Flight Fleets Analyzer lists VQ-BJI as a 16-year old airframe, originally delivered to Ryanair, and also previously 
used by Moskva Airlines. It indicates that the jet is owned by SB Leasing Ireland.

If Britain leaves the European Union without an exit deal, airlines could struggle to raise fares, boost traffic and 
lower costs, ratings agency Moody’s has warned.
Nonetheless, Britain and Ireland’s largest carriers should weather any damage from a no-deal Brexit “even if flights 
are disrupted for an extended period” it has concluded.
British Airways, Ryanair and Easyjet should have the flexibility to survive a no-deal Brexit, although Moody’s warns 
that smaller airlines and those with weak liquidity could see their credit ratings downgraded.
“Broadly, an airline will be less exposed if it has a more flexible operating model and cost structure, greater network 
diversification and scale, and has begun to implement contingency measures,” Moody’s says.
The ratings agency identifies main risks from Britain exiting the European Union without a deal: a loss of traffic 
rights between the UK and the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA); a loss of traffic rights between the UK 
and countries that have aviation agreements with the EU, such as the US; meeting ownership and control 
conditions to retain valid operating licences; the UK's continued membership of the European Aviation Safety 
Agency; and weaker macroeconomic conditions.
“The probability of these risks occurring in a no-deal scenario and their effect on credit quality will differ depending 
on the political willingness and economic incentives to separate a no-deal Brexit from aviation agreements, as well 
as contingency plans and past exceptions to rules or regulations,” notes Moody’s.
Earlier this week the British government said that flights would probably continue even in the event of no deal.

Laudamotion is to double the size of its fleet next year, introduce a new livery, and offer staff improved pay as part 
of a growth strategy to be implemented after Ryanair closed its acquisition of a 75% stake in the Austrian regional 
carrier.
Ryanair says the Vienna-based carrier's fleet will grow from nine Airbus A320s today to 18 next summer. A new 
livery which "reflects Laudamotion's Austrian heritage" will also be introduced, Ryanair adds.
Laudamotion
Staff are to receive pay rises and basic-pay guarantee". These include a basic starting wage for captains of 90,000 
($104,000), rising to a maximum of 180,000. First officers will get basic pay of 46,000, rising to a maximum of 
70,000, including flight pay.
A new five-days-on, three-days-off winter roster is to be introduced and staff will be relocated to new offices within 
Austria's capital. Christian Rolle has been appointed as the airline's personnel director and will take up his new role 
on 1 September.
Laudamotion chief executive Andreas Gruber states that the new A320s will allow the airline to boost passenger 
numbers 20% to five million in 2019 and welcomes the backing provided by the "enormous financial strength" of 
Ryanair.
The Irish carrier acquired just under 25% of Laudamotion earlier this year and in July gained regulatory approval to 
increase the stake to 75%.

Ryanair signs labour accord with Italian pilots Airlines

Ryanair has signed a collective labour agreement with some of its Italian pilots, the first with any of its unions, after 
this summer's strikes.
Italy has the budget carrier's thirdlargest group of pilots, about 830, a fifth of the total - of whom about a third are 
represented by the Anpac union.
Ryanair said it welcomed the agreement and hoped it would be followed shortly by a deal with its Irish pilots.
"We have invited our UK, German and Spanish unions to meet with us in the coming days so that we can negotiate 
and hopefully agree similar pilot CLAs in these other larger markets," it said.
"These agreements demonstrate the real progress being made by Ryanair in its negotiations with its pilots and their 
unions across different EU markets."
One analyst said Ryanair was "playing divide and conquer quite well", given there are two other Italian pilot unions. 
It could also put pressure on other restive unions across Europe. It is a second piece of good news for the airline 
after its Irish pilots' union last week agreed to ballot its members on proposals regarding seniority, which determines 
pay, promotion and home bases. Irish pilots have staged five days of strikes this summer.
Kathryn Leonard, analyst at Numis, said progress was "clearly welcome" but until the details of the Italian and Irish 
agreements became public, it would be hard to tell what their long-term effects were on costs.
Ryanair signs labour accord with Italian pilots Airlines
Ryanair has been beset by pilot and cabin crew strikes this summer. On August 10, Irish, German, Belgian, 
Swedish and Dutch pilots took industrial action, forcing the airline to cancel 400 flights, or 15 per cent of its daily 
total.
The employees' demands have centred on improved pay and terms, including seniority, and (for non-Irish staff) the 
application of national, not Irish, law to govern contracts.
At a meeting in Frankfurt last week, unions from across Europe agreed to further strike action but did not announce 
a date.
The company decided to recognise some unions after more than 30 years when a scheduling crisis in September 
2017 forced it to cancel 2,000 flights. It had to pay (EURO)25m in compensation to passengers for the 
cancellations.

Ryanair has signed a collective labour agreement with some of its Italian pilots, the first with any of its unions, after 
this summer's strikes.
Italy has the budget carrier's thirdlargest group of pilots, about 830, a fifth of the total - of whom about a third are 
represented by the Anpac union.
Ryanair said it welcomed the agreement and hoped it would be followed shortly by a deal with its Irish pilots.
"We have invited our UK, German and Spanish unions to meet with us in the coming days so that we can negotiate 
and hopefully agree similar pilot CLAs in these other larger markets," it said.
"These agreements demonstrate the real progress being made by Ryanair in its negotiations with its pilots and their 
unions across different EU markets."
One analyst said Ryanair was "playing divide and conquer quite well", given there are two other Italian pilot unions. 
It could also put pressure on other restive unions across Europe. It is a second piece of good news for the airline 
after its Irish pilots' union last week agreed to ballot its members on proposals regarding seniority, which determines 
pay, promotion and home bases. Irish pilots have staged five days of strikes this summer.
Kathryn Leonard, analyst at Numis, said progress was "clearly welcome" but until the details of the Italian and Irish 
agreements became public, it would be hard to tell what their long-term effects were on costs.
Ryanair signs labour accord with Italian pilots Airlines
Ryanair has been beset by pilot and cabin crew strikes this summer. On August 10, Irish, German, Belgian, 
Swedish and Dutch pilots took industrial action, forcing the airline to cancel 400 flights, or 15 per cent of its daily 
total.
The employees' demands have centred on improved pay and terms, including seniority, and (for non-Irish staff) the 
application of national, not Irish, law to govern contracts.
At a meeting in Frankfurt last week, unions from across Europe agreed to further strike action but did not announce 
a date.
The company decided to recognise some unions after more than 30 years when a scheduling crisis in September 
2017 forced it to cancel 2,000 flights. It had to pay (EURO)25m in compensation to passengers for the 
cancellations.

The Italian pilots union ANPAC has voted to approve a collective labour agreement reached with low-cost airline 
Ryanair following a protracted a labour dispute, both sides have announced.
The more than 300 members of Italy's largest airline pilots union approved the agreement by a large majority on 
Monday evening, the union said on Tuesday.
ANPAC called the deal an "historic event," and "the first collective agreement signed by Ryanair in Europe."
Italy is one of the Irish airline's largest markets.
The agreement, reached after eight months of negotiations and signed in Italy, ensures better protection and pay 
conditions for pilots, the union said.
Ryanair said it hopes to sign a similar deal with its Irish pilots in the near future. The airline reached an agreement 
with Irish pilots' union Forsa this week, but the pilots still have to vote to approve the deal.
Strikes by Ryanair pilots across Europe have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights during the past two 
months.
Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are among the other countries that have 
mounted strike actions.
Ryanair only started recognizing pilots unions last year, taking the step during negotiations to ward off a previous 
threat of strikes.

The company said on Tuesday that it has invited unions in Britain, Germany and Spain to negotiate in the coming

had voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new Collective Labor Agreement (CLA) which was negotiated and signed 
between Ryanair and ANPAC (Italian Airline Pilots Association) on August 9 last. Italy accounts for 20 percent of 
ryanair's fleet and pilots.  This is the first pilot CLA in one of its largest EU markets. The vote in Italy comes shortly 
after Irish union FORSA signed, and recommended, a mediation agreement to Ryanair's Irish pilots, who are 
currently voting to approve this agreement.

Aug 24, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Prince Charles 
no longer has to travel with his passport when he becomes king. In the United Kingdom, passports are issued in the 
name of the monarch. 
This means that they are currently given by Queen Elizabeth II. Since she is the head of the state, the Queen 
doesn't travel with her passport. 'Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State requests and requires in the name of 
Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance and to afford 
the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary,' the statement on the British passport read. When 
Prince Charles takes over the throne, he will no longer need to travel with the document. However, Prince Charles' 
wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, still cannot travel without her passport. Kara Godfrey, a journalist for Express[1], said 
that even though Prince Charles no longer needs his passport when traveling, he might still be asked some 
questions whenever he flies in and out of the country. These can include questions about his age and address for 
security purposes. In related news, Prince Charles is known as one of the royals that go all out during his trips. It 
was revealed that he spent over $1.5 million[2] on his travels last year. He also travels via his private jet. His most 
expensive tour was of India, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore. Prince Charles' sons, Prince William and Prince 
Harry are not like him because the siblings get to travel on commercial flights. In fact, Prince Harry has also 
traveled with Meghan Markle[3] on a commercial flight. In 2015, Prince William flew by Ryanair to Scotland, and an 
eyewitness said that it was refreshing to see a member of the royal family taking a cheap flight. Prince William was 
joined by his bodyguard at that time. In 2011, he also traveled on economy class with Kate Middleton. Prince 
Charles no longer needs a passport when traveling to other countries when he becomes king. Pictured: Prince

Ryanair hopes for end to strikes after reaching deal with Irish pilots' union

Ryanair and its Irish pilots' union have announced an agreement on their labour contract, potentially bringing to an 
end a summer of strikes.
After several days of mediation, Forsa trade union said it would recommend that its members accept the agreement 
when it goes to a ballot.
Ryanair said it would take the proposals to its board "in due course after the Irish-based pilots have voted on this 
signed agreement".
The company's shares closed 5.9 per cent higher at (EURO)13.92 yesterday.
In an email to its members seen by the Financial Times, the union said it had reached a tentative agreement on two 
issues regarding "seniority" - which determines a pilot's pay, promotion and home bases - while it was still in 
discussions on annual leave.
Joost van Doesburg of the Dutch VNV pilots' union, which has also gone on strike this summer, said: "We still have 
some questions, because is it a national Irish seniority list - that would be in our opinion quite useless - or will this 
be a master seniority list for all Ryanair pilots in Europe? Then it would be a very positive intermediate step."
Ryanair hopes for end to strikes after reaching deal with Irish pilots' union
Forsa's members, who account for about a third of Ryanair's Irish pilots, have gone on strike five times this 
summer, most recently on August 10, when they were joined by pilots from Germany, Belgium, Sweden and the 
Netherlands. The airline was forced to cancel 400 flights, or 15 per cent of its daily total.
Ryanair pilots' unions met in Frankfurt on Monday to discuss further strike action, with one person at the meeting 
saying a new strike had been agreed, with a date to be confirmed.
The person said: "The countries that were in the meeting ... are still in strike mode instead of negotiation mode."
The person added that the Irish agreement might give Ryanair more time to concentrate on its disputes with other 
unions, which want to discuss pay increases and the use of national, rather than Irish, law for employment 
contracts. Neither was an issue for Irish pilots.

 Stocks in London ended mixed on Thursday, as a fall in heavyweight mining stocks impeded gains in the FTSE 
100, as the US and China's tit-for-tat trade war intensified.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2%, or 11.02 points at 7,563.22. The FTSE 250 ended up 0.1%, or 22.97 
points, at 20,665.47, and the AIM All-Share closed up 0.1%, or 7.75 points, at 1,092.55.
The Cboe UK 100 closed down 0.2% at 12,818.30, the Cboe UK 250 closed up 0.2% at 18,771.98, and the Cboe 
UK Small Companies closed down 0.1% at 12,330.33.
"Despite briefly spiking above 7,600, the FTSE 100 was unable to retain its strength and moved into negative 
territory towards the end of the session. An escalation of trade tensions between the US and China hit metal prices 
pulling miners lower," said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta.
China retaliated in the same measure against the US government's decision to impose 25% import duty on 
additional Chinese products worth USD16 billion, escalating a trade war between the two economic powerhouses.
The US has applied new tariffs to a vast range of goods in 279 product categories, including children's cots and 
bedding, animal medicines, semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, shrimps and shrimp 
products, handbags and fridges.
China responded immediately with tariffs on 333 US products worth USD16 billion. They include coal, copper scrap, 
fuel, buses, cars, medical equipment, Harley motorcycles, bourbon and orange juice.
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tried to downplay the counter-effects in an interview on CNBC.
"Naturally they'll retaliate a little bit. But at the end of the day, we have many more bullets than they do. They know 
it," Ross said.

On the London Stock Exchange, miners were weighing on the large cap index with Anglo American, down 2.7%, 
Antofagasta, down 1.0% and Rio Tinto down 1.0%. 
Imperial Brands and Carnival closed down 1.8% and 1.1% respectively after the stocks went ex-dividend meaning 
new buyers no longer qualify for the latest dividend payout. 
In the FTSE 250, TalkTalk Telecom Group ended as the best performer, up 8.4% after Barclays upgraded the home 
phone and broadband provider to Overweight from Equal Weight saying its operating trends are set to improve 
following years of losing market share. 
Elsewhere, Ryanair Holdings closed up 5.5% after the Irish carrier reached an agreement with its Irish pilot union in 
a labour dispute, both sides have announced.
"Following a 22-hour negotiating session, which began on Wednesday morning and concluded Thursday morning, 
agreement has been reached between Forsa and Ryanair in the pilots' dispute," the pilots' trade union Forsa said.
The pilots now have to vote to approve the deal, with the union recommending that they accept it. In the dispute 
over holiday time, transfers and promotions, 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots took part in five days of strike 
action.
Elsewhere, the Saudi government remains committed to an initial public offering of the state oil giant Aramco, but at 
a "time of its own choosing," Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said. His remarks come in response to speculation that 
Saudi authorities called off plans to list the company on the stock exchange, expected to be one of the biggest in 
history. 
The Aramco listing is thought to be part of an ambitious economic reform plan, known as Vision 2030, launched by 
Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the kingdom's oil-reliant economy. 
"The government remains committed to the IPO of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are 
optimal," Aramco chairman Al Falih said in a statement, according to the official Saudi news agency SPA. 
The pound was lower against the dollar quoted at USD1.2830 at the London equities close, compared to 
USD1.2906 at close Wednesday. Sterling hit an intraday high of USD1.2917 in afternoon trade before giving back 
gains. 
In domestic political news, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated the UK government's conviction that it can and 
will agree a deal with the EU.
Raab told reporters that plans were being made to recruit an extra 9,000 staff into the civil service to deal with 
Brexit, in addition to 7,000 currently working on preparations.
A further 1,000 more Border Force staff are to be recruited, more than triple the additional 300 previously planned 
for. Raab dismissed "misinformation" about what may happen in the event no deal is reached by March, saying his 
stress levels were "fine".
The government published 24 technical papers setting out preparations and scenarios that could play out if a Brexit 
deal cannot be agreed before Britain leaves the EU in March.
The key points from the first set of papers cover several aspects of British life and trade including the removal of an 
EU ban on credit and debit card surcharges. UK citizens living in Europe facing the possibility of losing access to 
their pensions and consumers facing a potential cost increase for shopping online.
"The game of poker between the UK and EU goes on, but it is clear that the UK's journey after a 'no deal' will be 
much harder than the EU's. With this in mind, the pound was a little jittery, but the references to 'progress' in Raab's 
speech helped to calm the currency for a brief period before the US economic strength-related selling resumed," 
said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp.

On the economic front, UK retailers reported an above-average sales growth in the year to August but the outlook 
was less positive with declines in employment, investment intention and business optimism, a closely watched 
survey showed Thursday.
A net balance of 29% said their sales volumes increased in August, according to the latest quarterly Distributive 
Trades Survey from the Confederation of British Industry. However, the balance for the next month fell to 22%.
Further, a net 8% of retailers expected their overall business situation to deteriorate slightly over the next three 
months.
In Paris the CAC 40 ended flat while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.1%. 
The euro was a touch lower against the dollar at USD1.1569 at the European equities close, against USD1.1599 
late Wednesday. 
In economic news from the continent, the euro area private sector continued to expand in August, albeit with the 
rate of expansion remaining one of the weakest seen over the past 18 months, flash data from IHS Markit showed.
The composite output index rose marginally to 54.4 in August from 54.3 in July. But the score was slightly below the 
forecast of 54.5.
The services Purchasing Managers' Index also came in at 54.4, up from 54.2 a month ago. The score came in line 
with expectations.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing PMI fell unexpectedly to a 21-month low of 54.6 from 55.1 in July. The reading was 
expected to rise slightly to 55.2.
Within the eurozone, growth accelerated in France and Germany but slowed across the rest of the single-currency 
area.
Stocks in New York were lower at the London equities close. The DJIA was down 0.4%, the S&P 500 index down 
0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.1%.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump dodged a question in an interviewed broadcast Thursday about pardoning 
his one-time campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was convicted this week on federal tax and bank fraud 
charges.
Without saying whether he is weighing a pardon, Trump minimized the charges against Manafort, 69, who faces 
decades in prison.
"I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's gone through," Trump told Fox News, a cable channel 
that he frequently praises.
"I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in 
Washington probably does."
Brent oil was firm quoted at USD74.56 a barrel at the London equities close from USD74.26 at the close 
Wednesday. 
Gold was lower quoted at USD1,189.30 an ounce at the London equities close against USD1,195.95 late 
Wednesday.

sent its shares sharply higher as the budget airline strives to quell staff protests around Europe.
Ryanair passengers have suffered hundreds of flight cancellations this summer because of protests by pilots over 
slow progress in negotiating collective labor agreements, hurting average fares at Europe's largest low-cost carrier.
The Irish airline endured its worst one-day strike earlier in August after a walk-out by pilots in five European 
countries disrupted the plans of an estimated 55,000 people at the height of the summer holiday season.
That included a fifth 24-hour walkout of the summer by around a quarter of its pilots in Ireland that prompted 
Ryanair to propose fresh talks with the help of a mediator that began last week and ended early on Thursday after a 
22-hour session.
"The proposed agreement will now go to ballot, with a recommendation for acceptance from Forsa and its Ryanair 
pilot representatives," pilots' union Forsa said in a statement on Thursday, adding the talks' mediator asked that 
neither side makes further comment while the ballot is conducted.
Ryanair said it would take the proposals to its board after the Irish-based pilots had voted on the agreement.
Some of the other trade unions stuck in negotiations around Europe have said they are watching the Irish talks 
closely.
Ryanair employs more than 4,000 pilots, with around 350 of them based in Ireland. Negotiations in the country have 
been among the most difficult, the company has said.
Ryanair reaches agreement with Irish union in pilots dispute
Shares in Ryanair were 5.4% higher at 13.855 euros at 0815 GMT, top of the regional STOXX 600 benchmark 
index.
The stock is still down 16% since the strike action ramped up in mid-July and remains below the 14.21 euros it 
slumped to in December when Ryanair shocked markets by agreeing to recognize unions for the first time in its 30-
year history. (Reuters)

Low-cost airline Ryanair has reached an agreement with its Irish pilots in a labour dispute, both sides have 
announced.
"Following a 22-hour negotiating session, which began on Wednesday morning and concluded Thursday morning, 
agreement has been reached between Forsa and Ryanair in the pilots' dispute," the pilots' trade union Forsa said 
on Thursday.
Ryanair confirmed the agreement to dpa, without giving details.
The pilots now have to vote to approve the deal, with the union recommending that they accept it.
"The mediator ... has asked both sides to refrain from further comment until the ballot has concluded and we will 
respect his wishes," Ryanair said.
In the dispute over holiday time, transfers and promotions, 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots took part in five 
days of strike action.
The Irish airline is in dispute with trade unions in several EU countries, which came to a head in mid-August with the 
biggest pilots' strike in Ryanair's history that affected 55,000 passengers across Europe.
German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) told dpa that it wants to wait and analyse the outcome of the 
agreement between Ryanair and its Irish pilots before continuing to negotiate with Ryanair.
"It poses the question whether mediation could come into consideration in Germany too," said VC Vice President 
Markus Wahl.

A further round of negotiations between the discount carrier and VC hasn't been started since the mid-August 
strike.
VC is asking for better pay, among other things, but Ryanair is wary of making agreements that would put its low-
cost business model at risk.
German labour union Verdi is also negotiating with Ryanair regarding better pay. Additionally it is fighting for 
measures against temporary work and short-term staff relocations.

While Europe has lost its share of established carriers over the last decade, none has been bigger than the collapse 
of Air Berlin last autumn.
The group and its subsidiary carriers, notably Austrian leisure unit Niki, at its peak carried over 35 million 
passengers annually. Its network included routes serving some of the most in-demand holiday markets in Europe.
Little wonder, then, that there should be no shortage of suitors to step into those markets.
Lufthansa, EasyJet, Level, Wizz Air, Condor and Ryanair – together with its new partner Laudamotion – are all 
among those to have moved into the space vacated by Air Berlin. Many of those acquired assets from 
administrators of the disparate group in order to help stake claims in these markets.
But such is the competition and expansion costs, that there are some early growing pains for some of these 
operations. Ryanair – which is taking a majority share in Laudamotion – has flagged that the unit faces a "difficult" 
first year and will not reach break even until its third year of operations. Lufthansa described the first half as "very 
busy and stressful" for Eurowings.
EasyJet cited costs related to its expansion into Tegel and integration of Air Berlin assets after sliding to a first-half 
loss. Despite boosting its full-year outlook after a strong third quarter, the UK carrier deepened its projection of 
losses related to its Berlin operations as a result of weaker yields from additional capacity in this market.
Indeed, attempts by German consultancy SBC to get Air Berlin's former Swiss charter operation Belair back in the 
sky fell flat when prospective investors pulled out, prompting the carrier to file for insolvency in August.
ANALYSIS: How Air Berlin capacity has been replaced While Europe has lost its share of established carriers 
over the last decade, none has been bigger than the ....
Air Berlin had already reduced its operations on in its own behalf, even before its financial problems caught up with 
it. Most notably that included a wet-lease tie-up with German rival Lufthansa, covering 30 Airbus narrowbodies 
operating under the Eurowings umbrella.
In September 2017, prior to its cessation of flights the following month, Air Berlin had around 1.8 million seats in the 
market under its own brand, FlightGlobal schedules data shows. Niki had just shy of a million seats in the market 
during the same month.
Air Berlin's flying was split across a number of bases in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to a wide range of 
destinations. That was also the case with Niki, but much of its flying was focused on serving Palma de Mallorca 
from these various points.
BERLIN
That capacity, at least at its largest base Berlin Tegel, has been more than replaced by other carriers in the year 
since.
Air Berlin and Niki combined offered 575,000 seats in September 2017. FlightGlobal schedules data for the same 
month this year shows that overall seat capacity has risen 8.7%.
EasyJet, which had already been active at Berlin Schonefeld airport, is now the biggest operator at Tegel after 
acquiring slots and assets from Air Berlin's administrators. It began flights from Tegel at the start of the year and 
this September will operate more than 50 routes from the airport. These include its first German domestic routes.
While integration costs have been higher than expected, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren told FlightGlobal 
in July that "we always knew that the first few months was going to be difficult commercially, because we were 
basically inheriting a flawed schedule". As an example, he cites the "seven or eight" dailies EasyJet is currently 
flying between Berlin and Frankfurt. "But we need to fly them to get the slots," he points out.
The aim for EasyJet is to become "the Berliners' airline", he adds. At Tegel, EasyJet's pan-European credentials 
are manifesting themselves in "good sales coming not only out from Berlin but also [inbound], which Air Berlin didn't 
have".
Eurowings too has rapidly stepped up its presence at the airport, even after accounting for the transfer of the 
remaining Germanwings operations switched to the Eurowings brand. Other carriers within Lufthansa Group – 
Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Lufthansa mainline – have also all increased their seat capacity out of Tegel.
While the lion's share of Tegel capacity was operated by Air Berlin, Niki also had a small presence at Tegel. After a 
protracted sale process, the assets of Niki were ultimately picked up by the carrier’s founder – Niki Lauda – through 
Laudamotion. Lauda quickly struck a deal to sell the majority of the carrier to Ryanair – a move cleared in July – 
and the new operation gives the Irish carrier a foothold at Tegel.
Ryanair began its first Tegel flights in its own right – a daily service to Palma de Mallorca – in June. The carrier's 
Berlin operations until now have been focused on the city’s Schonefeld airport.
VIENNA
If much of the initial focus of attention following Air Berlin's collapse was on Tegel, Vienna has more recently been 
the key market. While the Austrian capital accounted for a relatively small amount of Air Berlin and Niki's seats in 
September 2017, combined they were the third biggest provider of capacity at Vienna.
FlightGlobal schedules data shows, thought, that seat capacity is running 11% higher this September out of Vienna 
than in the same month last year, with much of the new capacity driven by low-cost carriers.
ANALYSIS: How Air Berlin capacity has been replaced While Europe has lost its share of established carriers 
over the last decade, none has been bigger than the ....
IAG's interest in developing low-cost operations at Vienna were already clear after it bid – initially successfully – for 
the assets of Niki with a view to establishing a new operation related to budget unit Vueling.
After missing out on Niki, IAG in July launched a new Austrian-based low-cost carrier under its Level brand, using 
four Airbus A321 narrowbodies sourced from Air Berlin.
The new short-haul subsidiary has an Austrian air operator's certificate and now operates 14 routes out Vienna – 
around half of which are to Spanish destinations.
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that Lufthansa subsidiary Austrian Airlines will be a competitor on eight of the 
routes – three of which are also operated by Eurowings.
Wizz and Laudamotion had already activated new bases at Vienna this summer, while EasyJet has doubled its seat 
capacity out of the Austrian city – including three new routes, notably a high-frequency Tegel connection.
Lufthansa, though, is "well prepared" for the arrival of additional competition at Vienna airport, argues the airline 
group's finance chief Ulrik Svensson.
Briefing analysts at the end of July, Svensson acknowledged "a large gathering of many competitors" at the 
Austrian capital's gateway but added that this was "nothing which is new for us". He notes that the German carrier 
faces increased competition at its Frankfurt base.
Svensson says customers appreciate the "very good product" offered by Austrian Airlines. He cites the Lufthansa 
subsidiary's "high frequencies" from Vienna.
Wizz and Laudamotion activated new bases at Vienna this summer, while IAG budget carrier subsidiary Level 
began short-haul European flights from there earlier this month.
Earlier in July, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned of "price wars" at Vienna this winter.
DUSSELDORF, MUNICH AND ZURICH
Air Berlin was the second-biggest operator in terms of seat capacity at Munich airport at the time of its collapse. 
Again, the airport has been able to more than withstand the loss of the carrier as seat capacity is 2% higher this 
September than the same month in 2017, FlightGlobal schedules data shows.
Lufthansa, the biggest operator at the airport by a distance, and Eurowings have both expanded rapidly. Eurowings 
has doubled its seat capacity, factoring in its takeover of some formerly Germanwings-marketed services, and is 
now the second-biggest carrier at Munich.
EasyJet has also doubled its seat capacity at Munich, while Ryanair and Laudamotion have added their first flights 
from the German airport, serving Dublin and Palma de Mallorca respectively.
Seat capacity this September is also fractionally higher at Zurich, another airport that featured prominently within Air 
Berlin and Niki's flight schedules.
Lufthansa Group carrier Swiss has increased its seat capacity by the highest amount since then. Eurowings – 
having taken on the former Germanwings routes connecting the Swiss city with Cologne, Dusseldorf and Hamburg 
– has also added capacity to these services.
The addition of high-frequency connection from Tegel and a new Porto service mean that EasyJet has raised its 
Zurich capacity by more than half, even with the ending of its Hamburg flight in March.
Dusseldorf was Air Berlin's second-largest airport by seat capacity in September 2017. It is the only one of the 
carrier's major bases at which seat capacity is down this September than in 2017, FlightGlobal schedules data 
shows.
ANALYSIS: How Air Berlin capacity has been replaced While Europe has lost its share of established carriers 
over the last decade, none has been bigger than the ....
Eurowings is now comfortably the biggest operator at Dusseldorf. It has increased its seat capacity 50% since 
September 2017, which includes the switching of some remaining Germanwings flights.
Thomas Cook unit Condor has doubled its presence at Dusseldorf and is now the second-biggest operator at the 
airport. It has raised frequency across the majority of its network from Dusseldorf, most notably to Palma de 
Mallorca. Thomas Cook had also grown through assets from the old Air Berlin operation, acquiring the Air Berlin 
Aviation subsidiary in early January to help fuel its development at the airport.
EasyJet has made its debut at the airport with the domestic link from Tegel. Laudamotion has launched a dozen 
routes from Dusseldorf, of which more than half the seat capacity is deployed to Palma de Mallorca.
That Spanish island destination was at the heart of the former Niki schedules and remains a key destination in the 
leisure sector from the region. Seat capacity into Palma de Mallorca from Germany, Austria and Switzerland 
combined has climbed 8%, FlightGlobal schedules data for September shows.

Low-cost carrier Ryanair has left some customers owed compensation shortchanged after it sent them unsigned 
cheques they were unable to cash.
Ryanair said that an "admin error" had resulted in a "tiny number of cheques" - fewer than 190 out of more than 
20,000 compensation cheques in July - being posted without a required signatory.
Passenger Gordon Fong tweeted this month that he had received a cheque quickly but his bank had rejected it 
because it was not signed.
The BBC, which first revealed the claims, reported at least 10 other instances of unsigned cheques. The airline said 
the affected cheques had been reissued last week and apologised to customers for inconvenience caused.
Ryanair passengers have been beset by delays and cancellations in the past year. The airline cancelled more than 
2,000 flights in September 2017 after a rostering problem left it short of pilots, costing it (EURO)25m in 
compensation.
In the second quarter of this year, strikes and shortages of air traffic controllers led to 2,500 flights being cancelled, 
affecting 450,000 passengers. And Ryanair pilots and cabin crew have been staging industrial action all summer in 
a dispute over pay, conditions and employment contracts. On August 10, pilots from Ireland, Germany, Belgium, 
Sweden and the Netherlands went on strike, forcing the airline to cancel 400 flights.
Ryanair error shortchanges some passengers Airlines
In the event of a significant delay or outright cancellation within the airline's control, passengers are entitled to 
compensation under EU rules. For a flight of 1,500km or less, the compensation is (EURO)250. It rises to 
(EURO)600 under certain conditions. Air traffic control strikes are not generally covered by EU regulations.
Ryanair is not the only airline that has been hit with increased compensation claims. IAG, which owns British 
Airways and low-cost Vueling, paid out 3 per cent more in compensation costs in the first half of 2018 because of 
air traffic control strikes, which "significantly impacted" Vueling's operations.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair and one of Ireland's main unions have struck an agreement following a 22-hour 
negotiating session, paving the way for a ballot of pilots engaged in a long-running dispute with the airline.
Neither side wished to comment on the agreement struck after the marathon session that started Wednesday 
morning and ended Thursday morning.
The budget airline and pilots have wrangled over working conditions, base transfers and annual leave, resulting in 
five days of strikes by Irish pilots last month.
The Forsa union says the proposed deal will now go to a vote "with a recommendation for acceptance," while 
Ryanair said it would "take these proposals to its board in due course."
The airline has faced a barrage of strike actions since agreeing to recognize unions last year.

Last month, Europe's airline passengers experienced more than 135,000 minutes of in-flight delays on average 
each day. Put another way, that is 94 days' worth of delays every day - more than double the year before.
Strikes and a lack of capacity were the main cause of the troubles, said Eurocontrol, which compiled the data and is 
responsible for the safety of air navigation in Europe. In France, air traffic controllers took frequent industrial action, 
which meant aircraft were often unable to fly over the country.
Indeed, this summer's delays highlight structural problems afflicting the European airline sector.
Ryanair has been a notable casualty, but delays and disruption have hit all the main carriers, such as IAG, easyJet 
and Air France-KLM. For the companies, the reputational damage and compensation costs are growing, putting 
further pressure on the need for Europe-wide legislative reform.
The European Commission's answer is the Single European Sky initiative - an overarching air traffic management 
project aimed at increasing capacity and decreasing disruption, which are goals supported by the airlines.
This has already turned more than 40 separate airspaces into nine "functional airspace blocks" (FABs), which exist 
regardless of state boundaries. The Blue Med block, for example, covers Italy, Malta, Greece and Cyprus.
Strikes highlight need for reform in the skies Airlines. Improvement strategy ; Summer of disruption for 
passengers focuses attention on structural problems
But some say reforms are not working as countries guard their sovereignty.
Thomas Reynaert, managing director of carrier-funded lobbying group Airlines for Europe, said governments did not 
want the "social unrest" of reducing staff. "The FABs have failed, the concept or the hope we all put in them has 
failed ... It's still officially the ambition to make them work but if you look at the France-Benelux one, that hasn't 
worked at all," he said.
Claire Davies, a director at aviation consultancy Helios, which works with the commission on the implementation of 
the Single European Sky project, agreed that its results so far had been "lacklustre".
"As an airline," said Ms Davies, "you can understand why they are dissatisfied ... Traffic levels are once again on 
the rise and actually delays are starting to creep back up." The worry for airlines is that without reforms European 
airspace will become more disrupted regardless of strikes or industrial action.
Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates national air traffic control agencies, said "core" European markets would have 
average growth in demand for flights of 40 to 55 per cent, or 900 extra flights each day, between 2017 and 2040.
"In what is already today the most complex and busy airspace in Europe, even a small percentage change is an 
operationally significant increase in traffic," Eurocontrol said.
Yet there is cause for optimism. Ms Davies points to technological advances improving air traffic management, 
supported by SESAR, a Europe-wide collaborative research programme.
So far, it has developed better "network management" (brokering decisions across borders about which aircraft 
should fly when) and free route airspace (allowing aircraft to plot their own course, rather than follow predefined 
ones). These bring environmental and economic efficiencies.
Michael Standar, head of strategy and external affairs at SESAR, said airlines' initial enthusiasm for the Single 
European Sky project had dwindled but was reviving after increasing air traffic management troubles. He cited 
SESAR's move to enable aircraft to plot routes into airports from further out as one success; another was the 
development of remote towers, so air traffic management could be done at a distance. Focus has lately been 
shifting from FABs to a continent-wide solution. The European Upper Information Region (EUIR) could unify upper 
airspace under one set of rules and allow overflights even during national strikes. But Jonathan Astill, director of 
international affairs at NATS, one of the UK's providers of air traffic management services, said: "Nobody can really 
fully describe what they mean by the EUIR."
It could mean "one big line that goes around the boundary of all the EU states and creates one single airspace", but 
he said free route airspace would achieve the same thing. He also pointed to the concentrated risk of fewer air 
traffic management centres.
Although the EUIR concept is still insufficiently defined, said Ms Davies, the European Parliament did see it "as a 
possible way of accelerating the Single European Sky" and making up what FABs did not achieve.
In a recent joint statement, Violeta Bulc, EU commissioner for transport, and Karima Delli, chair of the European 
Parliament's committee on transport and tourism, said: "The system needs an urgent upgrade. Now is the moment 
to be bold." But they conceded that progress rested with nation states. Ryanair error page 17

Last month, Europe's airline passengers experienced more than 135,000 minutes of in-flight delays on average 
each day. Put another way, that is 94 days' worth of delays every day - more than double the year before.
Strikes and a lack of capacity were the main cause of the troubles, said Eurocontrol, which compiled the data and is 
responsible for the safety of air navigation in Europe. In France, air traffic controllers took frequent industrial action, 
which meant aircraft were often unable to fly over the country.
Indeed, this summer's delays highlight structural problems afflicting the European airline sector.
Ryanair has been a notable casualty, but delays and disruption have hit all the main carriers, such as IAG, easyJet 
and Air France-KLM. For the companies, the reputational damage and compensation costs are growing, putting 
further pressure on the need for Europe-wide legislative reform.
The European Commission's answer is the Single European Sky initiative - an overarching air traffic management 
project aimed at increasing capacity and decreasing disruption, which are goals supported by the airlines.
This has already turned more than 40 separate airspaces into nine "functional airspace blocks" (FABs), which exist 
regardless of state boundaries. The Blue Med block, for example, covers Italy, Malta, Greece and Cyprus.
Strikes highlight need for reform in the skies Airlines. Improvement strategy ; Summer of disruption for 
passengers focuses attention on structural problems
But some say reforms are not working as countries guard their sovereignty.
Thomas Reynaert, managing director of carrier-funded lobbying group Airlines for Europe, said governments did not 
want the "social unrest" of reducing staff. "The FABs have failed, the concept or the hope we all put in them has 
failed ... It's still officially the ambition to make them work but if you look at the France-Benelux one, that hasn't 
worked at all," he said.
Claire Davies, a director at aviation consultancy Helios, which works with the commission on the implementation of 
the Single European Sky project, agreed that its results so far had been "lacklustre".
"As an airline," said Ms Davies, "you can understand why they are dissatisfied ... Traffic levels are once again on 
the rise and actually delays are starting to creep back up."
The worry for airlines is that without reforms European airspace will become more disrupted in the next decades, 
regardless of strikes or industrial action.
Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates national air traffic control agencies, said "core" European markets would have 
average growth in demand for flights of 40 to 55 per cent, or 900 extra flights each day, between 2017 and 2040.
"In what is already today the most complex and busy airspace in Europe, even a small percentage change is an 
operationally significant increase in traffic," Eurocontrol said.
Yet there is cause for optimism. Ms Davies points to technological advances improving air traffic management, 
supported by SESAR, a Europe-wide collaborative research programme. So far, it has developed better "network 
management" (brokering decisions across borders about which aircraft should fly when) and free route airspace 
(allowing aircraft to plot their own course, rather than follow predefined ones). These bring environmental and 
economic efficiencies.
Michael Standar, head of strategy and external affairs at SESAR, said airlines' initial enthusiasm for the Single 
European Sky project had dwindled but was reviving after increasing air traffic management troubles. He cited 
SESAR's move to enable aircraft to plot routes into airports from further out as one success; another was the 
development of remote towers, so air traffic management could be done at a distance. Focus has lately been 
shifting from FABs to a continent-wide solution. The European Upper Information Region (EUIR) could unify upper 
airspace under one set of rules and allow overflights even during national strikes. But Jonathan Astill, director of 
international affairs at NATS, one of the UK's providers of air traffic management services, said: "Nobody can really 
fully describe what they mean by the EUIR."
It could mean "one big line that goes around the boundary of all the EU states and creates one single airspace", but 
he said free route airspace would achieve the same thing. He also pointed to the concentrated risk of fewer air 
traffic management centres.
Although the EUIR concept is still insufficiently defined, said Ms Davies, the European Parliament did see it "as a 
possible way of accelerating the Single European Sky" and making up what FABs did not achieve.
In a recent joint statement, Violeta Bulc, EU commissioner for transport, and Karima Delli, chair of the European 
Parliament's committee on transport and tourism, said: "The system needs an urgent upgrade. Now is the moment 
to be bold." But they conceded that progress rested with nation states.

Low-cost airline Ryanair has reached an agreement with its Irish pilots in a labour dispute, both sides have 
announced.
"Following a 22-hour negotiating session, which began on Wednesday morning and concluded Thursday morning, 
agreement has been reached between Forsa and Ryanair in the pilots' dispute," the pilots' trade union Forsa said 
on Thursday.
Ryanair confirmed the agreement to dpa, without giving details.
The pilots now have to vote to approve the deal, with the union recommending that they accept it.
"The mediator ... has asked both sides to refrain from further comment until the ballot has concluded and we will 
respect his wishes," Ryanair said.
In the dispute over holiday time, transfers and promotions, 100 of Ryanair's 350 Irish-based pilots took part in five 
days of strike action.
The Irish airline is in dispute with trade unions in several EU countries, which came to a head in mid-August with the 
biggest pilots' strike in Ryanair's history that affected 55,000 passengers across Europe.

RYANAIR said sorry yesterday after it sent unsigned cheques to some passengers who were owed compensation 
for disrupted travel.
Thousands of Ryanair passengers have had their flights cancelled across Europe this summer due to air traffic 
control issues and pilot strikes. The airline carried 130m passengers in the 12 months ended 31 March.
Ryanair had sent out 20,000 cheques to pay compensation in July and of those less than 190 had been posted 
without being signed, meaning that they could not be cashed or banked.
"These cheques were re-issued last week and we apologise sincerely for the inconvenience," Ryanair said.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair has apologized after customers who received compensation for canceled flights 
complained that the checks bounced.
Europe's largest discount airline says "a tiny number" of checks were issued without a signature because of an 
administrative error. Ryanair says new checks have been sent to customers along with a letter of explanation.
Ryanair says the problem involved 190 compensation checks out of some 20,000 issued in July. The company says 
"we apologize sincerely for this inconvenience, which arose out of our desire to issue these compensation checks 
quickly to our customers."
Ryanair canceled hundreds of flights last year due to problems with pilot scheduling, and strikes have led to more 
cancellations this summer. European Union rules require compensation for canceled flights unless cancellations 
result from issues outside the airline's control.

Thousands of Ryanair passengers have had their flights canceled across Europe this summer due to air traffic

Ryanair said that it sent out 20,000 checks to pay compensation in July and of those less than 190 had been posted 
without being signed in an administrative error, meaning that when customers tried to cash them, they failed.
"These checks were re-issued last week and we apologize sincerely for this inconvenience," a Ryanair spokesman 
said in an emailed statement.
Ryanair endured its worst one-day strike earlier in August after a walk-out by pilots in five European countries 
disrupted the plans of an estimated 55,000 people at the height of the summer holiday season.
The budget operator plus rival European airlines have all been affected by air traffic control strikes, particularly in

Ryanair pilot unions will meet in Frankfurt today to discuss the possibility of further strikes after industrial action 
earlier this month caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
A number of national unions will review recent strikes and discuss next steps, under the umbrella of the European 
Cockpit Association. On August 10, Ryanair had to cancel 400 flights, or 15 per cent of its daily total, after pilots in 
Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands walked out. The unions have been asking for improved 
pay and conditions, as well as employment contracts under national, not Irish, law. Ryanair has said that any 
increase in salaries would harm its lowcost business model.
Joost van Doesburg of the Dutch VNV union said: "We believe that there has been no culture change yet at 
Ryanair. They are not open for good discussions regarding our demands and in that way we believe that there will 
be new strikes."
One problem for Ryanair is that its unions across Europe are synchronising their efforts. The Irish union Forsa has 
said: "Company management has previously attempted to paint its Irish pilots as outliers, saying that it was doing 
deals and conducting successful negotiations elsewhere in Europe."
Ryanair has been engaged in thirdparty mediation with Forsa after negotiations broke down; the union has staged 
five days of strikes this summer.
Ryanair on course for further strikes Airlines ; Unions consider more action, claiming carrier's culture has not 
changed
The company decided to recognise some unions for the first time in 30 years when a scheduling crisis in September 
2017 forced it to cancel 2,000 flights. It had to pay (EURO)25m in compensation to passengers for the 
cancellations. Despite recognising a handful of unions for pilots and cabin crew, Ryanair has not concluded labour 
agreements with any of them.
Ryanair's cabin crew unions have also been on strike. In July, unions in Spain, Portugal and Belgium staged two 
days of industrial action, and cabin crew in 21 countries have published a charter of demands, including a "fair living 
wage", seniority pay, predictable working hours and the application of national law.
On Friday, cabin crew unions from Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium wrote to Ryanair's shareholders urging them 
to adopt a more union-friendly business model. The unions said: "What we don't believe is that current 
management has the necessary trust from the employees or the skillset to perform these changes."
The carrier's shares have slightly recovered from their 12-month low of (EURO)12.94, which they hit on August 10, 
the day of the concerted strikes.
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.

yanair is at it again.
RTravellers have been hit by hundreds of cancelled flights this summer, ruining thousands of holidays. As if the 
disruption wasn't bad enough, passengers face a battle for compensation.
Last year, cancellations were due to an issue over pilot rostering. This year, cabin crew and pilots are striking.
By last Friday it was estimated that tens of thousands of Ryanair passengers had been caught in the chaos. While 
some people may sympathise with the strikers, most travellers won't care why their flights were cancelled: their 
priority will be to save their trip and get redress.
Ryanair, though, maintains that it will not pay the compensation due under EU rules. "As these flight cancellations 
were caused by extraordinary circumstances, no compensation is due," the airline said. It claims that under EU 
legislation, "no compensation is payable when the union is acting unreasonably and beyond the airline's control. If 
this was within our control, there would be no cancellations".
Considering the problems, customers may vow to avoid Ryanair ... but people like low fares. It's not rocket science, 
Ryanair: increase prices slightly, pay staff better and, hey presto, customers get a more reliable service.
During last year's cancellations, Ryanair also said it would not pay compensation.
Ryanair blues? This is how to complain
TheUKCivilAviationAuthority expedited enforcement action for "persistently misleading passengers with inaccurate 
information" and the airline cavedin.
I asked theCAAif it planned to do similar this time but it declined to say. It did say,however, that court rulings on 
compensation. applied even though the strike was not by Ryanair'sUKemployees.
"When a flight cancellationis caused by strike action by the airline's employees, the airline is required to pay 
compensation. to passengers," it said in a statement.
For the avoidance of doubt, here areyourrights: C Passengers can get up to (EURO)600 compensation. if a flight 
isdelayed, cancelledoryouare denied boarding. In most cases, the amount will be (EURO)250 per passenger.
C Compensation. for delays is only due on flights in theEUor whenusinganEUairline arriving three hours or more 
late. The amount depends on the length of delay, notice you were givenandflight distance. C If you accept a full 
refund and don't travel, you are not entitledtoEUcompensation. C If a flight is cancelled, the airline must offer an 
alternative flight or full refund. C If a delay lasts two hours or more, the airline must look after you by providing food 
and drinks and access to a phoneandemail. CIf you are delayed overnight, it must give you accommodation and 
travel to/from the hotel.
C If your flight is delayed by more than five hours and you no longer want to travel, the airlinemustgive a full refund.
If you are reading this thinking "Ihadnoidea Iwasentitled to that", don't despair, you have six years to bring a claim - 
there's more detail on the ComplainingCowwebsite.
Should an airline refuse a payout, passengers can go to a dispute resolution scheme. The main two are CEDR and 
Aviation ADR, but the latter has come under fire from Which? for poor performance. Withthat in mind,Ryanair 
clients may wish to go straight to seeking legal redress.
Both dispute resolution and legal action may be avoided if you complain to the airline in question. To increase your 
chances ofanaward, I suggest: 1) Write to the airline's chief executive. Findtheirdetailson www.CEOemail.com. 
Your email should reach an executive team and not elicit a foboff fromcustomerservices. 2) State that 
theCAAhasmade it clear that airline strikes are covered by EU rule 261/2004. 3) Quote Helga Krüsemann 
andOthers v TUIfly, inwhich a judge said strikes by employees are not "extraordinary". 4) If your delay affected a 
connecting flight, quote Claudia Wegener v Royal Air Maroc. The European Court of Justice ruled that airlines must 
compensate passengerswhomiss a connecting flight and arrive more thanthree hours late at a non-EUdestination. 
5) Be clear and concise. Provide your name, address, flight number, date and time, and booking reference. Send 
copiesof receipts.
6) Remember that every passengercanclaim.
For some airlines it may be better to threaten legal action. ForRyanair, use the Irish small claims court online. For 
UK airlines, use Money Claim Online.Takescreenshots from the process to show you mean business.
Remember, by using the procedure above you avoid third party complaints companies-andkeep all of 
anycompensation.

LONDON Southend Airport has said it intends to double its passenger numbers next year with the arrival of boosted 
numbers from budget carriers Easyjet and Ryanair.
Glyn Jones, chief executive of Stobart Aviation, which operates London Southend, told City A.M. that the airport is 
confident of doubling the growth rate by 2019. It has already boasted a 30 per cent increase in the number of 
passengers earlier this year, "We've also already seen a circa 30 per cent increase in passenger numbers earlier 
this year, making us London's fastest-growing airport," Jones said.
"With Easyjet expecting to fly over 1m passengers for the first time this year, and the arrival of Ryanair flights 
expected to bring over 1m passengers next year, we are confident we can double that growth rate in 2019, putting 
us firmly on track to serve 5m passengers a year by 2022."
Jones pointed to the airport's increasing popularity with passengers outside the usual hub of North Lon-don and 
Essex to other areas of London. Around 25 per cent of its passenger intake now comes from central London, 21 per 
cent from the Docklands areas and 14 per cent from the City.
"We are increasingly finding business passengers are coming from central London as they want to minimise the 
amount of time they spend waiting to fly. A number of airports need you to get to the airport hours before the 
scheduled time of departure.
"You can get here from Liverpool Street direct in 52 minutes, making it a hassle-free journey for City workers 
wanting to jet off to Geneva, Ibiza, Dublin or any of the other 30-plus routes we offer."
Southend pins growth hopes on budget airlines
London Southend has been on an expansion drive over the past year. Last October it applied to extend both ends 
of the terminal building, with construction due to begin this November.
Earlier this year it launched its private jet centre after tapping into what has become a lucrative London market. 
Jones said it recorded around 1,000 private jet movements in July alone, the same number for the whole of last 
year.

Flight rights group takes Ryanair to court over strike compensation
Flight rights group takes Ryanair to court over strike compensation

German passenger rights company Flightright is taking Ryanair to court over whether it should pay financial 
compensation to passengers affected by strikes at Europe's largest low-cost carrier.
Ryanair had to cancel around 1 in 6 flights on Friday due to a walk-out by pilots in five European countries, 
disrupting an estimated 55,000 travellers.
The worst affected country was Germany, where 250 flights were cancelled, affecting around 42,000 passengers.
EU rules state that passengers can claim monetary compensation of up to 400 euros for flights within the region for 
cancelled or delayed flights, unless the reason is extraordinary circumstances, such as bad weather.
Strikes have generally fallen under extraordinary circumstances although a ruling by the European Court of Justice 
in April said that a wildcat strike by staff at German airline TUIfly following a restructuring could not be classed as 
extraordinary circumstances. Flightright said it believes Ryanair is therefore obliged to pay monetary compensation 
to customers and so has filed a complaint with a court in Frankfurt in a bid to clarify the rules around strikes.
A spokeswoman for the court said she was aware of the Flightright statement, but that she had not yet seen the 
complaint.
Ryanair said it fully complies with the European legislation on the matter, known as EU261.
"Under EU261 legislation, no compensation is payable when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond 
the airline's control. If this was within our control, there would be no cancellations," a spokesman said.
Flight rights group takes Ryanair to court over strike compensation
Passenger rights groups such as Flightright help passengers to claim compensation from airlines under EU261 
rules but in exchange for a share of the compensation received.
Many European airlines, including Ryanair, therefore urge passengers to file claims with them directly instead.
