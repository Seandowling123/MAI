LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are set for a cautious start to the week as Wall Street slipped below the key 
12,000 level on Friday and as investors stay cautious ahead of Thursday's rate decision, dealers said.
According to IG Index, the FTSE 100 is seen opening 1 point lower at around 6,147 points, having closed on Friday 
0.3 points lower at 6,149.3.
Meanwhile, Wall Street finished the week under pressure, as a spike in the price of oil and a mixed set of job data 
added to jitters over the health of the world's largest economy.
The Labor Department revealed the unemployment rate hit a five year low, but enthusiasm was tempered as non-
farm payrolls missed market forecasts.
The DJIA ended off 32.5 points at 11,986.04, the Nasdaq Comp fell 3.23 at 2,330.79 and The S&P 500 was off 3.04 
at 1,364.30.
Meanwhile, in Asia the Nikkei 225 index closed 14.74 points firmer at 16,364.76, while the Hang Seng was up 62.68 
at 18,812.37 by midday.
Still in Asia, oil prices eased, pulling back from a sharp jump late last week sparked by threats against oil 
installations in Nigeria.
Earlier this morning, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for December delivery, was down 35 cents to 
58.79 usd a barrel from 59.14 in late US trade Friday when the contract had jumped 1.26 usd.
Back in London, Thursday's rate decision will take centre stage with investors braced for the MPC to raise 
borrowing costs to a five-year high in a bid to counter above-target inflation.
All 35 economists polled by AFX News expect the Monetary Policy Committee to raise its key repo rate by a quarter 
point to 5.00 pct, its highest level since before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US.
And data today is expected to confirm manufacturing production rose by 2.3 pct year-on-year in September, up 
from 1.5 in August -- its biggest jump in two years.
Turning to equities, a clutch of blue chip stocks including Marks & Spencer, Yell, Rentokil Initial, Standard Life, BT, 
and SABMiller are set to publish numbers later in the week.
London shares outlook - lower as Wall St slips below 12,000; rate hike eyed
But before then, this morning midcap electronics distributor Electrocomponents should report a slight improvement 
in interim adjusted pretax profits.
Seymour Pierce is looking for pretax profit before exceptionals and amortisation of 36.7 mln stg against 35.3 mln 
stg last time.
Meanwhile, Ryanair, which last month launched a 1.48 bln eur hostile offer for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, reported 
a 39 pct increase in first half profit after tax and raised its guidance for full year earnings.
For the six months to Sept 30 the Dublin-based carrier made record profit after tax of 329 mln eur, up from 237 mln 
eur last time, giving earnings per share of 42.67 cents, up 38 pct.
Other companies penciled into publish results today include Immunodiagnostic Systems, Prodesse Investment and 
Amazing Holdings.
As always on Monday, investors will look to the weekend press for inspiration, with M&A yet again hogging the 
headlines.
The troubled gaming industry will again be in focus after Ladbrokes confirmed it has held talks to buy Web betting 
firm 888 for an estimated 470 mln stg, The Times said.
The development pits the firm against PartyGaming, which has also had discussions with 888.
According to the Mail on Sunday, if the deal goes ahead, it could mean Israeli brothers Avi and Aharon Shaked, 
who together own 51.2 pct of 888, will become the largest private investors in Ladbrokes, which is valued at about 
2.5 bln stg.
And Saturday's Financial Times claimed Ladbrokes is also in talk to buy some of BWIN's operations as online 
gaming consolidation gathers pace while other reports suggest PartyGaming is also eying some of the Austrian 
internet betting company.
And Whitbread could also garner attention after the Sunday Times said US property investor Starwood Capital has 
secretly acquired a stake of almost 3 pct in the leisure conglomerate.
The stakebuilding will fuel speculation the UK company is a bid target for the investment group.
Staying in M&A, Smith & Nephew is this week set to resume takeover talks with US rival Biomet, increasing the 
possibility of a sale of its 1 bln stg wound-care business, The Times reported.
The orthopaedic group was recently forced to admit having held early stage merger negotiations and its shares 
plummeted on the news due to fears about the amount of debt necessary to fund a deal.
In retail, Signet is understood to have rebuffed an indicative approach for its UK division from a consortium 
including Gerald Ratner.
The Saturday Times claimed the jeweller rejected a 350 mln stg expression of interest from the group thought to 
also include Royal Bank Of Scotland and a private equity firm.
Meanwhile, the Sunday Express reported that Ratner has teamed up with acquisitive Icelandic investor Baugur to 
push forward his 350 mln stg bid for Signet's UK outlets.
And The London Stock Exchange could be active after The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported the bourse operator is 
proposing an operational tie-up with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, including the cross-listing of exchange-traded 
funds.
According to the paper, a senior LSE official presented the plan during a visit to the TSE last month.

NEW YORK (AFX) - U.S. stocks on Monday headed higher after losses last week, with a cooling off of oil prices 
helping to bring bulls back into the market. Traders also may be taking last-minute positions ahead of Tuesday's 
mid-term elections.
In the opening minutes, the Dow Jones industrials gained .08 of a point to 11,986.12, the S&P 500 rose .06 of a 
point to 1,364.36, and the Nasdaq advanced 10.87 points to 2,341.66.
On Friday, the Dow industrials dropped for the sixth session in a row, as a surge in long-term interest rates and a 
spike in oil prices overshadowed a largely positive October jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 
32.5 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.2 points and the S&P 500 lost 3 points.
But crude oil futures dropped back below $59 a barrel in electronic trading on Monday. December crude declined 
45 cents to $58.69 a barrel.
A number of Federal Reserve members are due to speak Monday, including Chicago Fed President Michael 
Moskow, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pinalto and San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen.
The dollar rose on the Japanese yen and was about level against the euro.
Gold futures slipped $1.50 to $627.70 an ounce.
Earnings releases are due from El Paso, Anadarko Petroleum, XM Satellite and RealNetworks Inc.
Anadarko separately said it's selling Gulf of Mexico assets to Statoil for $901 million.
Also on the deal front, Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts and the private-equity arm of Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $4.6 
billion for the forklift unit of Germany's Linde.
KKR also was in the news after France's Vivendi confirmed it received, and rejected, a takeover approach from the 
private-equity group said to be worth around $50 billion. Vivendi shares declined in Paris on concerns that tax 
issues may make it difficult for the entertainment and telecommunications conglomerate to be bought.
Also on the private-equity front, The Wall Street Journal reported that Merrill Lynch's arm received an informal 
inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies being probed suggest that the Justice Department may 
be examining Ford Motor Co.'s sale of its Hertz rental unit to private-equity buyers.
Stocks up slightly in opening minutes
Elsewhere, ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers Squibb reported mixed Phase III trials of Erbitux to treat colorectal 
cancer. The companies said they will talk to the Food and Drug Administration after the studies.
Irish airline Ryanair Holdings led an advance in European stock markets after the low-cost carrier improved its 
earnings outlook for the year.
The Nikkei 225 finished with a modest 0.1 percent rise in Tokyo.

SATURDAY PRESS COMMENT
FT
THE LEX COLUMN comments on RYANAIR's bid for AER LINGUS (the 47 pct stake pro-management investors 
hold is not enough to block Ryanair's ambitions; but it is certainly enough to make price only one of the factors that 
will determine the bid's success), US economy (a smooth landing looks more remote than ever), Risk appetite (fed 
up with watching private equity have all the fun, the risk is that some CFOs adopt a much more aggressive stance 
at precisely the wrong moment), PROSIEBEN (selling to private equity investors could prove quicker for the 
vendors and (marginally) more palatable for a German audience) - Weekend share watch: GEORGE WIMPEY 
(long-term investors should hold on to a cheap stock, but with its exposure to the US, it may be vulnerable to 
disappointment), RENTOKIL INITIAL (Rentokil expects only 'modest profit growth in 2007', making the prospects for 
a share price rally unlikely), REXAM (Seymour Pierce raised its rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'outperform', 
saying that aside from make-up, the rest of the plastics division was performing better than expected; investors in 
Rexam, whose shares are up 9.3 pct on beginning of the year, may wish to extend their sell-by dates) - 
MILLENNIUM & COPTHORNE (rating not particularly appealing compared with rest of the sector - Cazenove) - 
LONDON MARKET: ICI (suggestions it may sell its Quest flavours and fragrances business), DSG 
INTERNATIONAL (talk that a US value investor has been selling stock), BEMA GOLD (rumours of a bid approach 
from Canada) - MY PORTFOLIO: John Lee buys more shares in GIBBS & DANDY, QUARTO and WENSUM; he 
has been building up a holding in DAWSON HOLDINGS and made small purchases of MKM GROUP and carpet 
producer VICTORIA; he takes profits in EGDON RESOURCES
    Independent
AFX UK at a glance share guide - weekend
  NO PAIN, NO GAIN: Derek Pain comments on GATEKEEPER SYSTEMS (look undervalued) - MARKET REPORT: 
COMMODITRADE (speculation that a bidder is doing due diligence on the company but that management do not 
want to sell out for under 60 pence per share)
Mail
INVESTMENT EXTRA: SR PHARMA (looks worth a punt); GEIGER COUNTER (a handy way to play the (uranium) 
market)
    Times
 Directors' dealing: AMLIN (senior executive buys 108,832 shares at 303-1/2 pence) - STOCK MARKETS - LARGE 
CAPS: SMITHS GROUP (HONEYWELL said to be taking a look), BP (suggestions that India's RELIANCE INDUSTRIES 
is set to buy the British oil company's Belgian operations for 2 bln usd); SMALL CAPS: VENTURE PRODUCTION 
(touted as a target in the latest round of sector consolidation) - TEMPUS: WOLFSON MICROELECTRONICS (the 
shares, while volatile, are worth buying ahead of expected releases from APPLE and SONY, which should both 
benefit Wolfson), ARM HOLDINGS (on a rating of 20 times future earnings, investors should hold), CSR (has 
a strong market position but remains vulnerable to new technologies; hold)
Telegraph
QUESTOR COLUMN: Six income stocks: CARPETRIGHT, LLOYDS TSB, RHM, BT, CATTLES TOMKINS - THE 
MARKET: GO-AHEAD (STAGECOACH bid speculation), PREMIER OIL (speculation in India that RELIANCE 
INDUSTRIES is looking to pounce)
    Express
 Market expert Trevor Webster adds SMITHS NEWS to his 2005-6 Portfolio; he sells NATIONAL EXPRESS to 
realise a good profit of 20 pct; he also sells CHRISTIAN SALVESEN after its disappointing report a few 
weeks back
Guardian
Market forces: JJB SPORTS (talk that Permira is casting an eye over the company), MILLWALL (one Graham 
Lacey takes a 3.17 pct stake), IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS HOLDINGS (Monday's half-year results expected 
to make happy reading), WHITBREAD (break-up speculation)
SUNDAY PRESS COMMENT
Sunday Telegraph
The Footsie's biggest polluters: INTERNATIONAL POWER (cost of carbon emissions as % of market capitalisation 
17.5), CORUS GROUP (10.7), DRAX GROUP (8.7), BRITISH ENERGY (6.7), BRITISH AIRWAYS (4.2), ROYAL 
DUTCH SHELL (3.6), SCOTTISH & SOUTHERN ENERGY (3.3), BP (2.9), HANSON (2.4), SCOTTISH POWER 
(2.3), CENTRICA (2.3), CARNIVAL (1.8), TATE & LYLE (1.3, ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS (1.2), JOHNSON 
MATTHEY (1.2), ANGLO AMERICAN (1.1), ICI (0.9), BHP BILLITON (0.9), COMPASS GROUP (0.8), SEVERN 
TRENT (0.8) - breaking views: SMITH & NEPHEW (private equity firms have been sniffing round it for ages; and if 
there is a premium to be had, S&N's shareholders may prefer to receive it rather than pay it away to BIOMET) - 
Equity View: ICI (keep buying), TOLUNA (speculative buy), FINDEL (leave your original investment in the business; 
bank the rest as profits), AMIAD FILTRATION SYSTEMS (buy)
    Sunday Times
 Investors are filling up with biofuels; several young firms have plans for growth, but food companies and 
oil giants will dominate (BUSINESS p.11) - CADBURY makes future sweeter; the confectioner is trying to put 
disappointing profits behind it by revealing plans for expansion (BUSINESS p.17) - INSIDE THE CITY: Grant 
Ringshaw comments on Lloyd's of London insurers (with private-equity firms flush with cash, the Cathedral 
Capital deal is unlikely to be the last), F&C ASSET MANAGEMENT (only investors prepared for a long haul 
should buy) - Directors' Deals: ACCUMA chief exec and finance director both fork out just over 48,000 stg 
for 19,000 shares at a cost of 253 pence each), TRISTEL (director disposes of 160,000 shares at 45 pence 
each to raise 72,000 stg)
Sunday Express
AFX UK at a glance share guide - weekend
Between a rock and a hard place; online betting went to Gibralter to escape tax in 1999. Can it now return? 
(Financial Sunday Express p.4)
    Mail on Sunday
 WOOLIES goes to war with toys; prices are cut in 7 mln stg promotion as boss looks for the right formula 
to halt sales slide (Financial Mail p.6) - MIDAS: FINDEL (undervalued; the shares should prove rewarding 
over time, whether or not Findel does the splits (demerges); DAVENHAM (the shares have done well, but if 
the company keeps its promises, the price has further to go)

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline which last month launched a 1.48 bln eur 
hostile offer for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC, has reported a 39 pct increase in first half profit after tax 
and raised its guidance for full year earnings.
For the six months to Sept 30 the Dublin-based carrier made record profit after tax of 329 mln eur, up from 237 mln 
eur last time, giving earnings per share of 42.67 cents, up 38 pct.
Ryanair said it remains cautious about its second half due to substantial capacity expansion and higher oil prices.
However, it still raised its guidance for year to end-March 2007 net profit after tax.
It now expects net profit after tax to rise 16 pct to 350 mln eur, up from previous guidance of 335 mln eur.

THE LEX COLUMN comments on RYANAIR's bid for AER LINGUS (the 47 pct stake pro-management investors 
hold is not enough to block Ryanair's ambitions; but it is certainly enough to make price only one of the factors that 
will determine the bid's success), US economy (a smooth landing looks more remote than ever), Risk appetite (fed 
up with watching private equity have all the fun, the risk is that some CFOs adopt a much more aggressive stance 
at precisely the wrong moment), PROSIEBEN (selling to private equity investors could prove quicker for the 
vendors and (marginally) more palatable for a German audience) - Weekend share watch: GEORGE WIMPEY 
(long-term investors should hold on to a cheap stock, but with its exposure to the US, it may be vulnerable to 
disappointment), RENTOKIL INITIAL (Rentokil expects only 'modest profit growth in 2007', making the prospects for 
a share price rally unlikely), REXAM (Seymour Pierce raised its rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'outperform', 
saying that aside from make-up, the rest of the plastics division was performing better than expected; investors in 
Rexam, whose shares are up 9.3 pct on beginning of the year, may wish to extend their sell-by dates) - 
MILLENNIUM & COPTHORNE (rating not particularly appealing compared with rest of the sector - Cazenove) -

shares, while volatile, are worth buying ahead of expected releases from APPLE and SONY, which should both 
benefit Wolfson), ARM HOLDINGS (on a rating of 20 times future earnings, investors should hold), CSR (has 
a strong market position but remains vulnerable to new technologies; hold)

LONDON (AFX) - Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus Group PLC, the Irish flag carrier, reckons it is 
impossible for Ryanair Holdings PLC's 1.48 bln eur hostile bid to succeed.
'I cannot conceive of circumstances in which the Ryanair bid will be successful,' he told AFX News in an interview 
shortly after Aer Lingus published its defence document.
Ryanair launched the surprise 2.80 eur a share offer on Oct 5, just eight days after Aer Lingus' initial public offering 
valued the airline at 1.16 bln eur. The bid was immediately rejected by Aer Lingus' board as 'unsolicited and wholly 
opportunistic'.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Irish government with 25.4 pct, the Aer Lingus 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
extremely difficult for Ryanair.
Ryanair needs the ESOT to change its mind to have any chance of success. Mannion reckons this will not happen.
'ESOT is already preparing for a ballot, which will be concluded by Nov 30, and that ballot will overwhelmingly reject 
the Ryanair bid,' he claimed.
The chief executive said Aer Lingus is not allowing the Ryanair business to distract it.
'It's very much business as usual for Aer Lingus although we are nonetheless determined to see off this bid at the 
earliest possible date,' he said.
'We have an independent profitable growth strategy for long haul and short haul and we're continuing to get a lot of 
support for that strategy from our shareholder base.'
Mannion reckons there is support for 'the sort of price levels that the shares are currently at in the market whether 
Ryanair stays as a continuing shareholder or not.'
At 11.35 am shares in Aer Lingus were unchanged at 2.88 eur. Shares in Ryanair were up 0.02 eur at 8.95 eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC has reiterated its rejection of arch-rival Ryanair Holdings 
PLC's hostile bid for the company, describing the 1.48 bln eur offer as 'derisory'.
'Faced with a strong, well-capitalised and independent Aer Lingus, Ryanair, our principal short-haul competitor, has 
reacted in a hostile, anti-competitive manner designed to eliminate a rival at a derisory price,' Aer Lingus chairman 
John Sharman said in the airline's defence document posted to shareholders today.
In the document, Aer Lingus said Ryanair's 2.80 eur per share bid overlooks its prospects as an independent 
company, and prices the airline at a discount to other European carriers of a similar size.
The Irish flag-carrier revealed it has set itself a target return of 15 pct a year on its investment in new aircraft.
The group also highlighted the 'significant growth prospects' of its long-haul service to the US, a route not served by 
Ryanair, which currently only operates short-haul services.
'We have excellent growth opportunities and we have the fleet, staff, capital resources and management to deliver 
for shareholders,' Sharman said.
Ryanair, led by colourful chief executive Michael O'Leary, launched the surprise offer on Oct 5, just eight days after 
Aer Lingus' initial public offering valued the airline at 1.16 bln eur.
The bid was immediately rejected by Aer Lingus' board as 'unsolicited and wholly opportunistic'.

Ryanair reports second-quarter results on Monday.

Aer Lingus to increase long haul capacity
Aer Lingus to increase long haul capacity

LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC, the Irish flag carrier currently fighting a 1.48 bln stg hostile bid by Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, has announced plans to increase its long haul service.
The increased flight programme for 2007 will result from the delivery in May and June next year of two new long 
haul A330 aircraft, increasing the long haul fleet to nine aircraft.
They will add 26 flights each week providing a 28 pct boost to Aer Lingus' long haul capacity and bringing to 120 
the total number of long haul flights which will be operated weekly by the airline to and from the US and Middle 
East.
'The arrival of two new long haul aircraft next year marks the first phase of the long haul expansion plan and gives 
Aer Lingus the opportunity to develop its presence in the US market,' said chief executive Dermot Mannion.
'We look forward to a timely decision on the bilateral agreement which will allow Aer Lingus to take full advantage of 
open skies.'
Ryanair launched its surprise 2.80 eur a share offer on Oct 5, just eight days after Aer Lingus' initial public offering 
valued the airline at 1.16 bln eur. The bid was immediately rejected by Aer Lingus' board as 'unsolicited and wholly 
opportunistic'.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid hold already some 46.6 pct -- the Irish government with 25.4 pct, the Aer Lingus 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
difficult for Ryanair.
Aer Lingus must publish its defence document by Monday Nov 6 -- the same day Ryanair is scheduled to publish 
first quarter results.
At 9.15 am shares in Aer Lingus were up 0.1 eur at 2.86 eur. Ryanair was flat at 8.78 eur.

Ryanair hits back at calls for green taxes on aviation
Ryanair hits back at calls for green taxes on aviation

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has dismissed calls for green taxes on aviation, saying 
aircraft emissions are insignificant compared to the pollution caused by emerging economies and cars.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary described recent demands by UK lawmakers and environment campaigners for 
the airline industry to face new taxes to help fight climate change as 'the usual horseshit'.
A report commissioned by the UK Treasury and released earlier this week called for tougher measures to combat 
the effects of global warming.
The report's author, former World Bank economist Sir Nicholas Stern, said international flights create twice as many 
emissions as domestic journeys and the impact on climate changes goes beyond greenhouse gases.
Speaking at a news conference to launch a new Ryanair gaming service, O'Leary claimed aviation accounts for 
only 3 pct of global greenhouse gas emissions.
He said campaigners should instead be focusing on more significant sources of pollution, such as tiger economies 
like China and road transport.
'If people are really serious about tackling the miniscule emissions from the aircraft industry, they should be looking 
at airlines still using old gas-guzzling aircraft,' he added.
O'Leary claimed green taxes on flights would not affect the growth of Ryanair or other no-frills airlines because of 
the price differential between the cost of their flights and those of traditional flag carriers.
He said Ryanair had no plans to join the European Union's carbon emission trading scheme, which he said he had 
not even heard of.
International air travel is not included in the scheme, but the British government is keen to see it included, 
particularly with the rise in low cost carriers.
Meanwhile, O'Leary said security at most British airports had returned to normal following the disruption caused by 
the discovery in August of an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic flights.
However, he said security at Stansted airport near London was still 'a shambles' and accused airport operator BAA 
of not recruiting enough security staff.
Ryanair hits back at calls for green taxes on aviation
BAA claimed Ryanair had failed to agree to its request to open airline check-in desks earlier to cope with the extra 
demand, but O'Leary said that would still leave passengers waiting.

LONDON (AFX) - Second quarter results on Monday from Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, 
look set to be overshadowed by its 1.48 bln stg hostile bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
Ryanair launched the surprise 2.80 eur a share offer on Oct 5, just eight days after Aer Lingus' initial public offering 
valued the airline at 1.16 bln eur. The bid was immediately rejected by Aer Lingus' board as 'unsolicited and wholly 
opportunistic'.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid hold already some 46.6 pct -- the Irish government with 25.4 pct, the Aer Lingus 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
difficult for Ryanair.
The two airlines have engaged in a war of words since the bid was launched.
Aer Lingus has written to the Irish takeover panel accusing Ryanair of 'serious misrepresentations' in its offer 
document.
Ryanair has claimed Aer Lingus ESOT members will receive 60,000 eur each if they accept the offer. Aer Lingus 
reckons the offer is worth just 32,500 eur.
As for the second quarter to end-September figures, Goodbody Stockbrokers is forecasting a profit before tax of 
207.2 mln eur, up from 172.0 mln eur last time, and a 21 pct rise in earnings per share to 26.8 cents, driven by a 21 
pct rise in passenger volumes, a 2.5 pct lift in average fares per passenger, an 8 pct increase in ancillary revenues 
per passenger and ongoing control of costs, excluding fuel.
Oddo Securities is forecasting a 24.2 pct rise in net profit to 214 mln eur and in EPS to 28 cents, despite a 32 pct 
rise in the fuel bill. It reckons Ryanair may again raise its earnings guidance.
On Sept 29 Ryanair raised its year to end-March 2007 net profit guidance to approximately 335 mln eur, a rise of 11 
pct on last year's 302 mln eur.
OUTLOOK Ryanair 's bid for Aer Lingus to overshadow Q2 results
But the airline said it remained cautious on the outlook for the winter. It forecast full year passenger growth of 22 pct 
to 42.5 mln passengers, second half load factors -- a measure of how full planes are -- down 2 pct on last year, and 
a 5 pct decline in yields (average fares).
Ryanair will benefit only to a limited extent from the recent sharp fall in oil prices as the group had already hedged 
90 pct of its needs at 73-74 usd a barrel.
The airline is aiming to double in size by 2012, when it is targeting annual passengers of 84 mln.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair has asked European competition watchdogs to rule on its bid for Irish flag carrier Aer 
Lingus, but concerns are growing that the size of deal may not be big enough for Brussels to get involved, the 
Financial Times reported.
If the no-frills airline fails to have Europe scrutinise the deal, it will instead face an examination by the Irish 
Competition Commission, which the paper claimed would be a significant set back for Ryanair.
The Irish government, which owns a stake of 25.35 pct in Aer Lingus, has expressed fierce opposition to the 1.5 bln 
eur bid for the former state-owned airline.
To come under the jurisdiction of Brussels the merger must lead to combined worldwide turnover greater than 2.5 
bln eur and combined turnover of more than 100 mln eur in at least three European Union member states, while 
each company must have a turnover of more than 25 mln eur in those three member states.
The proposed deal may narrowly fail on the latter condition, the FT said.

MADRID (AFX) - Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA sees little change to its operating environment from low cost 
carriers setting up bases in Madrid, the carrier's commercial manager Manuel Lopez Colmenarejo said.
Speaking to analysts on Iberia's Investor Day, Lopez Colmenarejo said:
'Of course we will lose passenger growth with Ryanair, but on the earnings side we will continue to grow, 
maintaining our strong position.'
The executive said Iberia's 'Spanish flagship' will maintain its leading position due to the company's long-haul 
operations, its key hub in Madrid, and increasing its flight capacity in frequency in 2007.
'Our position in Madrid as a key hub is much stronger than Ryanair...we have been here for many years and 
Ryanair is just starting,' he said.
'We are going to increase our capacity in frequency in 2007, far beyond where we are now,' Colmenarejo added.
Recently, both Ryanair and Easyjet announced plans to operate Spanish domestic routes from bases in Madrid.

MADRID (AFX) - Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA's investor day today comes at an intense moment of 
competition for the carrier after recent announcements of new Ryanair Holdings PLC and Easyjet PLC bases in 
Madrid, the flag carrier's home ground, analysts said.
Iberia will be providing some details on its nine-months to September results, but it is not known whether the 
company will give all the main P&L lines as it did last year, or whether it will provide any full-year forecasts.
Last year, Iberia provided full-year operating profit guidance at its Investor Day.
Traffic figures for October are expected with Monday's presentation, however, which will give a further clue as to 
exactly how much market share low cost companies are eroding from Iberia's domestic and European segments, 
as well as how far the flag carrier has managed to offset this with its solid long-haul operations.
ABN Amro said it expects traffic figures to continue to improve, in line with the trend seen in August.
'August traffic data showed that the strategy of increasing the share of traffic on long-haul routes and growing 
premium, in the face of increased competition from LCCs on the short haul, is starting to pay off...we believe 
Monday's figures should demonstrate more of the same,' ABN Amro said.
'We believe Iberia may well accelerate some parts of its plan to drive 600 mln eur of improvements to margins 
through driving revenue and cutting costs,' he added.
Ahorro Corporacion Financiera analysts said they are expecting details on the company's fuel hedging policy for 
2007, amid the recent easing of oil prices worldwide.
Fuel costs are crucial to Iberia's 2006-2008 strategic plan, which forecasts EBITDAR margin reaching at least 16 
pct and a return on equity of at least 10 pct in 2008, if oil prices stay at over 50 usd per barrel.
A key question for analysts is whether the targets set out by the company to 2008 are still feasible given the 
increase in competition on its home turf.
We'll be looking for an update on their three-year business plan...a lot of things have changed, BNP Paribas 
analysts said.
OUTLOOK Iberia investor day to update co's performance amid stiff competition
Earlier this month, Ryanair announced plans to open a base in Madrid by November, following hot on the heels of 
EasyJet's announcement of six new routes out of its new Madrid hub.
One of the keys to facing this challenge is how Iberia can increase its exposure to the low cost segment through its 
20-pct owned Clickair affiliate without upsetting the powerful pilots union or other employees and creating further 
labour disputes after a very unsettled year at its HR department.
'We can also expect them to put the competition into context with their growth objectives, offsetting it with their 
position as a key hub between Europe and Latin America through its Terminal 4 in Madrid,' Ahorro analysts said.
Ahorro Corporacion sees net profit coming in at 65.9 mln eur while Citigroup expects it to reach 77.2 mln eur, down 
from 395.8 mln a year earlier.
Iberia's third quarter net profit in 2005 was distorted by some of the capital gains from the sale of part of its stake in 
Amadeus Global Travel Distribution SA.
Ahorro Corporacion sees Iberia's third quarter EBITDAR increasing 8.7 pct to 260.7 mln eur from 239.7 mln, while 
estimates for EBIT reach 89-98 mln, up from 80.8 mln a year earlier.
Both Ahorro Corporacion and Citigroup analysts expect Iberia to post third quarter operating revenue of 1.423 bln 
eur, down from 1.978 bln a year earlier.

LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC today said Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus is worth considerably less than 
the 60,000 eur per ESOT member Ryanair claimed in its statement yesterday.
Aer Lingus said the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) has approximately 4,665 members and, after 
allowing for the trust's borrowings, the offer is worth an average of approximately 32,500 eur per ESOT member, an 
inaccuracy which has been drawn to Ryanair's attention.
Yesterday, Ryanair urged Aer Lingus employees to accept its offer of 2.80 eur per share which it said, 'will result in 
Aer Lingus employees realising over 220 mln eur for their shares in the airline... an average of over 60,000 eur per 
employee, with a tax free option for ESOT members'.
Today's response from Aer Lingus said: 'This purported tax-free status is highly conditional, dependent on Revenue 
approval and, extraordinarily, dependent on Aer Lingus employees and former employees going into the public 
markets and buying shares in Ryanair, a company whose stock has under-performed other European airlines 
during 2006.'
'The numerous misrepresentations by Ryanair will be dealt with in full when Aer Lingus issues its response to 
Ryanair's conditional offer.'

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC today accused airport operator BAA of causing delays at 
London's Stansted airport by failing to provide enough security staff.
Ryanair said BAA's failure to fully staff security points through peak periods at Stansted was responsible for 
increased disruption at the Essex airport in the last fortnight.
The Irish carrier, which is claiming 3 mln stg from the UK government for disruption caused by the UK terror alert in 
August, said the situation had deteriorated during that time and had caused chaos for passengers almost every 
day.
In a statement, it provided passengers with BAA's address and urged them to write to the company, which is owned 
by Spanish construction group Grupo Ferrovial SA.
'Ryanair will do everything it can to ensure BAA eliminates the intolerable failures in providing fully staffed security 
points, as almost every other UK airport manages to do every day,' it said in a statement.
A BAA spokesman said the company was in the process of recruiting 160 extra staff to cope with higher demand 
during periods such as school holidays.
However, he said this would take time and Ryanair had refused to agree to a request to airlines to introduce interim 
measures such as opening check-in desks earlier.
'They (Ryanair) have said this would cost them more money, so they don't want to do it,' he said.
In a separate announcement today, Ryanair said it was buying 10 flight simulators from flight simulator supplier 
CAE for more than 80 mln usd.

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC today accused airport operator BAA of causing delays at 
London's Stansted airport by failing to provide enough security staff.
Ryanair said BAA's failure to fully staff security points through peak periods at Stansted was responsible for 
increased disruption at the Essex airport in the last fortnight.
The Irish carrier, which is claiming 3 mln stg from the UK government for disruption caused by the UK terror alert in 
August, said the situation had deteriorated during that time and had caused chaos for passengers almost every 
day.
In a statement, it provided passengers with BAA's address and urged them to write to the company, which is owned 
by Spanish construction group Grupo Ferrovial SA.
'Ryanair will do everything it can to ensure BAA eliminates the intolerable failures in providing fully staffed security 
points, as almost every other UK airport manages to do every day,' it said in a statement.
A BAA spokesman said the company was in the process of recruiting 160 extra staff to cope with higher demand 
during periods such as school holidays.
However, he said this would take time and Ryanair had refused to agree to a request to airlines to introduce interim 
measures such as opening check-in desks earlier.
'They (Ryanair) have said this would cost them more money, so they don't want to do it,' he said.
In a separate announcement today, Ryanair said it was buying 10 flight simulators from flight simulator supplier 
CAE for more than 80 mln usd.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair says it has bought 10 flight simulators from CAE Inc for over 80 mln usd.
The simulators, which replicate the cockpit of the low-cost airline's Boeing 737-800 fleet, will be delivered from 
2008.
Ryanair CFO and deputy chief executive Howard Miller said the simulators would enable the company to provide 
'world class pilot training' for its flight crews as it seeks to double passenger numbers to more than 80 mln in 2012.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC called on the balance of the Aer Lingus Group PLC board to 'recuse' 
themselves from considering Ryanair's offer on the grounds that they were all appointed by the Minister for 
Transport.
In a Stock Exchange statement issued by Aer Lingus this afternoon, two directors, Francis Hackett and Michael 
Johns, confirmed that they are not participating in the board's consideration of the offer from Ryanair and related 
matters because it would not be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders as a whole as they were 
appointed by the Minister for Transport.
Ryanair said that as this is the case for the whole Aer Lingus board, the balance should follow suit.
The Minister for Transport has publicly stated his and the Government's opposition to the Ryanair bid. 'It is therefore 
not appropriate for his appointees to decide what is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders, as 
they are also conflicted and therefore should recuse themselves.'
Aer Lingus earlier reiterated its rejection of Ryanair's 1.48 bln eur takeover bid after Ryanair said it was 
approaching the Irish flag carrier's shareholders with the formal terms of its offer.

LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC reiterated its rejection of Ryanair Hldgs' 1.48 bln eur takeover bid after 
Ryanair said it was approaching the Irish flag carrier's shareholders with the formal terms of its offer.
Aer Lingus, which has already made clear its opposition to the no-frills carrier's hostile cash offer, confirmed its 
position in a statement this afternoon after Ryanair said this morning it was posting the document to Aer Lingus 
shareholders.
Aer Lingus' chairman John Sharman described the bid as 'without merit', saying it failed to recognise the unique 
position of the flag carrier's 'businesses, its outstanding track record and its excellent growth prospects.'
'The offer also ignores the significant regulatory issues that a combination would face,' Sharman said.
'A takeover by Ryanair, no matter how it is dressed up, would be bad for Aer Lingus, for its shareholders, for its 
employees and for consumers.'
He added: 'The board of Aer Lingus, which has already rejected the offer, will formally respond in detail when it 
issues its response setting out the views of the participating directors on the offer within the next fourteen days.
'In the meantime, Aer Lingus shareholders are strongly urged to take no action.'

LONDON (AFX) - Citigroup has raised its earnings forecasts and target prices across the European airline sector to 
reflect lower fuel prices, following the drop in the cost of oil since September, dealers said.
In a review of the sector landing on fund managers desks today, the US broker said it is now using a figure of 60 
usd a barrel for Brent Crude, down on its previous level of mostly 70 usd a barrel.
Citigroup said this change raises its average 2007 EBIT forecast for European airlines by over 9 pct and for net 
income by over 10 pct.
The broker added that the unhedged airlines that are, obviously, most geared to oil prices fluctuations are Austrian 
Airlines, Iberia SA, Ryanair PLC, and SAS AB.
Citigroup said it expects strong Q3 earnings from the European airlines, with on average 20 pct-plus EBIT and 40 
pct-plus net income growth expected, driven by 5 pct-plus unit revenue and ongoing cost cutting.
The broker added that the biggest earnings uplift is expected from Deustche Lufthansa AG, due to a recovery in its 
core airline and catering divisions.
Citigroup added that the worst performance is expected from Alitalia SpA, while British Airways PLC could see a fall 
in its Q3 EBIT due to draconian hand baggage regulations at Heathrow deterring premium connecting traffic.
The broker said it is raising target prices by an average of over 7 pct, although it has made no change to ratings 
with valuations at around average historical levels.
Citigroup said its top sector picks are Air France-KLM SA, easyJet PLC, and Lufthansa, all of which it has 'buy' 
ratings on.
The broker added that its top sell idea is Alitalia, as it doubts the firm will survive long-term due to its commercial, 
labour and financial problems.

MARSEILLE (AFX) - Budget airline Ryanair said it has postponed the opening of new routes between Morocco and 
France and Germany after an agreement to create a common airspace between the European Union and Morocco 
was delayed.
The airline said that in order for it to open the new routes, all member states of the EU must sign a preliminary 
agreement aimed at creating a common European airspace which includes Morocco.
However, the signing of the agreement, originally slated for the beginning of October, has now been pushed back to 
November 17, it said.
New routes between Morocco and Frankfurt and Marseille will now open on December 1, rather than the end of 
October for Frankfurt flights, and November 8 for Marseille flights, as was originally planned.
Clients who have already booked onto the routes will be reimbursed or will receive alternative tickets, the airline 
said.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has agreed to give passengers fairer contract terms following action by the 
Office of Fair Trading in the UK.
The OFT had a number of concerns regarding Ryanair's liability for damage to or loss of luggage and delay or 
cancellation of flights and the company said it has now changed its contract with passengers to give them a fairer 
deal.
Specifically, Ryanair has removed the exclusion of liability for damage or delay to sporting equipment, infant 
equipment, medical/mobility equipment and musical instruments from its terms and conditions.
For baggage claims Ryanair has removed the requirement for passengers to reclaim after 21 days if baggage is still 
reported as lost and not found.
Ryanair's liability in the event that flights are delayed or cancelled, or passengers are denied boarding on a flight 
have also been amended.
Ray Hall, OFT Director of Services said: 'The OFT's action has secured improvements to Ryanair's terms that will 
benefit passengers. We expect other airlines using similar terms to stop doing so immediately. Continued use of 
such terms will be considered a breach of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.'

DUBLIN, Ireland (AFX) - Irish tycoon Denis O'Brien said Tuesday he has bought a 2.1 pct stake in the recently 
privatised airline Aer Lingus Group PLC and wants to help block a hostile takeover bid by rival carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC.
The intervention by O'Brien, who has made billions developing mobile-phone companies from Ireland to the 
Caribbean, represented the first confirmed effort by a third party to oppose the takeover bid launched Oct 5 by 
Ryanair.
The surprise attack by Ryanair, Europe's fastest-growing airline, came just a week after the government sold its 
majority stake in Aer Lingus, one of the world's few profitable state-owned airlines.
The Irish government, Aer Lingus management and unions all oppose the Ryanair offer of 2.80 eur a share, which 
is a 27 pct premium over Aer Lingus' Sept 27 IPO price of 2.20 euros.
O'Brien said in a statement he had purchased more than 32 million eur of Aer Lingus shares because he didn't want 
Ryanair to strangle airline competition in Ireland. He said his move was designed to bolster existing efforts by 
investment trusts representing Aer Lingus employees to build up a blocking share.
Ryanair holds more than 19 pct of the shares but requires more than 50 pct to mount a successful takeover. It is 
legally barred from increasing its holding while the share price remains above its euros 2.80 offer.
The government still holds more than 28 pct of the shares and has ruled out the prospect of selling to Ryanair. A 
long-established share ownership trust for the entire Aer Lingus work force, representing more than 3,300 people, 
owns more than 11 pct of shares. A new trust representing Aer Lingus pilots had built up a 2.24 pct stake as of 
Tuesday.
Analysts say this means a combination of anti-Ryanair investors -- the government, Aer Lingus employees and 
O'Brien -- could block a Ryanair takeover if they can acquire about 6 pct more of Aer Lingus shares.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said it has not considered any increase in 
its hostile offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC, the Irish flag carrier.
'Ryanair's (2.80 eur a share, 1.48 bln eur) offer is an excellent offer and the board has not considered any increase 
in the offer for Aer Lingus and therefore any increase cannot be ruled in or ruled out,' it said in a statement.
The statement was issued to clarify comments 'taken out of context by some media reports following a new route 
press conference this morning in Dublin.'
Earlier, Ryanair announced new routes from Dublin to Warsaw and Stockholm, starting next year.

Ryanair facing industrial action in Italy, Spain

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, is facing industrial action in both Italy and 
Spain, according to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF).
In a statement, the ITF said that in Italy, the Irish carrier's employees are refusing to sell non-essential 'extras', such 
as hot drinks, food and alcohol.
It said the workers are protesting because after they joined the Fit Cisl Comparto Volo union to represent them, 
Ryanair refused to engage in talks and tried to transfer the staff who had been nominated as union representatives.
In Spain, the ITF said ground handling staff will take strike action from today, culminating in a 24 hour strike on Oct 
23.
This follows what their union, the Comisiones Obreras, describes as Ryanair persistently ignoring negotiated 
agreements, the right to join a union and statutory requirements.
'Discontent is never far from the surface at Ryanair, where workers feel mistrusted, marginalised and mistreated,' 
said Ingo Marowsky, secretary of the ITF's civil aviation section.
'With this kind of reaction to his (Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's) tactics it is no surprise that O'Leary's attempted 
takeover of Aer Lingus Group PLC has been greeted with such opposition,' he added.
Earlier this month Aer Lingus rejected a 1.48 bln eur offer from Ryanair.

MONTREAL (AFX) - CAE Inc. has won 65 million Canadian dollars ($57.1 million) worth of orders for six full-flight 
simulators, training devices and simulator upgrades, with most of them being purchased by European discount 
airline Ryanair, the company announced Monday.
Ryanair is buying five Boeing 737NG Level B full-flight simulators, taking delivery of one each year from 2008 to 
2012, while Prescient Systems & Technologies is purchasing a full-flight simulator for the Airbus A-320.
Prescient will use its simulator at the new aviation training center in the Philippines.
The orders bring CAE's total number of full-flight simulator sales to 19 for the 2007 financial year, which ends in 
March.
'This contract with Prescient once again demonstrates CAE's continued success in the growing Asian aviation 
market, where the company is committed to playing a key role in developing the industry by offering a wide range of 
solutions,' said Marc Parent, CAE's Group president for the simulation products department.
CAE also announced separately that it has signed an agreement with Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer to 
form a global training joint venture.
The initial training program will be offered at CAE's SimuFlite operation in Dallas. There are also plans to expand to 
Western Europe and the eastern United States.
The joint venture will provide comprehensive pilot and ground crew training to Embraer customers of the Phenom 
100 Very Light Jet and Phenom 300 Light Jet aircraft.
CAE and Embraer will work together to develop all required courseware and provide a team of qualified instructors. 
As part of the training program, CAE will design and manufacture full-flight simulators and combine CAE Simfinity 
technology and devices into the Phenom training program.
CAE also said it won contracts to provide several unnamed airlines and aircraft manufacturers with CAE Simfinity 
PC-based training software.
Shares of CAE rose 27 cents, or 3.1 percent, to close at $9.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.

MADRID (AFX) - Shares in Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA were lower at midday, underperforming the broad 
market, as business visibility was further dented by news of additional low-cost competition on the airline's Madrid 
home turf, dealers said.
At 1.15 pm, Iberia had shed 0.02 eur to 2.25, off a low of 2.23, on volume of about 15.3 mln shares.
The IBEX-35 index had slipped 29.8 points to 13,206.8.
Yesterday, Ryanair Holdings PLC announced plans to open a base in Madrid by November, following hot on the 
heels of EasyJet's announcement of six new routes out of its new hub in Madrid.
'This is bad news for Iberia, as the announcement came as a surprise since Ryanair had previously said Madrid 
was not one of its priorities,' said Santander Investment analysts.
At Madrid airport, 60 pct is connecting traffic, 10 pct is business, and 'only 30 pct is really exposed to LCCs,' the 
analysts noted.
Deutsche Bank analysts agreed that increased competition from low-cost carriers is expected to limit the upside in 
Iberia's share price, noting that Madrid 'is a lucrative opportunity where penetration is still low.'
The German bank also highlighted the uncertainty related to fuel prices as likely to weigh on Iberia's stock price.
'We see... limited scope for upside re-rating due to the uncertainty related to fuel and mainly competition from 
LCCs,' they said.
Market watchers will be looking for an update from Iberia on the impact of increased low cost-competition at its 
Madrid base, as well as on its fuel hedging position, at its upcoming Investor Day on Oct 30.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael O'Leary believes staff at Aer Lingus Group PLC could yet 
support his surprise 1 bln stg bid for the Irish national carrier, despite the trenchant opposition of trade unions and 
the Dublin government, The Sunday Times reported.
O'Leary reportedly told the newspaper that the cash offered -- 2.8 eur a share -- was a powerful incentive to airline 
workers and that a way could be found around potential tax penalties.
Individual Aer Lingus staff own thousands of shares through an employee share ownership plan that amounts to a 
12 pct stake.
'There are baggage handlers here in Dublin who could be looking at 60,000 eur. I would be very surprised if the 
employee share ownership plan does not in the end vote in favour of our bid,' O'Leary said.
However, the newspaper said sources close to Aer Lingus scoffed at the idea that the employee share plan might 
vote for O'Leary, saying the special tax advantages enjoyed by the scheme would be lost if the bid was accepted.
'The other point is that most of the staff at Aer Lingus frankly regard O'Leary as the devil incarnate,' one company 
adviser reportedly told the newspaper.
The Ryanair bid came only days after Aer Lingus floated in Dublin and London.
Ryanair is expected to issue an offer document within weeks. City sources said it was likely the airline would gauge 
the attitude of competition authorities to its bid, and then consider an increase, perhaps up to 3.00 eur a share, 
according to the article.
A separate article in The Sunday Telegraph said Irish trade unions have reportedly threatened O'Leary with 
industrial action if Ryanair gains control of Aer Lingus.
Over the weekend, plans have emerged in the Irish press to reduce Aer Lingus' annual costs from 800 mln eur to 
650 mln eur, with the loss of 1,000 jobs.

DUBLIN (AFX) - Ryanair's surprise hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus is difficult to understand given that the state 
plans to retain a blocking minority in the company, Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen confirmed on Friday.
The government is committed to maintaining its share of at least 25.1 pct in recently privatised Aer Lingus which is 
designed 'among other things, to block any hostile takeover attempt', he said in a statement.
'Even if another company buys up a majority share, Aer Lingus would have to continue to operate on an 
independent financial basis.
'Against the backdrop where the company cannot be de-listed, the announcement by Ryanair is hard to 
comprehend.
'Without delisting, and operational integration with Ryanair, it is hard to see how the synergies which motivate 
mergers and takeovers could be realised.
'The information put out by Ryanair does not resolve this fundamental question. Ryanair investors must be unsure 
what this is all about,' Cullen said.
The 25.1 pct share ensures that another company cannot acquire the 75 pct threshold that is required to force a de-
listing and the threshold cannot be changed without the consent of the state.
The statement by Cullen said that one possible reason for the bid of 1.481 bln eur is that Ryanair's move is a 
defensive ploy to tackle the threat of competition
'What Ryanair is suggesting is a return to a monopolistic situation. A new monopoly in the provision of air services 
would be bad for business, the country, the consumer, the travelling public and tourism interests.'
Cullen also suggested that a Ryanair takeover might also violate conditions in an Ireland-US bilateral air 
agreement.
'That agreement requires that any airline designated by Ireland to provide transatlantic services must be majority 
owned and controlled by Irish nationals.
Ryanair 's bid for Aer Lingus 'hard to comprehend' - government
'There is a serious risk that the merged entity that Ryanair envisages would not meet that requirement and that is 
something that would need to be legally reviewed and ultimately may need to be discussed with the US authorities 
and the Irish government'.

STOCKWATCH Ryanair cut to 'neutral' by HSBC , to 'hold' by ABN Amro on valuation

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair PLC have been downgraded to 'neutral' from 'overweight' by HSBC and to 
'hold' from 'buy' at ABN Amro on valuation grounds following Ryanair's 1.48 bln eur bid launched yesterday for rival 
Aer Lingus Group PLC, dealers said.
On Thursday, the Irish no-frills airline revealed that it had built up a 16 pct stake in the Irish flag carrier and offered 
2.80 eur per share in cash for the former state-owned airline's remaining shares.
But Ryanair's plan to create a Dublin-based long- and short-haul airline seemed to evaporate as first the Irish 
government, and then Aer Lingus, firmly rebuffed its overtures.
Responding to the news this morning, HSBC said it believes the transaction has strategic merit for Ryanair and is 
affordable, but added that it is a potential distraction from the carrier's focus on delivering the lowest cost European 
air travel.
Given the execution risks and the proximity of Ryanair's share price to the broker's 8.80 eur price target, HSBC 
downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'overweight'.
And ABN Amro also cut its recommendation, telling investors to 'hold' the shares rather than 'buy', as previously 
advised, as the share price has traded through the broker's 8.10 eur price target.
The broker said the bid for Aer Lingus took it totally by surprise, and added that it does not think it will succeed 
because of competition policy and government opposition.
ABN Amro also said it thinks Ryanair recognises that the bid may well fail, but sees publicity, potential political 
capital and maybe even a small speculative gain from the move anyway.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair PLC edged higher in opening deals after Aer Lingus Group PLC rejected the 
no-frill airline's 1.48 bln eur bid for the Irish national carrier, dealers said.
Yesterday, Ryanair revealed it had built up a 16 pct stake in the newly listed flag carrier and offered 2.80 eur per 
share in cash for the former state-owned airline's remaining shares.
But Ryanair's plan to create a Dublin-based long- and short-haul airline seemed to evaporate as first the Irish 
government, and then Aer Lingus, firmly rebuffed its overtures.
In response to the bid, a host of brokers cut their rating on the group with HSBC downgrading the stock to 'neutral' 
from 'overweight', ABN Amro to 'hold' from 'buy' on valuation and Dresdner Kleinwort to 'hold' from 'add'.
HSBC said it believes the transaction has strategic merit for Ryanair and is affordable, but added that it is a 
potential distraction from the carrier's focus on delivering the lowest cost European air travel.
Given the execution risks and the proximity of Ryanair's share price to the broker's 8.80 eur price target, HSBC 
downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'overweight'.
And ABN Amro also cut its recommendation, telling investors to 'hold' the shares rather than 'buy', as previously 
advised, as the share price has traded through the broker's 8.10 eur price target.
The broker said the bid for Aer Lingus took it totally by surprise, and added that it does not think it will succeed 
because of competition policy and government opposition.
ABN Amro also said it thinks Ryanair recognises that the bid may well fail, but sees publicity, potential political 
capital and maybe even a small speculative gain from the move anyway.
Meanwhile, Dresdner Kleinwort cut its stance on Ryanair to 'hold' from 'add' with a raised price target of 9 eur from 
8.
The broker said Ryanair sees a chance to make a fast buck: using cash that earns only 3 pct, buying Aer Lingus 
would be earnings accretive up to a price of 6 eur per share.
However, it questioned whether Ryanair should be sitting on a mountain of cash in the first place.

Instead, shareholders might prefer to see the bid fail, then Ryanair might finally be forced to match its efficient 
operations with an efficient balance sheet, the broker said.
At 8.09 am, shares in Ryanair were 0.08 eur higher at 8.70.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet PLC were over 1 pct higher in morning trading after Europe's second largest 
no-frills airline raised its guidance for full year pretax profit after a better-than-expected revenue performance in 
September.
At 9.15 am the stock was up 7-3/4 pence at 505-3/4 pence, valuing the business at 2.07 bln stg.
The Luton-based carrier said it now expects pretax profit for the year to Sept 30 2006 to be 'slightly ahead' of its 
previous guidance of growth of 40-50 pct.
In the year to end-Sept 2005 easyJet made a pretax profit of 82.6 mln stg.
In September easyjet carried 3.0 mln passengers, an increase of 9.8 pct on the same month last year.
Load factor, a measure of how full planes are, was 86.5, an increase of 0.1 percentage points on September last 
year.
For the year to Sept 30 easyJet's revenue increased 20.7 pct to 1.62 bln stg. Unit revenue (total revenue per seat) 
rose 7.8 pct. The airline carried 32.9 mln passengers, up 11.5 pct, and its load factor was 84.8 pct, down 0.4 
percentage points on the previous year.
Citigroup reiterated its 'buy' stance, noting it was already forecasting profit growth of 58 pct.
The broker reckons easyJet shares may benefit from switching out of Ryanair Holdings PLC if investors want to 
maintain low cost carrier exposure in Europe without the Dublin-based carrier's acquisition risk.
Yesterday, Aer Lingus Group PLC rejected a 1.48 bln eur hostile offer from Ryanair.

LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC said its board unanimously rejects this morning's hostile 2.80 eur per 
share offer for the group from no frills airline Ryanair Holdings plc.
Aer Lingus said the offer approach, which values the whole group at some 1.48 bln eur, is 'unsolicited, wholly 
opportunistic and significantly undervalues the group's businesses and attractive long term growth potential'.
Chairman John Sharman also said the offer would raise significant regulatory issues as a result of Aer Lingus 
Group's strong position in its core markets.
'Aer Lingus Group shareholders are strongly advised to take no action in relation to the offer.'
After Ryanair's announcement this morning, analysts said the group may face regulatory hurdles, although they 
noted that other recent mergers among European airlines had gone through without problems.
Ryanair announced it had bought a 16 pct stake in the state-owned airline.
However, the Irish Department of Transport said it would refuse to sell its 34.8 pct stake in the airline, which listed 
on the London and Dublin stock markets earlier this week at a price of 2.20 eur per share.
Irish finance minister Brian Cowen and the Minister for Transport, Martin Cullen, said in a statement: 'The 
government remains fully and firmly committed to competition in aviation markets. It will not sell its shares in Aer 
Lingus.'
Ryanair needs a majority of Aer Lingus' shares to complete the deal.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC ticked higher in midday trade, reversing earlier falls, as investors 
digested news the low-cost airline has made an 1.48 bln eur offer for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus PLC, dealers said.
At the same time, Ryanair revealed it has taken a 16 pct stake in the former state-owned airline.
In response, Deutsche Bank reiterated its 'sell' rating on Ryanair as it delivered a cautious verdict on the mooted 
deal.
Referring to the price tag, the broker said using consensus estimates it sees the 2.8 eur per share offer as six times 
2007 EV/EBITDAR estimates -- a 25 pct premium to the flag carriers.
In a note to clients, it said investors must consider 3 factors -- future strategic direction, implementation risks and 
will the offer succeed.
Ryanair plans to combine the businesses within the group but run them separately.
The broker said this moves its equity from being a low cost carrier pure play to having network carrier exposure -- 
and one in a weak market position versus its global peers.
Furthermore, it thinks Ryanair will have to convince the Irish government and employees of the benefits of the deal, 
as Aer Lingus' longhaul business growth depends on this 'goodwill'.
And it believes implementing the deal will be tough - to give one example, both companies have fundamentally 
different fleets.
Overall, it said bulls of Ryanair will argue this deal gives the company option value and financially it may be possible 
to justify the deal.
But Deutsche Bank said if the growth in short-haul is so good, why is a highly rated pure play low cost carrier 
bothering to move into the long haul market where companies have half the rating?
At 1.25 pm, shares in Ryanair rose 0.21 eur at 8.92, Aer Lingus gained 0.36 eur at 2.88 and peer easyjet took on 5 
pence at 495-1/2.

ROUNDUP Ryanair makes 1.48 bln eur offer for Aer Lingus , but faces govt hurdle

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday launched a 1.48 bln eur bid for rival Aer 
Lingus Group PLC, but faced immediate resistance from the Irish government.
Analysts said the group also may face regulatory hurdles, although they noted that other recent mergers among 
European airlines had gone through without problems.
Ryanair announced it had bought a 16 pct stake in Aer Lingus and was offering 2.80 eur per share in cash for the 
former state-owned airline's remaining shares.
The budget airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary described the all-cash offer as 'a unique opportunity to form 
one strong airline group for Ireland and for European consumers.'
O'Leary said Ryanair would run Aer Lingus as a separate entity within a larger group and would use its greater 
buying power to expand and improve the flag carrier.
However, the Irish Department of Transport said it would refuse to sell its 34.8 pct stake in the airline, which listed 
on the London and Dublin stock markets earlier this week at a price of 2.20 eur per share.
Irish finance minister Brian Cowen and the Minister for Transport, Martin Cullen, said in a statement: 'The 
government remains fully and firmly committed to competition in aviation markets. It will not sell its shares in Aer 
Lingus.'
Ryanair needs a majority of Aer Lingus' shares to complete the deal, and analysts said bilateral flying agreements 
dictated that 51 pct of the company has to remain in the hands of Irish nationals.
Peter Caldwell at Barclays Stockbrokers noted Dublin's response and said competition issues were also likely to 
arise, as the merger would leave one company dominating the Irish market.
However, he highlighted Ryanair's comment that there were 'plenty of precedents where national champions have 
been created by mergers in most other European states.'
'The government looks to be the main institution that Ryanair will need to persuade for the bid to be successful,' 
Caldwell said.
ROUNDUP Ryanair makes 1.48 bln eur offer for Aer Lingus , but faces govt hurdle
Andrew Fitchie at Collins Stewart said Ryanair currently had about 5 pct of the market and that would rise to about 
7 pct with the Aer Lingus deal.
However, he said the European airline sector was already very competitive and Ryanair would probably be 
prepared to give undertakings to overcome any concerns.
'I don't think any regulatory hurdles would be insurmountable,' Fitchie said.
In a statement earlier Thursday, O'Leary said Ryanair would expand, enhance and upgrade Aer Lingus and 
compete on the small number of routes they both operate - currently about 17 of the 500 or so services operated by 
the pair.
'We believe the price of 2.80 eur (per share) to be an excellent offer,' O'Leary said.
'If accepted, the Irish Government will realise over 500 mln eur from the sale of their Aer Lingus shares and the 
employees will realise over 220 mln eur, which equates to an average of over 60,000 eur per employee.'
Aer Lingus said in a statement it was considering the announcement and would make a statement in due course.
'In the meantime, Aer Lingus Group shareholders are strongly urged to take no action,' it said.
Ryanair said it did not believe the deal would raise major competition concerns, citing recent European airline 
mergers such as Air France-KLM.
The budget airline said it plans to keep the Aer Lingus management in place, although some job losses are likely at 
the flag carrier, which currently employs 3,500 people.
It said it also intends to retain the Aer Lingus brand, its slots at London Heathrow and all profitable routes while 
cutting its costs through improved efficiency and Ryanair's stronger purchasing power.
The budget carrier also said it will upgrade the flag carrier's transatlantic fleet and improve its long-haul service.
Ryanair said in a statement: 'Investing in Aer Lingus is attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders because, 
amongst other things, Aer Lingus's earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available on Ryanair's cash 
deposits.'
Fitchie described the move as a 'masterstroke' by Ryanair, provided it can get the approval of regulators and Aer 
Lingus's employee share trust.
The budget airline could secure more capacity to expand at Dublin airport by cutting Aer Lingus's unprofitable 
routes, he said.
'If they can do this, I think it will be good news for Ryanair,' Fitchie said.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Stocks fell on Thursday despite strength in retailers' September sales. In the opening minutes, 
the Dow Jones industrials lost 14.93 points to 11,835.68 and the Nasdaq eased 1.42 points to 2,289.53. The S&P 
500 dropped 1.37 points to 1,348.85.
On Wednesday, the Dow industrials set a new record for the second day in a row, with the Dow jumping 123 points, 
the Nasdaq Composite rising 47 points and the S&P 500 rising 16 points.
OPEC on Thursday moved to cut production by a million barrels a day, sending crude futures back above the $60-
a-barrel market in electronic trade. Crude for November delivery rose 68 cents to $60.09 a barrel.
Also on Thursday, cooler weather, falling gasoline prices and a burst of late back-to-school shopping gave a boost 
to retailers' sales in September.
A few companies released earnings Thursday as well, including Marriott International and Constellation Brands.
Drugmaker Wyeth lifted its earnings guidance for the year, citing the success of key pharmaceutical products.
The Labor Department reported Thursday that 302,000 persons filed claims last week, the smallest number to show 
up at unemployment offices since the week ending July 22.
A gauge of online U.S. employment recruitment slipped in September on reduced demand in the finance and real 
estate sectors. The Monster employment index fell to 172 in September from a record 173 in August, the online 
recruiting company said Thursday.
The U.S. dollar was flat against the euro and slightly weaker against the Japanese yen.
The dollar's move comes ahead of a European Central Bank interest rate decision, in which the Frankfurt bank is 
expected to lift its key interest rate to 3.25 percent from 3 percent.
Elsewhere, Corus Group, an Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, surged in London trading after India's Tate said it may try to 
buy the company.
Ryanair made an unsolicited $1.9 billion takeover offer for Aer Lingus, a rival Irish airline that flies trans-Atlantic 
routes. The Irish government, which owns part of Aer Lingus, said it won't be selling its stake.
Stocks drop in early trading
Overseas markets strengthened, with the Nikkei 225 surging 367 points, or over 2 percent, in Japan. European 
stock markets also rose, with the U.K. FTSE 100 up 0.6 percent.

LONDON (AFX) - German shares were higher late morning after the Dow posted its second consecutive record 
high close, ahead of the ECB rate setting meeting which is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, 
dealers said.
At 11.25 am, the DAX 30 index was up 36.13 points at 6,080.39.
The MDAX was up 42.08 points or 0.49 pct to 8579.04, while the TecDAX was up 4.09 points or 0.62 pct at 662.71.
Deutsche Bank was 1.58 eur higher at 98.44 eur as the Financial Times said it will unveil new 'ambitious' profit 
targets at an investor meeting today.
The newspaper quoted analysts as saying they expect Deutsche Bank to retain the 25 pct target but publish new 
targets for specific parts of its business.
Deutsche Boerse moved 1.03 pct higher. Henri Lachmann, author of a study on European stock market 
consolidation, called on Deutsche Boerse AG to merge its equities operation with Euronext NV.
In return, the German markets operator would receive a 15-20 pct stake in Euronext, the Schneider Electric 
supervisory board chairman said at the launch of his study, which he wrote for Paris Europlace, a lobbying group of 
major French companies.
PUMA was boosted by vague talk that Nike could be interested in making a bid, spurred on by an article in Focus 
magazine yesterday. The magazine said Nike might buy Mayfair's 25 pct stake in the sportswear group. Shares 
added 9.82 eur to 280.5 eur.
Thyssenkrupp got a lift -- up 1.05 eur at 27.29 eur after India's Tata Steel Limited confirmed recent press reports 
today that it is evaluating opportunities, including a possible approach to Anglo-Dutch steel firm Corus Group PLC.
Tata Steel said it is reviewing a number of global opportunities. Press reports put a possible Tata Steel offer at 
around 580 pence per share.
And Lufthansa was also boosted -- up 1.18 eur at 17.21 eur -- as ongoing speculation was fuelled by news Ryanair 
plans to buy recently floated Aer Lingus.
German shares up late morning, Infineon up on broker tip, lower oil adds support
SAP gained from the bullish mood in global markets and after sharp gains by the Nasdaq overnight. SAP was up 
2.85 eur at 160.5, but Infineon fell 0.1 eur to 9.44 eur on bearish comment. SG Secs cut its stance to
Continental added 1.73 eur to 93.33 eur as vague talk circulated that the tyre group has called an extraordinary 
board meeting for tomorrow.
E.ON fell 0.85 eur to 92.8 eur -- along with European peers -- as last week's speculation driven gains in the sector 
gave way to concern that any sector consolidation looks to be a long, drawn-out process.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Airline shares on Thursday gave back some of their strong gains from earlier in the week, as 
oil prices rebounded above $60 per barrel and Frontier Airlines cut its second-quarter profit outlook.
The Amex Airline Index fell 2.3 percent, with all 10 component stocks marking declines. The index had a strong 
week, climbing 5.4 percent from Monday through Wednesday on the back of cascading oil prices.
A barrel of crude gained 71 cents to $60.12 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after OPEC's president said the 
cartel is considering an emergency meeting to discuss cuts in output. Higher oil prices tend to hurt airlines stocks, 
as jet fuel is among the industry's biggest costs.
Also hurting shares was Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc. saying it expects second-quarter earnings per share to be 
between a penny and 5 cents, excluding items. The airline previously forecast quarterly profit in line with its first-
quarter results of 10 cents per share, while Wall Street anticipated 18 cents, according to a Thomson Financial 
analyst poll.
Frontier blamed the effects of the thwarted London bombing attempts, as several carriers said the ensuing 
heightened security drained away revenue. Frontier said its September unit passenger revenue fell 4.2 percent from 
year-ago levels.
Frontier shares fell 88 cents, or 10 percent, to $7.98 on the Nasdaq.
JetBlue Airways Corp. lost 5 cents to $9.58 on the Nasdaq. The low-cost carrier said earlier its September unit 
passenger revenue growth of 16 percent was in line with internal expectations.
AirTran Holdings Inc. slipped 4 cents to $10.26, Alaska Air Group Inc. lost $1.10, or 2.6 percent, to $40.82, and 
American Airlines' parent AMR Corp. dropped 32 cents to $23.93, all on the New York Stock Exchange.
Continental Airlines Inc. dipped 41 cents to $30.50, Southwest Airlines Co. dropped 26 cents to $16.53, and 
ExpressJet Holdings Inc., lost a penny at $6.88 -- all on the NYSE.
On the Nasdaq, Mesa Air Group Inc. gave up 10 cents to $8.02, and SkyWest Inc. lost 31 cents to $24.99.
Outside the index, US Airways Group Inc. slipped 78 cents to $46.68 on the NYSE, and United Airlines' parent UAL 
Corp. lost 60 cents, or 2 percent, at $29.15 on the Nasdaq.
Sector Snap: Airline shares fall
U.S.-listed shares of European discount carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC dropped $1.21 to $64.20 on the Nasdaq, 
after it launched a surprise bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus Group PLC.

The group said this new facility will save the DAA the 610 mln eur they propose spending on their Terminal 2, as 
well as saving the seven year old Pier C, which cost 150 mln eur, and the historic listed building, Corballis House.
Ryanair also confirmed that it would be oppose the DAA's planned Terminal 2, which it said is 'badly designed, in 
the wrong location, is five times more expensive than other similar terminal facilities in the UK and Europe, and has 
ballooned in cost from 170 mln eur when first announced by the DAA in September 2005 to 750 mln when the 
DAA's plans were finally revealed in August 2006'.

TARFAYA, Morocco (AFX) - In this fishing village on Morocco's southern coast, French writer Antoine de St-
Exupery dreamed of the faraway worlds visited by his immortal character, the Little Prince. Eighty years on, the 
haphazard cluster of salmon-colored buildings and the crenelated shell of a Spanish fort still oozes charm.
But Shaibata Merebbi Rebbo -- a native son, local history buff and contact for the United Nations Development 
Program -- feels the wide world pressing down on his home. He worries that Tarfaya's drowsy sepia-tinted 
existence risks being obliterated by mass tourism as Morocco's skies open to European budget airlines.
'The rhythm of mass tourism is very quick,' he said. 'All the things that used to be beautiful will change.'
This year, Morocco became the first African country to join Europe's flight zone. Loosened controls and slashed 
airport fees led budget pioneer Easyjet to start flights to Marrakech in July, and Irish rival Ryanair is set to arrive in 
late October. Fledgling Moroccan low-costers are joining the action, with startup Jet4you announcing new flights 
from Paris.
To fly to Morocco, Europeans used to have to pay big carriers like Air France, British Airways and Morocco's own 
Royal Air Maroc hundreds of dollars. In a devastating undercut, budget airlines are now offering return tickets from 
Europe for under $60.
Remote Tarfaya is still far from the budget airlines' initial bridgeheads in northern Morocco. But with Ryanair alone 
looking to expand to up to twenty Moroccan destinations, Merebbi Rebbo foresees a lot more foreigners visiting 
Tarfaya in coming years.
He hopes tourism will provide a much-needed economic boost, but also worries about the impact on local lifestyles 
and cultures.
'The municipality would have the money to create green spaces and improve the roads,' he said, plodding down a 
dusty alleyway. But tourism must be controlled, he added. 'If we need infrastructure to accommodate these people, 
it must respect the local architecture, not build high buildings.'
Some 500 miles to the north in Rabat, Morocco's tranquil capital, Tourism Minister Adil Douiri has ideas strikingly 
similar to Merebbi Rebbo's. In an interview, he said the government hopes to drum up some $7 billion between 
2001 and 2010 to develop major historic cities like Fes and Marrakech as weekend destinations for Europeans and 
Promise, peril in cheap fares to Morocco
attract others to upscale beach resorts for longer, sun-soaked stays. Most of the funding will come from private 
investors, he said.
Morocco hopes tourism will help lower chronic unemployment -- estimated at 20 percent in cities -- and modernize 
an economy still heavily grounded in agriculture.
'Tourism is the broadest industry in terms of job creation -- it's transport, it's retail, it's everything,' said the minister.
Key are budget airlines, which the government hopes will significantly boost tourist numbers from 5.8 million in 2005 
to 10 million a year by 2010.
Douiri said tourism will also help rescue crumbling historic towns and walled cities the government is unable to save 
by providing owners with cash to repair buildings and install modern utilities like running water and telephone lines.
Real estate agents are gearing up for more European vacationers and retirees as cheap air fares make commuting 
to and from Europe easier. They expect rents to rise and say developers are already getting ahead by building 
small studios and flats more suited to Westerners than the cavernous apartments meant for traditionally large 
Moroccan families.
Said French real estate agent Olivier Boisard, who caters mainly to French retirees moving to Morocco: 'The 
potential is enorme, enorme, enorme!'

to and from Europe easier. They expect rents to rise and say developers are already getting ahead by building 
small studios and flats more suited to Westerners than the cavernous apartments meant for traditionally large 
Moroccan families.
Said French real estate agent Olivier Boisard, who caters mainly to French retirees moving to Morocco: 'The 
potential is enorme, enorme, enorme!'

RABAT, Morocco (AFX) - Moroccan budget airline Jet4You will begin flights linking Casablanca with Paris and two 
Belgian cities in late October, taking on the Irish low-cost superstar Ryanair, which will start Europe-Morocco flights 
at the same time.
Jet4you's Paris-Casablanca flights will begin Oct. 29, with flights linking the Moroccan commercial capital to 
Charleroi and Liege, Belgium, set to start on Nov. 1, Jet4you's Casablanca office said Friday.
The fledgling airline, with just two planes at present, began flights between Paris and the Moroccan tourist centers 
of Fez, Marrakech and Agadir in February.
Morocco's entry this year into the European flight zone has opened the door to low-cost airlines looking to cash in 
on Morocco's growing popularity as a tourist destination for Europeans.
Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills airline, announced its first foray into Africa last month, with flights to the Moroccan 
cities of Fez, Marrakech and Oujda from London's Luton Airport, Hahn Airport north of Frankfurt, Germany, and the 
southern French city of Marseille.

UK to ease air travel restrictions imposed after terror alert

LONDON (AFX) - British authorities are set to ease security measures imposed on air travellers following the 
discovery of an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic airliners, officials said Wednesday.
The unprecedented measures slapped on airports and airlines last month included a ban on carry-on luggage, and 
brought widespread confusion to air terminals and prompted a rash of flight cancellations and delays.
But the Department of Transport said Wednesday that it was set to propose ways of easing the restrictions for 
travellers to the aviation industry next week, although it gave no details.
'We will be meeting with industry representatives next week to present to them new proposals aimed at lessening 
the burden on both passengers and operators while allowing us to maintain a rigorous security regime,' it said.
'The department will consider the views of industry representatives, other stakeholders and recent European Union 
discussions, and we intend to make an announcement later next week on new regulations,' it added.
The terror plot, revealed in August, apparently involved trying to smuggle innocuous-looking liquids onto flights that 
could then be assembled into bombs. Some two dozen people were taken into custody.
The air industry protested fiercely to authorities at the measures, which cost airlines fortunes. The British airports 
operator BAA, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, said this week it had cost 13 mln stg.
'We will never compromise on passenger security but we are always mindful that passengers should be able to 
travel as freely as possible,' said the Department of Transport statement.

LONDON (AFX) - Boeing has created a working group of key airline customers to evaluate a potential replacement 
for its best-selling 737 aircraft which could enter service as early as 2014, the Financial Times reported.
The US aerospace group is working with carriers such as Southwest Airlines, Ryanair and Brazil's Gol after naming 
an in-house team in February to examine options for a next-generation narrow body aircraft.
'It's pretty clear what the airlines are looking for,' it quoted Laura Wright, Southwest's chief financial officer, as 
saying. The Dallas-based carrier is the world's largest operator of 737s. It wants an aircraft of similar size but with 
lower fuel, operating and maintenance costs.
Boeing old the newspaper that no decision had been made on the timing or specifications for any 737 replacement.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Easyjet PLC have been downgraded to 'hold' from 'buy' on valuation by ABN Amro, 
dealers said.
In a note to clients, the Dutch owned broker pointed out that the shares have risen 32 pct in the past three months, 
compared with Ryanair's 12 pct increase and have now reached its target price of 460 pence.
It argued that it sees investor attention switching to 2007 from 2006 and expects unit revenue improvement to slow 
while unit costs face headwinds of security and operational integrity.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Inmarsat PLC pushed higher in late morning trade, extending yesterday's gains on a 
read-across from news that Ryanair Holdings PLC is set to equip its entire fleet of aircraft with OnAir's mobile 
communications solution from mid-2007 onwards, dealers said.
At 11.59 am, Inmarsat shares were 10-1/2 pence firmer at 360-1/2, with the FTSE 250 index up 15.3 points at 
9,596.8.
In reaction to the news, Dresdner Kleinwort reiterated its 'buy' stance on Inmarsat, with a 461 pence price target.
The broker noted that the OnAir service will use capacity on Inmarsat's satellites and said the move is supportive to 
its 38 pence valuation for the business opportunity, of which it includes 19 pence -- a 50 pct probability - in its 
current price target.
Dresdner Kleinwort noted that service providers OnAir and Aeromobile have now signed five airlines - Ryanair, 
Qantas, Air France, BMI, and TAP - for the new in-flight mobile service.
However, the broker pointed out that the Ryanair deal is significant as the other airlines have only announced that 
they will trial the service in 2006/07.
Dresdner Kleinwort noted that mobile communications have historically not been permitted on aircraft for safety 
reasons because they interfere with avionics systems but OnAir and Aeromobile use a successfully tested pico-cell-
based system which overcomes these concerns.
The broker pointed out that while the service has yet to be given regulatory approval, OnAir has been working 
closely with regulators throughout the process and approval in Europe is expected by the end of the year.

LONDON (AFX) - BAA PLC, which was taken over earlier this year by a consortium led by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial 
SA, today dismissed calls for the break-up of its UK airports from airlines such as British Airways PLC and easyJet 
PLC, arguing that a more fragmented ownership structure would undermine vitally needed investment in airport 
capacity.
In a submission to the Office of Fair Trading study on the UK Airports market, BAA urged the OFT to focus upon the 
true interests of consumers.
BAA chief executive Stephen Nelson said: 'I fully understand why airlines like British Airways and Ryanair want to 
weaken airport operators and achieve greater control over prices and investment at the airports where they hold 
such powerful positions themselves, but the job of the competition authorities is to
protect the longer term interests of all consumers.
He said the biggest problem facing UK air travellers is the shortage of airport capacity, especially in South East 
England. He said new runways need to be built.
But he said some airlines want to break up BAA and impose even heavier price
regulation.
'This have-it-both-ways proposal would be a poisonous cocktail for consumers.'
It risks setting back the investment programme which BAA is pursuing through projects like Heathrow Terminal 5, 
Heathrow East and the Stansted second runway.
BAA's final submission to the OFT argues that the airports market is highly
imperfect because most people use the airport closest to where they live, or
which offers flights to their preferred destination. The group also says the market is distorted by many unusual 
factors, such as airport slot allocation procedures and inter-governmental agreements on air services.
BAA rejects calls for break-up of UK airports
BAA says that the threat to investment from break-up will outweigh any possible benefits to consumers in terms of 
choice, price or quality of service. Nelson added: 'We are not saying that the current situation is perfect and we 
welcome the OFT's review, so long as it is wide-ranging and evidence-based.'

NEW YORK (AFX) - Airline stocks were mixed in Wednesday morning trading, after a Prudential analyst 
downgraded three low-cost and regional carriers but said the overall industry looks favorable, with no signs of 
weakening air travel demand in sight.
The Amex Airline Index was up a half percent, with most of its 10 carriers showing price changes of less than 1 
percent. The index is down about 13 percent since its early July peak, but has regained some ground in the past 
week.
Helping all stocks was crude's continued decline, with the price of a barrel falling 51 cents to $69.20 on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange. Airline stocks are highly sensitive to oil prices, with jet fuel among the industry's top 
costs.
Prudential analyst Bob McAdoo said he continues to rate the overall airline industry as favorable, with carriers 
seemingly able to offset fuel-price pressures with fare increases. He sees companies he rates as 'Overweight' -- 
including American Airlines parent AMR Corp., Continental Airlines Inc. and US Airways Group Inc. -- regaining 
their July peak prices by the end of the year.
But McAdoo singled out JetBlue Airways Corp., MAIR Holdings Inc. and Pinnacle Airlines Corp. for downgrades. He 
cut JetBlue to 'Neutral Weight' from 'Overweight,' and lowered the two regional carriers to 'Underweight' from 
'Neutral Weight.'
JetBlue is in the midst of restructuring and has said it sees profit for the rest of this year being close to break even. 
McAdoo set his 2007 earnings per share projections for JetBlue at 40 cents, above Wall Street's average view of 27 
cents, according to an analyst poll by Thomson Financial.
Separately, the analyst said he thinks the final resolution of Pinnacle's contract with Northwest Airlines will likely be 
delayed until early 2007. McAdoo also said Mesaba's contract for new flying for Northwest is up for renegotiation, 
and MAIR shares could fall further if the process is derailed.
Shares of McAdoo's three downgraded carriers all dropped, with JetBlue down 10 cents to $10.31 on the Nasdaq.
MAIR fell 15 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $5.05, and Pinnacle Airlines lost 25 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $6.90, both on 
the Nasdaq.
Sector Snap: Airline stocks mixed
McAdoo also initiated coverage on Ryanair Holdings PLC, one of Europe's top low-fare carriers, with an 
'Overweight' rating and price target of $72. U.S. shares of the company gained 22 cents to $54.78 on the NYSE.
Other carriers marked gains, with US Airways in the lead, up $1.14, or 2.7 percent, at $43.44 on the New York 
Stock Exchange.
Shares of AirTran Holdings Inc. rose a modest 7 cents to $11.45, and Alaska Air Group Inc. added 17 cents to 
$37.37, both on the NYSE. AMR Corp. gained 21 cents to $20.35, and Continental Airlines picked up 42 cents to 
$25.30, also on the NYSE.
Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc. shares gained 7 cents to $6.85, while SkyWest Inc. rose 11 cents to $24.39, both on 
the Nasdaq. ExpressJet Holdings Inc. gained a penny to $6.75 on the NYSE, while Mesa Air Group Inc. rose 5 
cents to $7.71 on the Nasdaq.
United Airlines parent UAL Corp. rose 22 cents to $24.96 on the Nasdaq. Southwest Airlines Co. shares were 
unchanged at $17.40 on the NYSE.

MADRID (AFX) - Shares in Grupo Ferrovial SA were lower in early deals, after some of the UK's biggest airlines 
yesterday called on UK competition watchdogs to launch an in-depth investigation into Britain's airport sector, 
dealers said.
The Spanish constructor has recently made a stellar debut in the sector with the acquisition of airports operator 
BAA, which owns London Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.
British Airways PLC yesterday called for BAA to be broken up.
In a morning note, Dexia Equities said this newsflow 'is not good for Ferrovial's momentum and reduces visibility in 
the short-term.'
The investment house noted, however, that yesterday's statements from BA, EasyJet and Ryanair might have been 
prompted by the security chaos witnessed at UK airports earlier this month, 'which became the last straw in the 
tense relationship existing between the airlines and BAA' over the past few years.
Ibersecurities echoed this view and the fact that Office of Fair Trading is already carrying out a review of 
competition and regulation in the airlines industry.
But the local brokerage said it 'values negatively for Ferrovial' this (most recent) pressure on the competition 
authorities, 'as this might affect the investigation.'
Dexia analysts were more upbeat, noting that Ferrovial still has 'room to maneouvre and negotiate with the airlines,' 
highlighting that the UK government has not yet backed up the airlines' claims.
The Spanish builder has also yet to present its new capex plan, which is believed to call for a reduction of BAA's 
previous ambitious investment drive, it added.
'Our 71 eur per share fair value estimate for Ferrovial does not assume any value creation from the BAA buy,' Dexia 
added.
At 9.50 am, Ferrovial was down 0.15 eur at 60.60, off a low of 60.50, on volume of about 93,600 shares.

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Hldgs today is expected to launch legal action against the UK government 
over chaos at British airports following the terror alert earlier this month.
Ryanair confirmed a BBC radio report claiming that it would be making an announcement this morning about action 
over the disruption, although it declined to give details.
The company last week threatened to sue the government for 2 mln stg over the flight delays and cancellations 
caused by extra security measures imposed following the discovery of an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic 
flights.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline would launch the action unless ministers restored hand baggage 
allowances and body searches to normal levels within seven days.

LONDON (AFX) - Some of the UK's biggest airlines today called on UK competition watchdogs to launch an in-
depth investigation into Britain's airport sector.
British Airways PLC, easyJet PLC and Ryanair Hldgs said they believed the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which is 
carrying out a review of competition and regulation in the industry, should refer the findings of its study to the 
Competition Commission for a more detailed probe.
BA said in its response to the OFT review that the commission should recommend improvements to airport 
regulation and should break up airports operator BAA, which owns London Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
In a separate statement, no-frills carrier easyJet PLC also appealed for the dismantling of BAA and warned that 
tougher regulation was needed.
And fellow budget carrier Ryanair said in its own submission to the OFT that it had detailed 'a number of abuses' by 
BAA that would justify an OFT reference to the Competition Commission.
BAA, which has been taken over by a consortium led by Spanish construction firm Grupo Ferrovial SA, owns seven 
UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
A spokesman for the group welcomed the OFT inquiry, saying evidence to date suggested the current ownership 
structure of UK airports serves the public interest well.
'Any intervention aimed at increasing competition in the market would need to demonstrate clearly that the benefits 
to consumers would outweigh potential disadvantages such as the reduced likelihood of investment, he said.
'That's a very big test, and we need to see the argument.'
Almost two-thirds of British air passengers begin or end their journey at BAA's airports, according to the OFT. 
Within the London area, nine out of ten passengers fly through a BAA airport.
The OFT said in June that it was launching a consultation to determine whether the current market structure was 
working well for consumers.
It said it would publish the findings of its study later this year and that it may refer the findings of the review to the 
Competition Commission if a more in-depth investigation is needed.
ROUNDUP Airlines call for in-depth investigation into UK airport sector
BA said in its submission that the commission should consider separate ownership of London Heathrow and 
London Stansted.
The UK flag carrier's chief executive Willie Walsh said his company believes decisions about building new runways 
in south east England should not be concentrated in the hands of one company.
'Separate ownership of London Heathrow and London Stansted would make infrastructure developments at the 
airports more responsive to airlines' and their customers' needs and expansion at one airport would not be held 
back to suit the commercial needs of a monopoly owner,' he said.
Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs and company secretary, Jim Callaghan, said: '(We are) calling on the OFT to 
recommend a break-up of this monopoly as the most effective means of introducing competition into this important 
market.'
EasyJet said travellers across Britain must be protected from paying higher air fares.
'Consumers need better protection from the airport operators who behave like local monopolists, pushing up prices 
to hide their own inefficiencies,' said easyJet chief executive Andy Harrison.
'So, whilst easyJet supports the break-up of BAA, the primary focus must be on tougher regulation.
'The issue of ownership is secondary to providing the right regulatory regime.'

LONDON (AFX) - Some of the UK's biggest airlines today called on UK competition watchdogs to launch an in-
depth investigation into Britain's airport sector.
British Airways PLC, easyJet PLC and Ryanair Hldgs said they believed the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which is 
carrying out a review of competition and regulation in the industry, should refer the findings of its study to the 
Competition Commission for a more detailed probe.
BA said in its response to the OFT review that the commission should recommend improvements to airport 
regulation and should break up airports operator BAA, which owns London Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
In a separate statement, no-frills carrier easyJet PLC also appealed for the dismantling of BAA and warned that 
tougher regulation was needed.
And fellow budget carrier Ryanair said in its own submission to the OFT that it had detailed 'a number of abuses' by 
BAA that would justify an OFT reference to the Competition Commission.
BAA, which has been taken over by a consortium led by Spanish construction firm Grupo Ferrovial SA, owns seven 
UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
A spokesman for the group welcomed the OFT inquiry, saying evidence to date suggested the current ownership 
structure of UK airports serves the public interest well.
'Any intervention aimed at increasing competition in the market would need to demonstrate clearly that the benefits 
to consumers would outweigh potential disadvantages such as the reduced likelihood of investment, he said.
'That's a very big test, and we need to see the argument.'
Almost two-thirds of British air passengers begin or end their journey at BAA's airports, according to the OFT. 
Within the London area, nine out of ten passengers fly through a BAA airport.
The OFT said in June that it was launching a consultation to determine whether the current market structure was 
working well for consumers.
It said it would publish the findings of its study later this year and that it may refer the findings of the review to the 
Competition Commission if a more in-depth investigation is needed.

BA said in its submission that the commission should consider separate ownership of London Heathrow and 
London Stansted.
The UK flag carrier's chief executive Willie Walsh said his company believes decisions about building new runways 
in south east England should not be concentrated in the hands of one company.
'Separate ownership of London Heathrow and London Stansted would make infrastructure developments at the 
airports more responsive to airlines' and their customers' needs and expansion at one airport would not be held 
back to suit the commercial needs of a monopoly owner,' he said.
Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs and company secretary, Jim Callaghan, said: '(We are) calling on the OFT to 
recommend a break-up of this monopoly as the most effective means of introducing competition into this important 
market.'
EasyJet said travellers across Britain must be protected from paying higher air fares.
'Consumers need better protection from the airport operators who behave like local monopolists, pushing up prices 
to hide their own inefficiencies,' said easyJet chief executive Andy Harrison.
'So, whilst easyJet supports the break-up of BAA, the primary focus must be on tougher regulation.
'The issue of ownership is secondary to providing the right regulatory regime.'

LONDON (AFX) - Unions at Stansted airport have called off a proposed bank holiday weekend strike after 
accepting a pay offer, the BBC reported.
Baggage handlers and check-in staff had threatened to walk out in a dispute with ground handling company 
Swissport, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA.
But after three days of talks, the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&G) and GMB said they had agreed to an 
improved salary deal.
The BBC cited the GMB as saying Swissport had offered an 11 pct rise over two years, and it would recommend its 
members accept the offer.
It said the unions had suspended strikes pending a ballot of members.
The news will come as a relief to two of Stansted's biggest customers -- the no-frills carriers Ryanair Holdings PLC 
and easyJet PLC.
The BBC added that planned strikes on the Gatwick Express airport train service over the holiday weekend were 
also suspended yesterday.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said it expects to operate a full schedule 
of flights to and from London Stansted airport over the bank holiday weekend even if a planned strike by 500 check-
in and baggage handling workers, employed by Swissport and belonging to the GMB union, goes ahead.
The carrier said if the strike proceeds it will allow all passengers to use its web check-in facility. It has written to 
passengers today to advise them they may be required to web check-in and travel with no checked in luggage.
Last Friday the GMB announced its members would strike from 5.00 am Saturday Aug 26 to 8.00 am Sunday Aug 
27 and from 5.00 am Monday Aug 28 to 8.00 am Tuesday Aug 29.
The union is in dispute with Swissport, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, over pay. It is seeking a substantial 
pay review for its members as well as a premium rate for Sunday working.
Stansted is Ryanair's largest UK base.
'Ryanair believes that the GMB and Swissport should sort out their differences without trying to blackmail the 
travelling public, however any strike if it proceeds will not be allowed to disrupt Ryanair's flights at Stansted next 
weekend,' it said.
Talks aimed at averting the strike will restart at 4.00 pm today. Discussions over the weekend failed to resolve the 
dispute.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in British Airways fell in early deals following weekend press speculation passengers 
could face a fresh surcharge on tickets to pay for the escalating price of airport security, dealers said.
The move is seen as an alternative to taxpayers footing the bill or the airline industry paying the tens of millions of 
pounds needed for more security staff, training and upgraded equipment, yesterday's Observer said.
And low-cost peer easyJet was also under the cosh, hit by news of a pending ground handlers strike at Standsted 
airport over this week's Bank Holiday weekend.
According to UBS, this will have an impact on both easyJet, which has around 20 pct of passengers flying from 
Stansted, and Ryanair. The airport handles 80 pct of the Irish-based airline's passengers.
At 8.36 am, shares in BA were down 4 at 393-1/4, easyJet lost 7 at 426 and Ryanair took on 0.03 at 7.20 eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Talks aimed at averting strike action by 500 check-in and baggage handling workers at London 
Stansted airport over the bank holiday weekend will restart this afternoon, said a spokesman for the GMB union.
He said talks with managers from Swissport, the ground handling agent owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, 
would resume at 4.00 pm. Discussions over the weekend failed to resolve the pay dispute.
The union is seeking a substantial pay review for its members as well as a premium rate for Sunday working.
The spokesman said he is not hopeful of a resolution.
'We're trying, but the company spent five hours yesterday and then came back to us with another offer that was 
exactly the same as previous offers made in June and since then,' he said.
Last Friday the GMB announced its members would strike from 5.00 am Saturday August 26 to 8.00 am Sunday 
August 27 and from 5.00 am Monday August 28 to 8.00 am Tuesday August 29.
As Swissport provides ground handling services for about 80 pct of passengers who use Stansted the stoppages 
will seriously disrupt both check-in and ground handling services on one of the busiest holiday weekends of the 
year.
The dispute will be bad news for both Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, the no-frills carriers already 
suffering from the security disruptions following the August 10 terror alert. Stansted is Ryanair's largest UK base, 
while easyJet accounts for around 20 pct of the airport's passengers.
Analysts reckon it will be difficult to replicate any service without the Swissport employees as it takes a lot of time to 
get new airside passes.
Stansted is owned by BAA, which was recently taken over by a consortium led by Grupo Ferrovial.
By 11.07 am shares in easyJet were down 3 pence at 430, shares in Ryanair were up 0.02 eur at 7.19 eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Security restrictions at British airports are to be made more 'manageable' within days, Trade and 
Industry Secretary Alistair Darling said after 10 days of travel misery for air passengers.
Darling told BBC News 24 television that government officials and ministers would ensure restrictions were 
'proportionate' to the level of threat to the country from terrorism.
Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander will meet BAA, the operator of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted, within the next week to resolve outstanding security issues, Darling added.
'Unfortunately it (the increased security) was necessary because of the intelligence we received to step up security,' 
he said.
'But I hope that in the next few days we can make sure that the system is manageable, is proportionate.'
Both the government and BAA have been heavily criticised in the last week because of the measures, which were 
brought in after an alleged aircraft bomb plot was foiled.
Airlines, in particular low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair, have said there were insufficient staff to carry out extra body 
searches and handle more hold baggage following a ban on cabin luggage, leading to delays and cancellations.

ROUNDUP Ryanair may claim 2 mln stg from UK govt for airport chaos

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC today accused the UK government of 'inaction and 
stupidity' in handling last week's terror alert and warned it may demand 2 mln stg in compensation unless security 
returns to normal next week.
The carrier said it plans to write to the UK's Department for Transport to demand 'immediate restoration' of normal 
international security measures at Britain's airports.
It said it may claim compensation, to which it said it is entitled under UK law, unless airports are allowed to restore 
body searches and hand baggage allowances to normal in the next seven days, or receive more staff to speed up 
checks.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport dismissed Ryanair's comments about compensation and said it had 
no plans to change security in the coming week.
The security crackdown imposed in the wake of last Thursday's terror alert led to the cancellation of hundreds of 
flights and long delays at major UK airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
At a press conference in London today, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary accused the UK government of 
'inaction and stupidity' over the way it handled the situation.
Flanked by an actor posing as Winston Churchill and a screen bearing the words Let's Keep Britain Flying, O'Leary 
said the extraordinary measures had left more than 100,000 passengers stranded at UK airports and resulted in 
about 1,000 cancelled flights.
'We have got to the end of this week where the inaction, and in some cases stupidity, of the UK government has 
caused massive delays for flights and passengers,' he said.
O'Leary said his airline supported the action that the government and the British police took to thwart the alleged 
plot to blow up aircraft flying from the UK to the US.
However, he said he believed the government had failed the British people by failing to send in 'a couple of 
hundred' extra police or soldiers to help with the security checks.
ROUNDUP Ryanair may claim 2 mln stg from UK govt for airport chaos
It was 'completely unreasonable' to expect the airports to meet the extra security demands with their existing 
resources, he said.
'We're still faced with Keystone Cop-like security measures which are just serving to block up airports and delay 
flights,' he told reporters.
He said elderly people and children going on holiday with their families were being treated as 'terrorist suspects' 
and harmless hand baggage items were being banned.
'All this is wasting valuable time and security resources,' O'Leary said.
'If the Home Office and the Department for Transport believes we're in danger from bottles of water, ladies' 
cosmetics and toothpaste, you have to ask why these things are still allowed on the London Underground.
'These measures are handing the terrorists and extremists a public relations victory because the UK government is 
failing to get airports back to normal.
'These people must be rolling around the caves in Pakistan laughing at us.'
O'Leary said government claims that airports were operating normally were not true. Airport staff were having to 
work emergency rosters and overtime to ensure that flights depart on time and managers were depending on staff 
goodwill, which could not be relied upon indefinitely, he said.
Reports today said Ryanair baggage handlers were planning to take industrial action over the extra workload, 
although this could not be immediately confirmed.
O'Leary, who also announced a seat sale in August and September to entice people back onto Ryanair's services, 
said the disruption would not hinder the growth of low-cost airlines.
'This is not about that, it's about preventing the terrorists of Walthamstow, or wherever they come from, from 
disrupting our daily lives,' he said.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said Ryanair was basing its claims about potential entitlement to 
compensation on the wrong Act of Parliament.
'The security regime in place at UK airports is necessary because of the level of security threat and is kept under 
constant review,' he said.
'We have no intention of compromising security levels, nor do we anticipate changing our requirements in the next 
seven days.'
'The Department for Transport directs aviation security measures under Aviation Security Act 1982, not the 
Transport Act 2000 as Ryanair mistakenly seem to believe.'

It said it may claim compensation, to which it said it is entitled under UK law, unless airports are allowed to restore 
body searches and hand baggage allowances to normal in the next seven days, or receive more staff to speed up 
checks.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport dismissed Ryanair's comments about compensation and said it had 
no plans to change security in the coming week.
The security crackdown imposed in the wake of last Thursday's terror alert led to the cancellation of hundreds of 
flights and long delays at major UK airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
At a press conference in London today, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary accused the UK government of 
'inaction and stupidity' over the way it handled the situation.
Flanked by an actor posing as Winston Churchill and a screen bearing the words Let's Keep Britain Flying, O'Leary 
said the extraordinary measures had left more than 100,000 passengers stranded at UK airports and resulted in 
about 1,000 cancelled flights.
'We have got to the end of this week where the inaction, and in some cases stupidity, of the UK government has 
caused massive delays for flights and passengers,' he said.
O'Leary said his airline supported the action that the government and the British police took to thwart the alleged 
plot to blow up aircraft flying from the UK to the US.
However, he said he believed the government had failed the British people by failing to send in 'a couple of 
hundred' extra police or soldiers to help with the security checks.
ROUNDUP Ryanair may claim 2 mln stg from UK govt for airport chaos
It was 'completely unreasonable' to expect the airports to meet the extra security demands with their existing 
resources, he said.
'We're still faced with Keystone Cop-like security measures which are just serving to block up airports and delay 
flights,' he told reporters.
He said elderly people and children going on holiday with their families were being treated as 'terrorist suspects' 
and harmless hand baggage items were being banned.
'All this is wasting valuable time and security resources,' O'Leary said.
'If the Home Office and the Department for Transport believes we're in danger from bottles of water, ladies' 
cosmetics and toothpaste, you have to ask why these things are still allowed on the London Underground.
'These measures are handing the terrorists and extremists a public relations victory because the UK government is 
failing to get airports back to normal.
'These people must be rolling around the caves in Pakistan laughing at us.'
O'Leary said government claims that airports were operating normally were not true. Airport staff were having to 
work emergency rosters and overtime to ensure that flights depart on time and managers were depending on staff 
goodwill, which could not be relied upon indefinitely, he said.
Reports today said Ryanair baggage handlers were planning to take industrial action over the extra workload, 
although this could not be immediately confirmed.
O'Leary, who also announced a seat sale in August and September to entice people back onto Ryanair's services, 
said the disruption would not hinder the growth of low-cost airlines.
'This is not about that, it's about preventing the terrorists of Walthamstow, or wherever they come from, from 
disrupting our daily lives,' he said.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said Ryanair was basing its claims about potential entitlement to 
compensation on the wrong Act of Parliament.
'The security regime in place at UK airports is necessary because of the level of security threat and is kept under 
constant review,' he said.
'We have no intention of compromising security levels, nor do we anticipate changing our requirements in the next 
seven days.'
'The Department for Transport directs aviation security measures under Aviation Security Act 1982, not the 
Transport Act 2000 as Ryanair mistakenly seem to believe.'

ROUNDUP Air Berlin buys rival DBA

FRANKFURT (AFX) - German budget carrier Air Berlin PLC said it has acquired smaller rival DBA in a bid to 
expand its flight network and gain more business customers, prompting its shares to surge.
Air Berlin said it will pay a mid double-digit mln eur amount for DBA, a former unit of British Airways PLC, but 
declined to disclose the exact price.
The deal, which was signed late yesterday, is still subject to anti-trust clearance in Germany, which Air Berlin 
expects will be granted in September.
Air Berlin and DBA have cooperated in ticket sales since last November, when they announced customers could 
buy tickets of both airlines on each other's websites.
The takeover is a further step in the consolidation of the competitive German airline sector, where Air Berlin is 
fighting for market share alongside low-cost rivals like Ryanair Holdings PLC, Easyjet PLC and flag carrier 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
The news was greeted by investors. At 3.22pm, Air Berlin shares were up 0.98 eur or 9.90 pct to 10.88.
Uwe Weinreich, an analyst at HVB, said the tie-up made sense and 'given the expected synergies, the price is 
adequate. DBA needed a partner'.
Air Berlin, which will pay for the DBA takeover with its own liquid funds, said the deal will have no negative impact 
on its earnings this year and predicted a 'significant profit' for 2006.
The acquisition is expected to generate total synergies of 71 mln eur until 2008, of which 31 mln will be realised in 
2007 and 40 mln in 2008.
'Acquiring our dream partner was an opportunity not to be missed,' Air Berlin chief executive Joachim Hunold said.
'The route networks of Air Berlin and DBA complement each other superbly
because there are no over-laps.'
He said the acquisition will allow Air Berlin to gain access to DBA's airport slots, including key slots in Munich and 
Duesseldorf.
ROUNDUP Air Berlin buys rival DBA
Air Berlin flies to popular holiday destinations in Europe, while DBA's strength lies in carrying business travellers 
across Germany.
'We can integrate DBA's domestic routes in our European network without any
problem, thereby achieving a clear increase in the number of business travellers
using our airline,' Hunold said.
DBA carried around 4.3 mln passengers on its 29 planes and achieved sales of
404 mln eur in its 2005/2006 financial year through March. Air Berlin has a fleet of 58 aircraft and counted 13.5 mln 
passengers in 2005.
Together, the companies expect to carry around 20 mln passengers this year.
DBA will continue to operate as an independent company under the umbrella of Air Berlin, with Martin Gauss and 
Peter Wojahn to remain as managing directors.
Air Berlin's finance chief Ulf Huettmeyer said that while DBA posted a 30 mln eur operating (EBIT) loss in its last 
fiscal year, it managed to make a profit in the first quarter.
British Airways sold DBA to German investor Hans-Rudolf Woehrl three years ago for a symbolic price of 1 eur. 
Woehrl is also majority shareholder of German charter airline LTU, which has been cooperating with both Air Berlin 
and DBA.
LTU said in a statement today it will continue to cooperate with both companies and that its shareholder structure is 
not affected by the takeover.
In response to the news, Lufthansa said the takeover does do not change the overall industry situation in the 
country.
'We have up to now been confronted by tough competition in Europe and we
have asserted ourselves successfully,' a Lufthansa spokesman said.
He argued the tie-up would not bring any additional capacity into the market.

LONDON (AFX) - Low-cost airlines have shrugged off analyst concerns that tough restrictions on carry-on baggage 
introduced in the wake of last Thursday's terrorist alert could threaten their business models if they are made 
permanent and have insisted the industry will continue to thrive just as it did after 9/11.
A new regime introduced by the UK government on Monday limits passengers' hand luggage to one small cabin 
bag no bigger than 45cm by 35cm by 16cm -- the size of a small laptop case. Airlines expect the new rules to 
remain for the foreseeable future.
The allowance is less than half the size travellers were able to take on board before last Thursday's foiling by police 
of an alleged plot to blow-up planes flying between Britain and the US. Liquids and aerosols, including toothpaste, 
shaving foam and deodorant, have been banned from all hand luggage indefinitely.
Over the last couple of years the no-frills players had been encouraging passengers to carry more hand luggage, 
enabling them to make savings on baggage handling charges and improve aircraft turnaround times. These have 
been cut to just 25 minutes for Europe's biggest two no-frills carriers -- Dublin-based Ryanair Holdings PLC, which 
flies 351 routes across 23 countries, and Luton-based easyJet PLC, which flies 267 routes across 21 countries.
Indeed last March, Ryanair moved to discourage passengers from checking in baggage for the hold at all by 
introducing a fee of 3.50 eur per bag if booked in advance on its website or 7.00 eur per bag if presented unbooked 
at the airport. The initiative mirrored an earlier move by smaller rival Flybe.
easyJet had resisted introducing charges for checked-in baggage but was understood to be considering it.
Analysts fear continuing restrictions on hand luggage will mean more baggage shifting to the hold and hence higher 
ground handling costs and extended turnaround times.
'It will be interesting to see how this evolves but certainly the market is starting to think there could be some 
pressure on their business models,' said one.
'They can't start hitting everybody with a charge for hold baggage when passengers don't want to put it in the hold 
but are being forced to do so by the government.'
FOCUS Budget airlines dismiss fears luggage rules could hit business model
Analysts are also worried the new restrictions could significantly hit demand from the business community as the 
days of travelling with just a suit carrier and a briefcase could be over.
But the no-frills airlines regard such talk as scaremongering.
'All the same people who predicted the death knell of low-cost airlines after Sept 11 are predicting the death knell of 
low-cost airlines now, purely because we can't take such big handbags on board,' noted Toby Nicol, easyJet's head 
of corporate communications.
'The low-cost airline model is significantly more robust than that,' he maintained.
Nicol explained that the fundamental components of easyJet's business model are based around the quick 
turnaround of aircraft, the efficient use of resources with no waste, selling direct to consumers, not providing 
connecting flights, high load factors and yield management.
'Those are the pillars of the low-cost airline model, it's nothing to do with baggage,' he insisted.
He said the assumption that the new restrictions will inevitably lead to a greater volume of bags going into the 
aircraft hold is critically flawed.
'Why not incentivise passengers to take a single piece of hold luggage so you might actually end up with less,' he 
asked. 'Or you find a way of charging for baggage which incentivises people. Anything is possible.
'We're going to come out of this pretty well, I can absolutely guarantee that.'
Ryanair's Peter Sherrard was similarly dismissive of analyst fears and insisted the carrier has no plans to re-think 
its policy of making passengers pay to check-in luggage.
'The idea of charging for baggage is to reduce the amount of baggage people carry,' he said.
And if, in the short term, the new rules mean more luggage in the hold the airline will cope. 'It's very simple to load 
more bags into the hold, it doesn't take any additional time to do it,' he argued. And the increased revenue from this 
will offset the costs.
He also stressed the international nature of Ryanair's business, noting the vast majority of the 113 airports it 
operates to throughout Europe have had little or no disruption since Thursday.
Consequently Ryanair will not be adjusting its pricing strategy. 'The average fare last year was 28 stg and we've 
already told the markets that we don't think it will change significantly in the current year,' said Sherrard.
Meanwhile, analysts are continuing to tot-up the costs airlines are estimated to have incurred since Thursday. They 
reckon Ryanair and easyJet's bill will likely be about 10 mln stg each, with British Airways PLC facing a 50 mln stg 
hit and Virgin Atlantic some 15 mln stg.
The airlines want BAA, the operator of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, along with the 
government to make a contribution and are considering legal action.
They have been critical of the handling of the crisis by BAA, recently acquired by a consortium led by Spain's Grupo 
Ferrovial SA, maintaining it was not prepared and failed to provide enough staff to carry out the extra security 
checks.
Analysts believe the airlines have a case but believe some of their criticism is brinkmanship given that the Office of 
Fair Trading is currently investigating BAA's dominant position in London.

MADRID (AFX) - Grupo Ferrovial SA is unlikely to suffer any long-term fallout from security concerns at its BAA-run 
airports after last week's foiled terrorist plot alleged to have targeted flights to the US, analysts said.
'The noise arising from this is mostly a mudslinging exercise by all concerned and won't do any lasting damage to 
Ferrovial,' Andy Murphy at London-based brokerage Panmure Gordon said.
'While investors should be prepared for such occasional and short-lived events, this does not affect our long-term 
view of BAA's (positive) fundamental valuation as a regulated business and its contribution to Ferrovial,' an analyst 
at a leading Spanish bank added.
BAA is facing possible lawsuits from UK-centred carriers, notably British Airways, for its alleged mishandling of the 
logistical fallout from the terror alert.
The airports operator might reportedly also see its bonds downgraded by credit agencies on concerns over higher 
security costs and loss of earnings as people shy away from air travel.
Concerns over a expensive legal battle and soaring costs have shaved some 7 pct from Ferrovial's share price 
since Aug 7, the day before last week's events.
'We believe this is an over-reaction,' an analyst at JP Morgan said, estimated that 'some 75 pct of the additional 
costs of heightened security at BAA's single-till airports can be passed through to higher (airport fees).'
'Hence there may be a moderate impact on BAA's earnings from the remaining 25 pct of additional costs.'
If higher costs due to tighter security regulations do not hit the company's bottom line, BAA's bonds could well be 
saved from a downgrade.
'If business drops dramatically, then maybe we will see a ratings change, but no one is predicting that,' said a trader 
at a Spanish brokerage.
FOCUS Ferrovial to avoid long-term fallout from UK airport security concerns
'There'll be some slapped wrists from authorities, but this won't affect foot traffic through BAA's biggest earner, the 
duty-free stores.'
Analysts in Spain were equally dismissive of any long-term damage to Ferrovial from the threat of legal action.
'We don't believe BA could win a lawsuit against BAA over the problems caused by terrorist threats,' an analyst at 
Espirito Santo Research said.
The leading Spanish bank analyst agreed, noting: 'We believe the airlines are trying to save face with their 
customers who suffered the inevitable consequences of this event.'
Panmure Gordon's Murphy agreed, but did not rule out BAA making financial compensation to carriers.
'No one wants to go to court. There will be a quiet settlement, the finger-pointing will end and everyone will go back 
to the business,' he said.
As growth in Spain's construction sector continues to slow, and builders continue to diversify, many traders were 
not phased by the hiccup in Ferrovial's further expansion into airport management business through BAA, and 
remained convinced of the operator's value for the group.
'Ferrovial's stock price will bounce back soon enough, because the BAA acquisition was right for the company,' a 
trader at a local brokerage said.

LONDON (AFX) - UK travellers are enduring a sixth day of disruption and delays at UK airports despite yesterday's 
relaxation by the government of restrictions on airline hand baggage.
BAA PLC, which owns seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, stressed that although the 
nation's security level has been downgraded to 'severe' from 'critical' strict security remains in place in the wake of 
last Thursday's foiling of an alleged plot to blow-up planes flying between Britain and the US by police.
'Delays are likely, and anyone travelling over the next few days is asked to allow extra time for their journey and to 
arrive at the airport prepared,' it said in a statement.
Passengers are now permitted to carry one item of cabin baggage through the airport security search point. 
However, the allowance (45 cm by 35 cm by 16 cm) is less than half the size they were able to take on board 
before last Thursday's alert.
Some items, such as liquids and aerosols, remain prohibited. Extra restrictions remain in place for flights from the 
UK to the US.
British Airways PLC anticipates cancelling about 20 pct of its flights operating out of Heathrow. It plans to operate a 
full longhaul schedule from Gatwick but 11 domestic flights have been cancelled.
It also cautioned that flights that are running remain subject to delays.
A spokeswoman for the UK flag carrier said it is 'seriously considering' legal action against BAA for lost earnings. 
Over the weekend BA's chief executive Willie Walsh criticised the airport operator's handling of the crisis.
BAA was taken over this summer by a consortium led by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, last night described the government's revised security 
measures as 'nonsensical and ineffective' and said delays and cancellations will continue.
It noted that twice the number of passengers passing through the x-ray security machines must now be searched.
'If the government wants to double the number of security checks, it must provide the extra staffing (army or police 
personnel) to allow the London airports to carry out these checks without causing mass delays and cancellations,' it 
said.
TERROR ALERT UK air travellers face sixth day of disruption
Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported the revised restrictions on hand luggage are set to become permanent.
It said ministers have told BAA they do not envisage 'fundamental' changes to the new regime.
At 8.57 am shares in BA were down 3-1/2 pence at 373-1/2.

LONDON (AFX) - UK travellers are enduring a sixth day of disruption and delays at UK airports despite yesterday's 
relaxation by the government of restrictions on airline hand baggage.
BAA PLC, which owns seven UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, stressed that although the 
nation's security level has been downgraded to 'severe' from 'critical' strict security remains in place in the wake of 
last Thursday's foiling of an alleged plot to blow-up planes flying between Britain and the US by police.
'Delays are likely, and anyone travelling over the next few days is asked to allow extra time for their journey and to 
arrive at the airport prepared,' it said in a statement.
Passengers are now permitted to carry one item of cabin baggage through the airport security search point. 
However, the allowance (45 cm by 35 cm by 16 cm) is less than half the size they were able to take on board 
before last Thursday's alert.
Some items, such as liquids and aerosols, remain prohibited. Extra restrictions remain in place for flights from the 
UK to the US.
British Airways PLC anticipates cancelling about 20 pct of its flights operating out of Heathrow. It plans to operate a 
full longhaul schedule from Gatwick but 11 domestic flights have been cancelled.
It also cautioned that flights that are running remain subject to delays.
A spokeswoman for the UK flag carrier said it is 'seriously considering' legal action against BAA for lost earnings. 
Over the weekend BA's chief executive Willie Walsh criticised the airport operator's handling of the crisis.
BAA was taken over this summer by a consortium led by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, last night described the government's revised security 
measures as 'nonsensical and ineffective' and said delays and cancellations will continue.
It noted that twice the number of passengers passing through the x-ray security machines must now be searched.
'If the government wants to double the number of security checks, it must provide the extra staffing (army or police 
personnel) to allow the London airports to carry out these checks without causing mass delays and cancellations,' it 
said.
TERROR ALERT UK air travellers face sixth day of disruption
Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported the revised restrictions on hand luggage are set to become permanent.
It said ministers have told BAA they do not envisage 'fundamental' changes to the new regime.
At 8.57 am shares in BA were down 3-1/2 pence at 373-1/2.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are tipped to start the week higher as news the government has lowered its 
terrorism alert level overnight helps to offset a weak close on Wall Street on Friday, dealers said.
According to Finspreads, the FTSE 100 will open around 35 points firmer at 5,855, having closed on Friday down 
3.30 at 5,820.10.
Meanwhile, Wall Street also ended last week under pressure as investors feared stronger-than-expected retail 
sales could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year.
In response, the DJIA fell 36.34 points at 11,088.03, the S&P 500 was off 5.07 at 1,266.74, and the Nasdaq lost 
14.03 at 2,057.71.
And interest rates worries are likely to overshadow the US markets this week with the release of wholesale-inflation 
figures on Tuesday followed by consumer data the following day.
Over in Asia the mood was mixed as the Nikkei index ended the morning up 237.26 at 15,802.28, while the Hang 
Sang started the afternoon session off 0.24 at 17,249.71
Still in Asia, oil prices slipped back on hopes a UN-brokered truce and the eventual deployment of an international 
peacekeeping force in Lebanon will end the conflict.
Sentiment was further boosted as BP said it will keep part of its
Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska working, guaranteeing about half the oil field capacity, despite major pipeline 
closures.
Earlier this morning, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in September, was at 73.70 usd a 
barrel, down 0.65 usd from its close of 74.35 usd in the US Friday.
Back in London, investors should welcome news the government downgraded its security threat level from 'critical' 
to 'severe' as it appeared police apprehended all of the main figures in an alleged terror plot.
And at the same time, the Department for Transport said on its website following the security level downgrade 
passengers would now be allowed one piece of hand baggage, although the ban on carrying non-essential liquids 
would remain.
London shares outlook - higher as UK govt lowers level of terrorist threat
Nevertheless, British Airways could still be hit by the after-effects of last weeks' terror threat after the national 
carrier said it has cancelled 20 pct of short-haul flights and five long-haul flights from London Heathrow today.
The airline also said it also expects to cancel all domestic flights from London Gatwick airport, excluding flights to 
Jersey.
Smaller-cap peers Ryanair and Easyjet have also flagged flight cancellations.
Elsewhere, with little in the way of corporate news penciled into today's diary, investors will turn to the weekend 
press for inspiration.
M&A hopes could give an early fillip to the under fire gaming sector after a report in the Sunday Times said Harrah's 
Entertainment is mulling a move into the UK casino market.
The paper said the world's largest gaming group is studying a proposal to buy Stanley Leisure and London Clubs 
International.
And consolidation talk could also boost utilities after the Sunday Telegraph claimed Guy Hands' private equity firm 
Terra Firma has lined up a 5 bln stg debt package to help finance a bid for RWE's UK unit Thames Water.
The banks advising Terra Firma, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers will lead the 
financing, which also includes 2 bln stg of equity, the paper added.
Furthermore, it said a rival consortium led by the Qatar Investment Office has also put financing in place for a bid.
Still in M&A, the same paper said Signet's largest shareholder, US-based Harris Associates, joined smaller 
investors and dismissed a mooted 2.3 bln stg offer for the Anglo-American jewellery retailer as too low.
Earlier this month, private equity groups Apax and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts confirmed they considered making an 
offer for the world's largest jewellery retailer.
And Morgan Crucible, the maker of ceramics and defence materials, which last week said it had received a 
takeover approach, is unlikely to entertain an offer below 300 pence, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
Meanwhile, the drawn-out bidding war over commercial kitchen equipment group Enodis is expected to come to a 
head today with US rival Middleby, deciding this weekend whether to make a fresh approach for the UK company, 
The Sunday Times claimed.
And in retail, Iceland's Baugur is set this week to launch a formal 350 mln stg offer for House of Fraser to take the 
department store private, newspapers including The Sunday Telegraph and Express reported.
The Telegraph said the 148 pence per share offer is expected within days, but quoted sources close to Baugur as 
warning that it could slip back to next week.
Elsewhere, ITV will continue to be in focus after a report in The Observer said the troubled broadcaster wants the 
former head of Channel 4, Michael Jackson, to take the reigns when outgoing CEO Charles Allen steps down in 
October.
Allen announced his departure this month in the face of mounting shareholder pressure following a near-30 pct drop 
in the share price since turning down a 130 pence per share bid from a private equity consortium.
Still in the sector, Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of the world's second largest advertising and marketing services group, 
WPP, will warn the UK advertising market is set to remain tough when he unveils interim results on Friday.
The Sunday Telegraph said he will say the UK remains one of the toughest and most challenging advertising 
markets in the world.
London shares outlook - higher as UK govt lowers level of terrorist threat
In earnings, Michael Page is expected to post a pretax profit of 45.5-47.4 mln stg, up over 50 pct on the 30.5 mln 
stg previously.
But the main focus will be on the UK's second-largest recruitment agency's outlook statement, with some investors 
worried about US prospects.
Other companies set to report results today include Bema Gold Corporation and Betcorp.
Turning to economics, in a busy week for data, all eyes will be on release of the minutes from the Bank of England's 
rate setting committee on Wednesday.
The Monetary Policy Committee is expected to have voted unanimously for the shock quarter point hike in the repo 
rate to 4.75 pct at its meeting on August 3.
But before then, this morning's input prices data is expected to have risen a monthly 1.0 pct on a seasonally-
adjusted basis due to higher fuel costs, more than reversing June's 0.2 pct decline.
Meanwhile, unadjusted output prices are set to have risen 0.4 pct over the month, up from June's 0.1 pct.
And figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government are expected to show that house prices 
increased by an annual 5.6 pct in June, unchanged on the May rate.

UK airport bomb scare bad news for low cost carriers - aviation consultancy
UK airport bomb scare bad news for low cost carriers - aviation consultancy

SYDNEY (AFX) - The UK airport bomb scare will mean stricter controls on hand baggage which could be bad news 
for low-cost airlines at a time when they are beginning to charge passengers for checked baggage to encourage 
them to carry more in the cabin, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said.
The Sydney-based aviation industry consultancy said low-cost carriers (LCCs) had hoped to reduce handling costs 
and aircraft turnaround time by charging extra for checked luggage.
It said the move would have given LCCs greater asset utilisation as aircraft manufacturers were looking at installing 
larger inflight baggage bins in response to the new strategy.
'LCCs, at least in Europe like Ryanair, may be worse affected, perhaps in the long term too,' CAPA said.
It said the tightened security in response to the foiled London terror plot alleged to have been planned by Islamic 
extremists marks a watershed in airport security with passenger checks throughout the world likely to be 
significantly tightened.
'Hand baggage will probably never be the same again at least for UK, US flights,' the aviation consultancy said.
'This promises to be a significant inconvenience for travellers, especially on long-haul flights, as many flights are in 
the Asia Pacific region.'
For the time being, only wallets and passports, in plastic see-through packets, are permitted, but laptops or MP3 
music players are not.
The consultancy firrm does not expect a significant reduction in passenger numbers across the world but tightened 
security will undoubtedly temporarily result in some reduction in flight bookings and some cancellations.
'Passengers today, however, are very resilient and less ready to over-react to what, at this stage, appears to be a 
particularly UK-US issue,' CAPA said
It said security focus is likely to change because of the unveiling of plans by the alleged terrorists to construct 
bombs on board using hard to identify substances.
'In the past, the focus has been on screening for weapons and similar implements,' CAPA said.
UK airport bomb scare bad news for low cost carriers - aviation consultancy
'Here the problem has been elevated to another level, where a combination of substances can become life 
threatening.'
CAPA said the main ingredient to be used in the planned attacks being alleged was a liquid chemical, as well as 
components which can be easily disguised in a laptop, MP3 music players or camera equipment.
For the time being, CAPA said there is likely to be a blanket prohibition on any of these items on board at least on 
flights involving the US and UK.
CAPA said the terrorist scare could prompt airlines in the short to medium term to offer more discounts to keep load 
factors up, within Europe and on flights to and from Europe and the US.
But with all the other forces at work in the market at present, these effects are likely to be only part of overall 
challenges facing the industry, as fuel prices bite and economies slow.
In turn, CAPA said, this will impact on some airline share prices.
It noted UK and US carriers immediately saw share price falls of 5 pct and more.
'This is peak season in the North Atlantic and a time when many less-frequent travellers take to the air; they are the 
ones who are more likely to be affected negatively by the terror threat and media coverage and, paradoxically, to be 
attracted back into the air by cheap prices,' it said.
CAPA said the scare will also hurt shares of airport operators, especially in the UK, and have a negative impact on 
the sales of duty-free liquor at points of departure, at least until tamper-proof containers and procedures are 
introduced.
In Australia, shares of Macquarie Airports, majority owner of the nation's largest airport Sydney Airport, as well as 
those of flag carrier Qantas Airways Ltd, were lower on Friday.
At 2.40 pm, Macquarie Airports was down 0.09 aud or 2.98 pct at 2.93 while Qantas was down 0.02 or 0.66 pct at

SYDNEY (AFX) - The UK airport bomb scare will mean stricter controls on hand baggage which could be bad news 
for low-cost airlines at a time when they are beginning to charge passengers for checked baggage to encourage 
them to carry more in the cabin, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said.
The Sydney-based aviation industry consultancy said low-cost carriers (LCCs) had hoped to reduce handling costs 
and aircraft turnaround time by charging extra for checked luggage.
It said the move would have given LCCs greater asset utilisation as aircraft manufacturers were looking at installing 
larger inflight baggage bins in response to the new strategy.
'LCCs, at least in Europe like Ryanair, may be worse affected, perhaps in the long term too,' CAPA said.
It said the tightened security in response to the foiled London terror plot alleged to have been planned by Islamic 
extremists marks a watershed in airport security with passenger checks throughout the world likely to be 
significantly tightened.
'Hand baggage will probably never be the same again at least for UK, US flights,' the aviation consultancy said.
'This promises to be a significant inconvenience for travellers, especially on long-haul flights, as many flights are in 
the Asia Pacific region.'
For the time being, only wallets and passports, in plastic see-through packets, are permitted, but laptops or MP3 
music players are not.
The consultancy firrm does not expect a significant reduction in passenger numbers across the world but tightened 
security will undoubtedly temporarily result in some reduction in flight bookings and some cancellations.
'Passengers today, however, are very resilient and less ready to over-react to what, at this stage, appears to be a 
particularly UK-US issue,' CAPA said
It said security focus is likely to change because of the unveiling of plans by the alleged terrorists to construct 
bombs on board using hard to identify substances.
'In the past, the focus has been on screening for weapons and similar implements,' CAPA said.
UK airport bomb scare bad news for low cost carriers - aviation consultancy
'Here the problem has been elevated to another level, where a combination of substances can become life 
threatening.'
CAPA said the main ingredient to be used in the planned attacks being alleged was a liquid chemical, as well as 
components which can be easily disguised in a laptop, MP3 music players or camera equipment.
For the time being, CAPA said there is likely to be a blanket prohibition on any of these items on board at least on 
flights involving the US and UK.
CAPA said the terrorist scare could prompt airlines in the short to medium term to offer more discounts to keep load 
factors up, within Europe and on flights to and from Europe and the US.
But with all the other forces at work in the market at present, these effects are likely to be only part of overall 
challenges facing the industry, as fuel prices bite and economies slow.
In turn, CAPA said, this will impact on some airline share prices.
It noted UK and US carriers immediately saw share price falls of 5 pct and more.
'This is peak season in the North Atlantic and a time when many less-frequent travellers take to the air; they are the 
ones who are more likely to be affected negatively by the terror threat and media coverage and, paradoxically, to be 
attracted back into the air by cheap prices,' it said.
CAPA said the scare will also hurt shares of airport operators, especially in the UK, and have a negative impact on 
the sales of duty-free liquor at points of departure, at least until tamper-proof containers and procedures are 
introduced.
In Australia, shares of Macquarie Airports, majority owner of the nation's largest airport Sydney Airport, as well as 
those of flag carrier Qantas Airways Ltd, were lower on Friday.
At 2.40 pm, Macquarie Airports was down 0.09 aud or 2.98 pct at 2.93 while Qantas was down 0.02 or 0.66 pct at 
3.03.
The S&P/ASX 200 was down 14.45 points or 0.28 pct at 4,938.8.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in British Airways PLC remained over 5 pct lower in midafternoon trade, with security 
concerns continuing to weigh, after British police revealed they had foiled a major plot to bomb US-bound 
passenger jets, dealers said.
By 3.20 pm British Airways shares were down 20 pence at 370, while the FTSE 100 was 60.5 points lower at 
5,800.0.
British Airways announced this morning that it has cancelled all shorthaul flights to and from London Heathrow for 
the whole of today in the wake of the attempted terrorist attacks.
In a statement BA said it is experiencing major disruption to its operations at Heathrow because of severe airport 
congestion, following the introduction of new security arrangements.
With long delays and cancelled flights at airports around the country, brokers cautioned clients that the alert could 
be a severe blow to passenger sentiment.
'The news and airport disruption is negative in the short term for all UK airlines, especially for BA at its busiest time 
of year,' Exane BNP told clients, reiterating its 'underperform' recommendation.
The French owned broker said it believes the main impact is likely to be on the long-haul sector of UK airlines and 
feels the impact could be equivalent to the effect of the baggage handlers' strike last year (estimated cost 35-40 mln 
stg).
Deutsche Bank was more optimistic however, saying although it sees a likely congestion/cancellation cost hit, it 
expects little revenue impact and feels that the low ratings of the European airline sector means that negative 
sentiment should also be priced in.
The broker however, voiced some concerns over increased security, saying it thinks security will remain very tight in 
the near term.
'We would also expect other governments to follow suit to some degree for UK inbound flights, and probably to take 
similar measures for their own airports,' it added.
STOCKWATCH British Airways remains under pressure amid heightened security fears
Deutsche repeated its 'buy' recommendation on BA.
Oriel Securities meanwhile, reiterated its 'add' recommendation.
'Inevitably, some passengers will be deterred from booking or travelling by either the disruption and delays or by the 
renewed threat of terrorist attacks,' it cautioned, but added that it would not expect this effect to be either significant 
or persistent.
Overall, the UK broker said it feels although any sentiment towards the airlines will be negative short-term, any 
severe sell-off should be viewed as a buying opportunity.
Elsewhere, Easyjet and Ryanair both fell over 2 pct after also cancelling flights in and out of the UK.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in British Airways PLC were nearly 4 pct lower in early trading as investors fretted at the 
immediate disruption, and medium term consequences, of the overnight foiling by police of a terrorist plot to blow up 
planes flying between the UK and the US.
At 8.09 am the stock was down 14 pence at 376 pence.
BA said it is experiencing severe delays to its operations as a result of the current security situation and warned 
some flights will be cancelled. It advised customers who do not need to travel today to stay at home.
The airline had been hoping for a trouble free holiday season this year. Last year's second quarter was ruined by 
the dispute at catering supplier Gate Gourmet and the two previous summers were hit by industrial action.
Last Friday, BA reported a 57 pct rise in first quarter pretax profit, reflecting higher passenger numbers, particularly 
customers travelling in business and first class.
The airline's revenue grew 12.5 pct in the first quarter and it raised its guidance for the full year to end-March 2007 
to growth of 6-7 pct from 5-6 pct previously.
Shares in easyJet PLC, the Luton-based no-frills airline, were down 17-3/4 pence, or 4 pct, at 405 pence, while 
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, was down 0.31 eur at 7.22 eur.
Shares in BAA PLC, the owner of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted that is currently 
being taken over by a consortium led by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, were unchanged at 933-1/2 pence.

(AFX) - LONDON -- Airline and travel company shares dropped sharply Thursday after British authorities reported 
that they thwarted a terrorist plot to blow up several aircraft in flight between the United States and the United 
Kingdom.
As heightened security measures caused long delays and canceled flights at airports around the country -- 
including Europe's busiest airport, London's Heathrow -- experts said the alert could be a severe blow to both 
industries.
'You will always see a selloff based on the headlines today, but investors and analysts will now be waiting to see 
the depth of issues,' said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.
British Airways PLC was one of the hardest hit because of its heavy exposure to the trans-Atlantic route. Its shares 
were down 3.9 percent to 374.50 pence ($7.15) in trading on the London Stock Exchange.
BA said it was experiencing severe operational delays Thursday and it was likely some flights would be canceled. It 
said people choosing not to travel Thursday would get a refund.
Budget airline easyJet PLC was 2.6 percent lower at 411.75 pence ($7.84) while fellow low-cost carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC was down nearly 2.8 percent (to $9.41).
The new security measures banning all hand luggage from all flights leaving the U.K. posed a logistical problem for 
Ryanair, which this year began charging customers for each bag they checked -- a policy that has swelled the 
volume of luggage carried on board their aircraft.
Among other airlines, Air France-KLM was down 2.8 percent to euro19.19 ($24.68) in Paris, while Lufthansa was 
down 3.2 percent at euro14.16 ($18.21) in Frankfurt.
The ban on hand luggage will also likely impact some retailers, who run tax-free franchises at airports. Retail 
operations are a major source of income for the airport operators like Ferrovial's BAA PLC. However, BAA was up 
marginally, 0.3 percent, at 936 pence ($17.88).

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares extended losses in midmorning deals, reeling from news the UK is on maximum 
terror alert after police claim to have foiled a plot to blow up several trans-Atlantic planes, dealers said.
At 9.56 am, the FTSE 100 was 80.1 points lower at 5,780.4, with its midcap peer slumping 121.3 to 9,207.8.
Volume was fair with 538 mln shares exchanging hands in 68,483 deals.
Unsurprisingly, British Airways was the main casualty, down 23 pence at 367, with the BBC reporting Heathrow 
airport has been closed to all incoming flights that are not already in the air.
Security has also been stepped up in all other UK airports, with the authorities banning hand baggage on planes, 
resulting it airlines warning passengers to expect severe disruption and delays to flights.
The drastic measures follow the arrest of 21 people overnight in the London area amid allegations terrorists plotted 
to detonate up to three explosive devices smuggled on to flights in hand luggage.
Other airlines were also hit, with smaller peers easyjet off 12-1/2 at 410-1/4, and Ryanair down 0.32 at 7.30, while 
leisure group InterContinental Hotels was down 27 at 838-1/2.
Still in the sector, midcap Whitbread shed 19 pence to 1,215, hit by news UBS cut its rating to 'reduce' from 'neutral' 
on valuation grounds.
Elsewhere, Royal & Sun slipped 3-1/4 to 130-1/4 as the insurer's interim results were met with a mixed reaction.
The group posted interim results at the top end of market expectations, with operating profits coming in at 409 mln 
stg, up from 329 mln stg in the same period last year, and ahead of expectations.
Merrill Lynch however, reiterated its 'sell' recommendation, noting that although profits were broadly in line, it 
expects them to peak this year and then slowly decline.
Peer Old Mutual was also under pressure, down 3 at 155 after posting an uninspiring trading update of its own.
The insurance group announced worldwide APE sales in the six months to June 30 were up 8 pct to 802 mln stg 
with mutual fund sales of 4.1 bln, 72 pct higher year-on-year.
London shares extend losses midmorning as terror plot rocks sentiment
Reacting to the update, Cazenove said the numbers were solid year-on-year, but a touch below consensus for both 
life and mutual funds.
In contrast, International Power was the only blue chip riser, 1-1/2 to the good at 307-3/4, after unveiling a 95 pct 
pretax rise in its first half-year to 280 mln stg from 142 mln stg. The energy group also announced it expects strong 
growth this year.
In response, JP Morgan reiterated its 'overweight' stance, as it described the results as 'strong' and topping its 
expectations.
On the second line, Spirent took on 1/4 to 41-3/4, reversing initial losses, as brokers warmed to in-line results from 
the telecoms technology group.
This morning, the group said pretax profit excluding one-off costs and share-based charges in the six months to 
July 2 rose to 6.1 mln stg from a 1.1 mln loss a year earlier.

COPENHAGEN (AFX) - Shares are expected to open lower after another weak performance on Wall Street 
overnight and amid growing concern over new terrorist attacks after the Britain's Scotland Yard thwarted a plot to 
blow up aircraft, dealers said.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares extended losses in midmorning deals, reeling from news the UK is on maximum 
terror alert after police claim to have foiled a plot to blow up several trans-Atlantic planes, dealers said.
At 9.56 am, the FTSE 100 was 80.1 points lower at 5,780.4, with its midcap peer slumping 121.3 to 9,207.8.
Volume was fair with 538 mln shares exchanging hands in 68,483 deals.
Unsurprisingly, British Airways was the main casualty, down 23 pence at 367, with the BBC reporting Heathrow 
airport has been closed to all incoming flights that are not already in the air.
Security has also been stepped up in all other UK airports, with the authorities banning hand baggage on planes, 
resulting it airlines warning passengers to expect severe disruption and delays to flights.
The drastic measures follow the arrest of 21 people overnight in the London area amid allegations terrorists plotted 
to detonate up to three explosive devices smuggled on to flights in hand luggage.
Other airlines were also hit, with smaller peers easyjet off 12-1/2 at 410-1/4, and Ryanair down 0.32 at 7.30, while 
leisure group InterContinental Hotels was down 27 at 838-1/2.
Still in the sector, midcap Whitbread shed 19 pence to 1,215, hit by news UBS cut its rating to 'reduce' from 'neutral' 
on valuation grounds.
Elsewhere, Royal & Sun slipped 3-1/4 to 130-1/4 as the insurer's interim results were met with a mixed reaction.
The group posted interim results at the top end of market expectations, with operating profits coming in at 409 mln 
stg, up from 329 mln stg in the same period last year, and ahead of expectations.
Merrill Lynch however, reiterated its 'sell' recommendation, noting that although profits were broadly in line, it 
expects them to peak this year and then slowly decline.
Peer Old Mutual was also under pressure, down 3 at 155 after posting an uninspiring trading update of its own.
The insurance group announced worldwide APE sales in the six months to June 30 were up 8 pct to 802 mln stg 
with mutual fund sales of 4.1 bln, 72 pct higher year-on-year.
London shares extend losses midmorning as terror plot rocks sentiment
Reacting to the update, Cazenove said the numbers were solid year-on-year, but a touch below consensus for both 
life and mutual funds.
In contrast, International Power was the only blue chip riser, 1-1/2 to the good at 307-3/4, after unveiling a 95 pct 
pretax rise in its first half-year to 280 mln stg from 142 mln stg. The energy group also announced it expects strong 
growth this year.
In response, JP Morgan reiterated its 'overweight' stance, as it described the results as 'strong' and topping its 
expectations.
On the second line, Spirent took on 1/4 to 41-3/4, reversing initial losses, as brokers warmed to in-line results from 
the telecoms technology group.
This morning, the group said pretax profit excluding one-off costs and share-based charges in the six months to 
July 2 rose to 6.1 mln stg from a 1.1 mln loss a year earlier.

LONDON (AFX) - UK blue chips remained significantly lower midday after the UK was put on maximum terror alert 
following an alleged foiled plot to blow up several trans-Atlantic planes, which is also expected to weigh heavily on 
Wall Street, dealers said.
At 11.50 am, the FTSE 100 lost 75.4 points at 5,785.1, albeit off midmorning lows of 5,752.6, with the broader 
indices also in the red.
Investor caution meant that volume was light, with 883.2 mln shares changing hands in 117,495 deals.
The terror alert in the UK is expected to also hit US trading this afternoon, with spread-bettors IG Index putting the 
DJIA to open 44 points lower at 11,045-11,051, extending yesterday's 97-point slump.
Although the US Department of Homeland Security has said there is no evidence of a terrorist plot in America, it 
has still placed US-bound passenger airplanes from the UK on the highest, or Severe (Red) threat alert.
The negative sentiment is likely to overshadow any potential positive economic data in the US today. Jobless 
claims are due this afternoon, with the market looking for a decline in claims last week to 313,000 from 315,000 in 
the previous week.
Monthly trade balance data is also scheduled to come out before the US open, with June's trade deficit seen 
widening to 64.5 bln from 63.8 bln usd in May.
However, sliding oil prices could offer some support across the Atlantic, with light crude prices down almost a dollar 
at 75.37 usd per barrel on Nymex.
In London, the declining crude price damaged UK oil majors, with BP down 8 pence at 611-1/2, extending recent 
losses on the back of its Prudhoe shut-down, and with Royal Dutch Shell 22 pence lighter at 1,928 and Cairn 
Energy down 44 pence at 2,041.
The main casualty, however, was British Airways, dropping over 4 pct or 16 pence at 374 on the back of the closure 
of Heathrow airport to all incoming flights that are not already in the air.

Security has also been stepped up in all other UK airports, with the authorities banning hand baggage on planes, 
resulting in airlines warning passengers to expect severe disruption and delays to flights.

to detonate up to three explosive devices smuggled onto flights in hand luggage.

leisure group InterContinental Hotels was down 30-1/2 at 835.
Elsewhere, Persimmon was under the cosh, dropping 36 pence at 1,211 after Cazenove cut its recommendations 
on a handful of UK housebuilders, bringing all those in its universe to 'in-line', following last week's surprise Bank of 
England interest rate hike.
The downgraded stocks, which were reduced to 'in-line' from 'outperform' all fell midday, with mid-caps Barratt 
Developments down 30-1/2 pence at 910, Bellway 28 lighter at 1,152, Redrow 13 lower at 470-1/4, Wilson Bowden 
slipping 17 at 1,584, and George Wimpey falling 7-3/4 at 454.
Among those reporting today, Smiths Group underperformed, losing 27 pence at 854-1/2 following a mixed trading 
update.
The group said it expects full-year headline pretax profits to be 'well ahead' of 2005 and in line with analysts' 
forecasts of about 485-490 mln stg, but also warned that a weaker US dollar and the recent rise in interest rates 
could have an impact.
In reaction, UBS argued that all divisions made progress as expected, although added that the 'steady' margin 
comment in aerospace may indicate slightly slower improvement than expected.
The broker repeated its 'neutral' stance and 860 pence target.
Still on the reporting front, Royal & Sun Alliance slipped a penny at 132-1/2 as the insurer's interim results were met 
with a mixed reaction.
The group posted interim results at the top end of market expectations, with operating profits coming in at 409 mln

expects strong growth this year.
In response, JP Morgan reiterated its 'overweight' stance, as it described the results as 'strong' and topping its 
expectations.
And SABMiller also outperformed, unchanged at 1,022, after Australian soft drinks manufacturer Coca-Cola Amatil 
said it has formed a joint venture with the UK brewer to sell and distribute imported premium beer in Australia.
London shares still lower midday amid terror alert, airlines down; NY seen down
The 50:50 joint venture between CCA and SABMiller, to be known as Pacific Beverages Pty Ltd, will initially import 
SABMiller's international premium beer brands, Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft and Pilsner Urquell into 
the Australian market.
On the second line, the situation was similar to that of the FTSE 100, with share price losers far outweighing the 
riser.
Among those mid-caps in positive terrain, Spirent Communications was the top performer, taking on 1-3/4 pence at 
43-1/4, reversing initial losses, as brokers warmed to in-line results from the telecoms technology group.
This morning, the group said pretax profit excluding one-off costs and share-based charges in the six months to 
July 2 rose to 6.1 mln stg from a 1.1 mln loss a year earlier.
And Aquarius Platinum also managed gains, up 4-1/2 pence at 903-1/2 after reporting a fourfold jump in full-year 
net profit to 85.6 mln usd from 20.95 mln in the prior year after record production and strong prices.
It also increased its full year dividend to 24 cents per share after an 18 cents final payout.
Responding to the results, Evolution Securities said this was a strong set of results, 5 pct above the broker's 
estimates, and reiterated its 'add' rating on the mining stock.
Meanwhile, on the downside, MyTravel fell 9-3/4 pence at 203 on the back of the UK terror alert, accompanied by 
First Choice which dipped 4 pence at 212-3/4.
And leisure group Whitbread also declined, shedding 41 pence at 1,193, hit by a UBS downgrade 'reduce' from 
'neutral' on valuation grounds, with the broker noting that bid speculation has buoyed the share price recently.

ROUNDUP BA Q1 opg profit up 19.9 pct, sees higher fuel costs and tougher outlook
ROUNDUP BA Q1 opg profit up 19.9 pct, sees higher fuel costs and tougher 
outlook

LONDON (AFX) - British Airways PLC on Friday posted higher first-quarter profits and raised its 2007 revenue 
forecast, but saw its shares fall after warning of worse-than-expected fuel and staff costs and a tough winter.
The UK flag carrier also declined to comment on an investigation by the UK's Office of Fair Trading and the US 
Department of Justice into alleged cartel activity surrounding fuel surcharges.
BA said a 4.3 pct hike in passenger numbers to 9,569,000 and more customers upgrading from economy to 
business or first class were behind the 19.9 pct surge in operating profit to 211 mln stg in the three months to June 
30.
The group said it expects total revenue in the year to March 2007 to improve 6-7 pct, up from previous guidance of 
5-6 pct, again due to the better mix between economy and premium travel and the impact of a record 2.7 point 
increase in passenger load factor -- how full its aircraft were -- to 78.3 pct.
BA, which in April launched a low fares initiative to fight off the challenge from no-frills carriers such as easyJet, 
Ryanair and BMIBaby, attributed the improvements to a marketing drive and a renewed willingness among 
companies to pay for business class travel for their staff.
However, the group said a 44.2 pct hike in fuel costs, a 7 pct rise in staff costs, lower hedging profits and the 
stronger US dollar had taken the shine off a 12.5 pct improvement in revenues to 2.32 bln stg.
It said it now expected fuel costs for the year to rise by 550-600 mln stg against last year. The group also said it 
anticipated costs excluding fuel, which were previously forecast to be flat, to be slightly higher this year as pension 
costs drive up staff costs.
BA's no-frills rival Ryanair said Tuesday that it expects a difficult winter as a result of the high oil price.
BA chief executive Willie Walsh said today that although BA made a profit on its short haul operations last year and 
intended to build on that this year, he 'would not necessarily disagree' with Ryanair about the outlook for the winter.
'It's going to be a year of two halves and it will be tougher in the second half,' he told journalists in a conference call.
Walsh also declined to comment on the OFT and DoJ probe into alleged cartel activity surrounding fuel surcharges.
ROUNDUP BA Q1 opg profit up 19.9 pct, sees higher fuel costs and tougher outlook
Although BA has said it is 'business as usual', it is assisting the OFT and DoJ with their inquiry and could face a fine 
of up to 10 pct of its turnover if it is found guilty.
'There's no update in relation to that and we won't be making any comment on it,' Walsh said.
At 12.20 pm, the group's share price was down 3 pct or 11 pence at 378, leaving it at the top of the FTSE 100 
fallers.
Claire Collingwood at CMC Markets said: 'Although (BA) posted a 20 pct rise in profits, investors were wary over 
the warning of a tougher second half due to the markdown of airlines' ticket prices, amid growing competition.'
Peter Caldwell at Barclays Stockbrokers described the results as good overall, but highlighted the higher-than-
expected non-fuel costs.
'Fuel costs are expected to be 550 mln stg-600 mln stg higher, which also looks to be worse than analysts were 
forecasting,' he said.
Walsh also said BA may need to cut future benefits enjoyed by members of the group's main final salary pension 
scheme to help reduce its growing pension deficit.
An ongoing actuarial valuation has shown that the deficit has grown from the 928 mln stg reported at the time of the 
last valuation in 2003, despite extra contributions made by the airline since then.
Although the full actuarial valuation is not yet known, BA said a valuation of the scheme under IAS 19 accounting 
rules showed that the deficit had risen by 101 mln stg to 2.1 bln stg by March this year.
The company said the work done on the full actuarial valuation so far showed that members' life expectancy had 
increased and that the scheme would need extra cash to pay out benefits at the current levels.
BA has told the members that it needs 'substantial cash reserves to withstand the volatile nature of the airline 
industry' and that it cannot afford to use all its cash reserves to pay off the deficit.
'If the necessary extra money is not available from either BA or from investment returns, future benefits may need 
to be reduced,' the group said in a letter to the scheme members.
BA said pretax profit in the three months to June 30 climbed 57.3 pct to 195 mln stg and basic earnings per share 
rose 65 pct to 13.2 pence.
For the three month period, group turnover was up 12.5 pct at 2.32 bln stg.
The company said it expects strong revenues to continue, supported by 'significant' marketing boosting seat factors 
in all cabin classes.
Capacity growth in the first half of the year is expected to be about 4 pct, slowing in the second half of the year to 
achieve a full year increase of 2.5-3 pct.

Italy's antitrust urges rethink of regulation on Sardinia air routes

MILAN (AFX) - Italy's antitrust authority said the transport ministry should rethink the public service obligations on 
air routes from Italy's mainland to Sardinia in order to boost competition.
Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC are already challenging as anti-competitive PSO obligations imposed by 
Italy's air regulator ENAC, which has barred them from operating some routes to Sardinia.
The present PSO mechanism, aimed at guaranteeing all-year-around, reasonably-priced flights 'present possible 
competition restrictions and make it necessary to rethink the system', the authority said.
In addition, the PSO rules allow airline companies to share out routes in agreement with ENAC, excluding 
competitive mechanisms, which could potentially reduce consumer tariffs on the routes, it said.
Specifically, the authority cited a recent code-share agreement between Alitalia SpA and Italy's Meridiana, which 
allows for collusion under PSO rules and goes against competitive habits.
In addition, the PSO has 'implicitly banned' low-cost airlines from flying to Sardinia, if they don't agree to these 
rules, and is damaging customers who cannot benefit from lower tariffs, it said.
For routes from Rome and Milan to Sardinia, the rules should be changed so as to limit PSO rules to certain times 
of the year, when the routes are less profitable for carriers, it said.
On other routes to Sardinia, from Turin, Verona, Florence, Bologna, and Palermo, where Enac has yet to choose 
PSO carriers, reduced competition is probably necessary, it said.
The European Commission recently opened its own inquiry into Enac's imposition of PSO rules on Sardinian 
routes.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is set to report a very strong set of trading figures when it reports its first-
quarter figures today.
The low-cost airline, which operates 330 routes, will benefit from the late Easter holiday break, which this time fell 
into April. Passenger numbers for the quarter are expected to rise by 25 pct to 10.7 mln.
Analysts expect profits -- on an EBIT basis -- to show a rise to around 120-127 mln eur, while revenues could climb 
to over 530 mln eur. In the corresponding period last year, the group reported EBIT of 80 mln and revenues of 405 
mln eur.
Ryanair has already forecast profits growth of between 5-10 pct for 2006-07, providing oil prices remain stable at 
around 70 usd a barrel. Fuel costs last year rose by 74 pct to 462 mln stg.
The airline reckons its annual fuel bill will rise by over 40 pct this year and is hedged up until October. Analysts 
reckon Ryanair may have put in place further hedging contracts and that this, together with continued strong 
revenue income, could result in a revision to its growth forecast.

INTERVIEW Ryanair rules out fuel surcharges

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Hldgs PLC ruled out copying its rivals by passing on the soaring cost of 
fuel to customers as it posted a better-than-expected 80 pct rise in net profits, but warned of difficult trading this 
winter.
Ryanair treasurer Jimmy Dempsey said the Dublin-based carrier had no plans to follow in the footsteps of 
competitors such as BA and Virgin in introducing fuel surcharges.
'We have guaranteed to our passengers that we will never put a fuel surcharge in place,' Dempsey told AFX News 
in an interview.
Ryanair this morning announced first quarter profits above analysts' expectations, with operating profits of 136.7 
mln eur, higher than the indicated range of 120-127 mln. Net profits came in at 115.7 mln eur, also higher than 
expected, while earnings per share rose 77 pct to 15 cents a share.
The inclusion in the first quarter of the Easter holiday break, which this year fell in April, contributed to the improved 
profitability.
The airline also benefited from the introduction of many more 'sun' destinations, increased business due to 
competitors' fuel surcharges, the initial impact of its baggage charging initiative and the earlier launch of new bases 
and routes.
However, Dempsey said the group is staying cautious about the outlook for the remainder of 2006-07 due to high 
fuel costs, which rose by 52 pct to 167.5 mln eur during the quarter, and the impact of its expansion plans.
Ryanair is now 90 pct hedged to the end of October at 70 usd a barrel and 90 pct hedged for November and 
December at 74 usd a barrel, but remains unhedged for the January to March 2007 quarter.
The carrier plans to increase its fleet by 27 aircraft and to announce two new bases over the coming months with 
launch dates in early 2007, as well as expanding existing bases. Dempsey said the airline is talking to a number of 
airports in regions where it does not currently have a strong presence, but declined to give further details.
'There's a considerable step-up in capacity coming and we're cautious about our performance during the winter, 
given the higher fuel prices,' he said.
INTERVIEW Ryanair rules out fuel surcharges
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said earlier that today's results reflected a much stronger yield environment, 
despite substantially higher oil prices.
O'Leary said, however, that he did not expect to maintain the buoyancy 'at similar levels during the second quarter 
or indeed the second half of the fiscal year.'
He said the group may sustain losses in the fourth quarter if oil prices rise above 74 usd a barrel, although the 
airline is maintaining its previous guidance of between 5-10 pct net profits growth for 2006-07.
Dempsey said: 'We would anticipate that the yield increase in the first quarter will track slightly up in the second 
quarter, but not significantly higher than 1-2 pct.'

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based low fares airline, today announced record first quarter 
profits, but warned that it may incur a loss in the final three months of 2006-07 if oil prices remain high.
The group, which in the first quarter to end-June carried 10.7 mln passngers, saw operating profits for the period 
rise to 136.7 mln eur from 79.9 mln, while net profits grew by 80 pct to 115.7 mln eur -- a new record. Total 
revenues in the period were up by 40 pct to 566.6 mln eur.
However, Ryanair's fuel bill during the quarter rose 52 pct to 167.5 mln eur and the group has extended its hedging 
period out to November and December at 74 usd barrel. It was previously hedged at 70 usd a barrel up until the 
end of October. After December, the group currently has no hedging facilities in place.
While the first quarter produced a record result, the airline warned that higher oil prices, and the likelihood of more 
difficult trading conditions during the Winter period, may mean it could incur a loss for the fourth quarter of 2006-07.
However, the group is still keeping its previous guidance for the year intact and it expects profits growth to be in the 
range of 5-10 pct for 2006-07. It said the bulk of this growth will be generated in the first and second quarters with a 
consequent reduction in profitability during the third and fourth quarters.

(Correcting name of company in first para)
LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holding PLC were firmer in late morning trade following better-than-expected 
first-quarter results leading to a mixed reaction from brokers, dealers said.
At 11.48 shares were up 1-1/2 pence at 447.
Ryanair this morning announced first-quarter profits above analysts' expectations, with operating profits of 136.7 
mln eur, higher than the indicated range of 120-127 mln. Net profits came in at 115.7 mln eur, also higher than 
expected, while earnings per share rose 77 pct to 15 cents a share.
In reaction Morgan Stanley maintained its 'overweight' stance on the shares with a fair value of 9.70 eur per share.
The US broker said in a note published to investors that revenues and net results were ahead of its expectations by 
8.4 pct and 15 pct, respectively.
It added that cost control has been effective once again, an area which the broker feels the market should focus on 
in the longer term.
Cazenove was more subdued on the stock sticking with an 'in-line' recommendation.
The broker noted the very strong set of results comfortably ahead of consensus. However, 'the sting in the tail is 
that full year guidance has been maintained', it added.
Furthermore in the brokers view the key issue for the share price therefore is whether the market buys into the 
group's caution about H2.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC welcomed the EU Commission's announcement yesterday of an enquiry 
into flights between Italy's mainland and Sardinia and what it perceives as the abuse of public service obligation 
(PSO) rules to block competition from low fare airlines and protect high fare Italian airlines.
On May 2, the Italian authorities blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from offering low fare flights on 16 routes between 
mainland Italy and Sardinia.
Speaking today, Ryanair head of communications Peter Sherrard said: 'Sardinian consumers and visitors are being 
ripped off, denied choice and paying fares 4 times higher than Ryanair's, solely as a result of the unlawful actions of 
the Italian authorities to block Ryanair's flights and permit the routes to be taken over by high fare Italian airlines.
'We hope the EU investigation will be completed quickly and Ryanair's low fares restored to the Sardinian routes.'

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC welcomed the EU Commission's announcement yesterday of an enquiry 
into flights between Italy's mainland and Sardinia and what it perceives as the abuse of public service obligation 
(PSO) rules to block competition from low fare airlines and protect high fare Italian airlines.
On May 2, the Italian authorities blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from offering low fare flights on 16 routes between 
mainland Italy and Sardinia.
Speaking today, Ryanair head of communications Peter Sherrard said: 'Sardinian consumers and visitors are being 
ripped off, denied choice and paying fares 4 times higher than Ryanair's, solely as a result of the unlawful actions of 
the Italian authorities to block Ryanair's flights and permit the routes to be taken over by high fare Italian airlines.
'We hope the EU investigation will be completed quickly and Ryanair's low fares restored to the Sardinian routes.'

MILAN (AFX) - EasyJet Plc said it welcomes the European Commission investigation, launched today, into flights 
between Italy's mainland and Sardinia, and sees it leading to more competition.
Previously, easyJet and Ryanair Holdings PLC have complained about Italian rules applying so-called public 
service obligations on these routes, which are usually designed for unprofitable routes.
'We are very satisfied and we are confident that the measure will bring back free competition on the routes to 
Sardinia,' said Arnaldo Munoz, easyJet's regional manager for for Southern Europe.
'To benefit will be Italian taxpayers, the passengers that can count on a choice on the routes, lower tariffs and a 
better service, and the Sardinian region, from increase in tourist flows,' he said.
The existing Italian rules impose a de facto monopoly on the 16 main routes between Sardinia and the Italian 
mainland, easyJet said.
Under public service rules, Italy's ENAC regulator chose a limited number of airlines on each route, setting 
conditions on flight frequency and tariffs.
Alitalia SpA was not chosen on the routes because it reportedly filed its application late with ENAC, though it has 
tried in court to reverse this.
Easyjet and Ryanair have been barred by ENAC from operating on Sardinian routes and are contesting this 
decision with the commission and courts.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Easyjet and Ryanair were higher in opening deals as Morgan Stanley lifted its target 
price in a review of the low cost carriers sector, dealers said.
Morgan Stanley expects the summer season to be strong for the low cost carriers, after recent traffic for June was 
strong, and with the yield environment looking particularly healthy.
The broker lifted Ryanair's target price to 9.70 eur from 9.10 eur, and expects Ryanair's net income to beat 
consensus estimates of 325 mln eur by 20 pct, with fuel hedged for the summer quarters to October helping to 
protect profitability.
Morgan Stanley also raised its estimates for Ryanair by 4 pct in the current year to reflect a stronger revenue 
environment and said the Irish group remains its preferred play.
The broker also lifted its target price for Easyjet to 450 pence from 360 pence, saying it expects more 'juice' to 
follow the group's strong performance with more upgrades possible, but noted the risk profile is higher into the Aug 
7 trading statement.
At 8.31 am, shares in Ryanair rose 0.11 eur to 7.94 were while Easyjet added 15-1/4 pence to 450-1/4.

SINGAPORE (XFN-ASIA) - Budget carrier Tiger Airways is considering setting up joint venture airlines in Asia and 
may launch the first one by the end of this year, chief executive Tony Davis said.
'It is our aspiration to be a pan-Asian brand,' Davis said at a news briefing, 'from being a Singapore-based airline to 
becoming an Asia airline.'
He added: 'We are well advanced in our negotiations and are in the process of executing it.'
There are discussions with airlines and other companies about new ventures, and the commercial terms are 
already being drafted by lawyers, he said.
Tiger Airways may consider an initial public offering (IPO) if it needs external funding to expand its network, Davis 
said.
'We're preparing to take the company public, though there are no plans for an IPO yet,' he said.
'What we are doing now is setting the groundwork so that, when there is a need for an IPO, we can raise the best 
possible price.'
Singapore Airlines owns 49 pct of Tiger Airways, government-linked investment company Temasek Holdings owns 
11 pct and the rest is split between Tony Ryan (the founder of European low-cost airline Ryanair) and US private 
investor Indigo Partners.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in the aviation sector have come under review by HSBC with both Lufthansa and Air 
France-KLM being upped to 'overweight' from 'neutral' and British Airways PLC and Easyjet PLC being increased to 
'neutral' from 'underweight', dealers said.
The broker said it continues to see Ryanair as 'overweight' moving its notional target price to 8.80 from 7.80.
Meanwhile, it said that strong revenue growth at both British Airways and Easyjet have led to the rating reviews.
However, HSBC was cautious on Iberia, downgrading to 'neutral' from 'overweight'
The broker noted that the upgrades come on the back of several key reasons including the fact that global airline 
margins have improved for four consecutive years, more than at any other time for 35 years.
It added that aircraft orders have hit a high. However, the broker said that evidence suggests that the upswing in 
airline profitability may not last much longer.
Furthermore, HSBC sees the the current strong revenue environment as creating a window of opportunity to push 
margins, and shares, higher.
At 8.08 shares went in reverse of the brokers comments with British Airways down 2 pence at 360-1/2, Easyjet was 
lighter by 6-1/4 pence at 422, Ryanair eased 0.01 to 7.69 pence, Lufthansa dipped 3-1/2 at 990 pence, Iberia sunk 
0.01 at 2 eur and Air France dropped 0.27 at 18.25 eur.

STOCKHOLM (AFX) - Low-cost carrier Ryanair said it is closing its operation at Stockholm's Vasteros airport, and 
will significantly reduce services from Malmoe and Gothenburg ahead of the introduction of a new Swedish flight tax 
on Aug 1.
The airline will continue flying to Stockholm Skavsta'a airport, but in total, 21 flights from Sweden to various 
European destinations are to be axed.
The flight tax, the product of an agreement between the Social Democratic government and its Green and Left 
Party allies, will tax each passenger 94 skr for flights within Europe, and 188 skr for those travelling further afield.
However certain airports in remote parts of Sweden are exempt from the tax, prompting the European Commission 
in Brussels to launch an inquiry to see whether it breaks competition rules.
The possibility of the tax has unnerved airlines for some time now, prompting several to reconsider their operations 
in Sweden.
Although initial indications from Brussels suggest the Commission is negative towards the tax, Ryanair, which has 
been at the forefront of campaigning against it, said it needs to act now for scheduling reasons.
'We cannot wait any longer. We've got to fix our winter timetables and can't wait to see what decision the EU 
commission comes up with regarding the Swedish flight tax increases,' said vice managing director Michael Cawley 
to Swedish news agency TT.
'We had intended to increase our activity in Sweden with 10-12 new services, but the decision to increase (the) 
flight tax upset all our plans,' he added.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in EasyJet were downgraded to 'neutral' from 'buy' at UBS given the recent 40 pct relative 
outperformance but the broker raised its price target to 480 pence from 460, dealers said.
In a note to clients, UBS said that although the cyclical revenue environment had continued to improve EasyJet's 
costs have not. UBS notes that management have increased cost guidance for the full year due to operational 
difficulties and wet leasing aircraft -- whereby the operator hires a plane with crew from another airline, but it is used 
in its own airlines network.
It noted that Ryanair had warned this winter would be difficult for yields which it expects to fall 5-10 pct due to new 
capacity, and said that EasyJet would not escape this dynamic. The broker said it was concerned that the market 
was focusing on this summer when it should have an eye on next winter.
It added that yield could change very quickly with a 1 pct move in yield translated to 10 pct on EPS.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has dismissed a newspaper report which said Europe's largest no-frills 
airline could face an EU investigation into alleged misstating of taxes and airport passenger fees on its European 
routes.
Today's Daily Telegraph said Ryanair has been accused of systematically inflating charges added to ticket prices 
for flights from airports including Dublin, Treviso, Charleroi, Rome, Pisa and Alghero. It said the practice may 
breach EU law.
It quoted Eva Lichtenberger, an Austrian MEP on the European parliament's transport committee as saying she is 
to call for an inquiry by the European Commission following claims of alleged mislabelling made by the German 
television programme PlusMinus.
However, Ryanair said the Telegraph's report was based on 'an inaccurate and untrue claim' made by PlusMinus.
It insisted no Ryanair passenger has ever been over-charged.
'Before any passenger is allowed to confirm and pay for a booking on Ryanair, they are presented with a 
breakdown of their total fare including taxes, fees and charges and are asked to confirm their agreement to this total 
amount before they are allowed to proceed with their booking,' it said.
'Every passenger agrees to these sums as part of the booking process.'

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair could face an EU probe into claims that it misstated taxes and airport passenger fees on 
its European routes, the Daily Telegraph reported.
The low-cost carrier has been accused of inflating charges added to ticket prices for flights from airports including 
Dublin, Treviso, Charleroi, Rome, Pisa and Alghero, a practice which the newspaper said may breach EU law.
Eva Lichtenberger, an Austrian MEP on the European parliament's transport committee, said she is to call for an 
inquiry by the European Commission following the allegations of mislabelling made by the German television 
programme PlusMinus.
At Dublin airport, Ryanair imposes a 'passenger service charge' of 15.40 eur. The Dublin authorities said its 
charges, such as runway, parking and airbridge fees, do not add up to 15.40.
'This is clear mislabelling. Ryanair is putting profit in its charges,' the Telegraph quoted an Irish official as saying.
Ryanair denied any misrepresentation of its charges, insisting all fees accurately reflected costs imposed at 
Europe's airports.
But it admitted some charges described as taxes were in reality service fees. 'Many charges at airports are referred 
to as taxes because their level has been set by governments even though they do not represent revenue which 
goes directly to the government,' the newspaper quoted the airline as saying.

LONDON (AFX) - The UK's aerospace industry's trade surplus with the rest of the world shrank by a third last year, 
largely due to the huge volume of Boeing aircraft being brought into the country by Irish no-frills airline Ryanair 
Hldgs, an industry report said.
Figures released by the Society of British Aerospace Companies show the industry's trade surplus declined from 
3.34 bln stg in 2004 to 2.25 bln stg last year, despite a surge in orders and exports, the Independent reported.
A spokesman for the society said this appeared to be mainly attributable to imports of Boeing aircraft, with Ryanair 
halfway through a 9 bln stg order with Boeing for 250 new 737 jets, the newspaper said.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' by ABN Amro with an 
increased target price of 8.10 eur, up from 6.80 previously, according to dealers.
In a note published this morning, the broker said its upgrade in stance reflects 7 pct upgrades to its full year 2007 
and 2008 net earnings forecasts for the Irish discount airline and an 8 pct upgrade to its 2009 forecast.
ABN Amro added that the upgrade also reflects its new assessment of the value of the airline's existing Boeing 737-
800 options, which it estimates at around 1 eur per share.
The broker said it believes the strong trading environment for low-cost carriers in Europe will offset fuel cost 
increases, and it forecasts Ryanair to report a 46 pct improvement in earnings for the June quarter on July 31.
ABN Amro said while its 2007 forecasts now sit above consensus, its raised 2009 forecast is below consensus.
The broker pointed out that it believes unionisation at Ryanair is inevitable and that the level of its third-party 
funding is not sustainable.
ABN Amro also noted that fuel prices, where Ryanair lacks both control and any competitive advantage over 
competitors, is forecast to represent 41 pct of the airline's costs in 2007.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has bought ten more Boeing 737-800s for 700 mln usd.
The ten aircraft will enter the Ryanair fleet in March (3), April (4) and June (3) of 2008 and will increase the total 
number of firm orders made by Ryanair for Boeing 737-800 aircraft to 249.
Ryanair's chief financial officer and deputy chief executive, Howard Millar, said: 'These 10 new aircraft will allow 
Ryanair to launch even more low fare routes to new destinations in 2008.
'Ryanair's no fuel surcharge guarantee is widening the gap between our low fares and the high prices of our fuel 
surcharging competitors. This is driving demand and attracting millions of additional passengers to Ryanair.'

SEATTLE (AFX) - Boeing Co. said Monday that European low-cost carrier Ryanair has exercised options to order 
10 more of its next-generation 737-800 jets.
The order is valued at $705 million at list prices, though carriers often can negotiate discounts. Deliveries will begin 
in 2008. The planes will be outfitted with winglets, which reduce drag to boost fuel efficiency by 3 to 5 percent.
Airlines recently have been ordering more jets, hoping to retire the older, gas-guzzling portions of their fleet amid 
high fuel prices. Boeing has been battling with European rival Airbus to fill the market.
Ryanair is the world's second-largest operator of the 737 jet, after Southwest Airlines Co.
Boeing shares fell 62 cents to $81.29 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

LONDON (AFX) - Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, who is famously tough 
on his competitors, has admitted to a few of his own shortcomings in an interview with The Times today.
O'Leary, who has said that he plans to retire in 2008, told The Times that Ryanair would need someone 'more 
professional' than him when it became Europe's biggest carrier.
'When we're the biggest airline in Europe, it will be inappropriate to have somebody here shouting, swearing, 
abusing the competition,' he said.
'You need more professional management than me. And that time is coming,' O'Leary is reported as saying.
Asked whether an Irishman might succeed him at the helm of Ireland's phenomenally successful company, he said, 
perhaps with tongue firmly in cheek: 'Much more likely a ghastly, emollient Englishman, probably with a knighthood: 
Sir Roger Mucknsmuck.'
O'Leary is famed for his outspoken comments and raucous abuse of passengers who delay his aircraft or complain 
about flight service standards.
Earlier this month, Ryanair, Europes biggest low-cost operator, said that it was on track to double passenger 
volumes and profit by 2012.

LONDON (AFX) - Air France-KLM has resorted to legal action to prevent Ryanair Holdings PLC establishing its first 
French hub in the southern city of Marseilles, a move seen as a serious threat to France's national carrier, 
according to The Daily Telegraph.
The newspaper did not name its source, but said Air France has filed a case at France's top civil court, the Conseil 
d'Etat, alleging that Marseilles airport is breaching the law by offering discount airlines cut-price fees at its second, 
no-frills terminal.
Ryanair plans to build a far-reaching network at the new hub in Marseilles, serving three cities in Morocco to cater 
to the large North African community in Provence.
Eleven new routes will be in operation from November, with a target of 1.2 mln passengers within two years.
Two crews and a brace of 733-800s will be based at the hub, which will link Norway, Germany and Britain to 
Provence.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet PLC were lower mid-morning in reaction to the weaker tone of the market and 
after Exane BNP Paribas cut its stance on the budget airline to 'neutral' from 'outperform' and recommended 
investors switch into rival Ryanair Holdings PLC, dealers said.
At 10.05 am, shares in easyJet were 13 pence lower at 352-1/2 while the broader indices were also lower.
In a note to clients, Exane said easyJet would need to break into the lucrative business traveller market for a further 
positive re-rating in the shares to be justified.
It said that a year on from the announcement of a deal with BTI the agreement has yet to get off the ground.
Exane recommended a switch into Ryanair, whose shares are currently
trading at a significant discount to easyJet which is unjustified because of the sustainable difference in operating 
margins.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has filed another complaint to the European Commission over Air 
France-KLM's latest attempt to block competition from low-fare airlines in France.
Last month, Ryanair said it would base two new aircraft at Marseille Airport, which will serve 13 routes and deliver 
almost 1 million
additional passengers a year to the airport.
According to Ryanair, Air France has filed a law suit against Marseille Airport in an attempt to block the airline's use 
of a new low-cost terminal.
Ranair said the tariff for using the airport has been published and it has been agreed by the French Civil Aviation 
Authority.
Last month, Ryanair filed a complaint to the European Commission over about 1 bln eur of state aid that Air France 
has received from the French Government in the form of subsidised domestic landing and passenger fees.

    PRESS COMMENT

 THE LEX COLUMN comments on BAA/FERROVIAL (what seems clear is that the new BAA will be a very different 
animal from the old one), RYANAIR (shareholders hoping for a juicy special dividend have good reason to 
expect that Ryanair's success will soon flow over to them), US banks (with profitability at near record 
levels and the sector trading at almost 14 times this year's earnings, it hardly takes much of a dark 
cloud to justify caution), IBM/India (the world's largest computer services company may be moving in the 
opposite direction of portfolio flows, but it is bang in line with foreign direct investment trends), 
European Central Bank (continued strong growth in money and credit will be the hawks' main concern; but, 
while this is a strong argument in favour of further rate increases, it does not on its own warrant more 
aggressive tightening) 
    Express
 SHARE WHISPER: LEISURE & GAMING (keep an eye on new finance director Josh Joshi; he is experienced in

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC edged a touch higher in opening deals after the no-frills airline 
posted a 12 pct increase in full year adjusted net profit despite a 74 pct rise in fuel costs, dealers said.
But gains were capped as the Dublin-based carrier cautioned investors to expect more modest profit growth of 5-10 
pct in the current year.
In response, UBS reiterated its 'buy' advice and said full year pretax of 334 mln eur compared with its flagged 330 
mln and a consensus of 332 mln.
Referring to the outlook, the broker added management suggests profit growth of 5-10 pct this year, in line with 
consensus, but lower than UBS' expected 16 pct.
In a note to clients, UBS said there was some good news on fuel costs and a pay deal for pilots.
The broker said fuel costs have been a concern given the company's unhedged position, and while 90 pct hedging 
to October at 70 usd per barrel is not an especially favourable level, it does provide some certainty.
Meanwhile, pilots at 14 of the 15 bases have agreed on pay at what the broker sees 'as reasonable levels', albeit 
the Dublin pilots are the one group not to agree yet.
At 8.37 am, shares in Ryanair were 0.12 eur at 6.90.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading European exchanges opened sharply lower this morning tracking Wall Street where 
hawkish comments from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke stunned investors and dashed hopes that the Fed's battle 
with inflation is over, dealers said.
At 08.58, the STOXX 50 was down 32.04 points at 3,322.33 and the STOXX 600 was down 3.42 points at 315.52.
The DJIA closed 199.15 points lower at 11,048.72, while the Nasdaq dropped 49.79 points to 2,169.62 as jitters 
over high oil prices exacerbated signals that the Federal Reserve will keep lifting interest rates to contain price 
increases.
Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke told an international monetary conference in Washington that while rising energy 
costs have helped slow the pace of economic growth, core inflation -- excluding energy and food -- was near the 
central bank's tolerance level and could warrant further rate tightening.
Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei 225 began its afternoon session 167.39 points lower at 15,500.92, while the Hang 
Seng was 146.48 points lower at 15,869.75 at midday.
Oil prices fell in Asian trade on hopes Iran's row with the West over its controversial nuclear program could be 
resolved after EU officials arrived in Tehran for talks, traders noted.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for July delivery was down 13 cents at 72.47 usd a barrel from its close 
of 72.60 usd in the US overnight.
Ryanair Holdings PLC bucked the trend moving up 1.78 pct as Europe's largest no-frills airline reported a better-
than-expected 12 pct increase in full year adjusted net profit despite a 74 pct rise in fuel costs.
And UK airport operator BAA soared 2.16 pct as the world's largest airports operator today confirmed it has agreed 
to be taken over by a consortium led by Spanish infrastructure group Grupo Ferrovial SA -- down 1.89 pct -- for 
950.25 pence a share, or just under 10.3 bln stg.
BNP Exane Paribas downgraded the shares to 'neutral' from 'outperform', though.
Bayer was one of only a handful of European large caps to post gains -- up 0.26 pct -- as the German group said 
Phase III trials of its kidney cancer drug Nexavar were 'encouraging'.
Euroshares open lower as Bernanke comments spark heavy Wall St losses
And Roche was outperforming --down only 0.73 pct -- as it said new results from its HERA study show that cancer 
drug Herceptin decreases mortality risk amongst women in early stages of breast cancer by 34 pct.
And Shares in ABN Amro Holdings NV were only 0.7 pct lower as they have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' 
by UBS on valuation grounds.
Nokia led the fallers on the STOXX 50 -- down 2.64 pct -- after techs took a battering in the US overnight.
But Xstrata dropped 4.71 pct after Inco announced last night that it has begun talks with an unnamed third party 
with a view to countering Teck Cominco's hostile offer for Falconbridge.
Teck Cominco offered 17.8 bln cad for Inco last month, provided it dropped plans to acquire rival Falconbridge.
Last week, Xstrata reiterated its belief that its 52.50 cad all cash offer for Canada's Falconbridge remains superior 
to the friendly bid made by rival Inco.
And other miners were down as amid hopes of an end to the Iran crisis, with gold, silver and copper all posting 
heavy losses overnight. Anglo-American fell 3.77 pct. BHP Billiton fell 3.18 pct.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Stocks are trading higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's surprisingly 
hawkish comments sparked losses in the last session.
In the opening minutes, the Dow Jones industrials were up 2.09 points at 11,050.81, the Nasdaq Composite gained 
4.66 points to 2,174.28, and the S&P 500 futures edged up .64 of a point to 1,265.93.
U.S. markets plummeted Monday, with the Dow industrials losing 199 points after Bernanke said at a Washington, 
D.C., conference that recent core inflation readings are at or above the upper end of a range that's consistent with 
price stability.
The comments were read by Fed watchers to mean that the central bank will make its seventeenth consecutive 
interest rate rise at the end of the month; markets were previously pricing in only a 50-50 shot that the Fed would lift 
its key rate to 5.25 percent from 5 percent at the June meeting.
Bernanke's comments also unsettled European and Asian stock markets on Tuesday. Two more Federal Reserve 
speakers, Susan Bies and Thomas Hoenig, also will talk on Tuesday.
Still, not all Fed watchers said Bernanke's comments guarantee a move to 5.25 percent. The Wall Street Journal's 
top Fed reporter, Greg Ip, wrote for Tuesday's editions that if inflation data reported next week are tame, or there 
are signs of a more pronounced slowing in the economy, the Fed could decide to leave rates alone.
Markets in the last session also were pressured by renewed oil price gains, though on Tuesday crude oil futures 
edged 3 cents higher at $72.63 a barrel.
The dollar also was stable against the euro and the yen.
Of companies in focus, U.K. airports operator BAA accepted a $19-billion offer from a consortium led by Spain's 
Grupo Ferrovial, though a group led by Goldman Sachs bid slightly more.
A Citigroup executive told an analyst conference that it sees significant opportunities for growth in the Europe, 
Middle East and Africa region. Bill Mills, CEO of the EMEA region, said opportunities will include major growth in 
Russian equity markets. Mills added he expects the privatization of public banks in the Middle East and North Africa 
to provide expansion opportunities. Citigroup also intends to grow its corporate and investment banking business in 
Germany, where the firm has previously focused on retail banking.
Stocks are up after losses last session
Irish airline Ryanair reported a 12 percent rise in adjusted profit, coming in slightly ahead of forecast.
IBM Corp. will triple its investment in India by three times to $6 billion over the next three years.
Google Inc. is planning to release a Web-based spreadsheet application allowing users to collaborate online in 
what's seen as another challenge to Microsoft's Office applications.
Novartis agreed to pay as much as $507.5 million to get the rights to Human Genome Sciences' hepatitis C drug.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading European shares remained sharply lower in midday trade after hawkish comments 
yesterday from US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke stunned investors and suggested more interest rate increases may 
be on the way, dealers said.
At 12.26 pm, the STOXX 50 was down 32.04 points at 3,322.33 and the STOXX 600 was down 3.42 points at 
315.52.
Spread bettors, IG Index, said the Dow looks set to open 20 points higher, only recouping some of the 199 points 
lost yesterday.
Severn Trent jumped into pole position in the UK after the utility group posted full-year results that were slightly 
better than consensus and gave further details regarding the disposal of Biffa. Shares added 2.59 pct.
Enel SpA was 1.26 pct higher in late morning trades, outperforming a weak market, after announcing late yesterday 
it bought 67.5 pct of Romanian electricity distributor Electrica Muntenia Sud for 820 mln eur.
Brokers generally welcomed the deal as making strategic sense for Enel, but noted that the price agreed was above 
the European average.
Other utilities were higher, benefiting from their defensive qualities. RWE was up 1.27 pct and Union Fenosa added 
0.23 pct.
Ryanair Holdings PLC rose 0.74 pct, as Europe's largest no-frills airline reported a better-than-expected 12 pct 
increase in full year adjusted net profit, despite a 74 pct rise in fuel costs.
And UK airport operator BAA soared 1.99 pct as the world's largest airports operator today confirmed it has agreed 
to be taken over by a consortium led by Spanish infrastructure group Grupo Ferrovial SA -- down 1.89 pct -- for 
950.25 pence a share, or just under 10.3 bln stg.
BNP Exane Paribas downgraded the shares to 'neutral' from 'outperform', though.
Bayer moved up 0.47 pct as the German group said Phase III trials of its kidney cancer drug Nexavar were 
'encouraging'.
Euroshares lower midday as Bernanke comments spark US rate hike fears
And Roche was outperforming -- trading flat -- as it said new results from its HERA study show that cancer drug 
Herceptin decreases mortality risk amongst women suffering from early stages of breast cancer by 34 pct.
Elan was 9.41 pct lower after the FDA approved its Tysabri Multiple Sclerosis treatment but with restrictions. 
Serono was up 1.34 pct.
Societe Generale led the fallers on the STOXX 50 -- down 3.92 pct. A Chinese press report quoted a Guangdong 
Development Bank official as saying SocGen and Citibank are equally matched as they compete for a stake in the 
bank.
Nokia and other tech stocks lost ground after heavy losses by their peers in the US and Asia. Nokia fell 2.52 pct. 
ASML fell 1.37 pct and Infineon was 3.13 pct lower.
Xstrata dropped 3.26 pct after Inco announced last night that it has begun talks with an unnamed third party with a 
view to countering Teck Cominco's hostile offer for Falconbridge.
Teck Cominco offered 17.8 bln cad for Inco last month, provided it dropped plans to acquire rival Falconbridge.
Last week, Xstrata reiterated its belief that its 52.50 cad all cash offer for Canada's Falconbridge remains superior 
to the friendly bid made by rival Inco.
Other miners were down amid hopes of an end to the Iran crisis and as Bernake's comments raise prospect of 
further rate hikes, with gold, silver and copper all posting heavy losses overnight. Anglo-American fell 3.44 pct. BHP 
Billiton fell 3.99 pct.
Vedanta, widely expected to be added to the FTSE 100 based on tonight's closing prices -- fell 6.45 pct on profit-
taking.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading European exchanges are seen opening sharply lower this morning tracking Wall Street 
where hawkish comments from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke stunned investors and dashed hopes that the Fed's 
battle with inflation is over, dealers said.
The DJIA closed 199.15 points lower at 11,048.72, while the Nasdaq dropped 49.79 points to 2,169.62 as jitters 
over high oil prices exacerbated signals that the Federal Reserve will keep lifting interest rates to contain price 
increases.
Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke told an international monetary conference in Washington that while rising energy 
costs have helped slow the pace of economic growth, core inflation -- excluding energy and food -- was near the 
central bank's tolerance level and could warrant further rate tightening.
Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei 225 began its afternoon session 167.39 points lower at 15,500.92, while the Hang 
Seng was 146.48 points lower at 15,869.75 at midday.
Oil prices fell in Asian trade on hopes Iran's row with the West over its controversial nuclear program could be 
resolved after EU officials arrived in Tehran for talks, traders noted.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for July delivery was down 13 cents at 72.47 usd a barrel from its close 
of 72.60 usd in the US overnight.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has reported a better-than-expected 12 pct increase in full 
year adjusted net profit despite a 74 pct rise in fuel costs.
But the Dublin-based carrier cautioned investors to expect more modest profit growth of 5-10 pct in the current year.
Norske Skog has appointed Christian Rynning-Toennesen as its new CEO.
Mining shares look set to slide following sharp falls by metal prices overnight amid hopes of an end to the Iran 
crisis, with gold, silver and copper all dropping.
Xstrata however, could come under added pressure after Inco announced last night that it has begun talks with an 
unnamed third party with a view to countering Teck Cominco's hostile offer.
Euroshares outlook - seen lower as Bernanke comments spark heavy Wall St losses
Teck Cominco offered 17.8 bln cad for Inco last month, provided it dropped plans to acquire rival Falconbridge.
Last week, Xstrata reiterated its belief that its 52.50 cad all cash offer for Canada's Falconbridge remains superior 
to the friendly bid made by rival Inco.
In other M&A news, Deutsche Boerse still wants to merge with Euronext after the France-based exchange operator 
decided to combine with NYSE Group Inc., Handelsblatt said, citing Chairman Reto Francioni.
British airports operator BAA PLC has approved a 10 bln stg takeover bid from Spanish construction group Grupo 
Ferrovial, according to the BBC.
Aegis shareholders are being urged to oppose an effort by French
billionaire Vincent Bollore to acquire two seats on the advertising company's
board of directors.
And ThyssenKrupp unit Thyssenkrupp Budd Co, a supplier to the automotive industry, said it sold its aluminium 
castings operations in the US for an undisclosed sum.
The sale of ThyssenKrupp Stahl Co, which employs employs 813 people, is part of a restructuring plan announced 
by ThyssenKrupp AG, its parent company, earlier this year.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has reported a better-than-expected 12

Excluding fuel, unit costs fell by 6 pct. Including fuel they rose 5 pct. Fuel costs rose 74 pct to 462 mln eur.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has reported a better-than-expected 12 
pct increase in full-year adjusted net profit but cautioned investors to expect more modest growth of 5-10 pct in the 
current year.
For the year to March 31 2006, the Dublin-based carrier made a record adjusted after tax profit of 302 mln eur. This 
compares to 268 mln eur last time and guidance of 295 mln eur issued by the company in February.
The profit performance was driven by a 26 pct increase in passenger traffic to 35 mln passengers and a 1 pct rise in 
yields or average fares. Total revenue increased 28 pct to 1.69 bln eur.
Excluding fuel, unit costs fell by 6 pct. Including fuel they rose 5 pct. Fuel costs rose 74 pct to 462 mln eur. 
Ryanair's after tax margin was 18 pct.
Basic earnings per share rose 11 pct to 35.28 cents.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading European exchanges remained weaker at midday, with gains among oil majors offset by 
volatile trade an ongoing worries on the health of the world's largest economy, and with several markets in Europe 
closed for the Pentecost holiday, dealers said.
At 11.50 am, the Stoxx 50 was 9.72 points lower at 3,365.47, while the Stoxx 6000 ran back 1.09 points to 319.87.
Looking ahead to Wall Street, spread bettors IG Index expect the DJIA to open broadly flat at 11,215 on persistent 
concerns about the state of the US economy after weaker-than-expected job data last Friday.
Back in Europe, oil heavyweights benefited as crude prices climbed to 73.7 usd per barrel after warnings from Iran 
against halting its controversial nuclear program.
Shares in Total climbed 0.6 eur to 51.3, with Eni adding 0.25 eur to 23.59 while Repsol YPF was 0.13 eur firmer at 
22.
Meanwhile, M&A news provided focus with little other expected on the corporate front.
Suez remained one of the main European casualties, down 0.57 eur at 29.1 after Enel renewed efforts to get the 
EU to thwart the merger between Gaz de France and Suez on competition grounds, the daily Le Figaro said.
Investors also eyed shares in Euronext NV, 0.21 eur higher at 71.35, benefiting from news of a potential tie-up with 
NYSE.
According to the Saturday Telegraph, Deutsche Boerse AG has appointed Hawkpoint in its attempt to break up 
Euronext's agreed merger with the NYSE, while reports in the Sunday Times suggested the German stock 
exchange is considering raising its offer for Euronext in an effort to scupper the agreed tie-up.
Shares in Deutsche Boerse sank by 1 eur to 104.3.
BAA and Grupo Ferrovial SA will also be in focus as today is the last chance for the Spanish group to improve its 
offer of 900 pence after BAA rejected it saying the stock is worth at least 940 pence per share.
Euroshares lower midday; volatile trade offset gains in oil majors, NY seen flat
According to an article in the Sunday Telegraph, the UK airport operator has been sounding shareholders about the 
possibility of a break-up of the group in an attempt to highlight the hidden value in the group.
Meanwhile, the Telegraph and the Sunday Times also reported that a consortium led by Goldman Sachs is 
preparing to launch a 10 bln stg counterbid for BAA in response to an expected increased offer from Ferrovial.
BAA was 9 pence firmer at 912 pence, while Ferrovial was flat at 61.5.
Finally, air carriers may see some activity, with British Airways and Ryanair reporting traffic figures and after IATA 
said the global airline sector could post full year losses of 3 bln usd, hit by higher fuel costs.
Ryanair will report its full year results tomorrow.
BA was 7-3/4 pence to the worse at 340, while Ryanair was 0.11 eur lower at 6.755.

ROUNDUP BAA says worth over 10 bln stg as OFT move threatens Ferrovial bid
ROUNDUP BAA says worth over 10 bln stg as OFT move threatens Ferrovial 
bid

LONDON (AFX) - BAA PLC, the owner of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports that is battling an 8.75 bln stg, 
810 pence a share, hostile bid from a consortium led by Spanish infrastructure group Grupo Ferrovial SA, today 
maintained its value is 'clearly higher' than 10.16 bln stg, or 940 pence a share, and promised shareholders much 
bigger dividends in addition to a 750 mln stg capital return.
But its second defence document was overshadowed by news the UK's competition watchdog, the Office of Fair 
Trading, is considering investigating the UK airports market -- a move that sent BAA's shares over 5 pct lower in a 
rising overall market, as investors took the view that the chances of the Spanish group raising its bid are fast 
diminishing.
An OFT inquiry could lead to a referral to the Competition Commission.
'In the context of the current bid offer for BAA and the European Commission's clearance yesterday of the proposed 
takeover, it would be inappropriate for the OFT to consider this issue further at this time without making public that 
the structure of the [UK airports] market may be reviewed,' the OFT said.
It noted BAA currently owns and operates airports which handle 63 pct of air passengers beginning or ending their 
journeys in the UK, with 86 pct of passenger journeys in Scotland undertaken through Scottish airports operated by 
the group.
Significantly, the OFT plans to make a detailed announcement by the end of June on the scope of any review -- well 
after the June 5 deadline for Ferrovial to raise its bid, and probably after the offer is scheduled to lapse on June 19.
The OFT regards the timing of its announcement, coming the same day as BAA's defence, as coincidental.
Andrew Fitchie, transport analyst at Collins Stewart, described the OFT's move as 'the ultimate poison pill'.
'It's crystallised massive regulatory uncertainty, leaving BAA shareholders vulnerable,' he said.
He reckons Ferrovial's offer is now likely to collapse, sending BAA's share price down to its regulatory asset base 
value of 750 pence.
ROUNDUP BAA says worth over 10 bln stg as OFT move threatens Ferrovial bid
Damian Brewer, analyst at JP Morgan, reckons the OFT's stance combined with BAA's strengthened defence 
increases the chances of the bid failing. He sees a downside risk in the share price to 'at least 747 pence'.
'We believe the OFT move increases the chance of bid lapse because it raises uncertainty of what the consortium 
may be buying,' he told clients.
A spokeswoman for Ferrovial declined to comment.
Mike Clasper, BAA's chief executive, admitted to being totally bemused by the OFT's announcement.
He insisted the first he heard about the OFT statement was a phone call from advisers at 7.10 am this morning and 
stressed his genuine shock.
'I wish this hadn't happened this morning because I wanted to talk about the great value of this company,' he said.
'Coming totally out of the blue on the day that we're going out with our day 39 document, if you don't think that 
would shock you, you need to see a psychiatrist.'
The CEO stressed the UK airports market is already heavily regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the 
Competition Commission and previous assessments have concluded that the structure of the market does not 
operate against the public interest.
'We stand behind the document that we released today and we don't feel it (the OFT move) changes any of the 
fundamental perspectives in that document or our confidence in that business,' he said.
Clasper wouldn't comment on whether he thought the UK government may have had a hand in the OFT's move, so 
as to prevent a foreign buyer taking control of strategically important airports. 'I have no idea and you should ask 
them,' he said.
Airlines welcomed the OFT's statement.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has long called for a break-up of BAA.
'When the BAA monopoly offers a sweetener of 750 mln stg to its shareholders to reject Ferrovial's bid, it clearly 
proves that this monopoly has been overcharging passengers and feathering its own nest,' said chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
Andrew Barker, easyJet PLC's planning director, said he looked forward 'to providing overwhelming evidence that 
BAA is not acting in anything like the interests of the travelling public'.
BAA's defence document set out proposals for a 40 pct dividend per share hike in 2006/07, to 31.5 pence, and a 7 
pct increase in 2007/08 to 33.7 pence.
The group also reiterated plans for a 750 mln stg capital return to shareholders through a tender offer, to be made 
as soon as practicable after the Ferrovial consortium's or any other offer lapses. It said the proposals demonstrate 
'its confidence for the future prospects of the business'.
BAA, which owns seven UK airports and two overseas, Naples and Budapest, said its 940 pence plus valuation 
was partly derived from comparing its London assets with the UK's regulated water, electricity and gas utilities.
Its circular to shareholders highlights 'four main building blocks' underpinning the value of the group.
It highlighted its London airports as being in a period of very strong growth, creating demand for investment which 
the CAA has a statutory duty to incentivise.
It stressed its non-London airports generate higher returns than the London airports, with the size of this side of its 
business nearly tripling with last year's acquisition of Budapest Airport.
ROUNDUP BAA says worth over 10 bln stg as OFT move threatens Ferrovial bid
BAA also talks about 'opportunities that lie ahead', both in the UK and overseas, for its 'first-rate' management team 
to continue creating additional value.
Finally, it argues any bidder should expect to have to pay a premium to secure control.
Ferrovial made its 810 pence a share bid on April 7. It was immediately rejected by BAA as 'not beginning to reflect' 
the true value of its assets.
'Over the last 15 weeks the Ferrovial consortium has failed to offer BAA shareholders anything which approaches 
the true value of their company,' said chairman Marcus Agius.
'We remain determined that this company will not be sold to the Ferrovial consortium or any other bidder on the 
cheap.'
The Spanish group's consortium also comprises Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec and an investment 
company directed by Singapore's GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd.
BAA has also rejected a 'highly conditional' 870 pence a share approach from a consortium led by US investment 
bank Goldman Sachs.
'We've had no more substantial approaches from anybody,' said Clasper.
By 2.40 pm shares in BAA were down 44 pence at 790, valuing the business at 8.88 bln stg. Ferrovial shares were 
up 0.4 eur at 59-1/4.

    MARKET COMMENT
    The broad market is expected to open lower, extending yesterday's heavy declines after fresh falls on 
Wall Street and in Asia overnight, as continued inflation and rate hike concerns weigh on sentiment.
    'We'll probably open lower... Sentiment is pretty down at the moment on continued US inflationary 
concerns... We could see a bit of a bounce in selected blue chips over the morning, but the broad trend 
will be negative,' a leading international investment bank dealer said.
    On specific stocks, Repsol YPF could benefit from an upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell' by Citigroup on 
valuation, and with a 21 eur per share target.
    Elsewhere, Ferrovial will be in the limelight ahead of today's deadline for the Spanish constructor to 
decide on whether it will maintain its current 810 pence per share bid for BAA, improve it or walk away 
from the deal. If it chooses not to increase its offer today, Ferrovial still has until June 5 to do so 
under UK regulations. BAA is believed to be looking for at least 900 eur per share to start negotiating.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- U.S.-listed shares of European companies stumbled on Wednesday pressured by 
concerns about higher interest rates.
Shares of Vivendi couldn't hang on to an earlier price spike following news of a break-up bid and a higher 2006 
earnings outlook from the French media and telecommunications conglomerate.
'Even Vivendi had some good news out ... it was up about 2% when we first got in this morning, and it just turned 
around and came right back down,' said Jim Federlin, a trader at Jefferies & Co.
Shares of Vivendi last traded at $35.49, down 0.7%.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR Index was down, at last check, by 2.3% to 148.47 and the Bank of New York 
Composite ADR Index lost 2.6% at 149.59.
'There's selling across the board and the [U.S.] dollar is all over the place,' said Federlin.
Stocks in New York crumbled after an increase in both the Consumer Price Index and the core rate came in slightly 
higher than expected. The numbers reduced the chance that the Federal Reserve will pause in raising interest rates 
at its meeting in June.
Fears about higher interest rates also damaged European shares. The German DAX Xetra 30 index lost 3.4% at 
5,653, the French CAC-40 index gave up 3.2% at 4,920 and the U.K. FTSE 100 index fell 2.9% to 5,675.
The FTSE was off this morning after minutes from the Bank of England's interest-rate-setting meeting showed that 
one member had pushed for a rate increase.
Ryanair Holdings Plc was among the handful of stocks to gain ground on the Europe ADR Index. The shares were 
up 0.9% at $50.05 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the low cost carrier to overweight from equal-weight.
Morgan Stanley said it believes investors are overestimating the impact on rising fuel prices on the company in the 
long term.
Skilsoft Plc picked up 0.9% to $5.39.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- U.S.-listed shares of European companies stumbled on Wednesday pressured by 
concerns about higher interest rates.
Shares of Vivendi couldn't hang on to an earlier price spike following news of a break-up bid and a higher 2006 
earnings outlook from the French media and telecommunications conglomerate.
'Even Vivendi had some good news out ... it was up about 2% when we first got in this morning, and it just turned 
around and came right back down,' said Jim Federlin, a trader at Jefferies & Co.
Shares of Vivendi last traded at $35.49, down 0.7%.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR Index was down, at last check, by 2.3% to 148.47 and the Bank of New York 
Composite ADR Index lost 2.6% at 149.59.
'There's selling across the board and the [U.S.] dollar is all over the place,' said Federlin.
Stocks in New York crumbled after an increase in both the Consumer Price Index and the core rate came in slightly 
higher than expected. The numbers reduced the chance that the Federal Reserve will pause in raising interest rates 
at its meeting in June.
Fears about higher interest rates also damaged European shares. The German DAX Xetra 30 index lost 3.4% at 
5,653, the French CAC-40 index gave up 3.2% at 4,920 and the U.K. FTSE 100 index fell 2.9% to 5,675.
The FTSE was off this morning after minutes from the Bank of England's interest-rate-setting meeting showed that 
one member had pushed for a rate increase.
Ryanair Holdings Plc was among the handful of stocks to gain ground on the Europe ADR Index. The shares were 
up 0.9% at $50.05 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the low cost carrier to overweight from equal-weight.
Morgan Stanley said it believes investors are overestimating the impact on rising fuel prices on the company in the 
long term.
Skilsoft Plc picked up 0.9% to $5.39.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC were upgraded to 'overweight' from 'equal-weight' 
at Morgan Stanley with a price target of 9.10 eur, dealers said.
In a note to clients, the broker said it believes any weakness surrounding the June 6 results and potential guidance 
statements for the summer could be used as an opportunity to invest in the shares.
It added it sees such guidance statements as the key to near-term performance, and the company is likely to 
remain cautious, although the broker believe there is room for upside to yields and unit cost guidance during the 
summer.
Furthermore, in the long term investors are overestimating the impact of the fuel cost risk, which has been offset by 
strong unit cost reductions across the rest of the business, the broker added.

PARIS (AFX) - Low cost airline Ryanair has been fined 250,000 eur by the Paris commercial court for producing 
'misleading' advertising that was disparaging to Air France-KLM, a judicial source said.
In its complaint the Franco-Dutch airline particularly highlighted as misleading the slogan 'Ryanair.com, 391 pct 
cheaper than Air France-KLM' which appeared on the Irish company's website.
The group also criticised Ryanair advertising leaflets that claimed the company 'made the sky the cheapest place 
on earth', a slogan it said was based on the Air France-KLM claim it 'made sky the most beautiful place on earth'.
In its judgement, returned on May 12, the Paris commercial court said the price comparison was 'not objective' and 
the slogan 'misleading'.
It ordered Ryainair to pay Air France-KLM 250,000 eur in damages.

discount carrier's annual passenger total reaches 40-50 mln.
'There is going to come a point, when we have 40-50 mln passengers, that the company will need a chief who is 
different than I am,' O'Leary told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
'As the biggest carrier in Europe, they would have no use for someone who runs around in jeans and calls 
politicians idiots and says that the EU Commission is made up of Communists.'
At present Ryanair carriers about 25 mln passengers per year.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said it will appeal to the European courts the decision of Italy's regional 
administrative court of Lazio to stop Ryanair and Easyjet's flights on routes between mainland Italy and Sardinia.
Ryanair said the Italian authorities blocked Ryanair's flights between Rome and Alghero by imposing a Public 
Service Obligation on the route despite the
fact that 2 airlines (Ryanair and Airone) were already operating year round
flights between Rome and Alghero.
'The PSO system in Europe is clearly out of control. It is being abused
by national governments to protect high fare flag carriers while at the
same time blocking low fare competition,' Ryanair said in a statement.

MILAN (AFX) - The Lazio administrative court has confirmed its suspension of the Enac civil aviation regulator's 
decision not to award rights to Alitalia SpA to fly to Cagliari, Sardinia, said Ansa news agency.
A provisional ruling by the court earlier this month allowed Alitalia to continue its flights, and today's decision 
extends the ruling until the court hears the full case, Ansa said, without citing a source.
In the same ruling, the court has taken no decision on Ryanair and easyJet's appeal against Enac's decision, which 
stops the two low-cost airlines flying routes to Sardinia, it said.
Enac in its recent decision on Sardinia awarded flying rights to Italy's AirOne and Meridiana airlines from May 2, 
2006 to May 1, 2009.
The decision requires the two airlines to meet public service obligations to provide certain frequencies, timetable 
and fares.
Easyjet and Ryanair argue that the rules are not appropriate for Sardinia given there are sufficient airlines ready to 
fly to the island under normal competitive terms and at cheap prices.
Ansa said no date was given for when the court will hear the full case.
Alitalia rejects reports that it filed its application too late, saying it had made clear to Enac it wanted to continue 
flying the routes.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Ryanair might feel the impact from continually rising oil prices on business and the airline 
could see a dip in its margin levels should oil prices remain at record levels, Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary told the Handelsblatt.
The profit margin could drop 'slightly under the 20 pct mark,' O'Leary said.
'But even when oil prices climb to above 100 usd a barrel, we will remain profitable -- presumably as the only (such) 
airline worldwide,' he continued.

FOCUS Iberia poorly hedged against oil prices amid lower long-haul offering

LONDON (AFX) - Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana's full-year earnings could be hit as it is less hedged against oil 
prices than its European peers, and is less able to pass on fuel costs to passengers as it gas fewer long-haul seat 
kilometres, analysts warned.
Hedging policy has now become critical for airlines -- with Ryanair in particular paying the price for having no 
hedging at all -- given the market's focus on the potential for a squeeze in margins and sales with Brent crude 
above 70 usd per barrel.
Iberia, with only 52 pct of its available seat kilometers in long-haul, is less able to pass on the cost of fuel to its 
customers than its European flag carriers competitors, which have a higher proportion of the juicier markets such as 
transatlantic and Asian routes, where there is more pricing power.
Long-haul capacity is 76 pct for Air France-KLM, 78 pct for British Airways PLC and 71 pct for Deutsche Lufthansa 
AG.
Yet Iberia is much less hedged against fuel price rises than those flag carriers, according to Fortis equity analyst 
Jaime Semelas -- a sentiment also shared by ABN Amro, which is cautious on airlines because of the risk of margin 
and revenue squeezes.
However, Iberia's share price has only fallen 3 pct since April 1, while other airlines have seen share price falls of 7 
to 15 pct in the last month, according to Thomson ONE analytics. Ryanair's share price has fallen 12.5 pct over this 
period, SAS has fallen 12 pct, and Easyjet and British Airways have fallen about 7 pct.
'Iberia's share price reflects speculation about a possible merger with British Airways, but if you subtract that, then it 
looks expensive,' said Fortis' Semelas.
Iberia has hedged 80 pct of its total first quarter requirement -- 50 pct at 50-60 usd per barrel and 30 pct at 54 usd -- 
and 50 pct at 50-60 usd in the second to fourth quarters, he said.
In contrast, Air France-KLM hedged 84 pct of its 2005-06 needs at 42 usd, 62 pct of its 2006-07 needs at 47 usd 
and 34 pct of its 2007-08 needs at 50 usd, said Semelas.
FOCUS Iberia poorly hedged against oil prices amid lower long-haul offering
British Airways hedged 80 pct of its needs until March 2006 at 48 usd per barrel and 65 pct of its needs from April-
June 2006 at 55 usd. In the third quarter, 55 pct is hedged at 57 usd. In the fourth, 57 pct is hedged at 57 usd, 42 
pct is hedged at 60 usd in the first quarter of 2007 and 24 pct is hedged at 63 usd from April-Dec 2007.
Lufthansa hedges every month, which means 90 pct of its total fuel requirement for 2006 is already hedged, 
followed by 60-70 pct for 2007 and 40 pct for 2008, said Fortis' Semelas.
'As a consequence of this lower level of hedging, the consensus forecast for (full-year) EBIT should fall -- it is 
currently 114 mln eur -- but if oil prices stay above 70 usd, then Iberia should post EBIT below 30 mln eur,' said 
Semelas.
His current EBIT estimate is 90 mln eur, and he is now forecasting Iberia's share price will fall below 2 eur. It is 
currently trading at 2.22.
'On an enterprise value to EBITDA basis, Iberia is trading at a 46 pct premium to the flag carriers,' said Semelas.
Other analysts, though, suggest support for Iberia may be based on optimism about its two-year business plan, the 
Director Plan, announced in Oct 2005.
'It had previously been a somewhat unloved and underperforming stock,' said one analyst.
Iberia's share price has fallen 22 pct over the last two years, and has underperformed the IBEX 35 by 10 pct over 
the last two months.
'The story has been about the deliverability of the new plan, which aims to cut operational expenses and expand 
long-haul capacity,' said ABN Amro analyst Andrew Lobbenberg.
'There were concerns about whether Iberia could overcome labour relations obstacles, but Iberia has cut a deal 
with the ground crew, and is now in negotiation with the air crew,' he said.
Given that profits have declined over the last two years, investors are waiting for an inflection point, a sign that the 
business model is being turned around, said Lobbenberg.
But there are good reasons to be sceptical about Iberia's current strategy, said Fortis' Semelas.
Iberia's long-haul capacity expansion will be focused on the Europe to Latin America routes -- where it wants to 
increase capacity by 17 pct 2006-2008.
'The problem for Iberia is that Air France-KLM also has aggressive expansion plans to increase capacity by 20 pct, 
which means a stiffer competitive environment,' said Semelas.
'Load factors are going to fall on these routes in the early years of Iberia's capacity expansion, because passenger 
traffic will be growing at a slower rate,' he said.
According to Airbus' global market forecast for passenger traffic from 2005-2020, routes from Central America to 
South America will grow 6.3 pct, Europe-South America will grow at 5.8 pct, and Europe-North America 4.6 pct.
'Iberia, though, thinks passengers will match capacity later on,' said Semelas, who expects more planes to be 
added to the one acquired for the Latin America route in the first quarter in the next two years.
Increased competition could also imperil Iberia's low-cost ambitions.
On April 25, it announced the launch of a new low-cost carrier with four local partners.
'Iberia wants to replicate Lufthansa's 'German Wings' airline, but my fear is that it will cannibalise Iberia's routes,' 
said Semelas.
FOCUS Iberia poorly hedged against oil prices amid lower long-haul offering
'On the other hand it makes sense to fight the low-cost competition Iberia is facing in Barcelona with the same 
weapons,' he said.
'But British Airways' experience with Go scares me,' Semelas added.
There is also the threat of new competition from the increased airport capacity in Madrid -- with Easyjet reportedly 
negotiating to build an operational hub there.
Iberia is one of the healthiest companies in Europe, financially, with a net cash position on its balance sheet, but its 
operating results have taken a turn for the worse in the fourth quarter of 2005, with sales revenues falling 5.2 pct 
year on year, and operating income falling 81.3 pct year-on-year.
Iberia's load factor was improving -- with the 12-month moving average improving to 77.2 in March 2006, from 72.3 
in Dec 2002.
But the annual rate of change in Iberia's load factor, which had been improving at 5.2 pct per year, has fallen in the 
first quarter, and the load factor is now deteriorating at 1 pct per year, according to calculations by Thomson 
Investment Management News, a joint venture partner of AFX News.
Following the announcement of the Director Plan, analysts' sentiment towards Iberia improved, after the slide in 
sentiment during 2005, with only a net 33.3 pct of analysts recommending selling or holding the shares, after 
bottoming out at 56.5 pct, according to First Call data. But in March this number worsened again, with a net 41.7 pct 
of analysts bearish.
'Iberia has been improving efficiency of business in terms of passenger traffic, but not fast enough,' said Dresdner 
Kleinwort Wasserstein equity analyst Mike Powell.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- US Airways Group stock hit a high in Thursday morning trading while the Amex Airline 
Index ticked higher as SkyWest Inc. and Continental Airlines rose more than 1%.
US Airways Group gained 2.2% to $48.93 after trading as high as $49.20 at one point. The company, which 
operates US Airways flights and America West flights, late Wednesday reported 6.8% lower traffic in April and a 
12% cutback in capacity but load factor, a measurement of how full planes are flying, increased to 82%, up 4.9 
percentage points from last year.
Calyon Securities analyst Ray Neidl, in a research note, called the company's passenger revenue per available 
seat mile increase of 25% 'stellar' and wrote that he expects the stock's climb is supported by those revenue gains.
The Amex Airline Index rose 0.5% to 50.78 points. Meanwhile, crude oil prices tracked lower near $72 a barrel.
Continental stock added 1.4% to $28.48 while SkyWest rose 1.3% to $23.94.
Other gainers included Alaska Air Group , which hit a five-year high of $39.80, and AirTran Holdings .
Outside the airline index, UAL Corp. rose almost 2% after reporting that United Airlines' traffic and capacity rose 
during the month of April yet load factor was still a record for the month at 82.8%, a 2.7 percentage point increase. 
Traffic increased by 8.4% over last year and capacity rose 4.9%.
Among U.S.-listed foreign airlines, Ryanair Holdings rose 2.3% to $49.80.

INTERVIEW easyJet says BA 's low-cost ambitions 'a deception' to customers
INTERVIEW easyJet says BA's low-cost ambitions 'a deception' to 
customers

LONDON (AFX) - easyJet PLC today brushed aside British Airways PLC's recent attempt to enter the domain of the 
low-cost carrier and described its move to slash short-haul ticket prices as 'a deception' to fool customers.
Last month, BA cut its short-haul fares to a number of European destinations with the price of some one-way tickets 
down by as much as 50 pct.
The move was seen as an attempt by BA to take on the no-frills carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair Holdings 
PLC, although BA customers will still have to pay a fuel surcharge.
Today, easyJet's new chief executive Andy Harrison said he was 'not concerned' by BA's attempt to muscle in on 
the low-cost sector and said the only way to deliver consistently low fares was to have a low cost base.
'While we take the threat of competition seriously, BA's decision to cut its fares on some European routes is a 
deception to its customers,' he told AFX News in a telephone interview this morning. 'I don't see how BA can be a 
low-cost operator with such a high cost base... it just doesn't work,' he added.
He pointed to a fall in average fares at easyJet over the past five years and said prices could go even lower over 
the next few months, despite the increased cost of aviation fuel. 'We still see average fares edging down... that is 
the essence of our business to offer customers the best possible deal,' he continued.
Today, easyJet revealed that it carried 14.9 mln passenger in the six months to March 2006 -- a 10.1 pct increase 
on the same period last year.
However, higher fuel costs -- up by 55 mln stg in the half -- coupled with the normal seasonality of the business, 
which this time did not include Easter, saw first half pretax losses widen from 22 mln to 40 mln stg. However, this 
was better than the 45 mln stg loss the market was anticipating and in the stock market the group's shares climbed 
11 pence to 324 at 9.40 am.
Furthermore, given a more stable outlook for fuel prices -- the group is almost 50 pct hedged against its 
requirement for the second half of 2005-06 -- and a good performance over Easter, the board today raised its 
earnings guidance for the full year. The group now expects full year pretax profits to grow by 10-15 percent, 
compared to its previous guidance of 'mid-to-high single digit' growth. This implies a rise in the full year outturn to 
around 90-95 mln stg, compared to last year's reported figure of 82.6 mln stg.
INTERVIEW easyJet says BA 's low-cost ambitions 'a deception' to customers
Stockbrokers Panmure Gordon this morning upgraded its investment recommendation to 'buy' from 'hold' and 
raised its price target to 375 from 350 pence a share.
'Cost reductions are now coming in ahead of expectations and this should allow for a 5 pct reduction in seat costs. 
While oil prices remain a concern, the board's increased full year guidance shows the resilience of the business and 
the ability of the group to offset massive fuel increases,' the house said in an investment note.
Harrison said the group's underlying performance remained strong with cost reduction and revenue improvements 
helping to offset the rising cost of fuel.
'We expect our ancillary revenues to grow by around 20 pct this year, while our continued cost management 
programme should see a reduction of about 5 pct per seat, excluding fuel,' he added.
easyJet, which currently operates 235 routes, saw first half revenues rise by 13.8 pct to 629.5 mln stg, helped by a 
new marketing and promotional campaign and increased use of the company's on-line booking facility. 'We're now 
getting 20 mln hits a month and the overall use of the website has increased by 50 pct over the past six months,' 
said Harrison.
On current trading, Harrison admitted that the group faced a 'big summer' given BA's move on pricing and the 
World Cup soccer tournament in Germany, which kicks-off in June. 'The World Cup is a risk... we see it as 
something to be managed rather than an opportunity,' he added.
Harrison is also hopeful that a pay deal with its pilots could be agreed soon. easyJet has offered pilots a 6 pct 
increase and the results of the ballot should be known soon. 'Its a pretty good offer,' said Harrison.

COPENHAGEN (AFX) - Ryanair has been fined 70,000 dkr by the Danish police for misleading advertising 
involving competitor SAS AB, newswire Ritzau's Bureau reported.
According to the newswire report, Ryanair's advertising said: 'SAS claims they have the lowest air prices in Europe 
get at least a 98 pct saving compared with SAS's so-called 'lowest prices'.'
The newswire said consumer affairs ombudsman Hagen Joergensen regarded this claim as misleading, causing 
him to report Ryanair to the police as the advertising did not meet the legal requirements for loyal price 
comparisons.
At the same time, the advertising brought discredit on a competitor by not giving information about the important 
differences between the flights compared in the advertisement, Joergensen added.
The comparison involved prices for destinations where SAS had no direct flights, so that passengers would have to 
fly from Malmoe in Sweden to Stockholm in order to fly to London, whereas Ryanair had a direct route from Malmoe 
to London.
The companies' pricing was also different, as Ryanair used single tickets, while SAS based its pricing on return 
tickets, the report said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- U.S.-listed stocks of European companies were modestly lower Monday with the 
broader market pulled down on mixed earnings reports and investor concerns about the impact of a weakened U.S. 
dollar following comments by the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR Index lost 0.17% at 151.62 and the Bank of New York Composite Index rose 
fell 0.41% to 153.74.
The dollar slumped to a three-month low against the Japanese yen and seven-month low against the euro early 
Monday, after the world's leading industrial nations urged China to allow greater flexibility in the value of its 
currency.
'The main cause in this drop was the G7's communiqu? that shifted to a firmer policy tone against China's 
regulation of currency exchange,' said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital Markets. 'With 
both European and American policy makers now unified in seeking a readjustment in exchange rates of Asian 
currencies, the strength in the yen is likely to continue.'
Trading in Europe was also lower on currency movement. But Deutsche Telekom was a standout in its home 
market and in New York, after private-equity firm Blackstone agreed to make an investment.
The German DAX Xetra 30 index lost 0.3% at 6,079, the French CAC-40 index fell 0.6% at 5,221 and the U.K.'s 
FTSE 100 eased 0.6% at 6,098.
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index lost 0.6% at 339.30.
Many dollar-sensitive exporters including DaimlerChrysler AG were lower. The German automaker fell 1.3% to 
$56.29.
Among the index's biggest percentage decliners were Ryanair Holdings Plc , which was, at last check, down 2.4% 
at $47.63 and healthcare company EDAP TMS, which gave up 6.5% at $15.10.
But shares of Deutsche Telekom , Europe's largest phone company, rose 4.7% at $17.63 after German state 
development bank KfW said it will sell a 4.5% stake in the company to U.S. private-equity firm Blackstone.
Wall Street - European ADRs Index weighed down by U.S. dollar worries
KfW agreed to sell the stake for 2.68 billion euros ($3.31 billion), or 14 euros a share, a 2.6% premium to Deutsche 
Telekom's closing price in Frankfurt on Friday.
The share-price gain helped lift the Bank of New York European Telecom ADR Index by 0.23% to 65.10.
BT Group Plc also helped that index by gaining 2.6% at $39.03. The U.K. telecom company said it has delayed the 
release of a major study into its pension-fund deficit, but confirmed that the British government will guarantee an 
estimated 75% of its multi-billion-pound deficit fund liabilities.
In other company news, Novartis said sales of drugs to treat hypertension boosted its first-quarter profit by 32% to 
$1.96 billion and revenue by 13% to $8.3 billion. Analysts polled by AFX News were expecting earnings between 
$1.51 billion and $1.81 billion on sales between $8.21 billion and $8.77 billion.
Novartis shares picked up a penny to trade at $57.25

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Air Berlin has launched the roadshow for its initial public offering in which it aims to raise 
around 350 mln eur in gross proceeds.
An indicative price range would be set on April 27, with the so-called bookbuilding period to run from April 28 to May 
4, at the end of which the final issue price would be decided, chairman Joachim Hunold told a news conference 
here.
The funds raised on May 5 would then be used to fund the budget carrier's expansion in eastern Europe where it 
faces cut-throat competition from rivals such as easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC, the company said in its 
flotation prospectus.
The IPO will place more than 50 pct of Air Berlin's capital in free float.
Around half of the money raised is earmarked to fund the purchase of 55 new Airbus jets scheduled to be delivered 
by the end of 2011, and around 10 pct of the funds would be used to repay existing debt.
In the longer term, Air Berlin hoped to see its shares listed on the MDAX mid-cap index of the Frankfurt stock 
exchange.
Hunold said the airline was forecasting a 20 pct increase in revenues this year compared with 1.22 bln eur in 2005.
He gave no profit forecast. But in 2005, Air Berlin booked a net loss of 116 mln eur.
Air Berlin employs a workforce of 2,650 and has a fleet of 56 aircraft.

LONDON (AFX) - British Airways PLC will today throw down the gauntlet to low cost airlines easyJet PLC and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC by slashing prices from Heathrow and Gatwick to almost all its European short haul 
destinations, The Guardian reported citing airline insiders.
The newspaper said BA will cut fares to places such as Berlin, Paris and Barcelona by up to 50 pct.
The price cuts are part of an overhaul of the airline's fare structure, rather than a one-off promotion, according to 
the article.
Unlike the low-cost carriers, BA will carry on offering its traditional extras, including free food and drink on all flights. 
There will also be no extra charges for hold baggage.
Last month, Ryanair imposed a 5.00 stg per bag fee on all passengers wanting to check in luggage, following 
Exeter-based Flybe, which started charging 4.50 stg bag in February.
BA believes the combination of much lower fares with the convenience and flight transfers offered by Heathrow and 
Gatwick, and prime destination airports will win large numbers of passengers from the no-frills carriers.
Airline insiders said yesterday that BA had been experimenting with the new lower fares on a handful of its short 
haul routes in recent months. They have prompted a significant pick-up in the number of passengers carried. On 
some routes the load factor has improved by up to nine percentage points, though BA's target for the new strategy 
is understood to be substantially lower than that, according to the article.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- Resource stocks helped boost U.S.-listed shares of European companies Monday as 
crude-oil and precious-metal prices reached new highs on supply concerns, stemming in part from geopolitical 
tension over Iran.
Markets across Europe were closed Monday in observance of Easter.
At last check, the Bank of New York Europe ADR Index rose 1.03% to 147.55 and the Composite Index was up 
0.98% to 149.72.
Shares of oil and gas producers were all higher with crude futures reaching $70 a barrel. Iran said over the 
weekend that it plans to continue enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which it claims is for generating power 
for civilian use.
The move by Iran is against the demands by Western governments and the U.N. Security Council.
Oil giant BP Plc , the top volume mover in the sector, rose 1% to $72.94, while Total SA moved up 1.3% to $135.53 
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc added on 1.1% at $66.42.
The geopolitical concerns also moved gold futures to a fresh 25-year high and resulted in a rally across the metals 
sector.
Mining stocks were among the day's best price performers, with Randgold Resources up 4.3% to $22.10, BHP 
Billiton Ltd. up 3.2% to $44.55 and Rio Tinto Plc adding 2.9% to $223.20.
Dutch biotech company Crucell NV jumped 4.4% to $26.80 to top percentage gainers.
Among the companies losing ground were Belgian supermarket operator Delhaize , which slipped 20 cents to 
$70.62, and Ryanair Holdings Plc , which lost 1.2% to $51.95.

LONDON (AFX) - No bombs were found on board a Ryanair jet that was diverted to a Scottish airport while en route 
from Paris to Dublin, police said.
The Boeing 737 jet, with 167 passengers on board, including 71 children, made an unscheduled stop at Prestwick 
airport, 35 miles south of Glasgow yesterday after a note was passed to cabin crew.
Flight FR025 was reportedly escorted into Prestwick by two Royal Air Force Tornado fighter jets, touching down 
safely at 2:20 pm.
Strathclyde police said all passengers were questioned and a search of the aircraft found no suspicious objects. It 
eventually landed at Dublin International Airport at 11:30 pm yesterday.
Assistant Chief Constable John Neilson revealed late Wednesday that the bomb alert was handed to the captain in 
the form of a note in a magazine about halfway through the flight from Beauvais Tille airport, north of Paris.
Ryanair spokeswoman Pauline McAlester said yesterday that none of the passengers had been detained in 
Scotland as a suspect.
During the alert, scheduled incoming flights to Prestwick were diverted to Edinburgh, and outbound passengers led 
back to the terminal building.

Ryanair chief urges Poland to liberalise airport sector

WARSAW (AFX) - The head of Irish budget carrier Ryanair PLC Tuesday urged the Polish government to 
deregulate the airports sector as he unveiled plans to double the number of passengers flying to and from Poland in 
five years.
'Ryanair alone could double the total air travel to and from Poland in the next five years if there's more competition, 
more deregulation, more liberalisation,' the company's chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
At a press conference marking Ryanair's first year of operation in Poland, O'Leary said that his firm operated 23 
routes from eight Polish airports, sustaining 1,600 employees. The airline expected to carry 1.6 million passengers 
to and from Poland this year.
'We believe in the next five years we could extend our operation to 16 airports and 80 routes. We could be carrying 
10 million passengers a year to and from Poland. That's more than the total air travel to and from Poland last year.'
However, to enable such expansion, O'Leary said the government needed 'break up the centralised control of 
airports where the central government and central airports' authority prevent regional airports from developing new 
business with airlines like Ryanair.'
'All we're asking the government to do is to ... stop screwing around at the airports and just deregulate the bloody 
things,' said the Ryanair chief, known for his blunt speaking.

'Ryanair alone could double the total air travel to and from Poland in the next five years if there's more competition, 
more deregulation, more liberalisation,' the company's chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
At a press conference marking Ryanair's first year of operation in Poland, O'Leary said that his firm operated 23 
routes from eight Polish airports, sustaining 1,600 employees. The airline expected to carry 1.6 million passengers 
to and from Poland this year.
'We believe in the next five years we could extend our operation to 16 airports and 80 routes. We could be carrying 
10 million passengers a year to and from Poland. That's more than the total air travel to and from Poland last year.'
However, to enable such expansion, O'Leary said the government needed 'break up the centralised control of 
airports where the central government and central airports' authority prevent regional airports from developing new 
business with airlines like Ryanair.'
'All we're asking the government to do is to ... stop screwing around at the airports and just deregulate the bloody 
things,' said the Ryanair chief, known for his blunt speaking.

LONDON (AFX) - Air Berlin has accelerated its plans to go public to take advantage of current strong demand for 
share offerings, the Financial Times reported, citing its sister paper FT Deutschland.
Germany's second-largest air carrier now plans to list in Frankfurt in May, the newspaper said.
The group wants to place 50 pct of its capital on the market, raising 600-900 mln eur, with more than half of the 
revenue to be reinvested in the group and the rest to be given to shareholders, it said.
Analysts will begin to sound out selected investors this week and the roadshow could begin as early as two weeks 
from now, the FT said.
Air Berlin yesterday refused to comment on the report.
In March chief executive Joachim Hunold said that the IPO would take place before the end of the year - with the 
exact date dependent on market developments.
Morgan Stanley and Commerzbank are managing the listing and using Ryanair and easyJet as a benchmark to 
work out the price of Air Berlin shares, the report said.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Deutsche Lufthansa AG have been upgraded to 'hold' from 'sell' at ABN Amro on 
valuation grounds in a sector review, dealers said.
The Dutch broker has a 15 eur price target, above current levels but says the outlook remains opaque, hence the 
'hold' rating.
It said the target price factors in 1.5 bln eur for the value of Thomas Cook, bmi and Fraport stakes but the shares 
could rise above that level if a sale of Thomas cook began to appear likely, if there was any progress in labour 
restructuring at Skychefs or surprisingly strong traffic data.
But it said geopolitical unrest, further expansion in Germany by Ryanair, or industrial relations problems all limit 
upside.
At 12.41, Lufthansa shares were up 0.03 eur to 14.73 eur.

STOCKHOLM (AFX) - Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson is suing low-cost airline Ryanair for allegedly using 
his image in its advertisements without authorisation, said the lawyer representing Persson in the case, Lennart 
Kanter.
'He cannot accept (...) that his name or his image be used for commercial purposes' without his authorisation, said 
Kanter, adding that the prime minister had chosen to pursue the case after Ryanair refused to pay 8,000 eur in 
compensation.
A writ was lodged with the Stockholm court of first instance jointly with the former foreign minister Laila Freivalds, 
whose image was also reproduced in an advertising insert published in the Swedish press at the end of February, 
said Kanter.
In a sly reference to the crisis of confidence which shook the Swedish government in the wake of the Asian tsunami 
of 2004, Ryanair presented a photograph of Persson and Freivalds in the advertisement under the caption 'Time to 
flee the country?'.
Freivalds resigned last month after months of criticism over her handling of the Mohammed cartoons furore.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are tipped to open higher, clawing back some of yesterday's losses, as a solid 
performance on Wall Street offset ex-dividend factors, with all eyes on BP's trading update, dealers said.
According to CMC markets, the FTSE 100 will start the day 12 points higher at around 6,017 having closed 
yesterday 19.6 easier at 6,004.7.
Meanwhile, US stocks ended higher as optimism over the upcoming first-quarter earnings season helped propel the 
Nasdaq to its best level since February 2006.
The DJIA rose 58.91 points to 11,203.85, the Nasdaq was up 8.62 to 2,345.36, and the S&P 500 added 8.12 to 
1,305.93.
The upbeat mood spilled over to Asia, with the Nikkei 225 ending the morning up 99.12 at 17,392.03, while the 
Hang Seng was closed.
Still in Asia, oil prices declined further as expectations of strong US inventory data later today offset ongoing supply 
concerns.
Earlier this morning, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in May, was down 0.10 usd at 66.13 
usd a barrel, having flirted with highs of 68 usd earlier in the week.
Back in London, on a relatively quiet day for blue chip news a trading update from BP is likely to take centre stage.
The oil major's production is expected to have stabilised following last year's slump brought about by storm-related 
disruptions at its production and refining business.
Analysts believe BP will reveal that quarterly output has reached around 4.1 mln barrels of oil equivalent per day, 
unchanged from the year-ago figures but ahead of the 4.02 mln boepd it reported in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Still in blue chips, full-year results from Signet will also garner interest with investor attention likely to be focused on 
the outlook for the US retail market in 2006/07.
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is looking for the Anglo-American jeweller's pretax profits on continuing operations 
to come in a 199 mln stg.
London shares outlook - higher on the back of Wall St gains; BP in focus
Signet's last announcement detailed strong fourth-quarter US sales but continued weakness in the UK.
British Airways will also be in focus with the national carrier releasing March traffic figures.
Deutsche Bank is forecasting premium traffic up 6 pct, traffic up 3.3 pct, capacity 2.6 pct higher and a 50 basis 
points rise in load factor to 76.2 pct.
The broker believes the majority of the growth will come from Asia/Pacific and Africa/Middle East as it sees limited 
capacity growth in Europe/Americas.
And no-frills peer Ryanair will also update investors on March traffic figures with Deutsche Bank predicting a 23 pct 
hike in passenger numbers to 3.16 mln with the load factor flat at 80 pct.
Elsewhere, Manganese Bronze and Victrex are scheduled to release interim numbers with AgCert International, 
Henry Boot and Cyprotex all posting final results.
In M&A, ITV could come under early pressure after Roger Parry, the chairman of regional newspaper group 
Johnston Press denied he is mulling a bid for the broadcaster.
Parry was responding to recent press reports, which had suggested he was teaming up with Merrill Lynch and 
private equity houses to make a bid for ITV.
And the takeover battle for The London Stock Exchange will also rumble on after The Daily Telegraph reported the 
bourse operator is to conduct an internal strategic review of its consolidation options.
This will include a merger with Euronext and a tie-up with one of the US exchanges, among them the New York 
Stock Exchange.
The paper said the review will be marked, late next month, by the handing back of 510 mln stg to shareholders.
Ex-dividend factors will also come into play, with the FTSE 100 estimated to lose almost 3 points with Alliance & 
Leicester, Hanson, Pearson, Kingfisher and PartyGaming all trading without payout rights.
In economic news, investors will have several indicators to digest ahead of tomorrow's Bank of England rate 
decision.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's services PMI is seen dipping to 58.4 in March from the 22-
month high of 58.9 the previously.
In contrast, February industrial production is expected to rise 0.3 pct month-on-month, but drop 0.9 pct year-on-
year.
And finally, manufacturing production, which makes up about 80 pct of overall industrial output, is expected to show 
a 0.2 pct month-on-month rise and a 1.0 pct year-on-year fall.

OSLO (AFX) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has been fined 500,000 Norwegian kroner (76,000 usd, 
63,000 eur) by the Norwegian consumer protection agency for unfair treatment of passengers, NTB news agency 
reported today.
The agency said the airline had failed to improve customer care on three points on which Ryanair had previously 
been warned, NTB said.
In February the agency, backed by consumer groups in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, petitioned Norway's 
commercial court, the Markedsraadet, over Ryanair's policy of charging high handling fees when refunding unused 
tickets or transferring tickets between passengers.
The carrier was also criticized for being unclear towards travellers about liability rights if planes are delayed or 
baggage is destroyed, lost or damaged.
The court had given the airline until mid-March to change its policy.
'Because Ryanair has not taken the steps set out by the Markedsraadet, the Consumer Ombudsman has imposed 
a 500,000 kroner fine,' Bjoern Erik Thon spokesman for the consumer group said.
'If Ryanair fails to pay the fine, we will take the case to court,' Thon added.

OSLO (AFX) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has been fined 500,000 Norwegian kroner (76,000 usd, 
63,000 eur) by the Norwegian consumer protection agency for unfair treatment of passengers, NTB news agency 
reported today.
The agency said the airline had failed to improve customer care on three points on which Ryanair had previously 
been warned, NTB said.
In February the agency, backed by consumer groups in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, petitioned Norway's 
commercial court, the Markedsraadet, over Ryanair's policy of charging high handling fees when refunding unused 
tickets or transferring tickets between passengers.

LONDON (AFX) - Landing charges at Stansted Airport are expected to triple under proposals put forward last week 
by BAA PLC, the UK's largest airports operator, angering the airlines using the airport, according to The Sunday 
Telegraph.
The move was seen by some as a defensive gesture by BAA as the group gears up to defend itself against a 9 bln 
stg hostile bid expected within the next two weeks from Grupo Ferrovial SA, the Spanish infrastructure group.
BAA, which also owns Gatwick and Heathrow airports, said it needed the extra income to pay for a 4 bln stg new 
runway proposed for the Essex airport on which work is due to start in about 2012.
However, the proposal to ramp up charges has caused outrage among the airlines using Stansted, according to the 
newspaper.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, the largest operator at the airport, this weekend said it would consider legal action if the plan 
was accepted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the airports regulator.
'BAA's plans are massively, blatantly gold-plated. There is just no reason to build the type of facilities they are 
planning,' Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, is reported as saying.
He claimed the plans were based on flawed predictions of passenger growth that had never been verified by 
independent forecasts,' according to the newspaper. He pointed out that BAA is incentivised to spend as much 
money as possible rather than invest efficiently.
'BAA gets a 7.75 pct regulated return on money it can spend so it makes sense for them to pull the wool over the 
CAA's eyes and spend as much as possible because that is how they make their money,' Callaghan is quoted as 
saying.

COPENHAGEN (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is negotiating with Copenhagen Airports AS to start flying from the 
airport group's Kastrup airport in Copenhagen, newswire Ritzau's Bureau reported, citing Karl Hoegstadius, who 
heads Ryanair's Nordic operations.
The newswire said the background for the talks is a new environment tax that Sweden will levy on air travel from 
July 1, the same day that a Danish passenger tax is withdrawn.
Ryanair currently flies to Aarhus and Esbjerg airports in Denmark, which are three-four hours travel by train from 
Copenhagen, and Malmoe airport in Sweden, which is about an hour from the Danish capital.
According to the newswire, Ryanair has already decided to transfer one flight from Malmoe to Copenhagen from 
July 1.
The new Swedish environment tax could also have consequences for other Ryanair routes to Sweden, Hoegstadius 
said.

INTERVIEW Easyjet to evenly open routes in new, existing markets

MILAN (AFX) - EasyJet PLC chief executive officer Andrew Harrison said that the group expects to evenly open 
routes in new and existing markets in the near-term.
Harrison, who took over from Ray Webster on Jan 1, said the airline will open on average 40 new routes a year and 
that they will be divided '50:50' between existing and new markets.
He added that the group does not intend to carry out acquisitions to grow as continental Europe offers sufficient 
opportunities for organic growth.
'The boundaries of Europe are expanding East and South. There is no shortage of opportunity,' he added.
Earlier this month, the airline announced flights to Marrakech in Morocco, Istanbul in Turkey and Rijeka, Croatia's 
third largest city.
'Acquisitions are not at all on our priority list,' he added, noting that the company already has 111 aircraft in service 
and purchase rights for another 120.
By 2008, the airline will already have boosted its fleet to 150, which represents 'a substantial increase' in its 
transport capacity, he said.
Harrison ruled out that the airline could diverge from its current business model of servicing European destinations 
to cover intercontinental routes.
'The essence of easyJet is simplicity. We do one thing and do it on a huge scale,' he said.
'It's much better to do one thing well than two or three averagely. Particularly in this business which is very 
competitive.'
He added that the airline has no plans to introduce in-flight gambling.
Last year, Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said it is planning to trial in-flight gambling by 
spring 2007.
Regarding possible consolidation in the airline industry, Harrison said that there are advantages to being a large-
size carrier and that 'some of the smaller operators may decide to merge.'
INTERVIEW Easyjet to evenly open routes in new, existing markets
However, he cautioned that merging two companies 'is never straightforward.'
'It is easy to announce an acquisition but it is difficult to implement,' he said.
Harrison added that he does not see 'any business linkage' with the Icelandic FL Group and there are no integration 
talks with the company, which has a 16.5 pct stake in easyJet.
'We just treat them with the same respect as we do with any other major shareholder.'
In an earlier press conference to during the opening of a base at Milan's Malpensa airport, Harrison said the group 
is aiming at 35 mln passengers in 2006, of which 3.5 mln will stem from its Italian routes.
He also declined to unveil any new routes saying that such announcements are only made when the group is ready 
to operate them to avoid giving forward signals to competitors.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is to reduce its services to Cork Airport following recent cost increases 
there.
The airline said the Cork Airport Authority has recently announced a range of increases for various services at the 
airport which will push up its costs there by over 30,000 eur per annum.
Europe's largest no-frills airline blamed the rises on the debt Cork has inherited from the construction of its new 'Taj 
Mahal-like terminal'.
The Liverpool-to-Cork route will reduce from 7 per week to 4 per week, although Ryanair will also start a three-times 
weekly service from Liverpool to Kerry.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are expected to open modestly higher, despite falls on Wall Street last night, with 
BT in focus amid bid speculation and results from Rank and JD Wetherspoon providing the highlights among 
corporate earnings, dealers said.
According to spread-betting firm IG Index, the FTSE 100 index is seen opening four points higher at 5,837 after 
closing down 11.1 points at 5,833 yesterday.
US stocks closed lower after a rise in long-term interest rates, an increase in crude-oil prices and a mixed sales 
performance from retailers in February sparked concern about the economy's outlook.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 28.02 points at 11,025.51 with the Nasdaq Composite finishing the 
day 3.53 points lower at 2,311.11, while the S&P 500 Index dropped 2.1 points to 1,289.14.
Across Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 index closed down 246.42 points at 15,663.34, while the Hang Seng began 
its afternoon session 11.55 points higher at 15,894.
Oil prices continued higher in Asian trading hours as the market focused on concerns about developments in Iran 
and Nigeria rather than on the healthy stocks reported in the US.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in April, was up 0.20 usd at 63.56 usd from its close of 
63.36 usd in the US overnight.
Back in London, a report in The Times suggests BT is being examined as a potential bid target by a number of 
global private equity firms in a move that could value the telecoms group at a minimum of 20 bln stg.
In domestic corporate news, leisure group Rank is scheduled to issue full-year results. Dresdner Kleinwort 
Wasserstein anticipates a pretax profit of 105.8 mln stg, down from 111.9 mln stg the year before.
The company has been the subject of bid speculation, with William Hill and Hilton seen as potential suitors.
Pubs group JD Wetherspoon is set to report first-half numbers. Altium Securities forecasts pretax profit of 24.5 mln 
stg, up from 22.3 mln the year before.
Investors will hope to hear management's views on the anticipated impact of the Scottish smoking ban, which is 
due to take effect on March 26, with the blanket smoking ban in England arriving in summer 2007.
London shares outlook - modestly higher with bid talk surrounding BT
Elsewhere, British Airways and Ryanair are both due to publish traffic figures for February.
On the economic front, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's measure for service sector performance 
is seen remaining steady at 57.0 for the second month running in February.
A reading above 50 marks expansion.
But many analysts doubt that service-sector growth in the first quarter will match the levels seen in the last three 
months of 2005. Additionally, a significant number of analysts predict that the February reading may be weaker than 
in the previous month.

its afternoon session 11.55 points higher at 15,894.
Oil prices continued higher in Asian trading hours as the market focused on concerns about developments in Iran

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in April, was up 0.20 usd at 63.56 usd from its close of 
63.36 usd in the US overnight.
Back in London, a report in The Times suggests BT is being examined as a potential bid target by a number of 
global private equity firms in a move that could value the telecoms group at a minimum of 20 bln stg.
In domestic corporate news, leisure group Rank is scheduled to issue full-year results. Dresdner Kleinwort 
Wasserstein anticipates a pretax profit of 105.8 mln stg, down from 111.9 mln stg the year before.
The company has been the subject of bid speculation, with William Hill and Hilton seen as potential suitors.
Pubs group JD Wetherspoon is set to report first-half numbers. Altium Securities forecasts pretax profit of 24.5 mln 
stg, up from 22.3 mln the year before.
Investors will hope to hear management's views on the anticipated impact of the Scottish smoking ban, which is 
due to take effect on March 26, with the blanket smoking ban in England arriving in summer 2007.
London shares outlook - modestly higher with bid talk surrounding BT
Elsewhere, British Airways and Ryanair are both due to publish traffic figures for February.
On the economic front, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's measure for service sector performance 
is seen remaining steady at 57.0 for the second month running in February.
A reading above 50 marks expansion.
But many analysts doubt that service-sector growth in the first quarter will match the levels seen in the last three 
months of 2005. Additionally, a significant number of analysts predict that the February reading may be weaker than 
in the previous month.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' by UBS, with an 
improved target price of 9.5 eur from 8.6 eur, dealers said.
UBS said Ryanair is a safer way to get exposure to growth in the low-cost market.
The broker said both Ryanair and easyJet PLC should be able to grow in Europe, with easyJet growing in more 
central airports and winning market share from the incumbents, with Ryanair finding growth in lower-cost airports, 
which will promote lower fares and stimulate demand.
UBS also raised its target price for easyJet from 380 pence to 405 pence.

LONDON (AFX) - easyJet PLC, Europe's second largest no-frills airline, said it is now offering online check-in on all 
routes from London Stansted, London Gatwick and Edinburgh airports and is in the process of rolling-out the 
service across Europe.
The Luton-based carrier said its move follows a trial earlier this month. It reckons by April, the service should be 
available to 90 pct of easyJet's UK passengers.
Online check-in allows passengers with hand baggage only to bypass the check-in queue by printing-off their 
boarding pass from their own computer.
easyJet passengers who have checked-in online will be able to arrive at the boarding gate 15 minutes before the 
scheduled departure time. The airline said this is a more generous time than that offered by any other airline.
Last month Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills carrier, said it would allow all customers to check-in 
online from March 16. A similar move was announced last year by smaller rival Flybe.

---- by James Etheridge ----
HELSINKI (AFX) - Finnair's margins are set to remain under pressure for the time being amid rising running costs 
and increased competition in Europe, but the carrier is well positioned to benefit from medium-term downturn in fuel 
prices, analysts said.
Strong demand, particularly in Asian traffic, combined with ongoing measures to cut costs helped Finnair lift 
operating profit almost threefold in 2005 to 70.1 mln eur.
But sustaining this level of profitability will be a tall order in the current operating environment, they added.
'In the short term the situation really is demanding and we expect earnings to decline in 2006,' said Pekka 
Spolander, an analyst at Opstock Securities.
'The company's forecast that fuel costs will rise from around 16 pct of sales in 2005 to 20 pct this year means a cost 
increase of close to 100 mln eur, which is really difficult to compensate for.'
Furthermore, the scope that Finnair has to raise ticket prices has narrowed in a tightly competitive European 
market, where several no-frills operators are becoming increasingly pan-European.
Competition has intensified of late with Ryanair, Air Berlin and Blue1 - part of rival Nordic carrier SAS - now all 
running routes out of Finland, and another budget operator, Sterling, due to start flying out of Helsinki at the end of 
March.
But the extent of the challenge posed to Finnair by these players should not be overstated, analysts said.
'Pricing looks to be difficult at the moment for Finnair. However, some of the low-cost capacity announced for 
Helsinki seems to be at risk due to low profitability,' said Robin Johansson, analyst at Mandatum Stockbrokers.
Johanssons comments follow recent reports that Sterling is already considering axing three of its 11 proposed 
routes out of Helsinki.
Finnairs answer to the threat of low-cost carriers is its Stockholm-based FlyNordic operation, but analysts question 
how well this business fits with Finnairs overall strategy.
FOCUS Finnair margins to stay under pressure until fuel prices ease
'FlyNordic is clearly a means for Finnair to compete with SAS on the Swedish market. However on the European 
routes out of Finland, FlyNordic provides no weapon,' said Johansson.
Spolander agreed, noting that it does little to capitalise on Finnairs ability to provide the fastest connections 
between many European cities and Asia that is afforded it by Helsinkis geographical position.
'FlyNordic has no connection with the Asian traffic and it seems major volumes will be hard to achieve,' he said.
Meanwhile, Finnairs Asian business will continue to grow strongly this year as it adds new destinations and 
increases capacity further.
The current plan is to launch one or two new Asian destinations annually. But the downside of Finnairs success in 
the region is that the area has become very attractive to competitors.
'In the short term I do not expect the low-cost carriers to start competing in Asian traffic, but in the longer term, why 
would the low-cost carriers stay out of this growing market?' asked Spolander.
'So far Finnair has been able to keep the price level of Asian traffic satisfactory.'
The picture in Europe is more downbeat.
'I do not expect the European business to perform too well. Its role is mainly to feed passengers to Asian routes,' 
Spolander said.
But both analysts agreed that Finnair's plan to operate the new smaller and more cost-efficient Embraer aircraft for 
short European routes will generate savings and increase load factors.
The launch of these planes is the latest in a series of measures aimed at cutting costs, and Finnair CEO Jukka 
Hienonen acknowledges that expenditure needs to fall further still.
But even on the back of the cost-cutting done across the business to date, Finnair should be well-placed to benefit 
as fuel prices ease.
'For the moment, the situation does look a bit squeezed, but if there is any improvement in pricing in the mid-term 
Finnair will definitely be a winner,' said Johansson.

LONDON (AFX) - Any bid for airports operator BAA PLC should raise the issue of the firm's 'dominant' position in 
the sector, said Conservative shadow transport secretary Chris Grayling.
Commenting on the possible takeover of BAA by Grupo Ferrovial SA, Grayling said if there were a bid for BAA 'then 
there are bound to be calls for its dominant position to be considered by the competition authorities'.
'This (takeover speculation) is likely to bring back to the forefront the debate over whether BAA has too much 
dominance over airport provision in the UK,' he said.
'We are already extremely anxious about plans to levy an extra charge on passengers at Heathrow to pay for a new 
runway at Stansted (also owned by the British company).'
The Conservatives did not want to comment on the repercussions of Britain's major airports potentially falling into 
foreign hands, saying it was essentially a 'private commercial matter'.
BAA was protected by a government-held golden share, but that was removed three years ago by EU rules 
abolishing them. It has proposed a 1 stg per passenger levy at Heathrow to pay for a new Stansted runway.
British Airways PLC said it would call for a break-up of BAA if the levy were introduced as it effectively would 
subsidise expansion of the main hub of Ryanair Holdings PLC.

VALLETTA (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Irish low-cost airline, will hold talks with Maltese officials this week to 
try and open a route to the Mediterranean island by next year, a Maltese business group said.
Ryanair is seeking access to Malta amid a debate here over the likely impact of low-cost airlines on the tourism 
industry.
'The government should decide early, so that Malta will not lose another year for Ryanair to operate,' said Vince 
Farrugia, leader of the island's small and medium business association.
'Malta would benefit from a larger volume of tourist traffic through low-cost airlines,' he said.
Ryanair said it believes the new Malta flights would carry in excess of 1 mln passengers within the first year of 
operations.
Malta, the smallest EU state, is a popular sunshine destination and receives more than 1.2 mln tourists annually.
Tourism Minister Francis Zammit Dimech said the government was concerned no-frill carriers could create a 
'dangerous' monopoly, pushing out traditional operators.
'Analysis has shown that there could be immediate growth in the industry both with and without low-cost airlines,' he 
told industry representatives on Wednesday.
Malta earned 472.8 mln eur from tourism in the first nine months of 2005, an increase of 3.5 pct over the previous 
year, according to government figures.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC have been downgraded to 'neutral' from 'buy' at UBS on 
valuation, dealers said.
UBS said its price target of 860 pence means there is not enough upside to maintain a 'buy' recommendation, 
prompting the downgrade.
However, the broker noted that the low-cost airline's shares have had a 20 pct rally in the past year, while 
continuing to focus on growth in Europe and said this will continue to underpin the current valuations.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is likely to be in focus on Tuesday as investors digest the findings of this 
evening's screening of a Channel 4 investigation into Europe's largest no-frills airline.
The television station's Dispatches programme, which goes out at 8.00 pm, claims to investigate 'the real cost of 
flying low cost'.
It documents the findings of two undercover journalists who posed as Ryanair cabin crew and filmed secretly over a 
five month period. A series of allegations are made relating to the Dublin-based carrier's safety, crew standards and 
cabin cleanliness.
Channel 4 has promoted the programme with full page newspaper advertisements picturing a napping Ryanair flight 
attendant.
In a statement the airline said it had not yet seen the film and criticised the programme makers for not allowing it a 
live interview, unedited pre-recorded interview, or unedited statement.
'If there are any examples of isolated breaches of Ryanairs own policies and procedures presented in the 
programme, then these naturally will be the subject of a full investigation by Ryanair and any such investigation will 
be conducted in cooperation with both the Irish and the UK aviation regulatory authorities,' said chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair has also published on its website the entire exchange of correspondence between it and Channel 4.
At 1.09 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.11 eur at 7.63.

The television station's Dispatches programme, which goes out at 8.00 pm, claims to investigate 'the real cost of 
flying low cost'.
It documents the findings of two undercover journalists who posed as Ryanair cabin crew and filmed secretly over a 
five month period. A series of allegations are made relating to the Dublin-based carrier's safety, crew standards and 
cabin cleanliness.
Channel 4 has promoted the programme with full page newspaper advertisements picturing a napping Ryanair flight 
attendant.
In a statement the airline said it had not yet seen the film and criticised the programme makers for not allowing it a 
live interview, unedited pre-recorded interview, or unedited statement.
'If there are any examples of isolated breaches of Ryanairs own policies and procedures presented in the 
programme, then these naturally will be the subject of a full investigation by Ryanair and any such investigation will 
be conducted in cooperation with both the Irish and the UK aviation regulatory authorities,' said chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair has also published on its website the entire exchange of correspondence between it and Channel 4.
At 1.09 pm shares in Ryanair were down 0.11 eur at 7.63.

Congress in Barcelona), LLOYDS TSB (rumours of a near-4 bln stg cash bid from Spain's BBVA refuse to lie 
down) - INVESTMENT EXTRA: Brian O'Conner comments on AFREN (though Afren, like all explorers, is risky and 
you should set a stop loss at 45 pence, that could give it a good deal of further upside); QINETIQ (looks 
a buy; but do not chase them too far if the price gets over-excited next week)
SUNDAY PRESS COMMENT
Telegraph
Equity View: BP (hold on; a 65 bln usd handout over the next three years should not be sniffed at), BRIXTON (hang 
on in there), SAVILLS (buy), ASIAN CITRUS (well known to private client stockbrokers but not to retail investors 
and could be a good buy) - THE NUMBERS GAME: Tony Jackson comments on BOC (if I held BOC shares, I'd 
thank LINDE nicely and sell)
    Sunday Times
 SPECIAL REPORT: DOMINO'S PIZZA (the fast-food chain is mushrooming across Britain with new franchises) - 
INSIDE THE CITY: Richard Fletcher comments on EUROTUNNEL (why anyone thinks the company's equity is worth 
725 mln stg is beyond me), KESA ELECTRICALS (Kesa's experience (pulling a bond issue) certainly suggests 
that funding highly leveraged deals in the retail sector may not prove as easy as it once was), BANCO 
SANTANDER (what could be on its shopping list? ALLIANCE & LEICESTER, BRADFORD & BINGLEY or NORTHERN ROCK  
most obvious targets, although some think it may look further afield at the likes of ROYAL & SUN ALLIANCE 
or even Scottish Widows) - DIRECTORS' DEALS: SKYEPHARMA (new non-executive chairman Argeris 'Jerry' 
Karabelas buys 200,000 shares at just over 40 pence each; founder and former chairman Ian Gowrie-Smith 
also acquires 500,000 shares, increasing his holding to 8.2 mln shares); EASYJET (new chief executive buys 
134,000 at just over 374 pence) 
The Business
THE ALCHEMIST: Clem Chambers says WOOLWORTHS looks cheap - MID-CAP INVESTOR: HAYS (look good 
value) - AIM INVESTOR: BOOTH INDUSTRIES (a speculative buy) - BENCHMARK: Rupert Steiner comments on 
TESCO (shareholders will be hoping the pint-sized convenience store project won't become a super-sized mistake), 
DISNEY, BOOTS (post-merger board will be too big for Boots)
    Mail on Sunday
 MIDAS: MANAGEMENT CONSULTING GROUP (for courageous investors, the shares are a buy), QINETIC (on 
fundamentals, they do not appear to be worth chasing); MIDASDUPLICATE!: FORTH PORTS (tipped here last 
month at 1,595 pence; they have since topped 17 stg, but still present a good opportunity), MCBRIDE (hold 
on), ENTERPRISE INNS (sell for a 11 pct profit)

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' at Citigroup, as the 
valuation now looks attractive after a 9 pct decline in the share price over the last week, said dealers.
Ryanair reported third-quarter results last week, which were slighter lower than Citigroup's expectations.
Citigroup has lowered its ticket price decline forecast to down 7.5 pct from down 5 pct for the March quarter, 
resulting in a drop in net income estimate to 300 mln eur from 307 mln eur previously.
Despite weaker short-term earnings, Citigroup said it would expect Ryanair's long-term earnings to benefit from its 
competitive cost advantage, capacity restraint by competitors and ongoing initiatives to lower the cost base.
Citigroup has raised its EPS forecast for Ryanair slightly for 2007 to 42.7 cents from 42.0 as a result of lower airport 
handling charges and in turn the broker has lifted its target price to 8.60 eur from 8.4.

Ryanair FY guidance unchanged as Q3 profit rises 6 pct

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said its full year profit guidance remains 
unchanged as it reported a 6 pct increase for its third quarter.
For the three months to Dec 31 2005 the airline made a net profit (adjusted profit after tax) of 36.8 mln eur, slightly 
below analysts' consensus forecast of about 38 mln eur but up from 34.8 mln eur last time.
This was achieved on the back of a 27 pct rise in total revenue to 370.7 mln eur.
Passenger traffic grew 26 pct to 8.6 mln, whilst yields (average fares) were, as expected, almost flat.
Unit costs increased 3 pct, as fuel costs rose 59 pct to 114.9 mln eur. Excluding fuel, unit costs fell 6 pct.
The higher fuel costs meant Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin fell 2 points to 10 pct.
'We remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fourth quarter,' said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
'We expect to achieve significant increases in passenger volumes but also anticipate that yields in Q4 will fall, 
reflecting our large capacity growth in this weakest winter quarter as well as the impact of Easter falling in April (it 
was in March last year).
'These factors should result in yields being towards the middle of the range of 5 pct to 10 pct, previously guided. 
Our full year net profit guidance is therefore unchanged' -- year to March 31 2006 net profit of 295 mln eur, up 10 
pct on the previous year.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC were lower after third quarter numbers from Europe's largest no-
frills airline came in marginally below analysts' forecasts, dealers said.
At 10.21 am, the shares were trading at 7.42 eur, down 0.3.
The company said its full year profit guidance remains unchanged as it reported a 6 pct increase for its third 
quarter.
For the three months to Dec 31 2005 the carrier made a net profit of 36.8 mln eur, slightly below analysts' 
consensus forecast of about 38 mln eur, but up from 34.8 mln eur last time.
Following the numbers, Cheuvreux repeated its 'buy' advice but said fuel costs were significantly higher than 
expectations.
The broker believes the key for the stock is the outlook for yields and fuel costs.
'Neither has really changed today leaving the stock struggling to generate much earnings growth in 2007. We would 
be tempted to take profits on these results,' said Cheuvreux analyst Owen Gibbons.
Morgan Stanley reiterated its 'equal-weight' recommendation but lifted its 'fair-value' price target by 14 pct to 9.1 
eur.
In a research note, the broker said the market should be satisfied with a good quarter of operations from Ryanair. 
However, it described the earnings guidance as 'cautious'.
SG reiterated its 'buy' recommendation but also said the share price might be weak today on concerns over fuel 
prices.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, is expected to report a 9 pct increase in 
net profit when it publishes third quarter results today.
For the three months to Dec 31 2005, analysts are forecasting a net profit of about 38 mln eur, up from 35 mln eur 
last time.
Ryanair recently reiterated its guidance for the full year to March 31, 2006 -- net profit of 295 mln eur, up 10 pct on 
the previous year.
The airline has flagged that third quarter yields (fares) will be 'broadly in line' with last year, while fourth quarter 
yields will fall by 5-10 pct.
The fourth quarter fall reflects capacity growth and the lack of an Easter in the period this year. Yields for the full 
year are expected to be more or less flat.
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is forecasting an above consensus third quarter net profit of 40 mln eur -- a 
prediction driven by a 25 pct rise in passenger volumes, a 3 pct rise in average ticket prices and a 3 pct rise in unit 
costs.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are tipped to open lower, taking their cue from losses on Wall Street on Friday, 
and further hit by a spike in oil prices, but renewed bid talk in the weekend press could provide some support, 
dealers said.
CMC Markets expect the FTSE 100 index to open down 1 point at around 5758, having closed 12.00 higher at 
5759.3 on Friday.
Meanwhile, in New York shares closed for the weekend lower, capping a week of losses for the market after the 
Fed left open the possibility of further interest-rate increases, with a solid January jobs report only serving to build 
the case for higher rates.
Disappointing earnings from a number of high-profile companies including Google and Amazon also weighed on 
sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 58.36 points at 10,793.62, the Nasdaq fell 18.99 to 2,262.58 and 
the S&P 500 dropped 6.81 to 1,264.03.
In Asia overnight the mood was mixed, the Nikkei 225 was down 80.58 at 16,579.06, while the Hang Seng was up 
67.12 at 15,496.85 by midday.
Still in Asia, oil prices jumped more than 1.00 usd on fears of supply disruptions after the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) voted to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.
Earlier this morning, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in March, was up 1.03 usd at 66.40 
usd per barrel, compared to 65.37 usd in the US Friday.
Back in London, on the economic front, all eyes will be on Thursday's Bank of England rate decision with most 
pundits expecting the cost of borrowing to stay at 4.50 pct for the sixth month running.
As for equities, a list of big hitters are due to publish results later in the week, including BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Rolls-
Royce, BT and Smith & Nephew.
But today, in the absence of blue chip news, mid cap Autonomy will garner attention when the business software 
group issues fourth quarter figures.
London shares outlook - touch lower on Wall St, oil price; M&A, BoE eyed
Citigroup is looking for licence revenues of 14.2 mln usd, total revenues of 31.5 mln, EBITA of 9.4 mln.
Ryanair will also be in the spotlight after Europe's largest no-frills airline reported third quarter adjusted net profit of 
36.8 mln eur against 34.8 mln previously.
The group also said yields were 'almost flat' and fuel costs were 114.9 mln eur, up 59 pct from last time.
Looking to the future, it said it was cautious on the fourth quarter, with yields expected to come in the middle of the -
5 to -10 range previously forecast.
For the three months to Dec 31 2005, analysts were forecasting a net profit of about 38 mln eur, up from 35 mln eur 
last time.
Cambridge Antibody is set to publish first quarter numbers with Credit Suisse looking for revenue of 12.8 mln stg on 
an operating loss of 2 mln stg.
Investors will be more keen though on hearing news on the biotech group's pipeline and any updates on the 
ongoing search for partners for its severe asthma treatment, CAT-354.
With the lack of scheduled news, investors will turn to the weekend press for inspiration with further M&A 
speculation likely to steal the headlines.
According to the Sunday Times, private-equity groups Apax Partners, CVC Capital and Texas Pacific are 
understood to be considering a joint bid for Boots, the high-street pharmacist.
Boots is expected this week to see its 7.6 bln stg merger with Alliance UniChem referred to the Competition 
Commission, but the report claimed a number of its biggest investors are restless over the deal and if a cash bid is 
pitched at the right level they may be tempted to accept.
Still in retail, the same paper said Hellman & Friedman and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are in the early stages of a 6 
bln stg bid for Experian, the credit-checking arm of GUS.
Cable & Wireless will continue to be under scrutiny after the Independent on Sunday said private equity groups 
circling the telecoms group have abandoned plans for a takeover after last week's profits warning.
But the Business claimed Thus is mulling a bid for its UK operations through a nil-premium merger.
And in pharmas, GlaxoSmithKline plans a bargain swoop on Swiss biotech group Serono, the Sunday Times wrote.
The UK drugs giant is said to have indicated that it is willing to enter into negotiations but is not prepared to pay 
much more than 6.2 bln stg.
Turning to the leisure sector, Whitbread is working on a 1 bln stg bid for privately-owned budget hotel chain 
Travelodge, The Sunday Times reported.
Still in M&A, The Telegraph claimed that HMV, the music and books chain being stalked by Permira, is braced for a 
formal takeover offer worth 800 mln stg as soon as this week.
Meanwhile, Sunday Express claimed Tim Waterstone, the founder of the Waterstone's book chain, is putting 
together a 250 mln stg deal to buy it back from HMV.
In financials, US hedge fund Polygon is threatening to scupper Prudentials plan to take control of Egg, the internet 
bank it intends's to de-list in a fortnight's time.
Polygon is refusing to sell its Egg shares to Prudential in a bid to try to force the insurance giant to pay more for the 
shares than it had offered to other shareholders, the Sunday Times reported.
London shares outlook - touch lower on Wall St, oil price; M&A, BoE eyed
Both the Independent on Sunday and Mail on Sunday say Unilever is set to unveil the sale of its frozen foods arm, 
including Birds Eye, as early as this week, leading to a potential cash bonanza for shareholders.
Elsewhere, The Observer reported ITV is facing a break-up threat from rebel shareholders who want it to demerge 
its production operation from its broadcasting business as part of an audacious bid to extract value for long-
suffering investors.
The plan is understood to have received informal support from Brandes, the American value investor that speaks 
for 7 pct of the media group's equity.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) --U.S.-listed shares of European companies traded lower Monday afternoon, pressured 
by a listless Wall Street and heavy losses among pharmaceutical shares.
The Bank of New York Europe American Depositary Receipt Index was last down 0.22 point to 140.05 and the 
overall Composite Index was 0.1 point higher to 141.68.
Earlier, European shares managed slight gains during Continental trade but the mood shifted when the action 
switched to Wall Street, where stocks were mixed as Middle East tensions boosted crude-oil prices. .
Drugmaker losses were heavily represented among the most-actively traded ADRs. Shares of volume leader Elan 
Corp. fell as much as 1.5%. Novartis shares slipped as much as 1.6%. Sanofi Aventis shares lost as much as 1%.
Oil and gas shares enjoyed solid gains but were unable to carry ADRs forward. Repsol YPF shares rose as much 
as 4.6%. The Spanish press reported that BP and Italy's Eni are each considering takeover bids for the Spanish-
Argentine refiner following the expiration of the Spanish government's golden share.
Madrid-based Banco Urquijo, however, said in a note to investors Monday that Repsol could still begin to develop a 
defensive strategy, conducting acquisitions to prevent hostile bids against it, Dow Jones reported.
Repsol's shares lost nearly 9% on Jan. 26 -- a drop it has yet to recover -- when the company announced it would 
cut its reserves by 25% for the year 2005 compared with 2004, said Dow Jones.
Banking shares were mixed after Goldman Sachs upgraded the sector on the heels of takeover speculation 
sparked by BNP Paribas's offer for Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
Analysts said banks are undervalued compared with the wider European market and noted fundamentals for the 
sector remain positive.
Among the sector's biggest gainers, Credit Suisse Group shares rose as much as 2.3%. Abn Amro shares climbed 
as much as 1%. Lloyd's shares slipped 0.08%.
In earnings news, Ryanair fell as much as 2.5% after the budget airline said third-quarter profit declined 21%, in 
part due to higher fuel costs.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- Airline stocks started the week on a down note Monday as oil prices rose after Iran's 
nuclear program was referred to the United Nations, a move that energy traders fear could lead to trade sanctions
The Amex Airline Index lost almost 2% to 50.38 points in morning trade, with Continental Airlines leading the 
decline, off 3.3% at $20.11.
Other notable decliners included SkyWest , down 2.9% at $28.40, and JetBlue Airways , down 2% at $11.52. 
JetBlue's low-cost rival, Southwest Airlines , fell only fractionally to $16.39.
On the earnings front, Ryanair Holdings , Europe's largest low-cost airline, said profit declined 21% due to higher 
fuel costs and a year-ago accounting-related gain. U.S.-listed shares fell 2.5% to $52.23 in early trades.
Elsewhere, US Airways Group shares shed 1.6% to $29.08 after the fifth-biggest airline in the United States said 
traffic, which includes America West-operated flights, fell 5.5% in January as capacity declined.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, is expected to report a 9 pct increase in 
net profit when it publishes third quarter results on Monday.
For the three months to Dec 31 2005, analysts are forecasting a net profit of about 38 mln eur, up from 35 mln eur 
last time.
Ryanair recently reiterated its guidance for the full year to March 31, 2006 -- net profit of 295 mln eur, up 10 pct on 
the previous year.
The airline has flagged that third quarter yields (fares) will be 'broadly in line' with last year, while fourth quarter 
yields will fall by 5-10 pct.
The fourth quarter fall reflects capacity growth and the lack of an Easter in the period this year. Yields for the full 
year are expected to be more or less flat.
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is forecasting an above consensus third quarter net profit of 40 mln eur -- a 
prediction driven by a 25 pct rise in passenger volumes, a 3 pct rise in average ticket prices and a 3 pct rise in unit 
costs.

STOCKWATCH Lufthansa upped to 'buy' at Citigroup , EasyJet , Ryanair cut to 'hold

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Citigroup has upgraded its stance on shares in Deutsche Lufthansa AG to 'buy' from 'hold' 
and hiked its price target to 15.80 eur from 11.40, while it downgraded both EasyJet PLC and Ryanair PLC to 'hold' 
from 'buy' in an airlines review, dealers said.
Commenting on its upgrade of Lufthansa, the broker said: '(Lufthansa's) share price has underperformed the sector 
over the last year (and) outperformance is possible, catalysed by restructuring success and possible 
disposals/IPOs,'
It added that the probability of further disposals and possible IPOs of one or two of Lufthansa's divisions has 
increased, partly because of the buoyant equity market conditions -- the Thomas Cook segment being the most 
likely IPO.
Commenting on group earnings, the broker said it expects further earnings increases in 2006 and 2007 after 
Lufthansa recently hiked its 2005 operating profit guidance, with the core passenger and cargo airlines, catering 
and Thomas Cook driving most of the improvement.
In pre-bourse trade, at 8.15 am, shares in Lufthansa were changing hands at between 12.92 and 13.01 eur, 
according to Lang & Schwarz brokerage, compared to yesterday's close at 12.78.
On EasyJet, Citigroup said it had downgraded the shares because they are trading at levels near its 400p price 
target and because it does not regard the company as a takeover target.
While also downgrading Ryanair, the broker raised its target price on the low-frills airline to 8.40 eur from 8.00.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- The New York-to-Boston route is 'not for the faint of heart,' says JetBlue Airways 
president Dave Barger.
JetBlue chose that heavily traveled corridor in early November to try out the first of its newest planes, whose 100 
seats mean its capacity is about one-third smaller than the airline's mainstay jets.
It was no ordinary part of the country to introduce the Brazilian-built plane.
First there's the formidable winter weather. Then the fierce competition. And the mix of business travelers and 
college kids. And it's one of the busiest travel markets.
But such conditions made for exactly the kind of mix JetBlue wanted for the debut the Embraer 190, with 56 fewer 
seats than its workhorse Airbus A320. Changing planes like that is all the more remarkable for an airline with an 
increasing group of its most faithful fliers drawn to the consistent service and feel of the bigger Airbus jets.
'I think truly the risk would've been not moving forward with the Embraer 190 as opposed to moving forward with 
[it],' Barger said. Customer and crew member feedback has so far been good, he said.
Most low-cost carriers don't mix up their fleets, but JetBlue is moving ahead, becoming the first airline to put the 
plane into use, and it has committed to acquiring 101 of them, with options for 100 more. The shift in strategy 
comes at a critical time as the company's profitability is on the wane.
Though it operates an uncommonly lean business with high margins by its industry's standards, the low-cost carrier 
isn't immune to high fuel costs.
On Wednesday, JetBlue is expected to report a first-ever annual loss, according to a Thomson First Call survey. 
The airline needs revenue from new routes served by the Embraer jet as well as its other Airbus jets it's acquiring to 
grow faster than its costs.
New rules
JetBlue believes the Embraer 190 will give it the ability to fly to 800 new routes. On those it already serves, 
executives say, it can better match capacity with demand -- smoothing out earnings by reducing the number of 
empty seats in the off-season.
JetBlue has big hopes in experiment with smaller planes 
The unwritten rule of low-cost carriers is to operate just one type of plane, as Southwest Airlines has done with its 
Boeing Co.-built 737s. Ryanair , its European counterpart, uses the same approach.
But JetBlue and some outside observers are confident that adding the Embraer 190 will pay off.
'It'll fit very nicely into markets that are seasonally unattractive with the Airbus or just plain smaller,' said Robert 
Mann, president of airline consulting firm R.W. Mann & Co.
JetBlue will end 2005 with seven 190s and get 19 more next year. It has ordered 101 of them and holds options for 
another 100.
The 190 is a big plane, just 7 feet shorter than the Airbus A320, though its wingspan is much narrower. But tall 
travelers won't have to stoop like on a regular regional jet and the seats don't require squeezing into.
Because it has more seats than a smaller regional jet, the cost of a trip is far less than has traditionally been the 
case on a shorter route.
And for a brand with as much buzz as JetBlue has made with its amenities, being able to offer its hallmark free 
satellite TV service just like the bigger Airbus jets is key.
New routes
On one hand, the Embraer 190 complicates JetBlue's business model and comes at a time when margins are 
under pressure.
Regular customers used to one plane have to get familiar another. Pilots, crews and ground workers also are 
working with new equipment. They need training and must get the planes unloaded and loaded as fast as possible 
with each flight.
On the other, the plane's 2,100-nautical mile range puts more cities on JetBlue's map and can help the airline 
precisely throttle back capacity on routes during off-peak seasons.
'It's considered to be a good aircraft, flexible and right sized. It's pitched at a market that's current and developing 
as opposed to the 50- and 70-seaters that are really past it,' said Doug McVitie, managing director of aviation 
consulting firm Arran Aerospace.
When JetBlue laid out the specs it wanted on the new plane, Barger said the company wanted to be able connect 
Boston or New York to Salt Lake City.
The plane can do that flight or to Denver, where headwinds and altitude are a challenge.
'It's a huge step up from the original, even second-generation, small jets,' said Mann, who worked with Embraer on 
development of the 190 and the smaller Embraer 170.
Suddenly, new destinations in the Carolinas or more flights to Florida start to make sense.
Next year, JetBlue will begin flying to Austin, Texas and Richmond, Va., as well, with the Embraer.
'It's very hard to open those type of cities with any kind of schedule with a 156-seat airplane, which is the size that 
we have on the Airbus,' Barger said. 'That's the beauty of having this 100-seat airplane.'

Next year, JetBlue will begin flying to Austin, Texas and Richmond, Va., as well, with the Embraer.
'It's very hard to open those type of cities with any kind of schedule with a 156-seat airplane, which is the size that 
we have on the Airbus,' Barger said. 'That's the beauty of having this 100-seat airplane.'

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- The New York-to-Boston route is 'not for the faint of heart,' says JetBlue Airways 
president Dave Barger.
JetBlue started service on that heavily traveled corridor in early November with its newest plane, whose 100 seats 
make its capacity about one-third smaller than the airline's mainstay jets.
It was no ordinary part of the country to introduce the Brazilian-built plane.
First there's the formidable winter weather. Then the fierce competition. And the mix of business travelers and 
college kids. And it's one of the busiest travel markets.
But such conditions made for exactly the kind of mix JetBlue wanted for the debut the 100-seat Brazilian-made 
Embraer 190, with 56 fewer seats than its workhorse Airbus A320. Changing planes like that is all the more 
remarkable for an airline with an increasing group of its most faithful fliers drawn to the consistent service and feel 
of the bigger Airbus jets.
'I think truly the risk would've been not moving forward with the Embraer 190 as opposed to moving forward with 
[it],' Barger said. Customer and crew member feedback has so far been good, he said.
Most low-cost carriers don't mix up their fleets, but JetBlue is moving ahead, becoming the first airline to put the 
plane into use, and it has committed to acquiring 101 of them, with options for 100 more. The shift in strategy 
comes at a critical time as the company's profitability is on the wane.
Though it operates an uncommonly lean business with high margins by its industry's standards, the low-cost carrier 
isn't immune to high fuel costs.
On Wednesday, JetBlue is expected to report a first-ever annual loss, according to a Thomson First Call survey. 
The airline needs revenue from new routes served by the Embraer jet as well as its other Airbus jets it's acquiring to 
grow faster than its costs.
New rules
JetBlue has big hopes in experiment with smaller planes
JetBlue believes the Embraer 190 will give it the ability to fly to 800 new routes. On those it already serves, 
executives say, it can better match capacity with demand -- smoothing out earnings by reducing the number of 
empty seats in the off-season.
The unwritten rule of low-cost carriers is to operate just one type of plane, as Southwest Airlines has done with its 
Boeing Co.-built 737s. Ryanair , its European counterpart, uses the same approach.
But JetBlue and some outside observers are confident that adding the Embraer 190 will pay off.
'It'll fit very nicely into markets that are seasonally unattractive with the Airbus or just plain smaller,' said Robert 
Mann, president of airline consulting firm R.W. Mann & Co.
JetBlue will end 2005 with seven 190s and get 19 more next year. It has ordered 101 of them and holds options for 
another 100.
The 190 is a big plane, just 7 feet shorter than the Airbus A320, though its wingspan is much narrower. But tall 
travelers won't have to stoop like on a regular regional jet and the seats don't require squeezing into.
Because it has more seats than a smaller regional jet, the cost of a trip is far less than has traditionally been the 
case on a shorter route.
And for a brand with as much buzz as JetBlue has made with its amenities, being able to offer its hallmark free 
satellite TV service just like the bigger Airbus jets is key.
New routes
On one hand, the Embraer 190 complicates JetBlue's business model and comes at a time when margins are 
under pressure.
Regular customers used to one plane have to get familiar another. Pilots, crews and ground workers also are 
working with new equipment. They need training and must get the planes unloaded and loaded as fast as possible 
with each flight.
On the other, the plane's 2,100-nautical mile range puts more cities on JetBlue's map and can help the airline 
precisely throttle back capacity on routes during off-peak seasons.
'It's considered to be a good aircraft, flexible and right sized. It's pitched at a market that's current and developing 
as opposed to the 50- and 70-seaters that are really past it,' said Doug McVitie, managing director of aviation 
consulting firm Arran Aerospace.
When JetBlue laid out the specs it wanted on the new plane, Barger said the company wanted to be able connect 
Boston or New York to Salt Lake City.
The plane can do that flight or to Denver, where headwinds and altitude are a challenge.
'It's a huge step up from the original, even second-generation, small jets,' said Mann, who worked with Embraer on 
development of the 190 and the smaller Embraer 170.
Suddenly, new destinations in the Carolinas or more flights to Florida start to make sense.
Next year, JetBlue will begin flying to Austin, Texas and Richmond, Va., as well, with the Embraer.
'It's very hard to open those type of cities with any kind of schedule with a 156-seat airplane, which is the size that 
we have on the Airbus,' Barger said. 'That's the beauty of having this 100-seat airplane.'

(updates with Haji-Ioannou's reaction to Ryanair introducing luggage charge)
DAVOS, Switzerland (AFX) - Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet PLC's founder, said he is not opposed in principle to 
selling his 16.5 pct stake in the budget airline, but that his selling price is so high that it will most likely put off any 
potential buyer.
Speaking in an interview with AFX News at the World Economic Forum annual meeting, Haji-Ioannou said: 'The 
chances are that my selling price, given the other links and sensitivities to the brand and to the company, are above 
someone's rational willingness to pay.'
'In any event whatever happens I still own the brand, which means that I need to approve the person that will buy it, 
or withdraw the brand.'
Speculation has been rife that FL Group, the acquisitive Icelandic group which has built up a 16.2 pct stake in 
easyJet, is poised to bid for the Luton-based no-frills airline.
Goldman Sachs has been appointed adviser to work alongside easyJet's existing broker CSFB.
FL owns Icelandair, the country's national airline, and last October bought Copenhagen-based Sterling Airways, 
Europe's fourth biggest budget airline, for 240 mln usd.
Stelios' brother Polys and sister Clelia each hold a 12 pct stake in easyJet, making the family interest 40.5 pct.
Asked if he would approve of FL continuing to use the easyJet brand if it did acquire easyJet, Haji-Ioannou said: 'I 
don't know enough about them. There are many things that you have to look at before you approve a licensee, 
because that is what they would be.'
'I want to be satisfied that they will run it well and that they're well capitalised for the financial challenges in this 
business. It's a process that will start if they ever make an offer.'
Haji-Ioannou also reacted to the recent announcement by rival Ryanair Holdings PLC to charge customers a fee if 
they check in any baggage from March 16, saying he was sceptical that the concept would achieve its aim of 
improving efficiency.
DAVOS easyJet founder says selling price would likely put buyers off
The Irish airline claims the move will be cost neutral, or better, for the majority of passengers as it is also 
introducing 'across-the-board' fare cuts of 9 pct, some 2.50 stg (3.50 eur).
'Depending on how they do it, and they may have found a solution for it, I can see two huge bottlenecks that would 
eliminate any efficiency gains,' Haji-Ioannou said.
Those passengers checking in baggage and paying for it at the airport will make check in 'extremely slow', and 
some passengers will try to bring on enormous bags as hand luggage. When they are told on the aircraft that their 
hand luggage is too large, this will cause delays and create animosity.
'It will slow down the aircraft which is a much more expensive asset ... Either he (Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary) 
has found a solution which I haven't thought of or the whole thing is going to be a complete nightmare.'

MILAN (AFX) - Milan's Malpensa airport will be closed until 6 am tomorrow morning because of widespread 
snowfalls, said its SEA operating company.
Earlier today, Alitalia SpA said Malpensa was operating at reduced capacity, and Milan's Linate was shut until 6 pm 
this evening.
In a new statement, Alitalia said it now expects Linate to remain closed until 6 am tomorrow morning.
'Because of the continued adverse weather in the north of Italy, serious delays and cancellations are expected at all 
airports in the area tonight and also for tomorrow,' it said.
Operations are expected to be reduced tomorrow, with flights resuming at 7 am in the morning, weather permitting, 
and with possible delays.
In a separate statement, Sacbo, the operator of Bergamo's Orio al Serio airport, said it reopened at 4 pm after 
closing because of snow this morning.
Ryanair is a major user of the Orio al Serio airport.
In the centre of Milan, snow has started falling again lightly after continuous falls for more than 24 hours up to about 
5 pm.

DAVOS, Switzerland (AFX) - Christoph Franz, CEO of Swiss International Air Lines, the Swiss carrier which is 
being acquired by Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa, said he expects more consolidation in the airline sector but 
warned that if some don't act fast, they may not survive.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting, Franz said: 'My feeling is that 
this industry, which is tremendously driven by economies of scale, will in the future have further consolidation.
'If this consolidation is not happening fast enough, there will be more players leaving the market.'
The industry has already seen failures -- not least Swissair, which re-emerged as Swiss International -- and 
mergers, such as Air France and KLM, as well as major cuts in jobs and capacities.
The sector has come under major pressure to cut costs due to the slump in air traffic after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 
the rise of budget airlines like Ryanair Holdings PLC, SARS, and the rise in oil prices.
Franz said that with surcharges on tickets, airlines have already passed on to customers some of the rise in fuel 
prices, but if oil spikes to 100 usd per barrel -- as feared in the light of the situations in Iran and Nigeria -- some 
airlines will not survive.
'Definitely a sudden increase to 100 usd will present a tremendous challenge to every airline to adopt cost 
measures at high speed, and there may be some players in the market that will not be able to cope with the 
situation fast enough and they will exit the market,' he said. 'But the airline industry will survive.'
Swiss has cut costs dramatically since its re-emergence, but Franz denied that his airline is becoming 'no frills' and 
said that he did not plan to follow Ryanair's lead and introduce a charge for passengers checking luggage.
'We at Swiss International are positioned as a quality carrier. There was an attempt in 2003 to introduce in 
European economy class food and beverages that customers had to pay for.
'But it was our feeling that this touched the genetic code of our brand, so we re-introduced free food and beverages 
last year ... As long as the Swiss cross is on the tail we will be perceived as a quality airline and we should not try

DAVOS, Switzerland (AFX) - Christoph Franz, CEO of Swiss International Air Lines, the Swiss carrier which is 
being acquired by Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa, said he expects more consolidation in the airline sector but 
warned that if some don't act fast, they may not survive.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting, Franz said: 'My feeling is that 
this industry, which is tremendously driven by economies of scale, will in the future have further consolidation.
'If this consolidation is not happening fast enough, there will be more players leaving the market.'
The industry has already seen failures -- not least Swissair, which re-emerged as Swiss International -- and 
mergers, such as Air France and KLM, as well as major cuts in jobs and capacities.
The sector has come under major pressure to cut costs due to the slump in air traffic after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 
the rise of budget airlines like Ryanair Holdings PLC, SARS, and the rise in oil prices.
Franz said that with surcharges on tickets, airlines have already passed on to customers some of the rise in fuel 
prices, but if oil spikes to 100 usd per barrel -- as feared in the light of the situations in Iran and Nigeria -- some 
airlines will not survive.
'Definitely a sudden increase to 100 usd will present a tremendous challenge to every airline to adopt cost 
measures at high speed, and there may be some players in the market that will not be able to cope with the 
situation fast enough and they will exit the market,' he said. 'But the airline industry will survive.'
Swiss has cut costs dramatically since its re-emergence, but Franz denied that his airline is becoming 'no frills' and 
said that he did not plan to follow Ryanair's lead and introduce a charge for passengers checking luggage.
'We at Swiss International are positioned as a quality carrier. There was an attempt in 2003 to introduce in 
European economy class food and beverages that customers had to pay for.
'But it was our feeling that this touched the genetic code of our brand, so we re-introduced free food and beverages 
last year ... As long as the Swiss cross is on the tail we will be perceived as a quality airline and we should not try 
now to copy the low cost airlines.'
He has not yet seen the recent film 'Grounding: The Last Days of Swissair', he added.

BREST, France (AFX) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has confirmed Feb 21 as the day it is to resume 
flights between London-Luton and Brittany in northwestern France with three flights per week to Brest airport.
It had abandoned the route in 2004 after passenger numbers failed to reach expectations.
A source in a chamber of commerce in Brittany had told Agence France-Presse in December that Ryanair was to 
resume the link in Feb 2006.
In today's statement, the airline said it plans to fly 40.000 passengers on the Luton-Brest route in the first year, and 
will create 40 jobs at the French airport.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is introducing a package of measures aimed at streamlining 
boarding procedures which will cut ground costs by 10 pct, equating to 30 mln stg, or 10 pct of Ryanair's forecast 
full-year profits after tax.
However, the 100 mln stg cost of implementing the measures will make the the move revenue neutral, it said.
Passengers checking in baggage on flights booked after March 16 will now pay a fee to do so. The airline will make 
the move cost neutral for most passengers by simultaneously introducing across-the-board fare cuts of 9 pct.
Also from March 16, Ryanair will allow EU passengers travelling with hand luggage only to check in online. These 
passengers will also be given priority boarding status aimed at reducing queues.
The company said it expects 40-50 pct of passengers to switch to the new web check-in/priority boarding service
Chairman Michael O'Leary said the changes will enable Ryanair to reduce its airport and handling costs across the 
network.
'We will require fewer and less expensive airport facilities such as airport check-in and baggage hall facilities. We 
will carry fewer bags, making our aircraft lighter and improving our fuel consumption,' he said.
'Our existing check-in and baggage handling personnel will now be able to accommodate significantly greater traffic 
numbers as we aim to double the size of the airline over the coming five years.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Air France-KLM SA have been upgraded to 'outperform' from 'in-line' by Cazenove, 
while the broker downgraded its rating on British Airways PLC to 'in-line' from 'outperform' and on Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG to 'underperform', dealers said.
In a review of the airlines sector, Cazenove said that after a period of strong share price performance and in view of 
the mixed outlook for earnings growth, it recommended investors take profits in the sector and focus on the stocks 
with the least earnings and sentiment risk.
In Cazenove's opinion, Air France-KLM offers the best combination of value and earnings momentum.
As for British Airways, Cazenove thinks the UK flag carrier faces company- specific threats to short-term investor 
confidence in spite of a robust business model. The broker is downgrading Lufthansa on valuation grounds.
Among the low-cost carriers, Cazenove reiterated its 'in-line' recommendations on Ryanair Holdings PLC and 
easyJet PLC.
Earlier today, CA Cheuvreux upgraded BA to 'outperform' from 'underperform'.
At 10.40 am, shares in Air France were up 0.36 eur at 18.31, Lufthansa was
0.29 eur higher at 12.74, BA was 0-1/2 pence higher at 321-3/4, easyJet was up 2-1/2 at 397-1/4 and Ryanair was 
up 0.05 eur at 7.83.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary has launched a stinging attack on the 
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and BAA PLC, claiming they were responsible for British passengers 'paying the 
highest airport charges in Europe'.
Speaking to parliament's Transport select committee, O'Leary branded the CAA as 'incompetent'.
'We now have one of the most competitive and efficient airline operations in Britain but the least competitive and 
least efficient system in terms of CAA - regulated airports and NATS (National Air Traffic Services),' he said.
'Why, after years of regulation by the CAA, are British passengers paying the highest airport charges in Europe?' he 
said.
He also criticised the CAA's bail out of NATS after it ran into financial trouble following its controversial privatisation 
as a 'a tax on passengers'.
O'Leary described BAA's spending plans at Stansted airport in Essex as 'ludicrous' and that the airport operator 
regarded low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet as 'the crazy boys'.
BAA 'charge the highest charges in Europe and these are passed on to customers', he added.

MANILA (AFX) - The Philippines' Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) decided not to renew the provisional authority of 
Singapore budget airline Tiger Airways Ltd to operate Clark-bound flights from Singapore via Macau after the permit 
expired on Dec 31, 2005, CAB executive director Eduardo Manalac said.
CAB, however, added that it has allowed Tiger Airways to continue its Singapore-Macau-Clark flights for 10 more 
days until January 20 to accommodate passengers who have bought their tickets.
'We don't want their passengers to be inconvenienced,' Manalac said.
Manalac said the aviation board found Tiger Airways guilty of three violations, including advertising and selling of 
seats even before lodging an application with the Philippine industry regulator.
Manalac said Tiger Airways was also found to be charging rates that have not been approved by CAB and falsely 
claiming that its services have obtained the regulator's approval.
Tiger Airways is 49 pct owned by Singapore Airlines, while the Singapore government's investment arm, Temasek 
Holdings, owns 11 pct. Tony Ryan, the founder of European low-cost airline Ryanair, and US private investors 
Indigo Partners are the other partners in the venture.
'While the board is assessing the penalties for these violations, it had decided not to renew Tiger's provisional 
authority,' Manalac said.
'But the board decision will not prejudice Tiger's request for a permanent approval of its Macau stopover.'
He clarified that the carrier's flights to Singapore from Clark were not affected because these had CAB's permanent 
approval.
Tiger Airways began its Macau stopover flights on Oct 30, 2005. But Manalac said CAB learned that Tiger Airways 
had been selling Macau tickets as early as July last year.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC have been downgraded to 'sell' from 'hold' at ABN Amro on 
valuation grounds.
ABN said Ryanair's share price is at levels well above its current target price of 6.8 eur, which has been raised from 
6.7. Yesterday, the stock closed at 8.1 eur.
ABN believes Ryanair's revenue and earnings guidance may prove somewhat conservative, but does not see a 
high probability of March 2006 earnings 'wildly exceeding' consensus.
The broker added that it sees little chance of a big revenue surprise given tough comparison data.
And looking to next year, ABN expects earnings growth to be constrained by the high fuel price.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC have been downgraded to 'sell' by Deutsche 
Bank, while the broker upgraded Air France-KLM SA to 'hold' in a review of the European airline sector, traders 
said.
In Deutsche Bank's view, industry fundamentals, especially on the long-haul, continue to look positive. 
As a result, Deutsche has maintained its 'positive' stance on the entire sector for 2006, though the broker favours 
the flag carriers -- British Airways PLC and Deutsche Lufthansa AG -- over the low-cost carriers such as easyJet 
and Ryanair.
Deutsche explained its preference for the flag carriers due to a mildly inflationary price environment mainly on long-
haul and slowing volume growth for low-cost airlines.
Of the flag carriers, Deutsche noted that in the current positive environment, Air France-KLM's high level of 
operational and financial gearing is a net positive and its market share gains could continue through 2006.
Elsewhere, although BA has challenges from Open Skies, Deutsche highlighted the opportunities from Heathrow 
Airport's Terminal Five. Deutsche kept its 'buy' rating on BA.
The broker also rated Lufthansa as 'buy', though pointed out it needs to see tangible restructuring progress in 2006.
Finally, Deutsche said it is too early to buy Iberia and Austrian Airlines and hence sticks with its 'hold' ratings.

LONDON (AFX) - The FTSE 100 edged higher in midmorning trade, with gains in the energy sector and positive 
broker comments on BAE Systems offsetting a sell-off among the heavyweight miners, dealers said.
At 10.02 am, the FTSE 100 was up 9.5 points at 5,700.6, with the broader indices mixed.
Volume was solid, with 494.3 mln shares changing hands in 45,674 deals.
Further direction for the market will come this afternoon from the release of December US nonfarm payroll data, as 
traders assess the Fed's next move on interest rates. Economists are expecting a gain of around 200,000 jobs in 
the month.
In London, BAE Systems jumped 3.6 pct, or 14-1/2 pct, to 408 after UBS raised its price target on the aerospace 
and defence group to 500 pence from 400 previously. UBS cited two 'very positive' announcements made last 
month - firstly, Saudi Arabia intends to purchase significant new equipment and services; secondly, the UK's 
Ministry of Defence has published a new 'Defence Industrial Strategy' which UBS said is very supportive for BAE 
and the UK defence industry.
Elsewhere, energy stocks moved higher, tracking a rise in oil prices, with New York's main contract, light sweet 
crude for delivery in February, up 0.42 usd at 63.21 usd a barrel.
BP rose 3-1/2 pence to 638, BG was up 3-1/2 at 600 and RD Shell gained 9 at 1,922.
Airline stocks were in focus as Deutsche Bank issued a review of the sector, repeating its 'buy' recommendation on 
British Airways but downgrading easyJet and Ryanair to 'sell'.
BA rose 2-3/4 pence to 337-3/4, while easyJet dropped 1-1/4 pence to 376-1/2 and Ryanair fell 0.12 eur to 7.94.
In other news, shares in Amvescap extended recent gains as Bear Stearns turned bullish on the asset manager, 
upgrading its recommendation to 'outperform' from 'peer perform'.
The upgrade, explained Bear Stearns, reflects the expected higher equity market performance and recovery in the 
AIM US fund flows in the longer term.
London shares edge higher amid strength in energy stocks; BAE gains 3.6 pct
Amvescap rose 2-3/4 pence to 470-3/4.
On the M&A front, ITV put in a strong performance following a report from Breakingviews highlighting the possibility 
of a takeover by BT Group. According to the article, 'a deal would see ITV's concerns about suffering for lack of a 
digital distribution platform. And it could, at a stroke, turn BT into a real competitor to Sky and NTL.
Meanwhile, Unilever was up 6 pence at 579-1/2 after rumours circulated late yesterday afternoon that Kraft could 
be interested in making a bid for the group.
Mining stocks featured among the blue chip fallers this morning, as copper futures fell overnight and the gold price 
pulled back on profit taking. New FTSE 100 entrant Kazakhmys was also hit by Citigroup initiating coverage with a 
'sell' recommendation and 700 pence target.
The US broker cited its expectations of falling copper prices in 2006, an increasing cost base driven by inflationary 
pressures in Kazakhstan, and the company's full valuation when compared with local and global mining stocks.
Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo American dropped 27 pence to 1,969, Antofagasta lost 23 pence to 1,887 and 
Xstrata fell 8 to 1,448.
A broker downgrade hurt Intercontinental Hotels, with the shares down 14-1/2 pence at 819. UBS cut its rating to 
'neutral' from 'buy' on valuation grounds.
Among the midcaps, Michael Page slipped 5-1/2 pence to 266-1/2 as an overall in-line set of fourth-quarter results 
was countered by some disappointment over the performance of the Asia-Pacific business.
On the retail front, JJB Sports shed 3-1/4 pence to 166-3/4 after the UK sports retailer issued a material profit 
warning with its update on the Christmas trading period.
JJB warned that for the year to Jan 29 2006, pretax profits are expected to come in at 32-36 mln stg. This is lower 
than the current market expectations of around 42 mln, noted Bridgewell.
Still in the retail arena, HMV jumped 4-1/2 pence to 191-1/2, helped by news it has been upgraded to 'hold' from 
'reduce' by ABN Amro on valuation grounds.
Finally, London Stock Exchange rose 5-1/2 pence to 620 after CSFB upgraded the shares to 'outperform' from 
'neutral' and hiked its target price to 700 pence from 625.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - European technology shares enjoyed robust gains in New York trading Friday, picking

overall Composite Index was 2.02 points higher, or 1.4%, to 141.76.

3.2% to $21.93. STMicroelectronics shares climbed as much as 3.8% to $19.73. Infineon Technologies shares 
advanced as much as 3.4% to $10.26.
U.S. IT consulting firm Accenture Ltd. contributed to positive tech sentiment after it reported first-quarter earnings 
above analysts' expectations Thursday.
'Overall, we believe Accenture's results should support positive sentiment toward the European software and IT

In the airline sector, Ryanair missed out on the day's gains, falling as much as 0.4% to $57.23 after Deutsche Bank 
downgraded the Irish low-cost carrier to sell from hold.
Air France-KLM rose almost 1% to $22.76 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the airline to hold from sell.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are tipped to kick the session a touch higher, mirroring a solid showing on Wall 
Street overnight, but gains could be capped with little in the way of corporate news to tempt investors in off the 
sidelines, dealers said.
Spread bettors CMC Markets, expect the FTSE 100 index to open 4 points firmer at around 5719 having closed 
yesterday up 3.1 points at 5,714.0.
Meanwhile, in the US, the S&P 500 set a four-and-a-half year closing high, after Fed remarks hinting at an end to 
interest-rate rises powered a second day in a row of gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 32.74 points higher at 10,880.15, while the Nasdaq rose 19.72 points to 
2,263.46.
And today investors will scrutinise the latest weekly jobless claims and December ISM services data to gauge the 
health of the world's biggest economy.
Investors expect new claims for state unemployment benefits to fall by 1000 to 321,000 for the week ending 
December 24.
In Asia overnight, the Nikkei 225 closed 63.83 to the good at 16,425.37, a five-year-high, while the Hang Seng 
started its afternoon session 126.86 firmer at 15,326.92.
And still in Asia, oil prices were slightly easier, marking time before the release of the weekly US stockpile figures 
and after the settlement of the gas pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine.
Earlier this morning, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in February, was down 0.07 usd at 
63.35 usd a barrel.
Back in London, on the economic front, the December services purchasing managers' index is expected to rise to 
56.0 from 55.8 the previous month.
In equities, with a lack of earnings on the calendar, traffic figures from blue chip airline British Airways and low frills 
peer Ryanair will garner attention.
London shares outlook - higher on solid Wall St but lack of news may cap gains
For November, the national carrier reported a 6.3 pct rise in passenger numbers compared to the same month the 
previous year.
On the second-line, Redrow will also be under the spotlight when the housebuilder updates investors on current 
trading.
The sector has been the subject of recent consolidation hopes following Persimmon's agreed bid for rival Westbury 
and talk Taylor Woodrow may merge with George Wimpey.
Market research group Taylor Nelson Sofres is also due to issue a trading update after saying at the interim stage it 
is on track to meet full year targets of 4 pct organic revenue growth and to increase its margins by 25-50 basis 
points.
Also penciled in to release a trading update is utility group Keller.
In broker news, Next will continue in the spotlight after JP Morgan upgraded the fashion retailer to 'neutral' vs 
'underweight' following a better-than-expected pre-Christmas trading update yesterday.
Amvescap could also notch up opening gains as Deutsche Bank turned buyer of the fundmanager this morning.

LONDON (AFX) - European exchanges are expected to move higher afer further gains on Wall St overnight as 
hopes of an imminent end to US rate hikes continued to lift the mood, dealers said.
Last night, the DJIA closed 32.74 points higher at 10,880.15, after triple digit gains on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq rose 19.72 points to 2,263.46.
In Asia, the Nikkei index closed up 63.83 points at 16,425.37 while the Hang Seng ended the morning up 126.86 
points at 15,326.92.
Crude prices moved back again ahead of US inventory data later.
At 0335 GMT, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in February, was down 0.07 usd at 63.35 
usd a barrel from 63.42 usd in New York, where it had risen 0.28 usd after an initial slide on news that Moscow and 
Kiev had settled their spat over gas pricing.
Corporate news remains thin on the ground and trade will be dominated by data and a few ongoing M&A stories.
Car groups will be in the spotlight after last night's US car sales data which showed BMW December sales fell 1.3 
pct, hit by a 11 pct fall in demand for its sport utility vehicles.
Chrysler sales declined 5 pct, while Mercedes-Benz sales increased 17 pct to 31,192, Porsche sales rose 4 pct -- 
helped by new 911 and Boxster models -- and Volkswagen sales rose 21 pct thanks to its new models.
Traffic figures from BA and Ryanair will also likely garner some interest.
Roche and GlaxoSmithKline could be hit after Procter & Gamble Co's pharmaceuticals unit and the US division of 
Sanofi-Aventis yesterday filed a lawsuit alleging false and misleading advertising regarding the prescription 
osteoporosis medication, Boniva.
Sanofi-Aventis SA and Procter & Gamble co-market the osteoporosis drug Actonel.
Meanwhile, BAE Systems has won two contracts to help build the UK's new Future Rapid Effect System vehicle, 
according to The Independent.
Euroshares outlook - higher after Wall St gains, news still thin on the ground
In Germany, the Suddeutsche Zeitung daily reported that newspaper publisher Axel Springer is prepared to sell 
more than 30 of its titles to appease the competition watchdog over its planned takeover of commercial television 
group ProSiebenSat.1.
ABN Amro Holdings NV will be in focus after its ABN Amro Mortgage Group Inc unit agreed to pay the US 41 mln 
usd to settle charges it improperly handled loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, the Justice 
Department said yesterday.
Prosecutors said the division of ABN Amro made false certifications to federal authorities in connection with 28,097 
US government-insured mortgages.
And Total may well win some attention as French magazine Challenges says the group is planning to split the role 
of its Chief Executive and chairman. Thierry Desmarest currently holds both roles.
On the economic front, Euro area December PMI should see a further increase on the back of more upbeat 
sentiment elsewhere. The PPI and retail sales data for November are also due.
The UK CIPS services PMI for December is expected to show continued stability and be consistent with good 
service sector growth, dealers said. Weekly jobless claims, oil inventory data ISM Non-Manufacturing Index are 
also due.

PARIS (AFX) - Shares were lower at midday as profit-taking eroded yesterday's surge, but Gaz de France was 
rebounding from sharp losses as regulators sparked new hopes for an upward bump in the operating profit of a key 
business, dealers said.
The CAC-40 index was down 5.90 points or 0.12 pct at 4,746.51.
Volume was light at 847 mln eur.
Matif January CAC-40 futures were down 7.5 points or 0.16 pct at 4,757.50.
The euro was quoted at 1.1822 usd, against 1.1867 early today.
Vivendi was down 0.24 eur or 0.91 pct at 26.27, after denying a UK press report that it is interested in acquiring SCI 
Entertainment.
Carrefour was down 0.32 eur or 0.80 pct at 39.68, after launching a bid for the remainder of its Hyparlo affiliate.
Sanofi-Aventis was down 0.15 eur or 0.20 pct at 75.40, after saying it will broaden its cooperation with Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals in a move involving a 25 mln usd payment.
Arcelor was down 0.06 eur or 0.29 pct at 20.93, as a decision is awaited on whether it will raise its offer for

BNP Paribas was down 0.35 eur or 0.51 pct at 67.90 after a tie-up with Axa involving small reciprocal stakes. Axa

Among other gainers, Gaz de France showed the strongest rise in the CAC-40, up 0.73 eur or 2.97 pct at 25.35. It

that business in 2006-07.

The five new aircraft to be based in Dublin represent an investment of over 300 mln usd.

Boeing jet delays to sap Ryanair growth in early '06

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) -- Fast-growing European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings said Tuesday that the late 
delivery of four Boeing Co. jetliners due to a strike will rein in its growth during early 2006.
During January, February and March, Ryanair plans to pare its flight schedule and accordingly expects about 
100,000 fewer passengers each month.
It's one of the quieter periods for the airline, said spokesman Peter Sherrard, with lower bookings typically seen 
during January and February.
For travelers with cancelled flights, they will be given a refund or new tickets, the company said.
Ryanair's also retiring older 737-200s at the end of the month to make way for the newer planes. Those older 737s 
have been sold and their pilots retrained, according to the carrier.
The last of the 737-800s planes will be delivered in April.
But Ryanair said that it's changing its earnings outlook for the fiscal year ending March 31. The carrier expects to 
report lower passenger traffic for the year, at 34.7 million people.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing stock advanced 1.1% to $70.73, while Nasdaq-traded shares of Ryanair 
were fractionally higher.
The nearly month-long strike in September by Boeing's machinists on its commercial aircraft lines cost the company 
some $1.5 billion in revenue and hurt margins, executives said in October after the company's quarterly report.
Ryanair's contracts for the jets don't carry any financial penalties for strike actions, said Sherrard.
Ireland's Ryanair is the leading low-cost operator in Europe.
It's profitable despite surging fuel costs. The company's goal is to double its passenger volume and earnings by 
2012.

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - Sharp losses among technology and pharmaceutical shares, as well as a lagging Wall 
Street took their toll on European shares trading in the U.S. Tuesday.
The Bank of New York American Depositary Receipt Index was last down 0.41 point to 133.95 and the overall 
Composite Index was 0.10 point lower to 134.14.
In New York, U.S. stocks turned higher in early afternoon trade Tuesday, but gains were slender and strategists 
suggested the year-end rally has run its course. .
Semiconductor stocks were trading lower after a brokerage Monday downgraded Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , 
Texas Instruments Inc. and four other stocks, saying their prices already reflect most of the industry's strengths.
Reflecting weakness in the sector, shares of StMicroelectronics fell as much as 28 cents, or 1.5%, to $18.08. 
Shares of Infineon Technologies lost almost 1% to $9.21. ASM International shares dropped as much as 28 cents, 
or 1.9%, to $14.45.
Europe's biggest pharmaceutical companies suffered sharp losses. Shares of volume-leader Elan Corp. lost as 
much as 31 cents, or 2.3% to $12.94. Novartis shares declined as much as 1.1% to $52.05. AstraZeneca shares 
stumbled as much as 57 cents, or 1.1% to $48.93.
In corporate news, shares of Britain's Lloyds TSB slipped 0.03% to $34.33 after Morgan Stanley agreed to buy 
some of its credit-card operations for $1.76 billion.
Bank of Ireland shares lost as much as 92 cents, or 1.4%, to $64.07 following a deal to buy 71.5% of Guggenheim 
Alternative Asset Management, a fund of hedge funds manager, for $184 million in cash.
Among the afternoon's few advancers, shares of no-frills carrier Ryanair rose as much as $1.25, or 2.2%, to $57.10. 
With over 50 players, the European low-cost airline sector is set for a shake-up but analysts believed that Ireland-
based Ryanair is one of the few carriers that will survive.
Meanwhile, shares of Air France-KLM fell as much as 2.3% to $21.05 and British Airways slid 0.4% to $59.25.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based airline, said the late delivery of planes ordered from 
Boeing will mean it will carry 300,000 fewer passengers in the year to end-March 2006 than it previously 
anticipated.
The no-frills airline is now forecasting current year passenger traffic of 'just under' 35 mln.
To accommodate a month delay in the Boeing orders, the no-frills carrier has put back the introduction of additional 
aircraft at Nottingham East Midlands and Pisa airports by two months to early April and announced a consequent 1 
pct reduction in its flying programme for January, February and March.
The move also reflects Ryanair's decision to retire the existing fleet of 737-200's on schedule at the end of 
December.
Ryanair said the changes will not effect its guidance for the year to March 31 2006 for a net profit of 295 mln eur, up 
10 pct on the previous year.
At 10.57 am, shares in the airline were down 0.1 eur at 7.75.

KUALA LUMPUR (AFX) - Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia Bhd on Sunday urged ASEAN countries to speed up 
deregulation in the aviation industry, saying such a move would lower costs and spur growth.
Chief executive Tony Fernandes said the 10-nation bloc had to harmonize regulatory requirements if it wanted to 
achieve the goal of a common market with open skies, and called for a European-style joint aviation authority.
'If you look at Europe, if Irish carrier Ryanair has a problem with an aircraft in France, they can deploy another 
plane from London. But I can't do that here,' Fernandes told reporters.
'Engineers from one country can sign documents to certify an aircraft was air-worthy in another country. This is cost 
saving for the company,' he said.
'I am sure that goes across all other industries. For us to have a common market, we must have a common 
standard across the industry. Otherwise the cost of business will go up for us,' he said.
Fernandes said AirAsia was already talking with authorities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand where it already 
has business units to map out a common standard in the industry.
ASEAN hopes to establish a common market by 2020.
The Malaysia-based airline has ordered 100 new Airbus A320 planes, due to start arriving this month, which are 
expected to make AirAsia the largest budget carrier in Asia by 2011.

STOCKWATCH BAA lower following Nov traffic numbers, Heathrow strike threat

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in BAA were lower in early trade following the release of passenger figures for November 
and news that construction work at its new fifth terminal at Heathrow airport is set to grind to a halt for four days 
next week after members of two leading unions voted to strike over bonus payments.
At 8.50 am, shares in BAA were 4 pence lower at 643 while the FTSE 100 was 8.7 points easier at 5522.4.
Earlier, BAA said passenger numbers at its seven airports grew last month despite a sharp fall in demand for 
charter flights.
The group saw a 2.2 pct rise in passenger traffic in November to 10.4 mln although it saw a 19.8 pct drop in 
European chartered traffic.
European schedule traffic was up 2.3 pct and Irish traffic grew 8.8 pct. A weaker economy and some passengers 
choosing to take improved train services between London and Manchester and Liverpool impacted on the UK 
domestic market which grew just 0.6 pct, the group said.
Since the start of the financial year, BAA airports have handled 102.5 mln passengers - up 2.4 pct on the April to 
November figure for 2004.
It said the continued popularity of low-cost airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair resulted in the number of European 
charter flights being cut while passenger numbers on long haul flights grew 8.4 pct - partly because of 22 new 
services operated by Virgin, BA and British Midland linking Heathrow with India.
In response to the numbersm, Panmure Gordon said BAA's figures had been weak for a number of months and 
weren't meeting its 3 pct target. The broker said it was maintaining its 'sell' rating and 560 pence price target.
In other news, construction work on BAA PLC's new fifth terminal at Heathrow airport is set to grind to a halt for four 
days next week after members of two leading unions voted to strike over bonus payments.
The T&G and GMB, together representing around 600 of the project's 1,500-strong workforce, said their members 
will walk out on Friday morning.

The dispute follows the unions' failure to secure a review of constructor Laing O'Rourke's bonus scheme. That has 
seen payments frozen for the past three years.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares remained in the red in midafternoon deals as an uninspiring start to Wall Street 
added to weakness in BP after a major sell-off by the Kuwaiti Government in the oil major, dealers said.
By 3.00 pm, the FTSE 100 index was down 13.1 points at 5,518, but off a low of 5504.4, in contrast to a positive 
wider market.
Volumes were moderate, with 1.8 bln shares changing hands in 190,071 deals.
Meanwhile, in New York, shares were flat at open as better-than-expected consumer confidence data was offset by 
disappointment over Intel's quarterly update and a hike in the price of crude.
Within the first thirty minutes of trade, the DJIA was off 3.40 points higher at 10,751.
Back in London, oil heavyweights weighed on blue chips, led lower by BP, on news the Kuwaiti government is 
selling 185 mln shares in the group via an accelerated book-build at a price range of 645-652 pence, according to 
dealers.
This offset a spike in the price of crude as a cold snap across much of the US continued to raise concerns about 
winter heating-fuel supplies.
Crude for January delivery was last trading up 36 cents at 61.02 usd a barrel, having earlier risen to a five-week 
high of 61.50 as the cold weather offset a rise in inventories in the latest week.
BP was off 9-1/2 at 641-1/2, Royal Dutch Shell lost 29 pence to 1886.
Compass Group also remained lower, down 2-1/2 pence at 211-1/2 on reports that the catering group is facing 
further legal woes.
According to the Financial Times, a US congressional committee has called for a further investigation into 
allegations that Compass was involved in corrupt buying practices with the UN.
The decision, the paper said, dashes Compass's hopes of bringing the multiple legal probes it is facing to a swift 
end.

Elsewhere, AB Foods dropped 5 pence to 827 after an uninspiring trading update from the food manufacturer.
The food manufacturer said trading in the current year is slightly ahead of last year's level and it remains on track to 
post modest full-year earnings growth though high energy prices remain a source of concern.
BAA was also under the cosh, off 1 pence to 646-1/2, following the release of passenger figures for November and 
amid news of strike action at Terminal Five at Heathrow.
Sentiment in the stock was further hit as the airport operator's announcement that it has cut the projected cost of a 
second runway at Stansted Airport by almost 30 pct to 2.7 bln stg was branded as 'folly' by its customers
Ryanair and easyJet.
On the upside, PartyGaming topped the FTSE 100 risers once again as brokers continued to heap praise on 
yesterday's upbeat trading statement.
Morgan Stanley repeated its 'overweight' recommendation, raised its EPS forecasts by 10 pct for 2006 and 8 pct for 
2007 and hiked its target price to 150 pence from 130.
Deutsche Bank also repeated its 'buy' recommendation and hiked its target to 160 pence from 155, arguing that the 
benefits of moving towards a multi-product platform with a shared purse will continue to filter through in 2006.
Shares gained a further 5-3/4 pence at 142.
Bullish broker comment also boosted WPP shares 18-1/2 pence higher to 611. UBS repeated its 'buy' rating and 
raised its price target on the advertising giant to 700 pence from 660 as it expects strong advertising momentum to 
continue in 2006, boosted by the football World Cup in Germany.
UK-listed miners were also in demand, bouncing back from yesterday's sell off, as gold rallied to 24-1/2 year highs.
Anglo American was 34 pence higher at 1,897, BHP Billiton added 7 pence to 896-1/2, and Xstrata gained 19 
pence to 1,380
Antofagasta meanwhile was unchanged at 1,741 after Merrill raised its rating on the group to 'neutral' from 'sell' on 
the back of hikes to copper price forecasts.
Elsewhere, Yell added 6-3/4 pence to 503, lifted by upbeat comments ahead of an investor seminar in the US.
The group said it is on track to meet fiscal-year expectations as its US online service, Yellowbook.com, produced 
sales of 17.9 mln usd in the six months to September 30.
Retailers were also in demand amid hopes of a bumper Christmas with GUS 32-1/2 higher at 968, Marks & 
Spencer took on 7-1/4 at 479-1/2, Next edged up 20 at 1520 and Tesco added 6 at 325.
Among the midcap risers, Bradford & Bingley moved up 17-1/2 pence to 401-1/4 on news that mortgage lender 
expects pretax profits for the full year to come in 'comfortably' ahead of analysts' forecasts.
Analysts however, advised selling into strength, with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein downgrading the shares to 
'reduce' from 'hold', reminding clients that the shares were the top performing UK bank in 2005 and now trade 6 pct 
above its 360 pence target, supported by bid speculation.
And Skyepharma, which yesterday announced it has had interest from several parties interested in purchasing the 
group, added another 1-1/4 pence to 52-1/2.
