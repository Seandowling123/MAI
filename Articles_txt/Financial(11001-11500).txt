IAG, owner of British Airways, filed a complaint to the European Commission yesterday over concerns that a rescue 
of Flybe breached state aid rules, as the UK government faced a backlash against its deal to support the regional 
airline.
Meanwhile Ryanair has written to Sajid Javid, UK chancellor, warning him that any move to help Flybe by cutting air 
passenger duty for domestic flights - and not international ones - would "constitute unlawful state aid" to the airlines 
operating those routes.
On Tuesday the government agreed a multipronged rescue package for the carrier including a short-term deferral of 
some of Flybe's APD - which costs the airline about £106m a year - and a potential government loan.
The government has pledged to review APD for UK carriers to see if it could improve regional connections without 
breaching climate targets.
A growing list of carriers have lined up to criticise the use of taxpayer funds to save their rival.
Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, blasted ministers' support for Flybe as a "blatant misuse of public funds", saying 
taxpayers were picking up the bill for mismanagement of the airline.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said: "Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies, 
especially when they are backed by well-funded businesses."

Mr Walsh noted that one of Flybe's owners was Virgin Atlantic, which is part-owned by one of the biggest US 
airlines, Delta.
In its letter to the chancellor, Ryanair referred to a case in 2011 in which the Irish government was forced by the 
European Commission to change its air travel tax arrangement, which offered lower rates for domestic flights.
The UK must follow EU state aid rules after Brexit at least until the end of the year.
Downing Street said: "The government is fully complying with state aid rules."

THE GOVERNMENT has found itself embroiled in a row over state aid, after its decision to save struggling regional 
airline Flybe sparked a series of complaints from rival carriers.
British Airways (BA) owner International Airlines Group (IAG) yesterday filed an official complaint to the European 
Commission, after its boss Willie Walsh castigated the government for deferring Flybe's tax bill as part of a rescue 
package.
The deal is also thought to include a £100m loan, as well as up to £30m in contributions from its shareholders. IAG 
said this contravened EU state aid rules because taxpayers would be subsidising an airline that competes directly 
on BA routes.
One of Flybe's biggest investors is Virgin Atlantic, a major BA rival.
In a letter to transport secretary Grant Shapps on Tuesday, Walsh wrote that Flybe's owners "want the taxpayer to 
pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline".
"This is a blatant misuse of public funds," he said.
Walsh was joined by Ryanair and Easyjet in opposing the plan. A Ryanair spokesperson said: "We have already 
called for more robust and frequent stress tests on financially weak airlines so the taxpayer does not have to bail 
them out." Johan Lundgren, chief executive of Easyjet, added: "We do not support state funding of carriers."
BACKLASH OVER STATE AID GAMBLE
Ministers said they would review the existing air passenger duty (APD) rules - the tax on flights taking off from the 
UK. However, this drew criticism from railway bosses, who said the move would encourage more people to travel 
on planes, rather than use less polluting trains.
The Rail Delivery Group, a trade body, said rail was "one of the greenest ways to travel and any review of APD that 
encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis".
Downing Street insisted it remains committed to free market economics, with any funding given to the airline on "a 
strictly commercial basis".
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy added that the 
government "has not given any state aid to Flybe".
The European Commission said: "We stand ready to discuss with the UK the compatibility and proposed public 
measures with the EU state aid rules. Any state aid intervention needs to be designed so that competition is not 
distorted."

YES ROB BURGESS Sitting in London, it is easy to think that Flybe should be allowed to fail. Sit in the departure 
hall at Exeter Airport, or Southampton, or one of the other regional hubs where Flybe represents over 75 per cent of 
traffic, and you may see it differently.
If the airline goes, the airports go. Easyjet, Ryanair and Jet2 have no interest in operating 78-seat Dash-8 aircraft. 
Eastern and Loganair are too small and financially weak to pick up the slack.
Changing the air passenger duty rules to exempt the return leg of domestic flights would help Flybe get back on its 
feet, although of course the Virgin consortium can't have a free ride. Freed from PLC pressures to show constant 
growth, it is taking an axe to unprofitable routes, and its few large jet aircraft are leaving the fleet. The Virgin 
rebrand, connecting traffic from Virgin Atlantic and integration into Virgin Flying Club should generate new revenue.
Real progress needs to be seen this summer, but it is right to give the airline time now.
£ Rob Burgess is editor of www.headforpoints.com, the UK's biggest frequent flyer            www.website.NO CARYS 
ROBERTS The government's rescue package for Flybe flies in the face of its own promises to make the UK the 
"cleanest, greenest" country on Earth. Domestic flights are the most polluting way to travel - for every kilometre 
travelled, domestic flights produce more than three times the emissions of rail, or 22 times the emissions of the 
Eurostar. Any cut to air passenger duty would boost demand for these polluting flights.
Other airlines and rail companies are asking why Flybe should get a special bailout. Domestic air travel already 
benefits from no taxes on fuel, and the zero-rating of tickets for VAT.
Was the government right to sign off a bailout for the airline Flybe ? DEBATE
Meanwhile, other countries are moving in the opposite direction: France is even considering banning all domestic 
flights where a train journey could be made in under five hours.
Connecting the regions of the UK is vital for economic growth that is fairly shared. But to do this the government 
should be investing in rail rather than propping up uncompetitive, carbonintensive businesses.

Jan 16, 2020( Financial Buzz: http://www.financialbuzz.com Delivered by Newstex)  Corporación Amrica Airports 
S.A. (NYSE: CAAP), ('CAAP' or the 'Company') the largest private sector airport operator in the world by number of 
airports, reported today preliminary year-over-year passenger traffic growth of 2.1% in December 2019.Passenger 
Traffic Overview Total passenger traffic in December 2019 grew by 2.1% YoY, primarily reflecting increases of 
3.0% in Argentina, 8.8% in Italy, 7.5% in Ecuador and 6.1% in Armenia, partially offset by declines in Brazil and 
Uruguay. In Argentina, total passenger traffic increased 3.0% YoY, driven by 6.4% growth in domestic passengers 
mainly due to new routes introduced during 2018 and 2019, together with a mix-shift to domestic from international 
travel by local passengers. International passenger traffic declined 4.4%, still reflecting weak macro conditions in 
the country. 
Additionally, Aerolineas Argentinas started a new route to Orlando, USA, and low-cost carrier Flybondi added a new 
route from El Palomar to Florianopolis, Brazil. In Italy, passenger traffic increased 8.8% YoY, driven mainly by 
19.5% growth at Florence Airport which reported a 22.1% increase in international traffic as a result of Vueling's 
four new routes opened in September and additional frequencies in its existing routes. Moreover, passenger traffic 
at Pisa Airport increased 3.5% YoY, reflecting additional flights by Ryanair, and, to a lesser extent, the good 
performance of Air Arabia's flights to Casablanca, Morocco. In Brazil, estimated figures are disclosed given delays 
in the submission of information for 280 flights out of a total of 14,541 flights, due to information systems transition 
by third parties. Total passenger traffic declined 4.7% YoY, still reflecting the cessation of operations by Avianca 
Brasil, partially offset by traffic growth driven by other airlines. Domestic passenger traffic declined 2.6% YoY, while 
international passenger traffic increased 2.8% YoY. In addition, Latam Airlines started a new daily route to 
Asunción, Paraguay from Brasilia Airport, while Azul Airlines added new frequencies to Recife and Campinas, 
operated from Natal Airport. In Armenia, total passenger traffic increased 6.1%, benefiting from the addition of 
several routes and frequencies during 2018 and 2019 and higher connectivity to Moscow, Russia, coupled with the 
good performance of Azimuth Airlines' flights to Russian destinations Krasnodar and Rostov, Aircompany Armenia's 
flights to regional destinations, as well as SkyUp Airlines' route to Kiev, Ukraine. In Uruguay, passenger traffic 
declined 2.3% YoY, mainly reflecting the temporary cancellation of Avianca Colombia's daily route to Bogot, 
Colombia, that was restored by the end of December. Traffic also reflects the cancellation of Sky's route to 
Santiago de Chile since April 2019, which was temporarily reinstated by the end of December 2019 to operate 
Corporacin Amrica Airports S.A. Reports a 2.1% YoY Increase in Total Passenger Traffic in December 2019
during the summer season. This was partially offset by the two additional frequencies to Madrid, Spain, opened by 
Iberia in July 2019 and additional flights from Ezeiza Airport, in Argentina. In Ecuador, total passenger traffic 
increased 7.5% YoY, driven by a 16.1% increase in international traffic, mainly reflecting the continued good 
performance of the route to Fort Lauderdale by JetBlue and Interjet's daily routes to both Cancún and Ciudad de 
Mxico, Mxico, together with Iberia's new route to Madrid, Spain, opened in December with four weekly frequencies. 
In addition, during the month, JetBlue opened a new daily route to New York, USA, and American Airlines 
inaugurated a new route to Dallas, with daily frequencies. This more than offset the cancelation in December of 
Latam's route to Madrid, Spain. Cargo Volume and Aircraft Movements Cargo volume declined 5.4% in December 
2019, mainly as a result of declines of 15.5% in Argentina and 25.2% in Ecuador, partially offset by a 28.3% 
increase in Brazil.Aircraft movements declined 3.5% YoY in December 2019, driven by declines of 6.1% in 
Argentina and 6.7% in Brazil, partially offset by an increase of 8.8% in Italy.To obtain the full text of this press

The Most Expensive Airline Strikes of 2019
The Most Expensive Airline Strikes of 2019

Another year has been marked with several airline strikes that cost the aviation industry billions of 
dollars. Eurowings Cabin crew even welcomed the New Year with a strike that ran from December 30 to January 1.
As a result of a strike, airlines are liable for flight compensation.
The following list was made by GIVT to get a better understanding of just how large the scope of air passenger 
compensation was in 2019.
British Airways has a streak of bad luck throughout 2019. August and November saw hundreds of flight 
cancellations after experiencing expensive "IT glitches." This was followed by members of the British Airline Pilots' 
Association striking over their pay, causing 2,325 flights to be canceled.
This strike cost the airline (EURO)137 million ($152,858,435.00). Even a rumor or a proposed strike can cost an 
airline millions. A strike in Heathrow was canceled before it even began, yet set British Airways back another 
(EURO)33 million ($36,816,285.00).
Nationwide strikes have not been doing any favors for the struggling Alitalia. Alitalia had to cancel hundreds of 
flights during Italy's national transport strike from July 24-26, with the prospect of more strikes still to come. 
Meanwhile, Iberia has also had a difficult year. The summer saw issues between management and staff, with 
canceled flights up 40% and delayed flights doubling on average in July and August alone.
Lufthansa had to cancel 1,300 flights in November due to a two-day strike over pay rates and conditions. To 
compensate the 180,000 affected, Lufthansa offered train tickets to passengers traveling between German airports 
and alternative flights to other passengers.
Norwegian Air had pilots in Norway, Sweden and Denmark strike over fears of all operations being moved to the UK 
after the airline set up UK base of operations. In addition, Norwegian cabin crew members at Paris' Charles de 
Gaulle airport issued strike warnings in April for increased pay and improved work conditions. The April strike did 
not come to fruition, but new strikes are scheduled from October 2019 - January 2020.
Mavericks Ryanair faced controversy amongst their pilots and cabin crew in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, 
Spain and Portugal in 2019. However, due to Ryanair's policy of employing other strike-breaking crews from other 
The Most Expensive Airline Strikes of 2019
countries, the strike had little impact on service for customers. Ryanair customers would experience an increase in 
delays in January, February, April and August and an increase of cancellations in January, Ryanair's overall 
cancellations for 2019 were 70% less than in 2018.
Scandinavian Air Services (SAS) was not as lucky, as a 6-day pilot strike in April cause 4,015 flights to be canceled. 
With an estimated 360,000 passengers affected, the potential compensation could cost up to (EURO)90 million 
($100,408,050.00).

Jan 15, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  British Airways-
parent IAG on Wednesday filed a formal complaint to Brussels over the UK government's last-minute financial 
rescue of struggling no-frills carrier Flybe."IAG has submitted a complaint to the EU Competition directorate this 
morning about the state aid that the UK government has granted to Flybe," the group said in a statement.The 
European Commission confirmed receipt of IAG's submission, having said earlier that it "stood ready" to discuss 
with London the compatability of the proposed Flybe measures with EU state aid rules.British Conservative Prime 
Minister Boris Johnson's government agreed late Tuesday to review air passenger duty (APD) paid by the Flybe's 
customers, while its shareholders pledged extra investment.However, neither the government nor Flybe disclosed 
financial details of the rescue agreement.IAG chief executive Willie Walsh had already reacted with fury to the 
news, labelling it a "misuse of public funds". Employing some 2,000 people, Flybe has failed to turn around its 
fortunes since it was purchased a year ago by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic. The Connect Airways consortium 
-- which also comprises investment firm Cyrus and infrastructure specialist Stobart -- has seen Flybe struggle owing 
to weak demand and fierce competition.Virgin and its largest shareholder, US airline Delta, "want the taxpayer to 
pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline", Walsh said in a statement."This is a blatant misuse of public 
funds," added Walsh, who is soon to step down as head of IAG.British low-cost airline Easyjet voiced its concern at 
the lack of detail."We do not support state funding of carriers but without the detail of what is exactly proposed, it is 
hard to comment further," said Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren. 
Competitors are not happy about the UK government rescue of Flybe Photo: AFP / INA FASSBENDER "Having 
said that, what is clear is that taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies especially when they 
are backed by well-funded businesses."Ireland's Ryanair argued that airlines should be stress-tested -- and 
repeated its desire for the UK government to scrap APD entirely."We have already called for more robust and 
frequent stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out," 
a Ryanair spokesperson said."We have also repeatedly called on the UK government to abolish Air Passenger Duty 
to allow tourism and jobs to grow and ensure airports can compete and attract more business. Reducing APD 
doesn't go far enough."Flybe, which claims it has been weakened also by uncertainties related to Brexit, carries 
around eight million passengers annually and flies from 43 airports across Europe and 28 in Britain.The carrier is 
the biggest operator of UK domestic flights but small UK airlines like Flybe have suffered recently from volatile fuel 
costs and a weak pound.The Flybe rescue stands in stark contrast to the fate of British holiday giant Thomas Cook, 
which collapsed without government assistance last September.That caused the loss of 22,000 jobs worldwide and 
stranded 600,000 holidaymakers abroad.Independent air transport consultant John Strickland argued that Johnson 
British Airways-owner Files EU Complaint Over Flybe Rescue
was keen to boost his credentials in areas largely outside of London that are served by Flybe."We have a new 
government keen to establish its credentials in the UK regions and Flybe is a key regional player," Strickland told 
AFP."That said, the airline has struggled financially under a number of managements for several years and suffers 
from over-ambitious ordering of aircraft... The airline should logically be smaller than it is."He added: "Other airlines 
are incensed at government intervention."

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ba-owner-leads-the-complaints-with-eu-over-taxpayers-flybe-rescue/The 
parent firm of British Airways has lodged a complaint with the European Union over the UK government's support 
that is enabling Flybe to keep flying.International Airlines Group (IAG) confirmed the move hours after an angry 
statement from its chief executive Willie Walsh declared the rescue a 'blatant misuse of public cash'. After it was 
revealed on Sunday night that the regional airline was in frantic talks to avert collapse, ministers announced on 
Tuesday evening that an agreement had been struck to safeguard its immediate future. The terms included the 
deferral of Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments, amounting to more than 100m, in return for the independent 
airline's major shareholders injecting tens of millions in new funds. 
The measures, to date, mean 2,400 jobs at Flybe are safe - for now. But no additional details have been released 
and the government is understood to still be negotiating a loan on commercial terms with the airline, casting 
continuing doubt on its long-term future. The bailout reflects the seriousness of how ministers view the threat to UK 
transport connectivity should Flybe, which focuses its operations on domestic regional airports, fall. While 
explaining the reasons for the aid, the Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said Flybe was a 'viable' company. IAG 
was yet to provide details of its complaint to Brussels but it is likely to be based on the belief the bailout constitutes 
illegal state aid, under EU law. In an earlier letter to the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Mr Walsh wrote: 'Prior 
to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its 
operations by subsidising regional routes. 'Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their 
mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds. 'Flybe's precarious situation makes a 
mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional 
flights if a third runway is built.' Ryanair said of the rescue: 'We have already called for more robust and frequent 
stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out.' 
Environmental campaigners also criticised the deal, particularly over the deferral of APD, and urged Mr Shapps to 
boost rail travel following the government's review of regional connectivity and domestic APD levels. Friends of the 
Earth aviation campaigner, Jenny Bates, said: 'Any review of APD that leads to cheaper air travel and more 
polluting flights, would be a complete scandal - and rip apart Boris Johnson's pledge to show leadership on the 
climate crisis.' Greenpeace UK policy director, Dr Doug Parr, demanded APD remained when he said: 'The 
government cannot claim to be a global leader on tackling the climate emergency one day, then making the most 
BA owner leads the complaints with EU over taxpayers' Flybe rescue
carbon-intensive kind of travel cheaper the next. The Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom explains why Flybe was 
given taxpayer aid while others have been refused financial help.'Cutting the cost of domestic flights while allowing 
train fares to rise is the exact opposite of what we need if we're to cut climate-wrecking emissions from transport.' 
Chancellor Sajid Javid said of the deal on Tuesday: 'I welcome Flybe's confirmation that they will continue to 
operate as normal, safeguarding jobs in UK and ensuring flights continue to serve communities across the whole of 
the UK. 'The reviews we are announcing today will help level up our economy. 'They will ensure that regional 
connections not only continue but flourish in the years to come - so that every nation and region can fulfil its 
potential.' Read more: BA owner leads the complaints with EU over taxpayers' Flybe rescue[1] [ 1]:

Ryanair could receive its first deliveries of up to 10 grounded 737 MAX aircraft from Boeing by April, Chief 
Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said on Tuesday, but cautioned the timing was dependent on regulators.
That is earlier than indicated by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary this month when he said the airline might not receive 
its first 737 MAX until October.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft, has not flown since last March following two crashes which claimed 
346 lives. Ryanair has up to 210 of the planes on order, but none in service.
"We now think we will get it in March or April this year, looks more like April than March, and we think we will get up 
to 10 MAX aircraft," Jacobs told a news conference in Madrid.
"It could still mean less than ten and the date could still change ... It has been a moving feast and the dates have 
slipped up to now for the past months," Jacobs said, adding all European airlines' orders were in the hands of 
regulators.
"We still think the MAX is a great aircraft. Our focus, their (Boeing's) focus now is just to get the MAX flying."
Ryanair last month cut its passenger traffic forecast for the year to March 31, 2021, to 156 million from 157 million 
after scrapping some planned summer operations due to the MAX delays.
That forecast was based on Ryanair receiving 10 MAX aircraft in time for the summer season. It previously cut 
expectations to 20 from the 60 originally scheduled.

However, the airline has also since raised its profit forecast for the year to the end of March 2020 after a better-
than-expected performance over Christmas and New Year. (Reuters)

RITISH bluechips shed early gains last Friday as a slide in banks overshadowed a rise in airlines amid fears of a 
rate cut.
Both the benchmarks missed out on a Wall Street frenzy that took all three US indexes to all-time highs despite 
weak jobs data for December.
The FTSE 100 ended 0.1 per cent lower after trading most of the session in positive territory.
An index of bank stocks gave up one per cent led by a 2.5 per cent drop in Lloyds, after Bank of England 
policymaker Silvana Tenreyro joined the central bank's head Mark Carney in leaning towards lowering interest 
rates.
But a near five per cent gain for British Airways owner IAG and a 4.2 per cent rise in Easyjet limited losses.
Irish carrier Ryanair's Londonlisted shares jumped six per cent to their highest since June 2018 after reporting a 
better-than-expected performance during the Christmas and New Year travel period.
The FTSE 250 dipped 0.4 per cent to its lowest in over three weeks, with retailer B&M falling six per cent on slowing 
sales growth in the Christmas quarter and Watches of Switzerland losing four per cent following a discounted share 
sale.
Aston Martin outshone the index, leaping 15.3 per cent after a report that China's Geely was in talks about taking a 
stake.
Once again, most retailers came under pressure.
Bluechips lose value on banks in rate cut fears; LONDON REPORT
Superdry slipped seven per cent to its lowest in over a year as sales during the peak holiday period fell short of its 
expectations. Joules Group tanked 21 per cent to a life low after a profit warning due to a shortage of merchandise 
during the Christmas period.
It has been a rollercoaster ride for the retail sector as companies issue updates on holiday trading.
Morrisons and Tesco gave betterthan-feared numbers, but Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have not matched up 
to market expectations, which led to a share slump in both stocks this week.

Jan 13, 2020( 24/7 Wall St.: http://www.247wallst.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Stocks have been putting in new all-
time highs at the start of 2020 after an incredibly strong 2019. The futures were indicated higher on Monday 
morning ahead of this week's top bank earnings reports. For the investors who have not made portfolio shifts and 
changes during a very strong market in 2019, there is still time to get positioned for 2020. There are many market 
risks, concerns and headlines that may come with worry, but trade tensions are abating and global growth may see 
a rekindled strength this year, while interest rates are expected to remain stable. This is also an election year in 
which much is at stake, and strategists are by and large calling for single-digit percentage gains in 2020. 24/7 Wall 
St. 
reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week with a goal of finding new ideas for traders and 
long-term investors alike. Some of the daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy, while some calls cover stocks to sell 
or to avoid. We have provided these analyst calls in a quick-hit summary for easy reading, and additional comments 
and trading data have been added on many calls. The consensus analyst price targets and other valuation metrics 
are from the Refinitiv sell-side research service. Our 2020 Bull/Bear Outlook[1] sees the Dow rising by about 7.4% 
to 30,650 this year, but there are outliers that could help the Dow rise by over 10% after a very strong 2019. The 
upside scenario puts Dow 32,000[2] easily within reach if only a few things go right this year. These are the top 
analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations from Monday, January 13, 2020. Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE: 
AAP) was removed from the Best Ideas List at Wedbush Securities due to the firm's investment price parameters. 
Its shares closed down 2.5% at $149.01 on Friday and were indicated down another 2.9% at $145.00 on Monday, 
in a 52-week trading range of $130.09 to $182.56. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) was reiterated 
as Outperform with a $149 price target (versus a $110.74 prior close) at Wedbush, with the firm noting that the 
company pre-announced a beat for 2019 on the top line and said that its Ultomiris continues to gain traction and 
expectation that it will see a continued growth potential. Alliant Energy Corp. (NASDA: LNT) was reiterated as Buy 
and the target price was raised to $60 from $57 at Argus. American Tower Corp. (NYSE: AMT) was raised to Buy 
from Neutral and the target price was raised to $270 from $204 (versus a $230.80 close) at Goldman Sachs. 
American Water Works Co. Inc. (NYSE: AWK) was maintained as Underperform but the price objective was raised 
Top Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades: Alexion, American Water Works, Apple, Schwab, Crowdstrike, FedEx, 
IBM, Microsoft, Nvidia, Ryanair, Tesla and More
to $128 from $125 at Merrill Lynch. Shares previously closed at $122.56 and had a consensus target price of 
$126.91. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was reiterated as Buy and its target price was raised to $375 from $300 at 
D.A. Davidson. Apollo Global Management Inc. (NYSE: APO) was downgraded to Market Perform from Market 
Outperform at JMP Securities, but another call out of Merrill Lynch raised the target price to $155 from $152. The 
stock closed at $49.87 ahead of the calls, with a $50.25 consensus target price. Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: 
SCHW) was reiterated as Neutral and the price objective was raised to $51 from $50 (versus a $47.80 close) at 
Merrill Lynch. The consensus target price is $53.50, and the 52-week range is $34.58 to $51.65. Crowdstrike 
Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) was named as the Bull of the Day at Zacks, which said that cybersecurity threats 
will become global warfare this decade and one cloud falcon is winning the hearts and minds. Shares most recently 
closed at $57.20, with a consensus price target of $78.00. DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) was raised to Neutral from 
Underperform and the target price was raised to $132 from $125 at Credit Suisse, with the firm noting its shares are 
now a better bargain. Duke Energy Corp. (NYSE: DUK) was maintained as Underperform and the price objective 
was raised to $96 from $95 at Merrill Lynch. Shares closed at $90.44 and have a consensus target price of $96.00.

Ryanair boosts 2020 outlook after Christmas travel upturn
Ryanair boosts 2020 outlook after Christmas travel upturn

Ryanair has raised its profit guidance for this year after a better than expected Christmas and new year period 
thanks to last-minute bookings.
The airline said yesterday it expected full-year pre-tax profit of between (EURO)950m and (EURO)1.05bn in its 
2020 fiscal year ending in March, up from its previous forecast range of (EURO)800m to (EURO)900m. Based on 
current trading, it expects to hit the midpoint of the new range.
Ryanair stock rose 5.7 per cent yesterday, while easyJet, British Airways owner IAG, and Lufthansa also recorded 
gains as investors bet that Ryanair's rivals had also had a good Christmas.
Ryanair has suffered in the disruption caused by the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jets after two fatal crashes.
It has reduced its forecast for the number of passengers it expects to carry in its 2021 fiscal year twice, as it expects 
to receive only 10 Max jets for the summer of 2020 rather than the 20 it planned. It has outlined plans to close some 
of its bases and in December reduced its forecast for passenger traffic next year by 1m, to 156m.
Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst, said: "EU airlines, and especially short-haul carriers, should make hay while the 
sun shines. With the Max still grounded and capacity growth at lower levels, this may indicate a better yield 
environment through winter and a more supportive trajectory for sector profits."
Ryanair boosts 2020 outlook after Christmas travel upturn
Analysts at broker Liberum said easyJet in particular could have benefited from similar trends, though they warned 
that the effect of the Max grounding and the failure of travel company Thomas Cook meant capacity growth in the 
short-haul market was "especially restrained".
Ryanair said early bookings for this quarter were 1 per cent ahead of last year, with higher than expected fares. It 
increased its forecast for passenger numbers this year from 153m to 154m.
It warned that the outlook for its Austrian airline Laudamotion was less rosy. It has faced price competition in its 
local market so average fares over Christmas were lower than expected. Laudamotion's net loss for the year is 
expected to widen to about (EURO)90m.

Europe's airlines were led higher by Ryanair, which raised full-year net profit guidance by 18 per cent at the 
midpoint thanks to bookings strength through Christmas and New Year.
RWE jumped on reports it had agreed with the German government on a (EURO)2bn compensation package to 
offset costs tied to the early retirement of its lignitefired power stations. The key positive for investors was that 
redundancy costs, estimated at about (EURO)700m, would reportedly be fully covered by the state and excluded 
from RWE's compensation fee. Goldman Sachs put an incremental value on the reported agreement of about 
(EURO)2 a RWE share.
French utility Veolia rose after Exane BNP Paribas turned positive, in part on growing appetite for the stock from 
ethics-guided investors.
Evolution Gaming, the Swedish online casino software maker, hit a record high after revealing an agreement with 
Parx Casino to launch live-dealer games in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
A Morgan Stanley upgrade to "overweight" lifted Trelleborg. It said sales growth had probably troughed last quarter 
and called the Swedish polymer maker "a classic short-cycle industrial that's decoupled from peers". Bryce Elder

offset costs tied to the early retirement of its lignitefired power stations. The key positive for investors was that

from RWE's compensation fee. Goldman Sachs put an incremental value on the reported agreement of about

Ryanair Lifts Full-Year Profit Outlook on Strong Performance in Holiday Period, Expectations of Higher Fares

Ryanair Lifts Full-Year Profit Outlook on Strong Performance in Holiday 
Period, Expectations of Higher Fares Amid Traffic Growth

 Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L), Europe's largest budget airline, lifted its profit guidance for fiscal 2020 as higher fares 
were set to accompany better-than-expected growth in traffic. 
The Dublin-based carrier said in a trading statement that the Christmas and New Year travel period was stronger 
than expected. Close-in bookings were above forecast and pushed yields to a level that was better than anticipated.
Furthermore, Ryanair said forward bookings for January to April were running 1% ahead of this time last year, 
pushing average fares "slightly" above projections in its fiscal fourth quarter. Full-year group traffic is now seen at 
154 million versus previous guidance of 153 million.
"As a consequence of this better Christmas/New Year travel period and stronger forward bookings in the fourth 
quarter, Ryanair believes it is appropriate to raise its full-year profit after tax guidance range," it said in the trading 
update.
Fiscal 2020 profit after tax is now set to come in a range of 950 million euros to 1.05 billion euros ($1.05 billion to 
$1.16 billion), from an earlier forecast of 800 million euros to 900 million euros. On the basis of current trading, 
Ryanair expects pre-tax profit to "finish close to the mid-point of this new range."
The guidance incorporates Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary, Laudamotion, which the Irish airline said continued to 
"underperform" with average fares over Christmas lower than expected, despite strong traffic growth and high load 
factors.
"This is a direct result of intense price competition with Lufthansa subsidiaries in both Germany and Austria who are
engaged in below-cost selling," Ryanair said in its statement.
The airline is scheduled to release its fiscal third-quarter results on Feb. 3.

price rising strongly.Net profit is now expected to stand at between 950 million euros and 1.05 billion euros ($1.06 
billion and $1.67 billion) for its current financial year that ends in March, the Dublin-based airline said in a brief 
statement.That compared with prior guidance of between 800 million euros and 900 million euros."As a 
consequence of this better Christmas/New Year travel period and stronger forward bookings in the fourth quarter, 
Ryanair believes it is appropriate to raise its full year guidance range," said the carrier. 
The forecast gave Ryanair's share price wings Photo: AFP / GERARD JULIEN It cautioned however that its loss-
making Austrian division Laudamotion had underperformed, with average fares lower than expected due to intense 
competition particularly from Lufthansa. Shares in Ryanair were up 5.7 percent at 16.1 euros in late afternoon 
Dublin trading."Ryanair shares are in demand as the airline upped its full-year profit guidance," said David Madden, 
analyst at trading group CMC Markets UK. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said "Ryanair has 
defied fears about the airline market suffering from weaker demand and too much supply".Ryanair is scheduled to

Ryanair raised its full-year profit forecast on Friday after a better-than-expected performance over Christmas and 
New Year, lifting shares in other airlines as analysts said the outlook boded well for the sector.
Europe's largest low-cost operator expects a profit of between 950 million and 1.05 billion euros ($1.17 billion) for 
its financial year to the end of March, versus the 800 to 900 million euro range it forecast in November.
Ryanair's shares were 6.7% higher at 0845 GMT, with fellow budget carriers Easyjet and Wizz Air rising 3.4% and 
4.4% in its slipstream. Shares in British Airways-owner IAG were also up 4.5%.
Better-than-expected forward bookings for January to April come just a month after Ryanair had to cut its summer 
capacity as a result of further delays in returning Boeing's grounded 737 Max aircraft to service.
The Irish carrier said on Friday that on current trading, it expected to finish close to the mid-point of its new profit 
range and the 1.02 billion euros posted in its last financial year, the airline's weakest annual profit in four years.
Ryanair said forward bookings for January to April were running 1% ahead of this time last year, which would mean 
slightly better-than-expected average fourth quarter fares.
Full-year passenger numbers would rise to 154 million from the previously estimated 153 million as a result, it 
added.
Ryanair last month cut its traffic forecast for the year to March 31, 2021 to 156 million from 157 million after 
scrapping some planned summer operations due to delivery delays to the MAX jets on order from Boeing.
Ryanair raises profit forecast after healthy holiday season
That forecast was based on Ryanair receiving 10 MAX aircraft in time for the summer season. It previously cut 
expectations to 20 from the 60 originally scheduled and chief executive Michael O'Leary has since said it may need 
to wait until October for the first MAX plane.
Friday's trading update did not mention the 2021 passenger forecast.
Analysts at Bernstein said Ryanair could be the first signal of a recovery in airline sector profits.
"EU airlines, and especially short haul carriers, should make hay while the sun shines. With the Max still grounded 
and capacity growth at lower levels, this may indicate a better yield environment through winter," Bernstein said in a 
note.
Ryanair also said that Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion continued to underperform, with average fares over 
Christmas lower than expected, despite strong traffic growth and high load factors.
Laudamotion's net loss for the full year would therefore widen from under 80 million euros to around 90 million 
euros. (Reuters)

       The major European markets failed to hold early gains and ended lower on Friday, as investors made cautious 
moves at higher levels after the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions on Iran. 
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced new sanctions on Iran's 
metal exports and eight senior Iranian officials.
 U.S. President Donald Trump had said earlier this week that he would not respond militarily to the Iranian missile 
strikes on Iraq bases housing U.S. troops. Trump, who had earlier threatened harsh responses to any attack by 
Iran, said later that he will only impose new sanctions on Iran's already struggling economy.
 Meanwhile, in a significant development, the House of Representatives on Thursday approved a resolution that 
would force Trump to seek consent from Congress before taking new military action against Iran.
 In the U.K., lawmaker approved a legislation that will allow Britain to exit the European Union on January 31 with a 
withdrawal deal. 
 Optimism about U.S.-China phase one trade deal, set to be signed next week, aided sentiment earlier in the 
session. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to visit Washington in the middle of next week to sign the 
interim trade deal with U.S.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 declined 0.12%. Among the major indices, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 ended down 0.14%, 
while Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both ended lower by 0.09%, and Switzerland's SMI edged down 
0.11%.
 Other markets in Europe turned in a mixed performance. Belgium, Greece, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden 
declined.

       Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc. (RYA.L) were gaining around 9 percent in the early morning trading in London 
after the company raised its profit view for the year to March 2020 based on stronger than expected Christmas and 
New Year travel period and stronger forward bookings in the fourth quarter.
 Ryanair now expects full-year profit after tax in a new range of 950 million pounds to 1.05 billion pounds, higher 
than previous estimate of 800 million pounds to 900 million pounds.
 On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point of this new range.
 In a trading statement, the company said its positive Christmas and New Year travel period was characterized by 
higher than expected close-in bookings at better than expected yields.
 Forward bookings for January to April are running 1% ahead of this time last year. This is expected to result in 
slightly better than expected average fares in the fourth quarter, while full year Group traffic will grow to 154 million, 
up from previous view of 153 million.
 Meanwhile, Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary, Laudamotion, continues to underperform with average. fares over 
Christmas lower than expected, despite strong traffic growth and high load factors.
 The company said the weakness is a direct result of intense price competition with Lufthansa subsidiaries in both 
Germany and Austria who are engaged in below cost selling. Lauda now expects to carry 6.5 million passengers in 
the year to March 2020 but at average fares that are 15 euros below budget.
 The company expects Lauda's net loss for the year will widen to approximately 90 million euros from under 80 
million euros.

       European stocks held steady on Friday as caution set in ahead of the all-important U.S. jobs report due tonight, 
which could give investors additional clues on the health of the world's largest economy and the interest rate 
outlook. 
 Economists expect employment to increase by 164,000 jobs in December after an increase of 266,000 jobs in 
November. The jobless rate is expected to hold at 3.5 percent.
 Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said at an appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations in 
New York on Thursday that the U.S. economy is in a good place and the central bank isn't about to switch course.
 Closer home, France's industrial production grew at a slower pace in November driven by the weakness in 
manufacturing sector, the statistical office Insee said.

Jan 10, 2020( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  European stock markets were 
tantalizingly close to a fresh record on Friday, but stymied by slight disappointment over U.S. jobs data. The Stoxx 
Europe 600 index  SXXP, -0.12%[1] was flat at 419.81, after closing up 0.3% to 419.64 on Thursday, just 0.02% off 
a late December 2019 record finish of 419.74. The German DAX 30 index  DAX, -0.09%[2] rose 0.2% to 13,523.77, 
following a gain of 1.31% on Thursday, which left it 0.5% off a January 2018 record close of 13559.60. The French 
CAC 40 index  PX1, -0.09%[3] was flat at 6,043.43, while the FTSE 100 index  UKX, -0.14%[4] was flat 7,596.66.  
U.S. stocks swept to record highs again on Thursday, as investors focused on positive developments on the trade 
front and an easing of concerns about war in the Middle East. Attention has shifted away from an intense focus on 
geopolitics for Friday, though, to an important reading on the U.S. economy. 
U.S. stock futures indicated modestly higher gains for Wall Street after a jobs rise of 145,000[5] in December, which 
came in slightly short of forecasts for a gain of around 166,000. The data also showed that workers are still not 
reaping a windfall from a stronger market in the form of higher pay.  In Europe, fresh data showed French industrial 
production beat expectations in November, with a gain of 0.3%. The heavily-weighted banking sector stood out as a 
drag on European stocks, with HSBC Holdings  HSBC, -0.74%[6] HSBA, -0.60%[7] down 0.5%, Banco Santander  
SAN, -1.35%[8] SAN, -1.20%[9] falling 0.6% and Lloyds Banking Group  LYG, -2.79%[10] LLOY, -2.46%[11] 
dropping 2.4%. Leading the gainers, shares of Ryanair Holdings  RY4C, +5.62%[12] surged nearly 7% after the cut-
price airline lifted full-year guidance[13] for fiscal 2020 due to a strong Christmas period, though said its Austrian 
subsidiary Laudamotion continues to struggle. 'This could be the first demonstration of a recovery in sector profits 
due to slower short-haul capacity growth as the [Boeing  BA, -1.29%[14] ] Max remains grounded,' analysts Daniel 
Röska and Alex Irving at AB Bernstein told clients in a note. Read: Boeing emails show workers mocking Federal 
Aviation Administration and ridiculing 737 Max's safety[15]  'If a more benign capacity is indeed the root cause of 
the upgrade, Ryanair is unlikely to be the only one to benefit,' they said.  Other airline stocks tracked Ryanair 
higher, with easyJet  EZJ, +4.21%[16] rising 3.3% and multinational airline holding company International 
Consolidated Airlines Group  IAG, +4.63%[17] up 4.7%.  On the downside, shares of B...uropean Value Retail  
BME, -6.09%[18] tumbled close to 7% after the budget retailer said like-for-like sales at its core U.K. business were 
slower-than-expected over Christmas. [19]The post Record finish to elude European stocks as U.S. jobs data falls

Pugnacious ex-pilot Willie Walsh is handing over the controls of International Airlines Group earlier than expected. 
He deserves the nervous ripple of applause captains receive when landing an airliner safely in tricky conditions. 
Shareholders have trebled their money since he took over at British Airways - not bad in Europe's tough airlines 
industry.
The challenge for successor Luis Gallego is to win the support of frequent flyers and trades unionists. Many of them 
will be glad to see Mr Walsh go. Cost-cutting reminiscent of Ryanair spawned the jibe he had turned British Airways 
into "Bryanair".
Financially, IAG is cruising, however.
Mr Gallego shares credit for that. As boss of Iberia, he pulled the Spanish flag carrier out of crash trajectory and 
made it one of the most profitable airlines anywhere. Its return on invested capital in 2018 of 13.2 per cent 
exceeded that of almost every rival.
IAG's is nearly four points higher, reflecting BA's efficiency and Mr Walsh's strategy of "consolidate or die". 
Profitability has improved since 2010. Operating margins have risen from low single digits to an estimated 13 per 
cent in 2019.
The Spaniard's first task will be the integration of IAG's (EURO)1bn purchase, Air Europa. This should strengthen 
the group's hold on flight routes to Latin America and add to its hub at Madrid.
Air Europa will need time to bed down within the Iberia group.
IAG/Willie Walsh: dropping the pilot Twitter : @FTLex
Mr Walsh needed toughness to tackle union members. Many European flag carriers failed to address legacy costs 
and are accordingly on their last legs. At IAG, a pension plan review could save hundreds of millions of pounds 
annually by 2023.
Aggression is a problem when it becomes reflexive. Years of cost cutting triggered BA's first pilot strike last year. 
Cabin crew walked out in 2017.
Mr Gallego needs to rethink what the BA brand means, as well as staff relations. This is no longer the world's 
favourite airline. Rival Lufthansa made it into Skytrax's top 10 airlines ranking in the past two years. BA remains 
stuck one decile down.
A lighter hand on the controls is now required. Consolidation is becoming tougher for IAG to pursue without 
annoying antitrust regulators. Mr Gallego will be helped by the growing maturity of low-cost rivals. The dire carbon 
profile of air travel is a problem all airlines will have to deal with.

Pugnacious ex-pilot Willie Walsh is handing over the controls of International Airlines Group earlier than expected. 
He deserves the nervous ripple of applause captains receive when landing an airliner safely in tricky conditions. 
Shareholders have trebled their money since he took over at British Airways - not bad in Europe's tough airlines 
industry.
The challenge for successor Luis Gallego is to win the support of frequent flyers and trades unionists. Many of them 
will be glad to see Mr Walsh go. Cost-cutting reminiscent of Ryanair spawned the jibe he had turned British Airways 
into "Bryanair".
Financially, IAG is cruising, however.
Mr Gallego shares credit for that. As boss of Iberia, he pulled the Spanish flag carrier out of crash trajectory and 
made it one of the most profitable airlines anywhere. Its return on invested capital in 2018 of 13.2 per cent 
exceeded that of almost every rival.
IAG's is nearly four points higher, reflecting BA's efficiency and Mr Walsh's strategy of "consolidate or die". 
Profitability has improved since 2010. Operating margins have risen from low single digits to an estimated 13 per 
cent in 2019.
The Spaniard's first task will be the integration of IAG's (EURO)1bn purchase, Air Europa. This should strengthen 
the group's hold on flight routes to Latin America and add to its hub at Madrid.
Air Europa will need time to bed down within the Iberia group.
IAG/Willie Walsh: dropping the pilot Twitter : @FTLex
Mr Walsh needed toughness to tackle union members. Many European flag carriers failed to address legacy costs 
and are accordingly on their last legs. At IAG, a pension plan review could save hundreds of millions of pounds 
annually by 2023.
Aggression is a problem when it becomes reflexive. Years of cost cutting triggered BA's first pilot strike last year. 
Cabin crew walked out in 2017.
Mr Gallego needs to rethink what the BA brand means, as well as staff relations. This is no longer the world's 
favourite airline. Rival Lufthansa made it into Skytrax's top 10 airlines ranking in the past two years. BA remains 
stuck one decile down.

Jan 10, 2020( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday 
that it was raising its full-year guidance for fiscal 2020 on the back of stronger trading over the Christmas period, but 
that Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion has continued to underperform and that its loss for the year is expected to 
widen. The low-cost carrier  RYA, +6.37%[1] said it now expects its profit after tax for its fiscal year ending March 
31 to be in the range of 950 million to 1.05 billion euros ($1.05 billion-$1.17 billion). Its previous guidance was 
EUR800 million to EUR900 million. 
The company said January to April forward bookings are running 1% ahead of the same period last year and that it 
believes this will result in better than expected average fares during the fourth quarter. The airline said it expects full 
year passenger traffic to grow to 154 million. It had previously guided for 153 million. Ryanair said Laudamotion was 
still underperforming, with lower-than-expected average fares over the Christmas season despite strong traffic 
growth and high load factors. The company said this was due to intense price competition with Deutsche Lufthansa 
AG  LHA, +0.09%[2] (LHA.XE)'s subsidiaries in both Germany and Austria.  Laudamotion is now expected to carry 
6.5 million passengers in fiscal 2020, but average fares will be EUR15 million below budget, resulting in a widened 
net loss for the airline of about EUR90 million, Ryanair said.The post Dow Jones Newswires: Ryanair lifts guidance,

 Ryanair (RYAAY) raised its full-year, after-tax profit guidance to a new range of EUR950 million to EUR1.05 billion 
($1.05 billion to $1.16 billion) after a better-than-expected holiday travel period.
The Irish budget carrier said in a statement on Friday that forward bookings for the January-April period were 
running 1% ahead of the same period last year. Ryanair said that it expects to finish the fiscal year ending in March 
close to the mid-point of its new guidance range.
Despite the raised guidance, the carrier said it expects its Laudamotion subsidiary to underperform due to 
heightened price competition. The Austrian-based subsidiary expects passenger traffic at 6.5 million in the year to 
March 2020 but at average fares that are EUR15 below budget, resulting in a widened net loss of approximately 
EUR90 million.
The low-cost airline group also said that it anticipates full-year passenger traffic growing to 154 million from the 
previous estimate of 153 million.

Highlight: IAG and EasyJet top FTSE 100 after Ryanair lifts profit forecast but rash of weak updates from retailers 
sends their shares lower.
Body
Airline stocks have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 after Ryanair (RYA.I) lifted its profit forecast, but a rash of 
weak updates from retailers have sent their shares lower.
British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) was the biggest riser on a flat FTSE 100, up 4.6% at 
663.9p on the bullish update from its Irish budget rival. EasyJet (EZJ) was close behind, up 4% at £14.96 while on 
the FTSE 250, Wizz Air (WIZZ) was up 5.6% at £40.74.
Ryanair raised its profit forecast for the year to up to €1.05bn, up from a range of €800m to €900m, sending its 
shares 7.2% higher.
'The whole airline sector was rising in Ryanair's tailwind after a very encouraging update from the budget carrier,' 
said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
'Investors' attention will always be grabbed by a big number and Ryanair has duly delivered, raising the upper end 
of its full-year profit guidance above the €1 billion mark.'
Retail stocks were meanwhile in the red, as the embattled sector came under pressure from a series of weak 
updates.
On the FTSE 250, B&M (BME) was the biggest faller, down 8.4% at 364p as the retailer reporting slowing sales 
growth in the crucial Christmas quarter.
Like-for-like sales rose just 0.3% over the period, down from 3.5% in the previous quarter. 'Today's third quarter 
sales confirmed the impact of a soft UK pre-election market,' said Numis analyst James Grzinic, who pointed to 'a 
promotionally competitive backdrop which B&M chose not to join'.
Superdry (SDRY) was the heaviest 'small-cap' faller, down 15.3% at 399.8p, after the clothing retailer reported 
lower-than-expected Christmas sales that could wipe out full-year profits.
'Co-founder Julian Dunkerton's return to Superdry as chief executive is starting to look like a difficult second album 
rather than an overnight success,' said Mould.
Airlines top FTSE on Ryanair boost but retail stocks suffer fresh slide
'A dodgy Christmas trading period means there may now be no profit at all in the current financial year. The weak 
performance was partly blamed on old stock.'
On the Alternative Investment Market, Joules (JOUL) tumbled 21.9% to 176.5p as the fashion retailer warned 2020 
profits would be significantly below market expectations due to a misallocation of stock over Christmas.
'While we are disappointed to see Joules unable to fulfil the potential from strong Christmas demand, we take some 
consolation that the demand was there and that this should be a one-off issue that does not reoccur,' said John 
Stevenson, analyst at Peel Hunt.

Jan 10, 2020( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)             https://www.eureporter.co/wp-
content/uploads/2019/07/eu-flags-european-parliament-building.jpgThe Legal Affairs Committee confirmed on 
Thursday (9 January) Parliament's negotiating position on a new bill introducing EU-wide rules on collective 
redress. This means that MEPs can soon start negotiating the final shape that the legislation will take with Council, 
which has also approved itsgeneral approach on the matter[1]. The Legal Affairs Committee confirmed Parliament's 
negotiating position with 20 votes in favour and two abstentions. 
The draft rules allow consumer organizations to seek remedy, enforce a high level of protection and to represent 
the collective interest of consumers. Collective action would be authorized against trader violations, in domestic and 
cross-border cases, in areas such as data protection, financial services, travel and tourism, energy, 
telecommunications, environment and health. The text approved by MEPs[2]also introduces the 'loser pays 
principle', which ensures that the losing party reimburses the winning party's legal costs, to avoid abusive use of the 
new instrument. The proposed legislation reflects concerns raised by mass harm scandals with cross-border 
implications, e.g. Dieselgate and Ryanair. Eligible representation Representative action cases would only be 
brought by eligible entities, such as consumer organisations and certain independent bodies, on behalf of a group 
of consumers. These entities should be non-profit and have no financial agreements with law firms. The new rules 
would strengthen the right to access to justice by allowing consumers to join forces across borders and to jointly 
request that unlawful practices be stopped or prevented (injunction), or to obtain compensation for the harm caused 
(redress). More details on EP's mandate, following plenary vote (26.03.2019)[3] Background The Representative 
Action Directive is part of the New Deal for Consumers, launched in April 2018 by the Commission, to ensure 
stronger consumer protection in the EU. It includes stronger consumer rights online, tools to enforce rights and 
compensation, penalties for violating EU consumer law and improved business conditions. More information EPRS

Jan 09, 2020( GuruFocus.com: http://www.gurufocus.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
(NASDAQ:RYAAY[1]), the leading ultra-low-cost carrier in Europe that is headquartered in Ireland, was the largest 
contributor for the quarter. The company's fiscal year 2020 second-quarter results exceeded consensus estimates. 
Ryanair's 11% revenue growth was in line with our expectations and its revenue per available seat mile beat our 
expectations and also appears well positioned to achieve management's 2-3% growth target for fiscal year 2020. 
Management expects traffic to grow by 8% to 153 million for the fiscal year, which is slightly ahead of our estimates. 
We are also glad to see signs of a more rational competitive environment as Ryanair's peers reduce capacity, 
which should help pricing going forward, and labor relations continue to improve. In addition, despite the reduction 
in Boeing MAX 737 deliveries, management did not reduce its passenger growth guidance for fiscal year 2021. We 
believe the lower supply growth should be a tailwind to pricing. From David Herro[2] (Trades[3], Portfolio[4])'s

Aer Lingus owner IAG says Willie Walsh to stand down
Aer Lingus owner IAG says Willie Walsh to stand down

Willie Walsh, head of Aer Lingus and British Airways parent firm IAG, will step down in June from the airlines group 
he helped build and hand the reins to Luis Gallego, current CEO of IAG's Iberia.
Walsh said in November that succession planning was under way as he intended to retire as chief executive in the 
next two years. Gallego has been CEO of Iberia since 2014.
Irishman Walsh, a former pilot, has spent his career in the industry and has been instrumental in establishing IAG.
He became CEO of British Airways in 2005 and oversaw its merger with Iberia in 2011 to form IAG. He has since 
expanded IAG through acquisitions.
IAG chairman Antonio Vazquez said that Gallego was the right candidate to lead IAG in the next stage of its 
development, as did Walsh.
"Luis has been a core member of the team and has shown true leadership over the years and I have no doubt he 
will be a great CEO of IAG," Walsh said in a statement on Thursday.
Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said the appointment would mean little change in IAG's strategy and would be 
welcomed by investors.
Walsh had "fantastic success at building IAG but obviously promoting internally is seen as a positive. The market 
regards his successor well," Simpson said.
Aer Lingus owner IAG says Willie Walsh to stand down
Walsh made his name standing up to unions and cutting costs first at Ireland's Aer Lingus, where he became CEO 
in 2001, and then at British Airways, earning him the nickname Slasher Walsh in an industry he once characterized 
as a "fight for survival."
It was at Aer Lingus where he formed the template for his strategy, benefitting from a front-row seat to the rapid 
expansion of budget rival Ryanair.
Walsh was much quicker than rival European flag carriers Air France-KLM and Lufthansa to embrace budget flying. 
IAG bought short-haul carrier Vueling in 2015 and set up long-haul low-cost carrier Level in 2017.
He also bought Aer Lingus in 2015, and IAG is currently in the process of a 1 billion euro deal to buy Spain's Air 
Europa.
IAG said that Walsh, 58, would step down from his role and the board of IAG on March 26 before retiring on June 
30.
Gallego's successor at Iberia will be announced in due course, IAG said. (Reuters)

Jan 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines AAL[1], with 24 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, inked a deal with the manufacturer of the planes 
— The Boeing Company BA[2] — pertaining to compensation for losses due to the grounding of the planes since 
March 2019. American Airlines aims to share part of the compensation with its workers under the company's profit-
sharing scheme.Alaska Air Group ALK[3] — the parent company of Alaska Airlines —also featured in the headlines 
when its long-serving chief financial officer (CFO) Brandon Pedersen announced his intention to retire on Mar 2, 
2020. Pedersen was the company's outside auditor for 11 years prior to joining it in 2003 as the vice president of 
finance and controller. He was promoted to his current position in May 2010.Meanwhile, Latin American carrier, 
Azul AZUL[4] and European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported year-over-year increase in their respective 
traffic numbers for December mainly backed by strong demand for air travel. Furthermore, United Airlines UAL[6] 
announced that it will not operate flights connecting the Dayton International Airport and George Bush 
Intercontinental Airport in Houston, TX.(Read the lastAirline Stock Rounduphere[7])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. American Airlines, which expects the Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet to be grounded through 
Apr 7, 2020, will reportedly share $30 million[8] of the compensation it would receive from Boeing, with employees. 
The payment is likely to be made this March, under its profit-sharing scheme. Notably, American Airlines is not the 
only U.S.-based carrier which will receive compensation from Boeing due to losses related to the Max grounding. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[9], which enjoys the largest exposure to Boeing 737 MAX jets among U.S. carriers with 34 
such jets in its fleet, also inked a deal with the plane manufacturer last month for partial compensation for losses 
due to the groundings. However, details of the deal remain undisclosed. Some other 737 MAX customers, including 
Turkish Airlines, too have signed deals with Boeing seeking compensation for losses.2. During Pedersen's tenure 
as CFO, Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America, thereby expanding its presence significantly, particularly on the 
West Coast. Pederson will be replaced by Shane Tackett, who currently serves as the company's executive vice 
president of planning and strategy. Tackett has served Alaska Air Group in multiple capacities ever since joining it 
in 2000. (Read more:Alaska Air Group Picks New CFO, Incumbent to Retire[10]).3. At Ryanair, December traffic 
(including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) was up 9% year over year to 11.2 million. However, load 
factor (% of seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 95%. Moreover, the company's CEO Michael 
O'Leary reportedly [11]stated that the carrier is unlikely to receive its first 737 MAX delivery from Boeing before

October 2020. (Read more: Ryanair's December Traffic Rises 9% Amid 737 MAX Uncertainty[12]).4. At Azul, 
consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) increased 27.2% year over year to 2.96 billion, 
owing to 25.7% growth on the domestic front and 31.1% rise, internationally. On a year-over-year basis, 
consolidated capacity (measured in available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 26.5% to 3.54 billion, driven by a 
24.3% expansion in domestic capacity and a 32.8% increase in international capacity. (Read more: Azul's Traffic

Crotone Sant'Anna Airport has lost its only international service after Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) cancelled plans to 
resume flights from the Calabrese gateway to Nuremberg during the Summer 2020 season. The last flight on the 
681-nautical mile sector (1,261-kilometre), which was flown 2x weekly as flight FR8565/8566, was operated on 
October 26, 2019. According to the ch-aviation schedules module, the withdrawal of this service from Germany, 
which comes as a result of the airline's Nuremberg base closure, leaves Crotone with just domestic flights to Milan 
Bergamo and Bologna, currently flown 4x weekly and 3x weekly respectively. Ryanair resumed services to the 
southern Italian city in the Summer 2018 season, and it is Crotone's only serving scheduled carrier.

For all the investor protests about executive pay in 2019 - think Standard Life Aberdeen, Standard Chartered, 
Bovis, Ryanair - have the arguments really changed since the late 1980s? Back then, student Lombard was 
listening to leftwing indie band McCarthy intoning (sarcastically): "You know, to be in business, to run a company, 
you really need to use your head; Show me a man of money, and I will show you a genius." Yesterday, a more 
seasoned Lombard was listening to rightwing think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs opining (seriously): "In 
today's globalised economy, the role of the chief executive has become significantly more important ... [in] our 
obsession with high pay, we dismiss the achievements of successful CEOs."
It did not scan quite as well, but it provided a riposte to a new report on bosses' remuneration from the High Pay 
Centre and personnel body the CIPD, which found FTSE 100 chief executives have been paid 117 times more than 
the average worker (or more if one disputes their calculation of a CEO's pay-rate based on 320 12-hour days per 
year, ie working three out of four weekends, full-time).
To the IEA, paying the going rate for a star CEO is in employees' interests, too, as "the successes, failures and 
sudden departures of CEOs can increase or diminish a company's worth by billions of pounds - which can also 
result in the gain or loss of thousands of jobs". If that sounded familiar, it is because it is a reprise of the institute's 
2015 musings when Tidjane Thiam left Prudential for a CEO role at Credit Suisse, knocking £1.3bn off the Pru's 
market value and adding £2bn to the Swiss bank's.
To business minister Andrea Leadsom, the more important fact was that "the numbers are better" - in last year's 
report, the CEO pay ratio was 133 times - and mandatory reporting of the figures will "increase transparency around 
Link executive pay to future profit, not historic CEO ratios UK COMPANIES
how directors meet their responsibilities". If that sounded familiar, it is because it played to the same themes as the 
prime minister's recent pledges about "One Nation" government and workers' rights.
However, both are arguably wrong.
Hiring highly paid CEOs might lead to short-term share price movements, but research from Vlerick Business 
School shows there is no relationship between highly paid CEOs and profit. It concludes that "better performing 
firms do not pay their CEOs more". And it is profit performance, not share prices, that determine long-term 
investment returns and job creation.
Making pay ratios more transparent will not focus directors' or investors' minds, either. Ratios are historic. Pay votes 
are forward looking and often on complex long-term incentive plans. Simpler, profit-related pay deals are a better 
way to align long-term investor, employee and executive interests.
How could a politician not realise this? To quote McCarthy's satirical lyrics: "You know, to be able to run the 
government, you need a bloody good brain; To be an MP you must be someone well above the common run."

Jan 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The year 2019 has been 
a disappointing one for Boeing's BA[1] commercial business, which received a severe blow after its best-selling 737 
Max planes were grounded in March, following two crashes claiming 346 lives. A production rate cut for these jets 
announced last April followed by the eventual suspension of production in December came as another jolt.The 
unfavorable turn out of events kept Boeing under immense pressure, affecting the airlines industry as well. This is 
because when more than 700 of Boeing's 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide last March, airlines with a 
large number of 737 Max jets in their fleet started to incur significant losses.Will Airlines Recover the Losses?
Per a report by U.K.-based flight data information firm OAG, Boeing's 737 Max grounding is estimated to have hurt 
global airline industry revenues by $4.1 billion in 2019, including a cumulative loss of $600 million of three U.S. 
airlines.Since the actual numbers of 2019 have not been released so far, we are yet to ascertain how far the 
estimation is appropriate. Nevertheless, Boeing's airline customers have demanded a compensation to recover the 
losses they have been incurring since the 737 Max grounding.To this end, it is imperative to mention that last July 
Boeing took a $4.9-billion charge into account for paying the compensation. Moreover, the company has designated 
$6.1 billion to pay airliners through a combination of cash, discounts and other benefits, per a report by The Wall 
Street Journal.Once Boeing starts paying these compensations, we may expect the affected airline stocks to 
gradually benefit, over time.3 US-Based Airlines to Receive CompensationSouthwest Airlines LUV[2], which 
currently is the biggest customer of the 737 MAX aircraft, is entitled to receive a compensation for some of the 
financial damages incurred owing to the grounding. Although the terms of the agreement have been kept under 
wraps, we expect Boeing to cough up a heavy sum to the Dallas-based airliner.American Airlines Group AAL[3] has 
also entered into a confidential agreement with Boeing in January, wherein it will receive compensation for several 
years. American Airlines has however disclosed plan of distributing more than $30 million of the money among its 
employees via its 2019 profit-sharing program.Per a report by Reuters, United Airlines UAL[4] has extended 
cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights from early March until June 2020. United Airlines is yet to reveal how much 
the 737 MAX grounding has costed the carrier, but we may expect the compensation to be a huge one.Other Airline 
Companies Seeking CompensationPer a report published by Simple Flying, carries such as Ryanair, AeroMexico, 
Icelandair and Norwegian Airlines seem to be progressing with the compensation discussions with Boeing.Recently, 
Boeing agreed to pay damages to Turkish Airlines for losses caused by the grounded and undelivered Boeing 737 
Max aircraft. Per Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper, the total compensation Turkish Airlines would receive amounts to 
Boeing Set to Pay Hefty Compensations to Airline Companies
$225 million.As Boeing will soon release its fourth quarterly and full-year 2019 financial results, we expect to get an 
idea of the extent of damage these compensation charges have had on its results.Just Released: Zacks' 7 Best

Jan 06, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive December 2019 traffic figures, primarily owing to solid air-travel demand. Traffic 
(including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) was up 9% year over year to 11.2 million in the 
month.However, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 95%. This European low-cost 
carrier's passenger growth, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was 7% in the month. On a rolling annual basis, 
total traffic increased 9% to 152.4 million.In fact, robust growth in passenger traffic has been hugely responsible for 
Ryanair's shares having an impressive run on the bourses lately. 
In the past six months, shares of this Irish carrier have gained in excess of 32% compared with itsindustry[2]'s mere 
1% growth.The impressive traffic report is a further positive for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can 
seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[3].Despite the impressive stock-price movement backed 
by strong demand for air travel, Ryanair is not bereft of headwinds. Notably, the company has been suffering due to 
the prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. In fact, these planes have been grounded since March 2019 
following the twin air crashes in different parts of the world, over a span of five months, apparently due to software 
malfunctioning. These woes are unlikely to be resolved any time soon as can be made out from the commentary of 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary. According to a Reuters report[4], O'Leary has noted that Ryanair is unlikely to 
receive its first 737 MAX delivery from Boeing before this October.In fact, delivery delays are pushing up non-fuel 
costs, thereby hurting Ryanair's bottom line. Evidently, non-fuel unit costs are projected to flare up 2% in fiscal 2020 
(ending Mar 31, 2020), primarily due to delivery delays of the Boeing 737 MAX planes.Ryanair is not the only carrier 
to be suffering due to the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. Its U.S. counterparts — Southwest Airlines LUV[5], 
American Airlines AAL[6] and United Airlines UAL[7] — have been equally affected by the issue. With no clarity 
available as to when the jets would resume flying, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines 
currently expect the Boeing 737 MAX jets in their respective fleets to remain grounded through Apr 7, Apr 13, and 
Jun 4, 2020, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all

Accused CEOs have a history of skipping out in style
Accused CEOs have a history of skipping out in style

C arlos Ghosn is accused of a big fiddle in Japan. But a double bass did not feature in his escape. Pity. The claim 
he hid inside a musical instrument case would have been the most piquant detail in accounts of his audacious flit. 
The former chief executive of Nissan otherwise stuck to the time-honoured traditions of tycoons on the lam. He fled 
by air to a country where his status as an investor meant he would be welcome.
Countries popular with business fugitives also tend to be helpfully sanguine over allegations of financial impropriety. 
Mr Ghosn is now in Lebanon. Kobi Alexander, former CEO of New York-based Comverse Technology, headed for 
Namibia in 2006. Asil Nadir, a prominent UK businessman, holed up in northern Cyprus for 17 years.
Japan, in contrast, is a law-abiding place. This could explain the apparent ease with which Mr Ghosn skipped house 
arrest and bail. A surveillance camera was watching his front door. The Japanese police may have assumed no one 
would be so underhand as to sneak out the back. Game, set and match to Mr Ghosn's private security contractors. 
They can now add "executive outplacement" to their list of services. Mr Ghosn would hardly have deigned to 
masquerade as a double bass, though. It is a background orchestral instrument. He is accustomed to starring roles. 
It is easier to picture him escaping inside a concert grand piano - a Bosendorfer, or a Steinway. He travelled to 
Turkey aboard a private jet, as you would expect of a high-status fugitive.
Less glamorously, a 2017 Ryanair flight to Greece was the last known whereabouts of Ruja Ignatova, a selfstyled 
cryptocurrency entrepreneur indicted for fraud in the US. Her One-Coin business, widely condemned as a Ponzi 
scheme, attracted an estimated (EURO)4bn from investors. Like the money, Ms Ignatova could now be anywhere.
Accused CEOs have a history of skipping out in style
Business people who are in hot water have a habit of disappearing. Pretending to be dead is one refinement, 
usefully sapping the resolve of would-be pursuers. David Elias, whose SLS Capital was implicated in City frauds, 
was reportedly alive and well in 2011, two years after his obituary was published.
Possibly the second best-known subject of premature death reports (after Mark Twain) was John Stonehouse. The 
British businessman and politician faked drowning on a Miami beach in 1974. It later emerged he was a Communist 
spy. This came as a terrible shock to the British establishment as he had not even attended Cambridge university.
But it is tricky defending your reputation from beyond the grave, even if you are not interred in one. Since he is still 
officially alive, Mr Ghosn is able to vehemently deny all allegations against him. He blames these on a power 
struggle within Nissan.
Lebanon is a natural bolt hole. Though French, Mr Ghosn is of Lebanese heritage and has investments there, 
including a winery. German-Finnish digital maverick Kim Dotcom took a bigger risk in applying for New Zealand 
residency. He received this under "investor plus" rules, but later failed a "good character" test to buy land. His 
beneficence has included funding a firework display at Auckland harbour. After he fled the US, Mr Alexander 
invested heavily in the Namibian tech sector - which frankly needs it more than the latest Silicon Valley start-up. 
Both men were then embroiled in lengthy US extradition proceedings.
Handily for Mr Ghosn, Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Some version of the charges against him may 
be heard in Lebanon, but fugitive executives can only achieve full closure by facing their accusers on home ground. 
That takes guts: escaping only requires nerve. Mr Alexander and Mr Nadir both came back and were duly rewarded 
with jail terms. Knowing that, Mr Ghosn may understandably opt to stay put.

ARMENIA Georgia has enjoyed soaring visitor numbers, and a string of new airline routes, since it was tipped in the 
equivalent of this article two years ago. Visits by international tourists during the first 11 months of 2019 were up 
19.4 per cent compared with the same period in 2017. Meanwhile its southern neighbour Armenia has remained 
relatively off the radar - attracting fewer than a quarter of Georgia's visitor numbers - though that now seems to be 
on the verge of change. Four members of our panel picked Armenia as one to watch in 2020 (Wild Frontiers says 
its forward bookings are up 100 per cent compared with a year go) and the country will get its first low-cost airline 
links with western Europe. Ryanair, Wizz and Air Baltic are all due to launch flights, connecting the capital Yerevan 
with cities including Milan, Rome, Berlin and Vienna.
The main draw for visitors is the country's extraordinary collection of medieval monasteries and churches, many of 
them set among dramatic mountains. Geghard monastery, for example, was cut into the rock of the Upper Azat 
valley and was completed in the 13th century. It is now a Unesco world heritage site, as are the monasteries at 
Haghpat and Sanahin. But Yerevan and the wine-lands are also fascinating. "Yerevan is one of the region's most 
exuberant and endearing cities," says Justin Wateridge of Steppes Travel. "Both country and capital are an 
unexpected delight that you need to discover before the secret gets out."

Tom Marchant of Black Tomato recommends the newly opened Alexander hotel in Yerevan, part of Marriott's 
Luxury Collection, as well as stopping for a degustation at the Ararat Brandy Company.
CHAD For travellers who really want to get off the beaten track, Chad is ideal. More than five times the size of the 
UK, the entire country gets fewer visitors in a year than Tate Modern gets in a week. And that is despite glorious 
desert and mountain scenery, fascinating ancient rock art and the closest "big five" safari park to Europe.
The bad news is that there is a reason for such a dearth of visitors: the UK Foreign Office advises against "all but 
essential" travel to most of the country, and "all travel" to the rest, highlighting the potential risk of crime and 
terrorism; the US State Department suggests potential visitors "reconsider".
Despite that, several tour operators tip it as a rising destination for the coming year, a recommendation that is 
largely down to the work of African Parks, a South African-based non-profit conservation organisation. In 2010 it 
was invited by the Chadian government to sign a long-term agreement to manage Zakouma National Park, a 1,200 
sq mile park in the south-east of the country that had been ransacked by horseback-riding poaching gangs. With 
the help of EU funding, African Parks restored security (elephant deaths fell from 4,000 in the eight years to 2010, 
to just 24 since then), opened 17 schools and created employment at the three tourist camps. In 2017, the 
government put an expanded area around the park into African Parks control, then in February 2018 the 
organisation was given responsibility for the Ennedi Natural and Cultural Reserve, a 15,500 sq mile expanse of 
sandstone mountains in the north of the country, filled with dramatic canyons, cliffs and arches as well as rock art 
that dates back 7,000 years. "Declared a World Heritage Site in 2016, the Ennedi is a vast wilderness with a 
savage beauty," says Will Jones of Journeys By Design.
"Exploring it using private mobile camps, then transferring to Zakouma is an extraordinary combination." Alice 
Daunt says she will be visiting this year "for its deserts, nomadic people, rock art and formations" but also thanks to 
"a chance encounter with a London Uber driver from N'Djamena."UK Britain maybe preparing to leave the EU in 
2020, but the British national tourism agency is predicting a record year. Visit Britain says international tourist 
numbers will hit 39.7m, the highest ever and almost 5 per cent up on 2018. Particularly important to the growth are 
emerging tourism markets in the east - Visit Britain's data shows flight bookings to the UK for the first half of the 
year are up 33 per cent from China, and 22 per cent from south usa.
While the reduced value of sterling has helped make the UK cheaper, the big draw this year is likely to be the 
country's literary and artistic heritage. 2020 is the 250th anniversary of William Wordsworth's birth (marked by a 
£6.2m project to expand the museum at his former home, Dove Cottage at Grasmere in the Lake District) and the 
150th anniversary of Charles Dicken's death (with a five-day festival in Rochester among many others). Meanwhile 
the lack of a significant anniversary does not seem to have deterred Jane Austen fans: a 10-day festival is planned 
in Bath in September, there is a nine-day festival in Hampshire in June, and yet another film version of Emma is 
due for release in February, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and a string of fabulous stately homes.
Meanwhile, a Game of Thrones Studio Tour is due to open in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, this spring and 
Glastonbury celebrates its 50th anniversary with headliners including Paul McCartney and Diana Ross.
NORWAY A growing awareness of climate change has brought the Arctic regions to the forefront of many minds. 
On one hand, the vulnerability of the ice caps, wildlife and traditional ways of life inspires an increasingly emotional 
reaction - the endangered glaciers pitied in the same way as the elephants and rhinos of east Africa. On the other, 
in a warming world, spending a summer holiday somewhere cold rather than hot seems increasingly attractive. 
Above all, the Arctic has become so much more visible: consider, for example, that in 48 hours over Christmas, the 
BBC's output included radio broadcasts from Greenland and Iceland, a two-hour "slow TV" programme following a 
Sami sleigh ride through Arctic Norway, and a film about the disappearing skills of the Inuit, "an elegy to the world 
that is melting away". Even Hollywood is leveraging the appeal of the north: Disney's new children's movie Frozen 2 
draws heavily on Sami culture, myths and landscapes while the forthcoming James Bond movie No Time to Die, out 
in April, includes snowy sequences filmed in Norway.

While countries across the north are experiencing growing visitor numbers, Norway is especially well placed to 
benefit, with infrastructure that makes it straightforward to reach the Arctic, and an abundance of fjords, mountains 
and islands. Set among them are a growing number of landmark architectural projects by the Oslo-based practice 
Snohetta, a master at creating buildings that manage to be both appropriate to the stark beauty of their 
surroundings as well as catnip for social media. Among them are Europe's first underwater restaurant, launched in 
March 2019, the National Opera house in Oslo, a remote pavilion for watching passing reindeer at Hjerkinn, and the 
forthcoming Svart, a circular hotel just above the Arctic Circle, which isn't due to open until 2022 but is already 
generating a buzz.
"Interest in all things Nordic continues to grow," says Georgina Hancock at Discover the World, who tips Senja 
Island, to the west of Tromso, as "a quieter, under-explored alternative to the well-trodden Lofoten Islands". At Red 
Savannah, George Morgan-Grenville reports forward bookings for Norway up 33 per cent compared with this point 
a year ago. Both agree about the appeal of Svalbard, which in 2020 marks 100 years of Norwegian sovereignty, 
and offers the chance to visit the world's northernmost city, school, museum, piano and much more. "Nowhere is 
more wild," says Morgan-Grenville.
TURKEY Tourism in Turkey collapsed in 2015 and 2016 in response to terrorist attacks and political instability, with 
visitor numbers falling almost 40 per cent.
Those security fears have now eased, and tourist numbers are rebounding - helped by a significant devaluation of 
the lira (a euro currently buys about 6.6 Turkish lira, up from about 2 lira a decade ago). That exchange rate has 
made city breaks more affordable in Istanbul, with its constantly expanding roster of luxury hotels. Recent additions 
include Sofitel on Taksim square, which opened in November complete with 33 Hermésdesigned suites) and the 
Six Senses Kocatas Mansions, which soft-launched the same month, housed in two 19thcentury mansions and with 
far-reaching views over the Bosphorus.
The longer term trend, however, is for adventure-seeking tourists to look beyond Istanbul and the Mediterranean 
seaside resorts. Steppes highlight the move of the World Nomad Games this year from a remote yurt village in 
Kyrgyzstan to the Turkish city of Bursa, making it far easier for international visitors to watch events including 
kokboru, a sort of central usan equivalent of rugby, with competitors on horseback and a headless goat in place of a 
ball (the date for the event has yet to be announced). In the far east, the ancient archaeological sites of Upper 
Mesopotamia are attracting growing interest, with numerous operators offering expert-led group tours. Meanwhile 
skiers in search of perfect powder and a complete absence of crowds are travelling to Turkey Heliski's base in 
Ayder, close to the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea, where visitors this winter are expected to include the star 
Swiss free-rider Sam Anthamatten.
JAPAN Data from eDreams ODIGEO, which claims to be Europe's biggest online travel agency, suggests a surge 
in the number of European travellers heading to Tokyo in 2020. Across its various websites, forward bookings are 
up 90 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. There is one obvious reason: the Olympics and 
Paralympics, due to take place in late July and early August. Some estimates suggest the Games might attract an 
additional 10m visitors, and there has been a rush of hotel openings in expectation.
Tourism in the country is already Where I'm going: Iain Sinclair In 2020, my travelling is likely to focus on 
somewhere I've not really been at all - north-east Scotland and the Orkneys.
Most of my travelling in the past has been in the orbit of London, but unusually for me I've been in Peru this year 
[2019] on something of a ghost hunt to research my next book. I was following an expedition that my great-
grandfather made in 1891 and wrote about and left a map of. Now I'm examining the territory he came from, and 
was forced to leave during the time of the Highland Clearances.
I need to visit places like Banff and Forres in north-east Scotland and ultimately the Orkney Islands to track him 
down. I'll be up there for a few weeks, around April, May, June, and of all the places I intend to visit, Orkney is 
probably the most romantic; it pushes back to the origins of life in these islands. I'm very keen to look at those 
ancient settlements. But from Aberdeen on, it'll all be new and strange to me.
Where to go in 2020 Where I'm going: Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent From Armenia to the snows of Svalbard - our 
panel of tourism industry leaders pick the hottest des....
Iain Sinclair's latest books are 'The Last London' (Oneworld) and 'Living with Buildings' (Wellcome Collection) Next 
year my boyfriend and I are going to live in Georgia for six months. We'll be based in Tbilisi, and the idea is to 
explore the lesser known creases and folds of the Caucasus Mountains. I'm particularly looking forward to 
discovering the Racha region in the north-west.
I've been to the country maybe four or five times. I don't normally go back to places, but I love the food, the wine 
and the vivaciousness of the people.
Generally, I'm trying to fly less - and I no longer fly for personal journeys. I've been on expeditions in the past using 
tuk tuks and motorbikes, but this time we've got a very boring Subaru 4x4 for the mountains and we're going to 
drive from the UK, going through Turkey and Bulgaria - stopping off for a bit of skiing - on our way to Georgia.
I have started really thinking about how I travel. I went on holiday recently by train to the south of France from 
Bristol. People often think if you stop flying it means you stop travelling - but that's not the case. It makes you think 
in a different way; overland travel is so rewarding. You see so much more; it's a much deeper way of travelling.
Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent's latest book is 'Land of the Dawn-lit Mountains' (Simon & Schuster) soaring: 31.2m 
foreign travellers visited in 2018, up from 8.6m in 2010. In 2016 the government set a target of reaching 40m 
visitors by 2020, and 60m by 2030. The downside has been the concentration of visitors in the honeypot sites of 
Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, something the national tourist office has tried to counter with publicity campaigns 
promoting lesser-known regions, and which should be helped by new flight routes including, for example, Finnair's 
direct service to Sapporo, on the northern island of Hokkaido, which launched last month.
"Quite apart from the Olympics, Japan is increasingly on the radar of those seeking alternative, experiential travel 
and a completely unhomogenised cultural identity," says George Morgan-Grenville. of Red Savannah.
He suggests 2020 hotspots will include the Samurai districts of Kanazawa, the scenic coastline of Noto, and the art 
museums of Naoshima Island.
URUGUAY "Uruguay has always been considered a seasonal destination, but is just as special outside the 
December/January rush," says Harry Hastings of Plan South America. "It's ideal for 'slow travel', with cycling and 
riding trips through olive groves, vineyards, fishing villages and the open farmland of the south, stopping for sea 
swims, picnics, wine tasting and visits to artists' studios."
Home to fewer than 3.5m people, the country has long been in the shadow of its neighbours, Brazil and Argentina, 
with only the sceney seaside resorts of Punta del Este and José Ignacio attracting much international attention, and 
even then only in summer. Now, though, small numbers of visitors are beginning to look beyond those hotspots, to 
the remote beaches of Rocha state, the surfer hang-out of La Pedrera, the old Portuguese city of Colonia del 
Sacramento and sleepy Carmelo, surrounded by vineyards, wineries and tasting rooms and known by some as 
South America's answer to Tuscany. Visitors should explore rich, full-bodied reds made with Tannat grapes, 
produced from vines descended from cuttings across the Atlantic in the 19th century before phylloxera devastated 
the originals in southern France.
DOMINICA The mountainous Caribbean island has staged a remarkable recovery from the devastation of 
Hurricane Maria in 2017, while promotional campaigns billing it as "the nature island" seem more in tune with the 
times than some of its glitzier neighbours.
Rather than white sands and smart restaurants, the draw here is the pristine rainforests, remote mountain gorges 
and waterfalls. The tourist board is keen to distinguish it as a place for adventure travellers and in particular as a 
place for hiking: the country is home to the longest walking route in the Caribbean, the 185km Waitukubuli trail and 
a system of free "hike passports" was introduced in 2019 for visitors to record their walks. The government has 
been working to restore trails damaged in the hurricane, while also introducing a string of environmental policies 
(plastic straws and cutlery were banned last year; plastic bags are due to be banned outright in 2020).
Where to go in 2020 Where I'm going: Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent From Armenia to the snows of Svalbard - our 
panel of tourism industry leaders pick the hottest des....
While eco-tourism remains the focus, the accommodation options are moving increasingly upmarket. Secret Bay, a 
glorious clifftop retreat that closed when the hurricane struck, reopened in November 2018 with major upgrades. It 
now comprises six villas built from sustainably sourced tropical hardwood, each of which has a private plunge pool 
and sea views from the covered terraces.
The Kempinski group's Cabrits Resort, a five-star beach hotel surrounded by the tropical forest of Cabrits National 
Park, opened in October 2019 while the Anichi Resort, part of Marriott's Autograph collection, is due to open in 
2020.
ALBANIA "Montenegro was the star of 2019 but the whole region is on the rise," says Jonny Bealby of Wild 
Frontiers, who reports bookings for 2020 up 15 per cent compared with the same point a year ago. "Visitors are 
drawn to the mountains, canyons and rivers, the sparkling coastline, ancient towns, Greek and Roman ruins, 
Ottoman citadels and rural hospitality."
Trekkers are finding the Accursed Mountains in the north of the country - off limits during the country's years of 
communist isolationism and during the Kosovo war - offer an alternative to the Alps with almost no-tourist 
development. Meanwhile, historical tours are taking growing numbers beyond the Unesco World Heritage site of 
Butrint to explore the numerous Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman sites throughout the country. And, on a totally 
different note, the Kala music festival, a week-long seaside party on the southern coast at Dhërmi, is putting Albania 
on the map for young travellers, in the same way events such as the Garden, Outlook and Sonus festivals did for 
Croatia.
It is a measure of the Albanian authorities' enthusiasm for tourism that prime minister Edi Rama attended the first 
Kala festival in 2018. "People think of it as a place where you get robbed or killed," Rama told a poolside press 
conference, The Guardian reported. "But the stigma has helped us. When someone visits and gets out alive, they 
realise it's paradise!" The figures appear to back him up: foreign visitor numbers for the first 11 months of 2019 
topped 6.1m, up 8.3 per cent on the same period in 2018, and up from 1.9m for the full year of 2009.
Where I'm going: Sara Wheeler I'm looking to my next book and I'd like to go somewhere I can sit still for a while 
and just explore a small area. I've always liked America and Americans so I'm going to spend a year in the Bronx. It 
will be a book in four sections, following the four seasons. I'm thinking of starting in February.
The Bronx is 40 sq miles, and there are 160 languages spoken there. Having gone out into the world in the past, I'm 
planning to let the world come to me. I've been to the Bronx briefly twice, and I liked it, but I don't know anybody 
there. I've got somewhere half organised to stay - I'm going to rent a room in someone's house - and then I plan to 
just move around and get to know the area.
There's a really interesting history to the Bronx, loads of interesting people came from there and it'll be election year 
too, so I don't think I'll be short of topics or stories. But it is being able to walk a few miles and hear so many 
languages that really appeals to me.
Sara Wheeler's latest book is 'Mud and Stars: Travels in Russia with Pushkin and Other Geniuses of the Golden 
Age' (Jonathan Cape) Where I'm going: Levison Wood The journey I'm really excited about next summer is a road 
trip from Alaska to California. I'll be in Alaska in August giving a talk on board the QE2 and I've given myself a 
couple of weeks in between jobs to travel down the west coast of Canada and the US to San Francisco before I 
head to the Burning Man festival with some friends.
I've been to California before, but never seen the rest of the west coast so I'm looking forward to exploring, 
particularly Oregon and the Rockies and seeing Mount Washington in the flesh, spotting bears and experiencing 
some real wilderness.
Levison Wood's latest book is 'Arabia: A Journey Through The Heart of the Middle East' (Hodder & Stoughton) 
Where I'm going: Jason Webster There are places I've visited which, in a curious way, I still feel I haven't actually

been to, haven't quite absorbed or connected with. Equally, there are cities and countries I have yet to travel to 
which I feel I already know, indeed are somehow a part of me.
The two most important of these for me are Istanbul and Buenos Aires. I'm saving Buenos Aires - where I plan to 
commune with the spirit of Borges and have dreams of becoming a gaucho - for a future date (ie when there's more 
cash). So for 2020 it's Istanbul.
My long-standing fascination with Spain stems in large part from the country's experience of being a point of contact 
between East and West. Istanbul shares this, if at the other end of the Mediterranean.
So while I see myself there exploring the usual sites, it's more about picking something up - an energy, an 
aesthetic, a harmonic - which seems to be produced when different cultures rub together in a particular way.

Kyrgyzstan to the Turkish city of Bursa, making it far easier for international visitors to watch events including 
kokboru, a sort of central Asian equivalent of rugby, with competitors on horseback and a headless goat in place of 
a ball (the date for the event has yet to be announced). In the far east, the ancient archaeological sites of Upper 
Mesopotamia are attracting growing interest, with numerous operators offering expert-led group tours. Meanwhile 
skiers in search of perfect powder and a complete absence of crowds are travelling to Turkey Heliski's base in 
Ayder, close to the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea, where visitors this winter are expected to include the star 
Swiss free-rider Sam Anthamatten.
JAPAN Data from eDreams ODIGEO, which claims to be Europe's biggest online travel agency, suggests a surge 
in the number of European travellers heading to Tokyo in 2020. Across its various websites, forward bookings are 
up 90 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. There is one obvious reason: the Olympics and 
Paralympics, due to take place in late July and early August. Some estimates suggest the Games might attract an 
additional 10m visitors, and there has been a rush of hotel openings in expectation.
Tourism in the country is already Where I'm going: Iain Sinclair In 2020, my travelling is likely to focus on 
somewhere I've not really been at all - north-east Scotland and the Orkneys.
Most of my travelling in the past has been in the orbit of London, but unusually for me I've been in Peru this year 
[2019] on something of a ghost hunt to research my next book. I was following an expedition that my great-
grandfather made in 1891 and wrote about and left a map of. Now I'm examining the territory he came from, and 
was forced to leave during the time of the Highland Clearances.
I need to visit places like Banff and Forres in north-east Scotland and ultimately the Orkney Islands to track him 
down. I'll be up there for a few weeks, around April, May, June, and of all the places I intend to visit, Orkney is 
probably the most romantic; it pushes back to the origins of life in these islands. I'm very keen to look at those 
ancient settlements. But from Aberdeen on, it'll all be new and strange to me.

panel of tourism industry leaders pick the hottest des....
Iain Sinclair's latest books are 'The Last London' (Oneworld) and 'Living with Buildings' (Wellcome Collection) Next 
year my boyfriend and I are going to live in Georgia for six months. We'll be based in Tbilisi, and the idea is to 
explore the lesser known creases and folds of the Caucasus Mountains. I'm particularly looking forward to 
discovering the Racha region in the north-west.
I've been to the country maybe four or five times. I don't normally go back to places, but I love the food, the wine 
and the vivaciousness of the people.
Generally, I'm trying to fly less - and I no longer fly for personal journeys. I've been on expeditions in the past using 
tuk tuks and motorbikes, but this time we've got a very boring Subaru 4x4 for the mountains and we're going to 
drive from the UK, going through Turkey and Bulgaria - stopping off for a bit of skiing - on our way to Georgia.
I have started really thinking about how I travel. I went on holiday recently by train to the south of France from 
Bristol. People often think if you stop flying it means you stop travelling - but that's not the case. It makes you think 
in a different way; overland travel is so rewarding. You see so much more; it's a much deeper way of travelling.
Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent's latest book is 'Land of the Dawn-lit Mountains' (Simon & Schuster) soaring: 31.2m 
foreign travellers visited in 2018, up from 8.6m in 2010. In 2016 the government set a target of reaching 40m 
visitors by 2020, and 60m by 2030. The downside has been the concentration of visitors in the honeypot sites of 
Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, something the national tourist office has tried to counter with publicity campaigns 
promoting lesser-known regions, and which should be helped by new flight routes including, for example, Finnair's 
direct service to Sapporo, on the northern island of Hokkaido, which launched last month.
"Quite apart from the Olympics, Japan is increasingly on the radar of those seeking alternative, experiential travel 
and a completely unhomogenised cultural identity," says George Morgan-Grenville. of Red Savannah.
He suggests 2020 hotspots will include the Samurai districts of Kanazawa, the scenic coastline of Noto, and the art 
museums of Naoshima Island.
URUGUAY "Uruguay has always been considered a seasonal destination, but is just as special outside the 
December/January rush," says Harry Hastings of Plan South America. "It's ideal for 'slow travel', with cycling and 
riding trips through olive groves, vineyards, fishing villages and the open farmland of the south, stopping for sea 
swims, picnics, wine tasting and visits to artists' studios."
Home to fewer than 3.5m people, the country has long been in the shadow of its neighbours, Brazil and Argentina, 
with only the sceney seaside resorts of Punta del Este and José Ignacio attracting much international attention, and 
even then only in summer. Now, though, small numbers of visitors are beginning to look beyond those hotspots, to 
the remote beaches of Rocha state, the surfer hang-out of La Pedrera, the old Portuguese city of Colonia del 
Sacramento and sleepy Carmelo, surrounded by vineyards, wineries and tasting rooms and known by some as 
South America's answer to Tuscany. Visitors should explore rich, full-bodied reds made with Tannat grapes, 
produced from vines descended from cuttings across the Atlantic in the 19th century before phylloxera devastated 
the originals in southern France.
DOMINICA The mountainous Caribbean island has staged a remarkable recovery from the devastation of 
Hurricane Maria in 2017, while promotional campaigns billing it as "the nature island" seem more in tune with the 
times than some of its glitzier neighbours.
Rather than white sands and smart restaurants, the draw here is the pristine rainforests, remote mountain gorges 
and waterfalls. The tourist board is keen to distinguish it as a place for adventure travellers and in particular as a 
place for hiking: the country is home to the longest walking route in the Caribbean, the 185km Waitukubuli trail and 
a system of free "hike passports" was introduced in 2019 for visitors to record their walks. The government has 
been working to restore trails damaged in the hurricane, while also introducing a string of environmental policies 
(plastic straws and cutlery were banned last year; plastic bags are due to be banned outright in 2020).

While eco-tourism remains the focus, the accommodation options are moving increasingly upmarket. Secret Bay, a 
glorious clifftop retreat that closed when the hurricane struck, reopened in November 2018 with major upgrades. It 
now comprises six villas built from sustainably sourced tropical hardwood, each of which has a private plunge pool 
and sea views from the covered terraces.
The Kempinski group's Cabrits Resort, a five-star beach hotel surrounded by the tropical forest of Cabrits National 
Park, opened in October 2019 while the Anichi Resort, part of Marriott's Autograph collection, is due to open in 
2020.
ALBANIA "Montenegro was the star of 2019 but the whole region is on the rise," says Jonny Bealby of Wild 
Frontiers, who reports bookings for 2020 up 15 per cent compared with the same point a year ago. "Visitors are 
drawn to the mountains, canyons and rivers, the sparkling coastline, ancient towns, Greek and Roman ruins, 
Ottoman citadels and rural hospitality."
Trekkers are finding the Accursed Mountains in the north of the country - off limits during the country's years of 
communist isolationism and during the Kosovo war - offer an alternative to the Alps with almost no-tourist 
development. Meanwhile, historical tours are taking growing numbers beyond the Unesco World Heritage site of 
Butrint to explore the numerous Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman sites throughout the country. And, on a totally 
different note, the Kala music festival, a week-long seaside party on the southern coast at Dhërmi, is putting Albania 
on the map for young travellers, in the same way events such as the Garden, Outlook and Sonus festivals did for 
Croatia.
It is a measure of the Albanian authorities' enthusiasm for tourism that prime minister Edi Rama attended the first 
Kala festival in 2018. "People think of it as a place where you get robbed or killed," Rama told a poolside press 
conference, The Guardian reported. "But the stigma has helped us. When someone visits and gets out alive, they 
realise it's paradise!" The figures appear to back him up: foreign visitor numbers for the first 11 months of 2019 
topped 6.1m, up 8.3 per cent on the same period in 2018, and up from 1.9m for the full year of 2009.
Where I'm going: Sara Wheeler I'm looking to my next book and I'd like to go somewhere I can sit still for a while 
and just explore a small area. I've always liked America and Americans so I'm going to spend a year in the Bronx. It 
will be a book in four sections, following the four seasons. I'm thinking of starting in February.
The Bronx is 40 sq miles, and there are 160 languages spoken there. Having gone out into the world in the past, I'm 
planning to let the world come to me. I've been to the Bronx briefly twice, and I liked it, but I don't know anybody 
there. I've got somewhere half organised to stay - I'm going to rent a room in someone's house - and then I plan to 
just move around and get to know the area.
There's a really interesting history to the Bronx, loads of interesting people came from there and it'll be election year 
too, so I don't think I'll be short of topics or stories. But it is being able to walk a few miles and hear so many 
languages that really appeals to me.
Sara Wheeler's latest book is 'Mud and Stars: Travels in Russia with Pushkin and Other Geniuses of the Golden 
Age' (Jonathan Cape) Where I'm going: Levison Wood The journey I'm really excited about next summer is a road 
trip from Alaska to California. I'll be in Alaska in August giving a talk on board the QE2 and I've given myself a 
couple of weeks in between jobs to travel down the west coast of Canada and the US to San Francisco before I 
head to the Burning Man festival with some friends.
I've been to California before, but never seen the rest of the west coast so I'm looking forward to exploring, 
particularly Oregon and the Rockies and seeing Mount Washington in the flesh, spotting bears and experiencing 
some real wilderness.
Levison Wood's latest book is 'Arabia: A Journey Through The Heart of the Middle East' (Hodder & Stoughton) 
Where I'm going: Jason Webster There are places I've visited which, in a curious way, I still feel I haven't actually

been to, haven't quite absorbed or connected with. Equally, there are cities and countries I have yet to travel to 
which I feel I already know, indeed are somehow a part of me.
The two most important of these for me are Istanbul and Buenos Aires. I'm saving Buenos Aires - where I plan to 
commune with the spirit of Borges and have dreams of becoming a gaucho - for a future date (ie when there's more 
cash). So for 2020 it's Istanbul.
My long-standing fascination with Spain stems in large part from the country's experience of being a point of contact 
between East and West. Istanbul shares this, if at the other end of the Mediterranean.
So while I see myself there exploring the usual sites, it's more about picking something up - an energy, an 
aesthetic, a harmonic - which seems to be produced when different cultures rub together in a particular way.

ARMENIA Georgia has enjoyed soaring visitor numbers, and a string of new airline routes, since it was tipped in the 
equivalent of this article two years ago. Visits by international tourists during the first 11 months of 2019 were up 
19.4 per cent compared with the same period in 2017. Meanwhile its southern neighbour Armenia has remained 
relatively off the radar - attracting fewer than a quarter of Georgia's visitor numbers - though that now seems to be 
on the verge of change. Four members of our panel picked Armenia as one to watch in 2020 (Wild Frontiers says 
its forward bookings are up 100 per cent compared with a year go) and the country will get its first low-cost airline 
links with western Europe. Ryanair, Wizz and Air Baltic are all due to launch flights, connecting the capital Yerevan 
with cities including Milan, Rome, Berlin and Vienna.
The main draw for visitors is the country's extraordinary collection of medieval monasteries and churches, many of 
them set among dramatic mountains. Geghard monastery, for example, was cut into the rock of the Upper Azat 
valley and was completed in the 13th century. It is now a Unesco world heritage site, as are the monasteries at 
Haghpat and Sanahin. But Yerevan and the wine-lands are also fascinating. "Yerevan is one of the region's most 
exuberant and endearing cities," says Justin Wateridge of Steppes Travel. "Both country and capital are an 
unexpected delight that you need to discover before the secret gets out."

Tom Marchant of Black Tomato recommends the newly opened Alexander hotel in Yerevan, part of Marriott's 
Luxury Collection, as well as stopping for a degustation at the Ararat Brandy Company.
CHAD For travellers who really want to get off the beaten track, Chad is ideal. More than five times the size of the 
UK, the entire country gets fewer visitors in a year than Tate Modern gets in a week. And that is despite glorious 
desert and mountain scenery, fascinating ancient rock art and the closest "big five" safari park to Europe.
The bad news is that there is a reason for such a dearth of visitors: the UK Foreign Office advises against "all but 
essential" travel to most of the country, and "all travel" to the rest, highlighting the potential risk of crime and 
terrorism; the US State Department suggests potential visitors "reconsider".
Despite that, several tour operators tip it as a rising destination for the coming year, a recommendation that is 
largely down to the work of African Parks, a South African-based non-profit conservation organisation. In 2010 it 
was invited by the Chadian government to sign a long-term agreement to manage Zakouma National Park, a 1,200 
sq mile park in the south-east of the country that had been ransacked by horseback-riding poaching gangs. With 
the help of EU funding, African Parks restored security (elephant deaths fell from 4,000 in the eight years to 2010, 
to just 24 since then), opened 17 schools and created employment at the three tourist camps. In 2017, the 
government put an expanded area around the park into African Parks control, then in February 2018 the 
organisation was given responsibility for the Ennedi Natural and Cultural Reserve, a 15,500 sq mile expanse of 
sandstone mountains in the north of the country, filled with dramatic canyons, cliffs and arches as well as rock art 
that dates back 7,000 years. "Declared a World Heritage Site in 2016, the Ennedi is a vast wilderness with a 
savage beauty," says Will Jones of Journeys By Design.
"Exploring it using private mobile camps, then transferring to Zakouma is an extraordinary combination." Alice 
Daunt says she will be visiting this year "for its deserts, nomadic people, rock art and formations" but also thanks to 
"a chance encounter with a London Uber driver from N'Djamena."UK Britain maybe preparing to leave the EU in 
2020, but the British national tourism agency is predicting a record year. Visit Britain says international tourist 
numbers will hit 39.7m, the highest ever and almost 5 per cent up on 2018. Particularly important to the growth are 
emerging tourism markets in the east - Visit Britain's data shows flight bookings to the UK for the first half of the 
year are up 33 per cent from China, and 22 per cent from south europe.
While the reduced value of sterling has helped make the UK cheaper, the big draw this year is likely to be the 
country's literary and artistic heritage. 2020 is the 250th anniversary of William Wordsworth's birth (marked by a 
£6.2m project to expand the museum at his former home, Dove Cottage at Grasmere in the Lake District) and the 
150th anniversary of Charles Dicken's death (with a five-day festival in Rochester among many others). Meanwhile 
the lack of a significant anniversary does not seem to have deterred Jane Austen fans: a 10-day festival is planned 
in Bath in September, there is a nine-day festival in Hampshire in June, and yet another film version of Emma is 
due for release in February, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and a string of fabulous stately homes.
Meanwhile, a Game of Thrones Studio Tour is due to open in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, this spring and 
Glastonbury celebrates its 50th anniversary with headliners including Paul McCartney and Diana Ross.
NORWAY A growing awareness of climate change has brought the Arctic regions to the forefront of many minds. 
On one hand, the vulnerability of the ice caps, wildlife and traditional ways of life inspires an increasingly emotional 
reaction - the endangered glaciers pitied in the same way as the elephants and rhinos of east Africa. On the other, 
in a warming world, spending a summer holiday somewhere cold rather than hot seems increasingly attractive. 
Above all, the Arctic has become so much more visible: consider, for example, that in 48 hours over Christmas, the 
BBC's output included radio broadcasts from Greenland and Iceland, a two-hour "slow TV" programme following a 
Sami sleigh ride through Arctic Norway, and a film about the disappearing skills of the Inuit, "an elegy to the world 
that is melting away". Even Hollywood is leveraging the appeal of the north: Disney's new children's movie Frozen 2 
draws heavily on Sami culture, myths and landscapes while the forthcoming James Bond movie No Time to Die, out 
in April, includes snowy sequences filmed in Norway.

While countries across the north are experiencing growing visitor numbers, Norway is especially well placed to 
benefit, with infrastructure that makes it straightforward to reach the Arctic, and an abundance of fjords, mountains 
and islands. Set among them are a growing number of landmark architectural projects by the Oslo-based practice 
Snohetta, a master at creating buildings that manage to be both appropriate to the stark beauty of their 
surroundings as well as catnip for social media. Among them are Europe's first underwater restaurant, launched in 
March 2019, the National Opera house in Oslo, a remote pavilion for watching passing reindeer at Hjerkinn, and the 
forthcoming Svart, a circular hotel just above the Arctic Circle, which isn't due to open until 2022 but is already 
generating a buzz.
"Interest in all things Nordic continues to grow," says Georgina Hancock at Discover the World, who tips Senja 
Island, to the west of Tromso, as "a quieter, under-explored alternative to the well-trodden Lofoten Islands". At Red 
Savannah, George Morgan-Grenville reports forward bookings for Norway up 33 per cent compared with this point 
a year ago. Both agree about the appeal of Svalbard, which in 2020 marks 100 years of Norwegian sovereignty, 
and offers the chance to visit the world's northernmost city, school, museum, piano and much more. "Nowhere is 
more wild," says Morgan-Grenville.
TURKEY Tourism in Turkey collapsed in 2015 and 2016 in response to terrorist attacks and political instability, with 
visitor numbers falling almost 40 per cent.
Those security fears have now eased, and tourist numbers are rebounding - helped by a significant devaluation of 
the lira (a euro currently buys about 6.6 Turkish lira, up from about 2 lira a decade ago). That exchange rate has 
made city breaks more affordable in Istanbul, with its constantly expanding roster of luxury hotels. Recent additions 
include Sofitel on Taksim square, which opened in November complete with 33 Hermésdesigned suites) and the 
Six Senses Kocatas Mansions, which soft-launched the same month, housed in two 19thcentury mansions and with 
far-reaching views over the Bosphorus.
The longer term trend, however, is for adventure-seeking tourists to look beyond Istanbul and the Mediterranean 
seaside resorts. Steppes highlight the move of the World Nomad Games this year from a remote yurt village in 
Kyrgyzstan to the Turkish city of Bursa, making it far easier for international visitors to watch events including 
kokboru, a sort of central europen equivalent of rugby, with competitors on horseback and a headless goat in place 
of a ball (the date for the event has yet to be announced). In the far east, the ancient archaeological sites of Upper 
Mesopotamia are attracting growing interest, with numerous operators offering expert-led group tours. Meanwhile 
skiers in search of perfect powder and a complete absence of crowds are travelling to Turkey Heliski's base in 
Ayder, close to the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea, where visitors this winter are expected to include the star 
Swiss free-rider Sam Anthamatten.
JAPAN Data from eDreams ODIGEO, which claims to be Europe's biggest online travel agency, suggests a surge 
in the number of European travellers heading to Tokyo in 2020. Across its various websites, forward bookings are 
up 90 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. There is one obvious reason: the Olympics and 
Paralympics, due to take place in late July and early August. Some estimates suggest the Games might attract an 
additional 10m visitors, and there has been a rush of hotel openings in expectation.

topped 6.1m, up 8.3 per cent on the same period in 2018, and up from 1.9m for the full year of 2009.
Where I'm going: Sara Wheeler I'm looking to my next book and I'd like to go somewhere I can sit still for a while 
and just explore a small area. I've always liked America and Americans so I'm going to spend a year in the Bronx. It 
will be a book in four sections, following the four seasons. I'm thinking of starting in February.
The Bronx is 40 sq miles, and there are 160 languages spoken there. Having gone out into the world in the past, I'm 
planning to let the world come to me. I've been to the Bronx briefly twice, and I liked it, but I don't know anybody 
there. I've got somewhere half organised to stay - I'm going to rent a room in someone's house - and then I plan to 
just move around and get to know the area.
There's a really interesting history to the Bronx, loads of interesting people came from there and it'll be election year 
too, so I don't think I'll be short of topics or stories. But it is being able to walk a few miles and hear so many 
languages that really appeals to me.
Sara Wheeler's latest book is 'Mud and Stars: Travels in Russia with Pushkin and Other Geniuses of the Golden 
Age' (Jonathan Cape) Where I'm going: Levison Wood The journey I'm really excited about next summer is a road 
trip from Alaska to California. I'll be in Alaska in August giving a talk on board the QE2 and I've given myself a 
couple of weeks in between jobs to travel down the west coast of Canada and the US to San Francisco before I 
head to the Burning Man festival with some friends.
I've been to California before, but never seen the rest of the west coast so I'm looking forward to exploring, 
particularly Oregon and the Rockies and seeing Mount Washington in the flesh, spotting bears and experiencing 
some real wilderness.
Levison Wood's latest book is 'Arabia: A Journey Through The Heart of the Middle East' (Hodder & Stoughton)

which I feel I already know, indeed are somehow a part of me.
The two most important of these for me are Istanbul and Buenos Aires. I'm saving Buenos Aires - where I plan to 
commune with the spirit of Borges and have dreams of becoming a gaucho - for a future date (ie when there's more

My long-standing fascination with Spain stems in large part from the country's experience of being a point of contact 
between East and West. Istanbul shares this, if at the other end of the Mediterranean.
So while I see myself there exploring the usual sites, it's more about picking something up - an energy, an 
aesthetic, a harmonic - which seems to be produced when different cultures rub together in a particular way.

ARMENIA
Georgia has enjoyed soaring visitor numbers, and a string of new airline routes, since it was tipped in the equivalent 
of this article two years ago. Visits by international tourists during the first 11 months of 2019 were up 19.4 per cent 
compared with the same period in 2017. Meanwhile its southern neighbour Armenia has remained relatively off the 
radar - attracting fewer than a quarter of Georgia's visitor numbers - though that now seems to be on the verge of 
change. Four members of our panel picked Armenia as one to watch in 2020 (Wild Frontiers says its forward 
bookings are up 100 per cent compared with a year go) and the country will get its first low-cost airline links with 
western Europe. Ryanair, Wizz and Air Baltic are all due to launch flights, connecting the capital Yerevan with cities 
including Milan, Rome, Berlin and Vienna.
The main draw for visitors is the country's extraordinary collection of medieval monasteries and churches, many of 
them set among dramatic mountains. Geghard monastery, for example, was cut into the rock of the Upper Azat 
valley and was completed in the 13th century. It is now a Unesco world heritage site, as are the monasteries at 
Haghpat and Sanahin. But Yerevan and the wine-lands are also fascinating. "Yerevan is one of the region's most 
exuberant and endearing cities," says Justin Wateridge of Steppes Travel. "Both country and capital are an 
unexpected delight that you need to discover before the secret gets out."

Tom Marchant of Black Tomato recommends the newly opened Alexander hotel in Yerevan, part of Marriott's 
Luxury Collection, as well as stopping for a degustation at the Ararat Brandy Company.
CHAD
For travellers who really want to get off the beaten track, Chad is ideal. More than five times the size of the UK, the 
entire country gets fewer visitors in a year than Tate Modern gets in a week. And that is despite glorious desert and 
mountain scenery, fascinating ancient rock art and the closest "big five" safari park to Europe.
The bad news is that there is a reason for such a dearth of visitors: the UK Foreign Office advises against "all but 
essential" travel to most of the country, and "all travel" to the rest, highlighting the potential risk of crime and 
terrorism; the US State Department suggests potential visitors "reconsider".
Despite that, several tour operators tip it as a rising destination for the coming year, a recommendation that is 
largely down to the work of African Parks, a South African-based non-profit conservation organisation. In 2010 it 
was invited by the Chadian government to sign a long-term agreement to manage Zakouma National Park, a 1,200 
sq mile park in the south-east of the country that had been ransacked by horseback-riding poaching gangs. With 
the help of EU funding, African Parks restored security (elephant deaths fell from 4,000 in the eight years to 2010, 
to just 24 since then), opened 17 schools and created employment at the three tourist camps. In 2017, the 
government put an expanded area around the park into African Parks control, then in February 2018 the 
organisation was given responsibility for the Ennedi Natural and Cultural Reserve, a 15,500 sq mile expanse of 
sandstone mountains in the north of the country, filled with dramatic canyons, cliffs and arches as well as rock art 
that dates back 7,000 years. "Declared a World Heritage Site in 2016, the Ennedi is a vast wilderness with a 
savage beauty," says Will Jones of Journeys By Design.
"Exploring it using private mobile camps, then transferring to Zakouma is an extraordinary combination." Alice 
Daunt says she will be visiting this year "for its deserts, nomadic people, rock art and formations" but also thanks to 
"a chance encounter with a London Uber driver from N'Djamena."UK
Britain may be preparing to leave the EU in 2020, but the British national tourism agency is predicting a record year. 
Visit Britain says international tourist numbers will hit 39.7m, the highest ever and almost 5 per cent up on 2018. 
Particularly important to the growth are emerging tourism markets in the east - Visit Britain's data shows flight 
bookings to the UK for the first half of the year are up 33 per cent from China, and 22 per cent from south Asia.
While the reduced value of sterling has helped make the UK cheaper, the big draw this year is likely to be the 
country's literary and artistic heritage. 2020 is the 250th anniversary of William Wordsworth's birth (marked by a 
£6.2m project to expand the museum at his former home, Dove Cottage at Grasmere in the Lake District) and the 
150th anniversary of Charles Dicken's death (with a five-day festival in Rochester among many others). Meanwhile 
the lack of a significant anniversary does not seem to have deterred Jane Austen fans: a 10-day festival is planned 
in Bath in September, there is a nine-day festival in Hampshire in June, and yet another film version of Emma is 
due for release in February, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and a string of fabulous stately homes.
Meanwhile, a Game of Thrones Studio Tour is due to open in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, this spring and 
Glastonbury celebrates its 50th anniversary with headliners including Paul McCartney and Diana Ross.
NORWAY A growing awareness of climate change has brought the Arctic regions to the forefront of many minds. 
On one hand, the vulnerability of the ice caps, wildlife and traditional ways of life inspires an increasingly emotional 
reaction - the endangered glaciers pitied in the same way as the elephants and rhinos of east Africa. On the other, 
in a warming world, spending a summer holiday somewhere cold rather than hot seems increasingly attractive. 
Above all, the Arctic has become so much more visible: consider, for example, that in 48 hours over Christmas, the 
BBC's output included radio broadcasts from Greenland and Iceland, a two-hour "slow TV" programme following a 
Sami sleigh ride through Arctic Norway, and a film about the disappearing skills of the Inuit, "an elegy to the world 
that is melting away". Even Hollywood is leveraging the appeal of the north: Disney's new children's movie Frozen 2

draws heavily on Sami culture, myths and landscapes while the forthcoming James Bond movie No Time to Die, out 
in April, includes snowy sequences filmed in Norway.
While countries across the north are experiencing growing visitor numbers, Norway is especially well placed to 
benefit, with infrastructure that makes it straightforward to reach the Arctic, and an abundance of fjords, mountains 
and islands. Set among them are a growing number of landmark architectural projects by the Oslo-based practice 
Snohetta, a master at creating buildings that manage to be both appropriate to the stark beauty of their 
surroundings as well as catnip for social media. Among them are Europe's first underwater restaurant, launched in 
March 2019, the National Opera house in Oslo, a remote pavilion for watching passing reindeer at Hjerkinn, and the 
forthcoming Svart, a circular hotel just above the Arctic Circle, which isn't due to open until 2022 but is already 
generating a buzz.
"Interest in all things Nordic continues to grow," says Georgina Hancock at Discover the World, who tips Senja 
Island, to the west of Tromso, as "a quieter, under-explored alternative to the well-trodden Lofoten Islands". At Red 
Savannah, George Morgan-Grenville reports forward bookings for Norway up 33 per cent compared with this point 
a year ago. Both agree about the appeal of Svalbard, which in 2020 marks 100 years of Norwegian sovereignty, 
and offers the chance to visit the world's northernmost city, school, museum, piano and much more. "Nowhere is 
more wild," says Morgan-Grenville.
TURKEY Tourism in Turkey collapsed in 2015 and 2016 in response to terrorist attacks and political instability, with 
visitor numbers falling almost 40 per cent.
Those security fears have now eased, and tourist numbers are rebounding - helped by a significant devaluation of 
the lira (a euro currently buys about 6.6 Turkish lira, up from about 2 lira a decade ago). That exchange rate has 
made city breaks more affordable in Istanbul, with its constantly expanding roster of luxury hotels. Recent additions 
include Sofitel on Taksim square, which opened in November complete with 33 Hermésdesigned suites) and the 
Six Senses Kocatas Mansions, which soft-launched the same month, housed in two 19thcentury mansions and with 
far-reaching views over the Bosphorus.
The longer term trend, however, is for adventure-seeking tourists to look beyond Istanbul and the Mediterranean 
seaside resorts. Steppes highlight the move of the World Nomad Games this year from a remote yurt village in 
Kyrgyzstan to the Turkish city of Bursa, making it far easier for international visitors to watch events including 
kokboru, a sort of central Asian equivalent of rugby, with competitors on horseback and a headless goat in place of 
a ball (the date for the event has yet to be announced). In the far east, the ancient archaeological sites of Upper 
Mesopotamia are attracting growing interest, with numerous operators offering expert-led group tours. Meanwhile 
skiers in search of perfect powder and a complete absence of crowds are travelling to Turkey Heliski's base in 
Ayder, close to the south-eastern shore of the Black Sea, where visitors this winter are expected to include the star 
Swiss free-rider Sam Anthamatten.
JAPAN Data from eDreams ODIGEO, which claims to be Europe's biggest online travel agency, suggests a surge 
in the number of European travellers heading to Tokyo in 2020. Across its various websites, forward bookings are 
up 90 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. There is one obvious reason: the Olympics and 
Paralympics, due to take place in late July and early August. Some estimates suggest the Games might attract an 
additional 10m visitors, and there has been a rush of hotel openings in expectation.
Tourism in the country is already Where I'm going: Iain Sinclair In 2020, my travelling is likely to focus on 
somewhere I've not really been at all - north-east Scotland and the Orkneys.
Most of my travelling in the past has been in the orbit of London, but unusually for me I've been in Peru this year 
[2019] on something of a ghost hunt to research my next book. I was following an expedition that my great-
grandfather made in 1891 and wrote about and left a map of. Now I'm examining the territory he came from, and 
was forced to leave during the time of the Highland Clearances.
Where to go in 2020 From Armenia to the snows of Svalbard - our panel of tourism industry leaders pick the 
hottest destinations for the coming year. Plus five t....
I need to visit places like Banff and Forres in north-east Scotland and ultimately the Orkney Islands to track him 
down. I'll be up there for a few weeks, around April, May, June, and of all the places I intend to visit, Orkney is 
probably the most romantic; it pushes back to the origins of life in these islands. I'm very keen to look at those 
ancient settlements. But from Aberdeen on, it'll all be new and strange to me.
Iain Sinclair's latest books are 'The Last London' (Oneworld) and 'Living with Buildings' (Wellcome Collection) Next 
year my boyfriend and I are going to live in Georgia for six months. We'll be based in Tbilisi, and the idea is to 
explore the lesser known creases and folds of the Caucasus Mountains. I'm particularly looking forward to 
discovering the Racha region in the north-west.
I've been to the country maybe four or five times. I don't normally go back to places, but I love the food, the wine 
and the vivaciousness of the people.
Generally, I'm trying to fly less - and I no longer fly for personal journeys. I've been on expeditions in the past using 
tuk tuks and motorbikes, but this time we've got a very boring Subaru 4x4 for the mountains and we're going to 
drive from the UK, going through Turkey and Bulgaria - stopping off for a bit of skiing - on our way to Georgia.
I have started really thinking about how I travel. I went on holiday recently by train to the south of France from 
Bristol. People often think if you stop flying it means you stop travelling - but that's not the case. It makes you think 
in a different way; overland travel is so rewarding. You see so much more; it's a much deeper way of travelling.
Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent's latest book is 'Land of the Dawn-lit Mountains' (Simon & Schuster) soaring: 31.2m 
foreign travellers visited in 2018, up from 8.6m in 2010. In 2016 the government set a target of reaching 40m 
visitors by 2020, and 60m by 2030. The downside has been the concentration of visitors in the honeypot sites of 
Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, something the national tourist office has tried to counter with publicity campaigns 
promoting lesser-known regions, and which should be helped by new flight routes including, for example, Finnair's 
direct service to Sapporo, on the northern island of Hokkaido, which launched last month.
"Quite apart from the Olympics, Japan is increasingly on the radar of those seeking alternative, experiential travel 
and a completely unhomogenised cultural identity," says George Morgan-Grenville. of Red Savannah.
He suggests 2020 hotspots will include the Samurai districts of Kanazawa, the scenic coastline of Noto, and the art 
museums of Naoshima Island.
URUGUAY "Uruguay has always been considered a seasonal destination, but is just as special outside the 
December/January rush," says Harry Hastings of Plan South America. "It's ideal for 'slow travel', with cycling and 
riding trips through olive groves, vineyards, fishing villages and the open farmland of the south, stopping for sea 
swims, picnics, wine tasting and visits to artists' studios."
Home to fewer than 3.5m people, the country has long been in the shadow of its neighbours, Brazil and Argentina, 
with only the sceney seaside resorts of Punta del Este and José Ignacio attracting much international attention, and 
even then only in summer. Now, though, small numbers of visitors are beginning to look beyond those hotspots, to 
the remote beaches of Rocha state, the surfer hang-out of La Pedrera, the old Portuguese city of Colonia del 
Sacramento and sleepy Carmelo, surrounded by vineyards, wineries and tasting rooms and known by some as 
South America's answer to Tuscany. Visitors should explore rich, full-bodied reds made with Tannat grapes, 
produced from vines descended from cuttings across the Atlantic in the 19th century before phylloxera devastated 
the originals in southern France.
DOMINICA The mountainous Caribbean island has staged a remarkable recovery from the devastation of 
Hurricane Maria in 2017, while promotional campaigns billing it as "the nature island" seem more in tune with the 
times than some of its glitzier neighbours.
Rather than white sands and smart restaurants, the draw here is the pristine rainforests, remote mountain gorges 
and waterfalls. The tourist board is keen to distinguish it as a place for adventure travellers and in particular as a

place for hiking: the country is home to the longest walking route in the Caribbean, the 185km Waitukubuli trail and 
a system of free "hike passports" was introduced in 2019 for visitors to record their walks. The government has 
been working to restore trails damaged in the hurricane, while also introducing a string of environmental policies 
(plastic straws and cutlery were banned last year; plastic bags are due to be banned outright in 2020).
While eco-tourism remains the focus, the accommodation options are moving increasingly upmarket. Secret Bay, a 
glorious clifftop retreat that closed when the hurricane struck, reopened in November 2018 with major upgrades. It 
now comprises six villas built from sustainably sourced tropical hardwood, each of which has a private plunge pool 
and sea views from the covered terraces.
The Kempinski group's Cabrits Resort, a five-star beach hotel surrounded by the tropical forest of Cabrits National 
Park, opened in October 2019 while the Anichi Resort, part of Marriott's Autograph collection, is due to open in 
2020.
ALBANIA "Montenegro was the star of 2019 but the whole region is on the rise," says Jonny Bealby of Wild 
Frontiers, who reports bookings for 2020 up 15 per cent compared with the same point a year ago. "Visitors are 
drawn to the mountains, canyons and rivers, the sparkling coastline, ancient towns, Greek and Roman ruins, 
Ottoman citadels and rural hospitality."
Trekkers are finding the Accursed Mountains in the north of the country - off limits during the country's years of 
communist isolationism and during the Kosovo war - offer an alternative to the Alps with almost no-tourist 
development. Meanwhile, historical tours are taking growing numbers beyond the Unesco World Heritage site of 
Butrint to explore the numerous Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman sites throughout the country. And, on a totally 
different note, the Kala music festival, a week-long seaside party on the southern coast at Dhërmi, is putting Albania 
on the map for young travellers, in the same way events such as the Garden, Outlook and Sonus festivals did for 
Croatia.
It is a measure of the Albanian authorities' enthusiasm for tourism that prime minister Edi Rama attended the first 
Kala festival in 2018. "People think of it as a place where you get robbed or killed," Rama told a poolside press 
conference, The Guardian reported. "But the stigma has helped us. When someone visits and gets out alive, they 
realise it's paradise!" The figures appear to back him up: foreign visitor numbers for the first 11 months of 2019 
topped 6.1m, up 8.3 per cent on the same period in 2018, and up from 1.9m for the full year of 2009.

Jan 04, 2020( The Armenian Observer: http://ditord.com Delivered by Newstex)  Zvartnots International Airport's 
yearly passenger flow exceeded 3,000,000 for the first time in its history, Armenpress[1] news agency reports. In 
2018, the passenger flow was 2,690,000. Ryanair opens flights to Athens and Thessaloniki  Meanwhile, on January 
3rd Ryanair budget airline announced[2] new twice weekly routes from Gyumri to Athens and from Yerevan to 
Thessaloniki. 
The flights will start in May 2020 and the tickets are already on sale in Ryanair's mobile app. The Irish carrier 
Ryanair had announced back in October that it will start flying to Yerevan from Milan, Rome and Berlin in January 
and that it will open two more routes in summer. Wizz Air annouces flights to Vienna and Vilnius  In another 
welcome news, the Budapest-based budget airline Wizz Air announced[3] last month that it will open flights to 
Yerevan from Vienna and Vilnius in April. Decreasing cost of airfare and Revazian The high cost of airfare has long 
been cited as one of main obstacles for the development of tourism in Armenia. The cost of air travel has been 
decreasing for several years now, as consecutive Armenian governments have prioritized the issue.  Tatevik 
Revazian as the Chair of Civil Aviation Committee  With the appointment of Tatevik Revazian as the Chair of Civil 
Aviation Committee, things have taken a truly revolutionary turn. The young official, who was initially seen as 
inexperienced and lacking necessary skills to deliver, has since managed to attract two major European budget 
airlines to Armenia and has since become something of a hero, for being able to make promises and deliver.Hence, 
her Facebook post[4] on January 3rd, announcing Ryanair's new flights as well as outlining possible new routs to 
Paris (Transavia), Memmingen (Ryanair) and Riga (Air Baltic), no longer seem far fetched, but rather as something 
that can and will be delivered. [ 1]: https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1000488.html [ 2]:

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) expects the first batch of Boeing (BA) 737 MAX planes to be delivered in the later part 
of 2020, Reuters reported, citing an article from German magazine Wirtschaftswoche.
The Irish budget carrier has ordered 135 of the jets, which were grounded last year after two deadly crashes raised 
concerns about their safety. Last month, Boeing announced that it would temporarily suspend production of the 737 
MAX amid uncertainty on getting regulatory approval for the plane's return to service.
"We were meant to have 58 planes by the summer," CEO Michael O'Leary told the publication. "That went down to 
30, then 20, then 10 and the latest is maybe only five. It's possible we'll only get the first jets in October 2020."

Ryanair is prepared for further delays to the delivery of its Boeing 737 Max airliners, its chief executive Michael 
O'Leary told German magazine Wirtschaftswoche, adding that he would only talk compensation after the aircraft 
had been delivered.
The troubled airliner has been grounded since two crashes, which claimed 346 lives, raised fears about the next-
generation jet's safety. One of the world's largest airlines, Ryanair has ordered 135 of the jets.
"We were meant to have 58 planes by the summer," he said in the interview, extracts from which were published on 
Friday. "That went down to 30, then 20, then 10 and the latest is maybe only five. It's possible we'll only get the first

Railway (CMQ). However, the buyout is pending approval from the Surface Transportation Board in the United 
States.Apart from strengthening the company's presence in eastern United States, the buyout will enhance 
customer experience by providing a smooth, secure and efficient access to ports at Searsport, ME, and to Saint

Jan 02, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
Inc UAL[1] will suspend[2] its nonstop flights between Dayton International Airport (DAY) and George Bush 
Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, TX, with effect from Mar 29, 2020. The termination of the service is due to 
weak demand on the route. Notably, the carrier began service to IAH in June 2018.Nevertheless, United Airlines will 
continue to serve Dayton from its hubs in Chicago, Denver and Washington, DC.The carrier, which has 14 Boeing 
737 MAX jets in their fleet, recently extended the grounding period of the MAX aircraft to Jun 4 (from previously the 
aircraft was grounded through Mar 4). As uncertainty lingers over the controversial aircraft's return to service. 
Consequently, the airline expects to cancel approximately 56 flights a day in January and February. 
As air-travel demand usually picks up in the subsequent months, flight cancellations at United Airlines are expected 
to rise to 80 in March and April as well as 108 in May and early June.Numerous flight cancellations due to 
groundings and the consequent revenue loss have weighed on the company's shares. Thanks to these factors, the 
stock significantly underperformed its industry in a year's time. While the stock gained a mere 4.7%, the industry[3]

A Boeing 777 has clipped the tail of another plane at Toronto airport.
The Air Canada jet, which was being towed at the time, banged the tail of the Airbus A321 aircraft belonging to the 
same carrier.
Video footage shows the 777's left-hand wing hitting the parked narrow-body jet with enough force to spin the 
Airbus aircraft around.
It's understood that both aircraft were unoccupied at the time of the incident.
Toronto Pearson International Airport is the Canadian flag carrier's largest hub. It handles around 50 million 
passengers a year and is the second-busiest airport in North America after New York JFK.
An Air Canada spokesperson told The Independent: "The incident occurred during the towing of a Boeing 777 at 
Toronto-Pearson on December 27, when the aircraft came into contact with a parked Airbus A321 stationed on the 
tarmac, away from the terminal.
"Both aircraft were empty at the time and there were no injuries. We are investigating the incident. The Boeing 777 
has since returned to service and the A321 is being repaired."
It's not the first time two aircraft have collided.
In July, two planes collided at Amsterdam Schiphol airport when an easyJet aircraft crashed into a KLM plane 
during pushback.
Both aircraft were damaged due to the contact.
One passenger onboard the easyJet flight, from Amsterdam to London Gatwick, said the plane's wing was "lodged" 
into the KLM aircraft's tail.
In April, two planes collided during foggy weather at East Midlands airport.
A Ryanair plane clipped a stationary Jet2 aircraft when it was taxiing to the stand at the Derbyshire airport.

No passengers were onboard either aircraft at the time of the incident and no-one was injured.

Avia Solutions Group debuted in the high-yield bond market in the final quarter of last year after closing a $300 
million bond under Rule 144A/Regulation S.   The European aircraft leasing and aviation services company issued 
guaranteed notes at 7.875% on Euronext Dublin.   The five-year senior unsecured notes mature in 2024.    The 
notes were issued by ASG Finance and guaranteed by Avia Solutions, AviaAM Leasing, Baltic Ground Services, 
Chapman Freeborn, FL Technics and SIA Smart Aviation (a holding company for two airline operators, Smartlynx 
and Avion Express).    Law firm Dentons advised Avia Solutions Group in the transaction and acted as English and 
United States counsel to the issuer, Avia Solutions and the other guarantors.   Jonas JanukÄ-nas, chief executive 
officer of Avia Solutions, said: "This bond issue is crucial to our business strategy towards Avia Solutions' continued 
growth and success."   "The issuance reflects Dentons' continuing strength in capital markets transactions in the 
airline and aerospace industry. It builds on our recent work with Ryanair on its EMTN programme and with Air 
Baltic, which became the first airline in Central and Eastern Europe to access the Eurobond market," said Dentons 
debt capital markets partner Nick Hayday.

Abu Dhabi-based Sirius Aviation Capital has closed its first transaction with the purchase of eight narrowbody 
aircraft.
The five Airbus A320s and three Boeing 737-800s are all mid-life aircraft with a market value of approximately $290 
million. The aircraft are on lease to six airlines.
Sirius Aviation Capital did not disclose the identity of the company it purchased the aircraft from, but stated that they 
came from "one of the top 10 aircraft lessors".
"This initial portfolio acquisition is a major step forward for the development of Sirius and we look forward to 
concluding further portfolio acquisitions in 2020," said Edward Coughlan chief commercial officer of Sirius.
The leasing platform, which was established by former Ryanair chief financial officer (CFO) Howard Miller in the 
Gulf state last month, is backed by one of Abu Dhabi's largest sovereign wealth funds, the Mubadala Investment 
Company and the US firm Falcon Edge Capital.
They have invested $100 million through a joint venture company called Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners. As part of the 
partnership Catalyst Partners have acquired a "significant minority stake" in Sirius.

Ryanair has raised its full-year profit guidance based on better Christmas trading, but warned that losses at its 
Lauda subsidiary are expected to grow.
In a trading update, the airline said it should finish the year with profits "close to the mid-point" of (EURO)950 million 
to (EURO)1 billion ($1 billion to $1.1 billion), an increase from previous guidance of (EURO)800 million to 
(EURO)900 million.
The new guidance is the result of "stronger than expected" bookings over the Christmas and New Year travel 
period, characterised by "higher than expected close-in bookings at better than expected yields".
However, Ryanair expects Lauda's losses to rise to (EURO)90 million from (EURO)80 million as a direct result of 
"intense price competition" with Lufthansa subsidiaries in both Germany and Austria, whom it accuses of engaging 
in "below cost selling".
Lauda now expects to carry 6.5 million passengers in the year to 31 March 2020 but at average fares that are 
(EURO)15 below budget, resulting in Lauda's net loss widening for the year .
Ryanair will release its third quarter results on 3 February, when it will update shareholders in further detail on these 
trends.

Boeing 737 Max Should Return In 2020 But The Crisis Won't Be Over
Boeing 737 Max Should Return In 2020 But The Crisis Won't Be Over

The Boeing 737 Max will likely return to service sometime in 2020, but that won't close the books on one of the 
aerospace giant's worst crises in its 103-year history.
Boeing (BA) will have to address key questions, such as how quickly production can ramp back up and how much 
compensation airlines will get for the grounding.
Lawsuits from families of crash victims and investigations are also pending. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission is reportedly probing Boeing's financial disclosures related to the grounding. Congress, the Justice 
Department, FBI and the Transportation Department inspector general's office also have been looking to see if the 
company provided misleading information about the Boeing 737 Max to regulators and customers. And the FAA is 
investigating 737 Max production practices.
For now, top Boeing 737 Max customers expect the plane to fly again in early to late spring. Southwest Airlines 
(LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) removed the jet from their schedules until April, while United Airlines (UAL) has 
removed it until June.
But those are just the U.S. carriers with the Boeing 737 Max in their fleets. Depending on when regulators around 
the world OK the plane, the return to service elsewhere may take longer. Chairman and incoming CEO Dave 
Calhoun suggested in an interview with CNBC in November that the return of the Boeing 737 Max may take until 
2021 to complete "in its entirety."
Then there is the flying public. Airlines will have to deal with passengers who find out if their flight is on a Boeing 
737 Max and want to change to a different plane. Some airlines will let skittish passengers switch, but European 
budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) reportedly won't and won't offer refunds either.
Boeing 737 Max Production Outlook
To stop the flow of grounded jets spilling out into employee parking lots at the Seattle-area factory, Boeing will halt 
production of the narrow-body jet starting in January and told its suppliers to stop deliveries starting in mid-January.
Boeing previously slowed 737 Max production to 41 a month in April as the global grounding took hold, but planned 
to ramp up to 46 by the end of 2019, then to 52 by February 2020, and to 57 by the end of 2020.
Boeing 737 Max Should Return In 2020 But The Crisis Won't Be Over
The failure of the Boeing 737 Max to obtain clearance this month to fly again has thrown that timeline out the 
window. But a whistleblower warning also threatens the ability to ramp up, even when the plane is recertified.
Former Boeing employee Edward Pierson told Congress earlier in December that he witnessed a factory in chaos 
and reported serious concerns about production quality to senior Boeing leadership months before the Lion Air 
crash in 2018.
FAA chief Stephen Dickson revealed at a Capitol Hill hearing that the regulator has opened a probe into Boeing 737 
Max production processes after the whistleblower warning surfaced. He also suggested more enforcement action 
may be on the way.

Charges To Weigh On Boeing Earnings, Cash Flow
Boeing has booked $9.2 billion in charges relating to the 737 Max grounding, and the production halt won't stop the 
bleeding.
The company will still burn through $1 billion a month during the halt, though that's down from $2 billion a month 
before the halt, according to a JPMorgan analyst.
Moody's recently cut Boeing's debt rating one notch to A3, saying the production halt will mean additional financial 
support to many suppliers, elevated risk in the production system, and higher customer compensation, which will 
lower 737 margins and cash generation "for years to come."
The company hasn't detailed the financial impact to suspending output, but Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), which gets 
about 50% of its revenue from the Boeing 737 Max, has suspended production of fuselages.
Meanwhile, engine supplier General Electric will boost production of its Leap 1A for Airbus (EADSY) to help offset 
lost sales to Boeing during the 737 Max production halt, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Spillover From Boeing 737 Max Crisis
Before the crashes, the FAA often delegated key tasks to Boeing, and global regulators had often followed the 
FAA's lead. Not anymore. And that new relationship will have long-term effects on the 737 Max as well as other 
planes.
The FAA will have to approve every Boeing 737 Max before delivery to airlines, the regulator said in late November. 
Boeing previously had authorization to perform routine predelivery safety checks by itself. In addition, European, 
Brazilian and Chinese aviation regulators have their own requirements, separate from the FAA's, to be fulfilled 
before the jet can return to service.
Other Boeing planes will likely face extra scrutiny too. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has said it will 
conduct its own "concurrent validation" of the FAA's certification of the next-generation Boeing 777.
The UAE's aviation regulator will review the certification process of the 777X as well, sources told the Wall Street 
Journal. The UAE's move is key as it affects the Emirates airline, which is a major 777X customer.
And that's for an update to an existing aircraft. How will regulators treat a totally new plane? Boeing has said it's still 
considering a midmarket aircraft with a clean-sheet design.
Boeing CEO Turnover
Former CEO Dennis Muilenburg had reportedly antagonized the FAA with his predictions on when the Boeing 737 
Max would return to service. That prompted the FAA to push back as it sought to counter the image of the regulator 
having a cozy relationship with Boeing.
Boeing 737 Max Should Return In 2020 But The Crisis Won't Be Over
After being removed as chairman in October, Muilenburg was fired from his CEO role on Dec. 23. Calhoun will take 
over on Jan. 13, and a top priority will be to repair ties with the FAA.
Analysts were bullish on his appointment as CEO. Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned called him the right choice 
"given his managerial skills and knowledge," according to a recent note.
Calhoun has a long history of working in aviation and helping turn companies around during a crisis. He was 
appointed to run General Electric's (GE) jet engine business after 9/11. He's also served on Boeing's board since 
2009.
But Boeing's CEO turnover won't stop with Muilenburg's ouster. The company has a mandatory retirement age of 
65, meaning 62-year-old Calhoun can only serve a few years. That leaves enormous pressure on Calhoun and the 
company to quickly find a replacement and prepare him or her for the role.
"He is likely to have a relatively short tour of duty at Boeing," Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research 
Partners, said in a research note. Calhoun's focus will be "getting the 737 Max back into service without further 
aggravation, and starting the process of finding a new CEO and senior management team that can potentially get 
Boeing back on track."

A mother is eternally thankful to her daughter after the child reported an issue to flight attendants during a flight to 
Greece that eventually saved her life.
According to the New York Post, 39-year-old Alexandra Hajipaulis was on a Ryanair flight from England to Crete in 
July 2018 when her six-year-old daughter, Jaideen, noticed her mother had passed out in her seat shortly after 
takeoff.
When Jaideen notified the attendants working the flight, they called for a doctor who determined Hajipaulis was 
suffering an ischemic stroke. The captain called for an emergency landing in Italy, where the plane touched down 
safely, and Hajipaulis was transported to a local hospital in a coma.

The Irish High Court has rejected an attempt by Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) to stop Peter Bellew, its former chief 
operating officer, from joining arch rival easyJet (U2, London Luton) until 2021, saying that a 12-month non-
compete clause was not possible to enforce. Ryanair has said it will appeal. Over the two weeks until the December 
23 ruling, the Irish carrier stressed that Bellew possessed information of substantial value to direct competitors in 
the low-cost sector and that a contract clause prevented him from employment at easyJet at least until January 
2021.

Rename Boeing 's 737 MAX? Airlines Already Aren't Using 'MAX' Prominently
Rename Boeing's 737 MAX? Airlines Already Aren't Using 'MAX' Prominently

A 737 MAX was seen last week with the identification markings on its nose saying only "737-8" with no mention of 
"MAX," prompting brief speculation if Boeing, having fired CEO Dennis Muilenburg, would next catch up with public 
opinion by doing away with the MAX name associated with two crashes that killed 346 people, prompted the jet's 
worldwide grounding, and set off a corporate crisis for Boeing.
Even President Trump has weighed in on the MAX name: "If I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add 
some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name," he Tweeted in April. Boeing's then-CFO 
and now interim CEO Greg Smith said in June Boeing did not have plans to rename the MAX but was open-
minded.
Yet the recent speculation was unfounded. The aircraft in question was from Xiamen Airlines, which has not applied 
"MAX" markings since taking delivery of its inaugural MAX in May 2018, a half year before the first MAX crash.
Of the 54 airlines that have 737 MAXs identifiably painted, only 11 airlines consistently write "MAX" on the aircraft's 
nose, likely the most obvious physical indicator to passengers if their 737 is a MAX. A further 26 airlines put "MAX" 
only at the aircraft's rear while 13 airlines have no markings mentioning the aircraft type at all. Three airlines say 
737-8 without mentioning MAX, while Ryanair has inconsistent practices.
There is no standard for how to mark aircraft. US airlines sometimes indicate "MAX" on the nose landing gear door 
along with other identification information, but they do not have prominent "MAX" markings on the forward or rear 
fuselage. This includes Southwest, which with 310 MAX orders is the second-largest airline customer after Lion Air. 
The third-largest customer, flydubai from the United Arab Emirates, also does not have any markings. Air Canada 
writes "Boeing 737 MAX 8" on the rear while compatriot WestJet writes only "737-8". All took delivery of their first 
MAX before the initial crash.
In the case of Xiamen, while it says "737-8" on the nose, its majority owner China Southern Airlines uses no 
markings on the nose, instead writing near the tail "Boeing 737-8" without mentioning "MAX". The first MAX to 
Panama's Copa Airlines has a large "MAX 9" on the rear of the aircraft.

Like most operators, Shanghai Airlines does not feature the aircraft type on the forward part of the aircraft
Rename Boeing 's 737 MAX? Airlines Already Aren't Using 'MAX' Prominently
Boeing does not show signs of changing the MAX name. When it rolled out the -10 variant in late November, "MAX" 
was still adorned on the nose. Boeing extensively used the MAX name in a presentation this month to airlines about 
how to re-build confidence in the aircraft type, as first reported by the New York Times.
One presentation slide writes "the MAX" over a dozen times with only one citation of "737 MAX," which was in 
reference to a new Boeing website, 737MAXupdates.com.
For those looking if airlines will drop the "MAX" name, there is the curious case of Ryanair, whose MAX 8 200 
variants have been seen with "737 MAX," "737-8200," as well as no markings.
So with most airlines never having "MAX" in a clearly visible part of the aircraft to begin with, does the name 
matter? There are arguments the name could be visible elsewhere, like the safety card. Southwest Airlines 
inadvertently confused some passengers early in the MAX's grounding because Southwest's safety card for its 737-
800s also mentioned it was applicable to the MAX since the two variants share features.
The MAX name could also be visible in the booking process. While Southwest and United Airlines plan to make 
aircraft type clear to passengers during the booking process, will customers of Ryanair, Europe's largest MAX 
customer, know their aircraft type in advance? "The answer is that you won't," CEO Michael O'Leary told 
Flightglobal. "We do our aircraft allocations on a nightly basis. You're booking your ticket six, eight weeks in 
advance."
Besides being told during booking or by aircraft livery if the 737 is a MAX, there are physical differences, such as 
the MAX's engine cowlings having chevrons, unlike earlier 737s. But such differences could be harder for the 
general public to distinguish.
O'Leary expects passenger confidence in the MAX to quickly return once the aircraft is flying. He draws a 
comparison to the 2013 grounding of the 787 due to battery problems, although they were non-fatal. "While they 
replaced the batteries, there was concern about customer sentiment. Customers got over it about a week after the 
plane was back flying," he said.
Boeing changing the "MAX" name could backfire since a rebranding would draw more attention to the MAX's history 
and imply Boeing needs the public to forget the MAX's history. Instead, Boeing's return to service plan appears 
focused on instilling confidence by communicating what it has changed on the MAX since the two crashes.
"I feel a very large commitment to the flying public to ensure that we prevent accidents like this from ever happening 
again," Boeing chief pilot Craig Bomben said in a video testimonial. "We're going to figure out how to make not only 
our products but the industry safer going forward."

Dec 30, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Norfolk 
Southern Corporation NSC[1] have surged more than 30% in 2019 compared with the industry[2]'s 28.6% 
rally.Reasons Behind the Price RiseThe company's operations are benefiting significantly from the implementation 
of the precision scheduled railroading operating plan, TOP21. Network efficiency of the Merchandise unit improved 
greatly owing to reduced circuity, train miles and train start following the implementation of the first phase of the 
new operating model. The execution of the second phase is currently underway.Norfolk Southern's measures to 
streamline operations by cutting costs are also paying off. Evidently, the company's operating ratio (operating 
expenses as a percentage of revenues) improved in each of the three quarters of 2019. It anticipates this key metric 
to show an improvement in 2019, over 65.4% achieved in 2018. Additionally, the company aims for a full-year 
operating ratio of 60% by 2021.Further, a robust free cash flow generation ($1.5 billion generated in the first nine 
months of 2019) enabled the company to frequently reward its shareholders. 
In the first nine months of 2019, the company returned $2.3 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($705 
million) and buybacks ($1,595 million). Norfolk Southern hiked its dividend payout twice in 2019.What's in Store for 
2020?Going into 2020, the company will continue to witness impressive bottom-line growth owing to its cost-cutting 
measures. The easing trade tensions (phase one trade deal reached between the United States and China) add to 
the positivity.However, there are a few setbacks that might linger into 2020. The company's automotive sub-group 
(part of its merchandise division) is witnessing declining volumes due to decelerating vehicle production in the 
United States and the scenario is unlikely to change drastically any time soon. Persistent below-par performance of 
other key components of the merchandise segment, such as forest and consumer plus metals and construction, 
might drag into next year. Additionally, contracting coal and intermodal volumes might weigh on the company's 
growth prospects in 2020.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings has been revised 4.7% 
downward over the past 90 days.Zacks Rank ...y PicksNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some 
better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[3] sector are Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. HA[4], Ryanair Holdings 
plc RYAAY[5] and GATX Corporation GATX[6]. While Hawaiian Holdings and Ryanair Holdings sport a Zacks Rank

Dec 30, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Recently, we issued an 
updated research report on Union Pacific Corporation UNP[1]. The company is witnessing sluggish overall volumes 
(measured by total revenue carload) due to weakness in key divisions. Due to weak volumes, freight revenues, 
which account for a bulk of its top line, are declining. Notably, freight revenues were down 4% in the first nine 
months of 2019.The same is likely to affect Union Pacific's fourth-quarter results, scheduled to be released on Jan 
23, 2020. In fact, the company issued a drab forecast for overall volumes at the Credit Suisse 7thAnnual Industrial 
Conference in December, thanks to headwinds ranging from trade tensions to economic slowdown.The company's 
chief financial officer, Robert Knight, stated that overall volumes for the fourth quarter of 2019 are expected to 
decrease a little more than 10% on a year-over-year basis. 
At the same conference, Union Pacific stated that the top line for the December quarter is anticipated to decline by 
a similar percentage as volumes.Moreover, its high debt levels are concerning. Notably, the debt/EBITDA ratio 
(adjusted) increased to 2.6 as of Sep 30, 2019, from 2.3 at 2018-end. Additionally, the massive capex might be a 
spoilsport.Due to the above-mentioned headwinds, shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the S...00 index 
over the past six months. The stock has gained 5.8%, while the index appreciated 9.8% in the same time 
frame.Estimate Revisions ...cks RankDownward estimate revisions highlight the pessimism surrounding the stock. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 earnings has been revised 1.7% downward over the past 60 
days.Given this bleak backdrop, Union Pacific's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is well justified.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors 
interested in the Zacks Transportation[2] sector can consider Hawaiian Holdings HA[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4]

respectively, in a year's time.Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is 
projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They're

Dec 27, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Parcel Service, 
Inc. UPS[1] expects yet another record-setting National Returns Day on the back of significant rise in online 
shopping during the holiday season.The company anticipates to receive a record 1.9 million returns packages into 
its network on Jan 2, the National Returns Day. The figure representing a 26% increase from that recorded a year 
ago will create a record for the seventh consecutive year.Given the rapid growth in online shopping, e-commerce 
sales have reportedly touched a record high[2] this holiday season. 
Per Mastercard's data, e-commerce sales jumped 18.8% year over year in the period between Nov 1 and Dec 24, 
2019.UPS is benefiting immensely from this solid uptick in e-commerce, especially on the domestic front. Evidently, 
the company's U.S. Domestic Package revenues grew 9.8% in the third quarter owing to 9% volume expansion 
across all products. Moreover, UPS anticipates cross-border e-commerce volumes to augment 28% during the 
2019-2021 period.Courtesy of rising package volumes and the company's measures to reward shareholders 
through dividends and buybacks, UPS' shares have rallied more than 23% in a year's time compared with the 
industry[3]'s 12.9% rise.Zacks Rank ...y PicksUPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in

Dec 26, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Air Lease 
Corporation AL[1] attained a 52-week high of $48.44 during the course of the trading session on Dec 24 before 
retracing a bit to close at $48.36. In fact, this Los Angeles, CA-based aircraft leasing company performed 
impressively in 2019. The stock has soared 60% compared with itsindustry[2]'s 32.4% growth.Let's delve deeper to 
unearth the reasons behind this appreciative share price rally and find out whether there is room for further rally:The 
company benefited from the robust increase in revenues, attributable to rentals of flight equipment in 2019. Notably, 
rental of flight equipment revenues accounts for bulk (96.2% of total revenues in the first nine months of 2019) of 
the top line at Air Lease. In fact, revenues from the segment rose 18.3% in the first nine months of 2019, leading to 
a 19.4% improvement in the company's top line.The company's efforts to expand its fleet are also encouraging. To 
this end, it is constantly adding planes to its fleet and removing the outdated models. Air Lease, which sold five jets 
during third-quarter 2019, had 307 owned aircraft in its fleet, representing a net book value of $18.9 billion, up 20% 
from the 2018-end figure. 
Total fleet size at the end of the third quarter was 737, lower than 758 (including owned fleet of 275) at the end of 
2018.We are also impressed by the company's endeavors to add shareholder value. Its latest investor-friendly 
move came in November 2019 when its board approved a 15.4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 15 cents per 
share (annualized 60 cents). The current raise marks the 7th payout increase in the company's dividend payment 
history.Air Lease rewarded its shareholders with dividends for 28 consecutive quarters. As investors prefer an 
income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is much coveted. Needless to say that investors are always 
on the lookout for companies, which boast an impressive history of regular and incremental dividend 
payments.Moreover, the airline industry is expected to perform better in 2020 compared with 2019, per a forecast[3] 
by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This bodes well for Air Lease as its fortunes are tied to the 
said industry.Zacks Rank ...y PicksAir Lease currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the 
Zacks Transportation [4]sector include Hawaiian Holdings HA[5], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] and Seaspan 
Corporation SSW[7], each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks

Court rejects Ryanair 's bid to delay operations chief's easyJet move
Court rejects Ryanair's bid to delay operations chief's easyJet move

The Irish High Court on Monday rejected Ryanair's attempt to prevent operations chief Peter Bellew from joining 
rival easyJet until 2021, saying a 12-month non-compete clause was unenforceable.
The Irish airline said it had instructed its lawyers to appeal.
Ryanair had argued during two weeks of hearings that Bellew possessed information of immense competitive value 
and was bound by a non-compete clause that the airline said should prevent him from starting work at the British 
low-cost rival until January 2021.
Lawyers for former Malaysia Airlines chief executive Bellew, denied he was subject to the clause, saying it was 
attached to a share option scheme they said was effectively valueless.
They also argued that the restriction against working for "any airline that competes with Ryanair in any market," was 
overly broad.
Judge Senan Allen said that while the non-compete clause was valid it was also unjustifiably restrictive by 
preventing Bellew from joining any airline, not just those in the same part of the market as Ryanair.
"I find that the covenant in this case, properly construed, would prevent the defendant from taking up employment 
with any European airline, including the legacy carriers, and so goes beyond what the plaintiff has shown to be 
justified," Allen said in his judgment.
Court rejects Ryanair 's bid to delay operations chief's easyJet move
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had told the court that he would not have an objection to Bellew joining a 
higher-cost "legacy carrier," but that information Bellew possessed could be damaging to Ryanair in the hands of a 
low-cost competitor.
The judge said what was relevant was the wording of the non-compete clause - which was deemed in the ruling to 
be too broad - not how Ryanair intended to enforce it.
During the court case, Bellew told the judge that he believed the clause could apply to airlines all over the world 
who sell short-haul tickets that compete with Ryanair as part of multi-leg long-haul journeys.
Bellew left his role as CEO of Malaysia Airlines two years ago to return to Ryanair, where he had been director of 
flight operations before leaving in 2014. (Reuters)

Ryanair has failed to prevent easyJet from hiring its former chief operating officer after a Dublin judge refused to 
block the appointment.
In a ruling in the Irish high court yesterday, Mr Justice Senan Allen said Ryanair's action against Peter Bellew "must 
be dismissed".
Mr Bellew, a 30-year aviation veteran who resigned from his role at the Irish low-cost carrier in July, is due to join its 
UK rival on January 1. His appointment was seen as a coup for easyJet.
Ryanair said it had "instructed its lawyers to immediately appeal this decision". Mr Bellew, who was in court for the 
ruling, left without comment.
During eight days of hearings, the court was told of bitter clashes between Mr Bellew and Ryanair's longtime chief 
executive Michael O'Leary.
Mr Bellew left Ryanair in 2015 after a nine-year stint and later became chief executive of Malaysia Airlines. But Mr 
O'Leary asked him to return in late 2017 as the Irish airline confronted a rostering crisis that led to thousands of 
flight cancellations. The debacle ultimately led Ryanair to recognise trade unions for the first time in its 30-year 
history.
Ryanair loses court bid to stop former executive joining easyJet; Airlines
But relations between Mr Bellew and Mr O'Leary soured. In November 2018, the chief executive complained that Mr 
Bellow's performance in a number of respects was unacceptable.
Mr Bellew said in court that Mr O'Leary had told him "you are f**king useless" at meetings with executives. But in 
his ruling the judge said the assertion had not been put to Mr O'Leary and added Mr Bellew had shouted into the 
court microphone and "appeared to me to be playing to the gallery".
Mr Bellew quit last summer to join easyJet, prompting a swift court challenge from Ryanair to prevent him going to a 
rival airline.
The judge said yesterday the case was "hard fought on both sides". He noted Mr O'Leary was inclined to use 
language that "would not be heard at a vicarage tea party" but said he was the boss and entitled to set the pace he 
expected from executives paid about (EURO)1m per year.
His 73-page ruling came after Ryanair argued that Mr Bellew agreed not to work for any airline for one year after 
leaving the company when he accepted share options in June 2018.
However, the judge said the non-compete covenant was "as a matter of law, void and unenforceable as an 
unjustified restraint of trade".
The case was closely followed in legal and human resources circles as it centred on the enforceability and limits of 
non-compete covenants used to ensure senior executives do not leave for rivals with confidential information that 
can be used to damage their business.
The thrust of the judge's ruling was that the Ryanair covenant placed too broad a restriction on Mr Bellew.
Although Ryanair had a legitimate interest in exacting such a covenant from Mr Bellew, the judge said its interest 
did not extend beyond airlines in the low-cost or low-fare sector.
"I find that the covenant in this case ... would prevent the defendant [Mr Bellew] from taking up employment with 
any European airline, including the legacy carriers, and so goes beyond what the plaintiff [Ryanair] has shown to be 
justified," the ruling said.

 The High Court of Ireland denied Ryanair Holdings' (RYA.L) bid to delay its chief operations officer's move to 
competitor EasyJet (EZJ.L) to 2021, Reuters reported Monday.
In his ruling, Judge Senan Allen said a 12-month non-compete clause was valid, but it was also unjustifiably 
restrictive as it stops Peter Bellew from joining any European airline, according to the report.
Ryanair had claimed Bellew had information of competitive value and that he was subject to a non-compete clause. 
Bellew's lawyers denied he was bound by the clause, saying it was attached to a share option scheme that was 
"effectively valueless," the report said.

More people than ever before travel by plane. This has caused massive growth in the airline industry and Wall 
Street has taken note. For those who are interested in learning more about the best airline stocks, it s important to 
learn about the major carriers. Top Airline Companies in the World

From Linhas Aereas to Spirit airlines, many carriers from around the globe are respectable players in the industry. 
However, the world's top international airlines have each developed a unique strategy that has propelled them to 
become leaders within the industry. Before investing in airline stocks, it helps to understand some of the key 
aspects of this high-flying industry. Airline Industry
According to the International Air Transport Association, the number of air travelers has massively increased in 
recent years. In 2012, there were about 3 billion air travelers, but in 2019 there is expected to be about 4.5 billion. 
The global airline industry has a total revenue of over $800 billion. Though this is a large and quickly growing 
industry, airlines often struggle to differentiate themselves. 
There is little to no difference between the fleets of planes each airline flies. All airlines use either Boeing or Airbus 
jets. Airlines need a variety of different types of planes to make different types of journeys. Having more or bigger 
planes isn t necessarily beneficial unless they re used on the right routes at the right times. 
A plane with better fuel economy can save money since fuel costs are minimized, while a plane with well-known 
issues, such as Boeing s 737 Max, can cost companies a lot of money. The biggest expense for airlines is gas, 
which also makes it harder for airlines to differentiate themselves since fuel costs affect all airlines similarly. 
Consumers want to get where they re going as quickly and cheaply as possible and there is not much that airlines 
can do to change either of these two things. For example, an airline can include a free checked bag in the price of

the ticket, but commercial airplanes travel at the same speeds. In general, most major airline companies have 
positioned themselves into two major groups: full-service and budget. Full-service airlines aim to meet the needs of 
many different types of travelers, both business and leisure, by offering many different flight options to destinations 
all over the world. Budget airlines focus almost exclusively on price and try to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. 
Top Airline Companies in the World
These top companies showcase the many different strategies that airlines can use to stand out in the competitive 
airline market. United Airlines (UAL)
United Airlines falls within the category of a full-service airline. Though Delta has a larger market capitalization, 
United Airlines is the largest airline based on many other metrics, including revenue, fleet size, and total number of 
passengers. Though United Airlines does not have the largest market cap of all airline companies, it still has a 
strong market capitalization of $21.2 billion. 
United Airlines had a strong 2019. The first half of the year saw growth, based largely on lower fuel prices and an 
increase in the number of people traveling. The company s growth was not limited to the first half of 2019. Travel 
demand continues to increase, and this trend is reflected in the company s third-quarter earnings. United Airlines  
third-quarter net income reached over a billion dollars, which is a 23% increase from the same quarter of the 
previous year. This increase in revenue occurred even though United Airlines was forced to ground all of its Boeing 
737 Max planes after issues caused two aircraft to crash. The grounding of the Boeing 737 Max planes has had 
some negative effect on the airline, including a lower than expected capacity. 
United Airlines also saw third-quarter growth in its revenue per available seat mile. Revenue per available seat mile 
is an important industry metric that calculates how much the airline earns for every seat it flies per mile. This metric 
is especially useful since not all flights are equal in terms of revenue. For example, a flight from New York City to 
France and a flight from Los Angeles to Australia may use the same size plane with the same number of 
passengers, but the different flights will have different effects on revenue. 
United Airlines has projected a strong 2020 for the company, though investors should tread cautiously. While United 
Airlines has potential to grow, its most recent growth was based in large part on lower fuel costs. This means that 
the company will likely be unable to maintain the same level of growth that it saw in 2019. Delta (DAL)
In terms of market capitalization, Delta is the largest airline in the world, with a market cap of $37.1 billion. Delta is 
considered a full-service airline, though it still remains fairly cost-effective. Delta is an innovator in the airline 
industry and the company has been at the forefront of the airline industry over the last decade. Delta was one of the 
first of the full-service airlines that revamped its prices in order to remain competitive with the many different budget 
airlines. 
Delta stands out from other airlines by offering customers access to flights all over the world with many different 
flight options. This allows customers to get where they want, when they want. Delta manages to do this by 
partnering with many smaller, international airlines. Delta also has a history of thinking outside of the box and 
coming up with effective solutions to various problems. For example, in 2012, Delta was having issues getting a 
sufficient amount of jet fuel to its hubs in the northeast United States. To solve this problem, Delta bought a refinery 
in Pennsylvania in order to have more access to fuel. 
Delta s returns have outperformed many of its competitors. For those with a dividend investing strategy , it is also 
worth noting that Delta pays a relatively high dividend compared to many others in the industry. Though there are 
many reasons that investors may want to purchase Delta stock, one potential concern is how Delta stock will 
perform during a recession. In general, the airline industry is significantly affected by recessions since many people 
cut back on travel. However, since much of Delta s revenue comes from first-class and business class tickets, Delta 
could be harder hit by a recession than others in the industry. Southwest Airlines (LUV)
Unlike United Airlines and Delta, Southwest Airlines is a discount airline. Southwest caters to a more cost-
conscious consumer base by offering low-cost flights. Though Delta is the largest airline in terms of market cap, and 
Airline Stocks - Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now
United Airlines is the largest in terms of other metrics such as revenue, the largest airline in terms of profit is 
Southwest. Southwest also boasts a strong market capitalization of $27.8 billion. 
In December 2019, Southwest announced that it would have to cancel a number of flights in 2020. These 
cancellations are due to continued issues with the Boeing 737 Max plane. Southwest said that it would have to 
cancel about 300 national flights, but the company did not specify which flights would be canceled. According to the 
company, all of the canceled flights are between March 6th and April 13th of 2020. 
Southwest is the largest customer of Boeing s 737 Max planes, which means the grounding of the max jets has had 
an especially detrimental effect on the company. Southwest says that the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane 
has already cost the company $435 million, and the recent cancellations extending into April will likely continue to 
add to this number. 
Though the grounding of Boeing s 737 Max plane has had a negative impact on many airlines, including Southwest, 
2019 was still a strong year for the company. Southwest reported record net income and operating revenue in its 
third-quarter earnings report for 2019. These numbers are especially impressive given the effect of the grounding of 
the Boeing 737 Max. The most recent news shows that the grounding is still affecting Southwest and investors 
should keep this in mind when considering whether or not to purchase Southwest stock. Singapore Airlines 
(SINGY)
Singapore Airlines is based in Singapore and offers flights all over the world. The airline provides both long haul 
and short-haul flights. Though the company s $8 billion market capitalization is smaller than some of its competitors, 
the company s diverse strategy is worth noting. Singapore Airlines has branded itself as a service-based airline, 
compared to the growing number of discount competitors. Though the Singapore Airlines name is marketed as a 
high-quality airline, the company also takes advantage of other markets within the airline industry. 
Singapore Airlines' most noteworthy operations include SilkAir, Budget Aviation, and SIAEC. SilkAir focuses on a 
regional market. Budget Aviation has a focus on low-cost air travel through the company s Scoot brand. SIAEC 
focuses on maintenance and fleet management. These diverse segments of Singapore Airlines have allowed the 
airline to avoid having to limit itself to either the full-service category or the discount category of the airline industry. 
Singapore Airlines' strategy appears to be working well. In the company s most recent quarter, Singapore Airlines 
saw a 68% increase in profit compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The company has said that this 
increase was based largely on the success of its joint ventures and relationships with associate companies. This 
dramatic increase in profit has caused many investors to take note of the airline, but investors should tread 
cautiously. Though dramatic gains can mean good things for the future of a company, many companies see these 
returns and expect the company to keep up an unsustainable level of growth. Investors will have to wait and see if 
Singapore Airlines can keep up its strong growth into 2020. American Airlines (AAL)
American Airlines is a full-service airline with a market cap of $11.4 billion. Technically, American Airlines Group 
Inc. is a holding company that owns multiple airlines that fly both passengers and cargo. The company s cargo 
service transports various cargo, including mail, all over the world. Though American Airlines offers global flights, 
the company has the strongest presence around its hubs, which include cities some mid-sized cities, such as 
Charlotte, Dallas/Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and the District of Columbia. 
American Airlines, like many others in the industry, saw a fairly strong 2019, despite some setbacks. Like almost all 
other airlines, American Airlines faced challenges due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. On top of these 
issues, the company had operational issues that caused the customer service team to have to do damage control. 
Given all these issues, American Airlines still had a strong quarter. The company s third-quarter earnings report 
showed a net income increase of 15% over the third quarter of 2018. Third-quarter revenue reached $11.9 billion, 
which is a record amount for American Airlines. Total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM), increased by 2% 
compared to the same quarter of last year. This TRASM is especially noteworthy since this is the 12th consecutive 
quarter that American Airlines  TRASM has increased. 
Airline Stocks - Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now
Though the majority of 2019 looked good for American Airlines, recently, the company has seen a dip in its stock 
price. Between mid-November and mid-December of 2019, American Airlines saw a 3.45% drop in the share price. 
In contrast, the S&P 500 gained 2.4% during that same period of time. Though this drop may be troubling, it also 
may be temporary. One area that does set American Airlines stock apart, especially for investors interested in 
dividends , is the decent dividend the company pays shareholders. Ryanair
Ryanair has taken the discount airline concept to the next level. The Irish company is based in Dublin and offers 
deeply discounted flights within the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Morocco, and Israel. Ryanair s strategy is 
similar to that of Southwest. Ryanair does not try to compete with full-service airlines and instead offers deeply 
discounted prices that often fly to secondary airports of mid-sized cities. 
This fairly straightforward approach has served the company well for many years, but recently Ryanair has begun 
diversifying. In the last two years, Ryanair created an Austrian based airline called Lauda, then it announced its new 
Polish subsidiary, Buzz, and in June of 2019 Ryanair unveiled Malta Air, an airline based in Malta. This is a large 
amount of diversity in a relatively small amount of time, especially considering how straightforward the company's 
strategy has previously been. 
The results of this diversification are still uncertain. The company had a rather tumultuous 2019, with the grounding 
of the Boeing 727 Max and an employee strike that occurred in August and September of 2019. Though there was 
a large amount of media attention given to the pilots that went on strike, enough pilots remained that few flights 
were actually affected. In the most recent quarter, Ryanair has seen an increase in the number of passengers as 
well as an increase in revenue. But these results have been tempered by an increase in cost. Even with the 
increase in revenue and passengers, the growth in costs caused Ryanair s operating profit to decrease, though 
overall profit remained the same as the previous year. Ryanair s strategy update is worth keeping an eye on, but 
even if the strategy is successful, it may still be a few quarters, or even years, before the results are fully realized. 
JetBlue (JBLU)
JetBlue falls into the discount category of airlines. Though JetBlue is smaller than many of the other major airlines, 
with a market cap of $5 billion, the company is still a major player in the airline industry and is one that investors 
should keep an eye on. Unlike some of the other top airlines, which offer international flights all over the world, 
JetBlue instead focuses on a smaller region. JetBlue offers flights all over the United States, as well as in the 
Caribbean and Latin America. Since JetBlue only flies within North America, it can better focus its efforts in a single 
geographic area. This highlights how different airlines have managed to succeed by using completely different 
strategies. For example, JetBlue s strategy is very different than Singapore Airlines, but both companies have found 
success in their individual niches. Though JetBlue s flights are mostly domestic, the company still has over 30 
million customers a year and over 80 different destinations. 
JetBlue s third-quarter report was a mixed bag. Revenue passenger miles increased to $4.26 billion. This is a 3.7% 
increase for JetBlue from the same quarter of the previous year. RPMs are an important metric that the airline 
industry uses to measure the amount of traffic. In other important metrics, though, JetBlue failed to have more 
positive results. One specific area where JetBlue saw less than great third-quarter results was the company s load 
factor. For the third quarter of 2019, JetBlue s load factor decreased. This metric measures the percentage of seats 
filled by passengers. The decrease in load factor was caused by an increase in capacity that was not matched by 
traffic growth. This means that JetBlue had more capacity but was unable to get as many customers as expected, 
and therefore could not reach the capacity level it had hoped to obtain. Airline ETF
The airline industry is complex, and it can be difficult for an investor to know which companies are the best airline 
stocks. Those struggling to decide which stocks to buy may be able to invest in an airline ETF instead of an 
individual airline stock. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a fund that is publicly traded on a stock exchange, but 
that is made up of multiple securities. Unlike hedge funds, the goal of an ETF is not to beat a certain industry or 
sector, but instead to match the growth of the overall sector or industry. As a result, the securities in an ETF usually 
fall within one sector or industry. 
While hedge funds are often better suited for more risk-tolerant individuals, an ETF allows an investor to invest in 
multiple companies with only one investment. This can help an investor create a more diversified portfolio and also 
Airline Stocks - Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now
minimizes the stress of having to pick one or two companies in an industry they re not familiar with. For those 
looking to make an investment in an Airline ETF, it s worth considering the following: 
•
SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN)
•
iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT)
•
U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)
Should I Invest in Airline Stocks?
Airline stocks have historically been viewed as a bad investment, and it was the rare stock advisor who would 
suggest investing in the airline industry, but a growing number of passengers combined with more streamlined 
strategies have created more potential for the airline industry. Airline stocks may not be the biggest stock gainers , 
best growth stocks , or most active stocks , on Wall Street but they may still have a place in your portfolio. 
Though the last ten years may have made airline stocks look like a good investment, it s also important to keep in 
mind that airline stocks may not perform as well during recessions, which have historically been difficult for airlines. 
For the time being, airline stocks have the potential to be a good investment as part of a diversified portfolio.

 The High Court of Ireland will rule Monday on Ryanair Holdings' (RYA.L) bid to delay its chief operations officer's 
move to competitor EasyJet (EZJ.L) to 2021, Reuters reported Friday, citing a court official.
The court was scheduled to make a decision if Ryanair can prevent Peter Bellew from joining EasyJet on Friday, 
according to the report.
Ryanair claimed that Bellew has information of competitive value and that he is subject to a non-compete clause, 
the report said. Bellew denied that he is bound by the clause in his contract, saying he hopes to join EasyJet as 
COO at the beginning of 2020 after completing a six-month notice period.

 Ireland's high court has delayed its ruling on whether Ryanair (RYAAY) chief operations officer Peter Bellew can 
transfer to rival budget airliner Easyjet, a court official told Reuters on Friday.
The court will now issue its decision on Dec. 23.
Ryanair is trying to stop Bellew's bid to join the British firm, arguing that the executive has information of competitive 
value and that he should postpone his transfer until 2021. Bellew is also bound by a non-compete clause, which the 
former Malaysian Airlines boss denies, according to the report.

Dec 20, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In a bid to meet the 
surge in air-travel demand during the holiday season, Spirit Airlines has SAVE[1] introduced daily non-stop flights 
connecting Puerto Rico, San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marn International airport Boston Logan International airport and 
Newark Liberty International airport.Moreover, the carrier will launch a second non-stop connecting Newark and the 
Puerto Rican capital from Feb 1, 2020. As part of the expansion plan, Sprit Airlines also intends to start operating 
flights connecting San Juan and three other U.S. destinations next year.Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price            
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/SAVE/price?icid=chart-SAVE-fundamental/price Spirit Airlines, Inc. 
price[2] | Spirit Airlines, Inc. Quote[3]Specifically, flights connecting the Orlando and San Juan will take to the skies 
from Feb 21, 2020. Similarly, flights on the San Juan- Philadelphia and San Juan- Baltimore start from Mar 1 and 
May 21, respectively. Notably, Spirit Airlines already operates multiple flights to Puerto Rico.Spirit Airlines' decision 
to expand its presence in San Juan seems prudent, as the city is one of the most attractive tourist spots. The carrier 
is being aided by robust passenger revenues on the back of strong demand for air travel. Passenger revenues, 
accounting for bulk of the top line, increased 26.7% in 2018. Continuing with this trend, the same increased 16.3% 
year over year in the first nine months of 2019. The additional flight package to and from San Juan is likely to bump 
up the carrier's passenger revenues further.Zacks Rank ...y PicksSpirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), at 
present. Some better-ranked airline stocks are Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[4], Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) and 
Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft DLAKY[5], sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe

BRITISH Airways will feel the pressure as it freefalls to a spot alongside the nation's worst flyers, above only 
Ryanair and American Airlines, according to a survey by Which.
It is a fast fall from grace for the company that topped the tables in 2015 as strikes, IT failures and mass 
cancellations have clipped the firm's wings. BA was also scolded for its food and drink, seat comfort and value for 
money. It was seen as the third worst short-haul and second worst long-haul option in a survey of more than 6,500 
people.
One Which member surveyed said: "BA is, without doubt, the worst airline we've ever used."
BA also came under fire this year from journalist Andrew Neil, who accused the firm of trying to "destroy what little 
goodwill it has left".
Just behind BA, Ryanair retained its title of worst short-haul airline with a customer score of 44 per cent, while 
American Airways was the worst longhaul airline with 48 per cent.
Ryanair took flack for its endless addons and tricky luggage requirements. It was accused of treating customers 
"like cash cows" and having a "cattle class mentality".
Vueling Airlines and Wizz Air hovered around two stars out of five for most aspects of the customer experience. 
Wizz, however, did pick up three stars for value for money.
With flying colours, Jet2 bagged a 79 per cent customer score. One traveller even said: "Jet2 doesn't feel like a 
lowcost airline."
BA ranked among worst airlines for British flyers
Easyjet cruised to a mediocre score of 65 per cent and touched down in the middle of the short-haul table. 
Customers called it "fine", "reliable", and "no frills".
By contrast, Singapore Airlines landed a score of four stars out of five across the board and landed an 88 per cent 
customer score.

British Airways  UK's national airline drops to second-last place in Which? long-haul rankings In Depth[1] Gabriel 
Power[2] Thursday, December 19, 2019 - 3:07pm British Airways has slumped to second last place in a poll of 
customer satisfaction with major airlines, with only Ryanair faring worse. See related British Airways hack: why 
record 183m fine could have been far greater[3] British Airways pilots begin two-day strike[4] British Airways IT 
failure: what happened and can you claim compensation?[5] The UK's flag carrier airline has been criticised for the 
cost-cutting measures new management introduced in 2016. And those cutbacks appear to be taking their toll, 
judging by the annual poll in consumer magazine Which?
. In it, BA ranks poorly in almost every category, The Telegraph[6] reports. 'Once self-proclaimed 'the world's 
favourite airline', BA has this year found itself grounded,' the consumer magazine said of BA's fall from grace. But 
what went so wrong for BA?What did the rankings say?The annual Which? Travel airline survey[7]ranks airlines 
based on the experiences of the 6,500 survey participants with regard to the service'sfood, seat comfort and value 
for money on both short and long-haul services. BA performed poorly in all categories,being kept off the foot of the 
table in the long-haul rankings only by American Airlines, with customer satisfaction score of 55% (first placed 
Singapore Airlines had 88%). Meanwhile BA finished third from bottom in the short-haul rankings, ahead of Ryanair 
(bottom) and Vueling (second from bottom), with another 55% score for customer satisfaction. Air Aurigny, a small 
airline serving the Channel Islands, took the top spot.What went wrong?BA was awarded the best short-haul airline 
title in the 2015 Which? Travel survey, but a number of issues have contributed to its decline in recent years. 
Which? puts the blame onIT failures and power outages[8] that resulted in mass cancellations, as well as data 
breaches[9] and the recently resolved pilots' dispute[10] - problems it sayshave 'continued to see the airline 
descend in customers' estimations'. -------------------------------For a round-up of the most important stories [11]from

e..._content=in-article-link-politics------------------------------- But others believe the problem stems from a significant 
business strategy shift introduced by current CEO Alex Cruz, who joined in 2016. A low-cost airline guru, Cruz has 
presided over an overhaul of BA's operations so the airline can compete with budget airlines in Europe. This has 
included scrapping free food and drink on short-haul flights, with two in five of BA's passengers claiming the food 
Why British Airways has nosedived with passengers
that was available wasn't worth the money. Furthermore, Cruz also introduced a new pricing system including 
categories such as Basic, Plus and Plus Flex, which gave options to fly without checked luggage, and with 
additional costs for seat selection and flight changes. But survey respondents added that BA's flights were still poor 
value for money. As the Telegraphnotes: 'It would be unfair to lay the blame at Alex Cruz's door, but the beginning 
of his tenure is unfortunate when considering the above.'What has BA said?The airline has publicly disputed the 
Which? findings and says they are not based on reliable data. 'Our own data shows customer satisfaction scores 
have increased, and continue to increase, as we deliver our 6.5bn investment for customers on new aircraft, new 
food, new lounges and new technology,' a spokesperson said. 'We offer our customers a choice of cabins on all our

BA falls below budget airlines in passenger satisfaction rankings

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ba-falls-below-budget-airlines-in-passenger-satisfaction-rankings/British 
Airways, once promoted as the 'world's favourite airline', has been named alongside Ryanair as one of the worst in 
the country after slumping close to the foot of an annual passenger league table.The company was beaten by 
budget carriers such as Jet2, Easyjet, Flybe and Wizz Air in a ranking based on travellers' experiences in the past 
12 months. Some passengers vowed not to travel with BA[1] again after a year marked by IT failures and strikes, 
leading to mass flight cancellations. 
The league table, compiled by the consumer group Which? and published today, placed BA in 15th place out of 17 
airlines for the quality of short-haul flights, and 14th out of 15 for long-haul flights.Which? said that it represented a 
rapid fall from grace for the airline, which had been named the best short-haul carrier in the group's 2015 survey. 
The conclusions cap a difficult 12 months for BA. In August thousands of passengers had their plans thrown into 
chaos when the carrier suffered an IT failure, cancelling almost 130 flights and delaying at least 300 more. A month 
later BA was forced to ground 2,325 flights, almost its entire schedule, when pilots staged a two-day walkout 
affecting almost 200,000 passengers. BA has hit back, questioning the accuracy of the study, which was based on 
a survey of 6,535 Which? members. It pointed out that the results for some higher-ranked airlines were heavily 
skewed because only a handful of survey respondents had flown with them this year. It said its own data indicated 
that customer satisfaction scores had increased on the back of BA's 6.5 billion investment in new aircraft, airport 
lounges, food and technology. The Which? study named Ryanair[2] as the worst short-haul carrier overall for the 
sixth year in a row, with only 44 per cent of passengers satisfied with its performance. Passengers criticised the 
'endless add-ons' during the booking process and the 'finicky' luggage requirements with one passenger saying 
they were treated like 'cash cows'. Customers gave the airline the lowest score of one star out of five in most 
categories including boarding, customer service and cabin experience. Vueling, the Spanish budget airline, which is 
owned by the same parent company as BA, was second from bottom with 54 per cent and BA was third on 55 per 
cent. Aurigny Air Services, the Guernsey airline, was top on 82 per cent, followed by the budget carrier Jet2 on 79 
per cent. Among long-haul carriers, American Airlines was named as the worst, scoring 48 per cent, followed by BA 
with 55 per cent. Singapore Airlines was top on 88 per cent. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel magazine, said: 
'Year after year the same culprits continue to sink to new lows yet for many of us there is a choice. You don't have 
to keep booking with an airline that has let you down — or one that you loved for years but has slipped in quality. If 
BA falls below budget airlines in passenger satisfaction rankings
you get a choice and you are flying short-haul, choose Jet2. It is better quality than BA and often has better fares 
than Ryanair. If you are heading to the states, Virgin Atlantic beats BA hands down.' BA said: 'Our own data shows 
customer satisfaction scores have increased, and continue to increase, as we deliver our 6.5 billion investment for 
customers on new aircraft, new food, new lounges and new technology. 'We offer our customers a choice of cabins 
on all our flights, lounges for business-class customers, free food for all long-haul flights and business class for 
short-haul, and we are delighted to be able to offer our customers the most extensive network by any UK airline, 
including newly added destinations to Pittsburgh, Charleston, Osaka and Antalya.' Read more: BA falls below

Persimmon's bosses cashed in as fire safety went unchecked UK COMPANIES

What did Persimmon boss Jeff Fairburn do to earn £85m in two years? Critics suggested he did nothing more than 
become chief executive of the housebuilder just as a government subsidy scheme artificially inflated its share price 
- and his share-based bonuses. Customers claimed he skimped on quality and left fully paidfor homes unfinished 
just to keep margins high. But, now, an independent reviewer has found, he also presided over a company that, 
despite making £1bn of annual profit, did not properly check whether fire safety measures had been installed.
Stephanie Barwise concluded that Persimmon under Mr Fairburn had become "more a ... seller of houses rather 
than a housebuilder" where "a culture of non-observance" and "boxticking" had been encouraged. And one 
"manifestation of poor culture" that she found was "incidence of missing or incorrectly installed cavity barriers" - 
needed to prevent fire spreading via the walls of timber-frame properties.
Persimmon, now under new CEO Dave Jenkinson and new chairman Roger Devlin, may deserve credit for opting 
to publish such damning findings and reinspecting 16,000 homes. However, that is little over half the number the 
company needs to check - and only half the battle in achieving what it accepts is "required cultural change".
Cultural failings, the review argues, stemmed from that focus on selling new properties, rather than necessarily 
building them well. Some supporters dispute this and note that Persimmon spent less on marketing than its peers.
Still, Ms Barwise is adamant that the board must now "reconsider Persimmon's purpose and ambition".
Persimmon's bosses cashed in as fire safety went unchecked UK COMPANIES
Under the ambitious Mr Fairburn, regional managing directors' purpose was to maximise profit - and earn their own 
promotions and bonuses - by doing things their own way. But that meant there were no group-wide building policies 
or procedures. It also meant inspections were focused on fixing post-build snags, not getting build quality right first 
time.
One industry figure likened Persimmon's customer service to that of notoriously brusque airline Ryanair, quipping it 
was as though "they'd tell dissatisfied homebuyers that the DIY store was first on the right".
So can the battle to change this culture - which Mr Devlin seems keen to fight - be won? In Mr Jenkinson - a 
Persimmon employee of 22 years, and one of those former regional managing directors - he does not have an 
obvious agent of change ... although the internal candidate did come cheaper than those who sought £10m "golden 
hellos". Nor does he yet have an exacting, expert board: Ms Barwise urges the appointment of a nonexecutive with 
construction experience "to facilitate constructive challenge".
Ironically, then, his - and customers' - best hope of change is Mr Fairburn's £85m bonus scheme. It made 40 other 
Persimmon managers so wealthy that they retired. Have the old culture and fire safety complacency gone too?

Borden/Business Insider IPOs and stock market gains made several entrepreneurs billionaires[1] in 2019, but they 
cost other business people their spots in the three-comma club. Several people, including the founders of 
WeWork[2] and SmileDirectClub[3], lost their billionaire status when their IPOs didn't go as planned. Juul[4] 
cofounders Adam Bowen and James Monsees were only billionaires for 10 months. With partial guidance from 
Forbes' March list of people who dropped of its billionaires[5] rankings, Business Insider rounded up 15 individuals 
who lost their billionaire status in the past year. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[6] The only thing more difficult than becoming a billionaire is 
staying one — just ask the 247 people who lost their rankings[7] on the Forbes billionaire list between 2018 and 
2019. Several of those people, including the founders of WeWork[8] and SmileDirectClub[9], lost their billionaire 
status in 2019 when their IPOs didn't go as planned. Others, such as the founders of Forever21[10] and 
RyanAir[11], saw their net worths decline over multiple years amid falling sales. Keep reading to see who dropped 
out of the three-comma club in 2019, listed in order of their exits. Business Insider compiled the list by referencing 
Forbes[12]' list of people who dropped off its billionaire ranking and by referring to Business Insider's ongoing 
billionaires reporting from various sources. For the purposes of this article, we focused on some of the biggest 
names in business, or the people behind some of the best-known companies. The net worths below are accurate as 
of December 2019, or reflect the most recent data available where noted. RyanAir's falling stock price knocked 
CEO Michael O'Leary off Forbes' Billionaires List in March. Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesNet worth: less than $1 
billion[13], as of January 2019 O'Leary, 58, served as the CEO of the budget airline since 1994, according to 
Forbes[14]. O'Leary once compared RyanAir's business model to that of Wal-Mart, according toForbes[15], saying 
the airline aims to "pile it high and sell it cheap." Theairline struggled[16] with falling profits, Brexit concerns, the 
Boeing 737 Max grounding, and pilot strikes throughout 2018, sinking the company's shares. Forbes estimated that 
O'Leary was worth $1.1 billion in 2018[17], but RyanAir's declining stock price brought O'Leary's net worth below $1 
billion,The Independent's Samantha McCaughren [18]reported in January. His current net worth is unknown.Four 
heirs to the Barilla pasta fortune also dropped off Forbes' Billionaires List in March. Jean-Marc Giboux/AP Images 
for BarillaNet worth:$1.1 billion each in 2018[19] Siblings Emanuella, Guido, Luca, and Paolo Barilla share an 85% 
stake in the largest pasta company in the world, Forbes[20] reported in 2016. At the time, Forbes[21] estimated that 
the siblings were worth about $1.5 billion each. Guido Barilla serves as the Barilla's chairman, while Luca Barilla 
Bye bye, billionaires: 15 people who lost their billionaire status in 2019
and Paolo Barilla are both vice-chairmen. The pasta company faced a crisis in 2013 when Guido Barilla said in a 
live interview that Barilla would never feature a same-sex couple in its advertisements and that gay customers 
should look for another brand, Bloomberg's Thomas Buckley[22] reported in May. Though Guido Barilla's comments 
only had a marginal effect on Barilla Pasta's bottom line, according to Bloomberg[23], the company has since dealt 
with falling sales in the US as consumers' tastes move away from processed food.Money manager Charles 
Brandes fell off Forbes' Billionaires list in March. WILL RAGOZZINO/Patrick McMullan via Getty ImagesNet 
worth:$1.2 billion in 2018[24] Brandes, 76, built his fortune running Brandes Investment Partners, the San Diego-
based investment management firm he founded in 1974, according to Forbes[25]. At its peak, Brandes had over 
$100 billion under management, but now has only $31 billion, Forbes[26] reported. Brandes left the firm in February 
2018. Brandes derives a large share of his net worth from his stake in the firm, closely tying his net worth to its 
performance.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[27] See Also: Billionaires of the 2010s: From Facebook

Dec 17, 2019( Proactive Investors: http://www.proactiveinvestors.com Delivered by Newstex)  Shares in the LSE's 
major listed airlines descended on Tuesday in the wake of the news that Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) will be suspending 
production of its 737 MAX aircraft following two fatal crashes. In an announcement overnight the aeroplane maker 
said it will suspend production in January after US aviation regulators made it clear that the MAX will not be cleared 
to return to the skies before the end of the year as the company had originally hoped. 
READ: TUI trims dividend policy as profits dip on Boeing MAX grounding 'We believe this decision [to suspend 
production] is least disruptive to maintaining long-term production system and supply chain health', the company 
said in a statement, adding that going forward it will instead prioritise the delivery of the 400 MAX planes currently in 
storage. The company also stressed that there would be no layoffs as a result of the stoppage. Analysts at 
Jefferies, which rate Boeing at 'buy' with a price target of US$420, said that while the lack of a schedule for when 
the MAX could return to service created a 'timing abyss', the stoppage would conserve around half of the US$4.4bn 
in cash burn per quarter than they had previously forecast. The broker also expected a relatively quick return to 
service next year, forecasting that deliveries of the MAX will resume in April, although the delay meant they 
expected Boeing to deliver 462 planes for its 2020 financial year as opposed to previous estimates of 807, a 
reduction of 43%. Carriers and suppliers suffer losses Aside from Boeing's own woes, the prospect of a delay to 
deliveries of new planes next year sent shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) down 3.3% to €14 in early 
afternoon trading on Monday, while travel giant TUI AG (LON:TUI) fell 1.3% to 978p. Ryanair has 135 MAX aircraft 
on order that have yet to be delivered, while TUI is awaiting 72 planes after having already received 15. TUI blamed 
the grounding of the aircraft for a 28.4% decline in profits for its last full year, as well as for the decision to trim its 
dividend policy going forward. Meanwhile, London-listed companies manufacturing components for the MAX were 
also on the way down. Senior PLC (LON:SNR), whose aerospace unit counts Boeing as its largest customer, was 
down 9.2% at 169.1p, while Meggitt PLC (LON:MGGT), which supplies Boeing with multiple products including fire 
protection and flight displays, was 1.6% lower at 659.4p. QinetiQ Group PLC (LON:QQ.), which tests Boeing's 
designs as its wind tunnel in Hampshire, also dropped 1.1% to 350p. Boeing's shares were down 1.3% at 
US$322.50 in pre-market trading in New York on Tuesday.

as well), the carrier is witnessing some cost pressure due to escalating non-fuel unit costs. Evidently, non-fuel unit 
costs (excluding special items) grew 2.9% in the first nine months of 2019. The same is projected to rise 0.5% year 
over year in the fourth quarter (against the previous expectation of 1.2% decline). For 2019, non-fuel unit costs are

Dec 17, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Copa Holdings, S.A. 
CPA[1] reported disappointing traffic statistics for November. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs), slipped 1.5% to 1.7 billion in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (measured 
in available seat miles/ASMs) dipped 2.9% year over year to 1.99 billion.This fall in capacity and the resultant 
decrease in traffic can be attributed to reduced capacity due to the extended grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jets. 
The carrier with six Boeing MAX 9 jets in its fleet removed all MAX flights from its schedule through March 2020[2]. 
Consequently, multiple fight cancellations are affecting its revenues.Meanwhile, with traffic declining less than the 
amount of capacity contraction, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 120 basis points (bps).In the 
first 11 months of 2019, the carrier generated RPMs of 19.49 billion, down 0.9% year over year, and ASMs of 22.99 
billion, down 2.4%. Load factor expanded 130 bps to 84.8% in the period.Copa Holdings, S.A. Price

Dec 16, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  American Airlines Group 
AAL[1] has extended the grounding period of its Boeing 737 MAX jets through Apr 7, 2020, as talks pertaining to 
the approval for the MAX aircraft's return to service continue between Boeing and the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). Pointing at several technicalities that need to be addressed, the FAA hinted at the completion 
of the process in 2020.Following the extension of the MAX grounding period, American Airlines is expected to 
cancel approximately 140 flights per day through Apr 6, 2020. The carrier, which has 24 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its 
fleet, previously suspended the MAX flights through Mar 4, 2020. In October, the airline stated that its 2019 pre-tax 
income is likely to be hurt by approximately $540 million due to the flight cancellations from the groundings. 
Reduced capacity as a result of the groundings is weighing on the company's costs.On Dec 22, American Airlines 
plans to provide a flight schedule update for passengers booked on MAX flights through April 6.American Airlines

Outgoing Ryanair COO felt like 'dead man walking' court hears
Outgoing Ryanair COO felt like 'dead man walking' court hears

Ryanair's outgoing chief operations officer Peter Bellew considered himself a "dead man walking" after a March 
performance review and resigned after being ordered to work at the airline's Austrian business, he said on 
Thursday.
Bellew was speaking in court during a case brought by Ryanair to delay him joining rival easyJet for 12 months until 
2021. Ryanair has said Bellew possesses information of competitive value covered by a non-compete clause.
Former Malaysia Airlines boss Bellew denies he is subject to the clause and plans to start working with the British 
airline at the start of next year after working out a six-month notice period.
The court hearings, which have gone on for longer than the four days initially expected, have included assessments 
of Bellew's performance and an accusation, rejected by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, that Bellew was bullied.
Bellew, who was being questioned by his own counsel and Ryanair's, said "shouting and screaming" by O'Leary 
during weekly management meetings indicated that O'Leary was not entirely happy with his performance.
But Bellew said he was "absolutely shocked and devastated" when O'Leary at a March 2019 annual performance 
review said that his position as Chief Operations Officer would be reviewed after 12 months unless his performance 
significantly improved.
Bellew told the court that he understood that to mean he was a "dead man walking."
Outgoing Ryanair COO felt like 'dead man walking' court hears
"I know Michael O'Leary very well and I know when he writes something like that, that's what he means," Bellew 
told the court. O'Leary last week denied he was trying to force Bellew out, saying if he wanted him out he would 
have removed him.
Bellew told the court he did not make a final decision to leave the company for several months, assuming that what 
he described as dramatic improvements in operations due to changes he had undertaken in ground operations, 
pilot numbers and engineering would be noticed.
He finally decided to leave in July after he had been made an offer by easyJet.
The final straw was when O'Leary took Bellew into his office and told him he wanted him to spend six months 
addressing issues at Austrian subsidiary Lauadamotion in Vienna, where he has spent much of the past six months.
Bellew said he was devastated that he felt he had to leave as he had planned to stay at Ryanair until retirement.
Bellew told the court that he felt the 2018 share option scheme, which contains the non-compete clause Ryanair is 
trying to enforce, was obsolete as deterioration in company performance and share price meant it was unlikely to 
vest.
Most other senior executives were offered a replacement scheme in 2019, but Ryanair says the 2018 scheme is still 
operable.
Bellew said information he had regarding how Ryanair operates would be of limited use to easyJet as Ryanair 
operates in a "unique way" and discloses its costs publicly in its annual accounts. (Reuters)

Further details are emerging from the Irish High Court case between ex-Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) Chief Operating 
Officer (COO) Peter Bellew and his former employer, with the country's aviation regulator, the Irish Aviation 
Authority, suggesting that it nearly grounded 162 of the ultra-low-cost carrier's (ULCC) aircraft in 2018. Ryanair is 
taking legal action to prevent the COO, who is leaving the airline, from joining easyJet (U2, London Luton) in 
January 2020 under a non-compete clause which Ryanair claims is still valid.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will maintain its Girona base, after coming to an agreement with employees at the Spanish 
airport which sees a modification to their contracts from permanent fixed to discontinuous fixed ones. The new 
contracts come into force on January 1, 2020. The decision was explained to Europa Press by Unió Sindical Obrera 
de Catalunya (USOC) spokeswoman Lidia Arasanz. "There was a meeting at the end of November and the workers 
were told that if the base was to be maintained, most employees had to sign this contract renewal." Arsanz also 
indicated that the new contracts contain "super abusive clauses" as they do not maintain worker's seniority and do 
not recognise the category of cabin crew, they are merely defined as customer service agents.

Dec 10, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish airline 
Ryanair has agreed to keep its base in the northeastern Spanish city of Girona open in exchange for reducing its 
employees' salaries and working hours, union officials said Tuesday.In August, the budget carrier said it would 
close four of its Spanish bases due to "significant overcapacity in the European short-haul market" in a decision 
affecting bases in Tenerife, Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Girona.Although the three Canary Islands bases are still 
to close as scheduled on January 8, the airline has decided to keep Girona open.But USOC union official Lidia 
Arasanz accused the airline of "putting pressure" on staff to accept a bad deal. "They had a meeting in which they 
said that to keep the base open, the employees would have to sign... a new contract with the company in which 
they would only be contracted to work nine months of the year instead of 12," she said. 
Ryanair had announced last month that it would close some bases because of problems with Boeing's crisis-hit 737 
MAX jet Photo: AFP / PAU BARRENA Contacted by AFP, Ryanair was not immediately available for comment.The 
union representative said a new contract would mean employees' annual salaries could be reduced by around 25 
percent.When the period of negotiations ended on December 5, Ryanair posted a message on its internal website, 
indicating that "enough employees had signed the new contract and that Girona would stay open under the new 
conditions from January 1", she said.She did not say how many of the base's 164 staff had signed the new 
contract.At the end of July, the Irish carrier said it was planning to axe 900 jobs from its 13,000-strong workforce, 
sparking several protests by employees in Europe.

Ryanair may not receive any 737 Max aircraft from Boeing by next summer over European delays in testing the 
grounded jets, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said, estimating the issue is costing it at least 100 million euros a 
year.
Ryanair trimmed its passenger traffic forecast last week but that was still based on 10 MAX deliveries by June. 
O'Leary told Reuters on Tuesday that testing in Europe was running behind the United States and planes were 
likely to remain grounded until April or May.
"We're still looking to meet with Boeing in mid-early January. We expect the Max to be back flying in early January, 
particularly in North America. We think it could be a bit slower in Europe because the EASA (European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency) seems to be dragging their heels a little bit," O'Leary said in an interview. (Reuters)

Dec 10, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Airlines Holdings UAL[1] grabbed headlines following the news that Scott Kirby will take over as chief executive 
officer (CEO) of the company, replacing incumbent Oscar Munoz next year. Notably, Kirby has been serving United 
Airlines as its president since 2016. He had joined this Chicago-based company from another airline heavyweight 
— American Airlines Group AAL[2].Furthermore, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] slashed its 
summer 2020 traffic growth forecast on account of delivery delays pertaining to Boeing 737 MAX jets. On the traffic 
front, Latin American carriers — Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[4] and Azul AZUL[5] — reported a decline in 
their respective load factors (% of seats filled by passengers) for November as traffic growth was outpaced by 
capacity expansion.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here[6])Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. 
Following United Airlines' Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 20, 2020, Scott Kirby will take charge 
as the carrier's CEO. From May 20, 2020, the current CEO Oscar Munoz will serve as the executive chairman of 
the company's board of directors for a year. 
Also, United Airlines' chairman, Jane Garvey, will retire in May next year. Additionally, Ted Philip, who currently 
chairs the Nominating/Governance Committee, will take charge as the lead independent director on May 20. (Read 
more: Scott Kirby to Take Over as United Airlines' CEO in 2020[7])2. As the Boeing 737 MAX jets have been 
grounded since March 2019, Ryanair has received only 10 such planes instead of the initial plan of 20. 
Consequently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Irish airline company now expects passenger growth of 156 million for 
fiscal 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021) compared with 157 million anticipated previously. Further, the carrier plans to 
close two bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta due to the unavailability of this aircraft. Ryanair is currently 
in talks with its staff, unions and 'affected airports' to decide on summer capacity cuts at a few other bases as well.

today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].3. At GOL Linhas, traffic, measured in revenue passenger 
kilometers (RPK), climbed 3.8% to 3.4 billion in November. While international RPK declined 13.2%, domestic RPK 
grew 6.3% in the month. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat 
kilometers/ASKs) was up 6.4% to 4.21 billion, primarily on 8.9% expansion in domestic capacity. Moreover, the 
carrier witnessed an 8.3% increase in passenger count during November. (Read more: Gol Linhas' November 
Traffic Rises, Load Factor Declines[10])4. At Azul, consolidated traffic increased 30.6% year over year owing to

strong demand for air travel. Traffic increased 30.4% and 31.4% in domestic and international markets, 
respectively. Consolidated capacity expanded 32.5% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in domestic capacity 
was 30.9%. On the international front, capacity rose 38.3%. (Read more: Azul's Traffic Rises But Load Factor 
Declines in November[11]).5. At Hawaiian Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings (HA), 
November traffic increased 4.1% year over year. Meanwhile, capacity expanded 3.6%. Additionally, load factor 
improved 50 basis points (bps) to 84.6% as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion. The carrier transported 
more than 912,000 passengers in November. However, the November passenger count declined 2.7% year over 
year. During the first 11 months of 2019, load factor improved 120 basis points to 86.6%. Passenger count declined 
1% year over year in the January-November period.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of 
the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that the majority 
of the airline stocks traded in the green during the past week. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased 
1.7% to $109.15 in the period. Over the course of six months, the Index appreciated 11%.What's Next in the Airline

After Brexit, the Air Passenger Duty Reform Group claims that that abolishing or halving APD will unlock significant 
economic benefits and give the UK a competitive advantage. "As an island trading nation, and with international 
trade deals post-Brexit, I think that helping reduce APD so that people can travel more both for business and 
pleasure is something that will be good for the economy," says Conservative MP Henry Smith, who chairs the 
group, and has Gatwick Airport in his Crawley constituency. Smith claims that the £3.7bn the levy brings in is lower 
than the revenue that could be generated if APD was abolished. The campaign to scrap APD has been welcomed 
by many airlines, including low-cost carrier Ryanair. "Air Passenger Duty should be fully abolished and the UK 
should follow the Irish example to allow tourism and jobs to grow and ensure airports can compete and attract more 
business. 
APD makes countries less attractive to airlines and visitors, particularly for regional airports," says a Ryanair 
spokesperson. "Removing the travel tax will help grow British tourism and business at a time when it needs support 
given the ongoing uncertainty created by Brexit. The removal of APD would also support the regions, which are 
impacted the most by this tax." Is APD a price worth paying?Not everyone in the travel industry wants APD to be 
cut. Tim Williamson is customer director of Responsible Travel, a sustainable travel agent based in Brighton. He 
proposes that APD shouldn't just be kept, but should actually go up for environmental reasons. "It needs to increase 
and that's purely as a result of the climate science on aviation," he says. "I hope fares go up because of a general 
recognition that the market is oversupplied. And that taxation is coming in to slow down the increase in aviation so 
that we stand a chance of hitting the 1.5oC planet average temperature rise by 2030." Williamson dismisses Henry 
Smith's suggestions that abolishing APD would bring in more money than the levy currently raises. "It's just 
nonsense, it makes absolutely no sense. The aviation sector is growing at a massive rate anyway," he says. "APD 
is not a barrier to the growth of the UK PLC." Independent aviation commentator Sally Gethin says there were 
positives and negatives in keeping APD, highlighting both the environmental benefits, while also potentially leaving 
Air Passenger Duty post Brexit: in or out?
the UK at a competitive disadvantage post-Brexit. Nevertheless, she suggests that scrapping APD may not be the 
magic fix that some suggest. "Keeping Air Passenger Duty might not actually make a difference to the travel trends 
because passenger traffic is still climbing and passengers do want to travel. So it may not be the silver bullet," she 
explains. Air Passenger Duty explainedUK Air Passenger Duty is charged on all flights for passengers aged over 16 
and is the highest in Europe. It is roughly three times more expensive than the rate charged in France and twice as 
much as Germany currently taxes. In the UK, there are two bands. Band A is for shorter flights where the distance 
between London and the destination's capital city is up to 2,000 miles. Band B covers long-haul flights when the 
distance between London and the nation of arrival's capital city is greater than 2,000 miles. Prices for Band A start 
at £13 for the reduced rate, which typically means economy seating. The standard rate begins at £26, covering 
business and first-class. The higher rate is £78. Higher rates are for planes weighing more than 20t or carrying 
fewer than 19 people. Band B's reduced rate is £78, the standard levy is £172, and its higher rate is £515. Band B 
levies are due to increase in 2020, with £80 for reduced, £176 for standard, and £528 added onto the higher rate. 
The tax originally came into force on 1 November 1994, having been introduced in the previous year's budget by 
then chancellor Ken Clarke in John Major's Conservative Government. As with most taxes, APD has been 
increased many times in subsequent budgets. Henry Smith voted in favour of budgets in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 
which all included rises in APD. "APD was part of an overall budget package," he explains. "Therefore, I was faced 
with a choice of voting against the whole budget that I agreed with, say, 95% of it, or voting against the budget 
because of one issue." "But certainly, I think that Brexit has thrown into much sharper relief the importance of us 
being an island trading nation for reducing APD." APD is considered one of the simplest taxes for governments to 
increase. "My understanding of APD from having worked for two airlines is that it's one of the lowest costs and most 
efficient taxes that the government has, which also comes back to why it's never going to be cut," explains Tim 
Williamson.  "It's one of the easiest and progressive taxes the government has and they're never, ever going to 
reduce it." Yet if it were abolished, would new routes materialise? And where exactly would they operate? New 
potential flight routes in the UKAs far as connectivity goes, the UK is grossly imbalanced with a disproportionate 
amount of decent transport links serving London and the south-east. Elsewhere in the country, options can be more 
limited. Scrapping APD is seen as a way to increase travel options for those living in the regions by opening up 
possibilities for more flights, particularly as many London airports are either at full capacity or are very close to 
reaching it. Trade body Airlines UK claims that APD has made certain routes too costly to run. In a report from 
September 2018, the organisation claims that scrapping ABD could lead to new domestic routes such as Liverpool 
to Southampton, Bristol to Leeds, and Edinburgh to Guernsey. Short-haul non-domestic flights could see services 
from Belfast to Madrid, Aberdeen to Munich, and Newcastle to Lisbon. While potential long-haul routes could run 
from Birmingham to Tel Aviv, Edinburgh to Delhi, and Bristol to Dubai. "Airlines UK holds the longstanding view that 
the UK's high levels of Air Passenger Duty - the highest in the developed world for long-haul and the highest in 
Europe for short-haul - is doing damage to the UK economy and our connectivity, by making routes too expensive 
for carriers to put on and maintain," says an Airlines UK spokesperson. "In a post-Brexit world and as we look to 
reach out to new markets, all the while strengthening our existing links to Europe and beyond, this appears all the 
more self-defeating. "We want the tax to be cut by at least 50% across the board. Our research shows that if APD 
were abolished as many as 65 new routes from the UK would become viable, both long and short-haul, and from 
airports mainly outside the south-east of the UK." Despite Brexit looming on the horizon, there is a general 
consensus that there won't be a dramatic increase in flight costs once the UK leaves the EU due to competitive 
pressures, at least in the short term. Environmental responsibilityThe aviation industry is estimated to contribute 
2.5% of all global manmade greenhouse gas emissions, which is lower than many people think. But given the 
backdrop of environmental protests and the general public becoming more eco-conscious, is abolishing APD an 
environmentally responsible thing to do? Henry Smith MP thinks so and suggests that technology will play an ever-
greater role in aviation's future. "I do think the answer is through technology," he says. "Last year, Virgin Atlantic 
had its first trans-Atlantic bio-fuels flight landing at Gatwick Airport. EasyJet, most of their planes now are the A320 
Neos, which I think are a quarter to a third more efficient in terms of fuel burn." "So I do think that we can have 
economic growth and environmental sustainability at the same time. I don't think the two are mutually exclusive." 
Meanwhile, Tim Williamson proposes that increased APD should, in fact, be ring-fenced and invested in developing 
new technologies for sustainable aviation. He also urges the government to offer more incentives for people to use 
greener methods of travel such as rail. For example, Germany is proposing to increase APD to offset its cuts in VAT 
from 19% to 7% on train journeys longer than 50km as part of a series of environmental measures. "You've got to 
get people off planes, especially for short journeys. We understand that while there aren't viable, sustainable 
Air Passenger Duty post Brexit: in or out?
alternatives to kerosene that means long-haul flights are going to be difficult. Certainly, EasyJet and others think 
that short-haul electrification, short-haul hybrid, short-haul synthetic fuel aircraft are not a million miles away," he 
says. "It has to happen quickly, because of 2030, because of the 1.5oC, we would take all the mechanisms of APD 
because they already exist. They're already understood by the industry, by government and to a certain extent by 
the customers. You could implement a Green Flying Duty based on APD very quickly."

A ranking of the top 10 corporate polluters in Europe has included a shipping group for the first time, in a sign of 
how some emissions-heavy industries are escaping the environmental clampdown imposed on others.
Vessels run by Mediterranean Shipping Company, the continent's largest, emitted 11m tonnes of carbon dioxide 
last year on journeys to, from or within the EU, according to analysis of EU data by Transport &Environment, an 
NGO.
That made MSC Europe's eighthworst polluting company, breaking into a list that was until recently the exclusive 
preserve of coal-fired power stations. It is only the second company not in that sector to break into the top 10, 
following Irish airline Ryanair's inclusion this year.
Shipping is among the only industries not covered by the Paris Agreement on climate change and although UN 
industry body the International Maritime Organisation has set the goal of halving its emissions by 2050, few 
immediate steps have been taken to reach the goal.
"Almost everything we touch has been on a ship," said Faig Abbasov, shipping manager at Transport & 
Environment. "All those things have a huge environmental footprint - an invisible element in the supply chain that 
has a huge impact on the environment."
Switzerland-headquartered MSC's 362 Europe-operating ships are responsible for 25 per cent of the continent's 
container ship carbon emissions, ahead of second-placed Maersk, which has 335 ships and a carbon output of

8.22m tonnes. The broader European shipping industry, including passenger and bulk cargo vessels, produced 
139m tonnes of C02 in 2018, and emissions in the sector are 19 per cent higher than in 1990, according to 
Transport &Environment.
Global trade growth has fuelled the expansion of container shipping, according to the International Transport Forum 
think-tank, which estimates the sector has tripled in size since 2000.
While other modes of transport are subject to emissions regulations, shipping has so far escaped serious limits. 
MSC said it was investing in improvements to the sustainability of its fleet that had resulted in a 13 per cent 
reduction in C02 emissions per unit of transport work.
While it emits more carbon in total than other shipping companies, it was among the most energy efficient, emitting 
19.92g of C02 for each tonne of cargo per nautical mile. "MSC operates a modern, green fleet and is investing 
heavily in low-carbon technologies and extensive new-build and retrofit programmes," the company said.

Ryanair has announced that it will close several bases in 2020 including Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta as the 
airline revises its summer 2020 schedule and growth projections. The closures follow the disclosure that the airline 
will now receive only ten Boeing 737 MAX aircraft next year.
The Irish LCC has two aircraft stationed in Nuremberg and four in Stockholm Skavsta, these bases will be closed in 
March next year.
Some other bases will also be affected but the LCC has not revealed which ones in particular. "We also expect to 
cut summer capacity in a number of other existing bases, and we are currently in discussions with our people, our 
unions, and our affected airports to finalise these minor reductions," the airline stated in a press release.
The decision issue to the ongoing Boeing 737 MAX delivery problems. "We regret these two further bases closures 
and minor capacity cuts at other bases which are solely due to further delivery delays to our Boeing MAX aircraft," 
said Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's DAC CEO according to the statement. "We are continuing to work with Boeing and 
affected airports to minimise these capacity cuts and job losses."

financial viability while acknowledging that people will gradually have to work longer.

among developed countries, but there are 42 "special regimes" for railway workers, lawyers, opera employees and 
others offering earlier retirements and other benefits.The government says a single system will be fairer for 
everyone while ensuring its financial viability while acknowledging that people will gradually have to work longer.

TRAVELLERS trying to get the Eurostar to the continent were thwarted yesterday, after 78 trains linking London to 
Paris, Belgium and the Netherlands were cancelled amid ongoing strikes in France.
The most affected routes are for trains from St Pancras to Paris, with the cancellations scheduled to take place 
between 5-8 December.
An estimated 50,000 international rail passengers have had to make other arrangements.
It comes as a French national strike also forced airlines such as Easyjet, British Airways and Ryanair to cancel 
flights to European cities.
Travel workers were joined by teachers and emergency room medics in launching one of the biggest public sector 
strikes in France for decades yesterday, determined to force President Emmanuel Macron to abandon plans to 
overhaul France's generous pension system.
Transport networks in Paris ground to a near halt as unions dug in for a protest that threatens to paralyze France 
for days, and poses the most severe challenge to Macron's reform agenda since the so-called gilets jaunes, or 
"yellow vest" protests erupted. Rail workers voted to extend their strike today, while unions at Paris' transport 
operator said it would continue until Monday.

Dec 05, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Ryanair 
passenger was barred from boarding flight with her wheelchair and was asked to find another flight by the staff. 
The passenger suffers from Friedreich's ataxia, a rare genetic disease that causes difficulty walking.Speaking to 
local media[1] Wednesday, the passenger, identified as Belen Hueso, said she was flying from Seville to Valencia, 
Spain, when she was denied boarding pass as her electric wheelchair wouldn't fit in the hold."They told me 'go and 
look for another company,' she said, adding that she had never heard of the rules."Maybe nobody complained or 
the rules were set up this year,' she said. The exact date of the incident was not known.The passenger also said 
that though the airline initially refused to refund her $77, they eventually repaid.Confirming the same, an airline 
spokesperson said, 'This has been resolved with the customer directly, and a full refund has been processed. Per 
our terms and conditions, the dimensions of wheelchairs when collapsed must not exceed 81cms (height), 119cms 
(width) and 119cms (depth). Unfortunately, in this case the customer's wheelchair exceeded these dimensions. We 
regret any inconvenience caused." In this representational photo, a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft lands at

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has taken the decision to close two of its bases, at Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta 
airports, which, it said in a statement, is as a result of delays in the delivery of its B737-8-200s. In addition, the ultra-
low-cost carrier's (ULCC) plans to reduce capacity on some of its routes over the Summer 2020 season. Ryanair 
has again revised next summer's schedule based on receiving just ten B737 MAX 8s rather than the 20 as 
previously planned. As a result, expected traffic growth for FY2021 (year ending March 31, 2021) is cut from 157 
million passengers to 156 million.

LOW-COST airline Ryanair trimmed its passenger traffic forecast yesterday, saying it would cut summer capacity 
and an unspecified number of jobs as a result of further delays in returning Boeing's grounded 737 Max aircraft to 
service.
Ryanair has scrapped planned summer operations from bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta, as well as 
some flights from other bases, "solely due to delivery delays" to Max jets on order from Boeing, the firm said.
It also cut its traffic forecast to 156m passengers for the year to 31 March 2021 from 157m.
"We are continuing to work with Boeing, our people, our unions and our affected airports to minimise these capacity 
cuts and job losses," Ryanair added.
The 737 Max, Boeing's fastest selling aircraft, was grounded in March after two crashes in which a total of 346 
people died.
US airlines have so far canceled planned Max flights until March and a return to service is likely to take longer in 
Europe.
Ryanair, one of the biggest Max customers with 210 planes on order, is working with "a steadily declining number" 
of deliveries expected by summer, group chief executive Michael O'Leary said during a court hearing in Dublin.
Shares rose 1.8 per cent to (EURO)13.85 despite the news.

EVERY business has to deliver bad news from time to time - whether it is a delay, a data breach, or a price hike. Of 
course, these can be tricky situations to navigate.
It's easy to sound good when you're telling people about the wonderful products and services that you offer. It's 
much harder when you're telling them that they're going to be four hours late getting home.
This is something that we get asked about a lot at my brand writing agency. Is it best to cushion the blow? Should 
we keep things formal when we're saying sorry? Here's what I think.
MISTAKES WERE MADE It's tempting to fall back on safe, non-committal language, or bury bad news at the end of 
a long email. But this can be a big mistake.
An obvious example is the "nonapology apology". When the Equifax breach compromised the personal details of 
143m Americans (almost half the US population), this was the company's official statement: "Earlier this year, 
Equifax experienced a security incident involving a payroll-related service. The incident was reported to customers, 
affected individuals and regulators."
It's cold, passive, and doesn't really take responsibility for what went wrong. Unsurprisingly, it just made people 
angrier.
Sorry seems to be the hardest word for businesses OFFICE POLITICS ; Companies have no excuses when it 
comes to communicating bad news to customers
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BOAST It can also be tempting to soften an apology by reminding customers of all the 
great things that you do. But that's tricky to pull off.
For instance, Ryanair delivered the news that it was shrinking its fleet - and therefore cancelling flights - with an odd 
boast: "Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today confirmed it will slow down its growth this winter, by flying 25 less 
aircraft."
Reminding customers of the benefits that you offer can be wise if, say, you're increasing prices. But drop the hard 
sell, fast.
WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER The best corporate apologies share two qualities: they sound human, and 
are consistent with the brand's standard communications. You probably heard about KFC running out of chicken 
last year. Its response - a full-page ad in The Sun - was note-perfect: "A chicken restaurant without any chicken. It's 
not ideal. Huge apologies to our customers, especially those who travelled out of their way to find we were closed."
It's humble, honest, empathetic, and feels consistent with the brand's usual voice. It feels genuine, which turned a 
crisis into a triumph.
THE POWER OF PLANNING So how do you deliver an apology this good? One essential tactic is to plan ahead. If 
a crisis hits, you want to be ready for it - not formulating strategies in a panic.
Tone of voice guidelines generally focus only on "good news". But we encourage our clients to explore a range of 
scenarios - the good, the bad, and the just plain boring - so that they're ready for anything.
Armed with the right strategy, saying sorry doesn't have to be a disaster. In fact, as KFC showed, it could be one of 
the best things that you ever do.

 Ryanair Holdings' (RYAAY) CEO warned further delays in deliveries of Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX jetliner could result 
in additional cuts to its summer schedule. 
While testifying in a case concerning the departure of former Ryanair CFO Peter Bellew to EasyJet, Michael 
O'Leary said Ryanair might not receive any of the 58 737 MAX planes it ordered, an outcome that could wipe one 
million passengers from its full-year tally. Additionally, the Irish airline would have to cut jobs and close two bases 
as a result of reductions in passenger traffic due to the 737 MAX delays.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's largest customers of the 737 MAX.
On Thursday, Boeing said that "significant [FAA] regulatory requirements" could cause the company to cease or 
temporarily halt 737 MAX production.

Ryanair has cut the number of passengers it expects to carry next year and said it would close two bases as a 
result of the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jets after two fatal crashes.
The low-cost airline yesterday said it had reduced its forecast for passenger traffic next year by 1m, to 156m, based 
on it receiving 10 Max aircraft for summer 2020 rather than the 20 it previously planned.
This is the second time in five months that Ryanair has had to reduce its outlook. In July, the Irish airline cut its 
passenger growth forecast for the year to March 2021 from 7 to 3 per cent but warned it might have to cut it again.
Ryanair said the shortfall in Max aircraft would result in the closure of its Nuremberg, Germany and Stockholm 
Skavsta hubs next summer. It expected to cut summer capacity at a number of other existing bases but said these 
would be "minor reductions".
The airline has been forced to rein in its growth plans following delays to the delivery of the Max aircraft and 
uncertainty over how many jets it would receive and when they would arrive next year.
Boeing has said it could resume deliveries to airlines this month but this would be dependent on regulatory 
approval. Tanya Powley

Dec 05, 2019( Litigation Futures: http://litigationfutures.com Delivered by Newstex)  Supreme Court: Permission 
grantedThe Supreme Court is to review a controversial ruling that a law firm handling uncontested flight delay 
claims was not conducting litigation and so did not have an equitable lien over the compensation.The Court of 
Appeal's ruling in Bott ... Solicitors v Ryanair[1] was criticised for not giving solicitors credit for being more business-
like and efficient.The case concerned the airline dealing directly with the law firm's clients, including paying them 
compensation.The court said the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, and so did 
not have an equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees due to 
Bott.The Supreme Court has granted permission to appeal. It will consider what the limits are to the principle (as 
espoused in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21) under which a solicitor 
can ask the court to grant an equitable lien in order to protect his entitlement to fees as against his client.Speaking 
after the appeal court decision, Bott ... senior partner David Bott told Litigation Futures that he was disappointed by 
the decision, as he and counsel felt the firm's situation fell squarely within the parameters of the Edmonson 
ruling.He had also hoped the court would recognise 'the way the law was going' in terms of firms becoming more 
efficient using technology to process matters and said it had taken a lot of investment for claims to be handled in a 
'mechanical and formulaic' way.'If I'd had 100 10-year-qualified solicitors with pens and paper instead, it would not 
have been a problem,' he observed.Mr Bott added that, with 54% of its flight delay claims now being litigated, 'this 
may well be low value [work], but it is not necessarily low complexity or low in argument'.He stressed that the firm's 
business model was not under threat. 
'It will be a nudge on the tiller,' he said, and the firm would amend its processes to make clearer to clients what is 
expected of them when they receive their compensation.Well-known commentator Kerry Underwood, senior partner 
of Underwoods Solicitors, said the senior judiciary[2] needed 'to think through rather more carefully the whole issue 
of access to justice and litigation, and how it may be delivered'.Mr Underwood said: 'At one level, lawyers are being 
encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and do everything to avoid litigation, and yet Bott ... appears to be 
being punished for using such a scheme, and for making significant profits from it.'So, at one level, we are 
consistently urged to be efficient and be a business, with the provision of legal services opened up to every Tom 
Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly that, they are punished by the courts by being refused a lien.'I can see 
no logical difference between the pre-action road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and the scheme 
operated 
by 
Bott 
.... 
This 
decision 
should 
be 
overturned 
by 
the 
Supreme 
Court.'

unavailability of this aircraft. Ryanair is currently in talks with its staff, unions and 'affected airports' to decide on 
summer capacity cuts at a few other bases as well.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price

LONDON (AP) - Europe's busiest airline, budget carrier Ryanair, says it is closing bases in Nuremberg, Germany, 
and Stockholm, Sweden, because of delays to deliveries of Boeing 737 Max airplanes, which have been grounded 
for months over security concerns.
The company said in a statement Wednesday that it now expects to receive 10 aircraft rather than the 20 previously 
planned.
As a consequence, the low-cost carrier is predicting passenger traffic will drop from 157 million to 156 million.
The company says it expects to cut summer capacity in a number of other existing bases and is currently "in 
discussions with our people, our unions, and our affected airports to finalize these minor reductions.''

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) will not operate out of two bases this summer and reduce the number of its employees 
because of the delay in delivery of Boeing (BA) 737 MAX aircraft, Reuters reported on Wednesday. 
According to the report, the budget airline is planning to close its bases at Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavtsa in 
summer because it has only received 10 of the supposed 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries. The company also 
reduced its expected passenger load traffic forecast for full-year 2021 to 156 million from the previous 157 million 
guidance.
Ryanair earlier said it expects further delay to the delivery of its remaining aircraft units, Reuters said.

Ryanair Holdings Plc said on Wednesday it would receive just half of the planned 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft 
deliveries, leading to closure of two bases and cutting of its summer capacity at other bases, putting jobs at risk.
Europe's biggest budget airline said it would close its bases at Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta in the summer of 
2020. It revised its passenger load traffic forecast for full year 2021 to 156 million from 157 million stated earlier.
"We are continuing to work with Boeing, our people, our unions and our affected airports to minimise these capacity 
cuts and job losses," said Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair's main airline.
The company blamed the revision to its summer 2020 schedule on receiving just 10 MAX aircraft instead of 20 as 
previously planned.
Ryanair, one of Boeing's biggest customers, said in November it expects further delay to its Boeing MAX 737 
deliveries and may still be without the jets next summer. (Reuters)

Feeling the heat from the delay in the return of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, budget carrier Ryanair said Wednesday 
it will cut flights and trim jobs until the troubled plane is able to return to service.
The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two separate, fatal crashes killed a total of 346 passengers and 
crew.
In a statement, Ryanair said the flight cuts, job losses and suspended operations at airports in Nuremberg,

Budget carrier Ryanair is expecting to have only 10 Boeing 737 Max jets available for its summer 2020 season, a 
further cut in its capacity forecast for the season.
The airline had originally planned to operate 58 of the re-engined type next summer.
But it halved this to 30 after the grounding of the 737 Max in March, and subsequently cut its outlook again, to just 
20 aircraft, in November.
Ryanair has again pulled back the capacity forecast, expecting just 10 Max jets to be available for the summer 
season.
It says it has revised its schedule to account for the absence of the aircraft, and says the delays to delivery will 
"necessitate" the closure of it bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta in 2020.
The airline had positioned two and four aircraft at these bases respectively. Ryanair insists that the closures are 
"solely" due to the Max hold-up.
"We also expect to cut summer capacity in a number of other existing bases, and we are currently in discussions 
with our people, our unions, and our affected airports to finalise these minor reductions," says the carrier.
Ryanair is trimming its passenger number outlook to 156 million for the year to 31 March 2021.

RYANAIR headed to court yesterday in an attempt to prevent operations chief Peter Bellew from joining arch-rival 
Easyjet until 2021.
Europe's biggest budget airline said in July that the former Malaysia Airlines boss would step down at the end of the 
year.
But after Easyjet announced Bellew's appointment as its new chief operations officer a week later, Ryanair 
launched legal proceedings in Ireland's High Court.
Ryanair argued that all its senior executives commit to non-compete clauses barring them from joining a competitor 
for 12 months after leaving the Irish airline.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told reporters in September that the only issue was whether Bellew, who is currently 
working out his notice, can join Easyjet on 1 January 2020, or on the same date in 2021 - a full 18 months after 
Easyjet announced his appointment. An Easyjet spokeswoman declined to comment on the case. Bellew has not 
commented on the case since Ryanair initiated proceedings.
O'Leary has said the timing of Bellew's switch is sensitive because of the problems Ryanair is currently having with 
Boeing's grounded 737 Max jet.

Ryanair will stop operating in Nuremberg and Stockholm due to the delayed delivery of the new Boeing 737 Max 
airplanes. The long delays are good news for Boeing's rivals.Budget airline Ryanair announced Wednesday that it 
will be closing bases in Nuremberg and Stockholm. 
The decision was brought about by the delayed delivery of the Boeing 737 Max airplanes.The new model has been 
grounded for months over safety concerns, following the crash of two Boeing 737 Max planes within a few months 
of each other in 2018. In all, 346 people died in the crashes. In a statement, Ryanair said it expects to receive 10 
aircraft rather than the 20 that they originally ordered. Read more: Next time you fly for vacation, buy your right to

well and said it is "in discussions with our people, our unions, and our affected airports to finalize these minor 
reductions."The competition moves inThe 737 Max was supposed to replace many older Boeing models currently in 
use around the globe. But the model has remained on the ground since the 2018 crashes, which were at least 
partially caused by technical failures in the aircraft.An October report by a panel of international aviation experts 
harshly criticized Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration for the design and certification of the new 
Boeing model. The delay in clearing the 737 Max for flight has been a headache for many airlines as they seek to 
replace older models in their fleet. United Airlines announced Wednesday that it will replace several older models 
with new models from Boeing rival Airbus.Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

O'Leary has said the timing of Bellew's switch is sensitive because of the problems Ryanair is currently having with 
Boeing's grounded 737 MAX jet, which have slowed down its growth plans.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the MAX 737, with 210 on order, and the airline said last month it 
expected a further delay to deliveries that could leave it without the new jets next summer.
Ryanair tries to delay operations chief's flight to easyJet
Bellew left his role as CEO of Malaysia Airlines two years ago to return to Ryanair where he was director of flight 
operations before leaving for Kuala Lumpur in 2014.
Tasked with tackling a pilot revolt that resulted in Ryanair's first ever strikes, Bellew has helped patch up relations 
with staff and agree deals on pay and conditions with trade unions that have quelled the unrest.
An Irish national, Bellew described his return to Ryanair in 2017 as "a form of national service" to help what he 
described as Ireland's greatest company. Some observers had seen Bellew as a possible future Ryanair chief 
executive. (Reuters)

Dec 03, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive November traffic figures primarily owing to a solid demand for air travel. Traffic 
(including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit in Austria) rose 6% year over year to 11 million.However, load factor 
(% of seats filled with passengers) remained unaltered at 96%. This European low-cost carrier's passenger growth, 
excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was 4% in the month. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic increased 9% to 
151.6 million.Despite struggling with low capacity from the grounding of more fuel-efficient B737 MAX jets, the 
carrier's passenger traffic, on the whole, was consistently strong. 
Notably, traffic rose an impressive 11% in the first half of fiscal 2020 (ended Sep 30, 2019), resulting in revenue 
growth year over year.These apart, the carrier's efforts to reward its shareholders through buybacks are 
commendable. Ryanair returned more than €560 million to its shareholders through this investor-friendly measure in 
fiscal 2019. Continuing with the trend, the carrier returned €250 million to its shareholders through buybacks in the 
first half of fiscal 2020. Ryanair's efforts to repay debts apart from expanding its fleet size are encouraging as 
well.The company's initiatives to expand operations are an added positive. Its acquisition of Malta Air — a start-up 
carrier — earlier this year, is an example in this respect. The buyout has strengthened the carrier's foothold in 
Malta. The acquisition also allows Ryanairto operate flights from Malta to non-EU markets (North Africa).Backed by 
these tailwinds, shares of Ryanairhave outperformed its industry[2] on a year-to-date basis. The stock has gained 
15.8% compared with theindustry's 12.1% growth.Zacks Rank ...her Key PicksRyanaircarries a Zacks Rank #2

A new leasing platform led by former Ryanair chief financial officer (CFO) Howard Miller and backed by one of Abu 
Dhabi's largest sovereign wealth funds is to be established in Abu Dhabi.
Mubadala Investment Company will invest $100 million into Sirius Aircraft Investments, a new company being 
established by Sirius Aviation Capital in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial centre 
located on Al Maryah Island in the heart of Abu Dhabi.
The investment is being made through the Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners, a joint venture between Mubadala and US 
firm Falcon Edge Capital.
The Sirius team is led by Howard Millar who was Ryanair's CFO for 23 years.
Former Guinness Peat Aviation CFO Ed Hansom is Sirius Aircraft Investments' chief investment officer, Ed 
Coughlan is the chief commercial officer while Kieran Ryan is the CFO.
 "The world's aircraft fleet is expected to more than double over 20 years from 22,680 in 2019 to 47,680 aircraft by 
2038, so we see this as an excellent time to capitalise on the growing aviation market. This opportunity allows us to 
invest alongside Sirius Aviation Capital's experienced team, while also diversifying ADGM's focus across different 
sectors," said Guy Hurley, CEO of Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners.
"Sirius Aviation Capital and Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners aim to grow Sirius Aviation Investments into a leading mid-
life aircraft leaser. Through partnership and collaboration, supported by the first-class business infrastructure in Abu 
Dhabi, this new partnership is off to a strong start and we look forward to working together to achieve this ambition," 
said Millar.

Michael O'Leary is uncertain whether Ryanair will receive any Boeing 737 Max aircraft for the summer 2020 
season, the airline's chief executive has indicated to Reuters.
This contrasts with his view in October, when media heard he was "reasonably confident" that the Max would be 
flying for the airline by summer 2020.
However, at the time he also noted that as a result of the grounding the low-cost carrier (LCC) would retain the 
services for the summer 2020 period of seven of 10 737NGs it has sold to GECAS.
In his recent Reuters interview, O'Leary predicted that European regulator EASA would take longer re-approving 
the aircraft than the FAA, meaning that Ryanair could receive anything from zero to 15 aircraft for the summer 
season.
He added that the grounding was costing Ryanair about (EURO)100 million ($111 million) per year.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) currently expects not more than ten B737-8-200s before the peak 2020 summer season 
due to a recently discovered design issue, Chief Operating Officer Neal McMahon wrote in a memorandum to pilots. 
As reported separately by The Air Current and Aero.de, McMahon said the delay was related to an unspecified 
design issue with the second overwing exit. As a result, the Irish LCC now expects deliveries of the B737-8-200s to 
commence in May 2020 at the earliest, subject to the B737 MAX being ungrounded by all relevant authorities by 
that time.

IndiGo has received its IATA membership certificate, becoming the fourth Indian airline and the second low-cost 
operator from the country to join the association.
IATA membership will help the airline align with global practices developed by the association, as well as further 
strengthen its partnership portfolio and accelerate its international expansion, says IndiGo.
The association's members in India include Air India, SpiceJet and Vistara.
IndiGo, which operates almost 1,500 daily flights to 60 domestic and 23 international destinations with a fleet of 247 
aircraft, recently announced a one-way codeshare with Qatar Airways and partnered with Turkish Airlines last year 
to expand its international presence. This year the airline expanded into new international markets, including 
Turkey, Saudi Arabia, China, Myanmar and Vietnam.
“Being a member of IATA will help IndiGo grow its network faster by building relationships with other airlines,” says 
Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, IndiGo's president and chief operating officer.
The carrier is already an IOSA-registered airline and IATA Clearing House member.
IATA has gradually been adding low-cost carriers to its ranks over the last couple of years, although some of the 
largest LCCs, including AirAsia, EasyJet and Ryanair are not members.

Solicitors have been advising and assisting Bott ... Solicitors Ltd in relation to this matter.  Bott ... Solicitors Ltd have 
been granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court itself in relation to the issue of 
solicitors' liens where a third party - Ryanair here - deliberately sends damages to the client, and not the solicitor 
acting for the client. Very obviously that acts as a major disincentive to solicitors to take the risk of working on a no-
win, no-fee basis where there will be no fund from which to take the costs. 
It was thought that this issue had been put to bed by the Supreme Court itself in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v 
Haven Insurance Company Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[1]  where it held that Haven Insurance must pay to the solicitors 
the costs that were due to the solicitors from their own client in circumstances where the insurance company had 
paid damages direct to the solicitor's client. Any other decision would effectively render the Courts and Legal 
Services Act 1990, with its introduction of Conditional Fee Agreements, useless and remove the major current 
method of providing access to justice, following the removal of legal aid. Here, in Bott ... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair 
DAC [2019] EWCA Civ 143 [2] the Court of Appeal, in a decision bizarre even by its own recent anti-access to 
justice stance - (see Herbert v HH Law [2019] EWCA Civ 527[3] ) declined to follow the Supreme Court's decision 
in Edmondson, technically distinguishing it on grounds that would cause a first day trainee at my firm to get a 
rollicking. Had Ryanair's conduct been that of a solicitor it would be in clear, repeated and serious breach of the 
Solicitors Code of Conduct specifically indicative behaviour 11.4 which provides that you must ensure that you do 
not communicate with another party when you are aware that the other party has retained a lawyer in a matter, 
except:(a) to request the name and address of the other party's lawyer; or (b) the other party's lawyer consents to 
you communicating with the client; or (c) where there are exceptional circumstances.see my blog - SOLICITORS 
DENIED LIEN; THE RYANAIRCASE[4] After the Unison decision, where again the Supreme Court had to overturn 
an anti-access to justice Court of Appeal decision, this is the most important access to justice matter to go to the 
Supreme Court in recent years. I understand that the Law Society declined to intervene in relation to the Permission 
to Appeal[5] stage. It is to be hoped that the Law Society now takes a different view and intervenes in this matter of 
great importance to all solicitors - and most importantly their clients - whatever type of work is involved. Here is my 
comment on the Court of Appeal decision in this case.  The Senior Judiciary need to think through rather more 
carefully the whole issue of access to justice and litigation and how it may be delivered. At one level, lawyers are 
being encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and do everything to avoid litigation, and yetBott ... 
RYANAIR LIENS CASE GOES TO SUPREME COURT
SolicitorsLimitedappear to be being punished for using such a scheme, and for making significant profits from it. 
What on earth is the relevance to the legal principles of the fact that Bott's income from claims againstRyanairwas 
over 100,000 a month? (see Paragraph 16 of the judgment). What is the relevance of the number of claims that Bott 
were handling, except to show the success of the scheme and the attraction to members of the public? So, at one 
level, we are consistently urged to be efficient and be a business, with the provision of legal services opened up to 
every Tom Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly that they are punished by the courts by being refused a 
lien. I can see no logical difference between the pre-action road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and 
the scheme operated by Bott ... Solicitors Limited. This decision should be overturned by the Supreme Court. I deal 
with the decision of the High Court and the Supreme Court in my blogs - COURT REFUSES TO GRANT 
SOLICITOR LIEN FOR COSTS[6];and SOLICITORS' LIENS, RETAINERS, CFA LITE AND UNCONSCIONABLE

Nov 26, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Italian 
government is still searching for a financial solution to save struggling airline Alitalia, with Prime Minister Giuseppe 
Conte saying Tuesday that "We do not have a market solution within reach."Conte has said[1] that U.S.-based 
Delta Air Lines and the Italian state railway company Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane are still interested in financing the 
carrier. Delta has offered the equivalent of $110 million to save the airline, but the Italian government may not think 
that this is a sufficient amount.Last week, Rome-based infrastructure company Atlantia pulled out of a consortium 
that would invest in Alitalia. 
The Italian government is loaning the airline millions of euros as it searches for private funding.'The conditions that 
need to be met in order for Atlantia to be able to take part in a consortium, set up to put together a binding offer for 
Alitalia, do not as yet exist,' Atlantia said in statement.[2]Alitalia announced in April 2017 that the company is 
undergoing a bankruptcy process. Although the Italian government formally approved the company's request to file 
for bankruptcy a month later, it decided against nationalizing the airline.Budget airlines Easyjet and Ryanair have 
also previously been interested in buying the airline, but have decided against [3]purchasing the carrier.Alitalia was 
founded 
in 
March 
1999and 
is 
Italy's 
largest 
airline 
company.

Nov 26, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Airlines for America (A4A), the trade organization for leading U.S. airlines, predicted strong demand for air travel 
during the Thanksgiving holiday. Per A4A, 3.7% more passengers will be flying to various destinations in the 12-day 
travel period (Nov 22-Dec 3) this year compared to 2018.Meanwhile, American Airlines AAL[1] grabbed headlines 
by virtue of its decision to launch 20 seasonal routes for next year's summer. As the summer season is historically a 
busy one for airlines, the addition of new routes is expected to attract substantial traffic, and in turn, bolster 
American Airlines' top line.The past week also saw European low-cost carrier Ryanair RYAAY[2] ink a seven-year 
technology partnership with Vodafone Business, which is part of the Vodafone Group. Additionally, JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[3] entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) deal with Morgan Stanley to buy back $160 million 
worth of its stock. 
JetBlue aims to fund the repurchases with its available cash balance.(Read the lastAirline Stock 
Rounduphere[4])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. According to the forecast put forward by the 
Washington-based trade group, approximately 31.6 million passengers will travel on U.S. airlines during the 
Thanksgiving holiday period this year. The forecast implies that 2.63 million people will take to the skies per day 
compared with 2.55 million fliers per day in the same period last year. Moreover, Dec 1 is likely to be the busiest 
day for carriers ever, with 3.1 million people expected to take to the skies on that day.To meet the surge in travel 
demand, U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 108,000 per day. In fact, they will be 
operating 859 more flights a day during the period compared to 2018. (Read more: 3 Airline Stocks to Buy on A4A's 
Rosy Thanksgiving Forecast[5])2. As part of its decision to introduce additional routes for the summer of 2020, 
American Airlines intends to launch eight additional domestic routes. These routes will include flights connecting 
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Portland, Maine using an Airbus 319 aircraft. Flights on the route will 
operate on Saturdays from Jun 4 to Oct 3 next year. Other domestic route additions include flights connecting its 
East Coast hub — Philadelphia to Nantucket, Massachusetts, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts and Traverse 
City, Michigan. All three seasonal flights will be using an Embraer 175 on Saturdays from June, 2020. (Read more: 
American Airlines to Add Routes for Bolstering Summer Service[6])American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7].3. JetBlue has decided 
to accelerate some repurchases as part of its $800 million share buyback program announced in September, 2019. 
Airline Stock Roundup: A4A's Bullish Thanksgiving View, AAL 's Expansion Update More
Per the terms of ASR agreement with Morgan Stanley, the carrier will shell out $160 million and receive roughly 6.9 
million shares initially, based on its Nov 21 closing price. The total number of shares to be received by the carrier 
will be determined by the volume-weighted average prices of the JetBlue stock during the term of the ASR 
agreement. After settlement of the transaction, the carrier will have $640 million of its share buyback authorization 
remaining.4. Strengthening their partnership further, Ryanair chose Vodafone Business as its partner in the field of 
technology communications in Europe. Per the new agreement, Vodafone Business will transform Ryanair's 
information and communication technology infrastructure by applying its cloud, unified communications, software-
defined wide area network (SD-WAN), Internet of Things (IoT) and security services. The UK mobile company will 
manage services like online booking, passenger boarding and in-flight transactions for the Irish carrier in Europe. 
Per the deal, Vodafone Business will support 300 Ryanair sites and roughly 153 million passengers across 40 
countries. The deal should encourage a faster turnaround of planes apart from offering other facilities, which in turn, 
might boost Ryanair's profitability.5. In a bid to boost the travel experience of its passengers, Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[8] has collaborated with Twentieth Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios to celebrate an animated spy 
comedy adventure — Spies in Disguise — slated to release on Dec 25, 2019. To this end, Allegiant aims to launch 
a newly-designed aircraft with a Spies in Disguise-themed livery wrapping the exterior. The plane, based at 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, will feature larger-than-life images of the film's lead characters.

Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images An Air Canada Boeing 787-8 flight had to turn round mid-flight after the crew 
spotted a crack in the windshield. Flight AC857 was due to fly from London to Toronto but was forced to land in 
Dublin, Ireland because of the incident. The flight had already flown beyond Ireland and was over the Atlantic 
Ocean when the crack was spotted, flight data from tracking website FlightRadar24 shows.[1] The passengers were 
all put on a different flight the next day, while the plane was repaired and put back into service, aviation news 
website Simple Flying reported[2]. Other 787 flights have also experienced cracks windshields, forcing the planes to 
land. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. An Air Canada Boeing 787 plane that was flying across the 
Atlantic from London to Toronto had to land in Dublin after its windscreen cracked mid-flight. Flight AC 857 had 
already flown past Ireland and was around one hour into the flight on Saturday when crew noticed the crack, 
aviation news website Simple Flying reported[4]. The plane, a 787-8 model, then turned around and landed in 
Dublin, Ireland's capital, 55 minutes later, according to Simple Flying. Data from flight tracking website 
FlightRadar24[5] shows the plane's abrupt u-turn on finding the crack:The passengers were put on a different 787-8 
plane to continue on to Toronto the following day. Simple Flying reported that the plane with the crack was repaired 
and flown back to Canada after repairs in Dublin. The plane, with a tail number of C-GHQY, is now back in regular 
service, according to the outlet. Other Boeing 787 planes have experienced cracked windshields, including a Jetstar 
Boeing 787-8 plane[6] that was diverted to Melbourne, Australia while en route to Indonesia in September. Boeing 
did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the Air Canada flight, and the 
broader issue of cracked windscreens on 787 aircraft. The incidents have also previously involved Air Canada. In 
September, a flight from Shanghai to Vancouver[7] was diverted to Tokyo after a crack appeared. Air Canada said 
after that flight that the landing was precautionary because the windows have two panes of glass. Boeing is also 
currently dealing with a separate cracking problem in its 737 plane model,[8]where cracks have appeared on an 
area of some of the planes called the pickle fork, which connects the plane body, wing structure, and landing gear. 
This has led some airlines, like Ryanair[9] and Qantas, to ground some of the planes after they found cracks during 
inspections.NOW WATCH: Here's why in-flight WiFi is so slow and expensive[10]See Also: Boeing quietly unveiled

Ryanair 's hand luggage fee is "abusive" says Spanish court

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) was told on November 20 by a Spanish court that its policy of charging a hand luggage 
fee was "abusive" and should not be levied any more in the country, according to a report on Reuters. Ryanair 
charges some of its passengers an additional fee on top of its ticket price for taking more than one small personal 
bag into the cabin. However, the judge presiding over the case ruled that the hand luggage, by size and weight, 
could be easily carried in the cabin, and pointed to a Spanish regulation that allows passengers to take hand 
luggage on board at no additional cost. The judge went further, saying the charge "curtailed the rights that 
passenger has recognised by law" and declared it invalid in Spain.

Highlight: 3 THINGS THAT WILL CHANGE THE WORLD TODAYGood morning, here's your Thursday morning 
briefing to set you up for the day ahead. Look out for these three things happening around the world today.
Body
Startups head to Helsinki for Slush 2019Entrepreneurs, investors and researchers head to Helsinki, Finland, today 
to hear from the hottest startups seeking to change the world. Launched in 2008, Slush has gathered larger crowds 
with each year to become the world's leading startup event. In 2018, people attended, including 2,600 startups. 
This year's speakers include John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe, Markus Villig, founder and CEO of 
Bolt and Ines Ures, chief marketing officer at Deliveroo. The two-day event takes place at the Helsinki Exhibition & 
Conference Centre. The Economist publishes World in 2020 editionThe Economist today publishes its annual 
special edition taking a look at the biggest trends likely to shape the year ahead. Last year it predicted that the 
biggest story of 2019 would be the 'Battle for Europe'. This centred on the European Parliamentary elections and 
the "fragmentation of European politics", not just the UK's prolonged divorce from the European Union. The World 
in 2020 will explore the trends shaping politics, business, finance, science and technology. Possible topics may 
include the 2020 presidential campaign, urban air mobility, 5G and, of course, Brexit. Obama speaks at 
DreamforceBarack Obama will speak at Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual conference, in San Francisco, US. The 
44th president of the United States will spend an hour talking on stage with Salesforce chairman and co-CEO Marc 
Benioff. The conference focuses on cloud computing technology solutions, partner solutions and services. 
Dreamforce's star-studded line-up also includes a keynote from US Women's National Team caption Megan 
Rapinoe, Apple CEO Tim Cook and actor Emilia Clarke. The four-day conference takes place at the Moscone 
Center and concludes on Friday. Wednesday's HighlightsWhat is juice jacking and should you stop phone charging

Spanish court bans Ryanair luggage charge

RYANAIR's policy of charging customers for hand luggage has been ruled "abusive" by a Spanish court, and 
subsequently banned in the country.
The charge, introduced last year, forces passengers to pay an extra fee if they want to bring anything more than 
one personal item into the cabin.
However, it led a passenger travelling from Madrid to Brussels to take the budget flyer to court, after staff forced her 
to pay (EURO)20 (£17), to bring 10 kilograms of luggage onto the plane.
Yesterday, the court ordered the airline to refund her the (EURO)20 on top of interest.
The judge characterised the charge as abusive, adding that it "curtailed the rights that the passenger has 
recognised by law", and declared it invalid in Spain.
"This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, as it misquoted the European Court of Justice and 
misinterpreted the airlines' commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage," Ryanair said.

It was announced today that Ryanair has chosen Vodafone Business as its technology communications partner in 
Europe.
Vodafone says the new seven-year agreement builds on an existing relationship and focuses on the experience of 
Ryanair’s customers in reaching their destinations on time.
Under the agreement, Vodafone Business will work on Ryanair’s information and communication technology (ICT) 
infrastructure using every part of Vodafone Business’ solutions - including cloud, unified communications, software-
defined wide area network (SD-WAN), Internet of Things (IoT) and security services.
Vodafone Business will support 300 Ryanair sites and some 200 million passengers across 40 countries, meaning 
that up to 95% of Ryanair’s telecoms will be managed directly by Vodafone Business. This includes the hosting of 
its core infrastructure that maintains Ryanair’s core business processes from online booking, passenger boarding 
and in-flight transactions, to training centres, offices and data centres.
This new agreement also represents Vodafone’s largest rollout of SD-WAN to date which is being managed in 
Ireland for delivery across 40 countries.
Speaking this week, CEO of Vodafone Ireland, Anne O’Leary said, "By working closely with Ryanair, our technical, 
product and account management teams in Vodafone Business will deliver against their business and technology 
requirements over the next seven years through the utilisation of our full portfolio of products and services."
Ryanair and Vodafone sign technology partnership
Chief Technology Officer at Ryanair, John Hurley added, "Over the last 30 years, Ryanair has revolutionised and 
democratised air travel for European citizens, growing to become Europe’s largest airline with the widest route 
network, connecting more than 200 destinations in 40 countries on the lowest fares."

A Spanish court on Wednesday ruled budget carrier Ryanair's policy of charging an extra fee for hand luggage was 
"abusive" and could no longer be levied in Spain.
The ruling stemmed from a passenger complaint over the policy, introduced last year, which charges most people 
an additional fee for bringing anything more than one personal item into the cabin.
Ryanair was not immediately available for comment.
The passenger, traveling from Madrid to Brussels, went to court after airline staff forced her to pay 20 euros to bring 
her 10 kilo luggage on board.
The court ordered Ryanair to refund her the 20 euros plus interest, but rejected her demand for compensation of a 
further 10 euros for the suffering she experienced, according to court documents.
The judge ruled that the hand luggage, by size and weight, could be easily carried in the cabin, pointing to a 
Spanish regulation that allows passengers to take hand luggage on board at no additional cost.
The judge characterized the charge as abusive, adding that it "curtailed the rights that the passenger has 
recognized by law," and declared it invalid in Spain.
She rejected the demand for compensation, however, saying that while doubtless "the passenger suffered rage and 
powerlessness in having to pay the extra unforeseen cost at the time of boarding" the discomfort did not reach a 
level that would justify compensation.

Nov 20, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Spanish court 
has ordered Ryanair to refund a customer who was charged for taking a carry-on bag without a special ticket, and 
told the airline to remove the clause from its terms and conditions.In a ruling issued last month but only published 
Wednesday, the Commercial Court said the budget carrier must repay the 20-euro ($22) fee plus interest it had 
imposed on a female passenger flying from Madrid to Brussels for taking a small suitcase of up to 10 kilos (22 
lbs).Ryanair only allows small bags into the cabin if they can be stowed under the seat in front, but larger bags of up 
to 10 kilos require a luggage fee, or a fee-paying priority boarding pass.In its ruling, which cannot be appealed, the 
court described the airline's cabin baggage policy as "abusive" in respect to the customer's legal rights under 
Spanish law. Italy's antitrust authorities fined Ryanair and Wizzair over their cabin baggage policies, but a court 
later cancelled the fines Photo: AFP / Alberto PIZZOLI  It declared Ryanair's cabin baggage policy to be null and 
void and ordered the airline "to remove it" from its terms and conditions.There was no immediate response from the 
Dublin-based airline.In February, Italy's antitrust authority fined Ryanair three million euros and Hungary's Wizzair 
one million euros over their cabin baggage policy on grounds it was tantamount to raising ticket prices in a "non-
transparent" manner.But last month, an Italian court cancelled the fines following an appeal by the two airlines.

Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief pilot, has announced all flights from now on will be carbon neutral. At £25m a year, 
the projected cost of the offset scheme is surprisingly low. Shares rose because yesterday's annual results were 
decent, not because the planet has been saved.
Climate change does not currently hang over airlines as threateningly as it does oil companies. The question for 
investors is whether that will change. Aviation is a top 10 producer of carbon, according to the Environmental 
Defense Fund. That will go up as people fly more.
Stripped of technical guff, offset schemes work like this. You give some money to an environmental charity. You 
then feel less guilty about flying. The amount of carbon dioxide offset by the scheme will be debatable.
The cheaper the scheme, the greater the doubt. For example, easyJet says it paying enough, worth about 5 per 
cent of PBT annually, to offset its carbon for three years. But that would work out at (EURO)0.26 per passenger last 
year.
This voluntary offset is worth £2.87 per tonne of carbon dioxide. The EU's Emission Trading System prices CO2 at 
about (EURO)24 per tonne for 2020. EasyJet paid £80m last year under the ETS. That covered less than half its 
emissions. Full coverage would have cost £180m, according to Bernstein.
EasyJet /CO2: that sinking feeling Twitter : @FTLex
The airline promises its projects will be fully vetted to ensure a complete emissions offset. Good idea. Ryanair has 
been criticised for an offset scheme whose beneficiaries quaintly included a cetacean charity.
There is less ambiguity about easyJet's earnings. They have fallen. Statutory profits before tax dropped 3.7 per 
cent to £430m. EasyJet is in the middle of an investment splurge that does not peak until after 2020. That puts 
pressure on its finances - net cash has reversed into net debt - just when the added liabilities from the IFRS 16 
change weigh on the balance sheet.
Mr Lundgren thinks revenue per available seat will rise perhaps by midsingle digits next year. His sales predictions 
are more convincing than his offsetting scheme. The supply of genuine carbon sink projects is limited. Their price 
would rise, as would fares, if airlines were serious about climate change.
It is a conundrum you cannot offset.

Nov 20, 2019( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
budget airline's policy is now null and void in Spain following a passenger's complaint. However, Ryanair has 
indicated it may not follow the ruling.A Spanish court on Wednesday ruled Ryanair could no longer charge an extra 
fee for hand luggage in the Iberian country.The court termed it "abusive" after a passenger complained following a 
trip from Madrid to Brussels. 
She then took the airline to court over the incident after airline staff forced her to pay €20 ($22) to bring her 10 
kilogram (22 pound) luggage on board.The court ordered the Dublin-based airline to refund her the €20 plus 
interest, but turned down the passenger's request for an additional €10 in compensation.Read more: Ryanair risks 
loss if Boeing 737 Max remains groundedImmediate changeThe ruling, which cannot be appealed, means the 
budget airline's cabin baggage policy is now null and void and states the airline must "remove it" from its terms and 
conditions.Until now, Ryanair only allows small bags into the cabin if they can be placed under the seat in front, but 
larger bags of up to 10 kilograms incur a fee, or a priority boarding pass which customers must also pay for.In 
November 2018,the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (vzbv) accused Ryanair of providing 
misleading information and insufficient pricing information about its cabin bag policy.Possible flouting of the new 
rulingThe Irish company hinted that it may ignore the Spanish court's decision when it released a statement in 
response saying: "This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, as it misquoted the (European Court of 
Justice) and misinterpreted the airlines' commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage."When 
asked if it was planning to carry on regardless or appeal the ruling in the European Court of Justice, the airline 
declined to comment.jsi/aw (AFP, Reuters)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the

group of Danish travel agents and journalists from Jutland helped to christen the inaugural Billund (in Jutland) to 
Dublin, as part of a promotional campaign by Tourism Ireland, Filte Ireland and Ryanair. 
The aim of the visit was to highlight the new Ryanair flight and ease of access to people living in Jutland. The trip 
was also an opportunity to showcase Ireland's tourism offering and some of the things to see and do in Ireland for 
Danish travellers. The journalists will be sharing their experiences, in various online and print publications, to their 
combined audience of around 838,000 readers. The itinerary included Malahide Castle and Gardens, Slane Castle 
and Slane Distillery, Croke Park, the Guinness Storehouse, Glasnevin Cemetery Museum, the Little Museum of 
Dublin and the Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI). Julie McLaughlin, Tourism Ireland's Manager for the Nordic 
Region, said: 'We were delighted to invite these travel agents and journalists to visit Ireland. It's an opportunity to 
promote the new Ryanair flight from Billund to Dublin, as well as some of our visitor attractions. 'The new Ryanair 
flight between Billund and Dublin is good news for Irish tourism, particularly as we aim to grow tourism business in 
the shoulder and off-season months. We look forward to co-operating with Ryanair to maximise the promotion of 
this new service.'

European pilot group demands action over Ryanair sick leave policy
European pilot group demands action over Ryanair sick leave policy
Business World (Digest)

The European Cockpit Association (ECA) pilot group has urged regulators to take action over what it described as a 
"safety hazard" caused by Ryanair's approach to flight crews' sick leave, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Europe's largest budget carrier has spent the last two years negotiating improved pay and conditions with its pilots 
and cabin crew after a revolt by some staff forced it to recognize trade unions for the first time.
The ECA, which represents pilots' associations in 33 European countries, said Ryanair adopts a practice of 
systematically questioning absences due to certified sickness, leading to investigative and disciplinary meetings 
where staff are threatened with potential dismissal.
Asked about the ECA's concerns, a Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline operates "a standard sick pay scheme, 
and like all employers, manages absenteeisms."
The airline, which has never had a fatal crash and has one of the youngest fleets in Europe, regularly cites safety 
as its top priority.
The ECA said it raised the issue with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) a year ago but that 
Ryanair's "problematic approach" to flight crew's sickness has not substantially changed.
"In fact, we are concerned that the safety hazard created by this approach remains fully in place, must be 
considered endemic, and quite evidently is not adequately addressed by the competent national authority: the Irish 
Aviation Authority (IAA)," the letter dated Nov. 5 said.
European pilot group demands action over Ryanair sick leave policy
A spokeswoman for the ECA confirmed it had sent such a letter to the regulator, the second in a year, and that it 
was concerned that the safety hazard related to Ryanair's policy remains unaddressed.
In the letter, the ECA said it was aware that the EASA raised the matter with the IAA following the initial complaint 
but that the Irish regulator told one of the ECA's member groups that it was satisfied there was not a systematic 
issue of crews flying while unfit due to fear of sanction at Ryanair.
The IAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Citing letters sent to staff, the ECA said Ryanair or broker agencies overseeing agency workers used by the airline 
have gone as far as threatening to halt pilots' career progression, due to their sickness rate.
The pilot group called on the European regulator to ensure the IAA adequately fulfills its safety oversight role by 
summoning Ryanair to stop the practice of intimidating letters and investigative proceedings and also carry out an 
independent confidential survey among Ryanair crew. (Reuters)

Ryanair logo A number of firms have modified their ratings and price targets on shares of Ryanair (NASDAQ: 
RYAAY) recently: 
•
11/14/2019 - Ryanair  was downgraded by analysts at BNP Paribas from a "neutral" rating to an 
"underperform" rating.
•
11/7/2019 - Ryanair  was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a "hold" rating to a 
"buy" rating. They now have a $89.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, "Shares of Ryanair 
have underperformed its industry in a year due to multiple headwinds such as labor unrest, Boeing 737 
MAX groundings and high labor costs. Management stated while releasing second-quarter fiscal 2020 
results that the delivery of its first B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been delayed yet again and now it expects 
the jet delivery in March/April 2020. Moreover, weak airfares (down 5% in first-half fiscal 2020) are denting 
the company s profitability. High labor costs are also hurting Ryanair s bottom line. However, the increase 
in traffic bodes well for Ryanair. Notably, an 11% rise in traffic led to 11% growth in revenues in first-half 
fiscal 2020. Initiatives to add shareholder value are encouraging too. Efforts to widen its base are 
commendable as well. The buyout of Malta Air is in line with Ryanair &#39;s plans to expand."
•
11/5/2019 - Ryanair had its price target raised by analysts at Raymond James from $80.00 to $90.00. They 
now have an "outperform" rating on the stock.
•
11/5/2019 - Ryanair  was upgraded by analysts at HSBC Holdings plc from a "reduce" rating to a "hold" 
rating.
•
11/5/2019 - Ryanair  was downgraded by analysts at Deutsche Bank AG from a "buy" rating to a "hold" 
rating.
•

SHARES in Stobart Group fell almost five per cent yesterday after the company said it would suspend its dividend 
in order to pump money into growing both its aviation and biomass energy divisions.
The group reported strong revenue growth for the first half of the year, with an increase of over a third to £93.1m.
This increase was driven by a strong performance from London Southend Airport, which the group owns, and 
Stobart Energy. Chief executive Warwick Brady said both businesses had "immediate and considerable growth 
opportunities".
Passenger numbers at Stobart Aviation, the division that owns Southend Airport, reported 42 per cent growth in 
passenger number to 1.2m as budget carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air joined Easyjet as partners.
The volume of waste managed by Stobart Energy increased by over a fifth during the first six months of the year, 
while the division's revenue rose 43.5 per cent.
Overall, Stobart's loss widened al-most 20 per cent, hitting £20.9m for the first half.
Brady said the group's energy and aviation businesses "require further investment in order to deliver their full 
potential".
"[We have] taken the decision to suspend the dividend in order to maximise the capital available for the further 
development of these growth businesses," he added. "We are confident that, with the planned strategic investment, 
we will deliver superior future returns," he added.
Stobart Group's shares fall after dividend halted
The group said it was planning to restore the dividend when Stobart "becomes significantly cash generative at an 
operating level".
Shares fell 4.8 per cent to 117.15p.

Nov 15, 2019( ValueWalk: http://www.valuewalk.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  More people are scratching their 
travel itch than ever before. But most airlines don't offer affordable air travel. Budget travelers are always hunting 
for cheap air tickets for their next adventure. Fortunately for them, Skytrax has published its 2019 ranking[1] of the 
world's top 10 best budget airlines that offer services similar to premium airlines at affordable prices. They make it 
possible for anyone to travel for as low as 11 cents per mile.

source: 
StockSnap / Pixabay[2] Skytrax[3] compiled the list after conducting an international survey across nine months 
from September 2018 to May 2019. The survey was conducted in six different languages - English, French, 
Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.10- EurowingsEurowings is the low-cost subsidiary of German giant 
Lufthansa. It commenced operations in 1994. Eurowings offers cheap in-flight food and drinks. It serves almost all 
major European cities, and has been increasing its long-haul portfolio in recent years. Eurowings was originally a 
regional carrier that shifted focus to budget-friendly travel in 2014.9- RyanAirThe Iris budget airline began 
operations in 1984. RyanAir claims to offer Europe's lowest fares. It is one of the largest budget airlines in Europe 
with a fleet of more than 400 aircraft. It serves 38 countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle-East.7- 
IndiGoFounded in 2005, IndiGo is India's largest carrier. It has a fleet of 167, and carries close to 50 million 
passengers a year. IndiGo has placed a massive order for more than 400 aircraft with Airbus. IndiGo has not only 
been enhancing regional connectivity in India, but also expanding flights to international destinations such as 
Singapore, Bangkok, and Dubai.7- WestJetWestJet is the largest low-cost carrier in Canada. Founded in 1996, 
WestJet flies to numerous destinations across North America and Europe. Despite its low airfares, WestJet is 
known for convenience, quality, and passenger safety. It has also launched another low-cost airline brand called 
Swoop, which currently serves only a small number of destinations.6- Jetstar AirwaysJetstar is the no-frills 
subsidiary of Australia's flagship carrier Qantas Airways. Jetstar is not only one of the best budget airlines, but also 
offers flights to almost all the popular tourist destinations in the South Pacific region. Most budget airlines are 
notorious for baggage fees and delayed flights, but Jetstar is much better than its peers in these departments.5- 
AirAsia XFor some reason, Skytrax has listed AirAsia X and AirAsia separately. AirAsia X is the long-haul arm of 
the AirAsia group. It operates flights that takes longer than four hours of flying time. It flies to most major cities in 
Asia, but has limited flights to European destinations. According to a recent study[4], AirAsia X is the world's 
cheapest airline in terms of cost per mile.4- Southwest AirlinesSouthwest is one of the most reliable[5] airlines in the 
These are the world's top 10 best budget airlines of 2019
United States. It has also been ranked among the world's best airlines by TripAdvisor[6]. Southwest has been 
praised for its excellent customer service, low fares, safety, and convenience. Southwest has a fleet of more than 
700 aircraft but it flies only in North America and the Caribbean.3- Norwegian Air ShuttleNorwegian is the largest 
airline in Norway. Though the company commenced operations in 1993, it became a low-cost carrier in 2002. It 
started flying to long-haul destinations in 2013. The carrier flies to major destinations in Europe, North America, 
South America, and Asia. Despite its low airfare, Norwegian is known for offering quality service.2- 
EasyJetFounded in 1995, EasyJet is the most popular low-cost airline in the United Kingdom. It carries more than 
80 million passengers to more than 150 destinations in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle-East. EasyJet is 
undoubtedly one of the best budget airlines in the world, but it's not so good with claims processing and on-time 
performance.1- AirAsiaAirAsia has been named the world's best budget airline for the 11th consecutive year by 
Skytrax. AirAsia has a fleet size of 254, and flies to 165 destinations across Asia and Australia. It is the largest 
airline in Malaysia. Its airfare is as low as 11 cents per mile. If you want a better flying experience without breaking 
the bank, AirAsia offers premium economy travel as well. It operates flights to destinations that are within four hours 
of flight time. [ 1]:            https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-best-low-cost-airlines-2019/ [ 2]:

Fog enshrouding East Midlands airport prevented tower controllers from realising that a parking stand was occupied 
by a Jet2 Boeing 737-300, before the jet was struck by a Ryanair 737-800 taxiing past it.
The Ryanair aircraft, arriving from London Stansted on 30 April, had been cleared to follow the shortest path to 
stand S22.
This meant passing behind the Jet2 aircraft on stand S24. This aircraft did not show up on the surface-movement 
radar display.
Low-visibility procedures were in place at the time, with runway visual range down to just 300-325m, and the fog 
made the Jet2 aircraft "invisible" to air traffic controllers, says the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
"Had visibility been better, [controllers] would have had an opportunity to visually acquire the obstruction and offer a 
different route [to the Ryanair crew]," it adds.
Although the Jet2 aircraft was correctly parked, the short 737-300 was occupying a position normally intended for a 
737-800 – a larger aircraft, which might have made the lack of clearance more obvious to the Ryanair crew.
The inquiry says aeronautical information charts did not indicate that clearance could be compromised, and even 
though the Ryanair crew was aware of the narrow margin and kept to the taxiway guidance line, the 737-800's right 
winglet sliced into the Jet2 aircraft's horizontal stabiliser.
"Commercial flight crew routinely operate on airfields where following established taxiway markings generates safe 
separation," says the inquiry. "Repeated achievement of safe outcomes through compliance builds confidence and 
trust that airfield markings are safe to follow."

Investigators also point out that previous probes have highlighted the limitations of the human eye in judging 
relative distance at ranges above 10m. This perception problem is increased, it says, on aircraft equipped with 
blended, rather than angular, wing-tips.
East Midlands airport's operator subsequently closed stand S22 pending a safety review and surveyed other 
parking stands to identify similar separation risks. Both carriers involved also alerted crews to the hazard of reduced 
separations with certain stands at the airport.

Budget carrier battle boosts Vienna Airport's profit

Vienna Airport's net profit rose by 14.4 per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters, as budget airlines are 
seeking to expand market share in this major hub for Central and Eastern European destinations.
Net profit reached 152 million euros (167 million dollars), while revenues rose by 7.8 per cent to 643 million euros in 
the period between January and September, the airport reported on Thursday.
Lufthansa subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Eurowings, as well as budget carriers Lauda, Wizz Air and Level have 
increased their passenger volumes and the number of flights in Vienna.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary announced in September that his company's subsidiary Lauda plans to 
overtake Austrian Airlines as Vienna's dominant carrier in five years, as part of his battle plan against Lufthansa.
While the airport is profiting from the competition, Austrian Airlines has been suffering and announced last week 
that it would cut its workforce by up to 800 until 2021.
Austrian Airlines chief executive Alexis von Hoensbroech said that the number of available budget carrier seats in 
Vienna would rise from 4.5 million this year to 7 million next year.

Budapest-based low-cost carrier Wizz Air has posted sharply higher first-half profits as it continues to cut unit cost 
and increase passenger numbers.
Across the first six months of 2019, the airline carried 22 million people – 18% more than in the same period last 
year – helped by aggressive expansion in its core market.
This pushed profits for the period up to 372 million, an 85% increase on the first half of 2018.
Operating expenses increased roughly in line with the growth in passenger numbers. Although the airline's fuel bill 
rose by 5.2% year on year, cost per available seat-kilometre continued to tick lower.
Safety issues that have grounded the Beoing 737 Max aircraft type have led to capacity problems at airlines across 
Europe, but as Wizz operates an Airbus-only fleet it has been able to maintain rapid expansion. It launched 76 new 
routes in the first half.
Wizz also tends to operate slightly larger aircraft types compared with its peers, such as the Airbus A321, which 
Wizz fits with 230 seats, against a capacity of 189 passengers on a Ryanair Boeing 737-800.
The airline credits these aircraft with helping to drive its cost base down against its competitors, and expects its cost 
advantages to widen as it takes on more of these larger aircraft. Wizz has 268 aircraft on order, it says, including 20 
medium-range A321XLR jets ordered during the first half.
"Wizz Air again reports all-time high financial results for the first half of our current financial year as our low-
fare/low-cost business model delivered an 18% increase in passenger numbers, higher load factors, strong cost 
and yield performance, ex-fuel unit cost down 3%, and unit revenue up 3% year-on-year,” states chief executive 
Jozsef Varadi.
Wizz profit jumps on firmer margins Budapest-based low-cost carrier Wizz Air has posted sharply higher first-
half profits as it continues to cut unit cost and i....
He asserts that Wizz is "the lowest cost producer in the industry in Europe and the largest airline in the growing 
CEE [central and eastern Europe] market, making us a long-term structural winner in the aviation sector".
Wiizz expects that second-half growth will accelerate 22% and has adjusted its full-year guidance from 320-350 
million to 335-350 million.

The US Federal Aviation Administration has mandated that airlines with Boeing 737NG aircraft that have completed 
a high rate of flight cycles must re-inspect hardware known as "pickle forks" that connect a wing to a fuselage.
Boeing notified the FAA that one operator found a crack outside of the original section of the fuselage the FAA had 
mandated for inspection in October.
Today, the FAA published an airworthiness directive requiring that 737NGs that have completed 30,000 flight cycles 
be re-inspected within 60 days, expanding the initial search area for cracks from two fasteners to eight fasteners on 
each side of the aircraft. Carriers must inspect 737NGs that have completed 22,600 flight cycles within their next 
1,000 flight cycles. The order impacts US-registered 737NGs, including -600, -700, -800 and -900 series aircraft.
The additional inspections are underway, Boeing says in a statement.
"We regret the impact to our customers and have a repair plan in place to address any findings," Boeing states. 
"Less than 5% of the 1,200 airplanes that have undergone the initial inspection were found to have the cracking 
issue. The secondary issue has been discovered on three in-service airplanes and one airplane that was 
undergoing maintenance in preparation for a modification."
Replacing pickle forks can be costly also because aircraft interiors must be stripped out, including side panels and 
fixtures.
The FAA ordered the original inspections on 2 October after Boeing discovered cracks on pickle fork hardware of 
737-800s undergoing passenger-to-freighter conversions in China.

Airlines impacted include Qantas, Ryanair, Southwest Airlines, Gol, and Indonesian carriers Sriwijaya Air and 
Garuda.

RYANAIR has been named as the filthiest flight operator in the UK by passengers, according to a Which survey.
Having surveyed 7,901 people who had taken 12,459 flights between them, more than half rated hygiene in Ryanair 
plane cabins negatively.
Of the 42 airlines surveyed, 81 per cent of passengers on average found cleanliness was at a good level, but for 
Ryanair it was just 42 per cent.
A quarter of customers were "unhappy" with the poor levels of hygiene on the Irish budget airline.
A Which investigator used an ultraviolet light to examine a Ryanair plane cabin and found "greasy tray tables, soiled 
headrests and dusty window sills".
It also showed up stains that could be seen by the naked eye.
Rory Boland, Which travel editor, said: "It is unacceptable for some airlines to be cutting corners when it comes to 
cleaning out their cabins properly, no matter how cheap the airline ticket.
WizzAir received positive feedback from 62 per cent of passengers, while rival Easyjet had 68 per cent of 
passengers rate the hygiene levels as "good", "very good" or "excellent".

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/uk-passengers-expose-the-dirtiest-airlines-in-new-survey/Ryanair has been 
named the filthiest flight operator in the UK by passengers, according to a Which? Travel survey.In the survey fewer 
than half of passengers scored the Irish budget airline as good for cleanliness. 
In contrast, the survey found that on average, eight in 10 of passengers rated hygiene positively across 42 airlines. 
But Ryanair customers were unhappy, with a quarter claiming cleanliness on flights was poor. A Which? 
investigator who used an ultraviolet light to examine the cleanliness on a Ryanair flight was greeted by greasy tray 
tables, soiled headrests and dusty window sills upon boarding. Meanwhile, the ultraviolet light showed up stains on 
the tray tables that could not be seen by the naked eye. Rory Boland, Which? Travel editor, said: 'Faster and faster 
turnarounds are one thing but it is unacceptable for some airlines to be cutting corners when it comes to cleaning 
out their cabins properly - no matter how cheap the airline ticket. 'There are steps you can take; either choose your 
next flight on an airline that has a good track record for cleanliness or equip yourself with some antibacterial wipes. 
'If you are flying Ryanair though, a biohazard suit might be more appropriate.' While Ryanair was not the only airline 
to be criticised for its hygiene, it was significantly worse than the other airlines included in the survey. Many 
customers of WizzAir were also less than impressed with its cleaning, with only six in 10 finding the cleanliness to 
be good. The scores were hardly better for those who chose to fly with Vueling or Iberia, with 63% of passengers 
being satisfied with the cleanliness. Around two-thirds of easyJet passengers rated the cleanliness as 'good', 'very 
good' or 'excellent'. British Airways was also in passengers' good books with three in four being pleased with the 
airline's hygiene. Easyjet on the other hand was rated as 'good', 'very good' or 'excellent' for cleanliness Nearly all 
of the passengers who flew with Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific and 
Swiss told Which? that they found the cleanliness on board to be good. Last year, research conducted by 
Marketplace, a Canadian TV show, revealed the grim reality of the various types of bacteria, mould and yeast that 
are on planes. After analysing more than 100 samples collected on 18 domestic Canadian flights, scientists 
discovered that headrests were the most contaminated place on a plane. Offering tips to passengers on how to 
protect themselves, Which? advised washing hands before eating, carrying a hand sanitiser gel and avoiding 
touching your eyes, mouth or nose while on board. Read more: UK passengers expose the dirtiest airlines in new

Ryanair struck a cautious tone in its half-year report, decrying the "unreliable optimism of some competitors" 
Ryanair has cut the target range for its full-year post-tax profits, with Boeing 737 Max disruption, rising fuel costs 
and spiralling losses in the airline's Lauda outfit expected to weigh on earnings.
In July, Ryanair cut the number of 737 Max-200 jets it expected to receive for the summer of 2020 from 58 to 30. 
The planes remain grounded after two software-related crashes, and Ryanair has now cut this further to 20 aircraft.
Subject to regulatory approval, the airline expects to receive the planes in March or April, although it added the 
caveat that "the risk of further delay is rising".
The planes, which are more uel-efficient, were expected to elp Ryanair achieve cost savings - these will not now be 
achieved until 2021.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "We have already reduced our passenger growth expectation next year from 
7 to 3 per cent. We may have to cut that again."
Full-year losses for Ryanair's Lauda brand will exceed expectations, which Ryanair attributed to overcapacity in 
Austria and Germany.
Ryanair also envisages a (EURO)450m (£389m) rise in its fuel bill. The airline has narrowed its full-year guidance 
for post-tax profits accordingly to a new range of (EURO)800m-(EURO)900m.
Ryanair ( RYA )
The airline continues to be hamstrung by its Boeing order, and admits that growth in passenger traffic is vulnerable 
to market uncertainty. We see no significant catalysts for share price growth that would tempt us to upgrade our 
rating. Alex Janiaud

caveat that "the risk of further delay is rising".
The planes, which are more uel-efficient, were expected to elp Ryanair achieve cost savings - these will not now be 
achieved until 2021.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "We have already reduced our passenger growth expectation next year from 
7 to 3 per cent. We may have to cut that again."
Full-year losses for Ryanair's Lauda brand will exceed expectations, which Ryanair attributed to overcapacity in 
Austria and Germany.
Ryanair also envisages a (EURO)450m (£389m) rise in its fuel bill. The airline has narrowed its full-year guidance 
for post-tax profits accordingly to a new range of (EURO)800m-(EURO)900m.
Ryanair ( RYA )
The airline continues to be hamstrung by its Boeing order, and admits that growth in passenger traffic is vulnerable 
to market uncertainty. We see no significant catalysts for share price growth that would tempt us to upgrade our 
rating. Alex Janiaud

IAG cuts capacity growth targets for next three years Airlines ; Move comes as Walsh says he will leave BA 's 
owner before his 60th birthday
IAG cuts capacity growth targets for next three years; Airlines ; Move comes

British Airways' owner IAG will almost halve its planned expansion over the next three years, slowing the group's 
earnings growth in a period when chief executive Willie Walsh expects to step down.
Mr Walsh, at the helm of IAG since 2011, said yesterday that he planned to retire within the next two years.
"I still love what I do but my intention to be retired within the next two years ... I am going to keep my promise and 
retire before I'm 60," he told analysts at IAG's capital markets day in London.
Mr Walsh turns 60 on 25 October 2021. He added that the board has been working on succession planning.
Airline groups across the world have scaled back expansion plans for next year in a bid to prevent ticket prices from 
falling further on the back of weaker demand.
IAG, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, said that it now expected available seat kilometres - the 
industry measure of passenger capacity - to grow 3.4 per cent a year between 2020 and 2022, down from a 
previous forecast of 6 per cent growth a year for the 2019-23 period.
The cut in capacity led to IAG also lowering its forecast for growth in earnings per share to 10 per cent a year, 
compared with a previous estimate of 12 per cent a year.

owner before his 60th birthday
"There are no two ways about it, demand has softened," said Steve Gunis ning, chief financial officer at IAG. "This 
time around as we've been doing the business plan, it's been very much with a different context that says we need 
to be more cautious, see how to adapt the business in these softer environments."
Other airlines have also signalled plans to trim capacity. In October, easyJet said that it expected capacity growth in 
2020 to be at the lower end of its historic range, which is likely to see growth of about 3 per cent. This week Ryanair 
said that it may have to cut its passenger growth expectations again for next year amid delays to the delivery of 
Boeing 737 Max jets.
Last week, IAG reported a fall in profits on the back of the first pilots' strike in BA's history. In the three months to 
the end of September the airline group posted a 7 per cent fall in operating profit to (EURO)1.43bn after industrial 
action last month spiralled into one of the most serious disputes BA has faced.
However, as part of its strategy update to investors, IAG made no changes to the group's return on invested capital 
target of 15 per cent or to its operating profit margin of 12-15 per cent.
Mr Walsh said the group remained in a good position to take advantage of any opportunities in the market, 
reiterating that he believed more airlines would collapse amid the difficult conditions.
Shares in IAG declined less than 1 per cent yesterday.

Georgia The underground electronic music scene in Tbilisi has already led to some dubbing it "the new Berlin". Its 
graffiti-daubed warehouses converted into hipster hostels, visa-free travel for EU nationals since 2017 and last 
year's legalisation of marijuana have all helped Georgia hit record visitor numbers (8.7m last year). Access is 
getting easier too: Ryanair is launching three new routes to the country this month and a fourth next summer; Wizz 
Air is adding around 60,000 seats on routes to Kutaisi next year.
Faroe Islands No other destination has leveraged the viral power of social media as much as the tiny Faroes. A 
reorganisation and funding boost for the tourist board in 2012 was followed by a string of online campaigns 
including "sheep view", a cutesy alternative to Google Street View with cameras strapped to the back of sheep, and 
"Faroe Islands translate" in which islanders translate phrases via video message. In April, the islands were "closed 
for maintenance" for a weekend, with volunteers invited to come help with conservation projects. The result has 
been an increase in visitors (with tourist nights up 31 per cent between 2014 and 2018) - and a change in 
demographics. "Our visitors' age group has certainly fallen," says Súsanna Sørensen of Visit Faroe Islands.
Albania While Dubrovnik has become so overrun that it has unveiled plans to tax cruise ships, the beaches of 
Albania - less than a five-hour drive away - remain blissfully quiet. But perhaps not for long. The stigma around 
what was once the Balkans' most dangerous country is lifting and tourist numbers were up 20 per cent this year. 
Newcomer music festival Kala in the coastal town of Dhërmi is what Croatia felt like before the coast got choked 
with beach clubs. Festival goers should soon find it easier to get there, thanks to a new airport planned for nearby 
Vlorë.

Uzbekistan Offering the chance to rave on the dried-up Aral Sea in a graveyard of rusty ships, Sithia festival, which 
launched last year, is the Burning Man of Central Asia. It has helped attract a very different type of visitor - as has 
the relaxation of visa rules and improved infrastructure that makes independent travel much easier. Skyscanner 
report a 97 per cent increase in searches this year compared with last; Intrepid Travel, which claims to be the 
world's largest small group adventure company, says Uzbekistan sales have risen 257 per cent year on year. "It's 
the fastest-growing destination of 2019," says Aaron Hocking, Intrepid's commercial director.
Pakistan Could 2020 be Pakistan's year? A new e-visa scheme was launched in March and British Airways 
resumed flights to Islamabad in June. Meanwhile visits to the country's cultural sites rose more than threefold 
between 2014 and 2018. STA travel, the world's largest travel company for students and young people, reported a 
91 per cent increase in travellers this year compared with last, and adventure tour operator Wild Frontiers has 
recorded 40 per cent more bookings.

Aer Lingus owner IAG cuts medium-term capacity and profit forecasts
Aer Lingus owner IAG cuts medium-term capacity and profit forecasts

Aer Lingus owner IAG scaled back its forecast for capacity growth for the next three years on Friday, hitting its 
outlook for earnings per share but potentially providing relief for rivals in a weak global economy.
IAG said available seat kilometers, a measure of passenger-carrying capacity, was estimated to grow by 3.4% a 
year between 2020 and 2022, compared to a previous forecast of 6% growth a year for the 2019-2023 period.
The airline group, which also owns Iberia, British Airways and Vueling, said the capacity growth cut would lower its 
forecast for growth in earnings per share (EPS) to 10%+ a year from a previous forecast of 12%+ a year.
IAG shares were down 3% at 0821 GMT ahead of a strategy update from management at the company's capital 
markets day later on Friday.
The airline industry has struggled to maintain margins in the face of industry overcapacity and a muted economic 
outlook which has produced fierce competition over ticket prices.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh said last week that he expected global macroeconomic softness to continue in 2020. 
The company has also taken a hit from industrial action at British Airways, which has knocked its outlook for profits 
this year.
IAG said the forecasts for capacity growth numbers were not adjusted for the impact of the pilot strikes. After 48 
hours of action in September, no further industrial action is scheduled although the dispute over pay remains 
unresolved.
Aer Lingus owner IAG cuts medium-term capacity and profit forecasts
The issues at BA, which was forced to ground 1,700 flights during the walkout, was cited by easyJet as helping its 
performance in the last quarter, while Lufthansa has also said slower capacity growth at rivals was providing relief.
In a further sign of an easing of industry overcapacity, Ryanair is set to grow at its slowest rate in seven years in the 
year to March 31, 2021, as it expects further delays to its Boeing 737 MAX deliveries and may be without the jets 
next summer.
Friday's strategy update comes after IAG said on Monday it would buy Spain's Air Europa to boost its presence on 
routes to Latin America and the Caribbean.
IAG said it expected the deal, which will be funded through external debt, to close in the second half of next year 
and for it to add to its earnings in the first full year after the closure. (Reuters)

Lufthansa 's shares surge amid new cost-cutting drive
Lufthansa's shares surge amid new cost-cutting drive

Berlin/Vienna (dpa) - Germany's Lufthansa announced plans on Thursday to step up its cost-cutting drive, sending 
the airline group's shares surging on top of better-than-forecast quarterly profits.
With a cost-cutting programme already producing results at its European budget airline Eurowings, Lufthansa said 
that it was launching a new drive to boost profit at its Brussels Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo 
offshoots.
Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr said the group was "taking tangible corrective action to improve earnings" at its three 
subsidiaries.
Austrian Airlines said it was cutting its workforce by about 10 per cent in the face of stiff competition from low-cost 
carriers, notably Ireland-based Ryanair group and Hungary's Wizz Air. Both are also using Vienna as a hub.
The cuts are part of a new plan to slash annual costs at Austrian Airlines by 90 million euros (100 million dollars) a 
year, the airline's management said. Between 700 and 800 jobs are set to be cut by the end of 2021.
"We have to reposition ourselves to be able to survive the brutal competition against budget carriers," chief 
executive Alexis von Hoensbroech told a press conference in Vienna.
Austrian Airlines said its operating profit plummeted by 85 per cent to 17 million euros year-on-year in the first three 
quarters, also because of higher fuel prices.
Cologne-based Lufthansa said group third-quarter net profit climbed 4 per cent to 1.15 billion euros compared with 
the same period last year after sales rose 2 per cent to 10.18 billion euros.
Analysts had expected net profit to drop to 890 million euros in the three months to the end of the September.
Group revenue rose 2 per cent to 10.18 billion euros, Lufthansa said.
Lufthansa 's shares surge amid new cost-cutting drive
The latest Lufthansa results were released against the backdrop of a two-day strike by cabin crew over demands 
for higher expenses and allowances for the airline's flight attendants and contract improvements for seasonal 
workers.
Lufthansa said it was too early to assess the financial impact of the strike, which was expected to affect about 1,300 
flights and 180,000 passengers.
Lufthansa shares jumped 8.5 per cent to 17.54 euros in morning trading in Frankfurt following the airline's 
announcement of the new round of cost-cutting.
Group third-quarter operating profit, however, slumped 8 per cent to 1.3 billion euros, Lufthansa said.
Lufthansa said it was sticking to its planned group operating profit for this year of between 2.0 and 2.4 billion euros, 
despite what the group said was a "challenging operating environment."
Total revenues for 2019 are expected to rise by a single-digit percentage amount, while fuel costs are expected to 
be come in about 650 million euros above their 2018 levels, the company said.
Spohr said Eurowings "turnaround measures are showing the first results."
Rurowings emerged from its cost-cutting programme launched in June to post a 39-per-cent jump in third-quarter 
operating profit to 159 million euros.
Spohr also repeated on Thursday that Lufthansa would only be interested in investing in a restructured Alitalia. The 
Italian airline Alitalia was declared insolvent in May 2017.
Plans for Alitalia's recapitalization to be completed by November 21 were unrealistic, Spohr said. "Quality is more 
important than speed," he added.

Nov 07, 2019( ValueWalk: http://www.valuewalk.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Sven Carlin provides an analysis on 
the Boeing stock price. Boeing is a great business but Boeing stock might not be a great investment over the long-
term. Ryanair's CEO says how margins for Boeing earnings[1] will contract, Boeing stock price has been pushed up 
thanks to huge buybacks that have cost Boeing billions.

to your colleagues Q3 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] Trasncript Good day fellow investors. 
Over the last year and something each time Boeing stock falls, I get a few emails, I get a few comments. What do 
you think? And I really think I can add value to those who are interested in Boeing to see some factors that you 
might be missing when it comes to investing in Boeing. For those that are not interested in Boeing. I really think I 
can give you a few pointers a few lesson when it comes to investing here that you can really, really take advantage 
of in your investing life. So just three things on Boeing, I think it will really add value. So let's start immediately each 
time as I said, the stock price drops I get emails it dropped 10% Is it a bargain now? Is it the buy now and the first 
point I want to make just because a stock is down? It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean it's cheap, or it's a 
bargain[4] or it's an opportunity. If we just take a look at the Last year, and this the red are all the times that I get 
emails, question comments and whatever about bowling swing, what do you think? And what do you think? Is it the 
bargain is the bargain? Is it the goodbye now? And then if you look at this over the last year, Boeing didn't go 
anywhere. So that's the first thing.Boeing stock price and plane issuesAnd at the end stock prices, especially short 
term, stock price movements don't have any meaningful impact on your investment returns[5], you can trade 
bowing a little bit, but I would still say it's very, very risky. The key when it comes to investing, and this is point 
number two, our fundamentals and this is where most of you have it extremely right. Boeing is one of the two 
companies doing planes so it has a competitive advantage. It has a mode. It's very difficult to do to make planes as 
we have seen with Boeing issues over the last few years. So it's hard. However, there will be more people flying, 
there will be more people on earth. There will be economic development, economic growth, low cost carriers are 
growing everywhere long haul flights. So everything is very, very positive. The fundamentals of the business of 
Boeing are extremely positive. So you might see and I get that a lot of in the comments. It's a great business. Yes, it 
is no arguing about that. But because something is a great business, because something it is in a positive structural 
Boeing Stock Analysis - Margins, Buybacks And Boeing Stock Price
trend with the travelling tourism and more people positive tailwind, it doesn't yet mean it's a great investment. And 
that's something a lot of you especially those who send me those emails and comments if you wish ever to send me 
an email. I always love to read them because it gets me the and it gets me how the market feels. So feel free to 
shoot me an evil whenever you want vegetables. When it comes to those investments, just because something is a 
great business has a great position in the market, it doesn't mean it's immediately a great investment. And that's 
something we have to be very, very careful about.Boeing stock price: A fundamental lookWhat we have to look is 
fundamentals[6] also on the earning side, not just on the trend, the market, the opportunity side. And if I look at 
buying fundamentals, the gross margin has been always between 15 and 20, but mostly around 1516. And just in 
the last two years 2017 2018 it has been so close to 20 when Boeing had such a good margin and the operating 
margin was 10 and 11%, compared to the historical 7%. Boeing made great operating earnings that led to 
extremely high earnings per share. But this was just Two years in history, and I listened to Ryanair CEO in their 
conference call when I analysed Ryanair and the CEO said clearly that they are just buying Ryanair is just buying 
seven to nine year old planes because margins in the industry for new planes are a little bit on the high end of the 
historical average, which makes buying new planes not profitable. And they are waiting for those margins to return 
to the mean or below the mean to buy new planes because then it's economically viable to buy planes. Now when a 
CEO who is a smart guy like Ryanair says that margins are high, you know what to expect for from a company like 
Boeing. So when investing in fundamentals, you have to see okay, the trend is positive, as we said in the industry, 
but 
what 
is 
the 
average 
margins 
that 
I 
can 
expect?Twitter[7]

RYANAIR has grounded three planes due to cracks between the wing and fuselage, but has not disclosed it to the 
public, it was revealed yesterday.
Three of the airline's Boeing 737s have been affected by so-called pickle fork cracks, which have led to 50 planes 
being grounded since 3 October across the aviation industry.
Last week, the airline said it did not expect the issue would "have any impact upon our operations". However, an 
investigation from the Guardian revealed three Ryanair planes have been grounded due to pickle fork cracks.
Internal Ryanair logs from the three grounded planes - all of which are more than 15 years old - list them as having 
cracks.
A Ryanair spokesperson told the Guardian the "tiny number of findings" would not have any impact on its 
operations or our fleet availability.
The revelation comes after the US Federal Aviation Authority issued a directive for all Boeing 737 planes above 
30,000 flights to be inspected for pickle fork cracks within a week.
Airlines such as Qantas and Southwest were also affected, however they disclosed the problem.

Nov 07, 2019( Week Herald: https://weekherald.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) was 
upgraded by Zacks Investment Research[1] from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating in a research report issued on 
Thursday, Zacks.com[2] reports. The brokerage presently has a $89.00 target price on the transportation 
company's stock. Zacks Investment Research[3]'s price objective suggests a potential upside of 4.62% from the 
stock's current price. 
According to Zacks, "Shares of Ryanair have underperformed its industry in a year due to multiple headwinds such 
as labor unrest, Boeing 737 MAX groundings and high labor costs. Management stated while releasing second-
quarter fiscal 2020 results that the delivery of its first B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been delayed yet again and now it 
expects the jet delivery in March/April 2020. Moreover, weak airfares (down 5% in first-half fiscal 2020) are denting 
the company's profitability. High labor costs are also hurting Ryanair's bottom line. However, the increase in traffic 
bodes well for Ryanair. Notably, an 11% rise in traffic led to 11% growth in revenues in first-half fiscal 2020. 
Initiatives to add shareholder value are encouraging too. Efforts to widen its base are commendable as well. The 
buyout of Malta Air is in line with Ryanair 's plans to expand."Several other equities research analysts have also 
weighed in on RYAAY. ValuEngine[4] upgraded shares of Ryanair from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating in a report 
on Wednesday, October 2nd. Raymond James increased their target price on shares of Ryanair from $80.00 to 
$90.00 and gave the stock an "outperform" rating in a report on Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase .... lowered shares of 
Ryanair from a "neutral" rating to an "underweight" rating in a report on Monday, July 29th. Morgan Stanley 
assumed coverage on shares of Ryanair in a report on Wednesday, September 18th. They issued an "underweight" 
rating on the stock. Finally, Credit Suisse Group lowered shares of Ryanair from a "neutral" rating to an 
"underperform" rating in a report on Tuesday, July 23rd. Five equities research analysts have rated the stock with a 
sell rating, five have given a hold rating, four have issued a buy rating and one has issued a strong buy rating to the

Nov 07, 2019( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  A whistleblower claims that 
Boeings' 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen if the cabin were to suffer a sudden decompression. 
Emergency oxygen systems are supposed to keep passengers and crew alive if the cabin pressurisation fails. 
Without this system, passengers could be incapacitated, fall unconscious, or even sustain brain damage and/or die. 
John Barnett is a former quality control engineer who has worked for the company for 32 years, including in the 
South Carolina plant where the 787 Dreamliner is manufactured. 'Boeing South Carolina is strictly driven by 
schedule and cost,' Barnett claims, suggesting that up to a quarter of the oxygen systems could be faulty but were 
deliberately fitted to planes to save on costs. Barnett discovered the fault in 2015. He claims that under-pressure 
workers even fitted sub-standard parts from scrap bins to aircraft on the production line and- in one case - with the 
knowledge of a senior manager. Boeing denies the allegations of cost-saving at the expense of security. But 
Barnett is taking legal action against Boeing for denigrating his character and forcing him to retire. Boeing denies 
forcing Barnett to retire and argues that it has created a culture that encourages employees to raise concerns and 
rigorous processes to ensure they are listened to. Last week Boeing was forced to ground 50 of its popular 737NG 
planes due to cracks on the haul. Among the worst affected companies are Australia's Qantas and Ireland's 
Ryanair. The firm has also come under intense scrutiny following the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash in March. 
The view that Boeing prioritized cost-saving over security is echoed by former engineer Adam Dickson, who was 
involved with the development of the 737 Max at Boeing's Renton factory in Washington state. He told the BBC that 
his team had to fight the factory and management to maintain process and quality to standard.

Nov 06, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Multiple airlines 
around the world have grounded Boeing 737 Next Generation planes in recent weeks after the manufacturer 
announced a cracking problem in the planes' pickle forks. The pickle fork is the structure that connects the plane 
body, wing, and landing gear. Ryanair quietly grounded at least three 737NG planes, The Guardian reported[1], 
despite saying last week[2] that it doesn't expect the cracking issue to be a problem for its operations. Ryanair 
appeared to confirm that some planes had been grounded in a statement to Business Insider, saying that it had 
made a "tiny number (less than 5%) of findings" in its planes. 
Ryanair's profits have been affected by Boeing's ongoing crises, which include a worldwide grounding of its 737 
Max jets following two fatal crashes. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] Ryanair has become the 
latest airline to ground the Boeing 737 due to cracks found in the planes, The Guardian reported Wednesday[4]. 
The Irish budget airline grounded at least three Boeing 737 Next Generation (NG) planes due to fissures in the 
"pickle fork," the newspaper's Naaman Zhou reported, referring to a commonly used name for the structure that 
connects the plane body, wing, and landing gear. Multiple airlines have grounded Boeing 737NG planes in recent 
weeks, after Boeing announced the cracking problem in the 737NG, prompting the US Federal Aviation 
Administration to instruct airlines that fly the planes to inspect them[5].Ryanair had not disclosed the cracks or 
grounding until The Guardian published its story. The airline, which has more than 400 737NGs in service, told The 
Irish Times last week[6] that it was unlikely the cracking issue would impact operations or fleet availability. In a 
Wednesday statement to Business Insider, Ryanair appeared to confirm the grounding of three planes, but said it 
would not affect its operating fleet or flight schedules. "This tiny number (less than 5%) of findings would not affect 
either Ryanair's operating fleet or flights, because the airline has moved to its winter schedule from the end of 
October," the statement said, adding that Boeing is currently repairing planes for Ryanair. "Ryanair will continue to 
inspect the remainder of its fleet, in full compliance with the Airworthiness Directive, and we are confident that the 
tiny number of pickle fork cracks, if any, will not affect either Ryanair's fleet, its flights, or its schedules." The 
statement also called The Guardian's report "rubbish" and accused it of an "attempt to misreport the story," but did 
not say what details in the report the company disagrees with. Business Insider has requested clarification from 
Ryanair, but has not heard back from the airline at the time of publication.Up to 50 737NG planes around the world 
Ryanair quietly grounded Boeing 737 planes over 'pickle fork' cracking, becoming the latest airline to act on the 
problem
have been grounded so far, Agence France-Presse reported last week, with Qantas being the last airline to do so 
publicly[7]. Thousands of 737NG planes are in service globally. Experts previously said that the presence of a 
pickle fork crack "does not immediately compromise the safety of the aircraft," Australia's ABC News reported[8]. 
Boeing has not yet responded to Business Insider's request for comment on the cracking issue.Boeing currently 
faces crises on multiple fronts. Its 737 Max planes remain grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes by the 
aircraft within six months of each other, both of which are believed to have been caused by an internal software 
malfunction that employees had previously complained about. A former quality-control engineer has also told the 
BBC, in a report published Wednesday[9], that he found faulty emergency oxygen bottles on the 787 
Dreamliner,[10] but that the company stonewalled his request for further investigations. Ryanair has previously 
warned that its profits might get hammered by Boeing's troubles. In July, the airline said the grounding of the 737 
Max means it might carry fewer passengers and may even closer some of its airport bases[11]. Read more: Boeing

Nov 06, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
SkyWest SKYW[1] and the Latin American carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[2] reported better-than-
expected third-quarter 2019 earnings per share. However, the picture pertaining to revenues was in contrast for 
both carriers.SkyWest's revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined year over year due to the sale 
of ExpressJet Airlines in January 2019. Meanwhile, Gol Linhas' top line missed the consensus mark but improved 
year over year owing to solid demand in the corporate segment and capacity discipline.Meanwhile, profit after tax at 
the European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] was flat year over year at €1.15 billion in the first half of 
fiscal 2020 (ended Sep 30, 2019) with average air fares declining 5%. However, an 11% rise in traffic led to 11% 
growth in revenues during the first six months of fiscal 2020. Moreover, load factor was 96%. Over this period, the 
carrier returned €250 million to its shareholders through buybacks.On the non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines' 
DAL[4] October traffic report was impressive with the system-wide load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) 
increasing 10 basis points to 85.6% as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.(Read the last Airline Stock 
Roundup here[5]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. SkyWest's third-quarter 2019 earnings of $1.79 
per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73. Also, the bottom line improved 14% on a year-over-
year basis. 
Results benefited from the company's fleet transition initiatives. Additionally, quarterly revenues of $760.3 million

However, the company reported a loss in the year-ago period. This marks the company's 13th straight quarter of 
positive operating results. But, results were partly affected by 4% depreciation of the Brazilian real against the US 
dollar. Meanwhile, net revenues of $936 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $938.4 million. However, 
passenger revenues accounting for bulk (94.4%) of the top line improved 29.5% on a year-over-year basis. (Read

over-year basis.The carrier expects fiscal 2020 traffic to increase 8% to 153 million. Fuel bill and ex-fuel unit costs 
for the period are anticipated to rise €450m and 2%, respectively. The carrier expects fiscal 2020 profit after tax in 
the €800-€900 million range. Ryan air, however, is cautious about any market uncertainty like a 'no deal Brexit'. 
Even though the company has limited visibility in the fare environment for second-half fiscal 2020, the same is likely 
to be slightly better than what was witnessed last winter. Moreover, management stated that the delivery of its first 
B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been delayed yet again and now it expects the jet delivery in March/April 
2020.Meanwhile, Ryanair's October traffic report was excellent with the metric (including 0.6 million from its

At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) came in at 19.76 billion, up 5.2% year 
over year owing to 6.2% increase on the domestic front. Consolidated capacity (measured in available seat 
miles/ASMs) expanded 5.1% to 23.09 billion as well on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, Delta's passenger 
count rose 5.8% to 17.51 million in October.Meanwhile, on-time performance (mainline) was 86.6% in the month 
compared with 90% a year ago.5 International Consolidated Airlines Group ICAGY[9], the parent company of British 
Airways and Iberia, announced that it intends to acquire the Spanish airline Air Europa. Air Europa is currently

Ryanair says it will look to recover some of its lost growth in 2021

Ryanair expects further delay to its Boeing MAX 737 deliveries and may still be without the jets next summer, it said 
on Monday after half-year results that gave the Irish airline's shares a 7% uplift.
While investors appeared to focus on the better than expected profit and fares, Europe's largest budget carrier said 
it now expects to fly 157 million passengers in the year to March 31, 2021.
That represents only 2.6% growth from the current financial year, its slowest in seven years. And further delays on 
the jets could reduce that to zero growth at an airline that has increased passenger numbers by more than 10% on 
average since 2014.
However, finance chief Neil Sorahan said there is "no risk at all" that the airline would fail to meet its target of flying 
200 million passengers a year by March 2024.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the grounded MAX 737, with 210 on order, and said in July that it 
expected to be flying 30 of the planes next summer after taking its first delivery in January.
CEO Michael O'Leary on Monday said the company had lowered its estimate to 20 planes by next summer with "a 
real risk of none."
"The risk of further delay is rising," he said in a post-results video presentation, adding that he does not expect 
Boeing to achieve its target of getting the plane back in service in the United States by Christmas.
U.S. carriers do not expect to fly the MAX until 2020, schedules show, as they wait for regulators to end the 
worldwide grounding that followed two deadly crashes.
Ryanair says it will look to recover some of its lost growth in 2021
Ryanair faces longer delays because it has to wait for approval by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency 
(EASA) and specific certification for Ryanair's MAX200 model, each of which are likely to cause several weeks of 
delay.
The airline reported post-tax profit of 1.15 billion euros for the six months to Sept. 30, its most profitable part of the 
year, beating a concensus forecast of 1.08 billion euros in a company supplied poll of analysts.
Falls in average fares were less than feared and revenue for optional extras surged 28% after the introduction of a 
charge to bring a 10kg piece of hand luggage on flights.
It now expects full-year profit of between 800 million and 900 million euros, versus a previous forecast of 750-950 
million euros and a consensus analyst estimate of 836 million euros.
That would represent a continued decline from last financial year's 1.02 billion euro profit, which was down from 
1.45 billion euros the year before that.
Ryanair said it expects modest growth in average fares this winter, with strong sales of optional extras to raise full-
year revenue per passenger by 2-3%.
It also warned of higher than expected losses at its Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion because of overcapacity in 
Austria and Germany.
"Q2 was ahead of consensus, with average fares not as bad as feared," Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a 
note, adding that the balance of risks to next year "is modestly on the downside given further MAX delivery delays."

THE FTSE 100 surged nearly one per cent to a more than one-month high yesterday as heavyweight banks, miners 
and oil stocks were driven higher by hopes of a trade deal between the United States and China. The FTSE 100 
added 0.9 per cent, its best day in almost two weeks, boosted by BP and Shell as well as Asia-focused HSBC and 
Prudential.
Miners jumped almost three per cent to their highest since mid-September.
The blue-chip index joined a global stocks rally triggered by signals from Washington and Beijing that they had 
made progress towards resolving a nearly 16-month-long trade war that has roiled the global economy.
Updates on US-Sino trade talks have been a major source of volatility for the FTSE 100 this year. They helped the 
index hit a more than nine-month high in July, but then drove its sharpest fall in 10 months in August when tensions 
escalated.
The FTSE 250 advanced 0.5 per cent yesterday, though gains were limited by steep drops in gambling firms after a 
cross-party group of UK politicians called for measures to overhaul online casinos.
Shares of GVC, William Hill and 888 shed between 10.5 per cent and 13.7 per cent, enduring their worst day in 
months.
Among notable gainers were London-listed shares of Ryanair, which jumped 8.2 per cent for their best day since 
December 2014, after the Irish airline's first half profit beat analysts'consensus forecast. Mid-cap budget airlines 
Easyjet and Wizz Air rose 3.8 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. Baby products retailer Mothercare, which has 
shut a third of its British stores in the past year and lost nearly half its share value this year, sank another 26 per 
cent after saying it intended to appoint administrators for its UK operations.

International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Iberia, has agreed to buy Air Europa for (EURO)1bn, as it 
seeks to open up the South American transatlantic market and turn Madrid into a hub airport.
The deal drew immediate fire from Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive. "I think it's a good deal for IAG, for 
[chief executive] Willie Walsh. I think it's a bad deal from a competition point of view," he said.
IAG said yesterday it had agreed a cash deal for the Spanish airline, which offers domestic and international flights 
to 69 destinations, including long-haul routes to the Americas. The UK-based group is betting that the deal will 
establish Madrid as one of Europe's premier airports, rivalling Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London Heathrow and Paris. It 
will open new routes for IAG, giving the carrier a 26 per cent share in the Europe to Latin America market, up from 
19 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would be looking for competition authorities to impose some "competition divestments" 
before approving the deal "but otherwise we would certainly be supportive of that type of consolidation". IAG was 
thwarted this year in an attempt to spread its wings into South America when the Chilean Supreme Court struck 
down a proposed joint venture with American Airlines and Chilebased Latam. "IAG needed an avenue to 
strengthening Latin America after the Latam joint venture ran into problems," analysts at Bernstein said.

International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Iberia, has agreed to buy Air Europa for (EURO)1bn, as it 
seeks to open up the South American transatlantic market and turn Madrid into a hub airport.
The deal drew immediate fire from Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive. "I think it's a good deal for IAG, for 
[chief executive] Willie Walsh. I think it's a bad deal from a competition point of view," he said.
IAG said yesterday it had agreed a cash deal for the Spanish airline, which offers domestic and international flights 
to 69 destinations, including long-haul routes to the Americas. The UK-based group is betting that the deal will 
establish Madrid as one of Europe's premier airports, rivalling Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London Heathrow and Paris. It 
will open new routes for IAG, giving the carrier a 26 per cent share in the Europe to Latin America market, up from 
19 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would be looking for competition authorities to impose some "competition divestments" 
before approving the deal "but otherwise we would certainly be supportive of that type of consolidation". IAG was 
thwarted this year in an attempt to spread its wings into South America when the Chilean Supreme Court struck 
down a proposed joint venture with American Airlines and Chilebased Latam. "IAG needed an avenue to 
strengthening Latin America after the Latam joint venture ran into problems," analysts at Bernstein said.

Delivery problems Ryanair warns of 737 Max delays
Delivery problems Ryanair warns of 737 Max delays

Ryanair has said the risk of more delays to the delivery of new Boeing 737 Max jets is rising, warning that it might 
not receive any of the new aircraft it hopes to deploy before the peak summer season next year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said more delays in the delivery of the new aircraft, billed as a cost-cutting 
"gamechanger" for its fuel efficiency but which were grounded after two fatal crashes, could hit passenger traffic 
next year.
"We have already reduced our passenger growth expectation next year from 7 to 3 per cent; we expect to grow 
from about 153m to 157m passengers. We may have to cut that again," he said.
Mr O'Leary was speaking as Ryanair said the outlook for the remainder of its current fiscal year was "cautious" after 
lower fares and higher fuel costs left profits unchanged in the first half.
However, investors brushed off those concerns to send shares in Ryanair up nearly 8 per cent.
Ryanair said it expected ancillary revenues to grow ahead of traffic growth in the full year. An 11 per cent rise in 
revenues to (EURO)5.39bn in the first half included a 28 per cent increase in sales of ancillaries, everything bar the 
ticket, to (EURO)1.65bn.
Overall, pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of September was flat at (EURO)1.26bn, a trading period that 
includes the peak summer season.
Delivery problems Ryanair warns of 737 Max delays
The carrier was originally scheduled to take delivery of almost 60 planes by next summer but warned in July it 
expected only 30. Mr O'Leary now expects to receive 20 at best, but possibly none, after he cautioned that the 737 
Max was unlikely to return to service in the US until after Christmas.
"There is a risk that those aircraft deliveries might run later into next year," he said.
The airline said it expected "modest increases in fares over the winter" as it narrowed full-year after-tax profit 
guidance from (EURO)750m to (EURO)950m to a new range of (EURO)800m to (EURO)900m. Arthur Beesley,

RYANAIR expects further delay to its Boeing 737 Max deliveries and may still be without the jets next summer, it 
said yesterday after half-year results that gave the Irish airline's shares a 7.75 per cent uplift.
While investors appeared to focus on the better than expected profit and fares, Europe's largest budget carrier said 
it now expects to fly 157m passengers in the year to 31 March 2021.
Ryanair reported a flat year-on-year profit of (EURO)1.15bn (£993m) to the end of September as traffic rose 11 per 
cent to 86m passengers.

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday that McDonald's had gone too far in firing its boss over a 
consensual relationship with an employee.
"I really get very worried when companies start having policies on people's private activity," O'Leary said in an 
interview with Sky News, when asked about McDonald's decision to dismiss Watfordborn chief Steve Easterbrook. 
"The organisation that has the most trouble imposing morality on everybody is the Catholic Church," the Irishman 
added. "They've had celibacy for 2,000 years and never been able to manage it."
It came as McDonald's made public the details of Easterbrook's termination agreement, after his dismissal on 
Sunday.
The ousted boss will be eligible for six months of severance pay and 18 months of health benefits. Bloomberg 
reported he would also keep up to £40m in a mixture of pay and stock awards.
McDonald's added yesterday that its global chief people officer David Fairhurst would also be leaving the firm.

BRITISH Airways' parent company, IAG, has reached a (EURO)1bn (£863m) deal to acquire rival Air Europa in a 
bid to bolster its presence in the South Atlantic.
The deal means IAG can turn its Madrid hub into "a true rival" to the four European hubs of Amsterdam, Frankfurt, 
Heathrow and Paris Charles De Gaulle airports, the company said.
"Acquiring Air Europa would add a new competitive, cost effective airline to IAG, consolidating Madrid as a leading 
European hub and resulting in IAG achieving South Atlantic leadership," IAG boss Willie Walsh said. "IAG has a 
strong track record of successful acquisitions, most recently with the acquisition of Aer Lingus in 2015 and we are 
convinced Air Europa presents a strong strategic fit for the group."
Air Europa, one of Spain's biggest private airlines, flies to Europe, South America, the US, the Caribbean and 
northern Africa.
It generated an operating profit of (EURO)100m in 2018 on revenue of (EURO)2.1bn carrying 11.8m passengers.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said yesterday he would ask the UK's Competition and Markets Authority to 
intervene in the deal.
IAG shares rose one per cent to 547.80p yesterday.

Nov 04, 2019( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex)  About 180,000 Romanians are affected 
every year by flight cancellations or delays. 
The amount of money they lose annually from the compensation rights for canceled of delayed flights they do not 
request exceeds 35 million euros, according to FlightClaim.ro. 'Every day, 5-6 flights are canceled or delayed in 
Romania daily, which means that about 500 Romanians are affected. Over 1,000 flights with such problems were 
recorded in the last 9 months on Romanian airports. The total value of compensations they are entitled to annually 
exceeds 35-40 million euros,' the press release shows. 'Scared by bureaucracy or difficult procedures, only 10% of 
Romanians faced with flights with problems claim their rights from air companies, while the rest of 90% give up 
requesting compensations of 250, 400 or 600 euros, according to the length of the flight,'FlightClaim.ro 
representatives say, a company registering between 20 and 50 compensation claims from Romanian passengers 
who want to receive their rights from air companies. Since the beginning of the year to the present day, most 
canceled flights were in January, when Romanian airports recorded over 180 flights with at least 3 hour delays or 
were canceled, and in August when 170 flights were delayed or canceled, especially low cost or charter flights. 
Some delayed line flights also led to connection losses and many passengers flying to exotic destinations started 
claiming compensations of 600 euros/person. Most delayed and canceled flights were recorded by Tarom and by 
low cost companies Wizz Air, Ryanair and Blue Air, FlightClaim.ro shows. Destinations with most delays were 
Milan, Madrid, Rome, Larnaca and London.

Nov 05, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - November 5, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. 
Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Sony Corp. SNE[1], Allstate Corp. 
ALL[2] and Incyte Corp. INCY[3].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: Earnings Season Clean-Up: 
Global Week AheadI see a little bit of earnings season clean-up to accomplish in the Global Week Ahead.In the 
U.S., Zacks has 1290 total companies (both large ...all) reporting this week.For the S...00 companies, Disney 
earningswill be a highlight. The company reports its latest results on Thursday, after the market closes: According 
to Zacks, based on 4 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for Q3 is $0.97Investors see a tough quarter 
for its media networks division, with financial pain delivered via its acquisition ofFox assetsInvestors also await 
updates on the eagerly anticipated Disney+ OTT streaming service. They seek to challenge streaming giant Netflix 
and go up against Amazon Prime and Apple's newly launched TV+ service Retailers Under Armour, Tapestry, Coty, 
Ralph Lauren and Capri Holdings also report Q3 earnings, along with Qualcomm, Booking Holdings and 
TripAdvisor.Across the Pond, Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury, Associated British Foods and Ryanair report in 
London.To Friday, November 1st, Zacks Research Director Sheraz Mian says 357 of S...00 members (71%) have 
reported Q3 results: Total S...00 earnings were down -1.9%Total S...00 revenues were up +3.6% Note: At Zacks, 
'total earnings' mean 'aggregate net income' for those 357 S...00 members — not mean, median or market-cap 
weighted EPS.We prefer to look at net income as a measure of earnings, not EPS. This removes distorting effects 
from share buybacks on EPS-based growth rates.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity 
traders.(1) U.S. and European Earnings Seasons Show Negative Earnings Results OverallIt's a close call, but for 
the S...00, third 2019 quarter could bring the first quarterly year-over-year earnings decline since 2016.Despite juicy 
beats from heavyweights Apple and Facebook, earnings are expected to have declined -0.8%, according to IBES 
Refinitiv. That's better than earlier forecasts a month ago: a -2.2% decline was predicted.Remember also that Q1 
and Q2 estimates started negative, yet ended positive. So upcoming reports by names such Occidental Petroleum, 
CVS Health, Qualcomm and Walt Disney Co. may well move the needle across the line.No such hope for Europe. 
The STOXX index is seeing the worst quarterly earnings in more than three years, Refinitiv says. It expects Q3 
earnings to drop -8.4%, the biggest quarterly fall since mid-2016.Also, of European companies to report so far, 
59.3% exceeded analyst estimates. The U.S. figure is 75%.(2) Tough to Find U.S. China Trade OptimismAny 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Sony , Allstate and Incyte
optimism that China and the United States will settle their trade differences this month has been doused.And not 
merely because Chile called off the Nov 16-17 Asia-Pacific summit where the first phase of the bilateral Sino-U.S. 
trade deal was to be signed. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stepped up verbal attacks on China, and 
Beijing is expressing doubts that long-standing issues with Washington can be resolved.With the trade war now 
almost two years old, upcoming data from China, Malaysia and Taiwan should underscore the deterioration in 
global demand. Surveys showing Chinese exports in a slump haven't left much hope for positive 
surprise.Meanwhile, the Communist Party's 4-day plenum has wrapped up, with little visibility on what the plans are 
to tackle the effects of the trade war, food inflation and pro-democracy tensions in Hong Kong.(3) Will the BoE Cut 
Rates on Thursday, or Not?Rate cut or rate rise — that's the question Bank of England-watchers have been 
puzzling over.Bank policymakers have sometimes argued for an interest rate cut to offset Brexit-linked economic 
weakness, and at other times warned a rate rise might be required as currency weakness risks sparking 
inflation.On Thursday, though, the biggest change at the BoE meeting could be the rebranding of the 20-year-old 
Inflation Report as the Monetary Policy Report. That will focus it on forecasts and ad-hoc analysis rather than 
merely reviewing the previous quarter.Policy rates should stay at 0.75%, with little chance that dovish commentary 
from policymakers Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe will translate into a rate cut vote.But the BoE has been 
edging away from long-term guidance that rates are on an upward path, noting in September that this hinged on 
Brexit and the global economy picking up. Saunders has said since then the BoE cannot wait indefinitely for Brexit 
uncertainty to lift, and that economic slowdown strengthens the case for easing policy.For now, policymakers 
appear happy to sit on their hands, given the Dec. 12 snap election and a new Jan. 31 Brexit deadline. Also, the 
government is promising a spending boost that the BoE estimates will add +0.4% to GDP in the next couple of 
years.On the other hand, if the opposition wins power, Brexit may be delayed or even revoked, reducing the need to 
cut.Some policymakers doubt a rate cut would do much good anyway. Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden fears the 
slowdown is damaging the economy's productive capacity so lower interest rates are more likely to boost inflation 
than lift growth. Brexit and the election will keep the Bank of England playing a waiting game.(4) Is Three Decades 
of Globalization All That We See?Nov. 9 marks 30 years since the Berlin Wall fell - an event many see as the 
starting gun for the latest wave of globalization.It's been three decades of trade and political liberalization and a 
golden age for financial globalization. It was a period when unfettered cross-border investment and booming trade 
pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, MSCI's global equity index almost quadrupled in value and 
world growth rose from the 1990s average of +3.1% to almost +4.0% by 2009.But the globalization wave may have 
crested.The market booms of the late 1990s and 2000s, and the crazy banking excesses they spawned, culminated 
in the 2008 crash — the effects of which still linger. Rising inequality has led to electoral backlashes, bringing us 
Trump and his trade wars, Brexit and a host of populist, illiberal political movements and 'strongmen' — all keen on 
nationalism rather than cross-border cooperation.If that heady 30-year period is indeed ending, should world 
markets be running scared? It's an $80 trillion global GDP question. Is the much-vaunted peace dividend talked 
about in 1990 about to be whipped away? Elections in the United States, Britain and elsewhere may well dictate the 
path from here.(5) South Africa Barely Keeps Investment Grade Credit RatingSouth Africa is going through a 
momentous time — its rugby team put on a scintillating display to win the World Cup for the first time since 2007, 
and its government has escaped losing the investment grade credit rating it has held for almost 20 years.That rating 
has afforded South Africa abundant foreign investment and low borrowing costs. But its membership of that club 
would have ended on Friday if Moody's had decided to join the other two big rating agencies in consigning the 
government's Baa3 rating to 'junk.'An immediate downgrade was possible but unlikely, despite Finance Minister 
Tito Mboweni's recent budget bombshell forecasting a big budget deficit and ballooning debt. Moody's did still opt 
for a negative assessment, but rather put South Africa on CreditWatch negative, a stance that portends a 
downgrade within 90 days, it merely cut the outlook to Negative.Losing investment grade would have raised 
borrowing costs and led to South Africa's ejection from the elite World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Goldman 
Sachs estimates this would trigger around $15 billion in investment outflows.But the outlook downgrade gives South 
Africa up to 18 months to put its house in order. That — and of course a rugby win — were probably what Mboweni 
is hoping for before the weekend and so far his prayers have been answered.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY)

BEIJING (AP) - Global stock markets rose Monday on hopes for progress in trade talks between the United States 
and China and on the back of strong economic data.
London and Frankfurt opened higher while Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul also rose. Japanese markets were 
closed for a holiday.
Market sentiment was lifted by Friday's U.S. jobs report, which was better than expected. That helped to dilute 
disappointment over a key manufacturing survey for the U.S., which fell for a third month.
The U.S. data were "the icing on the cake" after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and the U.S. and Chinese 
governments issued "encouraging statements" about their tariff battle, said Craig Erlam of Oanda in a report.
"Of course, we've had plenty of warm words before that have delivered very little but things seem to finally be 
moving," said Erlam.
In early trading, London's FTSE 100 rose 1.1% to 7,384 and Germany's DAX advanced 1.2% to 13,118. France's 
CAC 40 added 1.1% to 5,825.
On Wall Street, futures for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 
0.5%. On Friday, the S&P 500 hit an all-time high for the third time in a week.
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6% to 2,975.49 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.6% to 
27,547.30. Seoul's Kospi added 1.4% to 2,130.24. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,686.90 and India's 
Sensex rose 0.3% to 40,286.44.
Friday's employment numbers helped to shore up investor faith that has been shaken by U.S.-China trade tension 
and Brexit.
The world's largest economies have agreed to a truce in what President Donald Trump dubbed "phase one" of a 
trade deal. Envoys are negotiating the details, but economists caution major issues have yet to be decided.
Global markets rise amid hopes for trade talks, earnings
Corporate earnings, meanwhile, have been slightly better than expected. Among the companies reporting on 
Monday are Uber. In London, shares in Ryanair were up almost 8% after it posted upbeat quarterly figures.
Shares in Under Armour Inc. were down a sharp 16% in premarket trading after the clothes maker said it is being 
investigated by federal authorities over its accounting practices. Shares in McDonald's were down 2.7% after its 
CEO was forced out over a workplace relationship.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 75 cents to $56.95 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. The contract jumped $2.22 on Friday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 92 
cents to $61.61 per barrel in London. It surged $2.07 the previous session.
CURRENCY: The dollar rose to 108.42 from Friday's 108.18. The euro edged down to $1.1166 from $1.1168.

Ryanair Tightens Full-Year Forecast After Higher Sales Fail to Boost Earnings in Fiscal First Half

 Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L), Europe's largest budget airline, narrowed its forecast for full-year profit after tax and also 
set out plans "cut or close" loss-making bases this winter after higher first-half sales failed to lift earnings.
While sales jumped by 11% to 5.39 billion euros ($6.02 billion) during the six months that ended Sept. 30 due in 
part to a surge in ancillary revenue and passenger traffic, group turnover per guest rose by 1%, the Dublin, Ireland-
based carrier said in its earnings statement.
The load factor, which measures capacity utilization, was flat at 96% from a year ago, contributing to profit after tax 
also remaining unchanged at 1.15 billion euros in the fiscal first half.
The airline, whose fuel costs soared by 22% in the first half, said it was 90% hedged for 2020 at $71 per barrel and 
63% in the following year at $61 per barrel. Ex-fuel unit costs rose by 2% because of factors such as higher pilot 
pay and maintenance. The group, which continues to operate older aircraft given the delay in the delivery of 
Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX aircraft, said the new aircraft were 16% more fuel-efficient.
"Due to the MAX delivery delays, we will be forced to cut or close a number of loss-making bases this winter 
leading to pilot and cabin crew job losses," the company said in the statement.
Ryanair, which sees a further delay to MAX deliveries expected in March/April, painted a "cautious" outlook for the 
rest of fiscal 2020. It narrowed full-year guidance for profit after tax to 800 million euros to 900 million euros, from 
750 million euros to 950 million euros, as set out in its first-quarter earnings report.
"This guidance is heavily dependent on H2 [second-half] fares, Brexit [now rescheduled to after general elections 
on Dec. 12 in the UK], and the absence of any security events," the company said in the statement.

Aer Lingus parent IAG ups bet on Latin America with Air Europa takeover
Aer Lingus parent IAG ups bet on Latin America with Air Europa takeover

IAG, the parent of Aer Lingus and British Airways, announced a 1 billion euro takeover of Spain's Air Europa to 
boost its presence on routes to Latin America and the Caribbean.
The deal follows a setback in Latin America for IAG after Chile's Supreme Court ruled against a plan that would 
have allowed it to bolster cooperation with partners in the oneworld airlines alliance.
Chile's LATAM Airlines in September then announced it planned to leave the alliance, opting instead for a tie-up 
with SkyTeam member Delta Air Lines.
IAG shares initially rose more than 2% following the Air Europa takeover announcement but some analysts said 
IAG may have to shed routes in order to win regulatory approval.
IAG shares were up 1.2% at 1315 GMT.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said his company will ask the UK's market watchdog to force IAG to make 
divestments as part of its Air Europa takeover, a deal he said would be bad for competition.
"Potential remedies, perhaps in the form of slot release or behavioral restrictions, may be required and these could 
impact the potential synergies," an analyst at Liberum wrote in a note.
IAG also owns carriers Iberia Express, Level, Ireland's Aer Lingus and Vueling.
"We are not convinced that having just another brand platform is the optimal move, and could see it potentially 
combining with Level, Vueling or potentially Iberia Express after some time," analysts at Bernstein said.

Air Europa serves 69 destinations, including long-haul routes to the Americas and the Caribbean. It had a fleet of 66 
aircraft at the end of 2018.
Air Europa's Spanish parent company Globalia earlier this year received authorisation from the Brazilian 
government to explore the possibility of flying domestic routes within Latin America’s largest economy.
It is unclear if that authorisation will remain with Globalia or be transferred to IAG.
Air Europa will initially keep its brand and as it gets integrated into the existing hub at Madrid it will be a standalone 
operation run by Iberia boss Luis Gallego, IAG said.
It will also withdraw Air Europa from the SkyTeam alliance once the deal is completed. Air Europa has a joint 
venture with Air France-KLM.
"This is of strategic importance for the Madrid hub, which in recent years has lagged behind other European hubs," 
said Gallego, adding that Madrid had the potential to serve as a gateway between Asia and Latin America.
IAG said it expected the Air Europa deal, which will be funded through external debt, to close in the second half of 
next year and for it to add to its earnings in the first full year after the closure. (Reuters)

Nov 04, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-frills 
airline Ryanair said Monday that first-half net profit flattened on lower ticket prices, weak British demand, fierce 
competition elsewhere in Europe and a soaring fuel bill.The Dublin-based carrier, famed for promoting knock-down 
ticket prices, said in a results statement that profit after taxation was unchanged at 1.15 billion euros ($1.28 billion) 
in the six months to September from a year earlier.Average air fares fell five percent "due to the weaker consumer 
demand in the UK and overcapacity in Germany and Austria," it added.Revenues nevertheless rose 11 percent to 
5.39 billion euros, but jet fuel costs surged 22 percent to 1.59 billion euros while staff costs also grew. Ryanair also 
issued cautious guidance for the full-year, with the outlook clouded by Britain's looming departure from the 
European Union at the end of January.

expect a slightly better fare environment than last winter, although we have limited visibility," the airline added."This 
however remains sensitive to any market uncertainty such as a no-deal Brexit."The airline also tightened its annual 
profit forecast to between 800 and 900 million euros.That compared with prior guidance of between 750 and 950 
million euros."This guidance is heavily dependent on... fares, Brexit and the absence of any security events," it 
noted.Ryanair's four divisions comprise its main Irish operations, Austrian-based Lauda, Polish unit Buzz, and Malta 
Air.

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported that its profit attributable to equity holders of parent for the half-
year ended September 30, 2019 was 1.153 billion euros or 1.0204 euros per share, compared to 1.151 billion euros 
or 0.9892 euros per share in the prior year. 
 Revenue grew 11% to 5.39 billion euros from last year. Scheduled Sales rose 5% to 3.74 billion euros as it carried 
86 million guests at 5% lower air fares due to the weak consumer demand in the UK and overcapacity in Germany 
and Austria.
 Ancillary Revenue jumped 28% to 1.65 billion euros as more guests chose Priority Boarding and Preferred Seat 
services.
 Delivery of the Group's first B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been repeatedly delayed from the second-quarter 2019. 
Revenue now expects its first MAX aircraft to deliver in March/April 2020 at the earliest. The risk of further delay is 
rising. 
 Ryanair expects to receive only 20 MAX-200s (previously 58) in time for S.20 which has cut its S.20 growth rate 
from 7% to 3%.
 The company said its outlook for the remainder of the year remains cautious. Full year traffic will grow 8% to 153 
million but it expects a slightly better fare environment than last winter, although it has limited the second-half 
visibility.
 The company narrowed its full year profit after tax guidance to a range of 800 million euros to 900 million euros. 
Previously, the company said it continued to guide broadly flat fiscal year 2020 profit after tax in a range of 750 
million euros to 950 million euros.

       European stocks rose showed a strong move to the upside during trading on Monday amid renewed optimism 
over U.S.-China trade talks. 
 While the German DAX Index surged up by 1.4 percent, the French CAC 40 Index jumped by 1.1 percent and the 
U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index advanced by 0.9 percent.
 Tariff-exposed automakers and commodity-related mining stocks led the surge after U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Wilbur Ross expressed optimism phase one of a trade deal could be signed this month.
 "We're in good shape, we're making good progress, and there's no natural reason why it couldn't be," Ross said in 
an interview with Bloomberg on Sunday.
 Ross called the phase one agreement "particularly complicated" and acknowledged it is "always possible" the 
signing of the deal could "slip a little bit."
 In the interview, Ross also said licenses for U.S. firms to sell components to China's Huawei Technologies would 
be coming "very shortly."
 The comments from Ross came after a report from China's Xinhua News Agency last Friday said U.S. and 
Chinese trade negotiators have "reached consensus on principles."
 In economic news, a measure of Eurozone manufacturing was finalized at 45.9 in October, up from September's 
seven-year low reading of 45.7.
 German medical-equipment maker Siemens Healthineers spiked 9.5 percent after reporting a rise in net profit and 
revenue during the fourth quarter of the year. 
European Markets Close Notably Higher On Trade Deal Optimism
 Lender Deutsche Bank jumped by 3.7 percent after appointing Claudio de Sanctis as Global Head of Deutsche 
Bank Wealth Management, succeeding Fabrizio Campelli who joins the group Management Board as Chief 
Transformation Officer.
 Budget airline Ryanair Holdings soared 8.2 percent as it reported higher second quarter earnings despite rising fuel 
and staff costs. 
 Saint-Gobain also advanced by 2 percent. The company said that its French subsidiary Placoplatre has reached an 
agreement with HIRSCH Servo Group and BEWiSynbra Group to sell its expanded polystyrene business in France.
 On the other hand, struggling baby goods retailer Mothercare plunged 25.8 percent after saying it is planning to call 
in administrators to the troubled firm's U.K. business.

Budget carrier Ryanair is expecting a slight improvement to the fare situation over the second half, while other 
contributing elements have led the airline to narrow its full-year net profit forecast to 800-900 million ($890 million to 
$1 billion).
It had previously put the outlook in the 750-950 million range, down from its 2018-19 full year profit of just over 1 
billion.
Ryanair has turned in flat half-year net profits of $1.15 billion and it remains "cautious" of the second half.
"We try to avoid the unreliable optimism of some competitors," it states.
Fares over the first half were 5% lower, which Ryanair attributes to weak UK demand and overcapacity in Austria 
and Germany.
Although it predicts full-year passenger numbers will rise by 8% to 153 million, with a "slightly better" fare 
environment than the previous winter, the situation "remains sensitive".
Ryanair expects its fuel expenditure to rise by 450 million while unit costs, outside of fuel, will increase by 2%.
It also estimates that losses from its Austrian operation Lauda will be "higher than originally expected" owing to the 
overcapacity in the region.
Lauda's pricing in Austria and Germany remains "difficult", says Ryanair, and its revenue-per-passenger figures are 
still behind targets.

The airline is aiming to take advantage of the collapse of Thomas Cook Group and Adria Airways to recruit Airbus 
A320 crews and expand its fleet of 23 A320s to 38 for summer 2020. Ryanair says the carrier will benefit from "low 
cost" leases of A320s.
Lauda will remain loss-making in the current fiscal year 2019-20, adds Ryanair, but strong traffic growth and lower 
costs will "push it towards break-even" for 2020-21.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair says it has dampened expectations that it would receive the entirety of its planned delivery 
of Boeing 737 Max airplanes next year.
As the Ireland-headquartered reported profit of 1.15 billion euros ($1.28 billion) for the half-year to September, in 
line with the same period of 2018, CEO Michael O'Leary said the airline now expects to receive its first Max planes 
in March 2020.
O'Leary said Monday that "we have reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft being delivered to us in advance of 
peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none."
Europe's busiest airline has said it would cut flights and close some bases because of delays to deliveries of the 
plane, which has been grounded globally after two fatal crashes.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said Monday it expected to receive "only 20" Boeing (BA) 737 MAX-200s in time for its 
fiscal second half compared with 58 previously estimated, forcing Europe's biggest budget carrier to cut its H2 
growth rate to 3% from 7%.
The airline, which expects to receive the delivery of its first MAX aircraft in March/April 2020 at the earliest, now 
anticipates 157 million in passenger traffic in fiscal 2021, versus a previous estimate of 162 million. The delivery is 
also subject to approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency.
"Delivery of the first 737-MAX-200 aircraft has been repeatedly delayed from Q2, 2019," Ryanair said in its first-half 
earnings statement. "The risk of further delay is rising."
The company, however, said the "gamechanger" aircraft that burns 16% less fuel while offering 4% more seats will 
"transform our cost base and our business for the next decade."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) reported on Monday a jump in sales in the first half of its fiscal year while disclosing 
plans to "cut or close" loss-making bases this winter. Shares jumped 8% intraday.
Sales jumped by 11% EUR to 5.39 billion ($6.02 billion) during the six months that ended Sept. 30 due in part to a 
surge in ancillary revenue and passenger traffic, according to an earnings statement. Profit after tax was flat at 
EUR1.15 billion as fuel costs soared by 22%.
The carrier sees a risk of a further delay to Boeing (BA) 737 MAX deliveries now expected in March/April.
"Due to the [Boeing 737] MAX delivery delays, we will be forced to cut or close a number of loss-making bases this 
winter leading to pilot and cabin crew job losses," the company said.
The group narrowed its full-year guidance for profit after tax to EUR800 million to EUR900 million, from EUR750 
million to EUR950 million, as set out in its first-quarter earnings report.

Ryanair has cut back further its Boeing 737 Max fleet forecast, expecting only 20 aircraft to arrive in time for the 
2020 summer season.
The airline originally planned to have 58 of the type in service ahead of the summer peak, but had already been 
forced to halve this to 30 following the Max's worldwide grounding.
Ryanair is revising this forecast again, as a result of the continuing delay to the aircraft's return to service, pushing 
back the expected delivery date of its first 737 Max to March-April.
"The risk of further delay is rising," the airline says, pointing out that it has cut its summer 2020 growth outlook from 
7% to 3% and trimmed its 2020-21 passenger number forecast from 162 million to 157 million.
Postponement of the Max deliveries means Ryanair will not benefit from the type's cost savings until the 2020-21 
fiscal year.
It states that it has "frozen" pre-delivery payments and that discussions with the US airframer are "ongoing".
Ryanair is blaming the delay for a decision to shut loss-making bases over the winter season. "We continue to work 
with our people and their unions to finalise this process," it adds.

as he monitors stock prices at a brokerage house in Beijing, Monday, Nov. 4, 2019. Asian stock markets followed 
Wall Street higher Monday after unexpectedly strong U.S. jobs data helped to soothe worries American factory 
activity was weaker than forecast. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)BEIJING (AP) — Global stock markets rose 
Monday on hopes for progress in trade talks between the United States and China and on the back of strong 
economic data. 
London and Frankfurt opened higher while Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul also rose. Japanese markets were 
closed for a holiday. Market sentiment was lifted by Friday's U.S. jobs report, which was better than expected. That 
helped to dilute disappointment over a key manufacturing survey for the U.S., which fell for a third month. The U.S. 
data were "the icing on the cake" after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and the U.S. and Chinese 
governments issued "encouraging statements" about their tariff battle, said Craig Erlam of Oanda in a report. "Of 
course, we've had plenty of warm words before that have delivered very little but things seem to finally be moving," 
said Erlam. In early trading, London's FTSE 100 rose 1.1% to 7,384 and Germany's DAX advanced 1.2% to 13,118. 
France's CAC 40 added 1.1% to 5,825. On Wall Street, futures for the benchmark Standard ...or's 500 index and 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%. On Friday, the S...00 hit an all-time high for the third time in a week. 
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6% to 2,975.49 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.6% to 
27,547.30. Seoul's Kospi added 1.4% to 2,130.24. Sydney's S...SX 200 added 0.3% to 6,686.90 and India's Sensex 
rose 0.3% to 40,286.44. Friday's employment numbers helped to shore up investor faith that has been shaken by 
U.S.-China trade tension and Brexit. The world's largest economies have agreed to a truce in what President 
Donald Trump dubbed "phase one" of a trade deal. Envoys are negotiating the details, but economists caution 
major issues have yet to be decided. Corporate earnings, meanwhile, have been slightly better than expected. 
Among the companies reporting on Monday are Uber. In London, shares in Ryanair were up almost 8% after it 
posted upbeat quarterly figures. Shares in Under Armour Inc. were down a sharp 16% in premarket trading after the 
clothes maker said it is being investigated by federal authorities over its accounting practices. Shares in McDonald's 
were down 2.7% after its CEO was forced out over a workplace relationship. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 
75 cents to $56.95 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract jumped 
$2.22 on Friday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 92 cents to $61.61 per barrel in London. It 
surged $2.07 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar rose to 108.42 from Friday's 108.18. The euro edged

Nov 04, 2019( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON (AP) — Ryanair says it 
has dampened expectations that it would receive the entirety of its planned delivery of Boeing 737 Max airplanes 
next year. As the Ireland-headquartered reported profit of 1.15 billion euros ($1.28 billion) for the half-year to 
September, in line with the same period of 2018, CEO Michael O'Leary said the airline now expects to receive its 
first Max planes in March 2020. O'Leary said Monday that "we have reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft 
being delivered to us in advance of peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none." 
Europe's busiest airline has said it would cut flights and close some bases because of delays to deliveries of the 
plane, which has been grounded globally after two fatal crashes.
